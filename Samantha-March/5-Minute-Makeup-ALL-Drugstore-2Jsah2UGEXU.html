today I'm going to be doing a makeup
tutorial on this very simple basic five
minute look I'm using all drugstore /
affordable products it's a very simple
process if I use one eye shadow I use a
total of three brushes it's very simple
fast and easy when my husband comes to
me and says like hey we need to be out
the door in five minutes and I am
bare-faced this is usually what i end up
with so if you would like to see how I
got this five minute makeup you can go
in with the Maybelline master Prime and
this is the blur and illuminate primer
and basically what i'm using this primer
for is to just start to even out my skin
tone and kind of give it a healthy glow
because then i am going to come in with
a powder foundation but that's what i
use this primer for its i'm not really
using it to like prime my face and make
sure my makeup stays it's just more for
the skin tone and to give myself
somewhat of a healthy glow I mean next
I'm going to go in with the maybelline
fit me matte and poreless powder
foundation I have it in 310 it's in
powder beige and I'm just going to be
playing this all over my face using this
fluffy foundation brush from bhcosmetics
so instead of using like a liquid
foundation I just use the combination of
the primer and then this powder
foundation and it's just a pretty quick
and easy application for me it doesn't
take me too long to do and I think it
gives me some good color it gives me
that glow evens out my skin tone all
that good stuff I also do bring the
powder down onto my neck as well just to
try to make sure that I'm matching it
and that's all come in with some
concealer and I like to use the
Maybelline instant age rewind this is
like such a talked about concealer so
many people love it I have
a shade fairlight and it's got this like
fun top on there but what I do is put it
basically all around my eyes I put it
underneath my eyes and then I also put
it up here to kind of act as like a
primer instead of using an actual eye
primer I just use this concealer so I
just kind of bring it down I bring it up
and I put it in the little corner I
struggle with like dark marks in the
corner of my eyes so I make sure I put
it there just kind of surround my eyes
with it cover any dark circles kind of
brighten up under my i use it as a
primer I mean just get all sorts of uses
out of this one now I don't go in and do
the full like highlight routine how I
would normally like bring it down even
farther I put it on my forehead my nose
my chin we're in a rush so this is all I
do for concealer instead of taking time
to get my Beauty Blender wet and rinse
it out and all that good stuff I just
come in with this sephora airbrush
concealer their number 57 brush so I
just used this to blend out the
concealer i just press it in to my skin
all around here i blend it up to my
eyebrow i did not tie my hair back
normally i would have my bangs out of my
face i forgot to do that and I don't
want to go all the way upstairs so I
like to use a brush sometimes versus the
Beauty Blender it does take less time
for me which i think is really great but
if I'm just going to be doing like
around my eyes like this I don't feel
the need to bust out the whole Beauty
Blender route and this brush works
perfectly fine I think it was actually a
little bit pricey from Sephora it was
probably like in the twenty dollar range
and I think they have just as good if
not better brushes at morphe their
concealer brush I can't think of what
it's called right now but I have it in
my bag i'll link it below the concealer
brush that i'm going to be purchasing
here shortly to leave my face along for
a little bit and focus on my eyes i'm
going to take my BH Cosmetics a blending
brush and I'm going into my
makeup geek eyeshadows and i am using
this top center one it is creme brulee
I'm going to be using that one is going
to pick up some product and I'm going to
put it right in the crease of my eye and
just kind of blend it out and this is
the only shape that I'm going to be
using on my eyes that keeps the eyes
very simple when I'm in a hurry one eye
shadow and that's all I got time for so
I'm just going to use like back and
forth motions windshield wiper motions
just blend it all in my crease bring it
out a little bit once I don't have like
much product on my brush I'll kind of
bring it up and down as well when I am
in a hurry I still usually line my upper
eyes I don't know I just feel like I
look really young and also really tired
when I don't have Islander on the top so
I basically do this pretty much almost
every single time it's very rare to see
me without eyeliner on so I'm going to
go in with the maybelline a master
graphic I'm going to be using this
eyeliner and this is what it looks like
I'm just going to draw a line along the
top and just do like a pretty small wing
I'm not going to really take my time to
wing it out because we're doing this in
a hurry how I do the wing I have
demonstrated this before it is kind of
hard to show on care mouth not going to
lie and only have one hand but I just
draw a small line from like my lower
lash line up towards my eyebrow I just
drop with the like very pointed edge of
this eyeliner just draw a very small
line like that and then I just fill in
my upper eyelid once I have it filled in
I'm going to connect the wing over to my
line
and then if you can see how we have like
that shapeable Wayne right there then I
just take the eyeliner and the linen and
then I will go ahead and do the same
thing on the other side make that little
line fill in my eyelid just connect them
after the eyeliner is done I'm going to
line my bottom waterline and I'm using
the NYX traje la gel eyeliner pencil in
black or just line the bottom waterline
and with this one I kind of will get a
little messy cuz I'm not going to put
any like eye shadow or anything smudge
on the lower line so I kind of use this
gel eyeliner pencil to just kind of
smudge it out on its own
for mascara I'm going to go in with
Maybelline define a lash I really love
this eyeliner has had in my collection
for a really long time and it's almost
gone and I'm pretty sad about it to use
this to line the lower and upper lash
line but the wand looks like it gets a
very small but the wand is like very
flexible which when you're trying to get
all your eyelashes I think it works out
really well but it's just very precise
and I think the name fits it really well
like define eyelash because I feel like
that's exactly what it does they do have
the define a line eyeliner from
Maybelline if I bought these in a set
together and I actually really don't
like the eyeliner but love the mascara
which I thought was pretty interesting I
think the eyeliner just like smears and
does not stay put so I do not typically
reach for that eyeliner so that is the
mascara I just do one coat when I'm in a
hurry of course and finish up with my
cheeks i am using between the sheets and
this is from colour-pop i did just
mention this in my color pop hall and i
cannot open this blush because I closed
them so tight but that is between the
sheets and I'm just going to pop this
all over my cheeks i'm using my
stippling brush from ELF because of the
different consistency of these blushes
you kind of have to use a duo fiber
brush or stipple brush or your fingers
just a regular fluffy blush brush really
doesn't work with the moosie texture of
the colour-pop blushes
and then to finish off the look i'm
going to be using j lu j lose JLo's nude
and this is from l'oreal and it's just a
really great nude color I reach for it a
lot it's getting down there actually the
lip liner required for this one it's
very silky and creamy I know the l'oreal
smell is kind of weird and unfortunately
this does have the l'oreal smell to it
but i really like the color so that's
what I'm going is the final result I
hope you guys enjoyed that makeup
tutorial it really is pretty basic I
know a lot of times when I see people
say they do five minute makeup they
don't do the top eyeliner it's just
something that I prefer to do of course
if you're rushed or say you have
something else you prefer like some
people have to highlight their face or
some people have two bronze their face i
don't use any bronzer or any highlighter
or anything like that I didn't do my
eyebrows so that's just something when
it comes to me personally that's just
something that I really love to do but
this really is i did tie myself the
other day well i did this makeup look
and it took me like just over five
minutes to do it but also my husband was
talking to me at the same time and i was
trying to get changed this is my very
basic go to make up using the drug store
and affordable products i hope you found
this helpful i was going to do a
back-to-school tutorial and then I kind
of got busy with a few other things and
don't film it so it's a little late to
say this is a back to school makeup look
but I mean it definitely could be back
to school makeup if you are still
looking for ideas and now that you have
started school I will leave all of the
