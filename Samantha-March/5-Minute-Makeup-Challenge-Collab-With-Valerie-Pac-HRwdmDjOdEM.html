channel so I'm so excited for today's
video because it is another
collaboration video and collaborating
with my friend Valerie pack here on
YouTube and we are bringing you the 5
minute makeup challenge so oh boy that's
what a bare face because I'm about to
jump in to the 5 minute makeup challenge
and try to do all of my makeup in five
minutes we'll see how it goes but I'm so
excited to team up with Valerie she's
been a friend of mine on social media
for quite some time now I think we first
connected over Instagram and then it
just kind of obviously worked its way
into YouTube because that's how it goes
but I just I love her photos I love her
post her videos are so informative and
so helpful she is you know not only into
makeup but she's also a hairstylist and
her post about her hair her videos about
like how to do certain hairstyles I just
watched them over and over and over and
I'm so proud of myself because I have
finally learned how to French braid my
hair I have finally learned I'm 29 years
old and I've been trying for years to
understand French braiding and I think i
have finally got it and I definitely
credit Valerie for helping me because
her videos are just super super helpful
so if you're into makeup if you're into
hair definitely check uh Valerie out
she's just someone who I feel like would
be my friend if we like knew each other
like we lived by each other like we
would probably be friends and we'd
probably go out together and work out
together I know she's big into working
out as well which is awesome but it's so
funny because she's a twin my best
friend is a twin hmm I see she likes to
fish my husband likes to fish I mean I
just feel like we have like all these
things in comments but I'm excited we
decided a while ago that we were going
to team up and do something and then we
were just kind of trying to figure out
what to do and then Katie and Desi put
out there five minute makeup challenge
and I was like hey Valerie do you want
to do this one because that just looked
so funny to me and more people started
doing it and should spend a lot of fun
to watch and we decided we were going to
try to challenge ourselves and see how
we do so that's what I'm going to do
today so when I get into the actual five
minute makeup challenge part of it that
part of the video is
going to be edited at all it's just
going to be uncut uncensored see what
happens I wanted to challenge myself to
do more because when I first thought
about it I was like oh that's really
easy just do a BB cream and one eye
shadow and maybe just like a fun pop of
liner and boom you're done like you're
out I'm like no try to actually like
take the challenge take a look that you
know obviously isn't super hard like
crazy dramatic cut crease and huge
lashes and you know all this crazy
contour baking you know all that stuff
like don't try to go don't try to do
anything crazy but don't do anything
like super simple where you can do it in
three minutes and then you're like boom
I'm done so I decided for this challenge
that I'm going to be using the bronze of
Champions box this is from benefit this
is like one of my favorite purchases
ever but it's so handy because it has I
shadows right here that I'll be using
both of one sack room one is a powder it
has a contour right here it has a
highlight and it has a mascara so this
box will be really handy I could just be
grabbing out of it but I don't know
we'll see how it goes I don't know if I
can do it I haven't practiced in it so
we will see but big thank you to Valerie
of course for collaborating with me I
will leave her links to her Instagram
and her YouTube below be sure to check
her out give her some love let her know
I sent you be sure to watch her five
minute makeup challenge I cannot wait to
see it and see how she does but can you
tell I'm stalling because I'm kind of
afraid but all right I have to go i'm
using a Beauty Blender so I'm going to
go get my Beauty Blender wet so I don't
waste any time on that but then we are
jumping into it here is my five minute
makeup challenge hey guys so clock at
the zero and let's go ahead ah ok ok ok
ok this is really hard cuz I don't have
a table in front of me so everything is
behind me which is really frustrating
but for foundation I'm using the l'oreal
lumi cushion I'm going to shade n 3.5
i'm using my Real Techniques makeup
sponge I feel like I'm running out of
this foundation and I really love it and
I'm not excited about buying a new one
expensive
ah
when I totally forgot to youth Bremer
totally under present for that to use
primer black I'll bet feels incredibly
stressful like I feel it I feel stressed
already
okay I've already spent a minute on
foundation this is not good it's not
good i don't know why i went this route
why did I go to beauty blender route I
thought it would be fast for some reason
but it doesn't help that i actually have
somewhere to go after this so i like
they don't want to look super crazy okay
foundations guy maybe 20 s not your only
face concealer okay i'm using the
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
I just dropped the cap there's no time
to care about that I forgot to bring
over my g2 brush to blend it in so we're
going to have to use the Real Techniques
sponge I'm going to put it on my eyes to
to act as a I primer got my mirror my
gosh little stressful this is not fun so
far this is not much I'm not having fun
I forgot my brush to set it I'm two
minutes in i forgot everything no okay I
can't set can't you can't set we can't
fret oh no this has a lid okay so i'm
using this cream thing and my bumpit box
and a bh cosmetics brush and i put sad
oh I
super sloppy dub that was super super
super sloppy
okay i'm going to take another vh brush
looks like this i'm going to pick up the
powder shadow it's like a shimmery
bronzy brown shade on place bad in my
sig outer being kind of blended in blend
it all together on my words you don't
have a lot in the blood okay mostly
focusing now to be I'm going to look
crazy showing up to ballgame tonight I
am going to look crazy
okay I'm gonna know
okay I'm gonna contour and bronze i'm
using the hoola bronzer from benefit
that's in this kit and has still a
little brush i am three minutes and 56
seconds oh my god oh my god i'm not even
have time for mascara this went way too
bad i thought for sure this was going to
be a quick route oh my word i can't
believe how fast is your son this is
ridiculous and for some reason i thought
i was gonna be able to like chat with
you guys and like talk to you there's no
time for chatting kidding me okay that's
been um um um oh ok blush and going into
my blush elf palette
Thanks on black on blending it out i'm
using my morphe 400k 448 I don't even
have time okay five minutes I don't even
oh my word that was so hard I didn't
even get to put mascara on I didn't even
put eyeliner on I didn't have a lipstick
on I cannot believe that was five
minutes that went so fast oh my gosh
that went fast whoa alright guys so that
was the five minute makeup challenge and
oh my word that truly was so much harder
than I thought it was going to be a holy
crap I can't believe it I got what did I
get I got foundation and bronzer and
blush and two eyeshadows put down and
that's it I don't have time for liner
mascara I couldn't even think about
limps I had a lip liner ready to go like
wall that was so much harder I kind of
actually want to like retake the
challenge like down the road like I want
to come back I want to revisit the
challenge like I know in katy and
dezzy's video they actually did like
around two but I might have to do that
at some point because that was so much
harder than I really thought it was
going to be and I'm kind of bummed
because I was like no I want to like
challenge myself and do more and then I
think it was because the foundation took
me a minute appel I shouldn't have done
that a lot of people were using like
stick foundations for this and I don't
have any stick foundation but then I saw
a lot of people using the Beauty Blender
and so I thought that would maybe be
easier than a brush but I don't know
about that or I just or I just cared too
much I just cared I just cared too much
I have places to be after this I
actually wanted to look somewhat decent
my eyeshadows a little bit on the crazy
side but but that's okay whoa so that
was my vibe minute makeup challenge I
hope you guys enjoyed it that was fun to
do but so incredibly stressful i cannot
believe how fast five minutes 1 i'm
going to be so curious to see Valerie's
hopefully she did better than me i
wouldn't call
like a fail because I look somewhat
decent I just look like I'm having like
a very natural makeup day incredibly
natural i don't even have lipstick on
I'm having a very natural looking kind
of day but I hold Valerie did better
than me and I'm so excited to see her
video I challenge you you guys to take
the five minute makeup challenge because
this was definitely much harder than it
seemed to do much harder than I expected
it to be so I I challenge you guys to
time yourself and see what you can get
done in five minutes if you do it or if
you have done it please let me know or
tag me in your videos because now I want
to watch as many videos as I can like I
thought I'd watched a pretty good amount
of five minute makeup videos but now I
just want to watch even more and see
like what other people are doing to see
if I can maybe challenge myself for the
future to do it but again I will leave
links to Valerie's channel below thank

one will be nice and short to make up
for it but thank you guys so much for
