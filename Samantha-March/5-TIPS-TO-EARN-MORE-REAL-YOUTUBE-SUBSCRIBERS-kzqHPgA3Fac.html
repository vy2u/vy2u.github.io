today's video is going to be kind of a
tips video I'm going to be giving five
suggestions or tips on how to gain more
real YouTube subscribers this was I
requested video from a YouTube alive
that I did a couple weeks ago someone
write in and ask how to get more real
subscribers here on YouTube it could go
ahead and make a video dedicated to that
created a list of 5 tips or suggestions
that I think could help you gain more
real YouTube subscribers and they are
kind of what I have noticed that has
helped me gain more YouTube subscribers
as well this time last year I was at
5,000 subscribers and we are nearing a
30 thousand now one year later which
isn't a huge jump compared to some
channels but I still think it's a pretty
significant jump and I feel like I've
learned a lot in this past year and I
have some tips that I could offer to you
so if you would like to see it my 5
suggestions for getting more real
YouTube subscribers why don't we go
ahead and get started so for my first
tip I think this is one that you're
going to see in a lot of other kind of
YouTube tips videos but I do think it's
really important and it is to post
consistently I think with YouTube these
days people don't want to see people
only posting once a month or only
posting it twice a month so if you can
if it's if it's viable to you I suggest
posting at least once a week like
minimum once a week I would also suggest
trying to post more right now I am doing
a daily upload and I think that has
definitely helped increase my subscriber
count but I don't think a daily upload
is absolutely necessary I would say if
you can at least post like twice a week
or really try to aim for 3 times a week
I think that would be good before I was
going to daily uploads I was actually
posting 4 days a week I felt like from
there I saw an increase as well but just
do what your schedule allows of course
but if you can definitely have it at
least on your radar have it in your
vision to try to post more a week if you
can because it seems more and more
people want more and more content on
your channel but another tip that I have
to go along with that is to create a
schedule and let people know this is my
schedule before I started doing the
daily uploads I posted on Wednesdays and
that was my will I buy at Syria
I also posted on Thursdays I took off
Friday and Saturdays because I don't
feel like those days were really high
for my youtube channel and for my views
those were typically the two lowest days
so I went ahead and took those out and
then I also posted it on Sundays and
then Monday it also put that on my
YouTube banner I set it right there new
videos Wednesday Thursday Sunday Monday
and now you'll see on my banner it says
new videos daily if I change up my
schedule again I'll put it on there but
I would also say it in my videos having
a schedule really helps because one
thing that I was told about YouTube kind
of to look at it is that a lot of people
are using YouTube as their TV shows and
you know with your TV show that it's on
weeknights at 6 p.m. so when people want
to watch that TV show they know what
days and what time to tune into it so
another thing to kind of go along with
this tip is to try to upload at the same
time if you can if it's possible for you
to do so then as your subscriber count'
does grow your subscribers know that
they can come to your channel around
this time each day or the day that you
have listed your schedule and that they
will find a new video so for me I found
that posting between like 9:00 and 9:30
a.m. my time which is CST those are when
my videos we're doing the best and so
that is when I try to post every single
day around that time so that is my first
tip is to post consistently try to post
as often as you can have a schedule and
try to upload around at the same time
tip number one another tip that I have
and this video isn't only to gain more
subscribers but it's also to get more
views because views equals subscribers I
truly believe that your views come first
and then your subscribers a lot of times
people aren't subscribing before they've
watched any of your videos I want to
watch you they want to see who you are
they want to make sure they can have a
connection with you and that your
personalities vibe and then they
subscribe to you so I truly in my
opinion I think its views equal
subscribers but to kind of go along with
that one another tip that I want to say
is that you want to be yourself in your
videos and I truly have felt in the past
my hurt that I felt like that was the
lamest piece of advice like be yourself
on camera like I just let a piece of
advice I never really vibed with but I
now get it
get it and because I promise you if I
still didn't get it or if I thought it
was a lame piece of advice I wouldn't
put it in my video and I wouldn't be
advising people to do it really is true
and I totally get that if you first
start a channel the first couple of your
videos are probably going to be awkward
and you're probably going to feel
uncomfortable I did two if you go back
to my first videos I swear my voice is
like hi everybody thank you for watching
today's video like cuz I'm nervous
I haven't done this before I'm trying
something new I don't quite understand
exactly what I'm doing but over time you
should start to feel more comfortable in
front of your camera and you shouldn't
feel like you're just talking to a
camera you should feel like you're
talking to more people and then you
should be able to let your personality
come out but I think that subscribers
are very savvy and they know when people
are not being themselves they know when
people are being over-the-top and yes
bitch let's do all of this and if that's
not your personality people know that
and they can catch on to it because you
can come across as very force so I do
think it's really important to be able
to just be yourself and be as
comfortable as you can on camera and an
idea for that is that you can practice
you know you can make your videos and
record and talk to your camera and all
of that without having to upload them
because I I really do think that over
time you'll get more comfortable on
camera I think everybody's first couple
of videos are pretty awkward but you get
more comfortable over time other part of
you know being yourself on camera is
another tip that I have for more views
with that is to try to create some
unique content and that's one thing that
I've really noticed with YouTube lately
is that people seem to be kind of bored
with just only tutorials are only
unboxings are only hauls are only get
ready with me like people want to see
unique content as well and I'm trying to
do the best I can to come up with new
ideas and I know that there's a lot of
other youtubers that do it as well as I
think people want to see that especially
with how many channels there are on
YouTube right now and especially if
we're talking about the beauty community
there are so many beauty channels right
now and when we're all doing the same
thing are the same looks are were holing
the same thing as are we're doing the
same subscription boxes even people are
getting bored with that so people want
to see more
unique content that's definitely an idea
you know the anti falls were a unique
concept and then I did a spinoff of that
from the will i buy it series and you
know even doing something like you're
inspired by someone else's a video idea
or series or whatever it is and then you
can create your own spin on it I think
that's a pretty cool idea too it's kind
of hard to be unique on YouTube because
like I said there are so many channels
and so many videos you definitely
believe that there's still content out
there that hasn't been created yet and
then we will just keep coming up with
more and more ideas everybody's going to
be coming up with more ideas and more
unique ways to connect with their
subscribers and their audience so my
second tip would be not only to be
yourself be yourself on camera just be
who you are whether you're more serious
whether you're monotone or you're super
funny and kind of out there in your
videos ever it is that's your
personality bring that into your videos
but at the same time try to focus on
creating unique content as well and I
think that would help get more views and
more subscribers so another thing that I
think is really important to gain
subscribers is to interact in your
comment section responding back to
comments I think is something really big
that I think not a lot of people do and
I understand when you have a really big
channel and you have like millions of
subscribers and thousands of comments on
every single video I totally get that
that can be very overwhelming to try to
answer all of those questions and that
could turn into like a full-time job in
and of itself but I definitely say
starting out and then even when you have
you know somewhat of a bigger channel
definitely respond to your comments
because people like seeing that
interesting because when I go through
and respond to my comment I get back so
many comments as well like I can't
believe that you responded to me nobody
responds to me no other youtuber
responds and I'm like well why I think
it's something that's really important
that maybe a lot of people pass over
because they think it's not something
that's important but even just to say
thanks thank you a lot of times I'll do
like a smiley face it's just anything to
acknowledge that hey I appreciate you
taking the time out to comment on my
video and kind of to go along with that
one is to cross-promote on other social
media accounts I mean you don't have to
have
every single social media account out
there but I press promote all of my
videos on Pinterest and also cross
promote on Facebook Twitter and then I
usually do an Instagram story when I
have a new video pop up I will put it on
my Instagram stories again there's a lot
of other social media accounts and I'm
not saying that you have to have all of
them or even cross promote on all of
them but definitely cross promotion I
think is really huge and also to go
along back to the interaction interact
on your other accounts as well you know
respond back to your facebook comments
or your Instagram comments they'll
really value that because we like to
have that interaction it's why we sit
down and we watch youtube videos want to
make connections with people we want to
make real friendships with them and so
to interact with them I think is
something really big and something that
a lot of people kind of skip over as not
being an important part but I really did
want to include in this video because I
think interacting with subscribers and
with those who comment on your videos I
definitely think it will help but get
you more real subscribers another item
that I want to suggest to get more real
YouTube subscribers is to do
collaborations with other youtubers and
I think sometimes people can kind of
leave this out but so I am subscribed to
a ton of other youtubers right I mean
that just makes sense but I've also gone
on to make friends with a lot of other
youtubers and then we can collaborate
and do videos together believe my most
recent collaboration was with Olivia
from live loves her makeup we did a
collaboration video so at the beginning
of the video we each kind of like pimp
each other out basically or like hey
this is my friend you should go
subscribe to her channel we leave our
links and the hope of that is that my
subscribers who maybe haven't met live
yet are going to go over to her channel
and subscribe and then same thing live
subscribers who haven't met me yet
they're gonna come over to my channel
and hopefully subscribe so not only is
it great to collaborate because you can
kind of reach another audience that you
know there's a very good chance that all
of their audience even knows about you
yet but you are also getting real
subscribers from other youtubers and I
think a lot of people maybe kind of miss
that as well but I'm subscribed to all
of my friends is YouTube channel
not only just the big ones that we all
know about who have the millions of
subscribers but but also my friends in
the community and I think that's really
big and the more friends that you make
you know you guys all subscribe to your
channels that's a huge part of my
subscriber base honestly is my youtube
friends who have YouTube channels but
who also support me at the same time so
don't ever forget about the YouTube
community and your friends because they
also are your subscribers the one thing
that I did when I first started a
YouTube channel was that I would just
watch other people's videos I would
watch videos of you know recent videos
that I did say it's like I uploaded a
favorite highlight video I would watch
other favorite highlight videos and I
would leave meaningful comments on
people's videos I am never going to
suggest that you go to someone else's
channel and leave a comment saying I
have a channel to come subscribe or I
just uploaded a video come watch it
because that is not any sort of like
meaningful connection
you're not making friends with someone
can you imagine if like you go to the
mall and you meet up with your friend
and instead of saying like hi or how are
you they just immediately like ask you
for money they're like hey I forgot my
wallet at home I need some money from
you like don't just go to someone else's
channel only to self promote yourself or
only to ask them for something because
that's not how you form a friendship
that's not how you make a meaningful
connection with another youtuber look
keep in mind that other youtubers are
also your subscribers and to make real
friendships with them and then you can
go on to collaborate with them and then
you are trying to help your audience
find them and they're helping your
audience find you I think it's a really
cool way to do that I would also suggest
joining groups like I belong to a couple
Facebook groups that are like
specifically for beauty bloggers oh
definitely I think one way to get real
YouTube subscribers is don't forget that
other people who have YouTube channels
are your subscribers as well find ways
to form actual connections and
friendships with them and then also
collaborations can be really key as well
the last night that I want to mention is
the one that I really kind of feel
helped me the most and that was simply
starting to actually pay attention to my
analytics and I feel like now saying
I feel like it sounds like something
really obvious but it was something that
I missed
for a very long time it was looking at
my analytics and looking at which videos
did the best and then consistently
posting those types of videos so when I
started paying attention to my analytics
probably like seven or eight months ago
I would say I saw that the videos where
I would talk about makeup were doing the
best not my tutorials not even like my
makeup hulls but it was the videos where
I talked about makeup the will I buy
it's that I was doing the best and worst
video so I decided to take those and
consistently post those videos my
tutorials have the lowest amount of
views on my channel and I cut them out
completely and there was a couple
different reasons for that editing
makeup tutorials was really really hard
and then you know just when you add in
that those videos were getting the
lowest amount of views it was like okay
so why am i doing that but I took the
videos that I thought were doing the
best and what I did was like made series
out of them
oh my will I bite videos were doing
really well I decided to make a weekly
series out of the will I buy it and
those are consistently some of my
highest viewed videos and I think that
those videos have brought in a lot of
subscribers when I would post videos on
like makeup I regret buying makeup that
I don't regret buying and things like
that those were getting high views so I
do a video in my regret series well once
a month consistently and I'm not saying
that you need to make a weekly series
because that's totally a lot but even if
you take your most viewed videos and you
make sure that you do them at least once
a month I think that could really help
increase your views and then also
increase at your subscriber so go
through your analytics which can be kind
of overwhelming at first took me a while
to get the hang of I had to watch other
YouTube videos to almost kind of like
explain how to look at my analytics
because it was a little bit confusing
back there but if you take the time to
kind of understand all of the reporting
that's in there there is a lot of useful
information in your analytics if that if
you just take the time to understand all
of it and really help you get a handle
on what your audience is telling you and
I think that's really the most important
thing because how I kind of look at it
is that your audience or your
subscribers they are telling you what
they want to see and what they want to
see more of by consistently watching
those videos and so while I never want
to say that you need to only make videos
that are gonna have a ton of views and
I'm totally not a fan of clickbait
videos and I think a lot of you know
that I'm not a fan of clickbait titles
thumbnails videos any of that I don't
think that's a good way to gain real
subscribers never want to say that you
need to only focus on the views but at
the same time look at what your
subscribers are watching look what they
are consistently coming back to your
channel for and then make it those
videos so that's definitely like my
biggest piece of advice and I think once
I've really started to turn my will i
buy it series into a weekly series and
once I really took the videos that were
performing the busts for me and I
consistently made those videos I think
that is when I really truly started to
see a lot of growth with my youtube
channel so that is probably like my
biggest tip and my biggest piece of
advice to get more views on YouTube
which will equal more real subscribers
for your YouTube channel
here's someone who's just starting out
you know try a couple different video
types and just watch and see which of
your videos do the best and see which of
your video times do the best I decided I
was really going to get serious about my
YouTube channel and that was really
gonna like go all in on it I took a
couple weeks and I posted different
types of videos and I also posted on
different days and I posted at different
times
I made a spreadsheet and I would track
it and I would see which videos like
which video types are doing the bus
which days were doing the best that's
how I figured out for me that my videos
weren't doing the best on Fridays and
Saturdays your channel and your videos
might be completely different so you
can't go off of just my research and
what my channel is telling me you really
need to create your own research and
then I also tracked what times was it
was it better in the mornings was a
better in the afternoons was it better
in the evenings so I tracked to see and
I saw that you know that 9:00 to 9:30
slot in the mornings is what was working
best for me I definitely suggest doing
that if you really do want to see an
increase in your YouTube channel you
want to see increase in subscribers and
increase in views I don't think that you
can rely on something like a viral video
I would rather have real subscribers and
people who really want to watch my
videos than having a bunch of
subscribers and no but
is watching my videos you know what I'm
saying that's how I look at YouTube and
so in order to get that and in order to
find the success I truly believe that
you do have to put the work into it you
need to do the research you need to
watch your analytics you need to
understand what it is that your
subscribers want to see from you and
then you need to perform that you need
to act on that that's really my biggest
piece of advice and the thing that
really helped me out the most was just
watching my analytics and then in turn
going off of the research that I found
while doing it and I think that really
is something that helped contribute to
my growth and to my consistent growth in
my youtube channel but after that that
is going to be the final tip my final
suggestion of how to get more views and
real YouTube subscribers on your YouTube
channel alright guys that is going to do
