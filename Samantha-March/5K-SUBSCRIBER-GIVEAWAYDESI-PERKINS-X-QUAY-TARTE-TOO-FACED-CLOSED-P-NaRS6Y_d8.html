but I placed my the rest of this order I

days ago from sephora and it was right
when i hit 5000 and i was like oh man i

want to say thank you guys so much for

the last thing that the first winner
will receive is from I masasi Beverly
Hills it is the glow kit in sweets so
this is one of her newer glow kits I do
have to be completely up front to let
you guys know that I've already looked
inside this palette and a few of the
highlighters are broken so you might
need to take some rubbing alcohol to it
and try to fix them up I've actually
ordered four of the sweets glow kits for
myself and forgive aways and every
single one of them has come broken so I
still wanted to include it in the
giveaway and I did ask my snapchat what
they thought of that and they thought it
was a good idea because you can easily
fix him up with rubbing alcohol that's
what I did for the palette that I kept
for myself and they went back together
just fine and they look the same on the
eyes so the sweets palette will be
included in there you just might need to
give it some love all right number two
will also be winning a pair of the art
doll lashes these are their double
blushes I have these and I love them
like i said i like to include lashes and
every give oh I so I had to put one in
each box and you will also win the
Maybelline lash sensational mascara

colour-pop this is one of their cream
gel liners and the color is in get paid
I have this one and it's like a really
beautiful metallic rose gold one of my
favorite miners to where I love the
color pop liners hope you guys will be
excited for this one one while this is
their color icon ombre brush and might I
buy you a drink again this is one that I
have in it
absolutely loved it so much it reminds
me of luminoso from Milani which I love
as well so you'll be getting this one
and you'll also get a blush and
highlight palette this is from Smashbox
and it is in the shade Pacific Coast
pink so it looks like this so you have
two different blushes and then I
highlight as well I have a couple other
these pallets and I really really like
them and I am such a huge fan of first
aid beauty I talk about their skincare
all the time so I picked up this fab
cleanse and exfoliate and it comes with
a face cleanser plus 10 days of facial
radiance pads I love the facial radiance
had so much and constantly recommending
them to everybody so you will win that
set and then another set is like a
Sephora favorites which I absolutely
love the Sephora favorites and this is
their lash stash to go I've purchased
they continually put out new lash
stashes that make sense this is their
newest one so you get five sample sizes
of mascaras which i think is just so
very cool so there's one from marc
jacobs from milk makeup the Too Faced
better than sex is in there the new one
from Tarte is in there that I here is
really good and then they see out a
triple shot mascara so you can give all
of them a try I love these kids so much
and then the eyeshadow palette that I
put in here for you to win is from Tarte
that's their tartlet in bloom palette
again this is one that I've wanted for
myself for so long but I haven't gotten
it yet but I hear amazing things about
it and even though it's not like a super
super new palette people still rave
about this thing so I wanted to include
it in here because I think it looks so
pretty and I can't wait to get it for
myself but that is the eyeshadow palette
you will be winning and the last product
that winner too will be receiving is
from key Australia it is a pair of
sunglasses and collab with youtuber
dizzy Perkins these are the Heike
sunglasses so this is what they look
like they are super reflective so you
can see my entire room but i actually
did purchase these for myself and i
ended up just not really liking them so
i'm going to put them in to give away
before I ship them out to anyone I will
go and get them like clean since i have
put them on several times but i thought
they were just too big for my face like
I just
too small the face to be able to pull
off these oversized aviators so I
thought I would put them in the giveaway
and the high keys everyone seems to love
these sunglasses so much so hopefully
whoever wentz them that you will be able
to wear them better than I will because
I just did not look good on my face I
did get the on the low as well though
and I wear them all the time like I'm
super obsessed with those glasses but I
hope you'll be excited to win the key by
desi sunglasses because I know these are
really really hyped item those are the
two boxes that two different winners
will be receiving I am so so so excited
for this giveaway and have multiple
winners because like I said it is my
first one doing it in this format which
i think is really cool but of course the
rules to enter in the giveaway the only
thing that you must do is you must be a
subscriber to my youtube channel so if
you haven't subscribed yet make sure you
get subscribed because that is the only
way that you need to get entered to win
but like always there will be a link in
the description box below right at the
top you will want to fill that out
because it will take you to a generator
you need to fill that out and the
generator is what actually draws the
winner at the end of the giveaway so I
don't have anything to do with drawing
the winner it's completely random the
generator will select the two winners
for me and just get me their names and
emails and then I will email you guys in
the generator there will be some bonus
entries in there such as following me on
like Twitter and you know Facebook
Instagram snapchat all that sort of
thing I do offer bonus entries to my
snapchat I usually do that within like a
week or so after that giveaways been
running I'll put in a couple of bonus
entries that only my snapchat fan will
get so if you don't follow me on
snapchat I am Samantha dat March so if
you'll follow me over there but any
other bonus entries or anything like
that that will be listed right in the
generator as well so it should be really
easy for you guys to get the bonus
entries as well but just make sure
youtube subscriber and make sure that
you fill out that link so you will be
entered into the generator so it can
choose you this giveaway will be
international all of my giveaways so far
have been international and I just think
it's the fairest thing to do so it will
be international if you are under 16 you
do need parents permission to enter the
giveaway because you would need to give
me your shipping address if you are a
winner so i would need to have your
parents permission to make sure i can be
sending you a box of course on the
giveaway will run
for two weeks so I'm not sure when this
video will go live depends on how fast i
can get it edited but once the video
goes live in two weeks it will end on
that day I will put that date in the
description box below as well and
usually it's what they'd like three to
five days that I get the winner drawn
and contacted and announced it will be
the winners names will be here on
YouTube and I also renounce them first
on snapchat as well as well as
contacting the winners myself via email
so I think that is going to be
everything as always any other like
terms conditions rules etc will be
listed in the giveaway generator so
check there if you do have any other
questions or check in the description
box I will leave a lot of the other
information in there as well so if you
do have any questions check those places
first because your answers will probably
be found in there but again I just want
to say thank you guys so much I'm just
I'm so excited to be doing this giveaway
because when i first started YouTube
5,000 seemed like such a far away goal
so to be here it's very very exciting
I'm not sure what will be my next
milestone giveaway and I have to kind of
think about it and decide what I'll be
doing for the next milestone giveaway
but as soon as i know i will sure let
you guys know as well but i just want to
say again thank you so much i appreciate
everyone who subscribes who watches the
videos who leaves the comments and it
really just means so much to me i'm
really really excited to be sharing this
journey with all of you so thank you so

giveaway and i will just catch you guys
