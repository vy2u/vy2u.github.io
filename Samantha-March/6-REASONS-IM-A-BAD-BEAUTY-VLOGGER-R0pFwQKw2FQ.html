today's video is just going to be
hopefully a fun one it's going to be
like six reasons why i'm a bad beauty
blogger six reasons why out bad beauty
guru you know something along those
lines I never quite know what I'm going
to name these types of videos until I'm
actually like putting them live and it's
go time I need to think of a title but
we're going to be along those lines so
hopefully you will realize that this is
just kind of like a fun and
light-hearted video I'm not actually
like being down to myself or down on any
other beauty bloggers that does these
things that I do it's just supposed to
be fun and humorous I recently posted a
like 10 things i didn't know before
starting a YouTube channel or what did I
even named it ten things YouTube taught
me or something like that and it
received a lot of good feedback and I
was really glad about that cuz it was
just like a fun video that I kind of
just thought to do one day because I
always have these things that run
through my mind when I do something or
see something and I think to myself like
I didn't know about that or like with
this video I think oh I'm not doing it
that way or I'm not into that or I do
this differently times I'm like I'm
actually a pretty bad beauty blogger
aren't I if I think that way or I do
something that way so I don't know I
just thought it would be a fun type of
video but also because especially after
I posted the things that YouTube taught
me video I got so many snapshots of
people saying they really appreciated
the video and they appreciate my channel
because I seem like a real person and
honestly that is the biggest compliment
that anybody could give me when it comes
to being on YouTube is that you see that
I'm a real person I'm not trying to be
somebody else you know I'm not trying to
be on here and play games and change
myself or anything like that I'm just a
real person sitting in my office talking
to my camera about makeup and beauty and
I have so much fun doing it and
connecting with you guys and when I got
that type of feedback on that video it
just made me really happy and the other
type of feedback that I got was from
people who have either recently started
a YouTube channel or really want to
start a YouTube channel and they
appreciate it kind of like
the advice in the insight that I was
giving them because you know maybe you
don't see these types of videos a ton
not saying they're not out there but you
know they're maybe not the most popular
videos and people kept asking me
questions like that and you know if you
had any other advice to give or if you
you know thought of anything else what
is it that you could tell us and so when
I thought about doing this video I was
like you know what I should because
people want to know and so I kind of
want to bring you guys some of my
insecurities of being a beauty vlogger
and you know sometimes that I think I'm
not doing it right or I should be doing
something better and realize that you
know what I'm still very new to this
this beauty channel will start it in may
of this year so i'm very new but it's
been a fun ride it's been a fun journey
and I appreciate all of you coming along
for the ride so I just thought it would
be kind of a fun video to put out here
for you guys let's hop into the video so
if you would like to see six reasons why
a moped beauty vlogger please keep
watching so the first thing that we're
going to talk about you guys probably
already know you guys polarity know if
you've been watching my channel for a
while you probably already know if you
watched my ten things that YouTube
taught me you probably you probably
already know this so let's all say
together brows brows oh man when it
comes to eyebrows this was something
that I said in my what YouTube taught me
video is that people really care about
your eyebrows they care if you don't do
your eyebrows they care if you do your
eyebrows but it's not good enough for
them they really care about your
eyebrows and I feel like I'm a bad
beauty vlogger because I don't care
about browse I don't notice people's
browse and photos like when I'm going
through Instagram I am looking at the
eyeshadows I'm looking at the wing I'm
looking at the highlight I'm looking at
the lipstick I look at the brows last
because who actually cares about
eyebrows so passionately that you go out
of your way to comment and even direct
message a simple girl to tell her that
her eyebrows are crazy like I have I
feel like I have ruined so many people's
days with my eyebrows because they get
so upset about it I'm like I am so sorry
they didn't even know that eyebrows were
a thing I didn't know you were supposed
to do your eyebrows
before i got on youtube and i learned
real quick i learned real quick that's
the thing that you gotta do so I've been
practicing I've been trying like I tried
hard today and I don't I don't feel like
they look that good I think I need to
take like a class or something does
anyone offer a class here in the middle
of Iowa i'm not sure but i feel like i
should take a class because i just don't
feel like I'm getting it real well but
I'm trying guys like I'm trying not to
ruin people's days as much that I have
been but that's definitely something
that I feel like has made me a bad
beauty vlogger because everybody else
loves doing their brows and they have
great looking brows and I'm just over
here trying to get my brow game together
it makes me a bad beauty vlogger is that
I cannot whiten my teeth I cannot whiten
my teeth you that it is the most
frustrating struggle and it's not just a
struggle that i have since being on
youtube it is something i have struggled
with for years i have tried everything
to whiten my teeth from toothpaste to
like baking powder or baking soda I
don't even remember which one but it's
still in my bathroom I have tried like
natural remedies at home remedies white
strips I've tried every single brand of
white strips that there is out there
nothing works I was always getting so
frustrated and it doesn't help that i
have really sensitive teeth when i try
certain things it just hurts my teeth
too bad so I I don't even really get to
see like am I getting results because my
teeth just hurt too bad I've tried
whitening pens I even tried to team up
with a you know pretty well known teeth
whitening company and they sent me a
whole kid and I took before and after
pictures and I was like why doesn't this
work it works for everybody else I've
seen so many other vloggers talk about
this is the way that they wait in their
teeth like why are my teeth not getting
white and I actually emailed that
company and was like here are my before
and after photos but there's no
difference and he said it looks like
this is just my like natural shade of my
teeth and when that's your natural shade
you can't get whiter teeth like
apparently for like the teeth whitening
effects it's supposed to be for like
stained teeth like coffee or soda or
whatever and so if this is you
natural shade of your teeth it will be
really hard to get them wider using
regular whitening products that's what
I've learned that that's what you told
me and I was like maybe that's why
nothing works for me because it's been
so frustrating like there's some beauty
bloggers who are like all I do is use
like the whitening toothpaste and then
the white strips and now I have this
glorious beaming white smile and I'm
like that don't work for me so it's been
frustrating and I know like I don't have
perfect teeth by any means and I've been
called out it on Instagram before two
people are like wrong with her teeth and
I'm like really really never even had
braces like give a girl a break man
unless you want to pay for my invisalign
because that is expensive that has been
on my list of something to get for like
six years now but I cannot afford that
because that's some expensive stuff
right there so unless one of you want to
pay for my this line I'm not going to
get it for a while yet but it's been
frustrating and I feel like all these
other beauty bloggers have like the
perfect smiles and the perfect white
teeth and when they share all these like
lit photos especially they got the big
lips and the perfect white teeth and I'm
over here like I don't thank you it's so
frustrating but I wanted to share this
one just because I wanted to let you
guys know about what that company told
me about like the natural shade of teeth
and why teeth whitening doesn't work for
me because I thought that was really
interesting I've never heard that before
and actually the next time I go to the
dentist I'm going to ask him about that
and see what he says to that so yeah I
wanted to share that with you guys but
me and my teeth are not wide enough to
be a good beauty blogger the next thing
that makes me a bad beauty vlogger is
that I always forget to set my face like
set my makeup once I'm done you'll
probably see it in my tutorials that I
do like I put the lipstick on then I'm
like you guys are ready to go and I'm
like dang it i always forget to set my
face not even just on camera but in real
life i have max fix plus i have
scandinavia setting sprays i have a
mario badescu spray I have a new spray
from pixi by Petra yet I forget to use
them like all of the time and it's so
funny because you'll see like the other
Beauty vloggers videos and then at the
end are like and now douse your
faced with a setting spray and they'll
just sit there and just go to town on
the setting spray I just always forget
to do it I just just always forget to do
it's only been called out on it a few
times in my videos that people are like
to use anything to set your makeup and
I'm like yes I just I just typically
forget I'm trying to get better at it
you guys I'm trying to get better at
reminding myself I actually moved my
setting sprays they were all in a drawer
and I've moved them to like the top of
my desk there's like a little like cubby
shelf thing and I've moved him up there
so they're always in my line of sight so
I can see them so I'll try to remember
to spend my face more saying that makes
me a very bad beauty blogger a very like
naughty beauty blogger is that I often
encourage people not to buy my coat I
mean I should have Mike my beauty
vlogger status revoked shouldn't I
because most beauty bloggers are like
you need this you need that you
definitely need that you need that why
don't you go ahead and get that yeah
charge that and I'm like you guys don't
need all this makeup you don't need it
all don't worry about it if you can't
get it if you can't afford it or if it's
sold out you didn't get it don't worry
about girl don't worry about it and I
feel like that makes me a pretty bad
beauty blogger but some of my like more
popular videos to date are my anti halls
with an also of my will i buy it videos
where I discuss new releases and I talk
about if I'm buying them are not and
even with my anti haul videos the point
of those anti halls is not because I'm
like this is a bad brand this is bad
make up you know blah blah blah it's not
that a lot of times it's me saying I'm
not buying it because you know it's too
expensive because it's limited edition
because i have a palette that looks just
like that because i have 47 lipsticks
that look just like that their shows my
will advise it's me trying to show my
thought process when it comes to a real
person real person buying makeup because
a lot of times especially with the
bigger Beauty vloggers they're getting
sent these PR packages like amazing
crazy wonderful PR packages but I mean I
hope one day i will start receiving
because that would be amazing and save
me a ton of money that i could put
towards other things but I'm
getting them and so I'm trying to take
you guys through you know a real person
with a real job and what goes into me
purchasing makeup and so like in my last
will i buy it video I talked about a
couple I shadow palettes that I'm not
going to buy mostly because they're
limited edition and mostly because
they're expensive one of the palace I
talked about was a hundred dollars but I
also talked about something that I was
gonna buy with an eyeshadow palette and
I said you know there another reason why
I'm not buying the other two is because
I want to purchase this one and I mean I
have a lot of pallets definitely more
now that I'm getting on YouTube but I
don't have like four Alex drawers filled
with pallets you know what I'm saying
like I just didn't eyeshadow palette
collection i will link it down below you
can see it and even someone even
commented in there and it said it's nice
to see that you don't need all the
pallets in the world to still have a
good eye shadow palette collection and
I'm like yes I know if you encourage a
lot like no don't feel the need that you
have to have everything you don't need
to have every single new release you
know get the items that speak to you
that make you really excited the items
that you're gonna use a lot and you know
you don't have to feel like you need to
have all of these repeat items like you
don't need to have a hundred nude liquid
lipsticks if you don't want to you just
shouldn't have to feel the pressure to
constantly be buying everything because
it's just not realistic like as a
regular person we can't buy all the
makeup in the world even a beauty
blogger can't buy all the makeup in the
world you know I'm saying and we
shouldn't feel the pressure that we have
to so I feel like that's one thing that
really makes me a bad beauty bloggers
that I am constantly encouraging people
like don't feel the need to have to buy
everything don't feel the need that you
have to buy all of these new releases
and all of these new holiday collections
that are coming out like don't don't
feel the pressure guys so feel like
that's definitely one that makes me a
bad beauty blogger thing that makes me a
bad if you do blogger is that my setup
is so not fancy I mean you see some of
the really successful Beauty vloggers
and they have these beautiful backdrops
that like match the makeup look that
they're doing and or they have their
vanities in the back just full of like
bursting with beautiful makeup and oh
man I don't even I really don't even
want to move so you guys can see what's
behind me
a desk behind me you can see I have a
stack of books right there I really
don't want to show you guys the rest
because that desk is a disaster it's got
its got a lot of stuff on it and I like
where I sit cuz I sit right in front of
like the bulk of the desk so you can't
see it this is why I sit here so you
cannot see what is behind me because
it's a disaster I also don't have any
professional lighting I have no lights I
have no ring lights I have no anything i
use only and natural light to film I sit
in front of I have a very large window
in my office I sit right in front of the
window and sometimes you can see more of
my background because if it's like kind
of a cloudy day I will be pushed up
right against that window to get us much
natural light as I can I am right there
and my neighbor's walked by and are like
what is that girl doing in her window
she looks very strange and I get it I
have recently purchased the sony a 5100
four i bought the camera i was filming
off of my phone which is a samsung g6 i
used that to film all of my first videos
i bought this camera i think it was in
may I thought it with my tax return
money thank you so much it's kind of
like one of the most basic youtuber
cameras out there it's not super
expensive I think mine was maybe four
hundred dollars four to five hundred
dollars i got it at bestbuy but other
people have these cameras that cost like
thousands of dollars and do all these
crazy cool things I don't have that I
don't have final cut pro everybody edits
their videos with final cut pro or
iMovie now I don't have either of those
I used wondershare film aura to edit it
was like 50 bucks and works just fine
for me I don't get to do a lot of like
the fancy crazy things in there that
other people can do but you know what
I'm also new to editing so it was kind
of good to get my feet wet without
spending hundreds of dollars and being
super confused over Final Cut Pro
because I feel like it's kind of hard
but I also don't have anyone to help me
film or two film with me some people
have like nearly like producers for some
of their videos or they have someone
filming they have someone that can be
like hey you have lipstick on your teeth
because then goes my September favorites
video i filmed my entire intro with
orange lipstick like all over my teeth
and I was like whatever I don't care
I'm going to leap in there I love my
snapchat know like hey I know I got
orange lipstick on my teeth you don't
have to point it out I saw it my bad i
don't feel like we're doing the intro so
I don't have anyone to help me I don't
have a fancy setup I don't have a fancy
background I don't have fancy camera
fancy editing can see lights and you
know why I still make it work I make it
work and we do just fine I get kind of
frustrated over the lighting because it
means that i can only film so many hours
of the day and that time frame is very
small already and it's about to get even
smaller with winter coming in Iowa it
gets darker faster it takes longer to
get lighter so my time frame for filming
is about to be smooshed down quite a bit
but you know everything else I can I can
roll with and you know my first thing
that I did was I stepped up my camera
game the next thing that I'm going to
focus on is definitely lighting maybe
someday I'll get like a backdrop and be
able to do a backdrop or maybe I'll get
a vanity you can see the vanity I don't
know but for me right now this is me you
know what it works if you're thinking
about starting a channel but you're like
I don't have all this fancy stuff just
make it work in the begin and you can
make progress from there and purchase
the fancier things as you go along item
a guayabera beauty blogger is I don't
actually know what I'm doing guys so it
was so funny because I actually started
my channel as a book channel I'm an
author and a book blogger I have been
since i started my blog in 2009 i
published my first book in 2011 and i
started it as a book channel and i
thought you know what i want to do some
makeup videos too because my book blog
was once focused on beauty as well i did
have like a lot of reviews and so I
thought you know beauty is a really big
thing on YouTube I should make like some
beauty reviews and things like that and
kind of bring that element to my channel
as well and the beauty side just really
took off so that's why I decided to
relaunch it in May as just a beauty
channel I focus on the books on my blog
which is Chiclets plus and then I focus
on makeup and beauty over here on
YouTube sometimes I kind of combine the
two like when I have a book release for
myself which is coming up this video's
now that by November first I have a book
coming out November first I decided to
to make this a beauty channel and at
first I was like you know should i
because I don't know what I'm doing
I taught myself how to do makeup by
watching YouTube and I'm still not a pro
I'm still not an expert but even though
I'm not the best at it I was like you
know what this is what I like to do it's
fun I like talking about makeup I like
talking about beauty I like being able
to show you guys that even as a super
duper beginner with makeup i have no
makeup artist training I've never taken
a class about makeup I don't I don't
actually know what it is that I'm doing
but I was like why not why can't I start
a channel to and take you guys on my
journey with me I think that would be so
much fun so you know what sometimes I
think I might be a bad beauty vlogger
because I don't know how to do the best
thing ever but I still do makeup
tutorials over here gotten called out
before on Instagram like you don't even
know how to do winged liner know when
I'm learning so calm down like can we
all learn can't we all start somewhere
to be perfect to start a channel you
have to be the most knowledgeable person
ever about whatever it is that you're
talking about you just have to have a
passion for it and you just have to make
yourself go for it but yeah I definitely
want it to mention that one because i
feel like i say it in so many of my
tutorials like you know guys I don't I
don't know exactly what it is I'm doing
but I can show you guys how I do it and
you know I like watching people like
this who are maybe kind of beginners as
well or you know even trying something
new because it's more relatable to me
like when I see people that are like and
now we're just going to do a real quick
wing and all of a sudden they have the
fiercest sharpest wing of life and I'm
over here with you know holding a mirror
and I have my eyeliner and I'm like wait
how did you do that it's a struggle for
me it's a struggle for me so I like
making these types of videos because I
feel like there's more people out there
like me who maybe don't know maybe
you're a beginner maybe you're still
learning too and we can just do it
together so that's what what kind of
like drives me to keep doing it because
you know what we do we have to start
somewhere I can't let those comments
bother me about you don't know what
you're doing or your foundation doesn't
match or your wincleaner isn't
I don't care I'm learning I'm going
along with it I'm starting from
somewhere or any about starting a
YouTube channel and you're like you know
what I don't feel like I'm good enough
with makeup no matter start somewhere
you got to start somewhere with
everything so even though sometimes I
think I'm a bad beauty vlogger because
maybe I don't know exactly what it is
then I'm doing or I'm not the best at
makeup I don't care we have to start
somewhere doesn't matter to me people
can keep coming at me with the bad
comments so I don't know how to do this
or that doesn't look right that's fine
it doesn't bother me anymore guys I've
learned to like let those comments go
and just laugh at them doesn't matter if
you're putting out something that isn't
the most best quality in the entire
world that isn't the greatest thing it
doesn't matter if it's what you want to
do and if it's your passion it's what
you want to go for then you have to go
for it you really do have to block out
those negative comments or be able to
like somehow find the humor and them
because you know what those are the
people that are sad if you want to go
for something then you just have to go
for it like do I think that sometimes
I'm a bad beauty blogger because I don't
exactly know what I'm doing all the time
sure but do I let it bother me do I let
it stop me know alright guys that is
going to be it for the six reasons why
i'm a bad beauty blogger i hope that you
guys saw from this video that I was not
putting myself down and I'm not putting
anybody else down I'm taking the reasons
of why I think I'm a bad beauty blogger
and putting a positive spin on them
because you know what maybe i don't have
the whitest teeth and i don't have the
best browse and I don't have the
fanciest set up and maybe I don't know
what I'm doing but I'm still going after
it I'm still going after a passion of
mine and you should too you should not
let negative comments or insecurities or
intimidation stop you from doing what
you want to do whether it's with YouTube
whether it's with makeup or beauty what
there was with books whatever it is that
you want to do if you want to do it you
should just go after it and I just
wanted to make this video to you don't
encourage you guys maybe answer a few
questions that I get on my snapchat and
just sit down and talk to you about you
know my real life insecurities and the
things that intimidate me about putting
out three to four youtube videos a week
and you know how I deal with the
negative comments and how I can kind of
spend them into something either
positive or humorous or whatever it is
and to just show you guys that you
shouldn't let things hold you back I
started a YouTube
channel at one point I believe was in
2013 I stopped it because I didn't have
the confidence and it took me a long
time to be able to start a channel again
and you know what I'm just glad that i
did i'm disappointed that i lost all
those years so they could have been
giving experience and you know making
the videos but you know what I'm back
now i'm so happy that i did so i hope
this video helps you guys out if you
want to follow your passion whatever it
might be just go for it just try it you
gotta start somewhere but i want to
thank you guys so much for watching

that come in on you know snapchat

encouragement that you guys give me with
my videos and with my channel I
