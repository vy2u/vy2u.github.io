today's video is going to be 7 brands
that I want to try in 2017 so I have
chosen 7 makeup brands that I really
hope to try I haven't tried anything
from them yet but I hope that I do in
the year of 2017 I got this idea from my
will i buy videos if you aren't familiar
I post real I buy 8 videos every single
Wednesday I have a playlist I'll leave
it linked down below when I talk about
usually like new makeup releases and
makeup launches and just if I'm gonna
buy a product or not and kind of what
goes to my mind when I'm deciding what
makeup that I want to purchase and
there's often times there's so many
brains in there that I'm like purchasing
from this brand yet but I really want to
and it was just a couple wilayat videos
back but I said I think this year is
gonna be the year that I finally tried
this brand and I thought well maybe this
could make an interesting video idea I
have to say along with this video and
then also my will i buy videos i'm also
very selfish in making these videos
because i appreciate your comments and
your suggestions so much you guys don't
even know because you guys are
recommending to me what you love from
brands if you think makeup us worth it
like i get your feedback so much in
these types of videos and that really
does help me and helps me decide what to
purchase so when i was thinking about
making this video i was like now i can
get your guys's feedback you guys can
let me know what you think about the
brands what would you think about like i
think things like customer service and
shipping and all that stuff oh that's
very important it's not just the makeup
that we're buying but I think the whole
aspect the whole shebang is very
important and you guys let me know that
your opinions and and your feedback so I
thought this could be a good video not
only to sit down and chat about some
makeup and some makeup brands that I
would love to start using and I would
love to try out look at your feedback as
well so when I was making my list I
actually came up with seven right away
like right off the top of my head I
thought I'm gonna sit down I'm gonna
make this video tomorrow
last night I was deciding what brands my
going to talk about but seven on my list
immediately and then I was like ooh good
idea seven and 2017 because otherwise
this video could go on forever I thought
okay that's a good idea let's pick seven
let's highlight seven thought about it
some more and I was adding some more
brands and I thought you know what no
I'm gonna go with the first oven I'm
gonna go with my gut I'm gonna go with
the first seven that I
down and that's what I'm going to talk
about so I'm really excited to talk
about these brands about why I want to
purchase from them what I wanted to
purchase from them though why don't we
go ahead and hop into a seven brands
that I want to try in 2017 so the first
brand this was the first one that I put
on my list is a melt cosmetics I have
had my eye on health cosmetics for what
seems like such a long time but I just
haven't done it yet so Cosmetics is one
that you can only buy from their website
they're not in like Sephora or Ulta and
that definitely is a really big factor
to me because I purchased from those
sites so much because they have such
good reward programs and you can get
Ebates you can get cash back and all
that good stuff so I I tend to gravitate
more what I can buy from those stores I
know that I shouldn't solely do it I'm
not saying because you know i purchased
from morphe i purchased from sigma and
those aren't brands with Sephora Ulta
but majority of my purchases come from
over there what I really had my eye on
with melt cosmetics is their eyes shadow
stacks and I think one of the big
reasons why I haven't done it is because
I try not to buy so many eyeshadows like
eyeshadow palettes it's kind of what I
view as Stackhouse's like an eyeshadow
palette because you're getting a lot of
different shades in one I just think if
the concept of the stack looks really
cool I think it's very intriguing but I
try not to purchase a ton of eyeshadows
I wouldn't say I'm an eyeshadow palette
junkie I'm much more of like a lipstick
junkie purses eyeshadow I think that's
like the big another bigger reason
that's been holding me back from melt
but their stacks look so cool and I'm
looking at their website right now and
they have like the gunmetal stack it's
$48 sold out right now the rust stack
which I remember the rust stack was the
one that like got my attention I thought
it looked super cool
that's $58 for one four five different
shadows so a dark matter stack which
this one is sold out right now as well
as $48 for four shadows then they have
some more like single shadows and they
also have lipsticks and then I pigments
and I think that's all that not have I
just I feel like I hear really good
things about the eyeshadow stacks I see
a lot of people using them and I see a
lot of people you know grabbing
Saxe for a single color like someone's
doing an eyeshadow look and they're
using these different shadows but then
they're gonna grab the gunmetal stack
real quick because they're gonna grab
the dark matter real quick like I see
them coming into tutorials a lot even if
it's not just focused on that stack or
on what cosmetics but a lot of people
are finding ways to use them which I
just I find that really intriguing so
that is definitely what I have my eye on
to know from you guys you have any of
the eyeshadow stacks of Rome melt
cosmetics what have you thought of them
would you recommend them do you have any
of the lips as well for some reason I
like I said I'm such a lipstick addict
but I haven't gravitated toward their
lipsticks at all I was much more
interested in I shadow is probably
because that's what I typically hear
people talking about I don't feel like I
hear a lot of people saying like oh this
is my mouth Cosmetics lipstick I mostly
hear about the stack so I would love to
know but melt cosmetics is definitely
one that I hope to purchase from him and
it 2017 so next on my list is Julius
place I just recently talked about them
I've actually I've talked about them in
a couple will I buy at videos but most
recently I talked about the siharan
palette and I said that I was going to
do it I said that I really wanted to buy
it and I was super interested in it and
I know I've gotten a lot of follow up
questions like did I get that palette I
didn't because because I decided to
order another high-end eyeshadow palette
and I'm going to talk about it next so I
decided to purchase a different palette
so I was like maybe I'll skip over the
Sahara palette for right now and then
another reason that I've factored into
this is when I was thinking about it I
was told from someone in a group that I
belonged to that they heard that Julius
place was going on HauteLook and if
you're not familiar with hautelook it's
a website where like brands can put
their products on there and run
campaigns and their products are gonna
be very very discounted I've gotten
beauty products from there before I've
gotten closed on a whole look I don't
use them as much as I did I think when I
first became aware of the website
probably like three years ago four years
ago I used to look like almost every
single day seeing what was on HauteLook
and I just I just don't as much anymore
but when I heard that
like okay maybe I'll wait and I thought
to myself I was like surely the Saharan
palate isn't going to be on there
because it's a really new release but I
was like the other like the nubian
palate that will probably be on there
and maybe I can get one of those
palettes at a cheaper price and then
test him out and see how I like them for
myself even though I feel like I hear
mixed things about the eyeshadows but I
feel like it's mostly on the good side
and as I'm filming this video it was
today that it was going to be on
HauteLook and it was the first thing I
did this morning was I went and looked
at the website it was completely sold
out every single Julia's place I had him
on there was already sold out I'm like
did that what ha well it's so I'm super
bummed because I can't remember what the
price is worth it was the pallets were
like originally $34 and they were on
sale for like 17 or something like that
but it was gonna be a good price so I am
super bummed that I missed out on that
they are definitely a brand that I would
love to try in 2017 again more of an
indie brand so they're not gonna be at
Sephora Ulta but I feel like if you're
really good things about them a lot of
people have discount codes for them I
think when you go to the website I don't
remember how I got there at one point
but I was on the website they have a
whole page that just like shows all the
discount codes that you can get which I
thought was interesting so if there's
always like a 10% discount code that you
can get it so you know that you're
always going to get a bit of a discount
but they really are a brand that they
would like to try in 2017 and now once
again I'm still thinking about the
siharan palette it's still still in my
mind still over here but I'd love to
know if you guys got the palette or what
else that you would really love from
Julia's place let me know what you would
recommend in the comments down below
okay so I said I was talking about
high-end palette that I did get so a
brand and I believe this was the brand
that I said in my really buy up video
that like I think 2017 is going to be
the year that I try lorac I guess I did
it and I think it was last week so I buy
a video I talked about their brunch
palette I did it I got it I was really
excited because I got a 20% off coupon
it from Ulta and it included prestige
brands a lot of times when Alton does
their coupons they don't include the
prestige side of
it's mostly just the drugstore
affordable side that you can use the
coupon on so when those prestige coupons
come out I'm on it and I got I got
really excited for it and I went ahead
and I did purchase the pallet I always
hear really good things about lorac I've
mentioned them in a few will i buy
videos and everyone's always saying to
me that you guys really like the
eyeshadow pellets and you definitely
think they're worth it
so when the brunch one came out it was
one that it did make me do a double-take
I loved all the pastels in there I
thought it was really unique very cool I
love brunch so that definitely helped
like that gave it an extra check and the
yes category and so it was $44 and when
I saw that I could get the 20% off as
well and Alta I was like I'm going for
it and I did I do not have it yet it's
supposed to be getting to me in about
two days after I'm filming so I should
be having it soon I promise that I will
do a video right away on it so you guys
will see it and kind of probably I'll do
like a first impression type of video as
well and then I'll also do a review on
it also after I've can use it a couple
more times and do some tutorials with it
I'm really excited about it didn't want
to make sure to keep lorac in this video
because it was kind of the lorac brain
that spurred the idea for this video so
I thought I could include it I thought
we could let you guys know that it
definitely was a brand that I want to
try in 2017 and I'm excited that I'm
gonna be able to I want to let you guys
know I got the French palette it's
coming to me soon I'll let you guys I
want to thank Dan the lookout for that
upcoming video I'm very excited to get
it and see what I think about it but let
me know in the comments did you guys get
the French palette as well if you
already gotten it what do you think
about it or what are some other lorac
products not even just eyeshadows but
just other lorac products in general
that you would recommend I'd love to
know so the next brand that I hope to
try in 2017 is violet Voss I have not
tried anything from by the boss yet I
have not made a purchase from them
again this is another brand that's not
for a Ulta more of an indie brand and I
actually have my eye on a couple of
different products from them I'm
definitely curious about their eyeshadow
palettes they have a lot of really cool
eyes shadow palettes I know they did a
collaboration with youtuber Laura Lee
and a lot of people were excited about
that palette they do have a new palette
coming out I believe as a new palette
it's called the right or die I can't
remember if that one is a brand new
palette or if it's a rerelease because I
think they dish did every release of
another palette might have been the Holy
Grail but their palettes just like look
so cool they look huge like so many of
their palettes I'm looking at the writer
die right now on their Instagram it has
so many different shades how many of you
even shades is that one two three four
five six seven one two three four five
six what 7 times 6 42
mathesar so two if I'm wrong you don't
have to tell me because that'll be ok
but their palettes they all they all
look so ginormous but cool and beautiful
and I don't know I just feel like I hear
a lot of people talking about their
eyeshadow palettes so it's definitely
one that I'm very interested in but
another thing that I'm interested in
from violet vos is their lashes because
I have eyelashes like I have a problem
when it comes to eye lashes IRA eyelash
is almost every single day I don't even
have to be filming a YouTube video I
don't have to be taking makeup photos I
just like wearing lashes but I feel like
I hear good things about the violet boss
lashes too so those are the two things
that I'm really eyeing from violet boss
I believe they have more in their line
but the eye shadow palettes and the
lashes are what I'm most curious about I
would love to know I would love to get
your feedback like I said this is a very
selfish video I'm just asking you guys
to help me out over here that's really
what this video is about what I feel
like but I would love to know your
feedback on if I look boss because I am
eyeing them real hard for 2017 I told
you guys that I love eyelashes and so
that has to do with my next brand that I
want to talk about which is Koko lashes
I had a lot of different lashes that I
thought about including in here but Coco
was the first one that I put down on my
list and I was like nope I'm going with
my original list I hear so much about
Koko lashes in Queen B from lost our Lux
I also hear a lot about the Koko lashes
in goddess but what kind of confused me
a little bit was when I was looking up
these lashes to purchase it doesn't seem
like Coco lashes has their own website I
could only find them on Lady mass comm
and so I was a little unsure so I know I
some of you have purchased the cocoa
lashes because I you guys recommend them
to me so I'm very curious you get them
from lady moths calm because I don't
really know anything about that website
or is there anywhere else where you can
get Koko lashes I was a little confused
by that I was a little bit taken aback
when I was doing my research for it I
was like wait a second how do I order
these lashes now I'm very confused and
like even on their Instagram they don't
have like a link in their bio to their
website or anything like that so I was
like okay I was a little caught off
guard in that moment but the lashes look
to be pretty affordable like the queen
bee and the goddess lashes were both
$7.99 which I don't think is a bad price
I just bought some our adult lashes the
other weekend at the drugstore and they
were like 550 or something like that and
they were also buy one get one free but
that's our del butt so I've been very
curious about these lashes would really
like to pick some up I think I want to
give both goddess and queen bee but I
would love to get your guys's opinion
which styles would you recommend and
then also what can you tell me about how
you order from them because I'm very
curious if there's more places where you
can order from but please let me know
what you know how about Koko lashes in
the comments down below so another brand
that I talked about recently in a will I
buy a video is Kevin Kwan
I've never purchased anything from Kevin
of Kwan but I feel like it was that will
I buy a video that put this one on my
radar I think it's kind of never gone
away I was talking about in that video
the Neo limelight and the Neo highlight
that was recently released these were
each $58 for like a blush or a highlight
and I said in my will invite video that
I thought that was just a little bit too
expensive for me to do but I've also
heard really good things about the
sculpting powder and that's 44 dollars
and I'm really like contour powders I'm
very into them especially right now at
this moment but another good thing
interesting thing about Kevin Taquan but
I think is gonna be the only brand that
I'm talking about in this video you can
purchase from Kevin of Quon products at
Sephora which I think helps a lot I
believe there is a vib sale coming up
I'm not exactly sure when but I'm
starting to hear people talk about I'm
getting my VIP list right at you and I'm
like do I need to get my VIP sillas
ready because I'm gonna get that ready
so I think I
I'd like to purchase something from this
brand during the sale where I probably
have like the 20% off coupon give it a
bit of a discount and see what I think
I'm really eyeing the sculpting powder
pretty hard because I know that I would
really get a lot of use out of it now
this has been a brand that I mean I had
heard about him before I did that while
I buy it
of course and I did the will i buy it
video so I searched a little bit more
into the brand a little bit more into
the products looked more of three views
and now I can't get it out of my mind
I can't okay I can't get it out of my
mind so 2017 can very well be the year
that I make a purchase from the Kevin
Kwan brand but I think I'm gonna try to
wait for a discount because it is more
of like a high-end brand very expensive
brand so wait till I get a bit of a
discount and then see what it is that I
want to purchase from them but I would
love to know have you purchased anything
from Kevin naquan and what would you
recommend okay so the last brands I'm
going to talk about for this video and
for brain that I would like to try in
2017 is Beauty bakery this is a one that
I really have you guys thankful you guys
were asking me of us gonna put it in
will I bet videos and if I purchased
anything from this brand before so it
was really you guys I got this brand on
my radar and once again once again on my
writer I'm having a hard time getting it
off the first thing to me is that their
packaging is so I caching and just so me
this it's what the brand says it is the
beauty bakery so it has definitely like
the very bakery type of theme and I just
think that packaging is so cute I'm not
gonna lie but it also looks like they
have a lot of different products they
have lip products they have eyeshadow
palettes they're coming out with a
setting powder which i think they call
like the flower powder or something like
that you know some spin on the bakery
theme as well but I just think it's so
cute I believe that they have a
collaboration coming up with Olympian
and Gabby Douglas I think she's doing a
some lip products with them which i
think is very interesting but just
scrolling through their Instagram I mean
it looks like they have a lot they are
an indie brand I believe that you would
just purchase them from the Beauty
bakery website they are cruelty free and
vegan I'm sorry I haven't been saying
that for the brands but I'm just on
their Instagram now and I'm seeing that
and I am I'm very curious about this
brand I really would like to make
from them it might sound strange but I
kind of want to do this setting powder I
like setting powders as well I say not
in a lot of my videos that I feel like I
gravitate towards strange makeup things
that not everybody gravitates towards
but for some reason that setting powder
seems to be like calling my name but I
know they have some really cool lip
colors in there as well but again of
course I would love to know if you've
purchased anything from Beauty bakery
and what you would recommend or is this
a brand that's on your radar as well to
know if you guys have purchased anything
from them or if you're going to but
definitely Beauty bakery on my radar for
2017 alright guys so that's gonna be
everything for the seven brands that I
want to purchase in 2017 I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video and
just found it fun or helpful or
entertaining in some way but as always
like the theme of this video is leave me
some comments down below let me know
what you think about these brands that I
chosen for this video have you guys
tried them are they like your ride or
die brands your loyal to them or you
want to try them or let me know what
brands that you want to try in 2017 as
well like I said this was like my
initial 7 my gut feeling 7 the first 7
that I wrote down but there are so many
other makeup brands out there so many I
mean I could make like 47 of these
videos and still keep going with brands
that I want to try but I'd love to know
as well with brands that you really have
on your radar for 2017 that you really
want to make a purchase from and finally
