today's video is going to be 7 brands I
think you should try in 2017 so if you
guys caught it a couple months back I
believe it was I did 7 brands that I
want to try in 2017 and I basically just
lifted off a couple of brands so I've
been eyeing that I really wanted to
purchase from and then I was hoping 2017
would be the year that I did when I was
getting ready to sit down to film today
I actually had something else in mind
and somehow this just popped in my head
and I think it's because I've been
talking to a lot of people especially on
my snapchat and saying things like I
really think you should try this brand I
really think you should try this from
this brand like oh you haven't tried
this brand yet I highly recommend them
and so when I was thinking about filming
all of a sudden it just popped in my
head and I thought well I'm just gonna
roll with it so that is exactly what I'm
going to do today so I'm going to go
through a set of brands that I think
they should try in 2017 if you haven't
yet hopefully you have but in case you
have in case you haven't heard these
brands tried anything from them I'm
going to let you know why I think that
you should try them and also share some
of my favorite products that I would
highly recommend from each of the brand
always love recommending makeup and
letting you guys know some of my
favorite items so I'm super excited to
do this hopefully you guys like this
video I know it might be a little bit
different but my 7 brains I want to try
in 2017 went over really well
I'd actually kept meaning to film a part
two of that because people are requested
a part two so this can kind of be like a
part two except it's all about you guys
smell so some of the brands are going to
be like smaller brands some of them are
going to be ones that I just don't think
it gets as much hype as maybe other
brands do or just ones that I like
really feel passionately about or really
have some items that I definitely would
want to recommend to you guys so that is
much they studio is going to be some in
France that I think that you should try
in 2017 if you haven't yet but why don't
we go ahead and get started the first
brand that I think that you should try
in 2017 if you haven't is pure cosmetics
if you guys been following my channel
for a while this is going to come as no
shock to you because I have been saying
I mean since I started my channel that
Pierre is one of my favorite brands and
I definitely feel like they're super
underrated I know that I have filmed and
underrated makeup and brands video in
the past
and I have mentioned peer because I
think they do amazing work they have
really good products but I feel like I
don't hear a lot about them and whenever
I seem to talk about peer there are so
many people on social media on snapchat
that are like I've never tried anything
from this brand yet and I'm like get on
it you got to get on it so in case you
ever tried anything yet from peer I
think 2017 should be the year that you
do and I'll go over a few of my favorite
items I have been wearing peer it's
since my college days the very first
thing that I ever bought from them was
their foreign one pressed a mineral
powder this is I don't even know what
number this is for me but it's
definitely in the double digits I'm
super excited that this palette is
coming back and staff I have talked
about it a lot I was so bummed out when
it went away because it was a
collaboration nearly collapsed our
limited edition but there has been so
much success with this palette and so
many people love it and I was definitely
one of those people that emails pure I
was like hey you really need to bring
back the trolls palette and they are I
think that you could still get it at
Kohl's like sometimes it was on the cold
website sometimes I didn't see it there
sometimes people said that they found it
in their Kohl's but it was a
limited-edition palette but it is now
back and it is available once again on
the peer website so I'll have it linked
down below but I freaking adore this
palette it is so good they're following
me on Instagram you know that I do a
makeup tutorial almost every single day
I would say at least four or five days a
week and posting a makeup tutorial and
you see me use the pure cameo contour
stick so much I love this little guy so
one side is a concealer and then the
other side is a contour shade I use it
the most for contours I think it's an
amazing contour shade but yes you
definitely see me using this all the
time I highly recommend the Cameo
contour gear came out with flashes and
if you know me you know that I love
lashes of wearing falsies I just
I've always been wearing lashes since
before my YouTube day since before I
knew how to actually apply false lashes
I've been wearing them and I love them
so then Pierre came out with lashes and
they are just the freakin bomb I can't
stop wearing these lashes my favorites
I'm wearing flirt on my eyes right now I
love wearing diva they are so good
especially for
no liner days like the sabaeans I'm just
so like thin and they just look so
natural on the eyes bombshell is
gorgeous for more of a ba-ba-boom
trendsetter is more almost to like my
natural lash because they're a little
bit shorter they're not like super
fluffy or with me but I wear them when
I'm going for a more natural base and
still wearing false lashes but the pure
lashes I cannot separating about these I
think they're absolutely fantastic and I
definitely recommend checking them out
so those are just a few of my favorite
items from here I have a really big Pere
collection I do have actually a full
collection I started my new makeup
collection series this month where each
month I'm going over everything that I
have from a certain brand and I think I
kicked it off with Pierre I think Pierre
was my very first one that I did in
January because it's just really a brand
that I love I don't feel like it gets
enough hype and I feel like a lot of
their makeup is like underrated so I
wanted to share some of my favorites I
highly recommend Pierre I'll have the
Pierre website listed down below you can
also get them at Ulta beauty and some of
the items that you can also find at cold
those are some of my favorites but I
highly highly recommend Pierre if you
haven't tried them out I challenge you
2017 let it be riyer that you do well
leave me some comments down below let me
know if you do have anything from Pierre
if you love the frame as much as I do
and if you have a favorite or if you
plan on trying them out in 2017 the next
friend that I want to talk about is
Smashbox cosmetics now I kind of debate
it Smashbox because to me I feel like
Smashbox is a big brand but at the same
time I don't feel like they're as big as
maybe some of the other ones and I don't
feel like they're my just gets as hyped
as some of the other ones and there's a
lot of times once again like I mentioned
with Pierre where I recommend something
or say like something from Smashbox and
people are like oh I've never bought
anything from Smashbox I've never tried
anything from Smashbox
I mean I've even had a few people say
like I haven't heard of Smashbox now I'm
like really so when I was thinking about
this video I was remembering those
comments on it guys and I'm like you
know why I am me put Smashbox in there
because I really like them once again a
brand that I started buying from before
my YouTube date and that I really just
felt like I gravitated towards like you
know how you have those brands that
there's your brand's you're loyal to
them you get excited for their releases
you buy a lot of their products and then
there's
brands that you just don't gravitate
towards like each of these brands and
I'm talking about or ones that I
gravitate towards and at Smashbox I
definitely do so one thing that I want
to mention is there Smashbox there photo
that eyes palette now I mentioned this
when I did my top 5 customers eyeshadow
palettes I mentioned this one and I put
it in the best category when I got this
which was that last summer I think maybe
I bought it I was obsessed with it and
could not put this palette down lower
item from Smashbox I know this one has
gotten a lot of attention which makes me
very happy because it definitely
deserves it if they're always on liquid
lipsticks these are phenomenal I did a
top 5 best and worst lipstick video and
this was in it and I was watching a lot
of like best and worst lipsticks and I
swear the always on top mentioned it so
often those recent item that I have from
Smashbox and I'm just like truly 100%
obsessed with is their collaboration
with Casey homes its the spotlight
palette and I have mine in Pearl this
little guy is amazing I highly recommend
it but yeah those are a few items from
Smashbox that I absolutely love but I
definitely recommend Smashbox as a brand
as well I've always been really
impressed with what do they come out
with and I don't feel like they're a
super overwhelming brand which I also
appreciate you know how some branches
come out with too much too much too much
too much like like I feel like Smashbox
actually lets me get excited for their
releases because it's like we finally
get into really some Smashbox that's so
exciting I want to buy it whereas this
other branch or like oh my gosh
you're coming else another collection
okay sure you know so I appreciate that
about Smashbox and P result but let me
know in the comments down below what you
have from Smashbox that you absolutely
love or recommend or are you going to
try them in 2017 so the next brand that
I think that you actually try in 2017 is
a drugstore brand and it is a pixie
beauty so I had not tried anything from
pixie beauty except for their glow mists
I was hearing so many good things about
it I went onto my target and I finally
bought it and I was like okay I get what
people are raving about like this is
awesome
and then I've never really bought
anything else from pixie because even
though they are drugstore and like I
said you can find my target they're more
on the higher-end size for
drug store so sometimes I'd be like I
think I'm going to get that I'm not sure
if I'm going to get that like it was
like one of those types of things that I
wasn't sure about and recently I have
been added to the pixie be DPR list
which is amazing and I'm so thankful for
that I've been really excited to get on
the pure list because I realized that
this is a damn good brand and I was
sleeping on it
seeing that they did send it was the
first PR package I actually got from
them was a huge box it was of the full
collaboration that they did or the full
collection that they did in
collaboration was for beauty influencers
these for like the standouts these were
in collaboration with Miriam NYC they
are like bronzer blush highlight palette
and they are bomb these are in
collaboration with Aspen overs and the
highlights they are awesome and I have
seen a lot of other people raving about
these as well
GM u89 is one of them that I believe
I've seen coffee burg with Danny I
believe this talked about these as well
these are no joke these highlights are
amazing they are beautiful and they are
popping but they are soft on the skin
they don't show texture they day like
these got me good I also love their
makeup mists and I've been saying it my
videos that I've become very obsessed
with makeup mists and it is so true
so this is my glow mess this is what I
originally purchased and if you want
look glow to your face this is give it
to you but I am obsessed I don't even
know I mean you can tell but I have put
a dent in this and I got this pretty
recently this is the hydrating milky
mess with hyaluronic acid and black coat
okay so it's a youth preserving mist I
just turned 30
so I basically bathes in this every
single day but also a lot of times in
the morning again look at how much I
just got these very very recently this
is the vitamin wake up miss with orange
blossom and citrus extracts this is so
good I kind of go back and forth between
these two but I use them almost every
single day and sometimes I will just use
well either both of these I know I've
done it before even if I'm not doing my
makeup but I'm like AHA my skin is like
a little thirsty I'll just spray my face
even if I'm just going to stay here my
office makeup free all day I just
sprayed these because I'm obsessed with
them I have a problem I highly recommend
them
I've heard a lot of people talk about
this uh hydrating milking myths I was
actually going to buy it because I
started to hear a lot of hype about it
and then a package showed up from pixie
no hook no way so I mean if you were
like me and you weren't sure about
getting pixie because he has structure
but yeah it's a little bit more
expensive I hope that these
recommendations help you out and I
really hope that you do get it because
this is a brand that I was like actually
disappointed that I was snoozing on I
really was so yeah I really wanted to
share those recommendations with you but
let me know what you have from pixie is
there anything that you absolutely love
are you going to try them out in 2017
what do you want to try let us know in
the comments down below
spraying that I want to talk about and
recommend is number seven and this was a
brand that I never even had on my radar
day I got an email from number seven
they said can we send you a package with
you know like for you to try out some of
our products and I said sure and I sent
it and I kind of looked into a little
bit more you can get in my drugstore so
I get this package fantastic package on
full of great goodies and I was like oh
you know okay so the first thing that I
do is pull out the bronzer obviously I
pull out the bronzer first and I'm like
okay you know that's like really nice
packaging looks good I open it up and
immediately I'm like okay a mirror
that's awesome so like look how gorgeous
the bronzer is how's that hmm okay and
I'm the shade that I've been loving is
caramel and I am obsessed with it if you
follow me on instagram you see me using
a lot of tutorials because I just I
can't help myself I'm fairly confident I
mentioned this in a favorites video or
in my makeup mostly video and I put it
in my favorites section I was like okay
that went really well let's try
something else so then I grabbed a
concealer the radiant glow concealer I
think I actually put this one in a first
impressions video and you could tell in
my video but I was like wait a second so
since you frickin awesome concealer it's
called the radiant glow concealer and
that's exactly what it does I'm actually
wearing it today it does give your under
eyes a beautiful healthy looking glow
which I didn't know I was missing from
my concealers but once I started using
it I just became obsessed with it I was
reaching for it so so much I actually I
was going to go out and buy the
foundation I saw GMB v89
talking about I believe it lifts the
state permit Foundation but I thought
she was talking about and number seven
actually DM me on Instagram and was
like can we send you something else I
was like the foundation maybe I would be
cool and they didn't need something like
five different shades of the safer route
Foundation I was like oh my gosh that is
amazing I'm wearing it today I've been
wearing it the last probably I don't
know three days in a row so far
big big big thumbs up for me I don't
know like is there something from this
brained I'm not going to like I'm sure
there has to be because there's always
like does our products that you just
something along with from brand so I'm
sure there's going to be something from
number seven that I don't absolutely
love have been really impressed with
this foundation but seriously number
seven this is like I said a brain but I
did not have on my radar and now I'm
like constantly recommending it I'm
finding it at the drugstore so I can see
what else they have available they're
also available and also so I'll have
them linked down below but I have just
been super super impressed so if you
haven't tried anything yet from number
seven I highly recommend that you try
them out in 2017 but of course let us
know in the comments have you tried
anything has this been like your brand
forever and you're just now wondering
why more people are talking about it let
us know in the comments down below or
let us know if you're going to give this
one a world in 2017 so the next friend I
want to talk about is another one that I
mentioned all of the time I wasn't sure
if I was going to put it in here because
like I said I was trying to do some
brands so I thought maybe weren't as
well-known or you know kind of
underrated brands but honestly sometimes
I kind of feel this way with a sigma
beauty I love Sigma beauty I've been
purchasing from them for so long way
before my YouTube days I think this is
my very first high-end makeup brushes
that I started buying and I've done a
sigma beauty makeup collection and from
the comments and there are so many
people again I've never heard of Sigma
Beauty I've never tried anything from
sequin beauty oh I need to make a
purchase from Sigma Beauty I've never
have so that's kind of why I decided to
include it and again just because it's
one of my favorite brands one that I'm
constantly recommending and one that I
just have a huge collection the Sigma
brushes are definitely what I gravitate
towards but a couple of their makeup
items that I really loved one is their
blushes I know I mentioned this in an
underrated makeup video because I feel
like no one talked about the Sigma
blushes and they are freaking really
and so on I feel like this gives a more
recognition than the blush but the gel
Elena from Sigma I have mine in wicket
which is the black and it's freakin
awesome a really good job I know really
easy to work with really black and I
just love it but definitely what I love
the most from it Sigma is their brushes
this is like a seventh of my collection
because I have so many Sigma brushes I
love makeup brushes I have like a weird
obsession with buying them is by far my
favorite favorite brush brand if you are
looking for good brushes and good
quality makeup brushes I highly
recommend it Sigma I do have a full
Sigma collection video as well so I'll
leave that link down below because I go
through each of the brushes and let you
know what I think about them and what I
use them for but they are awesome I am a
Sigma affiliate I cried like a baby the
day that they asked me to be an
affiliate with them because like I said
one of the first high-end brands that I
was purchasing from my first high-end
brushes that I was purchasing from and
then for it to come it was almost like
full circle you know and because Sigma
was my first big brand affiliation that
was offered to me and you know to have
it be come full circle like that like
really meant so much to me like why but
really I just meant a lot to me and it
was like a big deal for yourself I am a
Sigma affiliate but again that's not the
only reason why I reckon Mondays because
I've been recommending them way before I
did my Sigma collection video before I
wasn't affiliated with them so that has
no bearing to it but I do have a code
with them it's just Samantha and get 10%
off your order
I'm always recommending their brushes
let us know in the comments down below
what you have from Sigma are you still
hoping to make a purchase from them in
2017 let us know in the comments okay I
have two more brands that love to talk
about the next one that I want to talk
about is hooter beauty another one I
kind of back and forth on because like I
kind of feel like hooter Beauty does get
a lot of hype like she has like
completely pop in Instagram and I know a
lot of people really love following her
over there but even with that being said
the reason why I decided to include it
is I didn't totally buy into it right
away and so
I finally did I was like oh man like I
totally should have done this sooner so
that's why I wanted to put in this video
because it is just a brand that I
definitely would recommend I also think
it's really amazing that who did is
super boss and I always love to support
some girl bosses so what I tried out
from her first was her lashes there we
go
were the lashes these are the hooter
lashes and Samantha and they are amazing
I can find two in a beauty at Sephora so
more recently I was able to try out her
liquid lipsticks and they are phenomenal
so now I know I have the shades
trendsetter and bombshell bombshell is
actually still in my clutch from my
friend's wedding because it is what I
wore during the wedding and I haven't
cleaned that out yet because I'm kind of
lazy that way but I love these liquid
lipsticks I mentioned them in my top 5
best and worst lipsticks and these one
in the best because they are amazing and
I wore these on my friend's wedding
I applied bombshell which is a really
pretty nude pink I applied it at 3:30 at
2:30 a.m. my lipstick look great I did
not touch up one not one time these are
minis because I bought them in a little
contour set and came with two mini
liquid lipsticks when I'm buying more
full sizes because I think they are that
good definitely recommend to into Beauty
both for the eyelashes and the lipsticks
okay the last brand I want to talk about
I went back and forth with so many
brands because I wanted to mention a
brand that I put in my 7 brands I want
to try in 2017 I really wanted to talk
about a brand instead I put in that
video and kind of like do a little
follow-up from that one and I had a
couple different brains in there that I
mentioned that I have tried in 2017 but
the one that I had to give it to is a
violent boss now I've only tried one
thing from violet sauce and this is it
is the Holy Grail
I shadow palette and I really wanted to
include it because I really do feel that
strongly about this palette a huge thank
you to my beautiful friend Michelle who
sent this to me she watched the 7 brains
I want to buy in 2017 and she ended up
getting this for me and I was so
thankful because I'm not sure I'm proof
I'm pretty sure I would have purchased
from them but it might have not been
supersu and so for her to get this to me
and completely sell me on violent boss
I'm just so thankful for so huge thank
you to Michelle this palette is
beautiful like I said it's the Holy
Grail pal
and these eyeshadows I've always heard
really good things about the violet box
i shadow formula and so that's why I
want to buy it that's why I mentioned it
in my previous video but it's gorgeous
it has the strength mirror band
yeah the Holy Grail palette I've been
obsessed with it so I would definitely
want to try more from by lipof in 2017
but if you've been eyeing this brand
like I was I want to tell you guys that
I think you should go ahead and make a
purchase especially on my eyeshadow
palettes because that's really what what
I can only recommend right now but the
Holy Grail palette is absolutely
beautiful really happy I got it let me
know in the comments down below what do
you have from violet sauce or what are
you hoping to get from violet boss or
are you hoping the 2017 is the year that
you do purchase from violet sauce I've
been so happy with my palette I guess
that's going to be everything for my
seven brands I think you should try in
2017 I really hope that you guys enjoyed
this video maybe a little bit something
different but again the seven brands I
want to try and 2017 videos seem to go
over really well so that I can do a
little spin on that one and just
recommend some of my favorite brands and
some of my favorite products to you I
know if you guys follow me on other
social media outlets you probably see me
using these products all the time so you
know that I really am like ride or die
for a lot of these and they're just
products that I love recommending and I
love using so I hope that you guys
enjoyed this video or found it helpful
in some way leave me some comments down
