today's video is going to be 7 of my
most disappointing makeup products that
I tried in 2017 all the way so last week
I posted my top 17 favorite makeup
products in 2017 and in that video there
was a lot of comments that came in
asking me to do it on the flip side when
I talk about my most disappointing my
least favorite from 2017 not only were
there a lot of those comments but a lot
of those comments also got a ton of
thumbs up so I knew a lot of people
wanted to see this video and at first I
kind of questioned it because I didn't
want to make this too negative I don't
really like putting out super negative
videos at the end of the day we do have
to remember that it's just makeup and
it's just not possible for one makeup
product to work for everybody I don't
feel like there's anything wrong with
makeup not working out for someone
because it just is the reality of buying
makeup so I was like you know what I
still I'm gonna do this video I know a
lot of you wanted to see it and I always
appreciate video suggestions as well so
that's what we're gonna do today I'm
going into pic 7 I didn't want to do 17
I thought that was too many but I chose
7 of my most disappointing my least
favorite makeup products that I tried
throughout 2017 so if you are ready to
see those products why don't we go ahead
and get started so first of all talk
about to a makeup products that I did
end up returning I was going through
like my makeup monthly throughout the
year and some of my other videos where I
knew as reviewing products and I made a
list of them I have two eyes shadow
pellets that I returned because I just
did not think that they were good
quality especially for the price so the
first eyeshadow palette I'm going to
talk about is the Urban Decay Naked heat
this was $54 eye shadow palette I
believe I purchased mine from Sephora
and I was just so bummed about it I was
so excited for this palette and I felt
like it was getting a ton of hype before
it released I purchased it right after
it released and I was so excited for it
and I ended up being incredibly
disappointed I guess that I did return
it so I'll have a photo of it up on the
screen but there was a couple of things
that didn't work out for me one I wasn't
like blown away by the formula and I was
actually pretty disappointed in the
shimmers I remember really having to
work with the shimmers you know have my
brush to make the shimmers work they
just they just were not working out for
me I remember thinking that the mattes
were okay but again it wasn't like a
formula that was absolutely blowing me
away
and I also thought that there's too many
similar colors than there um you know
the eyeshadow palette doesn't have an
overwhelming amount of shadows in there
so when there was like a handful of
shadows that seemed so so I learned two
other shadows in the palette I was kind
of like what why did they do that
I wish there would have been a larger
shade selection even for such a
monochromatic palette I still thought
there should have been a better shade
selection in there and then especially
for purchasing it for the $54 I was like
this is just not worth it to me I don't
think it helped that the Jacqueline Hill
palette from morphe released at that
same time and it had a lot of similar
shades to the Urban Decay Naked Heat and
I that's one of my favorite palettes
that was mentioned in the top 17 in 2017
so I was like I just I can't justify
keeping the $54 eye shadow palette when
I'm just not as impressed with it so I
didn't end up returning the Urban Decay
Naked Heat I know a lot of people really
love that palette so you know it's
everything makeup wise is such a
personal preference and for me we just
weren't able to buy them the other
palette that I returned in 2017 it has a
bit more recent than naked heat this one
was the NYX Cosmetics in your elements
eyes shadow palette and I picked mine up
and fire these were a fairly recent
release and NYX Cosmetics released in
your elements collection I think it was
cuz I think they also have lipsticks and
eyeliners with it but they also had like
six or seven different eyeshadow
palettes and there was like fire and
earth and wind and all of that and I
picked up the fire palette because it
had like a red in there and yellow and
these oranges you know the colors that
we think of when we say a fire palette
and I was pumped up man and then NYX
released the prices on the palettes and
there were thirty dollars for a NYX
eyeshadow palette and I was like this
expensive NYX what are you doing to us
but I really truly thought if NYX is
gonna be putting out thirty dollar
eyeshadow palettes that they were gonna
be you know really confident in those
palettes like they're really going to be
worth it I mean we are definitely
noticing
that drugstore prices are rising and
rising and rising I mean $30 for a NYX
eyeshadow pellet when you can purchase
Anastasio for 42 that's pretty wild to
me but I was like hopefully they you
know they're really seeing it behind
their palettes and I just could not get
on with it
I did try that out in a first
impressions type of video and the
comments that you guys were leaving like
it hurt my eyes watching you trying to
pull and those eyeshadow no it was I
remember was one comment that stuck out
to me I was like I know and I kept
having to switch brushes in the video I
was like I was gonna try this other
version
oh my god this other brush I don't have
to do that for eyeshadow palettes they
weren't very pigmented they did not
blend well it just was an overall it was
a pretty big fail for me especially for
being a $30 I purchased mine from Ulta
and I took it right back because I was
like nope I I cannot I cannot justify
this at all and I just did not like that
eyeshadow palette so unfortunately the
NYX fire palette was a no-go for me so I
do have a couple different enough
foundations here that did not work out
for me definitely I feel like I don't
even know one it would have been like
kind of early 2017 early to mid 2017 i
all of a sudden got on a foundation kick
I wanted to try all of these different
foundations from all these different
brands I mean I still and I'm I'm loving
trying out different foundations but I
have found that not every foundation
works out for me of course so I had a
handful of foundations here to talk
about but one is the Tarte clay stick
foundation I was so bummed so bummed
that I did not like this because this
also was getting a ton of hype at the
time I remember I purchased this along
with the clay play palette which I think
again I mentioned in the top 17 a 20-17
I purchased those at the same time and
like I love the clay play and this was
like such a fail for me I was super
bummed about it I did a foundation
declutter recently and I did declare
this guy says in my declutter pill I
have it up for sale like on my blog
sailing things like that because I did
purchase this myself from the Tarte
website and I purchased it like right
when it came out too because I heard
just from the Tarte website it hadn't
even hit so far I'll tell ya that's how
excited I was about both this and the
clay play pellet I was so disappointed
when it didn't work for me one of the
biggest problems was that the shade
wasn't right for me it's in a light
medium neutral and it's just too light
of a shade for
unfortunately but also I didn't like the
coverage I felt like it was super super
light coverage for me personally my
preference is medium if it's really full
coverage I tend not to like it if it's
really light coverage I tend not to like
it and this one was just way too light
for me and I felt like I was having to
use a ton of product when I put this a
stick foundation on I mean I have to
cover my entire face with a very thick
layer for it to look like I have some
sort of foundation and it's trying to
even out my skin like it just it was
just not working out for me so yes the
shade didn't match me but I also didn't
love the coverage and I didn't think it
did anything for my skin I didn't think
it made my skin look better I didn't
think it made it look healthy it didn't
it was just gonna do anything for my
skin it just kind of sat there it's just
that foundation that's sits there on
your face that's it so unfortunately the
Tarte clay stick foundation oh this was
a disappointment in 2017 another
foundation this list should come as no
surprise this also got the clutter in my
foundation declutter video this is from
Estee Lauder it's the double wear nude
water fresh foundation I don't know what
it is that has made me so mad at this
foundation but something about this
foundation just has made me angry I feel
like I got hyped for this foundation
because the original Estee Lauder Double
Wear is like such a loved foundation and
everybody always raves about it I never
personally went for it myself because
everybody would also say how full
coverage of this and I'm like well it's
like a love full coverage at probably a
bad decision to get it but when they
came out with the water fresh makeup it
wasn't supposed to be asked full
coverage you know water foundation is
typically more liquidy and all that so I
was like okay maybe I'd still be able to
breathe I don't like feeling like I
don't like I don't I don't like feeling
like you can't see my skin and type of
thing so when I saw the water fresh
foundation I was like okay I'm gonna go
for it and first of all it was a $42
foundation and it didn't come up with
this nice pump I had a lovely subscriber
ended up sending me a Mac puff because
in the video where I was trying it I was
like what in the heck it doesn't even
come with a pump and it's 42 dollars
like drugstore foundations that come
with a pump
the problem is it's because it's such a
liquidy foundation when you try to pour
it out it makes a huge mess so that was
one thing I was like everything else
about it is really nice like the glass
bottle the frosted glass bottle like
everything looks so good on it and then
you open it up and you have to dump it
out everywhere I'm like oh man and I'm
not someone who likes putting makeup on
their fingers because I know a lot of
people are like just kind of casually
put your finger in there and then doubt
it on your face I don't know why this is
the thing for me but I don't like
putting makeup on my fingers okay don't
like swatching I don't know what it is
it's just something weird about me that
I've learned since starting a YouTube
channel honestly so I was I was bummed
about the high price and then having to
do with the pump on top of them because
she sent along a Mack pump which is
twelve dollars so now we're talking high
50s for this foundation so I'm like
first of all that's just a lot of money
in general for a foundation that's a lot
for for me to spend I know I personally
didn't purchase the pump myself but if I
were to have kept this foundation I
think I would have purchased the pump
myself because I just sent like the mess
that I was making with this but then at
the same time I just didn't love the way
it looked on my skin I think because it
was so liquidy it was just kind of like
leaving streaks no matter if I use a
beauty blender or a brush or what it was
I felt like my skin look streaky after I
use this and it it would make me
self-conscious like if I use this before
I went on camera I was constantly
reaching over and grabbing my mirror and
looking and having the brush next to me
and making sure I was I didn't have
streaks on my face so it definitely made
me self-conscious and you don't want
that in a foundation of course so I
didn't love the way that it looked on my
skin so overall it was just it was a
really big bummer to me I wish I would
have returned this I don't know why I
did I think it was because when I did my
first impression and I wasn't super
stoked with us a lot of people were you
know giving me advice or feedback or a
lot of people were like this is my
favorite foundation I'm like okay I'm
gonna make it work and it didn't make it
work so I should have returned this one
I did declutter it I think it is for
sale on my blog sale because I did
I can't purchase it myself so I don't
know maybe someone else will want it and
they'll give it a loving home but for me
we had to part ways another foundation
the last foundation that I have
is from a pure cosmetic so this is the
barielle foundation I think this one and
then also the Tarte clay stick
foundation I did a video of my least
favorite products from my favorite brand
and I think these two over the products
that I mentioned a for Tarte and then
also appear two of my favorite brands
but sometimes it just happens I mean
that every single brand is going to
release everything that you absolutely
love and it's another reason why I tried
to get over that whole like should I
make this video is it going to be too
negative
but I mean of course makeup simply can't
work for every single person across the
board it's just not possible so the pure
of bear doll foundation oh so pump it
didn't work out for me this was sent to
me in PR job so grateful for it is a $39
foundation so it is pretty pricey it
says it's a 12 hour foreign one skin
perfecting a foundation I think the
problem that I had with this one is it
was so incredibly thick it is a squeeze
to form and I remember the first time I
squeeze them out onto like my brush and
read Beauty Blender and it came out in
like a very thick collab and I just kind
of looked at it like oh okay then it's a
little bit harder to blend out on to my
skin and I felt like it never quite just
blend it in right I kind of feel like I
did the same thing as the Tarte one
where I just kind of sat on top of the
skin it didn't make any improvements to
my face it didn't it really didn't even
like even anything out because sometimes
I just wear foundation because I have
like some uneven patches around my face
a foundation kinda helps even everything
out and make it look nicer and I don't I
don't feel like my skin look nice with
this at all and again it's another
foundation that made me feel
self-conscious the times that I would
wear it because you know I did wear it
out several times so I could test it out
to review it and unfortunately it just
did not work out for me I was so bummed
I really do like a lot of items from
Pierre but unfortunately the paradol
foundation was a big miss for me morphe
and it is their concealers these little
concealers I think they have another
concealer too but in this packaging this
is the concealer that I did not love I
actually did get sent a couple of the
concealers in a PR package from morphe
which wasn't so awesome I was very
excited to try them but I had known
going into that that I have seen less
than stellar reviews
the morphe concealer but I'm like don't
put it put it aside put it aside you
test it out for yourself because like I
said you know some things I love and
other people don't love and vice versa I
know my friends live and Kaleigh just
did some collab videos on products they
love that other people hate and then
products they hate that other people
love if you guys like that video idea if
you'd want to see one for me do let me
know in the comments I find this one
interesting what works for some people
and what doesn't work for other people
but knowing that I was like going to it
with an open mind you know you have to
give your fair shot because this could
end up being a product that you really
love and unfortunately I'm so pumped I
was so bummed it it did not work out for
me the thing that I noticed about the
morphe concealer is that it's very
drying when I applied this I realized
after the first time that I used it when
I applied concealer I typically put it
on when under eye the other under-eye
and then from highlighting in the center
of my face I put it on my forehead my
nose my Cupid's bow and my chance
basically with a straight line down your
face I would blend out one eye and by
the time I got to the other eye the
concealer would be dry and it would just
be stuck there and I'm like oh what's
going on here
and I realized it was best to use this
with a damp Beauty Blender to kind of
try to give it a little bit more like
hydration to the concealer but
unfortunately not only did it dry
quickly so even if I apply it to one
under eye and blended it out then apply
to the under eye and blended it out it
still was just so very dry that it would
just it would look kind of like crepey
on my under eyes I'm someone who
struggles with dry under eyes especially
bad in the winter as the cold weather is
coming up I'm already like completely
stocked up on like under eye patches and
under eye gels under eye creams
everything because I know that I can get
dry patches but even during the summer
and the warmer weather I can still deal
with dry under eyes and if I use a
concealer that's too drying
it's just a mess under there it does not
look cute it's just not good so
unfortunately that's is what I realized
what the morphe concealers so these were
a big mess for me in 2017 and then the
last items that I have to talk about are
a lipstick I actually kind of forgot
about this one until I was going back
and watching my makeup monthlies and I
want to say this was from like the month
of March
I think it
and I was like oh my gosh how did I
forget about those these are a liquid
lipsticks from wet in a while oh man and
I was so bummed about these I'll insert
some photos of what they look like
because I don't have any more in my
possession even though I purchased like
four or five different colors because
everybody started raving about the wet
and wild liquid catsuit liquid lipsticks
and I was like I definitely need to get
these I went to like my CVS and they
didn't have any there I went to my
Walgreens and I don't even like
Walgreens like I started boycotting Weld
means like years ago because of bad
situations that happened there and I was
going while the goons trying to find
these lipsticks because I was like
everybody's talking about them Mitch and
I went out of town to his hometown and I
was like can we stop by the Walgreens I
need to see if they have these lipsticks
like that is how much people were hyping
in them up and I was like I need to get
them and I was so disappointed and I was
so bummed now they are only like four or
five dollars because it's wet in wild
who actually is keeping affordability at
the drugstore level which is great so
they're very inexpensive but still I
bought like five of them so I mean if I
still spend one for twenty dollars
trying to make these liquid lipsticks
works cuz I was like it must just be
this color
I'll just buy a different color and then
that one will probably work better I
mean I bought like the lightest beige I
bought a red I bought like the mob I
bought the nude I'm like what am I doing
wrong here to me they were so drying
like incredibly incredibly drying and I
love liquid lipsticks I tried a lot of
liquid lipstick formulas but that one
was one of the most drying ones it was
uncomfortable on the lips but they
didn't stay on me the first time I
filmed with those on I applied it right
before I get on camera like I normally
do I filmed for 20-30 minutes whatever
it takes for me to film a video by the
time I got done it was completely worn
away in the center of my lip it looked
so unattractive I was like and all those
doing was talking I wasn't eating I
didn't drink anything I'm just sitting
here talking and the lipstick wore away
so quickly so I tried so many different
shades I really wanted to make these
work I wanted to find that affordable
drugstore a liquid lipstick that I
absolutely love and you know would the
NYX liquid suede like what I have on
today I put on my saucy lipstick today
since we're talking about makeup we
don't like this is and I believe
Stone Fox from Nicks I love the NYX
liquid suede the soft matte lip creams I
mean there's good affordable drugstore
liquid lipsticks and lipsticks out there
but the wet and wild ones they did not
make the cut for me I guess with us
going everything for my seven
disappointing makeup products of 2017 I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video our phone a helpful or
entertaining in some way again of course
you know probably a bit more of a
negative video but it's just makeup at
the end of the day and not everything is
going to work for everybody so always
keep that in mind I'm sure I probably
mentioned something that is a favorite
of yours and just don't hold it against
me they didn't work out for me okay but
thank you guys so much for watching if
you do have any other video suggestions
