today's video is going to be all about
eight brands of that I want to try in
the year 2018 I did a similar video to
this I believe it was in the summer it
was seven brands that I want to try in
2017
I recently also did my follow-up to that
talking about the brands that I was able
to try this year so I will have both of
those videos linked down below if you're
interested but I thought since we are
approaching a new year which is crazy
that I could do eight brands of that I
want to try in 2018 so if you'd like to
see those brands why don't we go ahead
and get started
all right so jumping into it the first
brand that I would have mentioned is
coloured raine I kind of can't believe
that I have not tried color grain yet
and I feel like I'm one of the few that
hasn't colored grain has some amazing
eyeshadow palettes the Queen of Hearts
is definitely like the most in my
opinion the most well-known eyeshadow
palette from them they were having some
really amazing a black friday cyber
monday deals and unfortunately the Queen
of Hearts sold out right away and I was
like oh they also just released some
mini eyeshadow palettes and I actually
am really considering purchasing those
two they're only six pantai shadow
palettes there are $36 and at the time
that I'm filming they're on sale for
like $27 I think which is still pretty
pricy for six pans but I really want to
try their eyeshadows and I hear really
amazing things about their eyeshadow
palettes so I'm still looking at that
one like oh should I do it or should I
just like for the Queen of Hearts like I
don't I don't know what I should do let
me let me know what you think do you
guys have the little pallets from color
drained you suggest I just wait for the
Queen of Hearts Sunday's days I will be
getting that Queen of Hearts pallet it
but definitely coloured raine I just
feel like I hear really good things
about them really good things about
their makeup the quality of their makeup
and all of that so coloured raine I'm I
and you I'm coming for you in 2018
another brand that I really want to try
in 2018 I'm sure I'm gonna say it wrong
but it is Zhu Ava Beauty I've heard it
pronounced many different ways I've
heard it's a way of a beauty I've heard
Zuma Beauty so I'm not 100% sure myself
but I have really been eyeing this brand
and I almost purchased an eyeshadow
palette from them a couple months ago
and then I think it was something what
the shipping that freaked me out I think
they had really high shipping cost and I
was like
for shipping why I know no I'm at my
post office almost every single day
shipping out packages and that's
expensive but for some reason I always
want free shipping I don't know what it
is
look I definitely hear a lot about their
eyeshadow palettes I get tagged on them
a lot for my will I buy up videos
especially I always see a couple tags
coming in on their eyeshadow palettes so
I have been curious about them but I
would love to know have you guys tried
the way of a beauty what do you think
about them what do you think about their
eyeshadow palettes what else would you
recommend from the brand just let me
know some of your experiences that's why
I really liked doing this video for the
7 and 2017 as well because it's really
nice to be able to get feedback you know
not only on like you know the shipping
in the customer service and the quality
and all of that I really I mean you guys
know that I read every single one of my
comments I typically respond - I'm gonna
say 99.5% of my comments and usually if
I don't respond you didn't have
something nice to say so I don't have
something nice to say back but I
difficulty respond to every single
comment as well and I just feel like
they're so helpful so I would love to
know if anyone has purchased from so I
have a beauty what you would recommend
maybe what you wouldn't recommend you
know anything like that but yes
definitely I am them for 2018 Brayan
then I really want to try and I'm kind
of surprised that I haven't yet to be
honest is best damn Beauty best damn
Beauty was started by Nicole Guerrero
who is a very like og youtuber here I
think she has close to 3 million YouTube
subscribers she was one of the first
that I've ever started watching I love
her tutorials her blogs lately have been
absolutely killing me I think she's just
so down to earth and so relatable and I
really enjoy watching her but honestly
it wasn't until like a few months into
watching her videos that she made a
comment about best damn beauty and I
remember thinking was funny cuz she's
like gonna put on my best damn lip mask
and I was like I know that's funny like
she really likes that lip mask and then
I realized that was actual name of it
best damn Beauty best amulet mask I was
like oh I get it now I was I thought
that she just meant my damn let that old
but that I was like what what and when
she finally mentioned that you know she
owns bus-stand beauty and she started it
she has this line I was like how come
I've been watching this girl for months
and I had no idea but honestly so now
it's been you know 2 3 years since I've
been watching
and I really don't hear her mention her
brand a whole ton which is really
surprising to me because I I mean I feel
like you know we definitely live in a
world where we're always you know self
promoting ourselves and shameless
self-promotion I mean heck I did the
same thing I will publish out there give
by my books but I mean I feel like we're
always mentioning things like that and I
don't think it's a bad thing and I
almost wish that Nicole would do it more
to let more people know and because like
I said I was watching her for months I
had no idea I would love to know if you
guys knew that she had the best damn
beauty of course all the brains that I'm
mentioning will be linked down below but
best damn beauty looks to be mostly
focused on skincare and I felt skin care
so I'm definitely interested I do want
to try the best damn lip mask I think
that's like one of their bestsellers and
when I I do follow busting Beauty on
Instagram as well so I'll have that link
down there too and I always see people
commenting about how much they love the
lip mask but they have like cleansers
and serums and moisturizers and all of
that I would love to try I love skincare
and I just really love Nicole and I'd
like to be able to support him that way
but if you guys didn't know that she has
her own brand best and beauty I would
say definitely check them out and I'm
going to I'm going to make purchase in
2018 so another brand that has recently
gotten my attention is called bold face
makeup I found them through Nicole Renee
Cutler another youtuber here she has
been really raping about their lashes
I've seen that on like her snapchat and
I've seen and her videos as well I think
she had an Instagram post the other day
wearing the lashes and I love lashes I
love wearing lashes I love finding new
styles and brands of lashes I love it
all give me all the lashes please and I
looked them up after she was talking
about them and it looks like right now
they only have lashes they have two
different collections the bold
collection and then also the glam
collection and they have quite a few
different sets of lashes underneath that
the lashes look to be about 875 so nine
dollars for lashes which I don't think
that's a bad price if you watched my
video was at yesterday's video about
makeup I won't pay full price for I mean
we're talking about twenty twenty three
twenty five dollar lashes in there so
when I see nine dollars I'm like nine
dollar lashes please continue I really
do want to try them out I'm always
looking for new brands and again like I
said
Mama's looking for new lashes to fall in
love with so full face makeup I'm gonna
get some of their lashes so another
brand that I've recently like very
recently starting to hear more and more
about it's a new brand is called Lala's
beauty and I believe it was I love Sarah
II I saw her do a video about the liquid
lipsticks and then jackie ina did a
video pretty recently about women owned
makeup brands and she did a full face
using bunch of women on brands which I
thought was a super cool video by the
way and she mentioned the salaat less
beauty in there and I was like okay I
remember I saw that in a video before I
need to I need to actually go scope this
out now so the brand was started by
Annie lawless who really into like a
healthy lifestyle and things like that
and the slogan of the brand is natural
AF which I find hysterical and right now
she has liquid lipsticks out it looks
like that's all that she has at this
time and you can get them at lawless
beauty and then I also found him at
Neiman Marcus I'm not sure if there's
anywhere else that you can get them but
those are the two places that popped up
when I was doing the search for them so
she has these different liquid lipsticks
and it's really funny because each the
lipstick is a name of a guy which I just
thought was sister so she has like Ryan
Leo Brad George has a bunch of liquid
lipsticks all the different guys name on
there though that lipsticks are $25
apiece which is pretty expensive for a
liquid lipsticks I am really eyeing them
I've just really intrigued you know we
always have these new brands popping up
all the time and it's really fun to find
them and you know just to kind of like
switch it up and you know have some
fresh makeup and your makeup collection
and all of that so lawless Beauty got my
eyes on them has anybody tried that they
look what lipsticks yet what do you
think have you heard of lawless Beauty I
would love to know but hopefully 2018
I'll be trying out lawless beauty so
another brand that I feel like might be
kind of funny is that I haven't tried
anything from them because they're a
pretty big brand and my hair a lot of
people talk about them but you a
cosmetics I am fairly confident that I
have not tried anything from them I went
through my collection looking for items
I found a little sample of a lip mask
but it's never even been opened I think
it came in like a maybe like an Ipsy bag
or it was like a sample you know I get a
sample with your like Sephora Nell to
order it's never been opened and I've
never tried it out and I was trying it
so hard to think have I ever tried
anything from g'way and I'm
they sure but that is a no and I feel
like they're very hyped up brand they
work with a lot of different you know
social media influencers a ton of people
have you a discount codes but I have
never tried anything from them and I
don't know why I know I've mentioned
them and will I buy at videos and I've
always said like I just don't really
gravitate towards them I don't have a
good reason and I'm not saying anything
bad about that like the brand turns me
off or anything it's just I don't know
what it is I just have never made a
purchase from them I hear great things
about their lipsticks there are lip
toppers I know they had an eyeshadow
palette fairly recently that people seem
to really enjoy but I don't know I don't
know what's wrong with me I don't know
why I haven't done it what's your
favorite items from ziwei no I'm kind of
embarrassed to say it but I mean it's
it's the truth bad but I want to I want
to try anyway 2018 it's gonna be my year
I'm gonna put that embarrassment behind
me and I'm gonna try out anyway so
another brand that I've never tried
anything from but I am super curious
about them is Besame at cosmetics I feel
like I've been hearing more and more
lately about Besame cosmetics they are
coming out with a snow-white
collection and best mate is they kind of
have like that very like vintage vibe of
vintage feel about them and their makeup
products which i think is super cool
some of the items from Besame are also
sold at Sephora I found the cake mascara
there and I want to say maybe it was
like Rachel loves who did a video like
last year using it or something really
similar to this kind of cake mascara I
remember seeing it go around on social
media like wait what what is this I
would check it out if you haven't seen
it yet they have a few items at Sephora
I know I don't think everything from
best mate goes to Sephora but then I
also do have their website so of course
I will all be listed down below but I
love kind of like the vintage feel the
vintage style of things I think it's
really super cool so I've been
interested in them in a while I remember
looking at the Snow White Collection and
I can't remember if I put it in a will I
buy a veil or not but I remember getting
tight and I looked very closely at it
but it seemed a little bit like just too
out of my price range for the bow but
sometimes it's hard when you've never
tried a brand to buy something from them
that is pretty pricey like with coloured
raine the first brand I was talking
about the Queen of Hearts eyeshadow
palette I believe is $50 that's kind of
a lot to spend when you're first trying
a brain and you don't know anything
about them you don't know how the
shipping is gonna be or you know
anything about
customer service and you don't know
about the quality it's just kind of hard
to just go all in and spend a lot of
money right away and that's kind of
where I am what's best make cosmetics
but I know it's something I need to get
over it I need to try out new brands you
know I really enjoy doing that and find
the new brands and talking about new
brands for my channel and things like
that so 2018 you're gonna try me some
best make cosmetics alrighty and then
the eighth and final brain hopefully
safe sometimes when I do these list
things around like ten fifteen eight
products I'm so paranoid then I'm going
to be wrong and only have like seven or
nine but I believe this is the eighth
and final braid that I want to try in
2018 this is another really big brand
that I always hear people talking about
and people using and I've never tried
anything and it is Laura Geller I've
never tried anything from Laura Geller
nothing nothing at all and there has
been so many times right for an Ulta and
I am holding her highlights holding them
in my tiny baby hands and I'm like I'm
getting you and by the time I check out
I don't have the highlight in my hand
anymore
I'm like should I put that bag I just
I've never done it and I feel like the
brand maybe isn't as hyped as it is now
as when I first started watching YouTube
because especially everybody was using
Laura Geller Gilda honey Laura Geller
Gilda Gilda honey Gilda honey and that's
always what I had in my hand when I went
to Ulta there was even times when I went
to Alda and Gilda honey was sold out I
mean it was crazy but for some reason I
have just never been able to complete
the purchase
I think the highlights are like 24 or 26
dollars for one highlight and that is
very expensive that's very expensive for
one highlight that's typically too much
money that Samantha wants to pay for one
highlight but I've done it before I can
do it again but even when there's been
like sales or discounts I've never taken
advantage of it and I don't know why so
she has a whole range of I mean a ton of
different items I feel like I hear good
things about her blush too so I just I
really want to try I feel like I've been
putting off a laura geller for far too
long I feel like I'm not part of the
in-crowd but I've never seen what I
could look like with Gilda honey on my
cheekbones and I really want to change
that so let me know have you guys tried
laura geller or what are some of your
favorite products
again where maybe some of your least
favorite products that you wouldn't
recommend or are you like me and you
haven't tried the brain jet either I
would love to know but after that that's
gonna do it for eight brands I want to
try in 2018 okay so that's gonna do it
for this video I really hope that you
enjoyed that seeing the apron so that I
wanted to try it in 2018 and I would
love to know of course is some of your
brands which ones you want to try which
ones are you like I can't believe I
haven't tried anything from this brain
yet or what are some newer brains I hope
maybe I mentioned a few brands that you
know our newer or maybe not as well
known and you know maybe now more people
will know about them hopefully that
would be cool but I would love to know
your comments down below
I believe I did last year to seven
brands I think you should try in 2017 if
you would want to see one of those for
me as well eight brands I think you
should try in 2018 either brands that I
think are like underrated or indie
brands or just brands that you know
maybe I found recently but I really love
and I think that they should be getting
more attention let me know because I
could definitely do that video as well
and I hope that you guys enjoyed this
video and of course if you did I hope
that you will give it a thumbs up I hope
that you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I will catch you guys
in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
