today's video is going to be eight
brands I think you should try it in 2018
I recently did my eight brands I want to
try in 2018 talking about some brands
that I have never tried before but
they're on my radar for 2018 and I asked
if you would like to see also a
recommendations video of brands that I
enjoy and then I would recommend for you
to try out if you haven't yet and a lot
of people said yes I did do these videos
a for 2017 I did the seven brands I want
to try seven brands I think you should
try and I also did my seven brands
follow-up video talking about all the
brands from my original list that I did
trying 2017 so all of those will be
linked down below but if you would like
to see the eight brands I think you
should try in 2018 why don't we go ahead
and get started so I'm gonna do is
really similar to the seven brands I
think you should try in 2017 I'm going
to be talking about brands that maybe I
think are underrated or have underrated
makeup products I might have some indie
brands on my list and things like that
or some of them as well our brands that
I have recently tried a few things from
but I want to try even more from so
that's like kind of a list for me to I
couldn't quite include them in my eight
brains I want to try because technically
I've tried them but I need try more from
them
so the first brand I want to touch on is
in Indy brand I mentioned her quite a
bit but it's been a brand that I have
been loving for over a year now and have
tried quite a few of her products this
is Chris Anna and cosmetics so I do have
a couple of items here that I would
recommend I'm gonna go into my Z palette
here these are five shades up here the
purple blue green pink and gold those
are all single shadows from Christina
and cosmetics and I love them I love
them so much they are seven dollars
apiece for the single shadows and I
think they are absolutely beautiful the
very first product I ever tried from
Christina and cosmetics was her matte
liquid lipsticks I believe these are ten
dollars apiece she also does have
metallic liquid lips and I'm not a big
metallic lipstick lover and one I did a
lipstick declutter you know a few months
back for whatever it was I declared most
of my metallic lips but I kept the one
from Chris Anna and cuz this one was my
favorite so she also has some really
nice liquid lips I just pulled out these
two in goals AF and turns and these are
ten dollars and I just recently started
trying out her brow pomade she just
released this as a new product I haven't
buying it out so I can get a review up
and coming for it but so far so good and
I am NOT a brow pomade gal it kind of
scares me a little bit but you can see
that I have been trying it out because I
want to see if I can and get the hang of
it and how it works out but if you like
brow pomade I bet that you would like
this one - like I said Kristina and is
an indie brand and I think it's really
fun to support I definitely want to do a
video coming up on my favorite items
from indie brands as well I have been
working with Kristina and cosmetics like
I said I've tried out her products at
least over a year ago I can remember
taking our family Christmas card photo
last year and I was wearing I think it
was turned in the Christmas photo that
we took and then we took that last year
November so I've been trying out her
products for a really long time and
recently she did offer me a discount
code as well and I accepted it because I
have been trying out her products I do
recommend them I featured them a lot in
videos and I wear them a lot as well so
if you'd be interested in trying
anything from Kristina and like I'm
recommending you do in the year 2018
you can save 15% on her entire website
with the code March Beauty she has a
brand that I would definitely recommend
of course I will have the website listed
down below and I will also link her
Instagram over there and so another
brand I mentioned is one of those that I
recently started trying but now they're
on my radar and I do want to trade more
of their products I feel like this is
probably an underrated brand because I
really don't hear a lot of people
chatting about them but I wanted to go
ahead and give them a recommendation and
this is julep beauty so I recently did
get sent a few products over from julep
beauty and I really have been enjoying
them this primer actually I really
really enjoyed I did put it in my most
recent Beauty newsletter as well because
I was just like I want to spread the
word more about this primer but just
funny for me because I'm not a big
primer person but I really enjoyed this
primer this is there a mattifying a
treatment primer it's like my go-to
primer I always have it sitting out and
it's just one that I've been using a lot
recently I also have been trying out the
5 in one skin Perfector cushion
complexion a foundation I actually use
it they say you can use it for a bunch
of different things and I use the shade
sand for foundation and then I also use
the shade linen as a
for my under eyes and I think it works
really well for both I just do a lighter
hand for the concealer and then with the
foundation you know I make sure to cover
my full face but this is what the
foundation looks like you can see it's
been it's been loved several times I've
used it quite often but I really like it
you just kind of twisted up in the
product it comes out so the foundation
is one to check out too but one product
that has definitely caught my attention
and I have been trying more and more I
don't wear powders every day but I've
been finding myself reaching for this
powder because I think it just gives a
really nice finish to the skin this is
called their insta filter invisible
finishing powder so it looks like this
and then inside you have a nice little
compact with a mirror and then it does
come with its own you know kind of
sponge and I actually just use this I
think it's fine to use and I was a
little bit freaked out when I saw this
because I was like that's white so
that's gonna go on my face but it's
crazy to me how nice it is I mean I like
finishing powders and you know I put
powders on every once in a while I don't
think I always need them but sometimes
they can kind of help me out but it
really honestly looks like you just
filtered your skin when you use this and
I did not think I thought of the three
products that I got I was like okay it's
gonna go foundation and then primer and
then this powder and I honestly think
it's more like primer powder foundation
it's totally weirding me out I did not
think I would love this one
but Jilla beauty is a brand that I now
have my eyes on and then I would also
recommend it trying out if you haven't
yet I'd love to know if you guys have
any favorite products from julep or you
know please leave it in the comments for
other people watching and reading the
comments as well you can also find julep
Beauty at Ulta but I did notice they
were pretty pricey
I think the primer is $28 and then the
foundation I believe was in the $30
range and the powder was $32 so they are
at Ulta beauty but a little bit on the
higher price point side but I now have
my eyes on julep booty as well because
I've enjoyed these products another
brand is the one that I was going to
include in the aprons that I want to try
but I had just recently received a PR
package from them so I was like I know
I'm going to be trying them soon so I
don't know if I can
really included in the brands that I
want to try because that's supposed to
be brands that I've never tried before
so I was like maybe I'll just wait and
see if I could mention them in this
video I just recently tried out this eye
shadow pellet in my video Friday's video
trying out new drugstore makeup and I
was like well wait a second with this
eye shadow palette so I am talking about
sleek makeup they sent me there when the
sun goes down i shadow pellet and i did
a first impression with it for Friday's
video this is what the the palette looks
like and i even say in the video that i
kind of judged a book by the cover which
i shouldn't do and i know that but when
i opened it up I wasn't necessarily
blown away I wasn't like oh my gosh yes
girl I was like okay that looks nice but
the shades worked out really well for me
and I did say in the video you know this
is a first impression I need to see you
know I need to try more shades first of
all I only tried like four shades in
there but they all applied really nicely
no fallout which was awesome the
shimmers were looking really good the
bats were blending out but I was like
one thing was drugstore makeup that
sometimes I can notice with eyeshadows I
said they fade throughout the day no
matter what primer it is that I use the
eyeshadow was fade by the end of the
night it was quarter to ten when I took
my makeup off on the night that I filmed
this and my silver eye shadow that I
applied in that video was still poppin
there had been no fading whatsoever so a
little update from that video I will
keep trying this out for sure so I can
give it a full review when I do a first
impressions follow-up video but so far
so good with this and it has me pretty
excited you can also find sleek makeup
at Ulta but they are on the more
affordable side this entire palette was
only $13 they have other eyeshadow
palettes that have a lot of different
products in there so I would love to
know what else you really enjoy from
sick makeup what you would recommend of
course me and two others but that gonna
be pretty excited so I would say maybe
check out sleek makeup I don't feel like
I hear a ton about them either so I did
want to include it in this video
especially after I tried out this
palette so another brand that I want to
recommend is SL miss glam or SL miss
glam Beauty I saw masculine beauty was
started by Stephanie I will have her
youtube channel and also her Instagram I
listed down below she is a fellow
youtuber and she started her own
company and I think that she's most
known for her brushes she has a few
different products as well but I feel
like she's really well known for the
brushes I have the teal glamour brush
book here and I've also had some brush
sets I'm she was kind enough to send
them to me I mentioned them in a video I
think it was my seven brands in 2017 but
now I can't remember but I put it out
there in a video that I was eyeing her
brushes I'm such a makeup brush levert I
said that I was eyeing them and someone
saw that video and actually tagged her
in the video it wasn't even B it was
someone watching the video tagged her
and she reached out to me and sent me
this brush book which was amazing
because it came full of brushes and
these brushes are pretty pricy so when
she scented I I was absolutely blown
away I thought that was so incredibly
kind of her something that she
definitely did not have to do but I
really really enjoyed these brushes
first of all I think they're just like
the cutest if you know her at all or you
see her videos or her Instagram is very
well known for like her pastel vibes and
this is an example of the brush so we
have the beautiful teal handle and then
my brush is dirty because I use it most
of the brushes in this brush book are
pretty dirty like in the glam brush
books you have a mixture between face
and eye brushes they are pretty
expensive but she does have a discount
coats out there and I know she gave me
some discount codes myself which I think
are still available so I will have those
listed in the description box at down
below cuz I think I have the code for
40% off the teal brush book and that
would just be a discount code for you
not an affiliate code but I thought that
was really nice of her to do that as
well but another product I would really
recommend too is her beauty sponge
I love the sponge so much it's this
beautiful kind of pastel pink color I
just cleaned it actually so that's why
it's really big right now but this is
what it looks like when it's wet but I
really like it and it has like the slope
right here which i think is fantastic
these are seventeen fifty for the makeup
sponges so not the most expensive not
the least expensive but I still miss
glam Beauty I mean I guess I would also
consider her an indie braid I don't know
that for sure but I think it's just her
who does it I follow her on snapchat as
well and it looks like she just works
really hard she's someone who I
definitely look up to because she just
seems like such a hard-working
entrepreneur and she loves what she does
so much and she
such a passion for what she does I
didn't want to mention her because I
really really do like the makeup brushes
in the glam brush books and the sponge
is definitely one of my favorites so if
you're looking for a new brand to
support and girlboss to support check
out SOS glam beauty so next up I want to
recommend the brand a flower beauty I
feel like flower beauty I feel like
people know about it and I say some
people talk about it but I don't feel
like it's quite as well-known as I think
that it could be flower beauty was a
brand that was started by actress drew
Barrymore Hewitt did not know I have a
couple items here that I would really
recommend from them I would consider
these to be my favorite this one is my
favorite and I am actually wearing it
today it's their lift and sculpt
contouring palette I have mine in the
shade medium to deep they don't want to
open it because I broke the bronzer
today which I'm super sad about
I knew this palette was getting down
there because I use it so much the only
like downside to this palette is that
the powders are pretty soft so when you
use them over and over again you're
constantly tipping your brushes into
them I could tell it was kind of
crumbling kind of crumbling that was
like oh my god hang on because I love
this palette so much I use it so often
but it has a bronzer shade a blush shade
and then a beautiful beautiful highlight
and it's so funny I thought that
highlight was gonna go first because I
use it so much it's what is on my cheeks
today I thought for sure the highlight
was gonna go first but it's actually the
bronzer and then it looks like the blush
is not too far behind I just need to
repurchase this palette and I was so
upset with myself I actually went to
Walmart the other day Christmas shopping
and I somehow find myself in the makeup
aisle and I found this and I was like
just get it just get it like you know
that yours is going to need to be
replaced soon and I didn't get it and
dang it I was just there last week but I
do want to get another one of this
because I do really enjoy this palette
and Casey Holmes just recently did a
video and she featured a lot of flower
Beauty in there and they worked on a
couple more items that I want to try but
I really enjoyed this palette I think
it's like $14 for the three different
shades and then also their beauty sponge
I really do like sponges again I just
cleaned this one too it was kind of like
cleaning day around here I really do
like this one and it does remind me a
bit of the SL miss glam Beauty that it
has this kind of slope over here and I
really like that for my concealer this
one is a little bit smaller of a slope
than the SL miss glam Beauty but this is
like the softest Beauty sponge I have
ever tried like this material really
to me feels different than the regular
beauty blender the morphe sponge so
L'Oreal sponge Real Techniques I mean
like this feels like just a different
quality of anything that I've ever felt
in a beauty sponge and it is $10 so you
can find color Beauty on their website
and they are also on Walmart's website
and you can find him at some Walmart's
but I feel like I'm hearing some
conflicting things because I thought I
heard that they were actually not gonna
be in Walmart anymore but I was just
there last week and there's a huge whole
displays I mean you know maybe it's in
the process of happening it's just not
happened yet I'm not a hundred percent
but like I would love to see flower
beauty at Ulta I think it would fit in
really well there and I just I really
enjoyed these products and I need to get
another one of these ASAP did wanna
throw a skincare brand in here I really
do enjoy skincare and this brand is just
like all up in my radar at the moment
you might not be surprised that I'm
gonna chat about trixin I just mentioned
the poor balance facial sauna scrub and
my makeup monthly in my favorite section
I really really have been enjoying this
well kind of got my attention from Lila
Hendrickson is that they had it was some
sort of point perk at Sephora and I
decided to pick it up I can't remember
it was a 100 or 200 I think and this is
all I have left of it they had little
individual packets and they had an AM
and PM and I used all of them except for
these two which is the shear
transformation and perfecting
moisturizer otherwise I've used up all
the AMS and I used up the majority of
the PMS except for these mostly just
because I use a sleeping cream at night
so I wouldn't reach for this one as much
but I tried it and they had a 7 day
supply of it and I got two of them so I
tried them out for a couple weeks and I
was like really I really liked that like
I felt like I really got on with that
and so during the Sephora vib sale I
actually went on and purchased a little
trio of these guys and this is the first
one I'm trying out it came with three
different scrubs it was called the three
glowing scrubs for $25 and I'm first
trying out this one and I absolutely
love it so Lulla Hendrickson is totally
on my radar right now I actually just
went through Sephora the other day it
was after I finished my makeup monthly I
went through their skincare section in
particular I was reading about bunch of
their different products which ones
would be good for me added a bunch of my
loves list I was
I'm just I'm on them right now so if you
are looking for a good skin care
recommendation I would say check out
what I had written because I definitely
need more from the brand myself in 2018
the next brand I want to chat about I
don't know if I would necessarily say
that they are underrated I feel like
they're getting more and more buzz
recently but I do believe this is an
indie brand and I think that they you
know I could just just come after shadow
because I really enjoyed this brand and
if you haven't tried them yet I think
that you should I am talking about dose
of colors so I have a couple items here
that I would recommend from dose of
colors I had my eye on dose of colors
for a very long time I really like their
Instagram page and also the owners page
as the owner is Anna and they just
caught my attention I was intrigued and
especially I was always hearing a lot
about their liquid lipsticks
specifically stone and I was intrigued
but I just I couldn't make a purchase
from them they're not the most expensive
with are also not the most affordable
and I just couldn't purchase from the
website I was a little bit concerned
like what if I don't like these products
I'm spending a lot of money on them I'm
just trying them out and you know I'm
much more I'm much more apt to purchase
from like Sephora and Ulta because of
the rewards and you know the return
systems and the points and all of that
and dose of colors recently came into
all dohsa immediately the day that they
released on Ulta I went and bought
myself
the marvelous mob's eyeshadow palette
and also the stone liquid lipstick which
I don't even have out because I think
it's in my clutch because I wore it out
last weekend I mean it like immediately
they went live I had made my purchase
and then stone sold out like super super
quick came past like I knew that was
gonna happen that's why I was there
right on time waiting to make my
purchase if you guys haven't tried dose
of colors yet I would highly highly
recommend it this is the marvelous mops
eyeshadow palette and it's one of my
favorite eyeshadow palettes I take this
traveling with me a ton it's just a like
I mean it's pretty simple and basic you
just have five different shades here all
in the mouth type of family and you go
from light to dark and has a nice mirror
it's really nice packaging easy to
travel with like I said and the shades
are very very nice I was very pleasantly
surprised because I really wasn't sure
what to expect with the eyeshadow
palette they aren't $32 so again they're
not the most affordable but they are
really really nice quality
and Irish remind quite a bit and I also
really do like the liquid lipsticks I
think I have maybe five liquid lipsticks
and then I also just purchased another
set off of uLTA Beauty one of their
holiday sets I just purchased that as
well I've purchased everything myself
from dose of colors I really enjoy this
brand I feel like they're getting more
and more buzz recently I think it's
fantastic they did a great collaboration
with desi and Katy who are social media
influencers and I feel like that collab
went over very well also I picked up a
few pieces from that too but yeah I just
wanted to mention them if you haven't
tried them out yet you've been waiting
for that push I'm telling you make 2018
there that you tried out the colors last
friend that I want to mention is one
that I don't feel like I have tried
enough from yet and I really want to
change that in 2018 but they do have one
of my favorite products and this is a
survived cosmetic and have the eyebrow
pencil here because I love this eyebrow
pencil I will definitely need to
repurchase this when I run out of it
because it is truly one of my favorites
it is called their infinity a waterproof
out eyebrow liner and I have mine in the
shade Audrey it reminds me a bit of like
the precisely my brow pencil from
Benefit here's what it looks like I just
find this super easy to use and I love
how my brows look with it I take this
one traveling with me quite a bit cuz
again I just think it's like super
simple to use and I really do enjoy it
but another reason I wanted to recommend
Thrive cosmetics in case that you
haven't heard from them yet is that they
really have a pretty special mission
with our brand which I just think is
awesome I love trying to find brands
that also give back at the same time and
they are very keen on giving back to
women going through cancer or even
domestic violence so I will have their
website in their Instagram link down
below of course and they have a page on
their website about us their story how
they give back and you can kind of see
how it all works out why they started it
that way I also really do like and I
come find it it might be in my clutch as
well we have kind of like an eyeshadow
stick I have one in a really pretty kind
of like gold champagne color now looks
really pretty on the eyelids as well um
so I like both of those but again like
this is one of my favorite eyebrow
pencils like I know I've mentioned it in
the favorites section of my makeup
monthly before - I would totally
repurchase this as well but I just
wanted to mention them I don't feel like
I see them get a ton of hype out there
and I wish that that would change
because I think they're a company that
does pretty cool things so if you have
checked out thrive cosmetics yet I hope
you will or if you have and you have a
favorite product from them please leave
it in the comments down below so myself
and others can check it out okay so
that's gonna be everything for the eight
brands I think you should try in 2018
again a lot of these brands where brands
that I have recently tried and I want to
try more from in 2018 those kind of like
another theme of this video but I hope
you guys enjoy hearing about the eight
brands we know of course if you have
tried any of these brands your favorite
items from them or which brands that are
now on your radar and as always if you
guys enjoyed this video I hope the two
of you want a thumbs up I hope that you
will also consider subscribing before
you go and I will catch you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
