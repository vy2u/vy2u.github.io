today's video I'm really excited to do
because I'm going to be sharing about
eight YouTube channels under 8000
subscribers that I watch that I enjoy
that I think other people should be
watching as well I know I think I'm a
little bit late to the game on some
changes that YouTube has made recently
and put out a couple videos and the past
week or so just explaining that I've
taken a little bit of a break from
social media and things like that with
some things that are going on in my life
but I think I was a little bit late
seeing the news that YouTube has made
some changes to their partner program
and how it's affecting a smaller
channels and so when I saw the news and
I was watching other people's videos and
snapchats about it I was like what can I
do to help like that's kind of a first I
was like what what is it that I can be
doing to help and I thought maybe I
could make a video I love doing videos
like you know other channels that I love
watching and things like that so I
thought I could make another one and
kind of focus it on smaller channels
that are the ones being the most
affected by these changes from YouTube
from what I understand from what I have
gathered there changing up their
partnership program and you have to have
a thousand subscribers and is it four
thousand watch hours or watch minutes in
order to be able to do things such as
monetizing your videos and there are
some other items that go along with that
but I know a lot of people are really
concerned and you know kind of
expressing their frustrations as they're
worrying about their YouTube channels
and things like that so I thought I
could come in and just kind of give you
a list of some of my favorite smaller
channels I have everyone is under 8,000
except for one channel just reached over
the 8,000 mark but especially because
watch time is a part of it as well that
can vary super great late I'm depending
on your channel that doesn't really have
anything to do with a subscriber so I
kind of thought I would just focus it on
the under the 8k mark seem to assume to
kind of fun to do so we're doing 8 under
8k I really hope this video will maybe
help some of these other channels and
you know maybe help them find some more
subscribers and things like that I would
love if anybody would leave maybe if you
have a channel or a few of other
channels that you enjoy that you know
you feel like are considered smaller
channels or maybe they need some help
during this time
please leave bills in the comments down
below share the video if you want to
share the video as well whatever it is
that we can do but this was kind of like
my best thought plan for how to help so
hopefully that makes a little bit of
sense of where this video is coming from
and I hope that you guys enjoy it and
you enjoy seeing my channel
recommendations all of these women on
here I think are really hard workers I
think that they deserve more subscribers
and more channel views and all of that I
enjoy watching their videos a lot of
these ladies I consider friends myself
and I talk to on a very regular basis so
I thought that this could be a fun video
to do so if you want to see eight
channels that I recommend for you to
watch here on YouTube when we go ahead
and jump into it they sorry for that
longer intro but I just thought I would
kind of throw out where the idea came
from and say that I'm really sorry that
I'm later to this video I think I was a
few days behind seeing the news about
everything since I was taking a bit of a
step back from social media and I
totally understand where the frustration
is coming from and you know I've also
seen some posts recently on on Facebook
and such of trying to understand YouTube
side of it too I mean it's hard YouTube
Google I mean there's a business
involved in it and I can kind of see the
pros and cons of each thing I will say
for me one thing that I kind of
immediately thought about when I saw the
news was I've actually had this happen
to my channel twice now where another
channel pops up and literally Pirates
your entire video
and luckily each time I've actually had
other subscribers see that happen but
they somehow steal your entire video and
put it up on their channel and the
reason that I want to do that is because
YouTube used to let just anybody become
a partner and monetize their videos so
it was almost like they were stealing
videos and hopes to get views and hopes
to give money maybe a video would go
viral viral and they would make a lot of
money and that sort of thing and it's
actually really time consuming as the
person who is being stolen from to
report that to YouTube it takes a lot of
time you have to individually report
every single video and it does take a
while I know I heard Lauren my beauty
talking about this fairly recently that
I happened to her as well and how much
time it takes that's just kind of one
example that that popped up in my head
I truly believe if people keep creating
and keep putting out good content and
keep working hard
you will meet those thresholds and you
will be able to be in the partner
program so my big piece of advice is
don't give up don't let this you know
make you stop wanting to make youtube
videos number one on the list is my
friend Mickey or I think she's so cute
she calls herself makeup chef here on
YouTube the last time I checked she just
very recently started her YouTube
channel and she has just under 200
subscribers Mickey is someone who I
consider a friend we talk almost every
single day via snapchat and I just think
she is such a sweet and caring person
also her husband Charlie I think is just
like the sweetest man as well I love
Mickey so much and I was so excited when
she started her channel and it's so
crazy she sent me a package once and it
had a letter in it and not too long ago
I was actually because I keep a box of
everything that I've been sent from
subscribers letters you know photos cars
anything's like that cards it's not like
I said cars no one has sent me a card oh
but I was going through it when I had a
couple months ago and I pulled out her
the first letter that she had sent me
and I was reading it and she made a
comment in there about you know me being
an inspiration to her and motivating her
to start her own channel and that was
one of one of her goals for herself and
I read it and I started to cry I got so
emotional because I was like and you did
it like you did it it's hard to start a
YouTube channel and I know that there's
always so much advice out there like if
you want to start a channel you just got
to start it but it's definitely hard and
it's definitely daunting to put yourself
out there and especially if you know
like me I didn't know anything about
cameras or editing or anything like that
when I first started and it was really
overwhelming trying to learn and you
know you kind of invite yourself into
the public eye and you note all the
negative comments that could come within
all of that and so I remember snapping
it to her and I was like do you remember
writing this like you thought you put it
out there you said that that was your
goal and you went out and you did it and
that's freaking amazing so I just
thought that was really cool so she's a
very new channel but she does a really
good job of putting out consistent
content so of course all of these
channels are linked in my description
boxes so I would go and check mickey out
another gal that I want to recommend is
a Kelly or K Bella Beauty I'm the last
time I checked on us doing this list she
had just heard 500 subscribers Kelly
is a longtime friend of mine on YouTube
I know that we have done a collab in the
past but I can't remember off the top of
my head but even that collab was but she
is a really good friend of mine again I
talked to her in a very consistent basis
as well she is a teacher and then she
also does at YouTube for fun she says a
lot that you know YouTube is one of her
hobbies she just really enjoys makeup I
also really enjoy Kelly's channel she's
been doing this for a long time as well
and again she's really consistent I
believe she owes her youtube schedule of
when she post videos and she does a lot
of content similar to minor thing but
she also does quite a few tutorials over
there which I don't do as much as on my
channel so if you like that I think that
you would like at Kelly's channel if I
want to mention at Brianna Mae I've been
watching her channel for quite some time
as well she has just over 700
subscribers I feel like I've been
watching her for quite some time too and
we kind of connect not only on the
Beauty side but on the book side as well
I know that she recently started a book
blog which I thought was so cool if you
guys don't know I'm a published author
as well as a book blogger I always have
my links to my books and also my blog in
my description box if you're interested
in that but I think that's really cool
so we can kind of bond over two really
big parts of my life as well but she
also has a really great youtube channel
she definitely does a lot of tutorials
over there but also likes to talk about
makeup so I recommend checking out
Brianna next up I have Jaclyn Rey which
can I read my own handwriting Samantha I
believe she has about 2.5 thousand
subscribers Jaclyn she's someone who I
found fairly recently
I mean I'm gonna say maybe within like
past year or so and we have the same
type of dog we both have of Isla which i
think is so fun and I follow her on
snapchat and I show my husband her snaps
of her dog all the time because like we
are those weird like breed owners is
anybody else that way with you are breed
of dog like if you're out walking and
you see someone watching walking you're
same breed of dog you go up to each
other and you're like hey got that dog
too like that is how I am my husband is
with leash laws and a lot of other
visual owners we have met seem to be
that way but I love watching her
snapchats
and and seeing her dog but I also really
enjoy her YouTube channel as well not
not just for her dog but she has a good
channel too and she has pretty
consistent
videos as well and I just think that
she's a really sweet so I hope that you
will check Jacqueline out next up I have
Alex or a beauty addict next door who
has 2.6 subscribers
Alex is kind of who I say is my first
youtube friend she's the first youtuber
that I did in collaboration with which
is always really fun and we talk on a
very regular basis as well on snapchat
she is always commenting on my YouTube
videos I'm always commenting on her
YouTube videos she has a crazy work
ethic as well I know at one point she
had like four different YouTube channels
which was crazy I think she now has two
but not only does she have the beauty
attic next door where she does tutorials
and reviews and things like that but she
also has beauty blogger 101 so I'll
leave both those channels linked up
below but I feel like that one is also
very interesting because it's aimed at
Beauty vloggers and she kind of gives
information and I've learned a lot and
I've gone back and watched other videos
you know either about editing or camera
settings or you know tips and things
like that
and I think that's a really good idea
and really cool of her to do so
definitely wanted to recommend Alex next
up I have a Katie or Katie Marie from my
vanity who has 2.7 subscribers katie is
she's been a longtime friend of mine we
actually bond at first over Instagram
and she also very recently started her
YouTube channel but we had a bond
already on Instagram
we were always you know supporting one
another over there and I got so excited
when she was going to start her YouTube
channel and I remember thinking like
this girl is crazy because she already
has a young daughter and then she was
pregnant and then she was like almost
start a YouTube channel and I'm like
girl most people most women wouldn't
they get pregnant they're like I'm gonna
scale back a little bit not Katie
Katie's like I'm a start a youtube
channel right now I'm gonna work my butt
off to post videos consistently and keep
coming up with new content Oh while
being praying I'm like girl you crazy I
don't know how she did it I think it's
amazing though she did recently give
birth to a son so huge congratulations
to Katie and she's still posting videos
on YouTube I'm like wow that's mean she
she just blows my mind her work I think
I think is amazing and I love
Katie I think if you really enjoy my
content I think that you would
absolutely adore Katie's channel so
definitely make sure to check her out
she was my moderator also when I did my
life chats she was with me every single
week for an hour sometimes even more
moderating my content and I just thought
that was amazing she's such a good
friend so you need to Katie out for sure
all right where are we number seven you
guys know I can't I can't count what I
make list
I can't count so don't don't hate me if
I mess this up number seven is Robin
from Robins cup of tea I'm fairly
confident I mentioned Robin in my last
Beauty youtubers that I like to watch
type of video that I did that was a few
months back but I'm pretty sure she was
featured in that video as well because
I've been watching Robins channel for so
long and I really enjoy her content that
she's someone who's just just her
personality I just enjoy so much but
work I feel like we're very different
personality wise like she's kind of just
like I don't how would I describe it
like she's just very kind of like
straight maybe like dry sense of humor
is maybe what I'm going for like
sometimes she says things in a video and
I'm like okay it was that funny and then
like she'll laugh or say something on my
gagger but she cracks me up she has a
cat named Tut who I think is super funny
I'm not even a cat person but I enjoy
Robins cat but I really enjoy her videos
and she uploads very consistently as
well so definitely want to check out is
Robin and then the eighth and final
channel that I want to talk about when I
had her on my list when I thought about
doing this video and then last night
when I was looking up subscriber counts
she was at 8 points who that was in
which is super exciting but I was like
nope I'm still gonna mention you Georgia
because I love your table and that's the
Georgia Harris found Georgia's channel
and I fell in love with it I fell in
love with her we talk a ton now over
snapchat and Twitter and things like
that
and I just think she comes up with
really unique videos she's someone who's
really good at kind of the creativeness
which is typically what I kind of lack
so I really enjoy watching channels with
people who have that more artistically
creative mind is what I'm trying to say
I don't necessarily have that but I
really enjoy watching channels like that
I like
kind of like the palate redesign and she
does this really funny video of like
mixing all these lipsticks together and
coming up with like what she call it
like a Franken lipstick Franken it's
Franken something that was really funny
too but I really enjoy her channel and
again I think that she's a really good
one in the beauty community and I think
that you should definitely check out
Georgia huge congratulations on a
thousand subscribers that's freaking
awesome still hadn't mention you in this
video so those are my eight channels
under a K that I highly recommend that I
love watching their videos I consider
these ladies friends that I hope that
you will go check out of course their
links are in the description box down
below and as always like I said if you
have other channels that you want to
mention please put it in the comments
section this is a good time for the
beauty community kind of band together
once again and maybe show some support
to other creators so I would love to see
that if you want to share the video you
know that I hopefully that we can be
helping other channels out as well of
course there are so many more channels
than 8 I mean just as always even when I
do the the other channels that I enjoyed
a watch I have to kind of cut it off
some wire but definitely share your
favorite channels here and then share
them on other platforms and things like
that but again don't be discouraged if
you're someone who's being affected by
the the new YouTube rules keeps going
keep creating of this is something that
you love to do you will soon hit those
thresholds and don't get too discouraged
if you guys want to see an updated video
on you know maybe like YouTube tips or
things like that I've done some in the
past but if anybody would like an
updated video I can try to get that on
my list and and put out some good ideas
for you as well but again I'm sorry I'm
a little bit late to the game on this
one but I really wanted to help out and
again my own small way I wanted to be
able to try to do something so yeah
that's gonna do it for today's video I
hope that you enjoyed it I hope you
enjoyed seeing some YouTube
recommendations one of my favorite
things to do is like channel shoutouts I
try to do it as often as I can and I
think especially during this time it can
be really helpful as well so if you guys
did enjoy this video of course I hope
that you'll give it a thumbs up I hope
that you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I will catch you guys
