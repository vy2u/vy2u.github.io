space video it's going to be my review
and thoughts on the new subculture
palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills oh
man okay
I feel like everybody is scared to now
make this video because unless you've
been living under a rock
Anasazi Beverly Hills has released a new
palette this is the sister Cala to the
Mount of Renaissance this is soap
culture and when I was there a lot of
drama around this palette there's a lot
of drama there's a lot of backlash
there's a lot of very interesting videos
there's a lot of very strong opinions on
this palette here my review thoughts my
feedback and why don't we go ahead and
get started so the new subculture pellet
from Anasazi Beverly Hills honestly
there are so many videos out about this
I will include little clips of my
tutorial but the full tutorial will be
over on instagram if you want to see it
again
I will also insert a photo of some
swatches but I just don't feel like I
need to go through and swatch everything
because I feel like what a lot of people
want to see right now is reviews and
feedback on the palette so that's mostly
what I'm going to focus this video on
alright so this little palette looks
like it is just like the modern
Renaissance it has the kind of velvet
front here and then this is what the
inside looks like you do get a mirror
you also get a double-ended brush and
then you have your 14 shades says these
future grungy matte and fold metallic
shades with an underground edge the
palette is of $42 if same as a modern
renaissance at the time that I'm filming
it in stock on Sephora and Ulta it was
out of stock of the Anasazi website but
if it's back in stock that is 10 this
video goes up I will have it linked down
below in all of the places where I can
find it for sale I picked mine up from
Sephora I did not do the initial launch
on the Anastasio website also because I
enjoyed purchasing from Sephora also
because they like their reward system I
also trust Sephora and Ulta a little bit
more than the anasazi website I've had a
few issues ordering directly from the
honest a via website so on a retailer
where I felt a little bit more
comfortable I should also get some
points and some Ebates at the same time
I'll link my wilai via below where I
talked about this palette and you could
tell in that video I was just super
hopes of this palette I said I was super
hyped for this palette in my bill a bias
video of some I started seeing the
reviews coming out and I started seeing
just the absolute
and bashing on this pallet I was super
upset I was really bummed but honestly
I'm being clearly honest I got my head
that I was like well then I just shan't
buy it you know I don't want to waste my
$42 of Apella is really so terrible and
my snapchat had a big part of convincing
me that you know no you just need to go
ahead and buy it you know we want your
opinion too and that means a lot to me
when people want my reviews and people
want my feedback that means a lot to me
and that's something that I don't take
for granted so I thought okay I need to
go ahead and get it before it does have
a nice return policy if you order
something from before you don't like it
you can return it within a certain time
frame so I thought I really do hate it
like everybody is telling me I'm going
to hate it then I can return it but at
least I gave it a try
so I feel like I don't feel like I just
don't even know where to begin or where
to start if you follow me on snapchat
you've seen I got this pellet on
Thursday I'm filming this on Sunday you
have seen that I have been trying this
palette like crazy when I got it I did
and I look on one eye at different I
look on the other eye one come off I
look I look wipe them off I look I look
I've been wearing this palette every
single day since I got it which again is
only been a handful of days but I've
also been doing multiple looks in the
days because I wanted to see how all the
different shadows performed and what I
thought about them on my eyes what I
think about this palette is that I
really like it sorry if you are coming
here for bashing on this palette then I
suggest that you leave if you are coming
here and you already have your mind made
up on this palette whether you own it or
you don't
you already have your mind made up but
this is the worst palette of 2017 it's
so awful to just close me out of this
video because that's not what this video
is going to be about I like this palette
I don't love this palette but I really
do like this palette so I want to tell
you guys why I like this palette what I
think the pros and the cons are who I
think this palette is good for until I
don't think it is good for so obviously
the biggest issue that everybody is
having with this palette it seems like
is the amount of fallout and the whole
hitting pan scandal after using it one
time okay
this palette has a ton of fallout a ton
of fall up but so does my modern
Renaissance
this definitely has more fallout than my
modern Renaissance but my mind of
Renaissance gets a ton of fallout as
well my lorac lorac has very soft
eyeshadows health they have a ton of
fall out dose of colors my marvelous
mouth
palette the very first thing that I
noticed and I think the first thing I
said when I reviewed that palette is oh
my gosh there's so much kick up a lot of
palettes have a lot of Fallout I mean
it's just the way that it is so the
amount of Fallout does not bother me
because it only takes me two seconds to
tap my brush off and it only takes me
two seconds to blow my palate off so the
amount of Fallout does not bother me is
it something that I noticed right away
and is it something that I would list as
a con yes as I have with those of colors
as I have with my Renaissance as I have
with lorac palette so the fallout is
definitely a con but it's not something
that I think makes this the worst
palette of 2017 the next issue that
people have been having to that they're
hitting pan extremely early this I
shadow palette is such a unique formula
it reminds me in ways of the modern run
font but it's definitely a different
formula than the modern renaissance
which kind of does disappoint me because
I know that they say this is the sister
palette to the Minor Renaissance this is
like a dark edgy sexy version from the
modern renaissance but I was hoping the
formulas would be a little bit more
similar because the modern Renaissance
is so loved it's such a like Holy Grail
staple favorite palette for so many
people myself included I was hoping it
would be more on the minor of
Renaissance I'd I know they're sisters
not twins but I was a little caught off
guard by the formula it is extremely
extremely softt I could tell just when I
put my fingers in and the matte shades I
want to point it out the matte shades
are extremely soft these shimmers so we
have a dual chrome right here we have a
dual chrome right here and then this is
a metallic shadow the rest of them are
matte those three shades are pressed
very very firmly into the palette to the
point where it's almost kind of hard to
get the dual crumbs and the metallics
out I think they are very pretty I have
both electric and cube on my eyes today
I think that they are very pretty but
they're definitely packed super super
firm
and those are kind of hard to get out
but the map shades are very very soft
when I was just putting my fingers and
to swatch them I was like whoa that is a
very soft formula so when people are
going in with their brushes and digging
their brushes in things aren't happening
there's a lot of fallout I understand
that people are getting pan and that
sucks and one thing that I will say a
couple things that I want to say I'm
hitting pantsing is that I'm not someone
who like goes ham on my makeup
if you watch my use and abuse makeup tag
I'm like yes I wanted to do this tag but
not a lot of my makeup looks abused
because I'm very careful and I'm very
kind to my makeup I know some people
really like to go ham and just get in
there but that is not me so I think
that's a reason why this palette
actually works for me is because that
you need a softer hand when you're using
it and that is my style of makeup so if
you know that you're someone who really
just goes to town on your palettes this
probably isn't going to be for you
because I can see you hitting pan or
than you probably want to another thing
that I want to say is because of the
reviews that were coming out I was also
aware of that you know maybe if I hadn't
seen these other reviews or I didn't
know how soft these shadows are maybe I
would have gone in there and gone crazy
in hit pan I don't think of what else
because of my personality when it comes
to makeup and my techniques but that was
something that I was already aware of
and I knew how to handle the shadows I
understand that I understand that there
are some videos out there where people
are trying to be overly dramatic I mean
I think we can agree that there are
several people out there that are doing
insane things to their palettes for the
views and for the drama which is very
strange to me but same time I think
there are people who that's just how
they're used to eyeshadow palettes and
that's how they did the spell and then
also in are like old my gosh holy crab
now I've had pan I've only used as
palette two times so I'll show you a
close-up of my palette this is a
close-up of it I have used every single
shade out of this palette and I have
used this palette oh man I don't even
know guys I kind of have lost track I've
done probably 15 eye
looks or so with this palette again
using every single shade that's when my
palette looks like I've not hit pan on
any of my shape
another issue that I've been seeing a
lot is that people are saying these
shadows do not the lines well what I
will say about that is this dark purple
shade right here is called rowdy I do
not think that shade blends at all but
what's really funny to me is that that
shade actually reminded me a lot of a
shade in the Jacqueline Hill morphe
palette it's on the bottom row I think
it's the second to last shade it's very
similar i swatched it thinking maybe
it'd be a dupe they're similar but
they're not dupes but that shade I can't
get to blend either in the dry clone
palette there's a shade in the Too Faced
weak peach palette which I really enjoy
a once it's called Derby when I'm not
positive that Shea doesn't blend well
for me either I'm not the greatest at
doing makeup and I'm not the greatest at
blending and sometimes when it comes to
darker shades
I can't blend them and I can't blend
this shade most of the other shades I'm
not finding any issues with I've used
like I said I've used all the shadows on
my eyes been finding that they're
working really well for me especially
the lighter shades I mean those don't
take me any time to blend I have no
problems with them the darker shades I
feel like are harder to blend but I feel
that in most eyeshadows palettes that I
use so that's not necessarily an issue
for me
and also for me I don't really use dark
shades like this a ton so it doesn't
bother me if I have the one to two
shades that I don't use in a palette
because that's standard to me for every
eyeshadows palette not I buy so that's
kind of what I think about the blending
issue on these really interesting to me
too like how I said in the beginning of
the video if you already have your mind
made up on this palette and I hope that
you've already clicked out but one thing
that I found very interesting when I was
going through on my snapchat and doing
some different looks I mean obviously
I'm sharing one look on snapchat and you
know all these people are seeing it and
I'm getting the comments coming in and
some of the comments are like girl it
looks great it looks like it blends well
I love that it looks segmented etc and
then other people are looking at the
exact same photo and same girl but does
not blend at all that looks terrible
this palettes awful you need to return
it so that's why I think if you have
your mind made out that you hate this
palette then you just you're just gonna
hate palette and I don't know I don't
know what else to do for you because the
I thought was super interesting to me
that I'm showing the exact same look and
I'm getting such different feedback
those are you know some of the cons the
the fallout live almost has to have a
specific technique with a palette which
I understand is frustrating but at the
same time it's not something that deters
me enough that I don't like this palette
the blend ability is not there for all
of the shades but for the majority of
them I don't have an issue with and I
know that the color selection like some
people are like I don't get the color
selection I actually really like it
because it pushes me out of my comfort
zone I don't do these kind of like
grunge a dirty looks a lot but I've been
really obsessed with some of these
shades especially this edge right here
the yellow and this kind of like funky
orange I think it's super cool destiny
is kind of olive green shade I've been
really obsessed with that there's a lot
of shades in here that pushed me out of
my comfort zone and for someone who I'm
not very artistically creative sometimes
I need a palette like this to kind of
help push me and not do my same standard
looks over and over and over again
because I definitely have a comfort zone
when it comes to makeup so those are
some of my cons and some of my pros at
the same time I mean I mentioned a few
as I was talking about the cons or I had
you know a flip side to a con but the
biggest Pro I think with this palette is
that these shades are so intensely
pigmented this palette is insanely
pigmented I will have a swatch photo
insert it in here as well but even just
slightly dipping my fingers in to the
palette to get a swatch I'm like are you
kidding me now I have seen I haven't
watched the full Stephanie Nicole video
I was trying not to watch as many review
videos as I could before I filmed mine
because I just didn't want to get too
many different thoughts in my head and
you know things like that but I you know
obviously I see conversations and I see
what people are saying and so I mean
Nicole said that she thinks that these
are more like pure pressed pigments I
believe is what she said I will have her
video linked down below so you can check
it out as well I really enjoy her
reviews I can't wait to watch the whole
video and because I'm very curious to
see all of her thoughts but she
mentioned that she thinks the pellet is
of pure pressed
pigments and how those can be super soft
and you do have to be more delicate with
them and I would agree with that I'm not
as knowledgeable about makeup as someone
like Stephanie Nicole so you know I'm
just going to kind of have to go what
she says but I would agree with that
because this is such a different formula
than anything I've really ever tried I
will insert some clips from the tutorial
that I did here and like I said it will
be on Instagram but you will see me just
lightly tap my brush and then I flip it
around right away to show you and you
see how much pigment
how much shadow is on my brush you do
not get that with a lot of different
palettes even the palettes that have the
super soft shadows lorac Joseph colors
even those you don't get that type of
pigment on your brush extremely
extremely pigmented I will say when you
start to blend them then they can kind
of lose their pigmentation so what I
prefer to do with almost every single
shade I've used in here is to use more
of a patting tapping motion on my eyes
and not do so much at the harsh blending
because then especially with the darker
colors then those shades can kind of
fade away so for me that's how I like to
do it
I completely understand if you don't
want a palette that you have to change
up your technique that makes total sense
I absolutely 100% get that but for me
it's not something that bothers me and
it's not something that you want to
return this palette it's not something
that makes me want to never use this
palette it's just okay this is what I
have to do for this palette those other
palettes that I really enjoy that aren't
super pigmented but I take my time build
a dough's up and to blend them out
because I like the palette so much so
it's just really going to come down to
personal preference but definitely I
feel like the biggest Pro is that these
are insanely pigmented eyeshadows
another pro for me that could be a con
for others is the color selection like I
mentioned this pulls me out of my
comfort zone this makes me create
different looks than I would with a lot
of other palettes and I'm super into the
shades in here again that's going to be
personal preference I will say I didn't
like the brush I put that brush in the
cons but the brush I don't think is any
good and I also don't like the blending
side of the brush and like this side of
the brush because it's very very
scratchy and I feel like
was what the shadows are like in the
palette you need with a softer brush so
I don't think the brush is like cohesive
to the palette at all some very confused
by that versus in there another big
thing with this palette is that I think
depending on your type of makeup
technique is going to depend on if you
like this palette and it will work for
you like I mentioned I'm very like soft
and gentle when it comes to my palettes
I just am you very rarely see my
palettes even getting very dirty you
don't really see I mean it I'm a hard
pressed to say if I have a palette that
you see me hit pan on because I am so
very light when it comes to my makeup
and that's just the way that I am so I
actually don't mind that I have to use
such a light hand to go onto a palette
it just works for me if you're that
person like I mentioned earlier but you
just really like to go crazy then I can
definitely see you not getting along
with this palette and I can see you you
know probably hitting pan right away I
don't know how long it's going to take
me to hit pan because I'm not going to
waste my palette to figure that out
so that can be a pro or a con either way
another thing that I think is a pro is
how little shadow you need to get very
intense payoff I think that's fantastic
and I don't understand why people are so
upset about that because I would like to
use this little product as I can and get
such intense color of my eyes that's all
fantastic to me but so many people are
like mad at that I don't really
understand that part but I don't know it
is what it is but that's another really
big Pro for me and my pros personally
outweighs a con so for me what this
palette I really do like it do I love it
now do I hate it now am I going to
return it no I return makeup if I don't
like it I would love to give my $42 back
if I thought I'm not going to use that
palette and I just despise that palette
I would take it back to Sephora I'm not
going to because I like it I have to bet
I film with a sony a 5100 which I really
enjoyed this camera as a very beginner
friendly which is fantastic for me but
it overheats after about 13 minutes and
I have to let it cool down normally it's
okay but when there's a video where I
just want to sit down and talk and have
all my thoughts compiled it can be
really frustrating because I've had to
cut myself off now a couple times and
then I kind of lose my train of thought
and I'm like what was I just saying so
I apologize if my thoughts kind of
seemed scattered all over the place or
things like that but it's really
frustrating when you have a camera that
overheats when you're trying to just sit
down and like get all your thoughts out
at once that can be super frustrating
but kind of is how I want to wrap up
this very different review style of
video is that I think this palette is
going to be very very personal
preference and I feel it that's the way
with a lot of makeup so it's very
interesting to me seeing all of this
backlash and seeing this drama about a
palette I feel like it has brought a
really ugly side out of a lot of people
which is super super disheartening to
see we have enough problems out there
with cyber bullying and bullying and
violence in general and to see people
attacking other people over an eyeshadow
palette has been very eye-opening to me
to be very honest this want to remind
people that this is just an eyeshadow
palette and it's just makeup if you
don't want to buy it you don't have to
buy it if you want to buy it and you end
up hating it retailers like Sephora and
also will take them back Anastacio will
take them back I know nor vina put out
on her Twitter that they will take the
returns which I think they have a return
policy anyways I'm not a hundred percent
on that but she reinstated on her
Twitter that if you don't like this
palette you can return it so I don't
know I just I guess I don't understand
the drama I don't understand how
horrible people are being to one another
over makeup so I just kind of wanted to
give a reminder of it's just makeup
guides and it doesn't have to be as
serious as so many people are making it
out to be I just wanted to sit down and
give my thoughts and opinion on this
palette and my thoughts are mostly
positive
yeah there's cons about this palette
there's things that I don't love but I
still think it's a good I shadow palette
I just think it's very different and
people weren't ready for it I think if
there's any mistake that Northey know
from anasazi Beverly Hills made with
this palette is that there wasn't any
sort of like of frettin about what the
pigmentation what the formula was going
to be on the Ty shadow tell it I think
that was probably a mistake not to come
out to say and by the
the formula is like this this is how
you're going to want to use the
eyeshadow palette because I don't feel
like anybody knew going into this
palette so when people were getting
their first batch of pellets and they're
rubbing their brushes in there like they
normally would an eyeshadow palette
that's not their fault you know that's
not them trying to cause the drama I
feel like it was them how they would
normally test out an eyeshadow palette
but because of the formula being so
different on this people weren't ready
for it I think if there's any mistaken
or Vina mate it was not saying that you
know she put out a YouTube video all
about this palette there was no mention
in there at all about how to even use
the palette or how to prepare people I
feel like a lot of this I don't feel
like all of the drama could have been
saved but a lot of the drama could have
been saved if that would have been
addressed before this palette went on
sale so I was kind of my feedback there
but for me I really like it for my
technique that I use I get along very
well with this palette I don't mind the
fall out at all I don't mind helps off
the shadows are I've been creating a lot
of looks with them and I really like all
the looks this is such an extremely
pigmented palette and I'm very happy
with it
so I don't know there's my thoughts
there's my opinion on the palette I
don't feel like this is the most
professional review I've ever done I
don't feel like I did it how I do a lot
of my other reviews going into the
swatches and talking about each of the
shades and showing a tutorial but again
I feel like with what's been happening
with this palette that people don't
really want that they just want to get
someone's feedback on the palette I hope
that I helped you out it's also been
really upsetting to me on my snapchat to
hear people say I don't even want to say
that I like this palette because people
are attacking me like on Twitter and
stuff that's ridiculous
don't attack someone over me Kelly come
on guys come on so many bigger problems
out there like it's just it's just so
crazy to me but I like this palette and
I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon
of wanting to start drama and wanting to
cut down this palette when I actually
like it again if I don't like makeup I
return it I'm not going to sit and
continually spend my money on items that
are just going to clog up my collection
that I'm never going to use I see myself
reaching for this palette quite a bit
especially when it comes time for the
more fall makeup looks because I feel
like there's a lot of really fun fall
look
you can do with this palette I have no
plans to return it I really enjoy it for
$42 I don't feel like that's a bad price
for a high-end palette The Naked heat
was $54 I returned that the Too Faced I
shall tell us are usually $49 I think
cap on D is around the $48 tart like
tartlet of bloom that was $46 the bigger
Tarte palette tart Pro I think within
the $50 range so for this to be $42 I
also wouldn't find that as a bad price
for a high-end palette and I really like
it I don't like it as much as my modern
Renaissance I don't know if I would be
able to classify this as a favorite I'll
have to play with it a little bit more
but I like it enough that I think I will
reach for it very often and I do like it
would I recommend it to everybody not a
chance because this is not going to be a
palette for everybody not only is the
color selection very different but you
will have to almost kind of baby the
palette you will have to adopt a
different technique with this palette
and I understand that not everybody is
going to want to do that so I don't
think this palette for everybody I would
really recommend maybe going into a
store or if you have a friend that got
the palette playing with the palette
yourself seeing if you think it would be
a good fit for you for me personally
it's a good fit for me I would love to
know your guys's thoughts and feedback
down below I would love to know if you
guys got the palette and what you think
of it I would love to know if you still
plan on getting the palette I'm super
curious to just get your guys's thoughts
I'm very excited to start watching
review videos now but I finally have
this review video up I just hope people
are giving this palette a fair chance
and not just writing it off because of
all these super dramatic videos that
we're seeing with the thumbnails with
every single shade that is hit pan on it
it's just that it's just really really
silly in my opinion but for me
personally the subculture palette works
for me if you think that we have similar
tastes if you think that we have similar
makeup techniques I think it could work
for you I want to see me uses in a
makeup tutorial here on YouTube let me
know in the comments down below I would
love to create a tutorial over here I'll
be doing some on my Instagram as well
including the look and I'm wearing on my
eyes today so that's going to do it for
my review and thoughts on at the Anasazi
burly whole subculture palette I really
hope that I didn't leave anything out
like I said I hate that my camera cuts
me off when I'm trying to do these types
of videos because I can kind of lose my
train of thought but
I forgot anything that I wanted to
mention I will pin it in a comment down
below so I can have it out there like I
said all the links will be down there as
well and yeah I'm excited to chat with
you guys in the comments you guys know I
read and respond to all of my my
comments so I'm excited to have some
conversations with you guys and what you
think about it down there but that is
going to do it for my review and
thoughts on the I massage ear a little
subculture palette I sincerely hope that
you guys found this video helpful or
useful in some way if you did I hope
that you will give it a thumbs up I hope
