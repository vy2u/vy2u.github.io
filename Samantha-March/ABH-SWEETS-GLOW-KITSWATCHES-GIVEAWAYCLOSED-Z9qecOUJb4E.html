I'm really excited for today's video
because it's going to be a first
impression swatch and giveaway of the
brand-new anastacio Beverly Hills
glow kit in sweets so I am really
excited this just came out I believe it
was last week and the moment I saw it I
was like this is a glow kit for me guys
know me at all you know that I have like
such a sweet tooth so this palette was
just like calling to me and I thought it
was really cool because a lot of the
colors inside are very unique so I was
super excited to get it
I ordered it off the Anastacio Beverly
Hills website that was the first time
that I've ever ordered directly from the
Anasazi website usually I purchased her
products at Sephora or Ulta so to give
you guys a little bit of a story I
thought my experience ordering with
Anastasia I placed my order Friday at
about 5 o'clock p.m. I got the shipping
confirmation Sunday afternoon and the
FedEx package arrived on my doorstep at
Wednesday at about 11:00 in the
afternoon so it was very very fast like
I was super impressed with the shipping
also do get free standard shipping on
products over $25 which i think is
pretty amazing so very impressed with
the shipping I was so excited to get
these not only because I was excited to
one for myself to be able to do a review
for you guys and just to play with
unique colors of highlights because I
don't have any like that yet but I was
excited because I got a second one to do
a giveaway for if I open up my box and I
take out the first one so just like all
the other glow kits they have that kind
of packaging and then I opened it up and
there's the little plastic and if you
guys can see shattered so sassy grape
and butterscotch are shattered and I'm
like well that sucks but I'm like you
know what it's it's fine like I can deal
with the broken product whatever maybe
I'll contact Anasazi maybe I'll just
leave it highlighters break anyways I
don't
I want a bucket highlight that's not
broken whatever no big deal as long as
the giveaway one is not broken because
obviously I can't give away a broken
product that's not cool
oh I take out the giveaway one I open it
up I pull up the plastic and once again
shattered once again
sassy grape and butterscotch are
shattered and I'm just like oh come on
like now I have $80 worth of broken
product sitting here what am I supposed
to do can I even do a video I clearly
can't do a giveaway what am I supposed
to do so I immediately went to my email
like the order confirmation that I got
and I emailed back I took a picture of
both of them and I said I just got my
package today both pellets are broken
they respondent within five minutes and
said and forward your email to this
email address but if you also want to
email this email address with your photo
will help get it turned around for you
and I said in you can also call our
customer service line if they're usually
a little bit faster so I sent the email
to the email that they said to send it
to along with the photo I also called
customer service I mean it was really
nice and you know she was apologetic and
they said that they're shipping me out
to new pallets that was my experience
with ordering the sweets palette so now
if you would like to see the actual
swatches I have not swatch them yet
myself so why don't we go ahead and
swatch this palette together but having
into the swatches this might be
interesting to do with a broken pallet
but here is a close-up of all of the
colors it says they are metallic powder
highlights and they are for intense
luminosity so this is the sweets palette
so we have marshmallow sassy grape
butterscotch and taffy all super cute
names definitely what drew me to it but
you can tell there's like this like a
kind of like electric yellow there's a
purple there's a beautiful gold right
here which I'm really attracted to and
then this taffy color is just so intense
and interesting but especially with
these top two colors I don't have any
highlights in my collection better like
that you know my highlights are the
standard champagne and gold and vanilla
and frosty I don't have any colored
highlights and so I
this was a really interesting concept I
was kind of going back and forth between
sweets and she also has the new things
called moonchild get out that also has
very like different shades of highlights
in there but I went with the sweeps
because I got a sweet tooth so going
through I'm going to look at the website
well I read these to you but marshmallow
the first one it says it's an intense
pear with gold reflect okay so there is
marshmallow is very intense I don't know
if the camera is like picking that up as
much as in real life but that is a very
very intense it is almost like a I would
almost say like a yellow-green
what's it say with gold reflect okay I
mean I can see that but it almost kind
of pulls a little bit green as well but
that is intense whoo that's awesome that
would be really pretty has a lid color
too but I'm excited to try it out as a
highlight and then next we have sassy
grape which says it's a lavender with a
blue reflect okay so this is one that's
like really really broken it is super
super soft you guys as I was watching it
it just broke even more in my hand
okay so again yes very
Wow these okay it's broken and I'm upset
about it and sassy grape will literally
just like crumbled even more but that is
seriously super stunning a look at how
like metallic that is Wow
that's really cool that's really cool
okay so that was sassy grape the next
one is taffy which is a fusion of peach
pink and gold reflect oh it sounds like
my friend okay so this is the other one
that came broken and as I'm swirling my
finger in it it did not crumble like
sassy grape did so that's sea grape just
like fell apart oh my god are you
kidding me right now that is Wow okay so
that was taffy a fusion of peach pink
and gold
reflect
yes wow that is so so pretty that is so
so pretty oh my gosh that's definitely
my favorite one so far which I kind of
thought would be but wow that is so
beautiful okay so the last one is taffy
which is caramel gold with a white
reflect oh that sounds really pretty oh
wow
so all of these I mean obviously just
looking at the swatches of my hands are
very very pigmented and very very
metallic I really like that one - I
really like taffy as well that might be
better for like deeper skin tones but
seriously these are all very very pretty
okay so I have to say that I'm relieved
that the swatches are going well so far
because I'm honestly like once I saw
that they were broken - I was like what
if I swatch them and just absolutely
hate them so I don't know if you can
tell like sassy grape completely fell
apart so I can no longer even like hold
up this palette to show you guys I want
to go ahead and swatch some on my face
as well so I think maybe I'll do
butterscotch on one side and taffy on
the other just so we can get an idea of
it I do still wish these palettes came
with a mirror on them I don't understand
why those there's no mirror on them
that's weird okay so I'm gonna take my
morphe m 501 brush and dip that into
butterscotch and we're just gonna go
ahead and oh wow so so pretty so
pigmented wow I love how metallic these
are like I know it said that they were
metallic but still like that is like
beaming okay so that's gorgeous so on
this side I'm gonna try the taffy okay
so this is oh that's really beautiful as
well I wasn't really sure it was gonna
like be okay with my skin tone like but
still oh yes whoo that is
see okay okay this is cheered me up just
a little bit more cheering me up a
little bit more okay all right okay I'm
not mad I'm not mad right now okay so
those are just a couple of the live
swatches on my cheeks Lee I don't even
want to put like my fingers anymore and
a sassy great because it's literally
just crumbling away but I just wanted to
do a few live swatches so you guys can
actually see them on my cheeks in here
all these swatches on my hands I okay so
the pigmentation the actual color of
them are gorgeous if you a final
thoughts about the palette like I said I
do have another Anastasia Beverly Hills
glow kit and I absolutely love it
I think the pigmentation is great that's
that was another reason why I wanted to
buy another one of the glow kits is
because like I really really thought
that product was amazing I'm incredibly
disappointed that not one but both
pallets came broken it's a little bit
disheartening but I was really impressed
with the Anastacio customer service it
was just boom boom I mean within minutes
they had new pallets on the way to me
kids do run for forty dollars so that's
what all her glow kits are ordered from
the Swedes a glow kit right now is only
available on the Anastasia Beverly Hills
website I don't know for sure if it will
be at like Sephora and Ulta like the
other Anastasio products are my guess is
yes usually with new releases they
release first on the actual brands
website and then if they do have
affiliations with like Sephora Ulta and
other retailers they slowly go into the
stores at a later time so right now this
is only available on the Anastasio
Beverly Hills website would I recommend
it I right now I would just seen these
first impressions and seeing these first
swatches I'm really really impressed
with this is this going to be for
everybody no because there are very
unique shades to highlight in here so
unless you are like a highlight junkie
or an Anasazi Bartlett Hills junkie or
even these like glow kiss junkie I feel
like no matter what you're gonna want
these anyways but if you're just wanting
like a pretty highlight to add to your
collection these might be a little bit
too out there for you but hey if you
like to experiment it could be a good
thing
and also I would definitely see about
using these as eyeshadows my Glo kit in
that glow I have used a sunburst as an
eyeshadow all the time but also has an
inner corner highlight and I've also
used dripping and gold as an eyeshadow
the other two I'm sure I can use as
eyeshadows as well at just have it you
can intermix them and make them I shadow
as well or you can come up with really
cool highlight looks so would I
recommend it right now yes if I get my
next order and both palettes are also
broken I'm gonna be a little bit
concerned but as of right now simply
based on my first impressions I'm gonna
say that yes I would recommend it $40
for four huge highlighters is not a bad
price I will leave this link below on
Anastasio website if you are interested
in purchasing one for yourself but like
I said I am going to be giving one away
as well so why don't we happen to the
