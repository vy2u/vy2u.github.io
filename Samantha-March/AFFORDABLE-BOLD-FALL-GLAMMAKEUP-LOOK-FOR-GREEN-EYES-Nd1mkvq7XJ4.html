hi everybody thank you for watching so
today's video is going to be a new
makeup tutorial is going to be on this
bold fall glam look we have a bold I we
have both lashes we have a bit of a
boulder lip and I'm just really excited
for you guys another makeup tutorial I'm
slowly getting more comfortable making
these tutorials here on YouTube I've
been doing a ton of them over on
Instagram we not only gain confidence in
doing my makeup because I'm not a makeup
artist I'm just recently learning how to
do makeup so doing those Instagram
tutorials kind of took a little bit of
pressure off me helped me get more
comfortable with makeup and also more
comfortable with editing tutorials
because it is really really hard when it
comes to editing so i'm excited i think
i would have a couple more fall looks
that i'm going to do for you guys and
I'm just excited to do more makeup
tutorials over here because I have found
them to be a lot of fun and I'm actually
to the point where like today I knew
like what colors I wanted to use and you
know a few of the certain eyeshadows I
was going to use but I really just kind
of like and winging it and this look I
mean I didn't expect it to be like quite
this all over bowled we even look like a
boulder brow but I mean head like it
just is what it is that's how it turned
out to be and I actually really do like
this look so we are also using all
affordable products in here all the
makeup products and the brushes that I
use are all from affordable brand so if
you want to see how I got this bold fall
burgundy affordable makeup look please
keep watching so I'm going to start off
with the eyes so I'm going to first use
the BH Cosmetics and carli bybel
palettes and I'm going to use my morphe
m4 for one and pick up this third shade
right here it's like a light purplish
brown eye shade I don't know it's really
like the only transition color that I
feel like is in this palette i'm going
to go ahead and use my fluffy blending
brush and just apply that in the crease
and a little bit above it as my
transition then i'm going to use my
morphe g13
to pick up this last shade in the
palette right here is a very dark purple
and I'm going to apply that all over the
lid so I like this look for green eyes
because purple is the color that is best
known i think for bringing out green
eyes and it's so funny because I
remember like so many years ago the
brand all may it's a drugstore brand it
they came out with it was like little
qua their little eye shadow trios and
they like I can remember watching the
commercial and then saying like oh and
each one is designed for like a specific
eye color so they had once for brown
eyes blue eyes and so the one that they
had out for green eyes had all like
Purple's featured so I always thought
that was really cool it's like something
I remember cuz i bought the one for
green eyes and I like rocked purple so
hard after that came out but purple
really is one of my favorite shade so
when I decided to do this kind of like
fall like purple burgundy kind of a
little bit of a glam look I also thought
I could incorporate something for green
eyes as well since a subscriber did ask
for that so this is kind of like my
go-to glam look at the moment I like
about this brush is that it's good for
packing on color but then it also is
kind of like a blending brush as well so
I just will kind of sweep it through the
crease also just to kind of avoid harsh
lines but I will go back in and we're
not done yet so our work is not done I'm
going to dip into my Z palette this has
my makeup geek shadows and I'm going to
take this shade right here it's called
bitten it's a really pretty like deep
burgundy red shade and I'm going to use
my pencil brush from morphe it's an e 18
and I'm going to pick up a little bit of
the bitten shade and I'm going to apply
that into my crease just to kind of give
us more of the burgundy look as well so
it's not just purple I wanted to add a
little bit of burgundy because that
seems to be like a really hot color
right now for fall so this is how I'm
going to incorporate it and because it
such a deep shade my advice is to start
small and then just keep building it oh
I'm going to apply it like towards the
outer crease and the outer be and then
slowly work my way in and it's just to
give us a little pop of color if you
prefer to do just the straight purple
totally fine totally your call I just
wanted to incorporate the burgundy in
here somehow probably see that like my
shadows are really messy but that's okay
that's why I start off with my eyes
because I will clean that all up when I
go in and start my face once I have all
the bitten on there that I want i'm just
going to take my EG 13 again with no
extra product and then just do another
blend use my Maybelline master precise
liquid liner and I am going to make a
fairly bold wing for this look my face
next before I finish up with the eyes so
it's a prime I'm going to use the Milani
Prime shield this is there man sighing
and pore minimizing primer it's not my
favorite primer because it like feels
very like silicone e to me I don't know
if you can see that it just kind of
feels like odd on the skin but I do
think it is good but it is one of my you
know affordable primer so I wanted to
use it and I don't like dislike it like
I don't want to like get rid of it I
just wouldn't say that it's my favorite
primer foundation i'm going to use from
l'oreal the True Match Lumi I'd
absolutely love this foundation and I
feel like I've been neglecting it lately
so I'll bring it back I'm in the shade
w5 so I'm going to apply it with my
morphe m 439 brush and I'm just going to
go ahead and do a couple pumps on here
just to save me the hassle of having it
on my hand because I don't love that
this has been one of my favorite
foundations for a very long time I have
no idea how I have not run out of it yet
but whenever I do I would totally
repurchase this it's very long lasting
feel
super nice on the skin and it gives your
skin just like a luminous glow like it
doesn't make you look too shiny or
anything like that it just makes your
skin look healthy which I love this
foundation brush from more feet is also
one of my favorite brushes and it's
super affordable so the m4 39 love it
I'm sure I'm going to use my NYX sculpt
and highlight duo so I'm first going to
take the highlights side so I'm going to
play that underneath my eyes also apply
some to the center of my forehead down
the bridge of my nose Cupid's ball and
any left over I'll put on my chin and
then I'm going to buff that out with my
morphe g2 one of my favorite brushes for
this task I do like the next sculpt and
highlight duo I like the contour side
more than I like the highlighting side
cuz I don't feel like it's um I don't
feel like it's a ton of coverage I think
it's good enough but I really do like
the contour side both ends are really
easy to blend out though which is nice
but it's a it's a nice product it's I
mean it's affordable because it's from
NYX but i do think honestly it's like a
little bit pricey for next like for the
drugstore brand but it works good baking
i'm going to use my maybelline it's the
loose setting and perfecting powder so
i'm just going to take a damp Real
Techniques sponge and dip it in there
and then apply this to my under eyes my
under eyes are typically the only areas
that I bake so I'm just going to link
that sit for a little bit and then move
on to the contour going to use the other
end of the knicks sculpt and highlight
duo and to contour the cheekbones I
start like a little bit above the ear
and work my way down and kind of curve
it up around so it like kind of hugs
where the cheekbone is and then same
thing on the other side and then i will
also contour the forehead just
a little bit oops you blend out the
contour i'm just going to use my real
techniques sponge and go ahead and blend
it out and then i'm going to go ahead
and dust away the baking powder the
maybelline powder so one thing about the
maybelline powder when I put it on it
doesn't show up very heavily but if you
wait a few seconds I don't know what it
is that it likes s or something but you
can see like it looks very different
from when I first applied it to now and
as I didn't put any additional product
on or anything and so the first couple
of times that I use the powder I felt
like I kept having to going so I was
like um is nothing happening like what's
going on here but even if you just go in
once with the application just wait a
few seconds because I like it will show
up I promise you it's just very strange
my other like I have the laura mercier
secret brightening powder it doesn't do
that so I just always have kind of
thought that was a little bit weird but
I'm going to dust it away with my morphe
e3 brush and with this powder to like
just really make sure that you're
getting everything off realize that if I
wasn't doing a good enough job dusting
away like sometimes I you know you're in
a hurry or whatever it's just like you
do one of these but you're you still
have some left you want to make sure you
get everything off because if you don't
then you can fall victim to that white
cast if you do anything like flash
photography so make sure you get it all
with the wife grab my elf it's the blush
palette I think it's in light yeah and
it does have a bronzer shade so I'm
going to use my morphe and 5 30 and I'm
going to bronze the face and then also
kind of help that to set the cream
contour that we did as well
I'm going to switch again I'm finish off
the eyes but off-camera I am going to
fill in my brows I'm also going to apply
lashes just that I'm going to use our
the grin glamour these are from i lure
in Vegas neighs some of my favorite
lashes and they're very dramatic has a
lot about loud boom to them so when I'm
going for a glam look like these are
what I tend to go for and you can get
them at target so finish off the eyes
I'm going to come in with my color pop
this is one of their pencil liners and
it's in the shade best oh it's just like
a burgundy shade so I'm going to apply
this into the water line and then I'm
going to come back into the Carly
palette with my morphe e36 brush now I'm
going to put a combination of these two
shades at the end so one is that purple
that we have all of our lid and then the
other one is just kind of like a deep
brown shade so I'm just going to kind of
mix the two of them and see what it
looks like on the lower lash line I put
the brown in here to kind of help
balance out the purple and the burgundy
because sometimes especially with a
burgundy shade it can if you use like
too much you can kind of make you look
sick almost like it like you have like
red sick eyes you know what I'm saying
so that's why I use the darker brown to
kind of help just balance everything out
and I kind of like the smoky look that
that darker shade is kind of given the
eyes like more of a smoked out lower
lash line actually really like that cuz
I'm just going to apply some Maybelline
lash sensational mascara one of my
favorites
blush I'm going to come back into the
elf blush palette and use my morphe for
and i'm going to grab this a bottom
blush here try something different i
don't really have any affordable
highlighters but like I really really
like but I just saw Jacqueline he'll do
this on her snapchat the other night I'm
like you know what I'm gonna try it she
use to highlight from the morphe a
shadow palette I don't have the pella
that she was talking about it think is
like the 35 e but I have the 350 here
and I'm gonna pick up this third shade
right here it just looks like a really
lights like kind of pink sparkly look
and I'm gonna use my ELF small tapered
brush and we're just gonna see I've
never done this before so I don't know
maybe it won't turn out maybe you won't
be able to see it but I'm gonna give it
a try because I was like you know what I
bet I do you know how I shadows that can
be used as highlighters I use puppy love
from colour-pop it's a i shadow but I've
used it as a highlighter before too so
I'm just gonna go ahead and see how this
turns out okay so I don't think it's
going to shabby but it's not super super
highlighting I don't know if the camera
wouldn't even pick that up like I can
see it in my mirror but it's not
anything like will be him in your face
or anything like that but it'll do it'll
do for in a pinch trying to be trying to
be innovative here so normally was such
a darker look on the eyes I would go for
more a nude lip but I'm like you know
what like I'm busting at all things fall
here and like all things burgundy in
this video so why not just keep going
with it I'm going to use the NYX soft
matte lip cream it's in the shade Rome
which is like a deep burgundy color I
believe I haven't actually used this one
in a while so we're just going to go
ahead and just really go for it
so the bold Ilyich with bold lip I
totally get it a dude would look really
nice in this even like a brown will look
nice but I'm just going all out for this
is turned into my bulb fall look not
exactly what i was going for when i
first started but hey you never know
once you start applying makeup you just
got to go with it but once the lips are
done there's actually going to complete
my bold fall glam look using all
affordable products this is the final
look I really hope that you guys enjoyed
this tutorial like I said I do have a
couple more fall looks coming your way I
just picked up a few pieces from the wet
