today's video is going to be another
fall inspired makeup look using all
affordable products and then also using
the Jaclyn hill palette this has been
really requested to do some fall makeup
looks with as well as doing you know
more affordable options on the face so
that is exactly what we're gonna be
doing today so if you are excited to see
an affordable fall a makeup look when we
go ahead and get started all right so I
am gonna start off with the eyes I do
have them primed and then also set and
like I said I'm going to be using the
morphe and Jaclyn hill palette now I
wanted to do a full face you know
affordable fall look you have seen that
one being requested quite a bit but then
everyone was asking me also for this
palette and so I asked a couple people
because I said well morphe brushes is an
affordable brand but I thought this
palette was kind of priced a little bit
higher and a little out of more fees
like kind of traditional palette range
but people said they still wanted to see
it incorporate it in here and I've seen
a lot of other people doing affordable
looks also using this palette so I
didn't want to go ahead and point that
out but I only do makeup tutorials once
a week on my channel they're usually
posted on Fridays and they're not
necessarily always a tutorial sometimes
their first impression sometimes they're
just trying to make up things like that
so I don't know how many more like
tutorial style videos I'm gonna do so
this palette had been so requested so I
wanted to find a way to be able to
incorporate it it is $38 so like I said
I just feel like it's a bit higher most
of the markets are usually around the 22
dollar range if you can use discount
codes there's always a morphe discount
code floating around so you can knock
some money off of the palette to make it
a little bit cheaper but I'm so to go
ahead and get started I'm first going to
use the third shade which is called silk
cream I'm going to use a brush from
morphe it's part of their copper dreams
brush set and I just really enjoy the
blending brushes in that set so I'm just
gonna go ahead and put this into my
crease stuff I'm gonna pick up the shade
at creamsicle or just using another
blending brush from that same set so of
course there's 35 different shades in
here so obviously there's a lot of
different options you can do I've done a
lot of different options with this
palette I'm also
apply creamsicle in the crease and just
a little bit lower than silk cream so
there's a lot of different options you
can do but one of my go-to s with this
palette is some of these beautiful reds
and yellows in here and oranges I just
think it is so pretty
so that's what I want to do today
especially since people are really
enjoying these types of looks for fall
myself included so what I'm going to do
but I think I actually want to do an all
matte look a lot of times I come in with
at least one shimmer but I think I'm
gonna try to keep this look all matte so
I'm just slowly working up creamsicle a
little bit lower and the crease it's a
pretty pigmented yellow so if you go in
too heavy-handed it can be a little a
little intense so I just work slowly to
build it up going to grab a third
blending brush and I'm going to come in
to this shade right here which is called
hunts and it like this shade I feel like
I can say it with a few shades in this
palette how I say it this is my favorite
shade but this is definitely one where I
say this is my favorite shade it's
incredibly incredibly pigmented but
still really easy to blend and just I
mean it's just awesome so that's really
all there is to it
so I'm just gonna start by patting this
on the outer part of my eye that's
really where I want to get the majority
of the product down and then I'll slowly
start to blend it into the crease not
too far and then flick it out here at
the end I don't want it to come in too
close to the inner part of my eye I want
this one mostly focused out here and
then flick it out a little bit and into
the crease and I'm going to take a
morphe M 505 I think this is kind of
like a blending brush it's just a little
bit on the different
because I'm gonna take the shade here in
the middle it's called Roxanne and I'm
just going to Pat this on the lid mostly
focused on the inner part like I said I
wanted all Matt I but I want all the
shades to really kind of complement and
blend into one another I'm just gonna
kind of Pat Roxanne on to the lid I
didn't want anything super overwhelming
like a really dark color or a really
light color I wanted to be able to see
just like a gradual like fade of
everything kind of what what I'm going
for with this look here so it's gonna
kind of Pat and blend
I feel like this brush is kind of unique
for that because it's like dense enough
that I feel like I can Pat the shade on
there but then it's also kind of like
blending brush to something once I've
got that shade down I'm gonna pick up
just a tiny bit of creamsicle and kind
of go through and blend everything
together and kind of just bring a little
bit more of that yellow back I'm
actually gonna switch over to my face
for a little bit so I know that the eyes
look pretty crazy right now but this is
always the point and the makeup steps
for you're like is this gonna come
together not going to come together but
I am gonna press pause on the eyes right
now because I have all the shadows laid
down that I want to I don't think I'm
gonna do liner or lashes for this look
because I'm trying to switch things up a
little bit in last week's video I did
winged liner and then I also shared
false lash Tips &amp;amp; Tricks how I applied
them showed a demo things like that so
I'll have last week's tutorial linked
down below if you want to see that so I
thought even though you know we're still
kind of doing like a red orange a fall
look I thought I could still try to mix
it up a little bit and not too liner or
lashes so and I move on into my face for
the time being I'm gonna go ahead and
spray my face with some of this
pixie hydrating milky miss it's one of
my favorite missive from pixie it says
it's a youth perserving mist so I'd like
to feel like that's why I like it cuz
you know 30 we need to preserve our
youth
like really make sure we preserve it
okay okay so for my foundation I'm gonna
use this one from Rimmel this is the
clean finish of foundation and this is
in the shade 340 nude my friend Mickey
sent this to me to try it out
I tried it one other time and so I
wanted to try it again and see what I
think of it the applicator is really
interesting kind of reminded me a bit of
the wet and wild
applicator I'm just gonna go ahead and
kind of like paddle it on to my face the
shape match is actually pretty good I
think when my summer tan completely
fades that this is going to be a nice
shade match for you know kind of like my
winter my winter skin that sounds weird
but a good shade match for me in the
winter let's go ahead and go with that
so paddle some on it to my face here and
then I'm gonna use my L'Oreal sponge
this is one of my favorite sponges and
it's from the drugstore I'm just gonna
go ahead and blend all that in for
concealer I'm going to use the L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow concealer I picked
mine up from Ulta I don't think it's my
favorite concealer ever but I don't mind
it I think it's okay the smell is pretty
strong which I don't love I'm gonna go
ahead and also kind of clean up the eye
shadows with the concealer since I
didn't use like tape or anything like
that she is also a little bit dark for
me I usually like a little bit of a
lighter under-eye but it'll do it'll do
it was then I'm going to take my L'Oreal
sponge again and just go ahead and blend
it out and then I'm just gonna do a
little bit of baking right now I'm going
to use the pixie the translucent powder
from them it's called the quick fix
powder so a lot of people I saw a lot of
people complaining about the the
packaging because there's actually like
this puff in here and if you pop the lid
off
there's the puff there and
you can you know put it on your face I
saw a lot of people complaining about
the packaging those who have it but if
you twist it off then you just have a
bunch of loose powder right here so
because I totally understand I would
hate putting translucent powder on with
a puff especially because I only use it
for my under eyes but if you just kind
of pop the bottle a half open instead of
popping the top your chances and putter
is just all right here and then I just
dip my sponge right into it I only use a
small amount I don't tend to heavily
baked very often but you can get a small
amount onto your sponge and then I'm
just going to go ahead and apply that to
my under eyes I just have that sit there
for about a minute or two and then I'm
just going to take my morphe III and
dust away any excess powder for my
bronzer I'm going to use the number
seven bronzer in caramel this is like
one of my all-time favorite bronzers it
is so good it's so beautiful I love that
has a mirror
number seven is drugstore you can also
find it in Ulta and I'm gonna use a
modem metallic buffer brush I've also
been really loving this brush for
bronzer I said that Rimmel foundation is
just a little bit light for me right now
since my since my summer skin it's
sticking around Oh crazy though the spot
there because last weekend I was up in
Iowa City I live in Iowa I was in Iowa
City tailgating the Iowa game Iowa Penn
State and it's a late September in it it
was a 93 degrees my son said it's 93
degrees feels like OneNote one it was
crazy
I wonder what to do because when you
tailgate a football game usually it's
like a long-sleeve shirt you know boots
flannel like all the girls are mad like
I just wanted to wear my boy you know
today and meet me I'm loving life
because I love warm weather and they
give it to me all year round but it was
so funny because it was just crazy crazy
how hot it was but I kind of liked it
also going to Browns
for head a little bit as well so when I
was waiting for my camera to cool down I
did go
fill in my brows I've been trying out so
many different brow products lately so
if you've noticed in any of my videos my
brows looking kind of wild that I've not
only been trying out different products
like from different brands but I've also
been trying out like actual different
types of brow products not just pencils
that I normally stick to so just so you
know I'm no brow expert yet I'm a little
bit better but I'm no expert and
sometimes when I try a new product I'm
kind of like what what am i doing just
doesn't look like the other thing but I
also put a little bit of a liner into my
waterline this is from colour-pop and
collaboration with kathleenlights this
is the mr. Bing liner it's just a nice
at brown liner but I feel like not a lot
of people talk about the colour-pop
liners gotta ask the other day my
favorite affordable eyeliner and I was
like colour-pop they're like 5 bucks and
they are really nice they have a huge
variety of colors and they stay in the
waterline all day so color pop has
really good liners so I'm gonna come
back into the palette I'm gonna take my
morphe and the 507 it's just a pencil
brush and I'm kind of going to do
exactly what we did on the lids but in
Reverse if that makes sense so first I'm
gonna come in with Roxanne on the lower
lash line
then I'm gonna come in with huns then
I'm going to come in with creamsicle and
then if I think if I need it I'll blend
it out together I'll come in with the
silk cream shade to try to make this I
look pretty simple as well I feel like
sometimes looking I don't like when I
look at myself in the viewfinder I'm
like well this is not a beginner because
when I see beginner I think like a
really natural and neutral and simple
you know things like that I'm sorry I'm
going to take some of silk cream and
just kind of blend everything together
but that's kind of what I can think of
when it comes to beginner and I know
that we used you know the four shades in
here and that might seem like a lot too
but really it's just one on top of the
other that's how the other blending and
then one shade I mean once you go in and
you start doing it I think that you
would see that it's actually not too
complicated and these shadows really do
blend well so even if you're not the
best at blending which is totally me
like I am not at all
no perfect no professional blender here
let me tell you but these work really
all together and blend really well
together I also wanted to make it
somewhat of a if not beginner friendly
you know intermediate friendly how about
that I pick up a smaller brush the
morphe 36 and come into the first shade
here which is in light and I'm going to
use this on the inner corner of my eye
and also on the brow bone I really like
doing this step because obviously you
can see that you know I really put the
first shadows pretty high up there
so it's nice to be able to come in with
this shade and kind of clean it up a
little bit and then I think I'm gonna
clean up the shadows just a little bit
on the outer part especially since we're
not doing lashes I think I'm just going
to bring in the shadows just a little
bit I don't want to lose too much though
because I still want kind of that flame
effect but we're just gonna do a little
bit so I'm gonna die a little bit of
concealer there I'm just gonna use my
sponge again I'm just kind of cleaning
it up just a little bit more oh yeah I
think I like that even more actually
yeah still a flame still the flame but
not like a full on fire you know I'm
gonna go ahead and add mascara this is
the l'oreal voluminous - paradise I know
everyone got really excited for this
mascara I really do like it as well
I wouldn't say it's like my favorite
favorite Holy Grail mascara but of
course I do wear lashes a lot so
sometimes I feel really unfair when I
judge a mascara I feel like some
mascaras just really can't uh can't give
me what I want because I want lashes to
my eyebrows but this is a pretty pretty
good one especially for a drugstore
option once the mascara is on than I'm
done with the eye so I'm going to finish
off the face using a blush from
colour-pop this is in quarters this is
one of their super shock blushes and
this is like one of my absolute favorite
fall blushes I think it is such a
beautiful color and I like to apply the
color pop blushes with a duo fiber brush
is the Morphy and five and four to seven
and four to seven is that one and has
the same texture as like the colour-pop
super shock shadows kind of like that
moosie type of texture or highlight I'm
going to use a pixie in collaboration
with Aspen over this one is in santorini
sunset these highlights are really
really pretty pixie can be found at
Target the highlights the blushes like
these are really really nice quality
from pixie I'm going to use the brush
that came with the I think this was with
the Miriam the at the Mary of NYC collab
but it has like kind of a bronzer brush
contour brush on one end and then a
highlight brush on the other so I'm just
going to go ahead like seriously it's
the highlights are so pretty not not
really like metallic and not really not
not glittery at all but just very like
hi little globe today so since we went
pretty dramatic on the eyes I'm gonna do
a more neutral lip this is a NYX liquid
suede the liquid suede from NYX are so
so good this one is in the shade at
sandstorm and I immediately immediately
I fell in love with it it's just a
really nice kind of brown nude mm-hmm so
after the lip is done then this'll look
is complete I really hope that you guys
