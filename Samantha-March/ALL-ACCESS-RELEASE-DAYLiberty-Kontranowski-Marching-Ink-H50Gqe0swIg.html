I'm so excited for today's video should
just be a short and sweet one but I just
have an announcement that I wanted to
share with you guys it does have to do
with books and my publishing company if
you guys are new here or don't follow me
on other social media platforms you
might not know but actually what I do
full-time is I own a publishing company
and I'm also a published author I do a
lot in the book world freelance wise
marketing editing proofreading all that
good stuff but that is what I actually
do full-time if you did not know that
but my publishing company that i own is
called marching inc and we have a new
book coming out today which is always
just so exciting and I just wanted to
come on here and tell you guys that a
new book is being published and I'm just
so excited for it so the book is called
all access and it is by debut author
liberty control ski I hope I'm saying
that right I've been so stressed about
citing her name i emailed her and was
like break it down for me I just don't
want to get it wrong so hopefully I got
it right fingers crossed but I'm so
excited for liberty even before we
started working together I was following
her progress of becoming a published
author and we had so many chats about
her manuscript and when we got the
opportunity to be able to work together
I just jumped on it because she's
someone who I know is so passionate
about her writing and her book and just
making it the best that it can be but we
also have so many of the same interests
and it's just so much fun to be able to
talk to her every day I think she has
such a cool chick I'm so excited and
pleased to be working with her and I'm
so so so happy for her that all access
is now on sale like I mentioned this is
her debut debut novel and it's just it's
so special when your debut novel comes
out because it's something that you'll
never forget you'll never forget the
feelings that are tied with it the
excitement the nerves the anticipation
like the stress I mean it's stressful
putting any book out there whether it's
your first book your tenth book or 50th
book it's always going to be stressful
because books are such a personal thing
you know it's it's our imagination is
our
it's our characters it's our words that
are coming to life on paper and then
people are reading it and reviewing it
and critiquing it and giving us feedback
and it can be so so scary and
overwhelming but also it is just one of
the greatest joys out there so a huge
congratulations to Liberty I will leave
the links below to all access and also
to her social media if you guys want to
follow her tell her congratulations
because it is a big day for her or if
you would like to get your copy all
access will be available for sale on
amazon barnes and noble and Kobo and
also the print book will be coming soon
if you love paperbacks that will be
coming soon as well so I want to tap on
here say a huge congratulations to
Liberty let you guys know that my little
publishing company that i started as a
tiny idea and i worked in my office
which was my coffee table with my laptop
in my lap is now growing and we're
adding new authors and new books and I'm
just so excited and so pleased and so
thankful that this is what I get to do
every single day I get to work on my
passion and share it with so many
different people so I wanted to come on
