today's video is going to be all about
the Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern
Renaissance palette so I have not used
this yet so I'm going to do like a first
impression makeup tutorial using this
it's gonna be focused just on the eyes I
want to keep it just you know focused on
this palette but I'll be going through
doing a first impression using this
palette on my eyes I'm super excited
about it I'll also go through and share
like maybe some swatches throughout the
way and just kind of give my overall
first impression in feedback on this
palette now this is not a new palette I
picked it up during the Sephora vib sale
but like I said it's not a new palette
it just got a ton of hype when it came
out and it was being sold out everywhere
I finally was able to get it during the
vib sale and because it hasn't been out
for a while and because so many people
loved it I didn't think anyone would
really want another video on it cuz I
thought you know there's probably enough
tutorials and reviews out there but when
I did my Sephora vib haul which I can
link down below I got so many comments
to do a video with this palette so I was
like oh okay okay I'll do it so that's
why I thought maybe I would do the first
impression tutorial so you can see me
applying them to my lids and just kind
of getting my first impressions feedback
from it so like I said it's going to be
all about the anasazi Beverly Hills
modern renaissance palette so why don't
we go ahead and dip into it and get some
of these beautiful shades on my eyes
okay so I actually really don't have
anything in mind for this look but so
let me just look it over
so again this is what the inside of the
palette looks like it is $42 as the time
I'm filming it is still available on the
Anastasio website and it's also
available at Sephora it is saying sold
out at Ulta again at the time I'm
filming I can put links to this in the
description box below it also does come
with a double-ended brush which I'll be
using just to try out the brush I don't
think I've heard like really and you
think about the brush but I typically
try out brushes in palettes to see what
I think of them again I mean lots of
burgandy shades beautiful Browns of red
they're shimmers there's matte it looks
gorgeous so I think I'm first going to
pick up the shade Ross the yenna down
here at the bottom I'm going to use like
the fluffy end of the brush and then I'm
going to place this into the crease as
my transition color of my eyelids primed
already I used the smashbox 24-hour
photo finish shadow primer so the brush
i wouldn't say the brush is great and
it's already kind of shedding along my
eyes so that's not good with the actual
shade is a really beautiful transition
shade so that's what i'm going to be
placing all along my crease and it's
tried to move closer to the window so
the lighting would be a little bit
better but again that is just my crease
color and then i think i'm just going to
flip the brush and use the other end
don't want to put some of this pink in
here so I'm gonna flip the brush use the
other side I'm gonna pick up a
love-letter and I'm gonna put that I'm
gonna have that be like in the outer V
of the eye so let's go ahead and see I
have no idea I haven't even so washed
these yet so I have no idea like how
pigmented this might be so I'm just
gonna place this on the outer V I
actually like the brush for this because
it's very precise it's like smaller so I
can apply it right where I want that
show you to go
so far both shades of their views have
been gorgeous not a lot of fallout with
them at all nice and pigmented
easy-to-use I definitely like this side
of the brush more than I like the other
side of the brush but again I don't want
the focus to be that much on the brush
it's more on the actual shadows and the
palette itself I know I don't mind being
like messy right now cuz I haven't done
anything like any of my face makeup
either so being messy cuz I can just go
ahead and clean that up when I'm doing
like concealer and such then I'm gonna
pick up some of the Primavera and a
morphe g13 brush so this looks like a
really pretty shimmer shade and so I'm
just gonna apply this on the lid oh wow
that's really pretty this shade is
stunning Wow and I'm just focusing this
on like the inner part of the lid I'm
not taking it out too far I feel like I
could just apply this all day this is
gorgeous
to pick up a morphe m4 3 3 it's just a
blending brush and just kind of blend
everything together kind of merge merge
the colors together I don't have any
product on this brush I'm just blending
away okay I'm not sure I'm done with the
shadows quite yet but I'm going to do my
winged liner for right now and then see
what I think is a look sometimes I'd
need to do the liner and then figure out
if there's anything else I need to do
but I'm going to use the Sigma wicket
gel liner and my Sigma Y of six brush
and just create a wing
so now I'm going to pop a little bit of
the colour-pop get paid it's a metallic
like a rose gold liner I'm going to put
that on my waterline so then I'm gonna
pick up my e36 from morphe and I'm first
going to put some Venetian red onto the
lower lash line I'm gonna focus this one
on the outer part of my eye oh those are
really pretty
Oh using the same brush I'm just gonna
grab some warm taupe and sweep this on
the lower lash line as well and kind of
start this one towards the inner part of
the eye and then blend it all the way
through usually if I'm doing some sort
of like pink or red on the lower lash
line I'll try to come in with a more
neutral colors balance it out so it
doesn't give the illusion of being sick
which is what these colors can sometimes
do to me I'm gonna do some mascara to
prep my lashes for false lashes I'm just
gonna use the Smashbox x-rated mascara
I'm gonna put this on the top and bottom
lashes for false lashes I've been
wanting to use these for a while these
are the Ardell a soft touch lashes so
I'm going to need to like cut and trim
them so I'm gonna apply these off-camera
and then I'll be back okay so I put the
lashes on they aren't quite as dramatic
as as I was hoping they would be but I
still think they fit this look fine but
again off-camera I'm just gonna do the
rest of my face again I wanted this
video to be focused mostly on just the
palette but I'm sorry I didn't do like a
crazy or eye look in all honesty I don't
do crazy eye looks on a daily basis I'm
not a makeup artist or anything so I
just kind of like throw together
whatever looks that I think that I can
do so I thought that I would use more
than I did you know I used the three
shades on my eyelid and then two
different shades on my lower lash line
but I thought maybe I would do something
a little bit different or crazier but I
don't want
started going I was like I just really
like where this look is going so I can
definitely do more licks in the future
and more licks on Instagram as well I do
a lot of tutorials over there too so I
can keep playing with the palette but
yeah I didn't have any sort of ilyich
when I first went in I just was kind of
like picking and choosing as I went
along so it's a pretty simple easy I
look but I still really really liked how
it came out and I like the colors of it
but again I will finish off my face and
then I will go through the palette and
swatch all the shades so we can see what
they all look like so I will be right
back okay so I do have the rest of my
face done I did film the face tutorial
for Instagram so I will leave that link
down in the description box below if you
want to see any of the products that I
used in my face or how I applied them
that will be on Instagram so that will
be linked below but my lip color is
ashton from anastasia beverly hills so
now that i have this on my eyes i can
kind of give my first impressions just
on the few shadows that i've used and i
used five of them and I thought they
were amazing so I first went in with the
raw Sienna for the crease I mean it was
very pigmented it showed up right away
it blended easily the brush I didn't
think was super easy to use like the
fluffier side of the brush and I had
some shedding so brush probably not so
great but that's okay the next shade I
used was the love letter I used that in
the outer crease in my eyes and I
thought it was amazing I mean I thought
that color was amazing it showed up
right away it was easy to blend even
though I was still using that Anastacio
brush I was using the other side and it
blended super easily very happy with
that and then I used Primavera on the
eyelids and I thought that I could
literally sit there and apply it all day
this like kind of like gold shimmer
color is stunning I will be using that
so much more and then I used a Venetian
red and warm taupe on the lower lash
line and again I thought they were both
both amazing when I first put Venetian
red down I was like oh man that is super
pigmented I might have gone in too hard
and now I'm gonna look like I have some
sort of disease but when I blended it
out with warm taupe which again I
mentioned the reasons why I do that it
looked amazing because warm taupe even
though it might I don't know it might
not like look like anything crazy in the
palette it was beautifully pigmented and
worked to offset the red toast
just still kind of tie everything
together but without looking sick so I
was just I was just beyond impressed
from what I've used so far super super
happy but like I said I've never even
swatched this myself so why don't we go
ahead and do some swatches on camera I
was thinking maybe of doing them
off-camera I just inserting them in here
but let's do them on camera because I
only used a few shades so I kind of want
to see what everything looks like so
I'll go through and do the top row first
okay so here are the first four shades
on my fingers we have tempera golden
ochre Vermeer and then buon fresco not
really sure how you say that but those
are the first four swatches I don't know
if you'll be able to see them I don't
really have like any sort of swatch game
but here they are on my arm yeah like my
swatch game just has never never really
on point there but those are the first
four and that Vermeer looks absolutely
stunning the shimmer shade golden ochre
so I was kind of wondering about tempera
like I can't really tell because of the
sunshine but at first I thought it was
just white but I think it might have a
pink tinge to it and that's actually
showing up a really well on my skin also
I thought that I wanted to kind of just
like fade into nothing and then the bond
fresco is actually a really pretty like
lilac II lavender color I kind of want
to use that one all over the lid that
would be really pretty okay so let me go
ahead and do the next four okay so the
next three from the top row so we have
antique bronze and then the love-letter
and then Cyprus umber these three all
swatched so incredibly well I'm like
okay what I might do is like take a
picture because see how i'm swatching
like more this way because that's like
when I put in them on my are that I'm
doing it but they need to be like more
over here see I'll get I mean I'll get a
swatch game sometime but I'll try to
insert the picture over here so you can
see it butter again all of these are
really pretty love letter I did use
antique bronze looks really really
gorgeous I kind of want to pair that one
an bon fresco together then Cyprus
number just looks like a really nice
deeper Brown and
must has like a hint of red in it as
well so that one is gorgeous so that is
the first line again I'll have the
picture over here that is the first top
row of swatches from the palette and
then let's go ahead and do the bottom
row you have raw Sienna and then burnt
orange Primavera and red ochre so raw
Sienna I used in the crease burnt orange
I actually own it's the only Anastasia
shadow in this palette that I own
already I have a symbol of it and then
Primavera again I used on and red ochre
that looks really pretty and I've
already lost what I said about by
smoshgames so I'll just insert a picture
I'm not even going to attempt to try but
again these all look really pretty as
well burnt orange is actually one of my
favorite Anastasio shades so if you
don't have the single that yet I mean
you know that you're getting a good one
from this palette I love burnt orange I
use it all the time raw sienna and
Primavera I use and I said it was
amazing red ochre looks like a really
pretty I mean like a red brown shade it
kinda reminds me maybe of like biddin
but not quite as red from makeup geek I
don't know it looks really pretty I
think I expected it to be like really
really like a deep red but it's not but
I like it for that reason it's not too
intimidating of a color which I thought
maybe it would be so let me go into the
last three here okay so for the last
three we have Venetian red warm taupe
and then realgar so again Venetian red I
used on the lower lash line along with
warm taupe ooh
Rikka real cars very very pretty so
again I'll put the photo in here so you
can see the swatches on my arm and
everything is swatching really
beautifully a warm taupe I did kind of
have to build up a little bit that's
really the only one that I had to do
that with but I used it on the lower
lash line
and I thought it came out really really
nice down there I didn't have any
problems with it red is beautiful it has
a bit of a shimmer to it and then
realgar like when i swatched it on my
arm i was immediately like whoa that's a
really pretty color I would love to use
realgar and burnt orange together I mean
there's just a lot of different
combinations I think that you can do
with this palette again I did something
pretty simple and pretty Samantha on my
eyes today but there are tons of
tutorials out there like I said this is
not a new palette by any means but after
I did the swatches of it I'm just
getting more and more excited I can tell
like this is going to be one where I
keep reaching for this palette to keep
doing different combinations I tend to
do that when I get new things probably a
lot of us do but like I said I'll be
over on Instagram I do a lot of
tutorials over there I have one almost
daily so I will try to be using this
more for the Instagram tutorials so make
sure you find me over there I'm just
March a beauty word but that's gonna be
it for the swatches I hope that you guys
enjoyed them and they helped you out
I'll post pictures on my Instagram as
well of the swatches but so far my first
impressions from the swatches and then
doing the tutorial on my eyes is that I
am super happy with this palette really
there's not any shades besides like I
said warm taupe I had to build up a
little bit even like tempura which was a
shade that I didn't think was gonna blow
me away this first one right here I was
kind of like oh okay and it's much so
good so I'm excited to use that one on
the eyes as well but other than that
there's no shades in here that I'm like
ooh I don't think so or that didn't
swatch well I'm excited for it I love
the palette because it's like the soft
and fuzzy here I love that it has the
mirror in it so it's very easy to use so
it'll be nice to travel with the brush I
thought was just okay one side was
definitely better than the other one but
super excited I got this this one got so
hyped up it was sold out so often like I
said resin right now it's still sold out
on alta because everybody is just loving
on this palette I'm really glad that I
was able to get my hands on it and for a
20% discount which is awesome so thank
you Sephora I'm super excited that I got
my hands on it though because so far
from what I can tell it is definitely
worth the hype so if you haven't picked
it up yet if you've still been
considering I say do it
the burgundy type of looks and the
burgundy palettes are really big right
now
you know Kylie's got her Burgundy
Hallet huda beauty put out a burgundy
palette it's just all about the burgundy
right now so I know for sure I don't
have those other two that I mentioned
but I know for sure that this one is a
good one I cannot wait to keep using it
thank you guys for asking for me to do
this video I really had not expected to
so when you guys said that you did want
to see you know the swatches and maybe a
tutorial with it that's what got me
excited to do it so I hope that you
enjoyed it and found it helpful like I
said I'll be doing more tutorials either
here or on Instagram using this palette
as well if there's any specific shapes
that you want to see me use or a certain
look I mean just leave that in the
