today's video I am pretty excited to do
it's going to be a collab video with my
friend Angelica and I am so excited to
do this with her we have been talking
forever about what kind of collab we
could do and we both really wanted to do
something where we are kind of switching
makeup looks Angelica if you're not
familiar with her of course Asha will be
linked in my description box down below
I've done a group collab with her as
well I featured her in my newsletter
also still see you as my channel shout
out a couple months back in my makeup
monthly but she is known for her really
vibrant colorful makeup looks i as well
am known for my colorful makeup look I
might be known more for my neutral looks
though I mean it's kind of a toss-up but
we decided we really wanted to do
something where we're going to kind of
switch for each other but we actually
decided that we were going to also pick
out each other's eyeshadow shades and
also each other's lip color so that is
what we are doing today I'm going to be
attempting to create a colorful makeup
look based on some shades that Angelica
chose for me and then she is going to be
doing the same video on her channel and
she has some shades that I chose up for
her and she's going to be creating her
own makeup look so of course her channel
in her video will be linked down below
I'm so excited to do this collab with
her I love her makeup looks they
intimidate me and I've been staring at
these pallets for probably probably
close to an hour trying to decide what
the heck it is I'm gonna do and I'm not
sure yet but clearly I need to get some
eye makeup on this face so not further
ado why don't I go ahead and get started
so I do have my face makeup done I have
my brows done I just don't have my
eyeshadows on or my lip color since
those are built to the items that
Angelica chose for me so we're also
going to be working out of the same
three pallets we have three dubious
placed pellets here and then like I said
we went through and picked out each
other's shades so we have the Sahara two
by Julius place which looks like this
and in this palette Angelica chose out
for me this kind of like it's kind of
like a light minty green
a bluish green color and then also this
map shade right here which is kind of
like a matte red I would say I've used
that one before I haven't used the
shimmer out of this one and then we also
are going to using the deuce a palette
which I'm really excited about it just
featured this and my latest makeup
monthly and I put it in the favorites
section so I really enjoyed this palette
the shades she picked out for me in here
is this pink one here what absolutely
adore and then also this mint green one
and then I'm looking at the little
collage that she made for me so I know
and then also in the siharan palette she
chose out for me I believe this is a
matte black shades that I have a black
to work with as well so I have five
different shades to create an eye look
with have some colors in there as well
alright so now I just need to figure out
what it is I'm gonna do I'm a little
nervous can you tell can you tell so I'm
going to start out in the do se palette
and I'm gonna start out with this pink
shade up here I'm going to use my Sigma
e-40 I'm going it to blend that into the
crease I haven't grabbed out my ears yet
but we'll see how it goes okay so I'm
going to put that one into the crease
let me zoom you in what am i doing wait
so I am taking a that shade and I'm
going to blend it into the crease like I
said I've been staring up these shades
for so long I'm not great with you know
coming up with looks myself i watch a
lot of tutorials I look at a lot of
photos especially like on Instagram for
inspiration because I just don't have
that kind of like artistically creative
mind to to look out a palette and come
up with these kind of looks so it was uh
it was a challenge for me and I love
that Angelica was like I did something
very basic for you I'm like I still
can't figure it out girl like I still
don't have it in me to figure that out
I'm also like I'm super nervous for her
because like I said it's hard for me to
come up with looks so then when I was
trying to come up with a look for
someone else I was like oh my gosh this
is way more challenging than I thought
and we've been talking about collabing
like doing this collab for I mean I'm
not I'm gonna say like two months we've
been bouncing ideas back and forth off
each other
and all these different things and then
we actually
did a group collab the dethroned makeup
products I'll have that one listed down
below so we did a group collab so then
we're like okay let's push our clap out
just a little bit since we just did that
big one and then we came up with more
ideas and then it was like we thought we
had an idea and then one of us would
come back with like what if we do this
so it's been a long time coming but I'm
super excited to do this with her and
just to try something new and to get
outside of my comfort zone I definitely
I definitely have my comfort zone I
definitely have the colors and the
shades and the techniques that I love
doing but I like to I like to try and I
like to experiment with different things
sometimes a lot of times I sometimes I
find that I don't necessarily like love
the end result which makes me a little
bit uncomfortable but you know I like
trying and I like practicing new things
and she definitely inspires me to kind
of like push the push the limits push
the envelope and and see what I can do
I'm gonna come into the so far and -
yeah and I'm gonna take the matte red I
wish I had a better idea for what it is
that like I'm hoping this final look
looks like because I'm really not sure
at the moment but we're just gonna wing
it
I'm filming this like way early I'm
filming this five days in advance just
in case it doesn't go well and I can
refilm it and it's also super dark I do
have my rig light on so if my leg looks
crazy I'm really bummed I looked at our
weather for the week and it's all snow
rain dreary dark so I'm like ah man
you're just gonna have to bust the ring
light out and just go with it so sorry
if the lighting is crazy but I'm just
taking my Sigma e45 and I'm just kind of
placing that on the outer part of the
eye as well because it kind of has this
pink this pink enos to it also it looks
really it looks like a deep like brown
red in the in the palette but it
definitely is coming across as more pink
on the eyes so we'll have to see how
that works but I'm just gonna kind of
blend it into the outer part of the eye
but like I was saying so like I'm really
worried for her look because I don't
know how I did putting colors together I
don't know if they're gonna make any
sense like I just don't know so I mean
she has like
she has talent like I can see something
and I'm fairly decent at recreating it
but like she can come up with stuff like
on her own and she's just really good
like she has talent in that area for
sure so I'm sure that she'll be able to
come up with something but if people are
like oh I wouldn't really put those
colors together like why'd you pick that
color so it's act like yeah that's not
me that's not her don't blame her that's
on me
nothing me because that was that was a
quick struggle for me
this shade actually had quite a bit of
fall out onto my lower lashline but I'm
just gonna kind of like sweep it along
the lower lash line I wasn't planning on
doing that but there was actually quite
a bit of fall out there so we're just
gonna look we're still look a little
crazy for a while maybe maybe until the
end I don't really know but then I'm
just gonna do the same thing on the
other eye I wasn't planning on putting
the pink down there but there was so
much fallout that just sweep it away
since I already do up my face makeup
done to sweep it away probably what it
made it more of a disaster than anything
so that's just what we're gonna do there
so I'm just doing the same thing on the
other eye that was really really pink I
really I hmm
I thought I've used that shade before
maybe I just spotted it cuz there I mean
that was definitely played with but I
don't remember it being quite as vibrant
of a pink
and then I get the same thing I'm just
gonna kind of lightly run that brush on
the lower lash line I bring that pink
down there as well okay so I'm gonna
stay in this palette and i'm gonna grab
out the shimmer shade that she chose for
me here have it used this shade yet so
we shall see how it goes i'm using the
sigma e55 and i did spray it with some
setting spray to make my brush damp cuz
that is how i prefer to apply shimmers
that's really pretty
whoa it is definitely really pretty I
was thinking of maybe doing the other
shimmer on the lower lash line that's
kind of where my thought was going I was
gonna maybe do like both on the upper
but then I was like no I feel like I
want some color and some shimmer on the
lower lash line as well I don't know
we'll see we shall see how this turns
out oh my goodness I love that color
though
dang it looks really cool with the pink
I think so far you like it looks pretty
good
okay then I'm just gonna take my e-40
and blend those so I still need to use
the black from the Sahara palette and
I'm like struggling to figure out where
to put that because I don't use black
shadows a ton I thought about creating a
wing but I very rarely do that with
powder shadows and I feel like when I do
it it just don't look as good as I want
it to so I think I'm going to put it on
the lower lash line so I'm gonna grab
the morphe 43 and I'm going to push that
onto the lower lash line okay and then I
think before I go any farther I'm going
to apply some false lashes because I
know I definitely want when I think of
like really colorful looks I definitely
need lashes to like tie it all together
so I'm going to put some lashes on and
then we're going to come back I think I
still have do I just have one more shade
that I have to use that blue so we're
gonna find we're gonna find a spot to
put that finish off this eye look okay
so I put my pierre de ville ashes on and
then I have this mint green color here
and the Duce a palette to use and I
really like my initial thought was to
put it on my lower lashline for some
shimmer and like sparkle down there so
let me see what that looks like this is
the Sigma smudge brush the e21 it's just
like a really tiny brush so I'm just
gonna dip into that and then kind of
smudge that over the matte black shade
that matte black it's kind of like oh I
don't know if it's fully black it's kind
of also like a forest green at the same
time like a really dark green light
black type of shade if that makes any
sense okay I actually just went ahead
and sprayed this brush as well because
it wasn't showing up as much as I would
like so there we go there's the there's
the shimmer that I was hoping for so I'm
just gonna smudge that on the lower lash
line and I'm gonna kind of like flick it
out over here just I don't know do
something fun
do some fun so kind of flick it out at
this outer part of my eye I feel it on
this eye I still have pink peeking
through but like this I really doesn't
have any of that pink so that was in the
Sahara - so I'm gonna grab a little bit
of that out of the Saharan to this eye
and I don't know kind of smudge it along
below here to try to match up the other
eye it's like the site has a lot of pink
to say not as much okay so I decided to
kind of like wrap it all the way around
the lower lashline and then kind of
sandwich that green like a little flick
that I have going on
kind of like sandwich that in-between
the pink on top and the pink on the
lower lashline nothing I would normally
do and I'm not sure how I necessarily
feel about it but you know what we're
trying to do something to drink it
outside of the comfort zone with colors
so I don't know I feel like that makes
sense somehow so I'm gonna keep my
little smudge brush and go back into
this kind of lighter shimmer shade and
then I also want to put that on the
inner part of the eye so after that
that's gonna be it for the eyes this is
way out of my comfort zone like I felt
like I was pretty much in my comfort
zone for a while until I did this thing
with the pink down here which I feel
like that was decided for me like what
the fallout happened that was basically
decided for me because there was really
gonna be no cute way I was gonna be able
to wipe that off but maybe it was for a
reason to kind of push me a little bit
further you know a little bit or there
but that's gonna do it for the eye look
let me just grab out the lipstick color
that Angelica chose for me okay for my
lip color she chose a shade from NARS
and this is in Ana which I love Anna
it's one of my favorite colors actually
so she's gonna go ahead and put this on
so after I got my lipstick shade on that
is going to do it for this kind of
makeup challenge this makeup swap with
Angelica I think I choose my shades
trying to do something outside of my
norm outside of my comfort zone I feel
like I achieved that with this eyelid
