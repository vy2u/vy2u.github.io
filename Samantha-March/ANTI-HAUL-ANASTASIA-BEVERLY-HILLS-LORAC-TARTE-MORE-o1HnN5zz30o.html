today's video is going to be a new anti
haul video I've been having such a
fantastic time filming these anti hauls
in my will i buy videos because I'm just
really happy that I'm able to keep
putting out videos kind of regarding
like new releases and such without
feeling the pressure of having to go buy
all of them being able to do it and this
order format has just been so helpful
for me and they've also been really like
they keep on getting highly requested
from you guys which makes me so happy so
really glad that you guys are enjoying
these type of videos as with all the
enjoy halls I feel like I need to put a
little disclaimer out there first
not bashing the companies not telling
you guys that you shouldn't go buy it
anything like that I'm just giving my
reasons for why I will not be purchasing
these products no way am I like trying
to cause any beef here or anything like
that a lot of the companies that I
mentioned I do purchase from on a
regular basis but this is I am just a
very normal person it was a very normal
life who writes books for a living I
cannot afford to buy all of these
products which is really like the main
reason why I can't buy everything but I
also go to a little bit more depth about
each product that I talk about the price
of them what they're like who I think
maybe they would be good for and then
with the anti health I explain why I do
not buy these products so I hope you it
will enjoy this anti haul I have a
couple holiday releases that I want to
talk about and then also just new items
that I've asked you guys you know what
what are you curious if I will be buying
or not so I can put it in my next anti
haul so these are all from you guys that
you will requested to see and hear me
talk about so I'm gonna go ahead and
jump into the first item and I'm gonna
talk about is from Anastacio Beverly
Hills it is a collaboration a shadow
pellet it is the master palette by Mario
I think is what it is called
so Anasazi Beverly Hills collaborated
with celebrity makeup artist Mario to
create this palette so there was a ton
of hype around this palette a ton of
hype around this palette it is a $45
sleeve there are 12 shades and it's a
mixture between Matt and shimmers I will
place photos over here of each of the
products that I'm talking about so like
I said lots of
pipe around this product I really like
an associate Beverly Hills I purchased
from her brand very frequently I am
familiar with Mario I know he does like
he's known for doing the Kardashians
makeup and Kim actually has the color
named after her in this palette there's
also a Claudia who is Anastasia's
daughter's name she's also known as noir
Vina and so I thought it was an
interesting palette I like the concept
behind it it's kind of more of a darker
tone of eyeshadow palette like maybe
good for like smoky eyes and that sort
of thing so the palette does look really
pretty but I just kind of knew right
away that I wasn't going to buy into the
hype around it but it's sold out so fast
on Anastasia's website like I mean
before I could even really consider
anything or look at swatches or think
about life it was already sold out on a
sauciest website so I didn't even get a
chance to but another reason I didn't
purchase it I actually don't prefer to
purchase from the anastacio website I
have in the past I've had issues with my
orders I've had issues with customer
service I just I've decided that I'm
just gonna keep purchasing from Sephora
and Ulta if I want on associate products
it's just easier for me you get points
which I absolutely love points and
there's just been kind of a mess of him
ordering directly from the website so
when this palette launched it was only
on the Augusta's nia website which was
another factor of me to not buy this $45
I don't think it's a bad price for that
Anastacio palette the modern renaissance
is $42 honestly I've been really trying
to get the modern renaissance palette I
actually had it ordered once from Ulta
checked out my credit card was charged
and then when the rest of my order
shipped there was a little note at the
bottom that said oh actually we were out
of stock of this product so you don't
get it I'm like what are you kidding me
like seriously so I would rather get
that palette versus the master Mario
palette another big reason is because
this palette will be limited edition so
it is sold out right now on the UH
Nastasia website as I'm filming this
video it is sold out on the Anastasi
website and I'm hearing it will not come
back on the Anastasio website but I also
hear that it will be for sale at Ulta
Sephora and Macy's apparently it will be
coming to more places
so that made me a little bit more like
oh you know maybe I could still get it
but with it being a limited-edition
palette and what looks to be like very
limited edition I know now a lot of
people are going to be able to get their
hands on it and it's harder for me when
I do makeup tutorials here on YouTube or
Instagram whenever I use something that
is very limited edition I get so much
backlash from it like it's just really
hard because I understand you're doing
makeup tutorials and you're teaching how
to do things and so many people are like
well I wasn't able to get the palette I
wasn't able to get it so I prefer to try
to stay away from limited edition as
much as I can
am I never gonna buy a limited edition
no that's just not gonna happen but I
try to limit myself and because of all
the reasons that I listed I was like you
know what this is gonna be one that I'm
gonna pass on so for those reasons I
won't be getting the Anastasia and Mario
palettes but has been asking me about
this next palette it is from the lorac
and it was the mega pro 3 palette so
this was probably one that that was like
the most highly asked to film and I knew
right away like so many people are are
you getting the makeup hell are you
getting the mega Pro palette or you get
in the mega 3 palette and I mean just
immediately I found myself actually like
responding to people like no I'm not and
I'm like no wait hold on like you can
put it in your aunt at all I'm not gonna
get it here are my main reasons I
actually don't own any of the lorac I
shadow palettes and I don't own anything
from lorac in general you know we all
have those brands that we gravitate
towards that we absolutely love that
we've tried their products and love
their products and continue to
repurchase from but obviously there's a
bajillion makeup brands out there it's
like I'm someone who have not tried
every single makeup brand oops
and lorac has just been one that I don't
gravitate towards I haven't bought
anything from them this is a $59
eyeshadow palette and I believe it comes
with 32 eyeshadows you know not a bad
price I guess for how many eyeshadows
you're getting there are math and there
are shimmers but I'm probably not going
to purchase my very first product from a
company and have it be $59 and 32 eyes
shadow because if you have been on my
channel for a while or if you watched
any of my other anti hauls or what
I fight videos I've stated many times
that I'm not a huge I shadow junkie so
for me I I don't tend to gravitate a ton
towards like just eyeshadow pellets are
really big eye shadow pellets because
like it's just it's just not my thing
I know eyeshadow palettes are ton of
others people's things and that's
amazing it just for me personally
doesn't happen to be mine but again the
main reason I'm not going to like dip my
fingers into the lorac brand by buying
this huge eyeshadow palette and spending
the $59 so that really is the main
reason like I said I'm not a huge
eyeshadow person so buying a 32
eyeshadow palette probably not for me
it does look awesome like if I shadows
are your thing this is a huge palette I
know a lot of people are really excited
about it I hear really good things about
the lorac eyeshadows but like I said for
some reason it's just it's not a brand
that I have gravitated towards myself I
probably will in the future I will
probably get there you guys but for
right now I will not be purchasing into
lorac mega Pro 3 if you guys have
purchased it let me know what you think
down the comments below because hey it
looks like a good one it just doesn't
look like a good one for me another
collection that I have been asked a lot
if I will be purchasing is the Selena
collection that was put out from mac
cosmetics a lot of people are doing like
Selena inspired tutorials right now with
these products as he Perkins did I'm an
amazing selena tutorial but it's just
been it's been really cool seeing these
tutorials come out I am familiar with
Selena and her story I've seen the movie
where J Lo portrayed her and I'm
familiar with the you know very tragic
story of Selena's murder thought it was
very cool that Mac was coming up with
this collection in honor of her I just
thought that was that was really awesome
but I'm not going to purchase this again
kind of like lorac Mac isn't a brand
that I buy from a ton
mostly because I think they're kind of
hard to purchase like I said I'm
big at purchasing at Sephora and also I
just am I love the point system movie IB
Anna platinum member like I just that's
just what I prefer I don't actually like
going into the Mac store we only have
one Mac store here where I live and just
every single time I've gone into Mac to
try to purchase something the customer
service has not been well for me and so
I just tend to stay away from it I have
purchased things from Mac before I have
a lipliner I have the fix+ and I have a
pigment those are the only things that I
own from Mac and it's just just not a
brand that I gravitate towards are
purchased from a lab that was kind of
like my biggest reason for for not doing
it also this line sold out at Mac super
quick like super super duper quick and
there's really not been a ton of makeup
products that I've like set an alarm for
or like felt the need to be on the
computer at the exact moment that it
releases I won't say I've never done it
because I have but majority ninety-five
percent of the time with makeup releases
I'm not setting an alarm or being on my
computer right away and this is another
one where I think if you weren't you
probably were not going to get it all so
a lot of different pieces in the
collection there's 14 different pieces
so it says there's three lipsticks five
eye shadows a blush and bronzer compact
a liquid liner and a mascara and you
know I kind of looked at the lipsticks
and the eyeshadows and things like that
they weren't colors that you know
necessarily I would gravitate towards
and you know that might be the same for
a lot of people but it's because you
know it's inspired by Selena and her
look and what she wore thought like
probably for me it's probably not
something that is totally gonna work I
wouldn't reach for it a lot the pieces
in the collection from what I'm seeing
online ranged from anywhere from
seventeen dollars to forty five dollars
at the time that I'm filming this I
actually can like really not find much
about the collection because once again
it is sold out everywhere it actually
said that it came to stores like Macy's
and Nordstrom and sold out within
minutes as well and peered at them these
anti hauls I tried to do research on the
products I'm gonna be talking about how
much they are what's included in them
where they're gonna be sold kind of the
feedback on them as well and as I was
researching this one kind of the main
story that I'm seeing
from it is how upset people are at how
fast it's selling out you know we don't
love I have makeup lovers we don't love
when products sell out so quickly like I
understand that people get excited when
things sell out and especially like
collabs that are a limited edition
everyone's like oh my gosh they sold out
they sold out they sold out that's great
and I'm sure that's fantastic but at the
same time you're making a lot of people
mad because it's frustrating when you
want something and you can't get it
especially if you go to like a physical
store because I have done that before
like oh this is gonna be in Sephora
today and you go at two o'clock in the
afternoon and they're like Luther oh
yeah we sold out at 10:30 it's like cool
it's frustrating so I get it but that
really was like the main headline that I
kept seeing when I was doing the
research for this product and especially
because you know Selena was so loved by
so many people that I'm sure there's a
lot of people out there that wanted to
purchase at least part of this
collection maybe just one lipstick from
the collection and they're having such a
hard time getting it so I get it I get
the frustrations I really do where any
of you able to get any of the Selena
collection or will you try again if it
comes out I also read that you know
they're supposed to be they're trying to
restock it they even say on the Mac
website we're trying to get it restocked
on Mac so more people can purchase it
but I read something that said the
collection will like completely ceased
on November 17th I'm pretty sure the
date was so just so you guys know if you
are trying to get the collection keep
that date in mind because apparently
after that there will be no more
production on it so for all those
reasons that I just listed I won't be
purchasing the Mac and Selena collection
I want to talk about is from Tarte
cosmetics it's their pretty paint box
I believe it's what's called pretty pink
box yes this thing looks mind-blowing so
first I do want to say that I loved her
I purchased from Tarte very frequently a
purchase from tart on Sephora if there's
something I really want that's only on
the Tarte website I purchased from Tarte
like that's one of the very few brands
that I purchased from they have their
own like loyalty program there you can
typically always find some sort of
discount with them they have fast
shipping I've had really good customer
service with Tarte so that is actually a
brand that I don't feel the absolute
urge to go was Sephora or Alta so this
one was like really painful for me to
decide that I'm not
get it because this set looks freaking
bomb I'm not gonna lie you guys this
looks bomb and I was like I really do
want it but I'm holding back but let me
tell you guys about it because it's out
it does sound really cool alright so
include it in the tart pretty paint box
you get 24 shimmer and matte eyeshadows
two bronzers a blush a highlight a
mascara and eyeliner and a lip gloss and
it's all for $59 I will insert insert
some pictures here I'll probably insert
a couple along the way to show you guys
everything this looks like literally
like everything that you need all
wrapped up in a pretty paint box like
how crazy is that a couple reasons why I
am holding back from it honestly my
biggest reason is price and while I say
that $59 is a good steal I definitely do
think it is but around the holiday time
pin this in my will I buy it too around
the holiday time is when me personally
like I start tightening up finances
because I have a lot of people that I
need to buy Christmas gifts for there's
a lot that I need to do around the
holiday season we travel and it's just
not feasible for me to just be
constantly spending money on makeup it's
just not I wish it was and I wish I
could you know buy more but I truly
can't I also host giveaways on YouTube
on Instagram constantly so I'm trying to
buy for you guys a lot to say thank you
which means that I necessarily can't buy
for myself and you know what that's fine
to me I don't need every single release
out there I would much rather be able to
say thank you to you guys and hopefully
be able to grow and keep growing and you
know maybe one day I'll get noticed by
target maybe they'll send me a cool PR
package you know that's what I would
rather do and where I would rather spend
my money I would also really love to
invest and like lighting because as of
still I'm still only using natural light
to film which means my filming hours are
very very limited especially as we come
up to the winter so I've been saving
really hard to get a nice lighting set
which is another reason why I've been
tightening the finances and not buying
everything I'm an author I have two
books coming out I have a holiday
novella coming out very soon and my
fifth novel will be published soon I
have to pay for editing for proofreading
for cover design for formatting for
marketing for sending out giveaway
copies you know things like that
hobbies descend to my family as well
that's very expensive and I got to
coming up within the next couple of
months here so for all of those reasons
that's kind of like the biggest reason
that I'm not going for this one because
this one really did excite me I thought
I just I really do want to get it but I
also know that I have to be practical
that's really honestly the main reason
why I'm not purchasing the Tarte one it
also will be limited edition because it
is one of their holiday sets and like I
said I try not to go for a limited
edition but like the mascara that's in
there that's not limited edition I think
like the lip gloss that's in there I
think it's one of their regular lip
glosses not limited edition so there's a
lot of things inside that you get that
are not simply limited edition just kind
of like the case as a whole as a part of
their holiday release which is limited
edition but again kind of like the
biggest feature I think for this is the
24-hour shadows and like I've mentioned
not a huge eye shadow person like maybe
if this was just like the blush and the
highlight palette and then the lip gloss
and the mascara I would actually maybe
be like me maybe I will go for that and
I do need to check out I want to look
more at the Tarte holiday releases
because I know they got a lot of
different things going on I have them on
my list to research and check out and I
will probably feature that in my next
will I buy it because I'm trying to make
my will I buy it's more focused on all
holiday sets this one is just kind of
all over the place this might be the
only like true holiday release that I'm
talking about in here
but it's been one of the most asked so I
wanted to include it right away instead
of waiting for my next one where I'll
probably include more Tarte products so
if you guys want to see more tart in my
next will I buy it please do leave that
in the comments below but I'll have to
look out and see what else they have out
there maybe there's something else that
would work better for me because like I
said tarts one of my favorite brands I
really do like purchasing from them it
just for the reasons that I mentioned
I'm gonna pass on the pretty paint box
so you can get this palette add the
Tarte website of course and then it's
also exclusive to Sephora so it won't be
anywhere else besides tart and Sephora
so if you guys needed that information
there it is but I wanted to touch on the
pretty pink box because I was getting
asked a lot of questions about it and
unfortunately I'm gonna have to say no
one last product to talk about and it is
actually another
they released so sorry another holiday
release in here I actually thought tart
was gonna be where I cut it off but I'm
gonna talk about one more I think we can
fit it in hopefully I didn't just make
this video too long but a lot of people
recently have started questioning me on
the new Anastasia Beverly Hills ultimate
glow kit so Anastasia has come out with
quite a few of her glow kits I own to
myself I owned that glow and I also own
sweets she's been coming out with a lot
of different really amazing glow kits
and she has releasing one for the 2016
holiday season in ultimate glow this
includes six highlighter shades they all
look to be like very metallic shades and
they range from there's like a white one
which I believe is called snow and then
it goes like darker and then like the
last shade looks to be like pretty dark
so this set for the six different
highlighters is going to be $45 hurt the
other glow kits that I have each have
four highlight pans in them they were
$40 so really $45 is not a bad price now
obviously it's an anti haul so you guys
know that I'm not going to be purchasing
this so I'll let you know why like I
said I do have two of her other glow
kids and I do use them frequently but I
don't use every single shade in them
which I knew when I was buying them you
know not every single shade is gonna
work out for me or work out for my skin
tone show up on me might be too dark etc
etc especially with sweets because
that's a very kind of like different
glow kit it has a lot of unique colors
in there but I was like you know what I
don't have anything like this I want to
purchase it so I did but knowing that I
wouldn't use every single shade and this
ultimate glow kid I'm like you know I've
already talked about the money reasons
and the holidays are coming up I'm like
I probably don't need to spend $45 on
this when I'll probably realistically
only use like two shades in here a lot I
do feel like with highlighters you can
use them as like eyeshadows I've done
that with my other glow kits as well so
you can kind of mix them up and use them
for different things but I just you know
I don't think that I would utilize all
six shades I'd probably only get really
use out of like two maybe three of them
so it's like you know is it really worth
it I have some of the other glow kids I
think this would be a cool collector's
item like if you're getting all the glow
kids like yeah go ahead and spend the
$45 and get
just one two and have it be a
collector's item that's awesome but I've
also talked about how I try not to
purchase a lot of limited-edition people
get so mad when I use limited edition in
my tutorials and you know what it's like
it's okay I can live without this cloak
it also I you know I don't know what
this glow cave is gonna be like but when
I purchased me that glow I've had no
troubles with it no issues with it had
it shipped my house everything was fine
when I ordered the sweets glow kit I had
ordered four and all of them came broken
so I ordered two right away one for
myself one for a giveaway they both came
broken I called some customer service
they sent me two more and both came
broken and I'm like okay so that's duck
so I'm just not really excited to
purchase another glow kid because I'm
afraid they're just all gonna come
shattered and then even after I called
the second time when I got the second
package and I was like they still are
coming broken they were like oh well
we're out of stock so we can't do
anything for you I'm like cool okay so
nice I tried to like take the like
rubbing alcohol method which I'd never
done before I try to do that with the
sweets kid and it kind of ended up a hot
mess and I'm still really upset about it
I don't use the sweets that much because
it's hard to show it on camera I do show
it in my highlighter collection but it's
hard showing on camera too because they
just look weird like the rubbing alcohol
method did not work for me I don't know
I probably won't do it again because I
feel like it just made the highlighters
weird it was messy it was time-consuming
I didn't have the patience for it so I'm
just afraid that I'm gonna spend $45 get
this glow kit it's gonna come shatter it
again and I'm gonna be like cool not
what do I do like I don't know I'm not
saying that I'm never going to buy
another glow kid from Anastacio because
I do like them it's just I'm still
feeling I'm still feeling the bitterness
right now over the sweet smell and some
like you know what I'm trying to save
money right now anyways so I don't need
to do it but it does look really cool
I'm not gonna lie like the colors look
really amazing from the pictures that
I've seen I've seen a couple swatches so
far looks really cool so I'm curious
like are you guys gonna get this one are
you interested in it will you spend the
$45 on the six shades let me know I'm
curious about it it's just not gonna be
for me thing for my latest anti holo
what you guys think I hope you enjoyed
it
you know like I said hopefully you can
tell from the anti howl like this isn't
a negative video in any sort of way not
bashing company is not saying I don't
like companies anything like that I'm
just giving my opinions on new releases
and why I won't be purchasing them you
know a lot of it right now is financial
reasons like I mentioned in the will I
buy it when holiday season comes around
like I'm the person who was like no I
don't need groceries because I'm gonna
buy something from my mom like that's
just how I am and I feel like in the
beauty community people are like who
needs grab tres I want to buy that
eyeshadow palette I also explained about
limited edition certain products not
speaking to me and you know I prefer
just to be really real with you guys
like that's just who I am and that's why
I want to continue to be on YouTube and
I'll be real with you and tell you if I
think things are too expensive or you
know something just doesn't speak to me
or brand doesn't speak to me or things
like that and you know it's just me
being me me giving my honest opinions

me because I've been having so much fun
filming days like literally if I could

would and I'm trying to space them out a
little bit I'll probably do a couple
more though in a shorter timeframe

holiday releases as I can so let me know

see next for my Willa bias for my anti
hauls let me know what you're wondering
