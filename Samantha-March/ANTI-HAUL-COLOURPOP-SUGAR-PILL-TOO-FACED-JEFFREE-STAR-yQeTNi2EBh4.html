today's video is going to be a new anti
haul video so I'm going to be going over
some and makeup releases that I will and
not to be purchasing used to do anti
hauls and then I switched it to just my
wilai bias I post my will I bite videos
every Wednesday where I talk about will
I buy new makeup releases it's funny
when I started bringing back the anti
house some people said to me like yes I
still like great to house but it's not
us like dramatic watching like as you
talk about a product are you gonna buy
it we just know you're not gonna buy it
but the anti house would really
requested to bring back so I'm gonna try
to share them about once or twice a
month but like I said I do post my
bullet videos every single Wednesday I
have a will I buy it
/ anti haul playlist I can link that
link down below if you're interested in
checking them out but I like making
these types of videos and just being
able to talk about new makeup releases
without feeling the pressure to buy
everything but then just kind of showing
that kind of what goes into the decision
of what I'm gonna spend my money on
makeup wise you know what I think I need
what I don't need things like that I
just enjoy watching these types of
videos and so I like making them as well
thank you for requesting to bring the
anti hauls back I do appreciate it but I
do post four times a week so like I said
Wednesday's are my willand buying videos
and then I post on Thursdays Sundays and
Mondays so I hope that you will hit the
subscribe button so you'll become a part
of the YouTube fam and get notified when
I post a future videos but if you would
like to see the most recent batch of
makeup that I will not be buying please
keep watching so first up I have the
colour-pop Valentine's Day collection to
talk about a lot of people have been
asking me if I'm purchasing anything
from this collection or what I think
about it they have pressed eyeshadow
duo's that are ten dollars each
they have a short and sweet mini kit
which is $18 they have new lippie stix
with a new cream finish which are five
dollars each they have six new super
shock shadow shades available
individually for five dollars or as a
set of four for 18 I believe it is a new
tie-dye highlighter which is eight
dollars they also have some brushes
color pop is pretty new tip brushes I
don't have any of them yet but they have
a blending and shader brush which are
six dollars each and an angled eyeliner
brush for five dollars
I think that's everything from the
Valentine's Day collection I'm looking
at the trend mood one Instagram page as
I am talking about this so you know I
like color pop I have a lot from
colour-pop I enjoy buying from
colour-pop but sometimes color pop is
just a little bit too overwhelming for
me every time you blink they have a new
collection coming out they're
collaborating with someone new they have
new shades they have new formulas
they've new something and it just kind
of like makes my head spin so I feel
like I kind of go in waves with color
pop like I buy a lot from them and then
I don't buy anything at all and then I
buy a lot from them and then I don't buy
anything at all and right now I'm in the
don't buy anything at all I've just
gotten a couple items recently from
colour-pop a new eyeshadow a new
lipstick another new lipstick oh I
bought the the peachy lip bundle so I've
been I've been getting some new stuff
from them so right now I kind of feel
like I'm in my don't buy anything from
colour-pop kind of phase and I don't
know just looking at this I mean
especially like those eyeshadow duos and
there appears to be of what looks like a
lip kit with many lip kits I mean I I
don't know I don't mean to like draw
speculation but I know a lot of people
talk about it anyways but do those
Valentine's releases now look exactly
like Kylie cosmetics and her Valentine's
releases like when I saw them I was like
wait a second is AI Kylie cosmetics is
that color pop which how which one which
one is that I don't really know the deal
with Kylie cosmetics in color pop I've
watched some videos on it I've heard
some people say things and at all I
don't really know I don't really
purchase from Kylie cosmetics a lot
either I can't really think of the last
time I made a purchase from her so I
don't know but I just think it's weird
like I just I don't I don't know I just
think it's weird but that really has
nothing to do with my decision of not to
buy it like I said I'm just I'm just
kind of in that do not buy anything from
colour-pop right now and I don't feel
super bad about it I mean it's not
expensive like if you're looking for an
inexpensive Valentine's Day collection
or if you wanted to get stuff from
Kylie's Valentine's collection and you
missed it maybe purchase from colour-pop
and save a couple of dollars but right
now I just don't really have any
interest in it
we'll see they also did another recent
collab I'm not sure I can't remember off
the top of my head who that was with but
I'm sure by the time I finished filming
this video that they'll already have a
new collection announced our new
collaboration announced so I think I'm
okay to skip over the Valentine set from
colour-pop I said right now I'm just in
the I don't need to buy anything from
colour-pop right now I just you know got
got quite a few items some of them so
I'm okay to pass over the Valentine's
Day collection but let us know in the
comments down below did you get anything
from the colour-pop collection what do
you think of it or will you be
purchasing from it
Oh next up I was tagged on Instagram to
talk about this this is the feline fancy
set from sugarpill and inside there's an
eyeshadow palette with four different
shades and then you also get a liquid
lipstick which is in a deep metallic
oxblood red with sparkle so this limited
edition and it is $48 so I thought this
was interesting and I wanted to talk
about it because I've never purchased
anything from sugarpill and I actually
am NOT super familiar with sugarpill so
I wanted to kind of get your guys's
feedback because anyone purchased the
feline side or do you have anything from
sugarpill
anything that you would really recommend
or anything that you would suggest
passing on it's just a brand that I'm
not super familiar with I was looking at
the trend moon Instagram it says it is
online at Beauty lish as well I hear
good things about Beauty lish I've never
made a purchase from Beauty lotion
myself but I see that you can purchase
this set on there also but I just don't
have anything from sugarpill but I'm
curious about the brand I'm always open
to trying new things but I never have
and sometimes when I haven't tried a
brand yet I'm just a little bit more
hesitant to purchase something because I
just don't know anything about them yet
you know that's kind when I like to get
your guys's feedback and see what you
guys think in the comments because
sometimes it helps me find find new
brands to try but regardless of not
purchasing from sugarpill yet this is
limited edition which immediately I
don't try to buy a lot of limited
edition because it's harder than down
the road when I'm talking about it or
doing a tutorial what they people can
get upset because they weren't able to
get it or it's not stock anymore so I
try not to buy a limited edition too
much I don't not purchase anything
Limited Edition because that's not
possible but I just tried to limit
myself and what I'm buying that's
limited edition
it's $48 so that's a little bit more
expensive to me for for shadow shades
and a lipstick also for eyeshadow shades
there's like a red in there that are
probably wouldn't use too much like it
just the four shades that it comes with
doesn't really seem like that much to me
or something that I would use on a very
regular basis so to spend 48 dollars on
an eyeshadow palette with a lipstick to
know that I'm not going to get a lot of
use out of it that just isn't a smart
purchase for me like if these are your
shades and you think like I'm gonna wear
that palette so often like I'm gonna get
a ton of use on it maybe I'll even hit
pan on one of the shades I'm sure
totally that makes sense but for me I'm
like uh I would maybe use like the brown
shade out of here but the other shades
just don't don't really speak to me and
then the liquid lipstick is like nothing
like I would wear on a daily basis or
any sort of regular basis it's a
metallic oxblood red with sparkle I
don't really wear Reds a lot I have some
metallic lips I have one metallic lip -
- metallic lips I have some metallic
lips but I don't wear them a ton usually
it's just for something fun or tutorial
or a video or something like that but
like going out I'm wearing my nudes I
just I wouldn't get enough use out of
this collection so I'll just spend 48
dollars on it it just doesn't make any
sense
I mean honestly to spend eight dollars
on it it doesn't make the most sense
because I'm just not gonna wear it it's
just not the shades for me so I'm not
going to purchase the sugarpill feline
fancy set which is also their
Valentine's Day collection I believe but
I'm curious are you guys going to or
what else do you have from sugarpill
that you could recommend or not
recommend I would love to know as always
thank you for tagging me on Instagram
and sending in your comments that really
helps me out when I go to make these
videos because I like to talk about what
you guys are curious about so please
keep doing that yeah sugar pail feeling
fancy said it's gonna be a no-go for me
okay guys so everybody has been asking
me about the Too Faced highlighters like
everybody has been asking me but I've
been being asked about the Too Faced
highlighters when we just got like a
peak that highlighters were coming and
then when we got a peek at the packaging
people are still asking me I know I know
like I'm getting asked a lot of
questions right now there's a lot of
like youtuber collabs coming up
Casey Holmes Jaclyn hill Nicole Guerrero
and everybody's asking me about them but
we haven't actually really seen
everything yet from those questions that
I just spoke up we haven't really seen
like what's inside or what all the
shades look like or something like that
so I don't want to talk about things
until I can actually see them and I can
make a better opinion on them but I'm
just saying that people have been asking
me about these highlighters for so long
and I can finally talk about them
because we're finally seeing that I'm
seeing the inside seeing the swatches we
have prices we know what's going on so
the two-faced highlighters it's a part
of their summer 2017 collection at the
highlights are $30 each and they are
permanent permanent items make me so
excited so there's blinded by the light
which is a light highlighter with silver
packaging ray of light as a light pink
highlighter with metallic pink packaging
and you light up my life as a gold
highlighter with gold packaging the
packaging is super interesting I saw
someone comment and say that it looked
like the the heart from Titanic the
heart necklace why can't I think I
should know what that's called right
everybody knows what that's called nope
it's not coming to me but you guys you
definitely know what I'm talking about
you know what I'm talking about and it
does and it looks huge like I don't have
the size yet of how much product you get
into it but every single photo that I've
seen these highlighters look gigantic so
I guess for 30 dollars for a single
highlight I hope that they're gigantic
because that's a lot of money for a
highlight I compared to like the
Anastacio glow kits where you're getting
four shades for $40 and this one you're
spending $30 on one highlight so
obviously they're in the in the anti
haul video so I'm not buying them
probably I guess the main reason is that
it's $30 from one highlight that's very
expensive to me and I don't wear a
highlight on a daily basis anymore I
used to love highlight like when the
highlight craze was like really
happening I was all about it I was
buying the highlights like crazy but I
suffer from a lot of texture I've been
trying to change up my skincare routine
and find a good skincare product that
helps to deal with the texture because
especially when I wear a highlight like
I like wearing highlight I have
right now I like wearing highlight I
think it's very pretty but when all it
does is show the texture on my
cheekbones it's like ooh I don't want to
wear the highlights so that's kind of
like my biggest thing is when I'm going
to be spending more money on products if
I'm going to be buying something
higher-end or luxury I want to be buying
something that I know I'm gonna get a
really good you saw those like you know
not saying that I have to have wear it
on a daily basis but I want to regularly
wear it and highlight is just not that
for me the highlight purchase for me
just isn't a good purchase I'm just not
gonna get enough use out of it and to
spend $30 on this the glow highlighter
it's just too much money for me if
you're a highlight junkie if you
absolutely love highlight if you're
dying over this packaging if you're a
hardcore toothpaste fan yeah should I
get it like buy it but I'm none of those
things so it doesn't make sense for me
I've also just I don't know I'm still
feeling saucy about to face you guys and
I feel like I've been saying this in a
couple of my will i buy it videos
talking about the new releases from Too
Faced but I don't know I'm just I'm just
not very happy with them lately the
whole white chocolate chip palette just
just didn't make a lot of sense to me
I'm just not completely on the Too Faced
reign these days which makes me sad
because they were one of my favorite
brands and I'm not sure I know that they
sold to Estee Lauder and that's been
going on just I'm not really I'm not
really feeling them at this moment
there's a lot of other brands and I'm
still totally riding on their train on
new brands that I'm trying to discover
so I think I'm gonna continue to lay off
to face for for a little bit I think I
am I don't know that's just my personal
opinion I'm not trying to like hash
anybody here and I'm sure to face isn't
like crying because I'm not gonna
purchase from them because they have a
bazillion fans out there so it's just
kind of like my personal preference so
I'm going to continue to decline from
buying from Too Faced and that's going
to include their new highlighters the
packaging looks cool to highlight the
swatches that I've seen they look cool
but it's just a little bit too much
money for me for a product that I won't
use on a regular basis and from a brand
that I'm in a complicated relationship
with at the moment the last item to talk
about in the
anteye hull is going to be from jeffree
star cosmetics and it is the androgyny
palette so this palette is gonna be
available on March 4th at 10 a.m. PST
the palette includes 10 shades and the
pan sizes are very large and then it's
going to be $45 looks like there's a
really like kind of like a very wide
range of colors in here it's kind of
like a colorful palette but somehow yet
still neutral fish at the same time just
from the picture that I'm looking at so
definitely looks like an interesting
palette um
actually talked about jeffree star
cosmetics in my very first anti hell
video that I did and I just kind of
mentioned that I'm just not a fan of
Jeffrey star and I choose not to support
his brand because of that I think I
started following Jeffrey star at a bad
time I was hearing more I think maybe it
was around like the beauty killer is his
other palette I think maybe it was
around the time of that release that I
started following him and watching him
just like I deal with a lot of other
makeup brands started following him on
snapchat and within two days of me
following him he went on this crazy rant
and just the language that was being
used and things that were being said was
such a complete turnoff to me and just I
don't know to me it was just
unprofessional you know to be in this
industry and to be doing that I just I
didn't really love it and I know that
there's a lot of opinions out there
about Jeffrey star and I know some of
you are gonna get really mad at me that
I say that I don't choose to support
Jeffrey star and that's totally fine
because we all get to make our own
opinions and we all get to support who
we want to support and things like that
and he's just someone who I decided not
to I really I just didn't enjoy his
snapchats and what he had to say and
sometimes I feel like the message that
he's promoting every once in a while I
go back in and you know I try to watch
his snaps and I'll try to watch a video
just to see you know like maybe
something's changed her maybe his brain
is gonna come up with something that I
feel like I really need and maybe I
should you know change my mind but I
haven't yet I haven't really seen
anything that's made me really want to
be a supporter so that's just my
personal opinion that's my personal
preference
and I get to make it because that's the
world that we live in so you get to make
your own opinions and you get to like
and support and follow and buy from
people at brands that you want to so I
know I've been getting a lot of
questions asked on the androgyny palette
and I'm not gonna buy it
it's $45 for an eyeshadow palette not
eyeshadow palette junkie it is more
expensive the colors inside I probably
want to get a lot of use out of anyways
but regardless I mean anything Jeffery
star I'm not buying at this moment in
time now saying there won't be a time in
the future where I do change my mind or
something happens and I decide to
support him and his brand good happen I
don't know at this time I'm not even in
a complicated relationship with a Jerry
star cosmetics I've just a no
relationship and you know what he's
probably fine with that too I mean it's
just like two-faced he's not over there
crying because one girl is not gonna buy
his collection because he's got a lot of
fans and supporters out there which is
super fantastic a lot of you guys have
been asking me to chat about that one so
I just wanted to kind of briefly touch
on it I don't try to make like super
negative videos and like bash people or
anything like that it's just like I said
it's just personal preference I don't
know how many times I can say that but I
just know from the first day into hell
video that I did and things that I
talked about people were like so super
mad at me and like trying to change my
mind and things like that but that's
okay that's alright I just know that a
lot of you guys wouldn't ask me about
that in drogyny palette so I wanted to
make sure that I included it in here but
that is going to be the last item that
I'm talking about for this anti haul all
right guys that's gonna be everything
for this anti haul video I've almost
lost my lighting only like four o'clock
