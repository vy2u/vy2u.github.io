today's video is going to be a new anti
haul video or makeup that I will not be
buying I do anti hauls about once a
month these were created by Kimberly
Clark so I will have her channel listed
down below she's kind of like the
originator of the anti haul I did a
couple anti hauls and then I kind of put
my own spin on the idea and I do the
will i buy it wednesday series where
every single wednesday i post a will i
buy it video and i'm just talking about
no makeup releases and if i will buy
them or not and kind of giving my
opinions and feedback and that was kind
of inspired from these anti haul videos
and then even though those videos like
people seem to really enjoy them i think
there are my most popular videos on my
channel i was still getting requests to
do anti hauls so i do these once a month
like I said I do have a will I buy it
slash anti haul playlist so I'll leave
that link down below in case you guys
are interested but in addition to my
will I buy at Wednesdays I also post on
Thursday's Sundays and Mondays so you do
get videos from me four times a week so
if you have not subscribed yet I hope
that you will subscribe and get notified
for future videos I also do have a
really really large 15k giveaway going
on right now so that will be linked in
the description box down below make sure
you go check out that video see all the
crazy prizes and get entered but if
you'd like to see you my latest EJ haul
and the makeup that I will not be buying
please keep watching so let's start off
with some luxury makeup which just means
like judging judging so I've been
getting asked some questions about the
Tom Ford the Soleil summer 2017
collection okay so I'm looking at the
trend mood one Instagram page it says
there is a bronzer that you say it's a
really large bronzer apparently but it's
a hundred and ten dollars for a bronzer
I love bronzing I love it I love bronzer
little contour I love it all but no not
for one hundred and ten dollars like I
know that it's just it's just too
expensive man like I struggle to spend
that much money on makeup I really do
there's also a Soleil contouring compact
it's a face palette that includes a
blush a highlighter in a bronzer again
it's supposed to be really big it's 108
dollars no I appreciate that
this one you get different types of
shades you know the blush the bronze are
the highlight for the 108 but still
that's just that's just too much money
for me there's also a lip balm which is
$36 no I don't need a lip balm for $36
no I don't need any of this I'll put
some photos in here down below like I do
my Willett bio my Intel video so you
guys can see what I'm talking about
I guess they mean yeah they look large
but I can't justify spending that kind
of money I know there's so many people
out there that love luxury makeup and
that's what they want to spend their
money on but that is not what I want to
spend my money on so I'm gonna pass over
the Tom Ford summer Soleil collection
just because of price like I'm sure
it'll be beautiful and wonderful and
fantastic but I just can't do it to
myself so let us know in the comments
down below are you gonna pick up
anything from this collection are you
like a Tom Ford fanatic I would love to
know I got asked a couple questions
about an a collaboration between cake
face beauty and beauty influencer Kim
Thai they're coming out with some lashes
are it really they're already out that
came out March 15th and a new affordable
lash style in lion-hearted so I actually
don't really I don't follow up Kim Thai
I haven't seen any of your videos I saw
her once in a video with nikkietutorials
I think they are really close friends
but she's not someone who I follow
myself let me know what let me know in
the comments down below do is this
someone who like I absolutely have to
watch I'd love to know and I've actually
never purchased anything from cake face
Beauty I'm not very familiar with them
so even though I really love lashes I'm
gonna pass over the lion-hearted lashes
yeah
Lionheart lashes I'm gonna pass over
these I just got a lot of lashes I got
all six of the new pure lashes that came
out a wonderful friend
que Bella beauties that made the Koko
lashes and Queen B and like I just buy
lashes all the time like I just you know
you go to the drugstore for toothpaste
and you come out with five sets of our
doll whispies and you're like what did I
get toothpaste I don't even know so I
just um I don't think I need these I
don't see a price on them right now
other than it just does a portion will
go to charity but now these aren't for
me but did you get these lashes
collaboration with Kim tight or will you
put them up let us know color pop has
another collection out I just talked
about color pop in my last will i buy it
video and they came out with a
monochromatic collection in pink they
apparently also have a monoclinic
collection with nectar and there's a
pressed powder blush and a highlighter I
think maybe there's like a shadows too
yeah so there's the knock out palette
with a blush and highlighter there's
super shock cheek shades super shock
shadows for pressed eyeshadows and ultra
satin lip alipio stick to lip pencils I
mean everything from a color pop is
always super affordable and fantastic
but like I said in last week's bill I
buy a video they just come out with
collections too fast they make my head
spin
they make me not really want to get it
because it's like I don't know it just
you know like when a makeup brand is
gonna release something and I haven't
really something in a while and you're
like oh my gosh I'm so excited I can't
wait for this product to come out but
then there's color properly releases
something like every four days and
you're like well whatever if I don't get
that one they're gonna come out with
something next week so I can just save
my money and like wait that's what I
feel when it comes to color pop I know a
lot of people will say the same things
in the comments down below it's just too
much it's too overwhelming it truly
makes me question how good is their
products like how good can the quality
actually be I know now there's whispers
of they're just taking older products
and repackaging them and giving them new
names and we're not actually getting new
stuff I don't know but I'm just saying
they come out with way too much stuff
too fast is too overwhelming I'm I'm not
on colourpop's train right now I get in
times where like I buy so much from
colour-pop and then I scale way back
because I'm like whoa I just bought a
lot of color pop and all this is going
to be discontinued in two months
great let us know in the comments down
below did you already get these are you
still planning on getting some from the
nectar collection I always love to know
some questions on the new face brush set
by Wayne Goss there's one two three four
five six different brushes I believe
each brush is made in Japan by more than
twenty artisans using traditional brush
making techniques it's two hundred and
fifty dollars it's permanent and it's
sold as a set
now I cannot spend $250 from makeup
brushes I just can't I just I can't do
it I've never tried anything from Wayne
Goss I recently started watching his
YouTube videos because I find them
pretty interesting but I don't know $250
for six brushes they look really
beautiful and I appreciate that it takes
all these people and there's brush
making techniques happening I I get that
and that's really wonderful and I'm sure
a lot of people are gonna buy these
brushes so that's fantastic but I'm not
gonna be one of them again it's just
it's too expensive and I just don't feel
like I need them right now and my brush
collection needs serious help I need to
declutter it I need to find a better way
to organize my brushes because they are
freaking disaster right now but I just
don't need this one but let us know are
you going to get these new Wayne Goss
brushes I have some highlights that I
will not be buying one is from NARS
the trend mood said it's they're
narcissists bunk disable highlighting
palette okay it's $49 it has three
different shades in it it looks
beautiful like the packaging looks super
beautiful but I do not need any more
highlights like the reason I'm not
buying any of these highlights is
because I don't need any more I have
just purchased so many highlights that
my highlight collection is like has like
a stop sign up like please don't add
anything more to us we can't handle it
so I'm not gonna be getting that NARS
highlight and other highlights that I
was asked about is from ciate it's
called their dewy stick it says this is
a luminous highlighting balm it kind of
reminds me a little bit of like the
benefit Watts up highlighter like it's
kind of like that stick form and that's
just kind of what I thought at first
it's gonna be $26 which isn't that's the
price I guess but I just don't need it
and especially because it reminds me of
the benefit what's up and I have that I
just I don't need it I don't need any
highlights right now I just don't need
any and then another highlight that I'm
not buying is from a Lime Crime it's the
holographic Beauty highlight opals
highlighter palette includes three
unicorn shades it's 38 dollars it should
already be on sale right now I'll leave
anything that I can find and so on
stocke I'll leave it all linked down
below I've never purchased from Lime
Crime I actually was like getting ready
to make a purchase from Lime Crime like
a year or so ago two years ago and then
there was almost like controversy
stealing card numbers and all this
craziness that happened so I didn't make
my purchase of course and then I just
kind of never never really thought about
it again I feel like I don't hear a lot
of people talk about Lime Crime except
for when they have negative things
Desai's so I don't know I guess I just I
don't hear the best thing and the
swatches look kind of cool but again I
just seriously I just don't need any
highlights that's why I'm not buying
this so I'm cream palette is another one
that I will not beginning but what do
you think does your highlight game need
some help right now or are you just a
highlight junkie and if you see a
highlight and you want it you just go
get it because that's how you roll let
us know in the comments down below what
you think of these highlights and if
you're picking any up so the last two
items um one is a foundation that people
who are curious funds gonna buy from
Giorgio Armani it's their power fabric
along where high cover foundation it is
$64 for one ounce of product that's a
lot of money actually been watching
review videos on it because for some
reason I thought like oh maybe I could
get this funding I don't know why I
don't know why I thought maybe I could
get this foundation but I started
watching review videos and it just looks
okay and for $64 I'm gonna need more
than okay I don't own a lot of high-end
foundations I do on the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer it's
one of my favorites that also I believe
as an ounce of product that you're
getting but it was like $28 or something
it was super affordable and I got during
the vib sale which made it even cheaper
have so many foundations that I love and
I love drugstore foundations L'Oreal
Maybelline I'm a big fan of their
foundations I have what do I have on
today I have a NYX foundation on today I
just really like drugstore foundations
so if I like them that much it just
doesn't make sense to me to buy a lot of
higher-end foundations when I think the
drugstore works just fine
like I don't prefer drugstore mascaras
I like the higher-end mascaras it's not
just like oh drugstores just more
affordable they're always going to you
know be better I can always justify
spending less money that's not true
because I own majority high-end mascaras
because I just prefer them I don't like
the drugstore as much but what
foundations it's completely flipped
I prefer drafts or foundations to higher
ed foundations so that's just kind of
how I am so I'm not gonna buy it like I
said I was watching in the review videos
and it just a lot of people are like
it's okay it's good and on my gift uh
I'm gonna I'm gonna need a little bit
more than that
so I'm gonna pass over the Giorgio
Armani fabric foundation but of course
let us know do you love Giorgio Armani
are you gonna give this one a go let us
know in the comments so the last item
that I want to talk about is a
collaboration between jeffree star
cosmetics in mani MUA
who is a beauty influencer so their
collaboration includes two velour liquid
lipsticks in one skin frost which is a
powder highlighter I don't see a date
yet I'm looking at the trend would one
Instagram page I don't see a date yet
and I actually don't think I've even
seen swatches of this yet it says it's
just coming in April so far we've just
seen like the outer packaging if
swatches have come in I am trying to pre
film because I'm going on a vacation and
filming earlier than I normally would so
maybe if some swatches have come out I
can put it in here as well but I don't
need swatches and they don't need a
price to know that I won't be purchasing
this I talked about Jeffrey's are my
last anti haul video I'm just not a
supporter of his I don't feel the need
to buy his products I don't think like
you know with certain like youtubers cuz
Jeffrey star is also a youtuber and then
has a brand as well you know there's
just some people that like you just
don't vibe with and like I don't know
that's definitely me and Jeffrey star
but it's also me and Manny anyway I
really tried watching his videos and I
don't him on snapchat and then I don't I
don't really know what to say I just I
didn't really like anything that I was
seeing and then even was it just last
week someone left a comment on my
youtube video about a camera member she
said she was watching Manny snapchat or
she saw it on someone else's channel
that Manny was saying in a snapchat that
I don't some brand sent him a PR package
and it didn't include like the whole
collection and that he was saying that
he should receive the whole collection I
don't know
all this stuff like I don't want to say
word for word because I didn't watch it
I didn't see it so I don't know but that
comment came through and like actually
kind of made me a little bit sick to my
stomach because I just entitlement is
just not a cute thing at all and it just
laughs so that kind of like solidified
to me even more that you know we just
don't get along I don't really like
talking or being negative and I feel
like I'm like being awkward because I
don't love it but that's just my
thoughts and my feelings and I know I
mean a lot of people come after me when
I talk about how I'm not gonna buy from
Jeffrey star that's my opinion and
that's my right if I don't want to buy
makeup I'm not gonna buy the makeup and
I mean it doesn't make me a bad person
it doesn't make you a bad person if you
buy the makeup like it's just makeup and
I always say in like my will i buy it
videos like this is a judgment-free zone
it's the same thing with the inside
halls I'm not here to judge anybody if
you love a certain person to like if you
love Jeffery and you love Manny and you
can't wait for this collection and
you're gonna set your alarm and buy it
that's fantastic and I hope that you
love it
now it just it kind of like weirds me
out how strange people get over this
kind of stuff you know a lot of
different things in life weird me out
too so I don't know there's that but
this part I feel like it's just so
awkward for me to do because I don't
like being negative but I just don't
really like Jeffrey star and I really
have never really liked me anyway
never just got the feel for them like I
do some other youtubers we just I just
our personalities don't mesh I guess but
that's why I'm gonna be skipping over
this collaboration so I don't need the
swatches I don't need the price I know
for sure that it's not something that I
will be picking up a but let me know in
the comments down below are you gonna
get this one or are you going to pass
over it but after that that's going to
do it for my monthly anti haul here so
that's gonna be everything for this
month's anti haul video I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video or
found it helpful or interesting or just
entertaining in some ways I know some
people seem to take the infidel videos
like super seriously and that was a big
reason why I switched it up and went to
the will i buy it videos because I just
felt like maybe they couldn't be
construed as
negatively as anti hoes are but I still
like to film these at least once a month
because they do get requested on my
channel but like I said it's a
no-judgment zone it's just makeup and
you know you get to do what you want to
do and I get to do what I want to do and
we all should hopefully live happily
ever after so did you guys enjoy the
video or found it entertaining and
helpful in some ways I like to watch the
anti help videos because sometimes
people bring up like a good points I
didn't think of when I was thinking
about buying makeup or I learned
something new or it just stops me to
like think for a minute like do I really
need that and you know is that gonna be
a good buy it just it helps me sometimes
definitely from spending money where I
don't necessarily need it and then
having buyers regret enjoy watching the
anti haul videos as well so I hope that
you guys liked this one if you did
