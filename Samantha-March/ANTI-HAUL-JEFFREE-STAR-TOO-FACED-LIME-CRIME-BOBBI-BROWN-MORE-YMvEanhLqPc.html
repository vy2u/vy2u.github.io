today's video is going to be a new ante
hall I post my dental health videos
about once a month where I'm talking
about some makeup that I will and not be
purchasing and giving my reasons for why
I am NOT making those purchases
I do also post at least four times a
week so on Wednesdays I post my lilia by
eight series which is kind of a spin-off
to the anti haul I'll have my playlist
linked down below I also post on
Thursdays Sundays and Mondays I
livestream on it Tuesdays at 4:00 CST
tails I've been throwing into some bonus
videos on Fridays and Saturdays as well
so you do get a lot of content from me
so I hope that you will consider
subscribing if you have not yet
subscribed but I'm excited to bring you
a new anti health and health was created
by Kimberly Clark I do have her channel
Alyssa down below in all of my anti
hauls to give her credit for this video
idea but if you would like to see some
makeup than I will not be buying why
don't we go ahead and get started with
this one - anti health one eye shadow
palette I feel like that has been making
a buzz lately but I just am NOT
interested in it is from BH Cosmetics
called the solar flare eyes shadow
palette has 18 different metallic
eyeshadows and it's $15.99 I'm seeing
some swatches of it and it does look
very pretty and pigmented and for BH
Cosmetics which is a more affordable
brands that sound being sold at Ulta I
mean 16 bucks for the 18 shades I don't
think that's a bad price at all but I
just don't think that I would get enough
use out of this eyeshadow palette I
don't reach for like these types of
metallic shades a ton and I've also just
gotten a lot of new eyeshadow palettes
like I just don't need any at this time
and unless they really make me like do a
double-take catch my attention I feel
like I can really come to good use I'm
just you know trying to say no to them
so it looks like it launches on June
14th so it's already been out for a
while
against sixteen dollars I don't think
it's best price and if you love this
type of eyeshadows again the swatches
and tutorials that I've seen with it
look pretty darn good but for me I'm
just not interested
so Lime Crime is coming out with a few
new releases in a mermaid collection
there's a highlight palette for $38
looks like they also have some like
metallic lipsticks as well I'm just so
not into these
kind of over that trend like the mermaid
unicorn trend like I'm trying to move
away from it I have fun with it for a
little bit but I'm trying to like go
away with it but it seems like companies
are just still gonna keep coming out
with them and I'm just it's just not me
it's not the look that I go for I don't
go for Metallica lips a lot and like
this mermaid highlight palette I just
don't need it I mean I definitely don't
need any highlights the shades look
pretty but I'm just I'm just kind of
like over this trend like it can we move
on to the next thing because I'm ready
for the next thing you don't have
anything from Lime Crime I've just never
felt the need to purchase something from
them so I just don't really have an
interest in these at all and again the
metallic shades don't look like anything
that I would wear so I'm going to pass
over the mermaid collection from a Lime
Crime but let us know if you plan on
picking any of this up
a lot of tags actually on the Bobbi
Brown collection I was going to wait to
put it in a will I buy it but I have
just been getting so slammed with what I
buy it suggestions so I haven't been
able to talk about it yet the Bobbi
Brown has their summer 2017 collection I
have three different eyeshadow trios
each are $40 they have three different
highlighters HR $48 and I also have nail
polish for sixteen dollars each now I'll
be inserting some photos in here like I
do with my Intel videos the eyeshadow
palettes look fantastic and the
highlighters do look really nice as well
it's just that's pretty pricey for
things that I just don't need I try to
do a good job where if something does
make me do a double-take I'll say I'll
think about it do I need it is it worth
the price etc etc if nothing makes me do
a double-take
I try just to move on the nail polish
didn't really get me even though I'm a
nail polish junkie I just a $60 to me is
pretty expensive like I'm around $8 and
that's kind of like the higher mark for
me I don't know if I've ever spent over
10 for a nail polish off the top of my
head I don't think I have and like well
the eyeshadows look really pretty you're
getting three different shades for $40
and I feel like that's expensive like I
just got the morphe and Jasmine palette
and that was $38 for 35 shades that's a
lot of shades even like the dose of
colors they're marvelous moths that was
five shades for $32 I mean was
and you only get three shades and $40
like that just seems pricey and while
the palace do look cool I just know that
I I just want to be able to go out you
thought of them I don't think and even
like the swatches that I've seen
actually didn't really look that great
so I know I know that I could pass over
it I don't have any Bobby Brown
highlighters and I do hear good things
about them but forty eight dollars for
one highlighter when I don't need any
more highlighters right now like I just
don't I'm so full with highlights so I
just know that I can save my forty
dollars that towards something else so
I'm going to pass over the Bobby Brown
summer collection but I did Gala tags on
this so let me know what you think in
the comments down below so two-face has
come out with a new product it is the
Born This Way a cereal setting powder
said it's going to be available to 15 so
it's already out but I haven't really
actually heard anything about it I'm
looking at the trend mode one Instagram
for a lot of these so I'll have her page
link down below as well like I do in
most megabyte videos so it just says is
this setting for I seriously I've not
heard anything else about this so
looking on the Too Faced web sides are
born this place setting powder cereal
setting powder it's $32 it says a silky
lightweight powder set to make up for
longer wear while providing a veil of
perfecting luminosity for finish so
natural to think you were born this way
okay um no I'm not going to get this and
not even just because I'm not on the
two-phase bus right now
I just don't need another setting powder
and I have really been neglecting my
powders because I haven't been baking as
much lately like I feel like maybe every
six times I do my makeup I am baking
because it's just been a little too like
heavy and like dry for my face we're
just strange like maybe as we get into
summer months I'm going to be like gone
all day maybe I will but I was really
having issues with like dry under eyes
and then like dry patches all over here
on the side of my forehead is really
strange but I was kind of staying away
from baking or anything really heavy on
my face like that that was kind of like
cling to those dry patches so I just
don't need it I mean I need to like bust
open my other setting powder as I
already
as my Laura Mercier I went from part I
have a Kat Von D like I just don't need
it so 32 bucks for a setting powder that
would like to sit stagnant and my
drawers that would just be very sad so I
don't really have a big interest in the
setting powder either but let us know if
you saw this and absolutely had to have
it I think a lot of people like the Born
This Way Foundation and concealer I
haven't tried either but I know let us
know if you're interested in this so
Geoffrey star is coming out a summer
collection so it will be available june
24 so it should be already out by the
time this video goes up so it includes 8
the lure liquid lipsticks by blip a
munitions 3 lip scrubs and two new
chrome skin frost okay I'm not going to
be purchasing anything from this I said
it in the past I'm just not a fan of
Jeffrey star I just don't feel like
supporting so I just don't really have
any interest in this one nothing has
really changed my mind
that made me want to purchase from his
brand I'll never know you know maybe
this time next year I'll be a huge fan I
don't know but as of right now I'm just
still not a jeffree star fan so for me
that means to not support the brand by
not finding the makeup I feel ok with it
I don't feel like I'm missing out on
anything like not saying now does makeup
isn't good because I do hear good things
about some of his products I think
especially the liquid lipsticks people
seem to really like but with so much
makeup in so much brains out there like
I just I truly don't feel like I am
missing anything I would need to you
know support something that I don't
fully believe in I don't feel like I'm
missing out in that sense if that makes
sense so I'm not going to be buying
anything else from Jeffrey star anytime
soon so the summer collection just
nothing interest to me and then I just
don't support the brand also so I won't
be getting anything from this collection
but let us know in the comments HBO is
taking anything out from the jeffree
star summer collection so see ah say
London has a new collection which
includes liquid chrome or duo chrome lip
glosses and also a rainbow highlighter
like that's all are doing lately and I'm
like ah I just can't wait for the next
nutrient to be here like what's it going
to be because I'm ready to get out of
this trend which I know like some people
are absolutely loving it and I get it we
all have different styles and we all
have you know different makeup vibes but
my makeup vibe is not metallic is not
duochrome
is not rainbow it's just not my advice
so everybody whose vibes it is like I
hope that you've been having a fun time
during this trend but I'm over here like
ready for the next one so yes from ciate
London they're new rainbow highlighter
and a liquid chrome grasses I just
really don't have any interested so I'm
not going to be buying those either but
are you is that your buy let us know
like are you loving this trend you never
want it to end this it let us know your
thoughts in the comment another item
from Too Faced I've been asked a lot of
questions about this one I think who you
guys know that I love makeup myth so
they came out they're hangover three and
one replenishing a primer and setting
spray so it says that it's available now
at $32 it's based in healing coconut
water and probiotics so I have such a
regular hangover primer and I don't
really like it I feel like everybody
else likes it I just got a little sample
guy of it and I used the sample to be
able to test it I was like no I would
never buy this as a full-size I didn't
really think I acted it's like a primer
I'd like to me it kind of felt like a
moisturizer I also liked it did anything
for my makeup so that is like the
biggest reason why I don't have interest
in buying this one because I just don't
know like I didn't feel like the
original this product worked for me so
why was this one work for me
I do love makeup mists and setting
sprays and primer sprays and all that I
have a giant collection of them so I
mean I definitely just don't need this
one I'm also not really buying from Too
Faced right now so I just don't need it
I know a lot of people have been sending
it to me but I'm going to go ahead and
pass over at the Hangover saurian 1
replenishing primer and setting spray
from Too Faced but has anybody tried
this yet and what do you think of it it
gives it fantastic let me know this next
one is skincare this is from grow and
glow so they are coming out with a
firming treatment sonic blue collectible
edition in their gravity mud so it's
basically a collaboration with Sonic
all right so it's a masonic blue gravity
mud is back with us to friends Tails and
Knuckles and three limited edition blue
tubes is $22 each so gravity mud is an
interesting tightening and firming mud
mask to peel off to reveal skin that
feels tighter and lifted so I'm not
buying it honestly I used to be on the
glam below train like kind of when I
first started my channel and everybody
was using glam glow I was like I have to
use glam below too and they are super
expensive like one of their regular jars
is like $69 or something like that and
that is pretty crazy so these are $22
for 1.7 ounces of product I'm also not
really into Sonic it to be honest I
really thought a cartoon not positive so
I mean obviously the collaboration isn't
speaking to me if I don't know what that
is
but no I don't need it like I mean I
have an EVA Colangelo mask in a very
long time and I'm okay with it I have my
other skincare products in massive doing
just fine for me so I'm okay passing
over the glam glow but yeah now the
sonic collaboration did nothing for me
so I'm not going to be getting these but
who could tell me what Sonic is and if
you're picking up these masks so let me
know the last product that I know that I
will not be picking up are the issue way
high pigment lip glosses so those at the
Dell Wyse you weigh in on bootylicious
for teen new high pigment lip glosses
with new formulas new packaging it has
coconut oil and ohhohh whole haba that I
said whole haba seed oil to moisturize
your lips for $17 and it is permanent
I'm not going to get them I don't want
to have anything a--from as you weigh I
just haven't been able to get into the
brand yet maybe that will change
sometime soon but as of right now I just
don't have really anything from them I'm
hearing good things about the lip
glosses I'm just not a huge lipgloss
person like every now and then I reach
for them and when I do I like them
because there's been so many cancer I'm
like I think I'm getting into lip
glosses but then I'm really not
most of time I wear lip gloss is like
overall liquid lipsticks I very rarely
wear lip glosses alone even when they
are super pigmented like these are
supposed to be I just prefer to wear the
liquid lipsticks which
by preference but no I still I'm liking
lipglosses a little bit more I have
enough in my collection that I don't
need to buy a new one for 17 dollars but
yeah I will not be purchasing the issue
way high pigment lip glosses but let us
know in the comments down below if you
will be buying from them or if you've
already purchased these and do
absolutely love them let us know but
after those that's going to be it for my
