today's video is going to be a new anti
hull I suppose my into health about once
a month talking about makeup that I will
not be buying in addition to my antenna
hogs I also post a will I buy it every
single week on Wednesday it's kind of a
just spin-off to the anti house that was
a tank created by Kimberly Clark I
always have her link down below in my
anti haul my will I buy it's kind of
just talks about products that I will
and will not be buying and kind of why
why not focusing on new releases as well
so I do have an anti how a flash will I
buy it playlist I will have that a link
down below before we get started I do
want to say thank you so much for
clicking on this video so we appreciate
you coming by I do post a video every
single day right now if you do enjoy
getting a daily content on makeup and
beauty I hope that you will consider
subscribing before you leave I have 20 k
keeo is going on right now on both
YouTube and instagrams you want to make
sure to get entered in those because
they are some big old giveaways but if
you would like to see some makeup that I
am not buying in the month of July I was
all head and get started but first up
color pop came out with a new collection
of course they did because I was coming
I was a new collection but they came out
with a new collection with Karrueche I
think they've done a collab with her in
the past and then they did this femme
Rosa collection I believe it actually
launched last week obviously I didn't
buy it I think it may be sold out so I
thought I saw something about a restock
but again I I don't buy it but there was
a 12 pan eyeshadow palette of $16 a
pressed powder face palette for 15 SM
Rosa lip bundle that was $15 or you can
buy them individually at $6 or you could
buy the entire collection at 40 or a PR
collection at 46 I noticed this with the
I love Sarah E collection they have like
a PR bundle that you could buy for a
little bit more and I think it's
basically you're just like getting the
box I think that's what it looked like
to me when I looked at the I love Sarah
T one I was like mm $6 your box alright
okay let's go but I am going to be
passing over this I don't really follow
Karrueche so the collaboration isn't a
big pull to me I also did recently
purchase some from colour-pop I actually
have the I love Sarah E eyeshadow
palette in saucy on my eyes right now
but it just didn't call out to me it's
nothing really
screamed my name I didn't do it we'll
take it all I don't really follow
through the collaborator is colour-pop
comes out with a lot a lot of new
releases they're always coming out with
new collections and trying to limit
myself on what I want to get from
colour-pop unless it's something that
like really really speaks to me because
sometimes I've done that thing where
they come out with something I'm like
yeah
I kind of want that and it's colour-pop
and they're inexpensive so just do it
and until we clear they're really
something I'm like I have to have that
and then I'm buying it again and then as
I buy more and more colour-pop I'm like
hey girlfriends now you're not really
like all that affordable with colour-pop
and just keep buying more and more so I
think that's where going to do with
colour-pop unless something is like
traumatically screaming my name I'm not
gonna buy it okay that's one way to do
so yes the colour-pop and Karrueche
collaboration I passed over that get
quite a few tags on this I was going to
feature it in a will I buy it but I just
I only usually feature four products in
each will I buy it so I can talk a
little bit more in-depth on each of them
without making like an hour-long video
and I swear it like just things keep
popping up and popping up and popping up
I haven't been able to include it but
Besame cosmetics came out with a Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs
collection I think I'm Besame I think
that's how you say it but it could
definitely be wrong so an eyeshadow
palette the storybook palette for $68 II
I'm wishing plus keep singing eyeshadow
palettes those are each $45 they have a
vanity mirror for $40 a translucent
pearl powder for $35 cream Rouge blush
for $20 lip balms for $18 each a mini
liquid lipstick set for $35 individual
lipsticks or $22 each a travel case for
$35 and two pouches for $15 each that is
a huge collection
oh my word that is crazy I am reading
from the trend moon Instagram like I
normally do in the anti Halle Moabite
videos so her Instagram page is linked
down below as well so well that's a lot
going on obviously this is the anti haul
so I'm not buying anything from it I
just don't feel like I need anything
right now I've never purchased anything
from Besame cosmetics and I feel like I
really haven't heard a lot about them
until I started getting tags on this
specific collection so if you
have tried out Besame cosmetics let me
know your thoughts on them if this is a
brand that I need to like have on my
radar over here I would love to know any
feedback that you guys might have again
I just I don't feel like I need anything
sometimes when collections come out like
this and they're so big like to me it is
kind of overwhelming and you know that's
just me personally I know some people
like big collections and they like to
buy the full collection or they like to
have a lot of different options in the
collections but for some reason for me
it just overwhelms me like I just don't
need anything I did mention in a
previous will I buy it that since I do
have my 20 take giveaways going on
obviously I buy a lot for those
giveaways and then as I'm buying for
them I'm also buying for me
so typically around my big giveaway
times my makeup collection is rising and
rising because I'm fighting for me at
the same time it just is what it is so
I've definitely been buying a lot more
for myself and I've also gotten like an
influx of PR recently which is
absolutely amazing and incredible but my
poor little office is like bursting at
the seams and I'm trying to figure out
how to organize my makeup collection in
the best way so it doesn't feel like I
walk in and like I'm drowning in makeup
which isn't a bad thing I mean that's
not like if you're going to go then
drowning and makeup sure but it's just a
little like overwhelming to me right now
so I'm trying to be really good on
unless I really need something and it
really calls out to me like don't get it
so I'm trying trying really hard but
yeah this collection just didn't really
do a lot for me kinda reminds me a bit
of like the lorac Pirates of the
Caribbean and then also the Beauty and
the Beast
I have both of those collections so I
just just don't feel like I need this
one I'm going to go ahead and pass over
this collection but I'd love to know if
anybody picked anything up from it and
your thoughts on it probably that I will
not be getting from Anastasia Beverly
Hills she just released a liquid glow
liquid highlighter there's four
different shades they're $25 each so
will be available July's like this so
they should be out by the time this
video goes up and then it says also in
stores on August 15 I simply just don't
need any highlights like I don't I just
don't need any I have so many highlights
right now it is completely overwhelming
and even still I know I just bought a
face palette from Sonia Kashuk and that
has a high
in it and I feel like I just bought
something else and it had it's like a
palette that I have highlights in it too
I can't even remember because seriously
like dropping makeup over here not that
I'm complaining
I would like to make note that I'm not
complaining but it is just a little bit
overwhelming and I just want to use some
of my favorites and some of my writer
dyes and some of my holy grails you know
what I'm saying I just want to be using
up some of those products before I just
keep filling and filling and filling my
collection but it's just you know is a
little overwhelming to look around and
think of everything that I want to be
trying and I want to be using I have
sold myself on a highlight no by I think
I'm doing pretty good I don't feel like
I have bought any likes just single
highlights recently the anastacio liquid
glow liquid highlighters it will be
passing over some lipsticks that I'm
going to be passing on are from coloured
raine they're coming out with satin
lipsticks all right so they're coming
back with a new formula so they're satin
lipsticks are coming back reformulated I
don't have a date yet if by the time
this video goes up I will have it down
in the description box down below I
think it's looking like they're 17
dollars I want to say so again I can
have that information everything that I
talked about will be linked down below
like prices are linked down there what I
am wearing is down there and all of that
good stuff so I am NOT going to be
purchasing these like there is 7
different shades again I have not tried
coloured raine I really do want to try
the Queen of Hearts eyeshadow palette I
know everybody loves that Queen of
Hearts palette but what do you guys
think about the lipsticks did you try
them I know they're saying this is a new
formula now but what else have you tried
from color rain is there anything else
that you really love from them I would
love to know I'm such a review junkie
myself I watched so many other review
videos I like to find new brands but I
also want to feel somewhat confident in
my purchases so I would let you know any
thoughts that you guys might have on
colored green and you know some variety
of their products but I know I just
don't need any I don't need any
lipsticks and even still I went to CVS
today to buy an envelope and for the
longest time I had one of those freaking
L'Oreal lipsticks like in the little
tube guys I had one of those in my hands
for the longest time and I was like put
the lipstick down you don't need any
what is wrong with you
lipsticks are so hard for me to say no
to highlight I feel like I confidently
my cell phone no by lipstick completely
different ballgame I never put myself on
a lipstick no vibe but I did say goodbye
Solaria lipstick I just don't need it
I just got massive lipstick packages
from NYX from Avon from Mac I'm clearly
ringing lipsticks in my office and areas
of snoring really allowed to apologize
if you can hear her but I just don't
need any lipstick so is what are you
doing girlfriend you got to get it
together I'm going to pass over these
from coloured raine they look
interesting the packaging looks cute I
hear good things about color grain but
it's just I don't need any right now I'm
passing over these lipsticks Oh moving
on a Lancome is coming out with some
dual finish highlighters in five
different shades it says it's an ultra
creamy powder formula and melting the
skin has a wet-dry technology that
allows for a customized highlight and
the ultimate versatility the dry first
of a glow are applied damp for more
intense result it has vitamin E and
triglycerides a non drawing formula
that's comfortable for all day where
there's only a lot of claims for a
highlight my goodness so it is 39 50
each it will be available online at
Nordstrom also coming to Macy's I'll
have any links of course that I can find
down below again I'm just I'm going to
be passing over these because I don't
need any highlights right now 49 50 for
a single highlight that's pretty pricey
to me compare it to like an Anasazi
aglow kit where you get the four
highlight shades for $40 you know I just
I know that I don't need them they
didn't really make me do any sort of
double take or anything like that I mean
they definitely have a ton of claims in
there that was a lot of stuff to read
about highlight I'm looking at the
swatches right now and they do look very
pretty I will say though that I don't
feel like just looking at the swatches
alone that I see like my highlight shade
in there a little bit more confident as
well that I can just go ahead and pass
over these but of course let us know if
your plane to pick up some blank
compilers I know a ton of you are just
like all about the highlight train I
totally get it
I'm on the highlight train like wearing
highlight and turning to like blind
people every single day but I just don't
need any more in my collection right now
so a new release from hourglass
cosmetics is there confession ultra slim
lipsticks in a 30 different shades which
does a lot of shades they're going to be
$34 each with an applique
or $22 for a refill that's very
interesting
it's supposed to be slim refillable
pigmented and sharp has a creamy satin
finish but almost like a matte long wear
according to the trend mood Instagram I
believe names are already available so I
will have them linked down below
now hourglass cosmetics is another one
who I'm not like any sort of loyal to
the brand I have the hourglass vanish
stick foundation I want to say that is
my only hourglass cosmetic that I own
I'm pretty sure so again I just not a
brand that I feel like myself are really
drawn to a lot I know they are more
pricey as well I do really love the
foundation I was just wearing it the
other day I enjoy it so to try different
lip products I like to try different lip
formulas to see what works best for me
see what I can recommend and all of that
good stuff but again I just have so many
lipsticks right now just too many
lipsticks right now I know that I can
say no especially for the $34 price tag
yeah the $34 price tag I know that I can
definitely say no it sounds like a
formula that I would really like to try
just to be able to try it out and give
my thoughts on but I also have to be you
know conscientious at the same time I'm
going to pass over the new hourglass
confession ultra slim lipsticks cool
idea but it's not going to be for me
right now so the last items featuring in
this month's anti haul is not actually
makeup it is sunglasses I actually did
get asked if I was going to be
purchasing any of the sunglasses from
the key and Kylie collaboration I don't
know maybe it's because I was talking
about wanting to get a new pair
sunglasses recently on my snapchat I
actually did end up purchasing a pair
from ki Australia ironically enough
there I believe it's the Midnight
Runners sunglasses I'm going to replace
my key desi sunglasses on the low that
broke so I bought midnight runner and
I'm still very happy with them but no
I'm not purchasing any of these
sunglasses you know I have talked about
Kylie cosmetics I've talked about some
production West in the past in anti haul
and Willa diet videos and this time I'm
just not really interested in supporting
there's so many brands out there that I
would like to support there's so many
indie brands and upcoming brands that I
would rather support as well and
honestly I was pretty bummed out to see
ki Australia team up with Kylie Jenner
like really like I thought it was really
cool when I teamed up with
see I think they've also done collapse
with crispy like it's really interesting
to see like the youtubers the more like
regular people getting to collab with
big brands like that I think that's
really neat so when I saw I got the
email cuz you know I'm on their mailing
list and it said the king of all
collections and my first thought was a
team is with a guy I was like oh my gosh
cool like me I can buy my husband a pair
sunglasses and I know it's because I
think Kylie's instagrams like King Kylie
or whatever her snapchat is or whatever
she calls herself the king fantastic and
I saw that and I was like really
ah okay then but no I'm just not
interested in supporting right now I
just I've had so many bad experiences
with Kylie cosmetics and I just I just
can't get behind it damn out with quite
a few styles and in different colors
things like that honestly yeah I don't
really see any of the sunglasses that
caught my eye I know a bunch of the
bigger influencers got all of them and I
was watching Jacqueline Hill on her
snapchat when she was trying them on and
she was just like no like nothing fuser
for me and I was over for like the
regular girl like she just was that
really feeling him maybe it was one
white pair that she said that she liked
maybe but no like none of them I don't
think anyone would look good on my face
I'm kind of weird with sunglasses
because I have a very narrow face like
most sunglasses just don't work out for
me I have a really hard time finding
sunglasses I was so bummed because the
high keys from desi and Kiara just are
way too big for like my little tiny face
so bummed about that but no I'm not
interested at all in this I was actually
kind of just like bummed when I saw it
but I don't know those are just my
feelings and I know a lot of people have
a lot of feelings about the Kardashians
and the Jenners
and that is just my particular opinion
and you can have whatever opinion you
want but I'm not going to buy something
when I don't want to support the person
who is also making the paycheck off of
it so I would rather put my money
towards something else that I truly want
to support so I'm passing over
everything from the key and Kylie
collection
I just checked the key website before as
I come to film and there were some
Styles still available online so they
are not sold out so I will have some
links down below in case you are
interested in purchasing them because if
you are then
that's fantastic because you get to do
what you want to do and I get to do what
I want to do but after that that is
