I'm excited for today's video because
it's going to be a first-of-its-kind
video and basically I'm going to be
doing like an anti haul or an unhaul or
going over like makeup and beauty
products that I will not be buying and
I've been seeing these videos for a
while now and I just find them so
interesting to watch because it's
interesting to me to see what people are
not gravitating towards or where like
people draw the line on cost like nope
that's just too expensive and even to
see and hear people's reasonings for
like not supporting certain brands or
certain people are things like that it's
just it's just interesting to me to get
other people's opinions and feedbacks
because obviously we are all completely
different we have different preferences
when it comes to makeup and beauty and
what we need in our collection what we
will spend who we will support kind of
thinking about doing this one for a
while but I've gotten a few like snaps
and messages from people like why don't
you have any of this or why don't you
ever talk about that brand or this
product just launched are you gonna buy
it and review it and I have my reasons
for what I buy and I have my reasons for
what I don't buy that may be nervous
about this video is that I don't want to
come off as like bashing or being super
negative like usually everything is all
like positivity but I don't in my
opinion I don't see these videos in like
a negative light like I said it's just
interesting to get to know people and
their preferences and what it is that
they want to spend money on and what it
is that they don't want to spend money
on and kind of the reasons being for
that so hopefully that's how you guys
will perceive this as well like none of
us is meant to be super negative and of
course there's there's going to be
negative things that I'm talking about
in an anti haul but I don't want to
touch on the negative be like too much I
just want to kind of explain each thing
and I've just been kind of making a list
and especially when it came to people
asking me like hey are you gonna buy
this product or hair you're gonna review
this product those are the ones that
definitely went on my list so hopefully
I can explain myself a little bit more
to everyone who is wondering if I'm
buying certain products and certain
brands and things like that but yeah I'm
excited for this video I'm excited for
something new hopefully you guys will
like it if you do I can do more of these
in the future because of course it's a
lot of fun to do hauls and it's a fun
for me to watch hauls but at the same
I can't buy everything I can only haul
so much for you guys hopefully this
video will be fun to watch I'm excited
to do it and yeah let's just hop into my
anti haul is actually a brand and there
was a few comments that I got after I
did my lipstick collection declutter in
there I got rid of every single drug
Cosmetics lipstick and lip gloss that I
owned and I kind of touched on a little
bit of my thoughts I'm joy cosmetics and
why it is that I'm actually not gonna
purchase for them and even though
there's like two lipsticks in there that
I actually did like I got rid of them
anyways because I've decided that direct
cosmetics is not gonna be a brand that I
support a lot of questions after that
video it was an issue with a snapchat
that went out that about a customer and
it just really like it just really
turned me off and and I want to make
sure that I'm saying like I'm not just
not supporting a brand because of those
things like I don't like those things
and that's what's upsetting to me
because what if I was that girl and I'm
seeing an order of a brand with a
popular youtuber like talking about
me I can't even imagine how I would feel
like I would feel so horrible but at the
same time I have ordered from Gerard
cosmetics and I haven't been happy with
the product so I tried again and again I
think I placed three or four orders
which are cosmetics because I was like
so many people are talking about them
and youtubers are collaborating them and
other people are liking I'm like I have
to like them like I have to keep trying
like I'll find the product that works
for me and I really was not able to find
the products that work for me so just
kind of those two things coupled
together have made me decide that I'm
not gonna purchase from Gerard cosmetics
anymore that's kind of my thoughts on
during cosmetics so I thought I would
explain that because I did get a lot of
questions and especially after the
lipstick declutter video when I kind of
touched on it a little bit but certain
videos about it I watched the different
responses that people had and then I
made my own opinion out of that and
that's all that we can do is try to be
as informed as we can and make our own
opinion and move on so another product
that I've decided I will not be
purchasing is the lorac pro 3 palette so
I actually do not own anything from
lorac which is so crazy because people
just love the lorac palette
and I see him so often and I don't have
any of them and the lorac 3 is not like
super new I think it came out just a
couple months ago but it's still like
fairly newer it's their newest pilot I
believe and a lot of people were
starting to talk about it and I went
through like should I get it you're
reviewing it should I be doing looks
with it and I looked up the palette
online and it wasn't anything like
screamed out at me and it was $44 but
you know is expensive and I was actually
really glad that I weighed it because I
started watching the reviews come in and
I've said this in previous videos that
I'm such a huge fan of watching reviews
I love being a reviewer because I hope
it helps people as much as other
people's reviews helped me I watched so
many reviews on things especially more
pricier items that I'm thinking about
buying if I won't buy it right away I
will wait for those reviews to come in
and then I will make my decision and of
course everybody is different everybody
has things that they love for certain
reasons are dislike for certain reasons
but I kind of listened to everybody's
opinion and then I make my own opinion
from there that's just how I do things
but I just saw negative review after
negative review after negative review on
the lorac 3 palette I did not see a lot
of good feedback about this one and I
was like ok nope that's $44 that I don't
need I'm not a huge eyes shadow palette
junkie like I'm just not I prefer to
spend my money on like lipsticks or
highlighters things like that eyelashes
even or even like tools and skincare
that's what I prefer to spend my money
on versus eyeshadow palettes and even
eyeshadow singles I just don't know if I
always think especially palettes are
worth the money because there's always
gonna be those like two to three to four
colors and the palette that you just
don't wear and it's like is it really
worth it so the lorac 3 I've decided I'm
gonna pass on like that I will not be
buying is the Pat McGrath skin fetish
highlighters so I started seeing these
like popping up on snapchat and like the
beauty influencers were getting them and
talking about them and they looked
really beautiful I'll say that red why
they looked really beautiful and like I
said I do like highlighters and I do
like spending money on highlighters so
instantly I was like oh my gosh I think
this might be something that I
need and then I looked it up and they
are $72 which to me I'm like okay that's
you know that's a little pricey and I
looked into a little bit further and you
do get three items with this so you're
getting like a balm highlighter and a
powder highlighter and then also a brush
but I also started watching the reviews
and people are like this brush is a
straight-up disaster like not a lot of
people had positive comments about the
brush so I'm like well take the brush
out now you're paying seventy two
dollars for a foam highlighter and a
powder highlighter and I'm like who is
$72 for two like good products because
people do have a lot of really good
things to say about the actual
highlighters just not the brush that
comes with the trio but still you know I
can spend $40 on the anasazi Beverly
Hills glow kids and get four
decent-sized highlighters and that was
expensive to me like that was like I was
like I don't know if I could spend any
more money on a highlighter like that
was kind of a lot right for this
highlight palette but $72.00 ourselves
like me and I just I can't do it I know
Pat McGrath is like very respected in
the makeup industry that's amazing but
I'm not gonna be able to spend the money
on the skin fetish highlighters that one
is like a brand that I am not supporting
and I'm actually like super
uncomfortable to talk about this I kept
going back and forth and back and forth
like should I even say this I don't even
know because there's so much controversy
about this right now
and I've actually been planning to film
this video for the past four days we've
just had really rainy weather and I
haven't been able to film it it's like
going back and forth and if I was gonna
touch on this subject or not and then
things went down just the day prior to
me filming this and now I'm like man
that was some crazy stuff but it is the
jeffree star cosmetics and I actually
decided a while ago that I did not want
to purchase from Geoff first are just
things that I was seeing I was just not
very impressed with I did try to watch
some of his YouTube videos and it just
wasn't working and I think it was like
two weeks after I added him on
chat the whole makeup Shayla thing went
down and I was like horrified watching
that that was really really hard to
watch I absolutely hate when people are
like when your bank account matches mine
come talk to me that's so disgusting no
one cares that shouldn't mm-hmm that
should never be said that's so gross in
my opinion and I immediately had to get
rid of him on snapchat because I was
like I'm not gonna watch something like
that again you I don't understand how he
will say things like we need to support
each other and build each other out then
we need to be positive and then go off
and call a woman such terrible
disgusting names I just I'm not able to
do it I've seen the videos out there of
like people complaining about certain
products and then his like response to
it like that's what made me nervous
because I was like oh my god just he
gonna come back or me like hopefully he
never sees this video who doesn't come
after me because he scares me a little
bit when he comes after people that I
have a problem with them and then
everything just kind of went down with
cavenda yesterday and that was really
shocking to me like if that really I saw
it was the first thing that I saw when I
logged on to my computer in the morning
and I was just like mind blown I know
there's two sides to every story and I
understand what Jeffry says and like yes
I have gone off in the past but I've
apologized for everything if you keep
going off and you keep having to
apologize for the same thing that
clearly seems like you're not actually
taking anything away from it like yeah
you can say you're sorry but what are
you sorry for and are you gonna try to
fix in the future I don't think so I see
things so blatant like that I'm like I
just don't think I can support it and I
have friends who support him and are so
excited and he just did a launch today
and I had a lot of snapchats like hey
are you buying this are you getting this
what do you think and I'm just like no
I'm not I can't I I can't and you know
it's just one of those things where you
can watch and try to be an as informed
as you can and then you can make your
own opinions from there and that's
exactly what I'm doing I've just I made
my own opinion and just one of the
biggest reasons that I guess I decided
that I would actually talk about it is
because especially after today when he
launched like a liquid lipstick bundle I
had so many snapchats asking me if I
bought it
if I thought it was worth it or things
like that and I'm like I've never owned
any of his products I don't want to and
it's just something that me myself I
don't want to support so there's just a
few other things that you know really
bother me the drug use I just that's not
that's not my lifestyle Paul and I when
I was watching his snapchats when I
first added time I was like I'm really
tired of seeing this and I know it goes
in like his YouTube videos too and I
just that's not for me and then also
like I just get really tired of seeing
like your fancy cars and your handbags
and everything and I think there is a
really big difference between like being
proud of what you have and like where
you come from and where you are now and
then there's just like straight-up
bragging and that's all it came off to
me as it might come off differently to
other people that's fantastic but that's
how it came off to me and it just it
constantly made me feel like beneath you
know I don't want to say like beneath
him because obviously I am but it just
like I don't know do you guys know what
I'm saying like it just really bothered
me and then coupled that with the
comment that you made about makeup
Shayla like when our bank accounts match
like then you can talk to me it's like I
just don't I just don't appreciate it
but because I was getting so many snacks
asking if I was buying or what I think
about is lipsticks or if I'm getting is
eyeshadow palette or things like that I
thought I would touch on it and just let
you guys know that those are the
reasonings that's the conclusion that
I've come to with definitely star
cosmetics and that's the reason I will
not be purchasing from him so another
one to talk about is actually another
youtuber as well and he's done a lot of
like collabs with makeup brands and I've
just never felt the urge to purchase any
of them and that is me me anyway now he
did have like a role as well in the
jarred cosmetics issue that happened
with the snapchat that went out and
really since then like my opinion of him
went down a lot and again that's just my
opinion I know obviously he has so many
other supporters but I've just chosen
not to be one of those and I know he has
done collaborations with like makeup
geek and Oprah and
put out some really interesting things
but I've just really had no desire to
run out and purchase them and I think it
is his his palette with makeup geek I
think it's like 9 different eyeshadows
like so many people ask me about that
one and do I have it what I recommend it
what would I like what would be
something similar to it that maybe
doesn't cost as much and that sort of
thing and I'm just like no I don't have
it and I'm not going to buy it because I
just is someone that I don't choose to
support and you know when it comes to
YouTube there are so many youtubers out
there and big ones and big beauty
influencers and these collaborations are
coming hard and fast and it seems like
everybody is teaming up with cosmetics
and we're just not going to support
everybody it's just it's unrealistic to
think that way you know I have like my
top 5 favorites and they're gonna be
different from your top 5 favorites and
they're gonna be different from your top
5 favorites like we're all just so
different and we we just get to make our
own opinions and that's the beauty of
living in this world unfortunately what
you know the part that I said that
scared me with making this video is like
the bad feedback you know you're always
kind of worried about that but I just
hope that one day people can get that
we're all different and we're all
allowed to have different opinions and
it doesn't make anyone right and it
doesn't make anyone wrong it just makes
us us so that's just another one that I
have chosen not to support for personal
reasons another product that I decided
that I wasn't gonna buy and I sat on
this one for a while
I saw the snapchats that they were
coming out and I got my first instinct
was like oh my gosh I'm so excited I
can't wait to get these and then I got
kind of confused and what I'm talking
about is a collab between a youtuber
Jaclyn hill and Becca cosmetics Jaclyn
hill is one of my favorite youtubers I
will go out and say that right now if
she's one of my favorite youtubers I
watched all of her videos I get so
excited when she posts up all of her and
snapchat I just think that she's a very
inspiring person and she's someone who I
do choose to support I know that there
was a lot of controversy around her and
she's not gonna be everybody's favorites
and again that's all our own opinions
but she's put out a few different
collabs with Becca cosmetics I purchased
the champagne pop when it came out and I
just absolutely loved it
then you know a few months back she did
a very large collaboration with Becca
she was doing all sorts of things about
the champagne pop in different forms of
champagne pop she had a face palette
coming out and I was so excited I
actually purchased the face palette
during like almost like a pre-launch
that she had like during this big
beautiful party that was thrown for her
in New York and you can only buy the
face palette on the Sephora app and I
bought it oh this is the face palette
that she came out with it's like it's
hard to show on camera because it's so
like shiny and stuff but this is what
the inside of it looks like it has three
different blushes up here and then two
highlighters on the bottom one of them
is champagne pop which I do own a
full-size of it so that was kind of like
a do i buy it again my champagne pop is
shattered which really sucks but I was
like well I might as well get it and
then I'm getting all these beautiful
blushes up here as well and then you're
getting the new highlight which is a
Prosecco pop and I bought it I'm happy
with it I love this I love love love
love love love love this palette I use
it all the time I think it's amazing I
love the blushes I love Prosecco pop I
love champagne pop have it all together
in a palette it's great love it so there
was a lot of controversy around her
launch because it turned out that the
eyeshadow palettes that she made with
Becca like some of them were made in a
different factory or something all of
them they were not the same quality
across the board some pallets were good
some pallets were horrible they ended up
pulling the eyeshadow palette and it was
kind of like very confusing like whoa
wait how well how does that happen so
that was a little weird and then very
shortly after that happened all of a
sudden these split pans were coming out
and Jaclyn was showing them on her
snapchat and Becca was talking about
them and basically they look like the
regular I mean I'll insert a picture but
they look like the regular Becca
compacts but inside is two different
pans one it's a blush one is a highlight
now some of them have blushes from this
palette and they have either champagne
pop or Prosecco pop as the highlighter
those are the two highlights in there
and then they have different blushes
some from this palette and some like
regular Becca blushes were in there and
I was very confused
mostly because
when the champagne glow collection came
out there was no mention of these split
pans
I mean PR packages were going out to
people with the full collection in there
but not the split pans there was a huge
party being thrown in New York and the
whole collection was in there but no
split pans and it was like it just
seemed like really weird timing to me
that the eyeshadow palette has to get
pulled which that had to be a financial
hit for everybody I understand that
so the eyeshadow palette has to be
pulled and now all of a sudden oh
actually that wasn't the full collection
now this is the full collection we have
these split plans too I'm like what it
just was really really weird to me and I
don't want to like I don't want to say
that there was anything weird going on
but I even said it at my snapchat I was
like this just seems weird to me like
why were they not launched with the
collection as well because honestly in
my opinion I would have bought a split
pan over this not that I don't like this
but if I could have bought a split pan
and had like the amaretto blush in there
and the Prosecco pop highlight I would
have been over the moon happy this was
$54 and I believe this flip hands are
running for 32 so I would have saved
money as well and so I was like okay
that is a little weird because well I
love this palette I didn't need another
champagne pop the Prosecco pop I did
want amaretto I really love like these
two blushes I really do love it probably
would have been hard to like make a
choice of which blush I was gonna go for
honestly I probably would have gone for
amaretto a neutral blush and I don't
have any of those where I do have more
luminous blushes in my collection but
this blush over here it's called like
Pamplemousse it's like a hot coral I
don't use it at all like I've used it
once to try it out and I've never used
it again so I could have saved money and
bought those split pans if they came out
with the collection as well and I just
thought it was very strange and I don't
know for that reason like hey I don't
need to buy them because I have
everything in here unless there was a
different Becca blush that I want it
that wasn't from this palette I think
maybe there's only one or two of the
spilt pans that have just a Becca blush
in there but other than that I have
everything in here so if you have this
you probably don't need to get a split
pan but I thought about doing them like
just to have them and just be able to
show them and review them and take
pretty photos with them and all that
good stuff but it's like now something
something
the whole situation just kind of weirds
me out and this is just me being super
honest I something is weird to me about
that situation and for that reason I
will not purchase the slip pants and
then we're just about to wrap it up but
the last few products one is from Marc
Jacobs beauty it's the airbrush soft
glow duo so it is what it looks like to
be like a nice sized compact of blush
and you kind of have like a lighter on
one end and dark around the other and
you're supposed to be able to use both
or mix it together and make a color it
is $42 and unlike woohoo $42 for a blush
and I understand that you're supposed to
be able to like use the different colors
in there so essentially it's like two
blushes in one maybe I guess three if
you roll them together but still that
seems really pricey I've seen swatches
of it I seen it on snapchat and to me it
looks like a regular blush I don't know
Marc Jacobs is expensive it's just
pretty expensive and again I try to be
more conscientious with my money and the
products that I'm purchasing and I'm
actually just not a huge blush fan like
I'm simply just not someone who goes
like super crazy over blush so I'm gonna
pass on this $42 blush does anyone else
gotten it though do you like it
so another product I won't be purchasing
because I think it is expensive is from
cover FX and it is their custom enhancer
drops and this is a vial of like liquid
highlight and it is $42 per bottle and
again I'm like oh my god this little
expensive for one bottle and basically
you can use them like as a highlighter
I've seen people use them as like a
regular highlight or some people will
mix them in with their foundation and I
get it like that's such a cool concept
and I think it's a lot of fun I've
actually went to Sephora and I just
watched him on my hand and I was like
yes these are so beautiful and I love
highlighters like I love love love
highlighters but $42 for one product for
one bottle I'm like nope I just can't I
just can't do it and I see the pictures
and I see the swatches and I see the
tutorials and they look amazing they
look so so pretty but I'm just
gonna be able to do it I just can't in
my mind I just I can't justify you guys
do you have this one to just rub it in
if you do just just rub it in and I feel
like I tried to save like the Big Daddy
for last because I remember seeing this
product and I think I actually saw it on
like a blog post first I'm just seeing
like the new products that were coming
out and I saw this cute little compact
and I was like oh my gosh that looks
like so much fun like that might
actually be kind of fun to have and then
I looked at the price tag and I thinked
it so this is from Tom Ford and it is
there Soleil contouring compact so it is
from the pictures that I've seen and
even like the snaps that I've seen it
looks like a fairly small compact and
has three different colors in it a
highlight of blush and a contour shade
and it is a hundred and eight dollars
like nope like I remember I thought I
was like this looks super cute and for
like in my mind I was like it doesn't
look like it's really big maybe it'll be
somewhat affordable again it's Tom Ford
it's probably not gonna be affordable
and then it said a hundred and eight
dollars and I was like well that's just
that's just not gonna happen
I try to justify certain things but that
is one thing that there is no way in my
mind I would be able to justify spending
108 dollars on it compact with three
different shades in there so that's my
last one anything from Tom Ford I know
it's like a super-high-end rant like we
have high-end brands and then we have
like Tom Ford like I just cannot at this
moment in time purchase anything from
Tom Ford that I have seen like you know
he's got like nice brushes out there too
but I just I can't do it I can't I just
I just can't do it if you can do it
that's amazing my hat is up to you but
unfortunately for me I can't and that's
actually gonna be my last product in
this anti haul I will not be purchasing
a one hundred and eight dollar compact
anytime soon for my anti haul video
hopefully this wasn't too long I had
like so many other more products that I
could have gotten into and I was like no
you need to wrap it up at some point
everything that I did talk about was
more high-end if you guys do like this
concept or you found it interesting in
some way let me know or let me know if
you'd want to see more of like an
affordable product
because there's definitely products from
the drugstore or more affordable brands
that I think about buying and I I don't
do it for reasons a B and C so if you
guys want to see more of these in the
future if you're curious about them
please do comment below and let me know
give this video a thumbs up that really
just helped me know what it is that you
guys are liking to see as well but had a
lot of fun making this and I know it's
something a little bit different but I
have fun doing it and hopefully you guys
like it like I said I don't mean to come
off like negative or bashing or anything
like that with anything that I talked
about whether it's because of a collab
or a brand in general or even just
talking about the price and I don't want
to come off as like you guys shouldn't
buy these either because my biggest
biggest thing that I will always always
say is that we have to be true to
ourselves if you can justify buying
something that I can't that's great
because I can probably justify buying
something that you can't justify it
because we're all so different that's
all we can be we can just make our own
opinions and do our own things to me
it's just interesting to see other
people and what it is that they want to
buy I love watching hauls and then now
that these anti hulls are kind of
becoming like my weakness to watch as
well so I thought hey why not record it
so you guys can know a little bit more
about me I hope that helped answer some
of the questions that I get kind of
often about certain brands or products
or things that I have or what I
recommend or am I going to buy I hope
that helps too but yeah that was a lot
of fun and thank you guys so much for
watching does they give this video a
thumbs up if you did like it make sure
you are subscribed before you go and I
will cut you real soon on my next one
