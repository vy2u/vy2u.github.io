today's video is going to be a new anti
haul video and it is going to be my
Sephora VIP sale edition so the Sephora
vib sale is actually already started for
the VIP Rouge as I'm filming this video
I hope to get it up as quickly as I can
I did do a Sephora vib sale
recommendations video I will leave that
linked down below I will do a haul video
after I make my purchases I'm only a vib
so I have to wait a few more days yet
before I can get in on the sale but I
wanted to do one more type of video kind
of surrounding the Sephora VAV sale
because there's always so much hype
around and everyone is always so excited
for it so I asked my snapchat what they
would want to see most when it came to
it and the most voted on was actually
the anti haul which I thought was really
fun because I really liked that you guys
enjoyed my anti haul videos and I will i
buy videos and that you guys understand
that these are not negative videos in
the slightest if you actually watch them
these videos are not negative in any
sort of the way I'm more showing you
guys my thought process when it comes to
buying makeup and you know where where I
put my money because we are all so very
different we all have different reasons
for wanting to buy something I also
explain you know why I'm not buying it
but I also like that so many people are
understanding that these videos are to
show that we don't have to feel the
pressure to buy everything especially
being a youtuber there is so much
pressure to have like every single new
release and every single new product and
it's just not feasible so I like being
able to show that we don't need to put
that type of pressure on ourselves so I
wanted to do the anti haul because that
was the most voted on and I actually
haven't done an anti haul for a while
here yet I will link my playlist down
below I have a will I buy it
sloshing anti haul playlist so the
Sephora vib sale just real quick if you
don't know what it is it usually happens
two times a year Sephora gives a
discount for their VIP rouge VIP and
sometimes their beauty insider members
basically to be a VIP Rouge or a VIP
member you have to spend a certain
amount of money within the calendar year
at Sephora and then you get certain
perks you get like birthday gifts and
then you can get other perks along with
that but another one of the perks is
being able to participate in the sale
sometimes the view
insiders are able to everybody can be a
beauty insider at Sephora if you sign up
for their rewards program which is free
everybody can be one but for this sale
that's happening in November beauty
insiders do not get any percent off VIP
Rouge and VIP members both get 20% off
VAV Rouge gets to shop first and then
about a week or so later VIP gets to
shop so that's kind of just a very quick
rundown of the Sephora VIP sale it's a
really big deal everybody gets really
excited for it again I'll leave my video
link down below for my recommendation
sale and I will also be sharing a haul
video once I go in and shop but why
don't we go ahead and hop into what I
will not be buying during the Sephora
Biv sale okay so obviously all the
products that I'm going to talk about
can be found at Sephora I'll leave a
link down below just because I don't
want to buy something doesn't mean you
don't want to buy it again we all have
different reasons for why we buy the
makeup that way by why we spent the
money the way that we spend it this is
just me personally and what I'm not
buying so I have done a pretty recent
will i buy it video and I cover a lot of
the products that people have been
asking about if I'm going to buy
obviously I just recently filmed that
video so that will be linked down below
and again I also just filmed at the
recommendations video and I didn't want
to talk about anything that I put in
that video even though that video is not
hey this is everything I'm buying from
the sale or even hey this is my wish
list
it's just recommendations new products
had items things to maybe keep in mind
when you're doing your shopping so I
didn't want to repeat any of those items
because I've already spoke about it in
that past video so actually when I was
putting together this anti haul it was
kind of harder than I thought it was
going to be because there are some
products that I'm still undecided on
will I buy it will I not like I'm not
sure yet until I actually get to the
sale and start putting things in my cart
and having everything up there's still
some products that I'm kind of back and
forth on so to be able to find these
five products it actually took me a
little bit longer than I thought it
would but I'm the first one that a lot
of people have been asking me if I'm
going to get and the answer's no is the
Natasha intent on a star palette so this
eyeshadow palette has been pretty hyped
up recently a bunch of the influencers
got it sent in a PR package so we've
been seeing a lot of it on snapchat and
Instagram a lot of YouTube tutorials are
coming out with it and there's just a
lot of hype around it so this is
probably the most asked if I was
going to purchase it I will say this is
an expensive eyeshadow palette this
eyeshadow palette is 169 dollars inside
you are getting 18 eyeshadows now
Natasha de Nona is known for having very
excellent quality eyeshadow palettes I
will say that a lot of reviews that I
have seen a lot of tutorials I've seen
with her palettes are saying you know it
is very expensive but the quality is
like something that cannot be beat so
this is something that you truly are
paying for what you get which i think is
excellent if you are super super into
eyeshadows and you love collecting
eyeshadow palettes and you love like
quality top-of-the-line
I've shadows I think this would be a
good palette for you to get and also to
purchase during the vib sale if you're a
Rouge or VIP member because you're going
to get 20% off 20% off 169 dollars you
know if that's that's a pretty good deal
but I'm not gonna purchase it if you
guys have watched my videos in the past
I'm not a huge I shadow palette person
and I'm the eyeshadow palettes that I
absolutely love and I'm not saying that
I don't purchase eyeshadow palettes ever
but they really have to like call out to
me they really have to speak to me they
really have to make me want it and the
star palette doesn't do it for me yes
the price freaks me out
169 dollars for an eyeshadow palette
that is very expensive but it just is
and it's so hard even you can do up a
map and you can break it down and I know
someone did the math and my will i buy
it video I think it was or my aunt I
hall with the Marc Jacobs palette that's
$100 and they like broke it down and did
the math for me that's fantastic and I
totally get it
I get it but still when you're looking
at that sticker and it's 169 dollars
boom right there I'm not taking the time
to do the math because math is hard and
I prefer not to do that especially when
I'm shopping so it just it's hard but
again at the same time not a huge eye
shadow palette person but I will say
that this palette looks really really
really nice if the swatches have seemed
really great and like I said Natasha
Genoa is known for her high quality so
if you've been wanting to purchase this
palette getting it during the VIP sale
if you have that discount is an amazing
time to get it I haven't seen anything
with this palette being limited edition
which is something else that kind of
holds me back when I'm going to buy
things I haven't seen it not for sure if
that's the case or not but usually it
will say something like limit
in addition our something on the sephora
website I haven't seen it there so that
is good maybe this is something like in
the future I would be able to get down
the road but for right now and during
the vib sale I know this one will not be
going in my cart the next one that I
want to talk about is from Becca
cosmetics it's a new release it is their
blushed with a light palette so this is
a palette with three different blushes
in there and does say that this palette
is a limited edition your blushes that
come with it are wisteria songbird and
Snapdragon those names are all familiar
to me so I think those are Becca blushes
that you can get individually they're
just putting them in this limited
edition palette and the palette is
running for $34 one that I was kind of
going back and forth on like I don't
know that doesn't seem like a terrible
price
um to get a regular like full-size Becca
blush is $32 so to be able to like try
out a little sample size of them for 34
I thought that was a good idea so again
the palace $34 the regular Becca blush
is 32 you know obviously there is like a
size difference I think they're like a
gram bigger are just over a grand bigger
more product that you're getting in the
full-size edition versus the palette but
still it's not about price like if
you're a big fan of Becca blushes I feel
like this would be a good opportunity to
get three and spend $34 we're know
you're basically spending what you would
pay on a full sized one so I don't think
it's a bad price at all mostly the
reason why I'm not getting it is because
there have been other blush palettes
that I have my eye on lower and then I
want to get more and for someone who is
not like a huge blush person especially
like a blush palette type of person I'm
like do I need to get multiple blush
palette all at once
probably not so that's why I'm stepping
away from this one but I did want to
mention this because I have had a few
questions if I'm going to get it but
also I just again I don't think it's
about price and I think all the blushes
inside look really pretty so if you're
considering it for the VIP sale you know
getting the 20% off is a good time to do
it but for me since I have my eye on a
few other blush palettes I'm going to
skip over this one so the next one that
I want to talk about is one that I'm
actually not super familiar with and
it's probably been within like the last
two days I've started getting questions
on if
I'm gonna buy it or not and probably
within the last like couple days here as
well as when I've been seeing more like
influencers talk about it on snapchat
and and YouTube and that sort of thing
but it is from ciate London it's a
collaboration with Chloe Morello
so it's the CFT London Chloe Morello
beauty haul a makeup set so inside you
get a makeup pouch you are also getting
an eyeshadow palette and then it looks
like a lipstick and a mascara as well
and it's all for $49 so I have never
purchased anything from CF de London
it's a pretty newer brand to me I'm not
saying it's a new brand but it's one
that I'm really not super familiar with
at all and to be honest I'm not hugely
familiar with Chloe Morello either her
name is familiar to me but I'm not super
familiar with Chloe either so um this
this collection just didn't really like
jump out at me and so since I've been
seeing it the last couple of days and
I've been getting the questions and I've
been trying to look at it more and pay
attention to it a little bit more like
is that something that I think I need to
have but once again I don't know maybe
I'm the only person who has like makeup
speak to them I can't be the only person
right I cannot be the only person how's
makeup speak to them because there's
some times where releases come out and
it's just boom like I know it I need to
have it I can see it it's looking at me
it's like Samantha hello and then
there's other releases that come out and
they just you know they're looking at
someone else they're not looking at me
and this collection and this
collaboration it's just it's not looking
at me so I'm gonna pass over it again
stone like $49 you get it I showed a
palette looks like it has what five ten
fifteen fifteen iron shadow shades in
there and you get a mascara and a lippy
as well and then a makeup bag so $49 so
the 20% discount probably wouldn't be
awful but you know new brands to me I've
never tried them before not super
familiar with the collaborator eyeshadow
palette doesn't like super excite me so
I'm gonna skip over this one for now but
let me know if you guys are thinking
about picking this one up for yourself
so in preparation for making this video
and you know just just because the vib
sale is coming up in general I have been
watching a lot of you know the VIP
recommendations videos like the ones
that
I think I've been watching a lot of
other people's as well it's like but the
majority of what I've been watching
lately so I'm always curious to hear
what other people are recommending and
what they think is good to pick up
during the sale and one day I've seen a
couple people talk about this one it
hasn't been like really overwhelming in
any of the videos but a couple of people
have mentioned it because of the price a
lot of people wait for the vib sale to
purchase like the more high-end like
very luxury products that Sephora
carries because Sephora doesn't
typically do any other discounts so if
you want these kind of more high ticket
items doing it during the sale if you
can wait the two times a year to do it
so make your purchases it's better
because at least you're getting some
sort of a discount on those high ticket
prices now this palette that I'm going
to talk about to me it isn't like
shocking in price
it's from bys art I think it's called
the vines art palettes and they are
twelve eyes shadow palettes and it looks
like they have a matte finish and a
satin finish and it's $80 so these I've
seen be very popular in the past and
these twelve I show palettes there's a
lot of different colors to them like
there is four in the matte finish and
five and the satin finish and they all
kind of have like a different color
range inside so there are eighty dollars
a piece which is expensive like trust me
I'm not appear like that's not expensive
at all but you know I just talked about
one hundred and $69 eyeshadow palette in
here so so the $80 doesn't necessarily
like completely blow me away because
they're you know it's obviously more
expensive pellets out there but it still
is an expensive palette you know I'm
used to paying the $22 per morphe
palette the most I think I've purchased
the palette for it was like $49 for the
sweet peach palette from Too Faced so
$80 is expensive I get it so it is a
good time to purchase it during the sale
that being said once again I'm not
familiar with the adviser brand but I
have seen it used a lot and people seem
to really like these shades they seem to
be good quality once again kind of like
the Natasha Genoa ones they are a good
quality which you would hope so if
you're paying $80 for a palette I hope
that you're getting good quality because
I would really suck if you didn't but
again I'm not familiar with the brand
I'm not super interested in the
eyeshadow palette so two other eyeshadow
palettes that I would rather purchase
during the vib sale versus something
like this or even like the ciate london
palettes but if you
been curious about the visor palettes
because I know when I see a lot of
people using them at once it definitely
makes me curious about it I haven't seen
these hyped up as much recently but I
definitely have in the past so when I
saw a couple people mention them in
their recommendations video and saying
you know if you've ever been curious
about these get them during the sale and
get a discount I was like okay so that
kind of convinced me to go and check
them out on Sephora and I looked them
over and I'm like you know what I still
I still don't feel like I need it so
it's mostly just one of those things
where again I don't feel the pull and I
don't feel the need to part with $80 for
an eyeshadow palette that I'm not super
super stoked alright and then the last
product that I want to talk about is
from Urban Decay it is their junkie vise
lipstick palette so obviously is a
lipstick palette doesn't it comes with
twelve different shades in an accented
gunmetal case and it also does come with
a lip brush and the appellate is running
for $35 it does also say that this is a
limited edition palette so lipstick
palettes honestly kind of freaked me out
am I the only one I don't know but
something about the lipstick being in a
palette I just I just don't like the
thought of that I don't know what it is
I really couldn't explain why but I have
never been attracted to buying a
lipstick palette ever I know there's
been a lipstick palettes at the
drugstore never purchased one I think BH
Cosmetics had a lipstick palettes a
collaboration not too long ago and I was
like nope and then I saw the Urban Decay
one and I was like nope is anyone else
feel that way about lipstick palettes I
don't know what it is that throws me off
so much about them but I feel like I
would just prefer my lipsticks to be
like regular lipsticks I don't know it's
just weird to me so obviously that's the
biggest reason why I'm not buying it
maybe someday I will purchase a lipstick
palette and be like what have I been
missing like this is insane this is the
most fantastic thing ever but I'm not
gonna purchase a lipstick palette any
time soon so we'll have to wait a little
bit to see if my mind has changed on
that I have been watching a few videos
because I've seen people getting this in
PR I've seen that people have picked it
up for themselves and they're reviewing
it
and it looks nice I mean I don't feel
like the lipsticks were necessarily
blowing me away and I guess I'm confused
about lipstick palettes because like
when I put on a lipstick and then I go
out even if it's just like running
errands or something I still put that
lipstick in my purse so I have it if I
need to touch it up so if you put a
lipstick on for another lipstick palette
you you have to put the whole lipstick
palette in your purse
nothing is kind of hard and I know I
mean this doesn't look like I'm drying a
palette by any means but it doesn't look
like a small tube of lipstick so I'm
very confused about this I would love to
get your guys's opinions as well let me
know what you think have you picked this
ballon up will you do you like lipstick
palettes are you like me and you just
don't understand them cuz that's frying
that right now but I'm not gonna get it
I guess I don't think $35 is terrible
for what is it twelve lipstick shades I
guess that's not a bad price and then
you have the 20% on top of it maybe
that's not terrible but for me I still I
just don't understand it so I will not
be getting the Urban Decay lipstick
palette alright guys that is going to be
it for my anti haul video Sephora a vib
of false a little addition I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video of
course hopefully you understood this is
not a negative video it's just me
explaining why I'm not purchasing a few
of the items during in the VIP sale
again there was quite a few items that I
talked about in here that I'm like hey
it's not a bad deal if this is your
thing this is up your alley you like
this brand you like this product
purchasing you during the sale again the
20% off if you do have that discount
it's not a bad idea again I'll leave my
video linked down below for the
recommendations another thing I didn't
say in the recommendations video if you
are making us purchases for the Sephora
vib sale and you're doing it online do
not forget to use eBay I always have a
