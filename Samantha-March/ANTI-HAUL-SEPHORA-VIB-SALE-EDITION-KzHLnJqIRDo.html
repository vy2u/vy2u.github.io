today's video is going to be a new anti
haul video I post my anti health videos
about once a month or so or I talk about
makeup that I will and not be purchasing
this anti haul is going to be a little
bit different from the typical anti
hauls that I do because this is going to
be my Sephora vib sale edition I did
this during the lastest Sephora vib sale
and it seemed to go over pretty well
basically I'm just gonna be talking
about all products that can be found at
Sephora that I am NOT going to be
purchasing during the vib sale which is
happening right now
if you haven't seen my recommendations
in wish list video I'll have that linked
down below maybe sales going on right
now which means I've been binge watching
a lot of other people's at
recommendations and wish list videos and
in this anti holla I'm talking about
basically just what I'm not going to buy
during the sale either things that maybe
I had my eye on and I changed my mind
about things that I just know I'm not
gonna buy things that I've been hearing
other people recommend or say that they
want to pick up that I know I'm not
gonna pick up so that is what today's
anti haul video is going to be like I do
also post a will I buy it every single
week it's kind of a spinoff from the
anti hod the anti hustler were started
by Kimberly Clark and I thought it was
such a terrific idea her videos are
really fantastic I will have her channel
linked down below so I created my own
kind of spin off from that called the
will i buy it serious that I post every
Wednesday again talking about new makeup
releases and discussing if I'm gonna buy
it and why or why not so kind of along
the same lines but I wanted to put my
own twist on it and to be able to talk
about makeup but I do want to buy and
why I want to buy it that sort of thing
so my playlist forward they will i buy
it series will also be linked down below
other than the will eye bytes I do also
post on Thursdays of Sundays and Mondays
so I do post four times a week so I hope
that you will hit the subscribe button
to become a part of the fam but with
anti hauls I know I have a lot to talk
about so why don't we go ahead and get
started first thing that I put on there
that I was considering myself and I
decided against it but I have seen a
couple people talk about them and I've
heard good things
I'm the cover FX illuminating a setting
spray I still have yet to try anything
from cover FX and I hear really good
things about them
they came out with these illuminating
setting sprays I believe they are more
of a newer product it says it's a quick
drying setting spray that sets makeup
for all-day wear and it gives you in
illumination it's $31 which I mean is
you know more pricey for a setting spray
but I decided not to purchase it mostly
because I just went ham on setting
sprays makeup miss I have a lot it's a
it's like a serious problem I used to
not be really into them and not really
understand them and then something
flipped and I am all about them I use
them every single day I love them as a
primer setting sprays makeup sprays to
give a bit of hydration to the face I
mean I'm just obsessed with them so I
just have way too many that's what I'm
not buying it so I'm passing over these
setting sprays from cover FX I've been
hearing good things about them but
they're not gonna be for me well the
other setting sprays and makeup miss
Urban Decay has recently come out with a
lot they have quick fix Hydra charge
complexion prep priming spray for $31
the meltdown makeup remover dissolving
spray which is twenty six they're all
nighter long-lasting makeup setting
spray which I believe has been like
either revamped or just repackaged I'm
really not hundred percent on that I've
never tried it hear good things about it
I hear it's like a cult favorite I've
never tried it myself that's thirty one
dollars they have a chill cooling and
hydrating makeup setting spray for $31
like they recently just came out with a
whole bunch and again the only reason
I'm not doing it it's because I just
bought so many it's a serious problem
I'm like drowning and makeup mess right
now so I'm gonna skip over them but like
I said I've never even tried the all
nighter setting spray even though I hear
amazing things about it I have just
never I've never done it I've never even
tried like a little guy of it I'm
nothing nothing at all so it's not gonna
be for me I'm gonna go ahead and pass
over these even at 15% off during the
sale so another really big thing that
gets mentioned a lot in the Sephora VIP
videos is buying like luxury brands
because you're getting a percentage off
I think that's a fantastic idea you know
I know I mentioned in my video I had
some higher-end mostly skincare stuff in
my video because Sephora doesn't
typically do any sort of sales so even
though 50% really doesn't seem that
great which it's not and I've said it in
my past video it's really not that great
but Sephora doesn't do other sales like
this and they only do the vib sale twice
a year so if you want to try out things
that are more expensive luxury or just
too
higher price point than you're used to I
say definitely buy it during the sale
because otherwise you're not gonna have
a chance to buy it at a discount so even
though the discount isn't super steep at
least it's you know something so I've
been seeing people in a lot of their
videos talking about the luxury brands
they want to buy from and one thing that
I saw get mentioned is from Christian
Louboutin oh my so a couple things as I
was looking through the brand and like
seeing what they had available it is
never even crossed my mind to buy
Christian Louboutin makeup it hasn't
even filtered in here like maybe you
could get something because my brain and
my wallet are linked on this and they're
like no girl no girl you are not but I
found they had lash amplifying lacquer
mascara which is $70 $70 for a mascara
and I like high-end mascaras so when I
was going through the brain that was one
thing that kind of stuck out to me
because I even said I was buying the YSL
mascara that I mentioned in my VIP video
that I said I wanted to buy this YSL
mascara I like higher end mascaras a lot
of times I find that they are worth it
with $70 for a mascara know this girl
this girl I'd do that if you want to do
that you go ahead this girl I can't I
cannot but they also have a luminous ink
liner so an eye liner
it looks cool don't get me wrong I'll be
inserting photos in here the eye liner
looks cool and very intriguing it's 75
dollars for an eye liner I put some
Rimmel liner on my waterline today it's
like the nude color in here it was a
dollar ninety-nine and I love it I think
it's a great idea her like mmm
$75 for eyeliner I am no I'm not gonna
be able to do any Christian Louboutin
even during the VIPs sale and even
getting that 15% off I just I personally
just would not be able to do it so I
would love to know though are you guys
do have your eye on any sort of luxury
brands and you think like now's the time
during the vib so now is the time that
you're finally going to get it I
love to know what you guys want to pick
up because I'm so fascinated like I said
I've been binge watching these videos
I'm fascinated on what people are like
yes give me 50% off and I am hitting
checkout I love it I think it's super
interesting I was really interested in
foundations I mentioned quite a few
foundations in my VIP video I've been
really wanting to expand my foundation
collection especially when it comes to
high-end I feel like I have mostly
drugstore I know that I have mostly
drugstore foundations I really wanted to
try get some other brands going test out
a couple different foundations a couple
different types of foundations so that's
what I was really interested in one that
I really thought about getting that I
decided to pass on was the Kat Von D
lock-it foundation I kind of heard mixed
things on this one and I feel like I
could mix things on the concealer too
but the foundation I feel like was
pretty mixed but maybe almost more on
like the not-so-great side so I decided
to pass over it was going to be $30 I
just you know I decided it wasn't for me
there was a couple other ones that I was
more interested in so I'm not gonna do
the cap on the Lockett foundation
another one that I really had thought
about was the Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation which is 3950 I hear so many
people talk about the double wear and I
mean even still like I feel like I've
been hearing about the double wear it
just for years before I started a
YouTube channel and I was just watching
people continually talk about this
foundation and I really thought about it
I haven't tried any s a lot of
foundation but I decided against it ice
again there was just a couple other
foundations that I thought I wanted to
try a little bit more and I know this
one is full coverage and I was eyeing
another full coverage foundation and I'm
not a big full coverage gal so I don't
need a ton of full coverage foundations
in my collection so I'm passing over the
Estee Lauder Double Wear I did decide to
pass over the Stila liquid eyeshadow I
have found having two such a
back-and-forth battle with these but I
mentioned them in my VIP video and said
like maybe I would consider it because I
was thinking about it I was gonna hold
off for the sale but then by the time
the sale came around I just feel like
I've been hearing such mixed reviews
that I put it on my love's list I was
like
I don't know if I'm gonna do it and I
think I decided against it I still got a
lot more comments on that video about
the selig litters and about the fallout
you know there's plenty of comments
saying that people love them and they
thought they were fantastic but there
was still a lot of those not-so-great
comments and the biggest thing that I
tried to remind myself is how often what
I really reach for these and I don't
think that answer would be a lot I just
don't do the glittery makeup looks very
often I have one eyeshadow on my eye
right now and just lighter I just don't
do those type of looks super often I
have an urban decay
glitter that I absolutely love and I
think I've used it two times I mean it's
just it's probably not gonna be worth it
it's $24 and even at the 15% off it's
still pretty pricey for eyeshadow you
know technically so I decided I'm going
to pass over the Stila glitters really
not too many other eyeshadow palettes
that you know I felt like I was going to
pass over of course the Too Faced
natural love eyeshadow palette I know I
heard a lot of people mentioned that
maybe they'd pick it up I've heard
terrible reviews on this I said oh no
will I buy it I wasn't gonna buy it
I'm not going to the huda beauty
eyeshadow palette again I've seen a
couple people mentioned in videos that
this was the time that they were gonna
pick it up because it's a $65 eyeshadow
palette and I think I've talked about
this in the past - it just doesn't do
one enough for me I know that you have
to apply a lot of shades with your
fingers I don't like that um it just
it's not enough for me right now even at
the 15% off I think it'd be too
expensive and it just is not pulling me
enough per than that I showed up hella
twice the only other one I could think
of that I am definitely not buying that
I've seen other people talking a lot
about is the Natasha ended ona
I shadow palettes because they are super
expensive her star eyes shadow palette
is a hundred and sixty nine dollars and
then she's got another eyeshadow palette
that are two hundred and thirty nine
dollars and know people are like this is
the time to buy because you know you can
get that discounted price that is great
and that is fantastic that you're
getting it and I'm super excited for you
guys because I hear fantastic things
about these eyeshadow palettes but
that's still that's still too much money
for me to spend on an eyeshadow palette
so I think this is going to be another
year that I pass over the Natasha
no to eyeshadow palettes just they're
just they're just a tad too expensive
for me
I saw someone mentioned that the SK to
the facial treatment essence I think
does he perkins has talked about this
brand a lot and use this brand pretty
frequently I know at least I have seen
her talking about it and I saw someone
mention it in a wishlist video it's a
hundred and seventy nine dollars and I'm
like ah there was a lot of skincare that
I really thought about splurging on
during the sale if you watched my
wishlist video you know I talked about a
lot of more expensive skincare it says
this is a refreshing essence that
moisturizes the skin and supports skin
cell renewal and I'm like I don't even
know I'm gonna need a little bit more
than that for a hundred and seventy nine
dollars like what exactly are you doing
for my skin and why should I spend that
much money on you I'm gonna go ahead and
pass over it I I don't think I need this
at this time and there was a couple of
sets that I thought were a little bit
more interesting with skincare that I
had my eye on a little bit more so I'm
gonna pass over SK 2 for right now but
has anybody else tried it and how good
did you think it was I've heard a little
bit about the new Sephora collection
contour blush palette it's a six
different shades it's $28 new from the
Sephora collection the shades look nice
but I don't need any like blushes or
contour powders or anything like that
right now like I seriously after the
sale I'm probably gonna have to go on a
no buy but I've just gotten a lot of
contours bronzers highlighters all of
that good stuff I've just gotten a lot
of it recently so even though I don't
think $28 is a bad price for six shades
I know that I don't need it right now so
I'm gonna pass over that I've noticed
some people are talking about the
sephora favorites i love the sephora
favorites kits i think they are really
good value simply always buy the
lipstick ones that come out and i saw
some sort of sneak peak about a new nude
lipstick one that is coming out and i am
anxiously awaiting that I cannot wait
for it but I saw someone mention the
deluxe perfume sampler it's $65 $65 I
think you get like ten little samples to
try of different perfumes and they
always have really good stuff inside
so Attili air Cologne Chloe Dolce and
Gabanna
Elizabeth and James Gucci Stella
McCartney you know all that fun stuff
it's a really good way I you know
definitely to be able to try out the
different perfumes
I'm not a big perfume person myself and
I use scent bird and I love it I love
getting like the little guys so for me
the perfume one doesn't call out to me
really at all and the other favorites
one is the chic it easy and I think
people are excited because it was $49
and now it's on sale for 25 it says a
multi brain an eight-piece Beauty
sampler set for creating coveted elegant
French luxe and it has five deluxe
products in there and then two full-size
which is awesome again a Tillery cologne
the quarterly be a lick sir I hear the
things about that there's some dry
shampoo Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer
eye makeup forever I pencil a NARS
lipstick and a while-- - chic lot in
luminous ivory again the Sephora
favorites are just really good values I
always highly recommend them
unfortunately and I'm super bummed
because at the time of the sale I was
going through all of them seeing if
there was any that I want it the only
one that spoke to me the most was they
give me some nude lip and I own it I'm
just waiting for a new set to come out
so I could purchase it again so I'm not
gonna get any of the the Sephora
favorites which I'm super bummed about I
wish there was one that was a little bit
more eye-catching for myself but none
for me so I'm gonna pass over at the
Sephora favorite collections I've been
hearing a lot of people talk about this
one I think I found the correct one that
people are saying it's from Dyson and so
they have a supersonic hairdryer and I
found one that said under under the just
arrival section it says it's a special
edition and it's $400 for a hairdryer
and I don't know I've been hearing a lot
of people talk about these hair dryers
the Dyson hair dryers I don't know if
they're talking about this like limited
edition set in particular or just the
regular hair dryers but I know those
those blow dryers are super expensive
and I actually don't even own a hair
dryer like I just don't I don't use it I
try not to use heat on my hair a lot
everyone smile you'll see we curl my
hair but I don't do a ton
I just don't like heat on my hair I know
it's not good for it my hair is damaged
enough I don't own a blow-dryer the only
time I get my hair blow-dried is when
I'm at my hairdresser giving highlights
put in and then she will dress my hair
so I definitely don't need this but I
know a lot of people have been talking
about it and I think even my niece
mentioned wanting a four hundred dollar
hairdryer and I'm like what is this
hairdryer do for you like does I grow
your hair and make it healthier and give
you highlights all at the same time
while it's drying your hair because of
my preference because it's not something
that I need in my life and it's not
something that I use that's why it's so
difficult for me to fathom spending that
type of money on it but you know I guess
I get it if you blow dry your hair every
single day and you know maybe you have
really long hair and you need a really
good blow dryer to get the job done I
guess maybe then it's justified but in
my mind I'm like that I can't I do that
like so many people have been talking
about it and more people are even asking
me about it I'm like no God no I'm not
getting a $400 blow dryer I'm not even
getting a $300 blow-dry I'm not even in
a two hundred dollar bill dryer you see
where this is going but no that's not
gonna be for me alright guys so that's
gonna be everything a for my latest anti
ha my Sephora vib sale edition I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this video I
know it's a little bit different from
the other anti hauls up that I do but
