today's video is going to be a new anti
hull so I have not done an anti haul
video in a while but these have been
really really requested I've been seeing
the requests come in and I recently just
did kind of like a poll where I asked
people what do you want to see and have
people write in their answers and anti
haul was the like majority winner which
I thought was really interesting so I
started doing anti house a while back I
did a handful of them and then I kind of
switched over to slowly doing my will i
buy it videos I post my will I buy eight
videos every single Wednesday I'll look
at my playlist link down below for my
will i buy videos and i just discussed
usually like new makeup releases and
just if i'm gonna buy them and kind of
like talk to you guys about the new
releases and kind of what goes into the
decision making process of buying makeup
for regular girl and I switched from
doing the anti hauls to the will I buy
it's mostly because I was just worried
that the anti hauls were going to be
like considered to be too negative I
know a lot of other channels do anti
hauls as well and everybody has their
own take on the anti hauls I believe
Kimberly Clark started the anti hauls
and hers are more focused on like
consumerism and things like that which
is really interesting
other people do enjoy hauls solely to
bash people in products and brands and
that's not what I'm into so I just was
always worried that anti haul would come
across as too negative but that's why I
switched it to the will I buy it so I
could talk about yes I'll buy that no I
won't buy that whereas the anti house
are obviously going to be all makeup
that I'm not going to purchase but
because it was super requested I decided
to bring them back also with my will i
buy videos I can only feature you know
three to four makeup products in there
and I'm just getting so many requests in
so I thought maybe if I could also do an
anti haul video once maybe twice a month
depending on how they go I can cover
more products that I can't all fit into
oh well I buy it so we're gonna give it
a try I said these aren't negative
videos not bashing products brands
collaborators anything like that you
will see from the video why I will not
purchase these items and the decisions
that makes sense for me so hopefully
that makes sense to you as usual I have
less to talk about so
go ahead and hop into it okay so what
I've done is pulled the comments from
the will a via videos read the comments
saw what was coming in and pick the
products that I know I wouldn't
purchases so I can talk about them in
this video
so one pallet that has been really
requested that I chat about is the urban
decay after dark eyeshadow palette this
is a ten pan eyeshadow palette is $49 I
am looking at the Tim Telia website
right now it says it contains tennis
shimmery eyeshadows from white gold to
deep navy there are three cult favorites
and seven new shades but if you have
palates and singles from the brand new
could mean old this writer is saying
that she definitely noticed more than
one shade that is similar to past
releases this is a limited edition and
exclusive to Sephora it should already
be out right now I'll have it linked
down below and it says they will have an
in-store release of January 27th so I'll
leave photos down here as well so you
can see what the palette looks like I'm
looking at it up close it looks freaking
gorgeous like are you kidding me it
looks so so pretty these ten shades just
look super stunning so one reason why
I'm not gonna buy it I talked about it
very frequently I'm not an eyeshadow
palette junkie try not to overload
myself with eyeshadow palettes it's much
easier said than done cuz there are
eyeshadow palettes that really do catch
my eye I prefer to spend my money on
like lipsticks I'm a huge lipstick
junkie you know things like that like I
love eyeliners I also love makeup
brushes I love skincare so I try to you
know put the money where it like to the
products that really really excite me
and unless an eyeshadow palette like
really jumps out at me and really
screams like okay that's cool then I'm
gonna try really hard not to spend my
money on it being said it's definitely a
beautiful palette but another thing that
I do want to say is that I really don't
purchase a lot from Urban Decay you know
it's so hard to explain an eye it's not
anything against Urban Decay like in the
slightest because they look like an
amazing brand and I know a lot of people
really love them but you know how we
have those brands that we just always
gravitate towards that we're excited
about that you know and to me it's the
same with makeup it's the same with
fashion I'm very much like particular to
the light
boutiques and the stores that I buy my
clothes and my shoes from I keep
continually going back to the same ones
it's hard for me to like branch out and
get out of my comfort zone once again
like I'm trying especially being on
YouTube I like to try different brands
and products and see all what is out
there but again I don't feel like I
should just have to be like throwing my
money around everywhere just to be able
to try new products and brands because
that's just not realistic to my
lifestyle so that's just another thing I
don't have a lot from Urban Decay
already and if this to me wouldn't be
like an everyday palette this wouldn't
be a palette that I travel with mostly
because they are all shimmer shades so
when I do my makeup looks I do like to
have some good matte shades in there as
well obviously I love shimmers but I
just don't feel like I'd be able to do
like a complete makeup look with it
which would make it harder for me to
travel with and just it just wouldn't be
it wouldn't be a good buy for me I don't
think and I mean I mention it a lot in
my videos I mean I'm not well-off by any
means I'm an author I don't make a ton
of money and I have to be careful about
where it isn't spending my money I just
don't want to continually pad my
collection with items that won't make
the most sense to me of course we're in
January we're at the start of a new year
we're thinking like I'm gonna budget
better this year and I'm gonna be more
wise with where I'm spending my money
and I'm definitely still 100% in that
thought mode right now so I still have
yet to spend any money on makeup this
year which makes me really really proud
what are we now like I said three weeks
into 2017 and almost like over here
raising the roof super proud of myself
but those are some of the reasons why
I'm not gonna purchase the Urban Decay
after dark palette it looks beautiful it
looks intriguing the shades look really
nice looks like it even comes with a
brush that's fantastic but $49 it's too
much money for me to spend on an
eyeshadow palette that I don't think
would get a ton of use for me but let us
know in the comments down below do any
of you guys have this palette yet what
do you think of it or did you decide to
skip over it as well so this next one I
have you guys to thank some people
actually sent this to me on my snapchat
and I hadn't seen it yet so I'm looking
at the trend mood one Instagram page to
bring you guys this but Kevin a Quan is
coming out with some highlighter
palettes looks like there are two
different highlighter palettes
is the Neil highlighter in Sahara there
they are both like ombre type of palates
so the Sahara one looks kind of to be
like the more like nude brown tan type
of shades and from what I'm
understanding there's basically three
different shades in the palette so you
can do the shades separately or you can
mix them together kind of like
mix-and-match so there's the Sahara one
and then there is the hombre purple neo
limelight in Ibiza so this one is really
intriguing to me it has like the purple
ombré to it looks looks very
interesting looks very cool so they are
51 dollars a piece they are permanent a
haul of permanent items they'll be
available for online pre-order on the
website January 23rd online at Sephora
January 31st and in stores on February
1st again I'm getting that information
from the trade moon one Instagram page
okay so these look these look gorgeous
III do they look they look absolutely
beautiful and trend mood is saying like
she's using some to highlight under the
brow bone area darker shade she applied
almost like a bronzer or created an
ombre on the cheeks and cheekbones with
the other shades so it sounds like you
could probably do a lot with them so I
don't have anything from Kevin Oakland
I've never purchased from this brand
it's definitely more of like the
high-end almost like luxury brand just
typically like very very pricey append
now to purchase a lot myself from those
brands because sometimes it can just be
really hard to hand over the money for
that kind of thing you know it just ooh
like you see your money going towards it
you're like no no it's a lot of books
for that should I be spending it on that
I don't know so I have never purchased
from Kevin Oh Kwanzaa I have no prior
experience or first-hand knowledge of
the products so I would love to hear
from you guys in the comments down below
do you guys have anything from Kevin a
Quan I hear really good things about the
sculpting powder I've never tried it
myself but let me know in the comments
down below what do you think of the
brand do you think the price tag is
worth it what would you really recommend
and of course let me know what you think
about these highlight pellets obviously
I'm featuring them in the anti haul
video so there's no like suspense here
you guys know I'm not going to purchase
them mostly just because of
money I think look closer at you know
how many ounces of product you're
getting and you know do all this math
which I really prefer not to do in my
daily life but it still to me it's fifty
eight dollars for some highlight shades
and for right now I'm not gonna do it I
have a lot of highlighters in my
collection I feel like I forget about a
lot of highlighters in my collection
because I'm starting to get so money I
have a lot of highlights I don't feel
like I need a new one in my collection
right now and again to purchase any more
luxury brand it's I really want it to be
something that I feel like I'm going to
get a ton of use out of I don't wear a
highlight every day because I don't wear
makeup every day even days that I do
wear makeup
I don't always put highlight on because
it can you know cause like to highlight
the texture on your skin and when I'm
dealing with bad texture highlight looks
horrible on me so I don't always use
highlighter even though these shades
look super stunning I'm gonna have to
pass on it right now just cause of the
price tag and just feeling like I
wouldn't be able to get enough use out
of it but it looks freaking gorgeous it
looks gorgeous that is no lie okay so I
had a couple of people tag me on this on
Instagram to talk about the new lorac
eyeshadow palette called the California
Dreaming eyeshadow palette so this is
$30 and it looks like it comes with 12
different shades looking at the Ulta
website it says chunky sweaters and
Jules wind and white plush clouds the
glow the Sun and your toes in the sand
lorac Los Angeles spring soon eyeshadow
palette inspired by all the things we
love about the sunny city in late winter
it says late winter on the auto website
is that supposed to be winter winter not
winter I'm also an editor so there's
that this soft Universal eyeshadow
palette contains 12 matte and shimmer
shades with a variety of highlight
crease shades and inner shades grab your
sweater sunglasses and sandals and
experience what the lorac has dreamed up
for you oh 12 different shades mixture
of Mountain shimmers $30 I don't think
$30 is a terrible price it does look
like it also comes with a mirror which
is good I'm not gonna lie you guys when
I first saw that I had a tag like when
the first tech came in on Instagram I
was like why are people tagging me on
the to face boy chocolate chip palette
like you guys not see my video did you
not see what happened with the
baby white chocolate chip palette if
you're new you haven't seen it I'll
leave it link down below all my videos
on that palette but I honestly thought
that people are tagging me for the white
chocolate chip palette and I'm super
confused it does to me it looks really
similar to the white chocolate chip
palette I don't know if it's as small as
the white chocolate chip palette but
just the packaging and how the shadows
are and even kind of like some of the
shades in here just reminded me of the
white chocolate chip palette right off
the bat I have already said in this
video not an eyeshadow palette junkie so
I don't feel like I need this in my
collection but lorac is actually another
brand that I don't really purchase from
I don't have any of the lorac eyeshadow
palettes and in one of my previous
either will I buy it or into hell videos
I'm not even sure how long ago it was
lorac was coming out with like their
makeup rho3 maybe it was and I said I
wasn't gonna buy it and so many people
who are like no you need to try lorac
shadows and I'm like yes I'm going to
try them just not yet just I'm not ready
yet I'm not ready yet again I feel like
I just don't need to make the purchase
right now save my money for other bigger
things it lorac is just a brand that I
actually I'm pretty sure that I do not
have anything lorac but I've never tried
their eyeshadows I know you guys tell me
that they're really good so I'm gonna
try maybe in 2017 will be the year that
I try out lorac but I haven't done it
yet but those are just kind of the quick
rundown of reasons of why I'm not going
to be purchasing it but it looks like it
is available now like I was saying it's
available on the all two website you can
add it to your bag so it is available
I'll leave it linked down below let me
know what you guys think if you're gonna
get it like I said it looks really
pretty I've nothing against it there's a
one shade called kitty cat blue in hot
toddy and starfish okay I print I would
like the shades there's like couple
dozen off shades in there that I'm
really obsessed with right now but I
just don't need it I just need to let it
go
there's so many new makeup releases I
you know we don't have to feel the
pressure to buy all of them it's just
not realistic so I'm gonna pass on the
lorac California Dreaming pellets let us
know in the comments down below if
you're getting it or if you're gonna
pass over it it's a last what product I
want to talk about I feel like it's kind
of random but I've gotten a few tags on
Instagram and I thought I throw it in
here so NARS is coming out with a new a
soft matte complete concealer these are
$30 a piece and looks like there are
sixteen shades
okay so it says each has a long wear
high coverage formula with a natural
matte finish so plenty of different
shades to choose from and it is
available now so I'll leave it link down
below so I'm not gonna purchase these
even though like for some reason I
really like concealer I like buying
concealer I like putting concealer on
like concealer or something that I will
put on every day even if I'm not wearing
like a full face of makeup if I'm like
just gonna go out and run errands like
I'll put concealer on and then maybe
some powder like I just have to have
concealer I love it I don't know if
that's like a weird thing but that's
definitely something that I just get get
attracted to but I am NOT gonna purchase
from NARS $30 is kind of expensive for
concealer because most of my concealers
like I do have the Tarte shape tape I do
have that but like I love the Maybelline
fit me the Maybelline instant age rewind
I have a concealer from NYX that's not
my favorite but I'm actually wearing it
today
like it'll do so I I find the drugstore
concealers to be just fine for me
personally so $30 is a little bit harder
for me to spend on a concealer even
though I do like it but once again NARS
isn't a brand that I buy a ton from but
actually I have tried it's at the NARS
radiant creamy concealer that like
everyone has lost their panties over
that not recently but like I mean like
everyone's always lost their panties
over that concealer and I don't like it
I actually was able to try a sample of
it and I did not like it at all like at
all I got it was like I put it on and I
was like I want to take this off and I'm
not like I feel like concealers are
usually fine like even if you don't love
one you're like oh that'll do it like
the NYX one like I don't love it but
it'll do and I'll wear it I was like I'm
never gonna wear this again I did try it
two more times to give it a fair chance
you know I did that but I just really
really did not like it at all so that
has definitely deterred me from buying
this new NARS concealer so I'm gonna
skip over that one but I thought it was
interesting that a lot of people were
more tagging me to ask
and I don't know if maybe I've mentioned
in the past that I really like
concealers and I like buying them and
wearing them and so I don't know if
maybe I've mentioned that in a video and
people heard it was like you gonna buy
the new NARS one but I'm not going to
again I'm just not like super loyal to
the brand and I haven't like their
concealers in the past so I'm gonna
stick with you know mostly my drugstore
ones and my Tarte shaped tape because I
lost my panties over that one so there's
that but let us know in the comments
down below like do you love the other
nurse concealers have you bought this
new NARS one will you buy it
do you like buying concealers like me or
am I just over here on my own lonely
island wanting to buy concealers I don't
know maybe I am but I thought I'd throw
that one in there too because I saw a
couple guys with tags on Instagram so
that's gonna be the last product that
I'm talking about in this week's anti
haul thank you for requesting to bring
the anti hell videos back but yeah
that's gonna be the last one that I'm
talking about for this one alright guys
so that's gonna be everything for this
anti haul video let me know in the
comments down below like how often you
think you'd want to see an anti haul
video I probably wouldn't do it weekly
like I do the will I buy it's because I
just think it would probably get too
repetitive but would you want to see it
once a month twice a month is probably
the most that I would do would you want
to see it like every other month I don't
know let me know the comments down below
but I honestly was really surprised
especially when I put it out in my
newsletter and asked you guys to write
in what you'd want to see me record and
just how many anti hauls there were
really really actually did surprise me
so but thank you guys for giving me your
opinions and your feedback it really
just helped me out I of course want to
make the videos that you guys want to
watch and that you get excited to see
because that makes me excited to film
them so um thank you very much for
requesting them I hope that you enjoyed
this video maybe thought helpful useful
you guys so much for watching and thank
you for requesting the Intel videos
again I will I hit playlist will also be
linked up below please keep sending in
your comments and suggestions for what
you'd want to see in the future videos
