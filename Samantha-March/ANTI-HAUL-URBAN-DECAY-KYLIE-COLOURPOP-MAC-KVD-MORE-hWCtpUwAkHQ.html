today's video is going to be a new anti
haul i do plus my anti health videos
about once a month talking about the
makeup items that I will not be
purchasing I do also do my will I buy
eight series that I created my will
abide series I was kind of a spinoff
from the Anton haul dan tells first
started by Kimberly Clark I always have
four channel listed down below as well
went into my into hell videos but I did
the spin-off series the will I bite
series talking about it's all by it and
why or why not and I post those videos
every single Wednesday so I'll have my
will I buy it to slash into haul
playlist I'll have that link down below
in case you're interested in catching
any of my past videos but I then in
addition to my Wednesday will I buy it I
also post on Thursdays Sundays and
Mondays as they do get videos from me
four times a week
I hope this you will consider hitting
the subscribe button so you get notified
when I post my future videos may is
coming to a close and may was like my
month of giveaway extravaganza I have a
ton of giveaways going on right now from
Kylie cosmetics to Carli bybel and BH
Cosmetics Sephora and I have a really
big giveaway going on the right website
that has seven different winners so I'll
have all my giveaways Wilson in the
description box down below I definitely
suggest checking them out but I have a
lot of makeup that I'm not going to be
buying so why don't we go ahead and jump
into this anti haul so an item that it's
newer but it's not like super super new
I kept meaning to put it in a will I
bite video and then I just didn't do it
I kept putting other items in instead
but it's from Urban Decay and it's the
Jean Michel basket collection I swear I
have seen a lot of different videos and
I want to bring it to help actually with
this collection in it and I think
everybody pronounced was that name
differently so part of me I know I'm not
saying incorrectly of that collection
with urban decay I just really like
didn't have an interest in it I think I
thought snapchat a bunch of people went
to like a launch party for it and looked
really cool like the presentation of the
entire collection is supposed to be
really awesome but it just did not like
trip my trigger like I didn't do a
double-take I talked about the double
take a lot like if I don't do a double
take on an item I don't even want to
consider it because there's so many
other items that I do a full double take
or I do the side I like do any of that
do you go and if a product doesn't make
me do it then I don't even consider
buying it because I don't need it
myself into buying makeup because
there's always so many new releases I do
will I buy it every single Wednesday and
I always have more and more items that I
can put in there it's just utter madness
so our product doesn't get my attention
right away and I just feel nothing for
it I'm not going to sit there and be
like girl you mean that right because I
just don't and that's what this
collection did for me I just really
didn't have much of an interest in it I
don't have a ton from Urban Decay they
for whatever reason have just never been
a brands that I like really gravitated
on I don't have a whole lot from them so
I just I really didn't feel like I was
going to miss a lot from this collection
I believe that it would be a limited
edition as well since the collaboration
and collapse are usually limited edition
sell I try to stay away from limited
edition because it's hard to talk about
on my channel or do much toriel's on
Instagram with limited edition items
because people get upset that they can't
get them anymore
I really decide no interest in this one
but did anybody else pick up anything
from this collection I know there was an
eyeshadow palette in some lipsticks and
the eyeshadow palette did look cool but
it just it I didn't have any feel for it
but did you get those meals for it let
us know in the comments down below
Oh Kylie cosmetics it just came out with
some new lip shades in her velvet
formula she came out was poison very
strawberry cream and grape soda ah no I
saw on the snapshot that she was saying
you know she had new colors of velvet
and really like I didn't feel any
stirrings inside I was like yes I can't
wait to see what colors they are I
hadn't tried the velvet formula from
Kylie cosmetics I'm not really sure what
it's like or if I would even like it and
then when she did do the shade reveal
like those shades are not for me like
ones like a purple grape soda almost
like a purple grey but more towards
purple the very was like I'd beat mob
and then strawberry cream it looked
really pink like the in the bottle and
the box of it didn't look super pink was
when she actually swatched it it looked
very very like pink peach ish I want to
say which is a really bright and vibrant
and like none of the colors spoke to me
at all are what I need but more than
that because I had some people on
snapchat asked you know I'm am I going
to get the new shades and I'm like no
I'm still mad over my Kim
kardashian-west and Kylie cosmetics
collab that took like four
really get to me like no Kylie clearly
like things are still not figured out
with that company and I'm not going to
like waste my time having to constantly
follow up with customer service can you
tell me what my product is shipping can
you tell me why I should hi it's been
nine days could you tell me when it's
shipping Bennett in the video I did a
full video on Kylie and clicking
production was collab
I like the lipsticks I still do i mean
if you follow me on snapchat i often i'm
sharing what lipsticks i'm wearing and
i've been wearing them quite a bit i
like that they're just like super easy
to throw on and i do like all the shades
of course the news but I just I'm just
mad I just can't do that to myself
because I know how frustrated I was
having away for that package I'm not
just going to turn around and do it
again like to me that's just like
madness that you're mad about something
then why would you keep doing it so I'm
like I'm off the kind of a train it was
also is super frustrating that they
launched on Tuesday and before anybody's
product shipped they did a relaunch that
following Friday's like that's just
ridiculous I don't think she does very
good business I don't know I just don't
really feel like supporting it and yeah
just after my last experience I just
think it'd be really ridiculous those
need to turn around and buy something
else because then when I would want to
complain about it and the shipping thing
next time I mean it that's on me now
that's on me so I'm going to go ahead
and pass over the new Kylie village what
does anyone else getting them so Buddha
beauty is coming out with some lip
strokes okay so I was reading that you
can read them as a lip top or you can
read them alone they're supposed to be
really like metallic and even like
glittery and I mean if those the name
really says it lip strobe and I just
have like no interest in this I've
talked about it on my channel before
that I'm not a big Metallica lip person
I just don't like the trend I just I
don't think it's for me it looks good on
other people I don't think it looks good
on me and I also just don't think it's
practical for me I could like maybe
throw on a metallic live for a video or
two but that just seems like a really
ridiculous reason to like buy something
I don't know I just knowing that I'm not
going to wear it out a lot in real life
just it's hard for me to part with my
money for that when I would rather buy
items not not only can I wear and review
for my channel but that I also want to
wear in real life because I I do have a
real
so I just feel like I would not wear
these at all they're definitely not
they're definitely not my cup of tea I
get I know you know people wear them and
they look great in them and that's
fantastic but I'm just not someone that
can pull it off so who the beauty lip
strokes there's a ton of different
shades but they're just not going to be
for me so I'm going to be passing over
them but are you guys super excited to
get some strobe and done on your lips
lensman so this was kind of random I had
some people ask me because I think a lot
of guys know that really likes Tarte
cosmetics i buy some them a lot and I
just really get along with a lot of our
products and someone just came out I saw
it on the snapchat and then a lot of
people's are asking on my snapchat if I
was going to get it they are coming out
with their first ever perfume
it is very intriguing I don't I mean I
just I wasn't expecting that when I was
watching the charts no Jensen said that
they were announcing something special I
get all excited as like I wonder what it
could be they're like oh we're coming
out with a perfume and I was like what
so Tarte cosmetics is coming out with
sweet tart get what they did there and I
believe they said on the snapchat kind
of like the vanilla scent that a lot of
the tart palettes have and the gal was
like you know we know that you guys
thought that scent so much so we decided
to make a perfume out of it and I was
like alright I like the scent of the tar
Palance but I don't know for sure what I
would think about it being in a perfume
but again I do like tart I like to
support tart so I thought about it it's
going to be $24 and available on June
1st on their website and then it will be
an Ulta Beauty exclusive but I'm not
going to get it the biggest reason is
because I'm just not a perfume person a
lot of times I forget to wear it I get
stepford which really helps me out
because they come in these little vials
and I can just like throw up in my
person it's super handy so I really do
like Stanford but then also I just got a
perfume from Kenzo perfumes it's called
the boozy Lumiere I think or something
along those lines if you follow me on
snapchat I've been writing about it
because I've never fallen in love with
the perfume and I fell in love with that
perfume I wear it all the time it is
such a wonderful magical scent and it's
a pretty big bottle so I feel like it's
going to take me
to get through and I just don't need
perfumes I actually just through I've
been doing some decluttering around my
house I just threw away like three so I
think I've had since like my early
college days and that was not recently I
don't like why I'm such a hoarder but
I'm like why not hold on to these I
literally do not wear them so I know
that I just don't need it I think it's
an interesting concept and I'm curious
about it but not curious enough to buy
it if that makes sense but I would love
to get someone else's feedback like if
you guys are going to get this let us
know but I would love to know than what
you actually think of the side like is
it really true to the scent from the
tart halls like I'm super curious I was
going to work and what people are going
to think about it but again I'm not
curious enough to buy it cuz I just know
that it would just like sit and collect
dust with my other perfumes besides Mike
ends up argue because that's this right
next to my laptop so I'm always reminded
to spray it on me it's such a right
front and center because it smells so
good but I'm going to pass over the tart
perfume it's very interesting
I'm intrigued so to keep it rollin as
colour-pop is coming out with a birthday
collection at their turning 3 it was
pretty cool it includes ultra glossy
lips super shock shadows and super shock
cheek for pressed shadows I know people
did get a couple snaps and Instagram
tags on it and I'm going to pass over it
I actually tried to get the color pop
and I love a7ii collection I talked
about in my last video and I said I was
super interested in getting a couple of
the product and when I went onto the
colour-pop website I mean I went on I
wasn't there right I think it was one
o'clock my time it wasn't there right at
1 o'clock but I was there within 30
minutes and the only thing that was sold
out was the one lipstick that I wanted
of course so I was super bummed about
that and I was like well you know I mean
I told everyone on my snapchat but I was
like I'm not going to get it because I
wanted to get eyeshadow palettes in a
lift be able to do it combined a full
face looks because like that's important
to me and if I couldn't get the ones
lipstick that I want it like I had no
interest in the gloss and I had no
interest in the really dark lip so I was
like now I'm just going to pass over it
and then I like actually started kind of
looking into it looking on the
colour-pop Instagram and it sounded like
it was just a disaster like all these
bad things we're going
and a lot of people snapped me saying
that they were having issues with it and
so many people had to like contact the
colour-pop customer service like it
sounds like I probably dodged a bullet
which makes me happy because sometimes
makeup launches just make me want to
tear my hair out I don't understand why
they can't go seamlessly but it sounds
like that launch was a bit of a mess I'm
glad I wasn't there right at one but
that like that just happened the day
before selling this video so I'm still
like no but that's a big reason why I'm
not getting it but also it just doesn't
really interest me I mean I think the
thing that would probably interest me
the most are the pressed I shadows and
the colors that I see aren't like
speaking to me but the ultra glossy lips
I just do not like color pop glossy lips
at all the super shock shadows I don't
think I would ever want to buy another
color pop super shock shadow
after trying out their pressed shadows
because they're so much better so no on
that and then the super shock cheek a
blush I just don't need it so I mean
very cool color posturing 3 that's super
exciting their own very affordable which
is fantastic but just between trying to
get that collab and my kind of a
disaster that it was and then just not
needing anything or not like we're
advocating from anything from this
collection I'm going to go ahead and
pass over all of it but I know a ton of
people are huge color pop fans like
ride-or-die everything that they put out
so let us know and comment below if
you're getting anything from their
birthday collections MAC Cosmetics is
coming out with a new collection it's
the Steve J and Yan EP collection
there's some lipsticks in there and I
glosses dazzle shadows duo's more
eyeshadows a lip and cheek palette some
mascaras and brushes of mega bag it's
gonna be on sale June flirt June first I
got tagged on this on Instagram and I'm
not going to get it
I don't purchase a lot from mac
cosmetics and I spend a lot of my videos
it's just again it's just not a brand
that I like really gravitate towards but
also I don't know who CJ and me on EP is
so so I don't like feel a huge Pole to
like buy it and support a collab
don't really love the packaging it's a
little too found on all this little like
out there for me but again like
everything that I'm seeing there's a lot
of like super bright colors and just
things that I don't really wear a lot
and I don't know I feel like MAC
Cosmetics is always coming out with
these like huge collections like they
don't just collaborate with someone and
cause like a lipstick or and I show felt
they come out with like a huge freakin
collection and I'm like how do you do
that like one of the most recent ones
that I can remember the mariah carey
collection i mean she has like
everything even like a friggin body
glitter or something it was crazy and i
just it's kind of overwhelming not only
are they like constantly coming out with
them but then they're coming out with
these huge collections it's just like
it's just too much for me it's just it's
too much it's too much so now I'm going
to pass over it just not needing it
naturally being in love with the brand
not knowing who the collaborators are
and just knowing that I probably won't
get a lot of you saw the colors like I
just really have no reason to get this
but I'm curious if it's anyone else is
going to pick up anything from this
collection um are you like ride-or-die
for who they are collaborating with let
us know in the comments so I've been
getting a lot of tags on this one I
thought about putting in there will I
buy at video but I seriously just have
so much to talk about in the will about
videos that I thought I could just stick
it in the anti haul conveyancer how I
try to go like boo boo boo or I try to
be quicker maybe not go as in-depth
because the reason why I switched it to
a will I buy a video sometimes I feel
like anti hauls can get a little too
negative and I almost feel like I almost
feel like I'm in a more negative
headspace then I should be I'm also
still sick and like trying to balance
those cold but I want to I want next is
the Kat Von D shade + light cream
contour palette so it's basically just
like the original shade of my contour
palette except all the pans are going to
be cream which I thought was very
interesting and when I first thought I
was like yeah I'm going to get that
because I love cream contouring I do it
all the time
I highly enjoy it I like Kat Von D I
like totally I should totally do that
so it's $49 and you get the six
different shades the reason why I'm not
going to get it is because I only want
to cream contour like I don't know if I
would really use the other shades in
there I mean I know that they would be
probably for concealing but I'm
just not I just don't know if I would
use those other shades I have my
concealers that I absolutely love I feel
like just me being honest I just I feel
like I would probably be only using this
palette for the cream contour and I have
other cream contours that I really
really love so do I need it I don't
think so I mean I truly I don't think
$49 is a bad price for what you're
getting not at all but for me and just
knowing that I'm probably not going to
be using all the shades like even the
cream contour shades like I would
probably find my one like perfect
contour shade and then that would be it
so it's like why would I buy a hotel it
so for me I just don't think it makes
sense I don't think it would be a smart
purchase so I'm going to go ahead and
pass over it but I'm not gonna lie when
I first saw it I got really excited
about it definitely was something that
made me do a double-take
so that's why I thought about it and
considered it and is it gonna be
practical for me as it can be worth the
money for me am I going to use it enough
I kind of went through all those
different steps that I try to do when I
am buying makeup and I just came to the
conclusion that I don't think I use it
enough and I don't think I would use
enough of the shades to really justify
buying the entire palette so I'm going
to pass over the Kat Von D shade + light
cream a contour palette but it's tough
to know if you guys are interested in
this one because like I said it had me
intrigued so Giorgio Armani is coming
out with life is a cruise of sunrise
bronzing a face palette so it includes
two different shades I always have the
photos inserted down here but it has
been two different shades so it looks
like a bronzer and a highlight shade
it's coming out in this summer I don't
see a price on it right now if I do have
a price by the time I put this video up
I just completely lots of fun if I do
have a price by the time this video goes
up I will have in the description box
remember everything is always in the
description box if there's anything I
can't say like prices or launch dates or
anything like that I put them down there
I also have everything linked I also
have my makeup or outfit or any other
details that I can figure to include
it's always in the description box down
below but I'm not going to get this like
I said I don't know the price on this
Giorgio Armani song sure it's going to
be expensive I'm super into bronzing and
highlighting and more and more lately I
talked about this in a recent video -
I'm grieving
or into like palace duo's trios I'm just
finding them so handy when I'm doing my
makeup especially when I'm traveling but
even just at home in my office and I'm
doing my makeup I just love being able
to pull out a pallet and everything is
right there and I'm not constantly like
getting into everything I think it's
because I make a bigger mess and I'm
working really hard and not being as
messy and not being as much of like a
clutter person because it's like taking
over my life and I think when I have to
like get all these different makeup
products out by the end of me doing my
makeup my office is just a disaster
again and I'm like how did this happen
it kind of didn't know it didn't catch
my eye if I break down the idea of it
I'm like yeah I would be into that but
it just it didn't it didn't catch my eye
and it's Giorgio Armani I know it's
probably going to be pricey and I'm not
someone who like super gravitates
towards the luxury makeup or high-end
makeup I know there's a lot of people
that do and I know this while it
channels out there that basically will
only talk about high-end or luxury
makeup and then super awesome i watch
those channels myself I enjoy seeing
them and seeing their feedback and every
once in a while I can go ahead and
splurge and it's usually off of their
recommendation that's just not what I
need and I know I have a lot of bronzers
right now and I am June impact on
highlighters I am in complete highlight
overload so even without knowing the
price off the top of my head I was just
like yeah no I'm not going to be giving
the bronzer and highlighter duo from
Giorgio Armani but are you guys gonna
get it it does look pretty but it's not
going to be for me but let us know it is
for you okay so that's going to do it
for my latest anti haul I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video and
seeing some of the products that I will
not be buying and why it will not be
purchasing them let me know in the
comments down below are you also not
getting anything that I mentioned this
video is there anything else that's
maybe like new or popular that you are
deciding to pass over as well I always

health and then all of my will i buy it
