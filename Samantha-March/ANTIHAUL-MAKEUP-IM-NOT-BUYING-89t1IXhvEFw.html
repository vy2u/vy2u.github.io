our off with this yogurt which is a
piece of tool from my wedding but then
in fact take it off and get an offer at
my nails so I kept trying to shove it
under this and you can see contain good
job Austin so today's video is going to
be another anti haul video so i did my
first anti hull maybe like a month ago
or so and there was a lot of really good
feedback on it and people are requesting
another anti haul video and i did mostly
high-end or maybe even all high-end in
that first video and some people are
requesting doing a drugstore or
affordable video and just talking about
some of the products that i will not be
buying and of course i just want to say
real quick before i get started at this
you know isn't meaning that i don't like
these brands or I wouldn't purchase from
these brands I think nearly every single
Brandon talk about is one that I really
love and I have a lot of favorite
products from them but i also don't need
to buy every single makeup item out
there I just don't do I want to yes when
my bank account let me know what my room
that I store my makeup and let me know I
don't have that much room so just some
of these items are a few things that
people have asked me like I asked on my
snapchat the other day I said is there
anything in specific that you guys are
wondering if I would be buying and a lot
of people wrote in and gave me some
requests that they wanted to see if I
was going to buy it and why I wouldn't i
also do plan on doing another will i buy
it video and that's I think going to be
again towards more like high-end
palettes and releases because that video
seemed to go over really well as well so
but this one is going to be my anti
house i'm going to focus on products
that i am not buying i will give you my
reasons i will explain why so without
further ado let's up into it to talk
about color pop and in specific their
metallic lick I've gotten a lot of
questions if I have purchased the ultra
metallic lips from colour-pop if i will
be purchasing them like what colors do i
want and that sort of thing and i truly
really have no interest in purchasing
these metallic lips from colour-pop I do
really like color pop I want a lot of
the products I have Lumiere to on my
lips right now so absolutely nothing
against color pop but i have seen
swatches hell eclipse i have read a lot
of reviews on the metallic
lips and honestly it seems like the
majority of people are saying that they
aren't super great to be honest with you
color pop lately with their lipsticks
have not been blowing me away minus the
ultra satin lips I really really like
that formula i just recently was able to
pick some up in that formula and i
really like them but like the ultra
matte lips like the one that i have on
my lips today I'm not finding that I can
wear them out because the formula gets
so dry and so crumbly on my lips that I
really an only wearing color pop like
when I'm filming at home or if I just
I'm running out somewhere for a little
bit like it's not a liquid lipstick that
I feel like I can really wear out
anymore which is a bummer to me because
when I first got him I honestly like I
love them all so excited about them but
probably because of their price too but
unfortunately it just hasn't been really
working out very well with the
colour-pop lippie zaz of these days so
that's kind of reason why I don't want
to buy them but I've again like like
looking at the swatches of them on hands
and then also on the lips I'm kind of
like I don't really know what I think
and then I'm seeing different people
talk about him and review them and like
I said it not everyone is saying like oh
these are really bad and terrible but it
seems to me like the majority of people
and the reviewers and influencers that I
really listen to their opinions they
seem to be saying that they aren't great
so that's why I'm going to pass on them
they do look really cool I don't know if
I would really Rock a metallic lip very
often it probably be something that's
like more for like makeup photos and
stuff which I'm totally down for and
again if I was going to do that six
dollars is a really great price to be
able to do buy something that maybe I'm
not going to wear a ton like you know I
wouldn't want to go out and buy like a
Kylie metella clip that I would only
wear twice because it's going to be like
forty dollars after you pay for the
shipping for that but the one metallic
lip that I'm really interested in trying
to get is from Milani because i have
heard fantastic reviews about those the
swatches look really good to me but i
cannot find them in stores and i just
don't really feel like ordering online
because all i want is one lipstick so i
don't really want to place an online
order but i don't know i'll keep
searching for the Milani wants to try
out the color pop mattel like lips i'm
not gonna get any shadow palette that
recently
but I will not be buying it from
Maybelline it is the graffiti nudes
palette I think it's only available at
Ulta it is 999 believe it's a 12 shadow
eyeshadow palette and a lot of the
colors are very like kind of Boulder
it's the graffiti palette I mean that
kind of like tells you the theme of the
palette nothing against my plane
Maybelline is one of my favorite brands
I wear maybelline I wear something from
maybelline on my face probably every
single day love babbling but truly I
shadow palettes from drugstore brands
are not something that I gravitate
towards I don't really find myself
having very good luck with a shadow
pellets from the drugstore brands I've
tried Maybelline I've tried lore'l I'm
pretty sure i've tried Revlon like their
little eye shadow palettes and even
sometimes like the like the little eye
shadow duels I think probably my
favorite eye shadows from the drugstore
are like those little color icons from
wet and wild those are really the only
ones that I feel like I actually like so
I don't know what it is like with with
Maybelline I love like their foundations
and their concealers and their powder is
like anything for the face I seem to
love them but like the eyes and the
eyeshadows in particular not so much so
not only does the graffiti nudes palette
not speak to me like color wise there's
a lot of colors in there that I don't
see myself using a lot but again I've
seen the swatches I do follow my blade
on snapchat so when they first came out
with the graffiti nudes palette and they
worse watching the palette and they were
using it on the models I just simply was
not blown away and yes it is only ten
dollar so it's not like you're spending
a huge amount of money for an eyeshadow
palette but I'd rather put that ten
dollars towards like a two-faced I
shadow palette or some Anastasio shadows
or even like a morphe palette something
like that just I don't know what it is
like a shadow palettes from the
drugstore I feel like that's kind of
like a lot of what I hear back is that
those pellets just aren't super super
loved so I don't know that's just my
opinion but for that reason I will not
be purchasing the graffiti nudes palette
from Maybelline so another IM to talk
about this is from another affordable
brand not necessarily drugstore brand
but this is a 3 highlighter highlight
palliate coming out from makeup geek in
collaboration with youtuber
kathleenlights now i really like makeup
geek i own
lot of their eyeshadows and I really
like them I love kathleenlights her
lipstick and collab with color pop is
what i have on my lips right now in
Lumiere too I bought her recent collab
with color pop as well so when I saw
that she was coming out with a makeup
geek collaboration I got really excited
because I was hoping it was I shadows
and then when I saw in her snapchat that
it was gonna be highlighter sounds kind
of like huh okay and then I saw the
highlight pallid and it didn't you know
it just wasn't like you gotta have this
right now like the shades didn't
necessarily speak to me right away and I
still I kept looking at it I kept
looking at it I looked it up and when
people got theirs and I was watching the
swatches of them to be like okay do i
need this and truly I just didn't feel
the poll for it I really didn't I also
do think it's kind of pricey makeup geek
is more of an affordable brand and this
is thirty-nine dollars for three
highlights like yes they are very large
highlights but I can also spend forty
dollars and get for highlighters in the
Anasazi Beverly Hills glow kit so I
don't know the price seemed a little bit
high to me and like I said just really
the biggest reason is that it did not
speak to me and I mentioned that a
couple times in my first anti hall or
even in my will i buy it video is that
sometimes certain products just don't
call out to me and really if I don't
feel that urge to buy something I try to
make sure that I don't buy it because
there are so many other makeup products
that I do feel that urge to buy and that
I should be spending my money on so I
tried not to really talk myself into
getting products that I really don't
want to buy because it's not good for my
money it's so much harder since being on
YouTube and there's so many products
that i would love to get and to be able
to review and swatch and you know all
that fun stuff but i do have to also try
to be reasonable with myself sometimes
too and simply it just didn't speak to
me I have so many highlighters right now
guys I have a ton of highlight pallets I
have two of the global kits from Anasazi
Beverly Hills I have two different
champagne pops like I just I have a lot
of different highlighters and I've also
been finding highlights or something
that I'm not able to wear on an everyday
basis anymore because I get so much
texture on
skin from wearing highlights like right
here i do have highlight on today i have
on sassy grape from Anasazi Beverly
Hills but I get so much texture right
here on my cheeks and even on my nose
because I used to be obsessed with
highlighting down the center of my nose
I did just a little bit today but not
much but my entire nose was just crazy
looking and so bumpy in so much texture
that I really have had to scale back how
often I can wear highlight so it's just
not making a lot of sense right now to
keep buying more highlighters and keep
buying more highlighters when I have so
many already and it's kind of like doing
damage to my skin so those are the
reasons why I know a lot of people who
are getting are really really enjoying
the pallets so it does look like a good
one I just think it's a little pricey it
didn't speak to me what are you gonna do
want to talk about is from bhcosmetics
BH Cosmetics is a super affordable brand
I have talked about on a little bit here
on my channel especially about their
brushes but they were a brand that I
feel like first started buying from when
I really started getting into makeup and
getting into YouTube they've really nice
products for a very affordable price but
there is one product in there that a lot
of people this is not a new release but
still I get asked if I'm going to buy it
or if I did via or what I think about it
but it is the eyeshadow and lipstick
palette in collab with Shanna so I
believe is how you pronounce her name
and she is a youtuber here as well I did
not purchase it when it first came out I
saw a little bit about it and again it's
one that didn't really call to me mostly
because it has that lipstick palette in
there and I don't care at all for
lipstick pellets I just don't I can't
see myself really ever using it I think
lipstick pellets like something about
him just like kind of weird me out i
don't i don't know i would just much
rather put a regular lipstick or liquid
lipstick or something on my lips then
have to like deal with putting a brush
in it or deal with having it on my
fingers like I just don't want to do
that so the lipstick palette side I knew
that I would probably never use I also
did watch swatch videos of the lipstick
side and I wasn't blown away by the
lipsticks so really I was only going to
use the eyeshadow palette side which the
eyeshadow palette side look very nice it
looked very neutral I know a lot of
people compared to
Kylie cosmetics and her eyeshadow
palette that they came out with and they
say that you know if you have the bh and
shan excel palette you don't need the
kylie one because it's a do i don't know
i don't own either of them and i'm not
going to buy either of them i am also
i'm not like a super super must have
every single eyeshadow palette kind of
girl i just much prefer like lipsticks
and we used to be highlighters at the
point now it's getting more to like
false lashes like lipstick and false
lashes seem to be the things that I want
to keep buying right now but I don't
know just for that reason the eyeshadow
palette just also didn't really scream
out to me I also don't watch shanak so I
know so many people do and I do I need
to like start watching her videos
because I've heard so many people talk
really great things about her but I've
said it before that there's so many big
beauty influencers like it's so hard to
watch everybody in everybody's video and
know everybody so she's not someone who
I follow very religiously like I do some
other people so I didn't really feel
that urge to like support in that way to
not that I don't want to not support
anybody but you know there are some
other youtubers that I just really feel
passionately about I would love to
support whatever it is if I could if
they ever do a collab I like to support
so those are kind of all the reasons in
there I hope that makes sense but the
pellet I think it's regularly $22 and I
see it on the bh website for 1450 so
great deal it's something you'd be
interested looks like a good deal for me
I just know it wouldn't work out and
then I just have one rhyme to go over
and this is a new release it is from
morphe brushes which i absolutely love
more feat love morphe but it is in
collaboration with desi danger and it is
the highlight palette is a 9 shade
highlight palette and it is twenty-five
dollars in five dollars i do think is a
great price to get nine different
highlighters they look like good sized
highlighters as well but i've already
kind of explained my reasons when it
comes to the highlight palettes and even
though this one I was like yeah you know
925 dollars that's a good deal there's a
good mix of colors in there i guess i
would say like there's some like pinks
and golds but like some are really
metallic some aren't I've been watching
the swatches of it and some people are
even like I think maybe some of these
are setting powders like people are
saying they weren't all highlights at
somewhere setting powders I don't think
that's the case because from what I've
read
desi danger like she is saying all of
these are highlights but I think some of
them are not as metallic maybe or as
pigmented as all of them so there's been
some confusion about that but honestly
so I touched over you know why I'm not
wearing highlight as much and why I
don't think i need the highlight palette
but also to be honest I I again I don't
actually know who does he danger is I've
never heard that name and I didn't
actually look it up I don't know if
she's a youtuber I'm assuming she is but
I actually don't know who that is or
what she does so you know I always feel
weird when I say that because obviously
no one knows who I am either but just
trying to say that there's you know the
youtubers out there that I do try to
support their collapse because I watch
them and I feel a connection with them
and you know i'm not going to have that
with everybody i'm not going to know
everybody because there's so many people
out there like it's just impossible so i
just feel weird what I'm like I don't
know who that is because does a
dangerous like girl I don't know who you
are I'm like I know so that's not what
I'm trying to say either and just
looking at the swatches it just it truly
didn't blow me away there was like maybe
two or three shades in there that I was
like oh yeah that's really pretty so do
i need the full highlight collection
probably not i've been wearing highlight
less i have so many highlights blah blah
blah we know but that's why i'm not
going to buy that highlight palette but
that's probably one of the most
requested products that I talk about in
this video and so many people are asking
me if I bought it or if I will be buying
it so the answer is no it looks really
nice though $25 it's a great price I
love more feat I think they come up with
some amazing products but for me this
just isn't what I need so I'm gonna pass
on it alright guys so that was going to
be the end of this round of my anti hall
I really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video I try to not talk about as many
products as I did in the last video
because I know there was like oh this
video so long or I know people are also
saying that I spent too much time like
trying to make sure that it wasn't
intended to be a negative video so
hopefully you guys know that this is not
intended to be negative in any sort of
way not bashing the company's I really
enjoyed all these companies that i
mentioned it's just you know I don't
need every single makeup product and I
just wanted to share with you guys what
products it is that I don't need like I
said I will
doing a will i buy it in the future i
think i have all the products planned
out for that some i will buy some i'm
not going to buy i'll spend all my
reasons i really like that you guys
enjoy these type of videos and you know
just seeing from a you know more regular
person's perspective of what i will bind
what I won't buy because you know i
don't get the pr packages and i have to
actually part with my hard-earned money
for these products and it seems like
there's a lot of interest in seeing what
strikes my fancy and what doesn't so
hopefully you guys enjoyed this anti
hull is well if you want to see more in
the future just let me know ever any
products that you're wondering if i'm
going to buy it if i'm not going to buy
it that sort of thing you can leave it
in the comments below or always feel
free to snapchat me I talk to everybody
on my snapchats I'm just submitted at
March if you want to add me over there
that's the best way to talk to me so
yeah thank you guys so much for watching
I hope you will give this video a thumbs
