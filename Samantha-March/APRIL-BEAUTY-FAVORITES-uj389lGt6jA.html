channel so today's video is going to be
my April beauty favorites and I feel
like I kind of have a lot to talk about
so without any further ado let's help me
back with a little bit random as a piece
of clothing so this isn't beauty but
everything else I believe is beauty this
is a shirt and I just love it and it
says love on it so how fun is that so
this is my new sweater that i absolutely
love it is long sleeved it's very warm
it's so comfy and cozy Oh is a paw print
this is from the company ft la apparel
it's for the love of animals apparel I
believe so all of their products that
they have are focused on animals love
for animals kindness towards animals and
that sort of thing and I just I
absolutely love it I actually was sent
the shirts at me and my best friend who
run the cheeky chicks on Instagram the
yoga account we participate in yoga
challenges and we won a prize in one of
the challenges and it was sponsored from
FTL a apparel so she was so sweet she
let Holly and I both pick out a top to
wear Holly's is very pretty as well it
says like hounds and heroes I can put it
in here if I can find it on the website
and then I picked this one out because I
just thought it was so adorable and it
reminded me of just how much i love my
dog but i can't get over just how
comfortable it is like I wear it all the
time i'm pretty sure i've already worn
it in a couple of videos at least
because I'm just always wearing it it's
so comfy it's she's a small business
owner I love supporting small business
and it's for good it's for the animals I
just I truly truly love that she's a
wonderful etsy shop with so many
different items to choose from like when
she said that we could pick out
something I was going through her the
pages and pages of items that she has
and i was like huh boy how do i pick I
don't know what to pick so I will
definitely leave this linked below but
SPLA apparel my new love sweater I just
love it so next I do want to mention
some morphe brushes I
it recently do a morphe hall I believe
that videos already up by this time this
one is hopefully or else this won't make
a whole lot of sense but i do have a
morphe haul video up and i wanted to
share a few of my favorite brushes that
i received from that hall so it's not
every single brush I just wanted to pick
out like my absolute favorites and share
them with you real quick I do go into
like in depth and each brush and give a
review on them so if you are interested
about the brushes please check out that
morphe video that will be in there but a
few of my favorites from that Hall was
the e3 and this is a very nice like
tapered fluffy brush I use this to apply
loose powder all over my face as a
setting powder and I freaking love it I
feel like it that really helps skip like
an airbrushed look and I'm obsessed with
this brush I use it every day that i put
my coupon mmm what i have is the m500
one this is what I use for highlight and
this is just bomb like if you are
looking for a bum highlight this is the
brush to M 501 is so talked about and
raved about everywhere on YouTube and
Instagram and is for reason and i think
it's only like seven dollars how do you
eat that and then next one i have is the
e4 this is a nice angled brush and this
is what i use for blush and i just think
it is like a perfect blush brush i
freaking love this brush so much i'm so
happy i got it this was one that like I
really really wanted to get for a long
time so happy I got it the e for the
next one I have is the m4 33 I'm sorry
it is dirty I just use it for this I
look just right now but this is a
blending brush and it is just a great
everyday crease brush like this is what
I use every single day when I lay down
my first shadow this is the one that I'm
going in was I think it is phenomenal
rate every day blending brush to em 433
yes last brush that I have is the e36
okay guys I did not expect to love this
little tiny brush as much as I do but it
is what i use to buff out shadows on my
lower lash line and seriously freaking
obsessed with this brush it does
awesome I really did not have anything I
did not have a brush in my collection
that I thought could do what this brush
does I had a few other options but they
were either too big or it just they just
didn't work out very well but this
little e36 is freaking bomb I'm so happy
I got this looks like a five dollar
brush but seriously I use it every
single day even days where I don't do
full makeup and I just want to put a
little bit of a shadow on my lower lash
to kind of like make sure I look kind of
like look awake this is what I use it's
awesome the e36 from morphe then my next
favorite is a palette it is from BH
Cosmetics and carli bybel it is the 14
color eye shadow and highlight your
highlighter palette this is what if it
inside of it looks like this is a
freaking gorgeous palette and I love it
because you have the eyeshadows and you
have such a great selection of
eyeshadows here but then also these four
highlighters are freaking bomb like if
you love highlighters in general Alick I
feel like you would need this palette
you wouldn't even need the eyeshadows
these highlighters are fantastic but
I've also used the highlighters on my
lid shade like you can mix and match
like it's totally fine it also does have
a big mirror up here which I really
appreciate because as of right now since
I moved on my makeup out of my bathroom
and into my office I do my makeup in my
office and I typically don't even use
the bathroom that's right across from my
office I just look out my big window and
do my makeup with the natural life and I
just love palettes that have the mirror
dumb because it makes things so much
easier for me but this palette is
gorgeous i love the gold I love the like
taupe and the plums and a highlight
shades are freaking phenomenal I feel
like I've said that so many times but
they really are but this palette when i
bought it will try to buy it my mom sent
it to me for my birthday but I know it
was only 12 50 which is so freaking
affordable and I think Carly just said
on her snapchat that like after my first
the price is going up to like 1450 I
mean still super super affordable and I
just think it's a really great palette
really easy to travel with as well so
that's the bhcosmetics carli bybel i
shadow and highlighter helped next I
have an
eyeliner this is from colour-pop and
this is in the color maybe it's a really
pretty like bright forest green and I
like pops of color for your eyes are
like super super popular right now and
for spring and for summer like that
seems to be the trend and I recently did
a spring makeup tutorial and I use this
liner and it was such an easy easy look
and then you just put a ton of green
like on your waterline and on your lower
lashline and you just have a pop of
color it looks gorgeous it's so easy
this is the liner that I use for that I
know color pop just came out with I mean
colour-pop comes out with so much stuff
honestly like color pop can sometimes
overwhelm me because they just come out
with so much new stuff that it's so hard
to like keep up with them but I know
they came out with a ton of great like
spring summer shades not only for your
eyes but for your lips to color pop is
so affordable I think this little gel
liner right here is five dollars I
highly recommend like any of their gel
eyeliners in this pencil form versus the
platform I've said it so many times in
my channel the platform I thought was no
no no good but the ones in the pencil
form are freaking bomb especially for
the waterline it stays in there so long
it is incredible but maybe I feel like
I'm going to be using this more and more
for spring so a primer that I want to
mention is from Tarte it's their clean
slate timeless smoothing primer so mine
looks like this I just got a little
sample of it when I ordered um I think
goes from Ulta I read a couple of items
from chart and so I got this as a free
sample and this is what the inside of it
looks like and honestly like I'm not a
huge primer person I seriously forget
like all the time to use primer but
especially when it comes to special
occasions or nights where I know I'm
going to be out for a while I definitely
try to use a primer and I just found
myself constantly reaching for that one
versus all of my other primers that I
have because I probably have like four
different primers and it just feels
really good on the skin but it is
definitely where it says it's a
smoothing primer I really really agree
with that and I feel like it does
magical things to my pores
I was very very impressed with this it
also it reminded me a lot of the make up
for ever smoothing primer I felt like
it's a lot like that so if you like that
primer or if you want to take that
primer and you can't find that you can't
get it whatever the tart clean slate
smoothing primer I feel like is really
comparable to that one because i do on
the makeup for everyone as well but it's
just it's one that i just keep finding
myself reaching for and I just really
enjoy the way it makes my face look so
yeah had to give a shout out to this
little guy the next one I have is an
eyeliner I'm trying to like move right
along here cuz I'm feeling super late
and it's already an overcast day it's
about to be pitch black so we got to
keep it moving the next one I have is an
eyeliner this is from Maybelline it is
the master precise skinny gel pencil
this is what it looks like this is new
at the drugstore I bought it just
because I needed a new eyeliner I
actually didn't realize it i bought it
in brown but i wasn't mad about it
because i do have like a couple blacks
but i don't usually go for a brown
eyeliner cells like oh you know
something different but it is like super
super tiny like can you even see that
it's freaking tiny but it stays so long
in the water line I'm super impressed
with it and I just think it looks
gorgeous it's easy to use and I've just
been reaching for it so much I use it in
almost every single tutorial if you've
noticed this is in there moving on to
some skincare this is from the Mario
Badescu line it's their facial spray
with a low herbs and rosewater I got
this at all so during the 21 days of
beauty when the entire Mario Badescu
line was twenty-five percent off and I
just love this stuff so the only other
like real setting spray that I have had
was mac fix+ and I was getting pretty
low on that and I've seen a lot of
people using this and I kind of just
want to like spray my face real quick
like it smells so good and so like
calming and refreshing and I just really
enjoy it sometimes I use it even before
I put makeup on I'll just spray my face
real quick with this is kind of like
I'll wake me up in the morning I spray
it after I get done with makeup to use
as a setting spray and to kind of like
help keep the shadows pigment
it says once you've tried our
rejuvenating facial spray you won't want
to be without it that's entirely true
use it to set makeup soothe your skin
and dehydrating conditions or to give
your skin a quick boost anytime anywhere
I love it and it was super affordable I
want to say this was under ten dollars
and I think the mac fix+ is like 22
dollars or something so this is
definitely something to check out if you
need a new setting spray you know I want
to talk about real quick is my nails and
i just want to mention i did put out an
entire video all about my favorite fake
nails which are from the company nailed
her I'm just obsessed with all of the
nail her nails and i love them i wear
them all the time i have a set on right
now these are the marble nails in there
oval style they have four different
styles of nails they have oval square
stiletto and squalid oh and my favorite
pair that i have right now are the nakey
and the squalid oh and i can put a
picture in here what those nails look
like since i don't have them on right
now i bought all four different types of
nails so I could try them all out and
give them feedback and the square is
definitely my favorite it's the it's the
easiest for me to type with and I type
all day because of my career as an
author and just being on the computer
all day long Square was definitely the
easiest for me I did not think I was
going to like the squall leto form so
basically they're just a little bit
longer but then they are a square at the
end instead of a stiletto which where
they have like the pointed tip this has
a square tip it's just much longer than
the actual square nails and I don't know
something about the squall leto form it
just makes my hands look so feminine and
I just really appreciate that and then I
don't know if it's just like I like the
nakey color so much it's just a great
nude color I don't know if just the
combination of those two have made me
obsessed with those nails I'm going to
place an order here shortly again I want
to get some more square nails and I'm
going to pick up another pair in the
squat little and see if I like the color
as much like maybe that has something to
do with it but I've been obsessed with
those nails i reused them a twice so far
ever use the square like four times you
can they say you can reuse the nail her
nail
up to 20 times I'm testing that out so
far the most i've ever used a pair has
been for so we'll see how many times i
get in but it's very cool because with
the law of the nails you can actually
paint right over them you can take the
polish off the actual nail won't be
disturbed you can't do it on once that
have like 3d or you know any it like
sort of like graphic on them type of
thing because then you're going to ruin
that but i have quite a few nails that
are just kind of like bear and it's very
nice that i can still use my like loved
nail polishes and paint my nails but if
you do want more information on nail her
i can leave the link to my video in the
description box below where i do go into
more depth the bottom I just wanted to
throw out the nail her Nikki nails
because I freaking love them so much I
also do have a discount code with nailed
her I can't think what it is I will put
it right here if you guys want that I
will also leave that in the description
box below and it will get you some money
off of your order so if you are
interested in fake nails that lasts
forever I have never had a nail her nail
just pop off or come off on its own I've
always had to what I do is I soaked them
when I take a shower and I decide I want
them to come off also come under the hot
water in my shower and actually remove
them in my shower the most I've kept my
nails on has been two and a half weeks
and again I've never heard nail pop off
I type I do dishes I shower at work out
and do everything in these nails and
they're totally fine so nail her nails I
definitely recommend the nakey in a
squall lotto or anything in the square
if you are on your computer a lot square
would definitely be for you use my code
save some money tell me if you like a
mascara that I want to share with you is
from Smashbox it is their new x-rated
mascara I have a little mini sample I
think this came maybe in like a Sephora
order I put it in as like my sample and
just because I kind of been hearing a
little bit about it I was like yeah you
know i'll check it out and at first like
when i first used it i was like okay
that was a nice mascara but like nothing
crazy this is what the wand looks like i
used it i liked it i thought it was fine
I was like yeah I'll use it again and
without even like seeming to realize it
it was just the mice care that I was
reaching for every single day every time
I was doing a tutorial every time was
doing my makeup
this is the mascara I was reaching for
and it's not just because it was out I
have all of my mascaras like in a drawer
and I would have to physically go into
that drawer and grab the mascara out all
the other mascaras would be there this
is the one I was going for so I don't
know how but somehow this one just got
to the top of my list and I just think
it's a really fabulous mascara
especially for your lower lash line I
just for your lower lash line or your
lower lashes I think it is a really good
mascara it just makes them like very
long and it makes them fuller but not
like weird loophole because like lower
lashes can kind of be weird like you
want him to look long and pretty but you
don't want him to be like really fat and
clumpy because then it just kind of
looks weird at least in my opinion and I
don't know I just I've been reaching for
this one all the time the Smashbox
except rated it Roland I feel like this
video is gonna be so long like I
throughout the month I put favorites
into my notepad and I saw them like
adding up and adding up I was like hold
via this is going to be an intense video
but i haven't doing a lot of shopping it
was my birthday i was just the four of
the ib sale gimme a break but the next
thing i do want to mention is from Too
Faced it is the sweet peach palette I
love this thing so much you guys I
really can't even tell you how happy I
am that I changed my mind and decided to
get it this is what the inside looks
like i do have a full video with
swatches of every color or review on it
and a mini tutorial if you do follow me
on instagram i am march beauty word i
swear i've been putting up so many
different tutorials using this palette
the look that I have today is all from
this palette as well i just i find
myself excited to use it and I don't
have that a lot with pellets like I'm
like yeah I'm going to do that look
today I'm gonna use that palette but
this is a palette that I'm like oh my
gosh I can't wait to see like what look
can I come up with next I've been coming
up with looks on my own I've been using
the little cards that come inside the
palette and copying looks this look I
actually recreate it from babs beauty
here on YouTube I've been watching
others other tutorials going on and
trying to recreate them and I just think
it is such a great versatile palette you
can do so many different looks with it
there's mess there shimmer source lights
there's darks there's intense
there's really pretty light colors
there's a few peachy colors and they're
not a whole lot of peach in there I'm so
happy I got this palette I'm so sad that
it's been so hard to get a hold of but I
say if you guys can find it anywhere you
see it come for sale I mean don't pay
like seven hundred dollars on ebay for
it or anything like that but if it just
happens to come back and you see it and
you have the chance to get it I
recommend it because it's beautiful I've
been obsessed with it I love it so much
some more skin care that I have to talk
about this was actually my birthday gift
that I got from Sephora if you are part
of their loyalty program you get to pick
out a birthday gift the month of your
birthday I went with skincare for my
birthday gift and it was from fresh
beauty so I got there soy face cleanser
you get like a little mini guy of it and
then also the Rose face mask again a
little mini guy of it and I am obsessed
with these I use these almost every
single night and I feel like my first
day beauty products are like hey you
just add me why did we hear she like
they don't know what's going on and
because i love using these together so
what i do is i usually will take off my
makeup i'll remove it with the micellar
water from Gagne and then i come in with
the soy face cleanser just to make sure
I'm doing my cleansing I'm cleaning my
skin I'm doing all that good stuff it
says it's for all skin types and as an
extra gentle gel cleanser that instantly
whisks away everyday impurities and
makeup even mascara without stripping
the skin of essential moisture
absolutely agree with that I have
sensitive skin this has not broken me
out I haven't had any sort of like
reactions to it it doesn't irritate my
skin I love it so after I use this then
I come in with the Rose face mask which
feels phenomenal on the skin I can't
even it says it's infused with real rose
petals it hydrates and tones you apply
to cleanse moist skin avoiding the eye
area leave on for 5 to 10 minutes and
rinse with water it's as it can be used
daily which to me it was something can
be used daily it's not going to be an
irritant to your skin at all it's going
to be gentle and safe enough to use on
your skin every single day I just I love
it the smells of these I don't
particularly like enjoy the smell of
our products but I love the way they
feel on my skin and actually I'm going
on nearly two months without a break out
I just noticed one up here and I
switched how I'm cleaning my makeup
brushes and I'm wondering if that maybe
like I'm having some sort of maybe
reaction to the makeup brush cleaner
that i'm using but other than that I
know that it's been nearly two months
without a break out because when i
bought the mario badescu facial spray i
also bought the drying lotion which is
supposed to be really good for breakouts
like once you see a break out of here
you're supposed to be able to put it on
and it will help clear up your break out
very very quickly I bought it and never
had a breakout to be able to use it for
so it's just been sitting in my in my
drawer and I'm like well maybe one day
like you see I mean I'm not complaining
that I'm not breaking out but I'm like
kind of sucks that i bought this product
I don't get to use it at all but I saw a
breakout start to happen right here as
I'm about to go get that my Mario
Badescu drying lotion yes but yes from
fresh beauty I've used fresh beauty
before and I've really enjoyed them so i
definitely recommend the soy face
cleanser and the rose face mask wait
last few products are lip products these
are both from the Knicks a lingerie line
I freaking love these lipsticks i have
been using them so much and so many
tutorials in everyday life i think they
are bomb the colors that I got are in
bedtime flirt and also ruffle trim so
bedtime flirt and ruffle trim i believe
i do have a swatch video of these i also
have several several photos close-up
photos of these on instagram so i'm not
going to swatch them in this video
honestly i just i love them so much i
just want to put the product on my lips
but i can leave my haul video below also
i would say check me out on instagram
because so many lip swatches of these
but i've just been using them all the
time they are so affordable and i
definitely recommend the shades ruffle
trim and bedtime flirt and that is
everything for my april favorites i hope
