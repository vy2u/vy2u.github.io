today's video is going to be my lip pic
video for April so if you are new to
this series it was inspired from Dre Sen
here on YouTube all have her channel
listed down below she did able a-pink's
a video a couple months ago and she just
went through each of her lipsticks at
that she wore throughout that particular
month I actually had a subscriber asked
if I would do that sort of video on the
pink lipstick lover I said yes I did it
for the first time I believe it was in
March and I was like you know oh I don't
know if this will be a monthly series or
anything but let me know if you like it
this video is so requested it was super
requested last month I had it on my
schedule to do this month but I actually
had it scheduled for next week and I've
already been getting such an influx and
comments of are you doing another lip
pic video please do an April lip pic
video that I flip-flopped my schedule so
I could get this one up sooner because a
lot of people have been requesting it so
thank you so much for requesting the
video and again this is inspired by
Tracy and I will be doing these monthly
because there's been so much you know
feedback for them so I will have her
channel list in my description box every
single month because this idea did come
from her so big thank you for that but
I'm gonna share all of the different
lipsticks that I wore throughout the
month of April so in the month of April
I posted 227 videos but I will have 26
lip products to go through because one
of those videos was a lipstick declutter
where I'm not actually on camera so I
have 26 ellipses that just share with
you guys I entered the photo of me
wearing that lipstick and I also do a
swatch on my hand as well as so you can
see them but if you're ready for my lip
pick so for the month of April let me go
ahead and get started ready so kicking
it off with April first I did my makeup
monthly and I wore this one from NARS
and this is called la freak I really do
like these NARS lipsticks these are
called the power mat pigments I have
another one that will be coming up on
this video as well but I really do like
this I loved the color it's a really
beautiful nude pink and I just really
like that formula as well I know the
other one that I'll be showing here they
sell them in a pack with these two minis
and you can buy both those shades and I
think that's a great value as well but I
really really like that shade and that
formula on the 2nd of April I posted a
March Madness video I had so much fun
doing my March Madness series I'll
definitely plan on doing that one again
but in that video I wore from Jordana
and this is a buttercream frosting I
don't hear a lot of people talk about
the Jordana lipsticks it's called their
sweet cream mattes I think there are
pretty decent drugstore lipstick I think
they're about like five or six dollars
there so they're pretty affordable and I
think that they're pretty darn good so
there's a swatch of buttercream frosting
it's a really really light pink but I do
like the formula it's a little bit on
the dry side but I don't mind a dry
liquid lipsticks I like them to last
really long and I feel like these do it
again it's not like my hands-down
favorite formula but I do enjoy them and
I have a couple different shades in my
collection and then let's see on the
third I posted my makeup drawer shame a
lot of people seem to enjoy that video
so that was a lot of fun and I wore an
urban decay lipstick and this is in fuel
urban decay lipsticks are some of my
favorite lipstick formulas I enjoyed
them so much and this one here from a
fuel it's one of their cream lipsticks
and there's a swatch of that right there
so it is more of a nude it's always
interesting for me to do these videos to
see my choices cuz I don't think right I
don't really think about it on a daily
basis like oh I've you know I've worn a
lot of nudes I'm gonna wear something
more colorful I don't think about that a
lot
until I'm filming this video and as I
was getting ready to sit down and I was
going through everything I was like I'm
gonna throw on a purple lipstick and
really shake it up today wow so I mean
there you go but yeah I love the Urban
Decay lipsticks and I really do like
that shade and fuel obviously I like
Urban Decay lipsticks because the next
day I posted one in my will i buy it
videos and I wore Urban Decay on Boyko
so there you go this one was pretty dark
this one is one of the comfort mats
which Urban Decay comfort mattes
like that's probably my favorite formula
honestly from Urban Decay because it is
a matte lipstick but it is comfortable
and it looks flattering on the lips
which i think is great so this one is
actually a bit of a pretty dark brown
I'm so kind of gives more of like that
vampy tone if you will so that one is
Urban Decay on Fuego the next day on the
fifth I posted an empties video and I
wore Maybelline teased which is a is
that their vivid hot lacquer I believe
it is
actually did a lipgloss declutter
recently and I went ahead and declared
that one from my pile so I don't have it
any longer it just it just did not look
good it was very very sticky it
transferred onto my teeth I did not like
it at all I also got some like very
intense comments on that video about my
lip gloss I had no idea people would get
so invested in the lip gloss shade that
I chose to wear that day that was out of
my collection so for everyone who was
angry with that one who safe okay so um
see picking back up the sixth I posted a
collab video with my friend camera were
you testing out each other's drugstore
favorites
so this is the lipstick that I tried out
it is from Rimmel in collaboration with
Kate Moss and this is in number 33 so
this one is more of like a bubblegum
style pink I don't love this formula it
was a little bit too sheer for me on the
lips I don't know if you'd be able to
tell them the swatch but it just goes a
little bit sheer I felt like you kind of
could still see my lips through it and I
prefer something with a little bit more
umph to it I didn't mind the color it's
not one of like my go-to Pink's but I
didn't mind the color but not absolute
favorite formula of mine but it was fun
to try out well on the 8th I did post my
lip pics a video so I actually wore a
combination in that video I wore the
Sephora I think this is called the nude
blush doesn't have the name on it it's
just like a tiny guy came in a set of 4
but this is called the nude blush I put
it on and I was like Oh concealer lips
it was super super light and you know
after getting all those comments
recently on Maybelline tees I was like
oh girl don't you do it so I put on the
Macworld lip liner over it and I was
still like I feel like it needs
something a little bit more so I grabbed
out an Urban Decay gloss in fuel and
that was the lip combination that I wore
I really enjoyed these Sephora lip cream
stains I think they're really beautiful
this color just happened to be a very
very light on me and so I couldn't find
my world lipliner I think it might be in
my purse but then again like I said I
topped it with the Urban Decay fuel I do
like these glasses from Urban Decay I'm
not really like a huge huge gloss person
but surprisingly you're gonna see a lot
of glosses in here a lot of Urban Decay
but I did get them in PR and I was
trying to get a review together for them
so I tried to wear as many as I could so
that one is fuel which is definitely one
of my favorites I do think this one is
really really nice I like the way that
they smell as well so that was my
combination that I did for that video
and then the next video I did was my
March Madness finale video where I was
loading my subscribers I choose my
makeup it was so much fun to do I loved
that series but the most voted on lip
color was from colour-pop and I loved
Sarah E and it is in a repo which is a
beautiful red so I was really excited to
see this one win I wasn't really
surprised to see this one win either but
that one there is a Reba and she is just
a beautiful true red and I think that it
just looks so so good and I like that it
makes your teeth whiter which is like
the opposite of this lipstick I put this
lipstick on and I do like this lips like
it's from NYX and it is it called sway I
believe it is but I put it on and then
like I smiled at one point I was like
that's right that's why I don't wear
this lipstick more I mean obviously it's
purple as well but I feel like it kind
of yells out the teeth also but Arriba
does not do that which i think is
beautiful and then on the 10th I posted
the new palette releases and reviews I
was reviewing some new palettes in there
such as the Anasazi of South glam and
Natasha had known of many sunset things
like that and I wore a combination of
Maybelline lipsticks I wore the
Maybelline loyalists which is a super
stay not in clip stick I believe it was
and then I put cheese on top of it some
shredded tees but I thought maybe you'd
be a little bit easier if I wore it over
a lipstick unfortunately I have to
cluttered both lipsticks out of my
collection I also really didn't like
those Maybelline liquid lipsticks they
were so sticky I just could not get the
hang of them and again just like with
the gloss they were getting on my teeth
a lot so I unfortunately ended up
decluttering both of those I just feel
like they weren't very flattering on the
lips on the 11th I posted a will i buy
it video and I wore a combination in
there I wore a MAC lipstick and easy
babe and then I topped it with an urban
decay lip gloss in 1993 I do like this
Mac easy babe I just think it's a really
nice brown nude which is one of like my
favorite lip shades to wear and then 90
93 from urban and kay the 1993 lipstick
was my first urban decay lipstick and
one of my favorites and I think this
glass is really beautiful as well and I
felt like it paired really well with the
easy babe so there's a swatch of the
gloss as well on the 12th I posted my
Sephora wishlist and also
recommendations video and I wore the
Casey Holmes and Pilate wrote Beauty in
rescue and then also that next day I did
a first impression Friday where as
trying out new makeup with the Mac and
Patrick Starr collection and I used the
Casey homes and Palladio and rescue a
lot of times if I'm doing something like
a first impression or a get ready with
me I will film that and then I will go
and film another video in that same
makeup I'm someone who likes to change
up my makeup looks from video to video
especially like my lip colors or like my
eyes you know sometimes I'll do
something really simple and then I'll
come back and add glitter or lashes or
you know just a heavier eye look or
something if I'm gonna do two videos in
one day but especially if I'm filming
something like putting my makeup on
camera then I'll go and film a whole
other video with that makeup on so we
had two videos that I was wearing rescue
from Casey homes and Palladio Beauty I
did go ahead and review these and a
first-impression follow-up video and I'm
really impressed with them they are
extremely extremely long-lasting but
there is rescue there it's a really
really nice kind of like deeper brown
nude I think it's really beautiful and I
do really enjoy these that was the 12th
and the 13th on the 14th I posted an
express clothing haul and try and video
and I wore the Casey Holmes Palladio
Georgia lipstick so this is another one
from the collaboration and this one it
was described more as a as a peach color
but I actually think it's pretty like
pinky peach in my opinion I felt like it
pulled more pink and especially in that
video a lot of people complimented me on
my pink lipstick and so I think it comes
across more pink but it definitely does
have some peach to it but like I said I
really do enjoyed these liquid lipsticks
and I would recommend them if you like
liquid lipsticks because they're gonna
stay on for you all day long and then
the next day I posted a PR product I
would and would not purchase with my own
money and I wore
again but I topped it with a lip gloss
so that's another thing that I do if I'm
filming two videos in one day sometimes
if I'm changing out my lip color I'm
just gonna do something as simple as
putting a gloss on it to kind of change
it up but especially with those liquid
lipsticks I mean I'm not kidding when I
say like they don't really come off that
easily so I didn't want to be like
scrubbing at my lips and all of that cuz
I figured that I would look crazy in the
next video so I just put some gloss over
it so this is SPL from Urban Decay this
is a really fun it's kind of a sheer
gloss but it definitely has a bunch of
fun sparkle to it and this was kind of
around the time everybody was posting
Coachella looks and all that and there
was like glitter everywhere and I was
like oh my glob lips cuz I'm crazy you
know something along those lines so
there is the swatch of the Urban Decay
SPL gloss that I topped over Georgia
already on the 16th I posted my Sephora
loves list declutter and I wore a shade
from covergirl in insider these are the
covergirl Queen collection and major
shade liquid lipsticks I put these in my
latest makeup monthly and put them in my
favorite category because I have been
enjoying these so much this is
definitely one of my favorite colors but
I really enjoyed this formula I think
it's very long-lasting and very
comfortable on the lips as well so that
one is a covergirl insider again just
just a nice nice nude shocking and then
the next day I wore covergirl insider
and then I also topped it with another
Urban Decay gloss this one isn't gold
mine that was my if I could only keep
one tag video so again I was just doing
the thing where I fell mning twice and
today so I went ahead and added a gloss
and this one is kind of like a yellow
gold with some glitter in it as well
again just kind of feeling the coachella
vibes and I really had no idea if it was
going to look okay what they nude
lipstick like I was like what am i doing
this could be a terrible decision but I
thought it looked fine because actually
on the lips like it just kind of gave
them a little bit of a shimmer a little
bit of a gloss but it didn't like make
my lips gold or anything like that so it
was it's a lot less intimidating to wear
this gloss then it looks like it could
be so I was happy about that and then at
the next video that I posted was a will
about video
and again I wore another covergirl
liquid lipstick because I really do like
these this one is in the shade cake vlog
so this one is more of a brown nude from
the first one that I wore an insider
insider pulls more pink and then the
cakewalk pulls more Brown but again I
really like these I'm surprised that
they're not sold in Alta and someone
said in that makeup monthly video that
they used to be sold at Ulta and now
they're not so I'm not really sure why
that is but for me personally I really
do like those liquid lipsticks let's see
here so the next video was my top 5
bottom 5 I was reviewing new drugstore
makeup releases and I wore in their bite
honeycomb so this is a little mini that
came in I Sephora collection set I have
recently been getting really into
honeycomb I recently went on a business
trip to Oklahoma City for four days and
I brought honeycomb with me and I wore
it almost every single day I was really
really liking this color again so there
is a bite Beauty honeycomb it's just
like a perfect true nude on me I just
think it's so flattering and so
beautiful so I really do enjoy that one
and on the 20th I did a trying out
shades in an eyeshadow palette that I've
never used before it was kind of like a
little personal makeup challenge that I
challenged myself to and that was
actually where I put on honeycomb so
again I just did the thing where I did
my makeup on camera then went ahead and
filmed another video in that same makeup
so honeycomb was back-to-back they're on
the 22nd I posted my Sephora vib sale
haul video and again I wore the other
NARS liquid lipstick from that little
collection I was talking about at the
beginning one of the Power Mac lip
pigments and this one is in American
woman I'm not sure which one I like more
American woman is a little bit darker
and a little bit more on like the rosy
side I would say then the low freq but
it's really really beautiful and again
just a formula that I really really
enjoy it so that is NARS American woman
and then the 23rd is when I posted my
lip declutter so it wasn't on camera the
24th I posted it makeup products that I
wish I would have tried sooner and I
wore the third color from the KC home
simple audio at collaboration and this
is an abscessed and it's a
beautiful like bright berry color I
think it's really nice for the summer
months and you know just warmer months
that we're entering into this one I
think is the most like boom of all of
them like even just when i swatched it's
so easy to cover both of my lips with
this liquid lipstick it just has such an
oomph to it like I mean look at that
swatch it's really really beautiful
so that is Pilate oh and Casey Holmes
obsessed hey just a few more left so
let's see we left off on the 25th I post
a will I bite video and I award the Mack
and Patrick Starr collaboration this is
in hey boy hey I didn't end up reviewing
the full collection in that first
impression follow-up video that I did
and unfortunately I just don't want this
lipstick and it's actually really hard
to swatch it's just a very very dry
which is a bummer because it's a
beautiful fuchsia shade I think it looks
really pretty I thought the color looked
pretty on the lips but it definitely
emphasized that I have dry lips which I
didn't love and it's hard to put on and
it was hard to just make it look smooth
on my lips so unfortunately I didn't did
not end up loving this one which was a
big bummer for me the next day I posted
a March musings video and I wore a
lawless Beauty Cameron now the following
day I posted my Sephora vib sale haul
Tryon video and then I also wore lawless
camreta so I just did the thing where I
did a full almost a whole full face in
that video trying on all the products
that I picked up in the sale and then I
went ahead afterwards and I filmed a
March musings so I had a lawless camera
on both of those days I really enjoyed
the lawless Beauty lipsticks
now have four of them they're pricey so
I will definitely buy them whenever I
can have a discount cuz there are $25
before a liquid lipstick but I think
they're really nice they smell really
good they're super comfortable and
they're very long-lasting on the lips
this one in Cameron this is a swatch of
it and it's actually really really light
I mean looking up the swatch you can
tell it's a very light nude pink but on
my lips it was super super light so I
like to wear this one I'm the best
either with a lip liner look kind of
like a darker pink or a darker nude lip
liner or maybe putting a gloss on it or
putting it in the center like having a
darker liquid lipstick on and then
patting this one in the center is
another way I've really enjoyed it but
and I just liked a lot of speedy
lipsticks so I wanted to keep this
around but I've wore that one for the
two videos and then on the 29th I posted
my skincare video and I wore and Oprah
liquid lipstick and this one is in
unzipped I got this one sent to me from
octoly and I really enjoyed the ofra
liquid lipsticks I probably have like
six six or seven or something like that
I just think that they're really
beautiful lipsticks and I really like
this one and unzipped it's a really nice
kind of like deeper mob it kind of
reminds me a bit of this one from Mac
and Patrick Starr but this one is just
like a little bit deeper and it's a
liquid lipstick but I just really like
this formula it's definitely one of my
favorites after liquid lipsticks and I
really did like the unzipped color and
then the last day on the 30th is when I
posted that first impression follow-up
video with like the Mac products and
also the Kacey homes and Palladio and I
wore this lipstick here from Kat Von D
it is one of the studded kiss creme
lipsticks and this is in bow-and-arrow I
picked this up during the Sephora vib
sale haul I have the bow-and-arrow
liquid lipstick and I really want it to
get the regular lipstick as well I
really do like cap on these regular
lipsticks and this was just a shade that
I absolutely love in liquid form and I
absolutely love in the regular form as
well so there's a swatch of
bow-and-arrow it's a beautiful brown
nude I just think it's so pretty again
I'm a big fan of this formula it's more
of a matte lipstick and I just think it
looks beautiful so I was happy with this
purchase as well but after that that's
going to do it for my April lip pics I
guess that's gonna be everything for my
April lip pics I hope you enjoyed seeing
all the billet products that I chose to
wear throughout the month of April in
and my youtube videos it's always fun
for me to see the colors I'm gravitating
towards or if there's any trends that
I'm gravitating towards like lip gloss
was definitely one for April but I hope
that you enjoyed it I hope you found the
swatches and the photos that I was
inserting helpful I will be back next
month to do my mail it picks as well
