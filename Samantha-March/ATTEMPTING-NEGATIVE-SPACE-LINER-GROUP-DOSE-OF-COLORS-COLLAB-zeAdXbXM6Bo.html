today's video I am so excited for
because it's actually going to be a
group collab I am clapping with the
three of my girlfriends here on YouTube
at UPS all excited for this
so I'm clapping with Katie Marie que
Bella booty and also Jaclyn Rey I will
have all of our channels listed down
below I love all three of these women
I've mentioned them all several times on
my channel so I'm really excited to be
doing a group collab with them and what
we are doing we're doing a collab where
we're each using a different dose of
colors eyes shadow palette so each of us
has our own palette and we're creating
an eye look with it I have the baked
brown palette so I will be doing a look
with this one here today of course I'll
have all of their channels listed down
below if you are not following them yet
I highly suggest that you do and if you
want to see some different looks with
all of these dose of colors palettes I'm
really excited to see what they come up
with to make sure to check out their
channels show them some love let them
know that I sent you but I'm gonna be
trying a little different technique
today and I'm not sure how it's gonna go
so if you want to see me tried to
attempt something different with the big
Browns palette let's go ahead and get
started
alrighty we are zoomed in ears on ready
to go so in a classic Samantha style if
you saw my video on Friday I was testing
out some new makeup and in there was the
Mac and Patrick starts summer collection
and the eyeshadow palette and there is a
very brown neutral palette so I did like
a brown smokey eye with liner and big
lashes and red lip kind of like a
classic look and then I looked at my
schedule for the next day for filming
and it said you know this is next on
your schedule you're gonna do the dose
of colors collab and I was like what
palette was i doing for that collab
because I have three of them and so I
looked back and it's like up you're
doing the big brown Samantha and I'm
like of course I am of course I'm doing
the bag to browse the after I just did a
brown smokey eye perfect so I went to
Instagram for some info to see if I
could find maybe something different to
do so I'm not doing the exact same look
I just did in Friday's video and this
was a picture that was posted but that
was reposted on the dose of colors page
from naty's chap now
I'm not sure how you pronounce her name
but her name is Natasha she did this
look and dose of colors reposted it I'll
have it linked down below and it's a
negative space liner and I have never
even attempted this so I'm not sure how
it's gonna go she also did have a video
with it too but the video is pretty
quick and I wasn't quite sure what she
was doing for the liner part so I liked
it didn't stay in there like now I'm
using this for this and that mat so I'm
gonna kind of have to guess but this is
what we're going to attempt to do today
and I'm quite nervous about it because
like I said I've never done it so we'll
just have to go ahead and see so I do
have the majority of my face on all my
face my my brows I just don't have
highlight and then obviously a lip color
on so I'm just gonna be focusing on the
eyes I'm not sure exactly other ladies
are gonna be doing full face or if
they're just gonna do eyes but
especially when I saw is gonna try
something new I was like let's just keep
it to the eyes because otherwise you
would get to here for like 40 minutes do
you know the drill okay so a first up so
I have the baked bronze palette which
looks alike this if you are a brown
neutral lover you're gonna love this one
these pallets are $32 you can also find
them at Ulta so when I was doing my face
makeup earlier I just used a bit of
concealer as my eye primer and then I
laid this first a shade down so I
already have that one down and I'll come
in and use it again it's like a brow
bone highlight but it looked like she
just kind of created a smokey eye first
with this palette so that's what I'm
gonna attempt to do so I'm just gonna
take the second color and a blending
brush from bdellium tools and I am just
going to work that into the crease like
the moment I saw it I was like oh my
gosh that looks so cool and then I saw
that she had a video and I was like yay
that's what I need but then especially
when it didn't say what exactly it was
she was doing for the negative liner
part I was like if she using a concealer
or is it a different like I was even
like Edition used that shadow look I
can't tell and I kept watch I mean I've
watched that video like 17 times this
morning trying to figure out what it was
she was doing then finally I was like
I'm pretty sure she's using concealer so
that's how I'm gonna attempt to do it
and again this could go very wrong you
know
what was it last week two weeks ago I
posted a makeup challenge video and I
basically was just setting up setting
myself up to fail I mean I knew it we
all knew it but it turned out worse than
I thought so hopefully that's just not
what we're doing again here today
I love these pallets they get a ton of
kick up in the pallet like can you see
that second shade they get a ton of
pickup in the pallet but like nothing on
your face they're so smooth and easy to
blend out oh I really really like these
pallets okay so I'm just gonna move down
the line I'm gonna take the third shade
I'm gonna keep the same brush I'm
basically just gonna do the same thing
I'm just kind of like building a brown
smokey eye here so this is fun okay so
like I said this is a group collab and
I'm really excited to see all of the
other ladies and what they are coming up
with so Katy Marie she actually has been
a friend of mine since before she had a
youtube channel she started kind of like
me she started as a blogger and she also
had instagram and then she started
youtube I think she said she's almost to
her one-year or she is under one year or
something somewhere around there cuz
four she said that that video the other
day so she's kind of newer to YouTube
but I was so excited when she decided to
start her channel because I love her
Instagram and she has a great blog as
well she is so sweet and I think that if
you like my channel I think obviously
you would like all three of these but we
do a lot of similar style videos I love
when she does her makeup monthly reviews
- like how I do my makeup monthly and I
have I just talk about basically all the
products I've been trying out and I
review them she does them - and I get so
excited when I see them she comes up
with some really beautiful makeup looks
as well and she just had a baby not too
long ago so it's always fun to see as
well - make sure to like bring shadows
out here I usually don't bring them out
this far but I want to make sure like I
bring my shadows out far enough so when
I do the liner you can tell that that's
what I'm doing okay so I'm going to
switch to a smaller brush so this is the
Sigma e25 and I'm gonna grab the fourth
shade and then just kind of really make
it dark and smoky on the outer part of
my eye here see how we do so first what
I like to do is just kind of like tap
the product out so I get the most amount
of product out here
and then I'll slowly start to also blend
it in
I hope I'm taking the shadows out far
enough but then I also at the same time
I'm like am I taking them out to the
farm like I don't really know what it is
I'm doing but hey we're trying new
things we're trying new things guys
I'm also collabing with Kelly from K
Bella Beauty she was really one of like
my first friends on YouTube we've done a
bunch of collabs in the past and she's
just such a sweet person and she's such
a nice friend like you know she just
typed me on Instagram the other day she
bought you know my book and she was
sharing on her Instagram and like it's
so it's so fun to see how supportive
people can be over in this community
Annalise definitely been one who
supports me and she's just so nice to me
and I'm so happy to have her friendship
and again like she's been someone who
have who I've had a friendship with
since almost like my beginning on
YouTube so she's just really sweet and
again if you if you like my videos I
think that you would like hers she does
a lot of reviews in there which i think
is awesome
she's also a teacher so she kind of
gives me like Jessica Braun vibes
sometimes like she really does a really
good job teaching in her videos and
explaining um so I think that's awesome
so it's been really fun to see her
journey on YouTube - I know she hit 1k
um what was that maybe like two months
ago or something like that she hit a
thousand subscribers and it was so
exciting I was so excited for her and
you know just messaging her like I feel
like that's kind of one of the first big
milestones to get like I can remember
reaching that number and just being so
excited so when you see your friends and
you know that they work so hard and that
they deserve it like you just get
excited for them - so I noticed in her
video she did like the negative space
the liner and then she put more shadows
underneath it so it really emphasized
that it was the negative space so like
I'm still worried that I'm not on the
right track but it's the track were on
right we're gonna try this so I'm gonna
use my color pop no filter concealer I
use this a lot when I'm doing I like cut
crease work or anything because it does
not match me it's like it's like on me
and then I'm gonna use it look like she
just sees a small angle brush so this is
the Sigma e65 small angle we're gonna
give it a try so I was trying about
Kelly she also has two dogs that are
super super cute so if you like Doug's
she puts them in our snapchat a lot and
I think that it's a lot of fun so that
is kind of one thing about Kelly of
course everyone will be linked down
below let me try to do this liner and
then I'll chat a little bit about
Jacqueline too but okay so I just put a
little bit on there I'm gonna start off
small first and then I'm just gonna act
like I'm like drawing a winged liner and
see what happens
okay so I'm going to do the same thing
on the other side
I don't know if they match up a hundred
percent but that's okay okay so now to
emphasize that we have the negative
space I'm going to come back into the
pallet I'm actually gonna grab out the
double-ended brush that comes with it I
actually do like the brushes that come
in these palettes and I typically keep
them most palettes I get rid of my
brushes and so I want to do decide what
colors I want to do I think first I'm
gonna come in with this one and then
maybe add I don't know yet I'm gonna
come with a third one first well stick
it once to put it up soon so it's not
get super cut it yourself girl
okay so I'm going to put it on this kind
of like flat side here and then I'm just
gonna try to run it as close as I can I
want to make it a little bit darker so
I'm also gonna add in the fourth color
as well I think I'm gonna take the other
side to have just a little bit more
stability maybe with this shade since it
is darker so I'm just gonna put a little
bit on that edge and then just do the
same thing especially on this side
I like really went ham so I'm just gonna
take a makeup wipe and just kind of
clean it up normally if I was trying
something like this I probably wouldn't
do like my foundation and everything
like all right away but just for the
interest of like saving time in the
video with all of that my favorite I
just go ahead and do it so I'm not
really too concerned here but I just
wanna get that cleaned up so make it
look a little bit sharper okay so this
is what we got going on right now I
don't know if I like it like I feel like
mine's really low hmm I don't know okay
so let me add some the liner to my
waterline we'll finish off the lash
lower lash line and then maybe I'll like
it more hmm so for my lower lash line
I'm again just gonna use the same dose
brush and I think I'm gonna kind of
blend out the second and fourth colors
there and just kind of make it really
blended and smoking all of that look I
feel like hers looks really blend a even
around like the negative space and like
mine just doesn't look like that yet
I don't know what I should do I don't
know what I should do to make it look
like that though okay so I put some
lashes on I got a really nice package
from Nikki of joy cosmetics which I'm so
excited and she sent me so many lashes I
grabbed out a parrot from the natural
set they are very natural they were
actually hard to put on because they
were so small and natural but that's
just kind of what I wanted just a little
bit of a boost today so here's what
we're doing so far I tried to clean up
this side a little bit more with the
makeup wipe I don't know how I did I
still feel like it's just too low this
time I like better still feel like I
don't love it
the side little sloppier but I'm just
gonna finish it off quick I'm gonna come
into that first shade and just use my
morphine e36 and I'm gonna put some of
this here on the inner corner of my eye
and then I'm also going to put some on
the brow bone after that it's gonna do
it for the eye look what do you guys
think that was really hard those hard
I'll keep trying because I like like I
really like the girls on Instagram don't
get me wrong I really like her photo and
like I thought I was gonna like it at
first but I think I just need to like
keep practicing and like figure out
where to put all the shadows if you guys
have any tips for me let me know but I
just thought it could be something fun
to try to do on camera together so I'm
just gonna finish off my face and look
quick here on camera I'm gonna use the
persona cali glow highlighter in Zuma
it's one of my favorites right now and
the Luxy 5 to 2 brush okay so then the
last girl that I was collaborating with
mmm yes Louise is Jaclyn and again she's
been one of my YouTube friends for quite
some time here and I really do enjoy her
content as well and she's a fellow villa
owner and I think that's kind of like
how we started bonding in the beginning
is that we realized that we own the same
breed of dog like we felt start
following each other on snapchat
probably to watch each other's dogs but
I'm pretty sure if you will only watch
my snapchat for Aires that's probably it
and she also just got a new visual of
puppy and it is so freakin adorable
every time I see
she sends me a snap I always wait until
my husband's home so we can watch it
together cuz we're those weird visual
people and that's what we do but man she
is not helping our like oh we don't need
another puppy right now not helping but
I also I mean of course I really do
enjoy her content as well again same
thing with the other girls would be like
my videos I think you'll like hers I'm
she does a lot of reviews and there has
some pretty awesome hauls as well and I
just feel like we have a lot of we have
like a similar taste and a lot of makeup
items um so again all three of these
ladies will be linked down below I'm
super excited to see what they come up
with for their pilot videos so that is
my blinding highlight so for my lip
color I grabbed out all of my DOS
lipsticks because I was like why not and
I own five I love the dose of colors
liquid lipsticks they're like one of my
favorite formulas and I think like I
mean obviously like I have a lot of the
same color what color should I choose
but I think I'm gonna use the shade mint
key I feel like I haven't used this one
in a while it came in a the minty
collection so I think this one was
limited edition I don't know if it ever
came back for sale but that's fun color
okay so I have my lipstick on I sprayed
my face so that's gonna do it for
today's video I hope you enjoyed seeing
me do a tutorial with the Joseph colors

space liner technique again leave me
