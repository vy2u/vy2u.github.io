book haul video I just have five books
to share with you really quick that I've
gotten recently to review on Chiclets
plus so if you would like to see the
books that I have recently received
please keep watching okay so the first
book that I have is made for love and
this is by Carolyn Mickelson and this is
for a CLP blog tours seal people on
tours has recently added a new package
and it's called a review opportunity so
in the past CLP blog tours has been
geared only towards book bloggers so you
had to have a book blog in order to
share and promote the books that seal
people log tours puts on tour well we've
recently added review opportunities and
so this opens it up to more than just
book bloggers what needs to happen is if
you sign up for a review up you get a
review copy of the book and then you
have three months to read the book and
then post your review your review has to
be posted on Amazon Amazon reviews are
so important for authors because this is
a way for other people to see feedback
on the book to know that other people
are reading it then especially in order
to do certain like promotions with other
bigger websites such as bookbub is a
really popular one they require a
minimum minimum amount of Amazon reviews
so the more Amazon reviews that we get
you know just the better it is and
amazon has their whole system where if
you get to a certain number reviews
amazon starts to like basically help
promote your book as well and put it out
in their newsletters and things like
that so the more Amazon reviews the
butter so authors have been really
interested in this service so if you are
an author and you are interested in
getting more amazon reviews links for
CLP block tours will be below I have a
few different review out packages in
addition to all of the regular blog tour
packages and also if you are someone who
loves to read and review books and you
would be interested in getting review
copies in it in exchange for posting
your review please follow the links
below and there will be signup forms for
you to sign up to get on the mailing
list for when we have books come out I
am also planning on filming a blog tour
video
in the next few weeks here so if you're
an author or reader or just the one
who's interested if you have questions
on how blog tours run or anything like
that I started CLP blog tours in 2011
and we've been running strong ever since
and I've been getting a lot of questions
and feedback on it especially since
starting YouTube and mentioning him
every once in a while so I thought I
would film this video and kind of like
put it out there and put all the
information out there for you guys so
you have any questions or you want me to
touch base on anything regarding to blog
tours please comment below or find me on
social media and let me know and I will
be sure to dress that in my video but
anyways back to this video Oh made for
love is by Caroline Mickelson it says
that it's a romantic comedy it says on
Amazon despite the fact that her love
life is a disastrous must Joey Watson's
cleaning service a maid for love is
enjoying record profits her crew handles
the removal of household dust and
clutter leaving Zoe free to use her
special gift for memory alteration to
erase her clients painful memories but
although she can wipe the slate clean
for clients she's had far less luck
erasing the thoughts of her ex-boyfriend
Michael Archer from her own heart so
when she runs into Michael and suspects
he might remember her after all she
decides the best way to keep her heart
safe is to get close enough to him to
modify his memory without breaking her
heart or getting caught so I love this I
feel like I've talked in several books
how much I love like magical realism in
the books and things like that so this
one sounds like it could be a lot of fun
and really looking forward to reading
that but the next one that i have is
unraveled in new york and this is by
suzanne atkins and Suzanne is a March
marketing client of mine so in addition
to CLP blog tours I also run March
marketing which is basically freelance
book marketing for authors Suzanne has
just recently signed up so part of it is
that chocolate plus we'll review your
book she'll guess she'll get a blog tour
with CLP blog tours and then we do a few
other things as well so again authors if
you're out there and you're looking for
some help in the marketing department I
will remember to leave a link from March
marketing below I have a few different
packages and it's very flexible based on
authors needs because every author is so
different and what they look for in
marketing so yeah I'll leave those
as well but i will be reviewing
Suzanne's book just because when I'm
dealing with her marketing it obviously
of course I need to read the book to
understand the audience the genre who
I'm trying to reach what message were
trying to portray how to come across on
social media all those kinds of things
so I will be reading this one and I
absolutely love the cover first of all I
think that's adorable but it says life
is about the journey right but what
happens when the journey you think
you're on detours and steers you off
course looks like we follow Sydney
journalist Charlie Cooper who decides
it's time for a radical change in her
life and she moves halfway across the
world to trace a new dream I front-page
headline at the prestigious New York
Herald there is cocky arrogant
businessman Jack Manning and he has
issues letting anyone to close and is
only interested in advancing himself in
his company he has no patience for
dealing with an incompetent reporter or
an exchange program who has no idea of
the New York social hierarchy it says as
she unlocks the truth about Manning and
his empire she realizes all is not as it
seems and if she digs deep enough she
might just find the story she's been
looking for but at what cost will the
secrets they both hold cause they're
delicately poised relationship to
crumble can one mistake unravel their
lives so I will be reading that one in
the next few weeks here because I start
working with Suzanne in like two more
weeks so i will be reading that one soon
my review will be on Chiclets plus in
the next few weeks I only have two more
to talk about so I have four total
instead of five because one book is I'm
also received like an advance advance
copy because it's not even on amazon yet
it's not even listed for pre-order so
that will have to come in another book
haul video but the next one is if you
only knew by Kristen Higgins and I've
read a few things from Christian but I
haven't read from her recently I've been
handing them off to my review team so I
decided that I wanted to take this one
and the little blurb on amazon says the
drama hilarity and tears of sisterhood
are at the heart of the thoroughly
captivating new novel by New York Times
bestselling author kristan higgins a
funny Frank and bittersweet look at
marriage forgiveness and
on so that one is on pre-order right now
on amazon and it looks like it will go
on sale on august 25th so i have
received the advance review or copy of
that one and my review will be running
the week of the release so then the last
one that i have is bad medicine and this
is by Carolyn für dich ferdig Carolyn
fair dick is in the Lizzie heart mystery
series and this is a book 3 and I know
what for sure i have read book too but
now I don't for some reason i don't
think i have read book one but i believe
i have read too which is that old black
magic i can find my review on chocolate
plus and link that below in the box as
well but I I do really love mystery
books especially when I know I've said
this before in so many videos but
especially when they're not like really
scary or like horror or suspense type of
mysteries in there a little bit on the
lighter side of the reading material I
really love those kind of mysteries and
I had a great time reading the other
book in this series so when Carolyn
asked me if I would wanted to read book
3 i was like yes of course so it says
what do a smokin hot detective an evil
chiropractor and a couple of blind dates
from hell have in common Lizzy has to
wrangle them all in the third book of
the Lizzie heart mysteries series
alright says Lizzy heart is overjoyed
that six whole months have passed
without a single murder and the sleepy
town of Liberty it's also been six
months since Blake Morgan heartlessly
dumped her but she's determined to get
over him she slimmed down ready to party
and injury free except for a little
nagging pain in her ankle which comes
from the second book she's also very
single but her friends are doing
everything in their power to fix that
including setting her up on one
disastrous blind date after another then
it looks like a friend of hers is found
dead from an apparent drug overdose she
wants to write it off his bad behavior
after having seen the guy cheating on
his wife with a new chiropractor in town
however when she sees that same
chiropractor playing doctor with another
man who winds up dead she worries there
could be a murderer afoot ok so that
sounds like there's a lot going on in
that book and part of a mystery series i
will link books 1 and 2 below as well as
the amazon linked third book and of
those
links below so those are the four books
that I have received recently for review
on Chiclets plus hopefully this turns
out to be a fairly short video because I
know my videos are not typically very
short but those are the books i have
received if you guys have running any of
them or you have any of them coming up
on your reading list please do comment
below and let me know cuz i would love
to hear what you have been reading or
what you have coming up reading as our
summer slowly starts to trickle away

you liked it and subscribe if you have
nuts and i will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
