today's video is going to be my August
favorites so I have a few beauty and
makeup favorites to talk about I
actually have a book favorite that I
want to mention to you guys a book that
i read in August that I was really
really impressed with and I think some
of you might be interested to read it as
well I actually have a couple of fails
to throw in here as well which I don't
have very often but have two products
that I wanted to let you know just did
not work out for me so if you would like
to see my August beauty favorites and
couple fails please keep watching it's
about the book first that I read so if
you do not know I used to do book videos
here on YouTube before I change to more
of like solely focused on the beauty
videos but in my real life I'm an author
I'm a book publisher I am a blog blogger
I do a lot of book marketing so I'm
constantly reading like you will never
find me without my kindle so I love
reading and I read a book this past
month of that i thought i would share
with you guys because my blog is called
chiclet plus and I can leave links to it
down below if any of you guys are
interested in books reading if you want
to check out my books I will also leave
that link down below because that would
be awesome but I do book reviews over on
chocolate plus with a book that I want
to share with you guys is called the
regulars and it is by Georgia Clark and
I will insert the cover over here so you
guys can see it i will also leave the
amazon links below plus my review that I
did on chocolate plus so this book I
thought was very interesting because
we're following three friends who are
regular girls no one is necessarily
super happy with their looks you know
they're just kind of living day by day
they aren't super super happy well they
one of the girls meets someone who gives
them like a potion almost one thing I
want to say to you guys is that I love
books with like magical realism spins
which means there's magic in the book
but it's but it's more realistic you
know it's things that could you know
could that possibly happened could that
really be a thing I love books like that
so much i hope to write a book like that
myself one day because i just think it
is so so cool and to be able to like put
yourself in that story and imagine
things along with the characters I think
it's really cool so she gets a potion
that when you take a drop of it it makes
you pretty but not just pretty it makes
you beautiful and sexy and glamorous and
you know everybody's heads turn when you
walk in the room after you take that
potion so two of the friends take it and
they turn into these beautiful beautiful
people finally the third friend that
comes and takes it as well and turns
into this a beautiful person and it's
just if the message that the book gave I
thought was so interesting and i thought
i would share with you guys you know
we're in this beauty community together
and we're seeing all these glamorous
pictures of people and you know the
makeup and the hair and the nails the
the message that the book gives is that
being beautiful doesn't make you happier
being beautiful physically on the
outside doesn't make you happier won't
get you to where you want to be and i
just i had such a good time reading it
and really thinking about it you know
asking my friends about it like what
would you do in that situation and if
you changed into this like beautiful
glamorous person what are the things
that you would try to do be kind of
shows how these beautiful people all of
a sudden got these doors open for him
and they got opportunities and they got
the men and women in the books and and I
just thought it was interesting friend
really takes their situation in such a
different way so it was really
intriguing to me that we got three very
very different journeys from all of
these friends and I I was very curious
how it was good to end because I wasn't
sure and I wasn't sure what each friend
was going to do I wasn't sure if they
were ever going to go back to themselves
like it was just very interesting to
read and very thought-provoking I love
books that make me think and that make
me want to talk to people and just say
like what would you do in that situation
well what would you think so it was just
a really good book I was very very
intrigued by it I wanted to pass it
along to guys because I think the
message and there is very important and
definitely one to think about so I'll
leave the links to the regulars down
below some skin care that I want to talk
about this is from road I'll Rodale I'm
really not sure but it's their stem cell
cleansing cream so this is what it looks
like and
this was sent to me in one of my FC bags
it says it's a two-on-one cleanser and
mask for dehydrated skin with stem cells
rose hip and vitamin E so it says that
you can either use it like you put it on
leave it sit for a few minutes and then
wash it off or you can actually leave it
on for up to 15 minutes and use it as
more of a mask this stuff smells so good
and so like soothing almost I don't know
it smells so good and I just love the
way it feels I just want to smell it
because I'm weird like that I love the
way it feels on the skin it feels very
like thick and creamy and like it's just
moisturizing everything and my skin
feels so hydrated after i use it and
i've just been kind of obsessed with it
at night when i'm going through my skin
care and what it is that I'm looking for
I just keep finding myself reaching for
this and is a little bottle so I know
I'm going to run out of it sometime soon
and it makes me really sad because I
just I'm really loving this stuff I'm
not very familiar with the road I'll
brand but I'm gonna have to look them up
another item that I've actually own this
for a while and I never really thought
it was a favorite then I started using
it again recently and I was like we just
like it I love this so it is the secret
brightening powder from Laura Mercier I
picked owing up at Sephora so this is
not her translucent powder that everyone
talks about and raised about when I was
getting ready to purchase this I was
like you know what I want the secret
brightening powder because I like having
the bright under eyes it's just like
what I'm more attracted to and it was a
smaller guy and it was a little bit more
inexpensive so I was like that's what
I'm going to go with and so I got it and
I liked it just fine a while after that
i bought the maybelline powder and i was
like i really like the maybelline powder
and i started using that more but
recently I went back to trying this
again and I was like wait a second why
didn't I think I loved this cuz I love
it I don't know what it is maybe I just
needed to like set it aside for a while
but now that I've been using it again I
don't want to stop using it i think is
fantastic it's really nice for baking on
the under eyes but then like it says it
also brightens them up and are there
which i love the bright under eyes look
it just applies so well it doesn't give
me the white cast because the maybelline
one sometimes if i go like really heavy
handed with a maple leaf powder it will
leave me the the white flash back when I
use like flash photography which really
sucks but this one I don't find that it
does it at all so that's really good for
me I do want to try out the translucent
powder I'm thinking about maybe getting
it and the next time i purchased from
sephora maybe just because i've recently
been like okay i really do like this i
do only use this on my under eyes I
don't put this anywhere else on my face
so that's why I'm thinking of maybe
getting the other one as well but yeah
the secret brightening powder m.phil by
him loves my favorite lip combination of
this month and if you guys follow me on
instagram you'll probably like yeah we
already know that is a whirl from mac
cosmetics and then bow and arrow from
kat von d i'm not a huge lip liner
person like i don't need to wear at lip
liner every time I don't think that you
need lip liner with Kat Von D's liquid
lipsticks but the two of them together
make it excellent combination but in
particular bow and arrow has just been
my jam this past month to the point
where I was wearing it so much that I
was every time I was going to post a
picture on Instagram and I was tagging
kat von d bow and arrow I'm like girl
you need to wear something else on your
lips but bow and arrow is such a
beautiful like brown nude color and it
almost pulls more like brown nude pink
on me like and that's what so many
people say when I post pictures of it
they're like why is your cell pink I'm
like I don't know that's just kind of
the way it pulls on me but especially
when I match it with the whorl which
that definitely is probably the biggest
reason because world has a little bit of
pink in it I think and so when you
combine the two together I think that's
why bow and arrow is looking more pink
on me than it is like brown are nude but
world is a really beautiful lip liner
it's actually my very first item that I
ever purchased from mac cosmetics was a
swirl lip liner because youtube made me
do it touch it so you guys can see what
i'm talking about but that is world
right there yes favorite color
combination i love love love this from
kat von d like when bow and arrow runs
out which I went out whose press foes
anytime soon because that's how much I
wear it I need to get another one like
my favorite favorite nude a pair of
lashes
these are the grand glamour lashes from
Vegas night and i lure and the one lash
like will not stay up that's what it
looks like if you guys can see at the /
refuses to stay put like that one but I
have also bought the i lure in Vegas my
lashes in shining star and I liked them
just fine i didn't think there anything
super crazy to talk about I didn't reach
for them a whole lot but I liked him
enough but so many would people will
talk about these grand glamour lashes
and I realized that they were always
sold out like whenever I went to alter
our target the shining star would always
be there but never the Korean glamour
and one time I was at target and I saw
my salt one pair and I was like you know
what I'm going to get him just because
so many people talk about them and I see
they're always sold out so like why not
get them I understand why everyone talks
about these grandma Glamour's they are
beautiful very like kind of over-the-top
if you're much more of like a natural
lash person you are going to hate these
you you are not going to like them at
all they are very dramatic very baba
boom they're almost like double stacked
lashes so they're very very full but I
love the band on this one and it's just
it's a thicker band which sometimes I
hear people complaining about thicker
eyelash bands but I actually don't find
them because I find them easier to put
on and I don't know what it is with this
band you guys but I have no problems
putting these lashes on these are
probably the easiest lashes I have ever
put on and sometimes i can say that
after i try lashes like one or two times
and you have a fresh band and you don't
have like adhesive that's built up I'm
like yeah those lectures were so easy to
put on I have worn these at least 10
times at least but probably much more
and I'm still having no issues just boom
read on it's amazing it's crazy I love
how dramatic they are helpful they are
I'm definitely going to need to get more
of the grant Glamour's so the last
favorite that I want to talk to you guys
about is a foot exfoliating mask so this
was actually sent to me from the company
grace and Stella I have worked with
grace and Stella previously they sent me
their eye masks they have a wonderful
wonderful gel eye mask I'm
pretty sure I've mentioned them in a
favorites video as well I will leave
them linked down below but I are
fantastic like very cooling eye masks
that I love using them in the morning as
things they're fantastic Grayson's dala
actually reached out to me again and
they asked you know could we send you
something else from our store if you
want to test it out and I was like sure
so that I looked over their store and I
was like maybe send me the exfoliating
foot mask like in my mind I was like
it's probably not gonna do anything
because I've had other companies send me
these types of foot masks before and
nothing happens but that was like you
know why now they've always wanted one
of these to actually work so why not um
this video is not sponsored gerson
stella is not paying me to talk about
this product or print this video or
anything like that they actually don't
know that I'm including this in a
favorites video send me this foot its
full eating mask so this is what the box
looks like it came one pair for your
feet so basically what I did and I put
this all on my snapchat as well they
like walked you guys through it there's
like these plastic booties that you put
on your feet and then inside is like a
cloth and it's saturated with actual
product at the mask so you put the
booties on you kind of seal them up and
then I put socks over it and then you
have to leave it sit for one hour and
after that one hour took the socks off
check the booties off threw them away
wash my feet as instructed and then it
says dead skin cells will begin to peel
from five to seven days after the
initial application and I'm like okay
okay so the next day I don't see
anything you know day too I don't see
anything day 3 nothing but I'm not like
oh no what I realized afterwards even
though I wasn't seeing any like dead
skin cells happen like my feet felt
different they kind of felt tight and
they almost kind of felt slippery like
no matter what kind of surface it was I
was walking on I was like I feel like
I'm gonna fall like it was it was a very
very bizarre feeling but I it made me
really excited because I was like okay
something has to be happening like when
I've used these masks in the past I have
seen no difference felt no difference
like this has to be a good sign right I
play sand volleyball on Friday nights
and I think I had done this mask on
Monday so flash forward to that friday
and i'm standing on the courts and I
looked down at my feet I'm like what is
on my foot and I live
my foot up to like try to tap whatever
it is that's on my foot away and I
realize it's the dead skin cells peeling
off so then I picked my foot up and I
was so shocked and then I went around
and had to show everybody my feet
because my feet were peeling like crazy
it was the weirdest thing i've ever seen
and i will insert a picture for you guys
but I want to like warn you for if you
don't want to see feet I warned you
before i go to put this picture in but
it was literally so bizarre and my feet
peeled for probably four days or so like
the skin cells were still peeling off my
foot so it was like I didn't really want
to wear it flip-flops that's mostly like
trying to wear my tennis shoes or like
hiding my feet because it was peeling
like crazy so to show to you guys to
prove you guys when I'm talking about I
took a picture of my foot I will insert
that picture here so why don't you guys
know if you don't want to see a picture
of my foot if you don't want to see a
picture of my foot peeling off dead skin
cells look down right now are you
looking down ok so here is the picture
of my foot is that not insane like tell
me that isn't crazy ok you guys can all
look again and I sent it to my friend
and she's like well your feet are really
pink quartz peeling like do your feet
hurt and it doesn't and I think maybe
it's because I had the flash on because
actually in person it wasn't that pink
so I don't know maybe it was because i
was taking it so late at night that i
had to use the flash but my feet did not
hurt i know some people have used this
mask and said like the areas that peeled
were kind of tender I didn't get that
feeling at all um I really didn't feel
any pain any sort of like tender areas
anything like that nothing bothered me
at all but so my feet it's been about
two days now since the peeling process
has stopped my feet feel so smooth they
look better you know like the areas
around like your big toe and like your
heels and they always have those like
calluses in the dead skin that's like
built up of there it's gone and my feet
look so nice it is crazy I cannot
believe this worked like I cannot
believe this worked because I have
I so many others and nothing has worked
so this one blew me away and I can't
stop telling people about it and now
we're always going to have that picture
on my phone so I could be like you need
proof like here's proof that really did
work because so I just thought that was
really really cool and also Grayson
Stella has given me a coupon code and
you can use it on anything in the store
as well and I can't remember the coupon
code is right now but I will put it
right here on the screen and it will
also be in the description box below I
will link these and I'll link the eye
masks that I really love as well I
believe my code is good for twenty
percent off too so if you want to try
this out I would definitely recommend it
get it take some money off get the eye
mask while you're at it because I think
they're amazing but dang like this blew
my mind I have two products that I want
to mention that just absolutely did not
work out for me this month and it's
funny because of one I actually ended up
throwing away and I kept having it on my
desk because I reminder you know don't
throw this away because you're going to
talk about it in your video and then I
went on like a crazy cleaning
reorganizing spree last weekend and sit
up throwing it away but basically all it
was with like a selfie ring light and it
was from like oxen on I can link it
below from amazon if anyone's real
curious to look at it but it really
wasn't sure how to pronounce the name
but it was just a little ring light I
showed it on my snapchat and supposed to
be able to like hook onto your phone
basically it's a light so you have
better picture taking quality and things
like that and a lot of people said you
could actually clip it to your
viewfinder on your camera to use it as
like a very small ring light from when
recording videos you're supposed to get
better lighting from it and I was like
okay cool and had three different
settings you could click the little
button to make it bright brighter and
then brightest and it just did not work
I really didn't see any difference at
all when I put it on my viewfinder I
tried there was absolutely zero
difference I didn't see much of a
difference when taking pictures but then
after three times of trying to use it it
just stopped working completely didn't
turn on didn't do anything I switch to
the batteries out even though the
batteries i put in it were brand new
batteries i gave it new batteries still
didn't work so i emailed the company
via Amazon and they refunded me my money
it was only twenty dollars but at the
same time I was like okay so that was
really really stupid and I was a little
frustrated because I paid twenty dollars
for this like little ring light and to
get like nice studio lights like these
soft boxes on Amazon you can get two of
them for eighty dollars and their actual
like big lights and they do make a
difference in your lighting so I was
like I just would have made a lot more
sense to just go with those but I was
always trying to like find ways to save
money and all this stuff but then ended
up not working at all it was pretty much
a disaster but I don't know if you guys
can kind of tell like a bit of a
different background I mean not really
because i'm still in my office but I
just have my chair pushed way up in the
center of my room so I like I am right
in front of my window like I used to be
sitting back there next to the desk and
now I'm more towards right in the window
because I've better lighting but I
really do need to get some sort of
lighting because I keep having I keep
finding myself only having like one to
two hours of a really good light to be
able to film and you know I'm trying to
film a video every single day so I
really need something to help me out
there so i think i'm going to get a
different set of lights i can link those
down below the ones that i have in my
card it's eighty dollars for two soft
boxes so i think that's what i'm going
to go with but that light ended up being
straight awful an APR package from Max
Factor they were doing a new like
capsule collection I talked about it in
one of my haul videos an eyeliner and
mascara and two lipsticks in there and
it was like in collaboration with Pat
McGrath I was really excited to get the
box and to try out the products the
mascara I really like just fine the
lipsticks I think are ok like nothing
that's belong to me away but I tried
this precision eyeliner and I love
eyeliner I'm an eyeliner junkie I love
trying out new eyeliners this was a
black liquid liner and I was like cool
this is for me I actually tried it I was
filming a like Instagram tutorial video
because I've been trying to do more of
those I was filming that and it was the
day that we were going to the Iowa State
Fair so not even a day where I'm just
sitting at my house doing my makeup to
talk to a camera like we were actually
going out in public with friends
and I was like I'll use this eyeliner
I'll try it out it'll be amazing oh it
was not amazing I mean if you want like
a day runner and a night runner like I
remember my husband kept coming into my
office and he's like are you ready yet
are you ready yet and i was like no i'm
trying so hard to fix this eyeliner like
I wiped it all off on the sides I knew I
like I pretty much wiped the entire eye
liner off like on my eyelid like oh my
gosh it was just it was such a disaster
so I opened it up and I was like okay so
this is like a really interesting
applicator because it's like really flat
and thick on one side and then super
thin but still flat on the other side
but when you use it first it goes on
like a permanent marker like it has like
the weirdest feel to it has a very
strange look to it it was not good even
when I went to like draw out a wing and
using the really flat side it still was
like super super bold like you couldn't
really create like a small wing with it
it just it was such a disaster I usually
I'm like okay you know probably didn't
work out once i can try it again and see
you know maybe try a different technique
or something like I will not try this
again I refused to try this again
because it just did adjusted horrible
things so that was a really big bummer
but like I said I actually ended up
really liking the mascara the lipsticks
I don't think our anything to write home
about but this high precision liquid
eyeliner was no good I guess that's
going to be everything for my August
favorites and a couple fails thrown in
there I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this video I would love to know
what you have been living on during the
month of August if you did enjoy this
video please do give it a thumbs up make
sure you are subscribed before you go
and I will get you real soon in my next
one I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
