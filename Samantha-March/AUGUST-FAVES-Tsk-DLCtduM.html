today's video is going to be my August
beauty and lifestyle favorites I'm sorry
I am still recovering from this like
crazy cold infection that's knocked me
out basically all week so I still sound
really congested and that's because I am
but I'm feeling a lot better I'm
actually able to like be up during the
day and actually be working which is
great but still just a little exhausted
this video is all about my favorites I
honestly really don't have that money so
maybe it'll be a quick video we'll see
but if you would like to see my beauty
and lifestyle favorites for the month of
August please keep watching first thing
that I want to mention is actually a
book yeah I would do the books in their
own separate book favorites video but
those books are for all the five-star
books that we review on Chiclets plus
and this book is just a little bit
different because it is my own it is the
book that i released july twenty ninth
so obviously a tardy record in my july
favorites video so including this in
august and we don't typically review
marching Hank books on chocolate plus we
did a while back and I think I've pretty
much stopped it just because they're
kind of biased just so usually I keep
them off the website but I did want to
mention it because this is my own book
this is my fourth book baby it is called
up to i do i'm really proud of it and i
also wanted to mention it because the
cover is my personal wedding photo as on
the back there's like a black-and-white
shot that kind of have to look closely
between the text but that's another
wedding photo of ours it's just made my
husband holding hands and we just
celebrated our two year wedding
anniversary so like that's a favorite
the books a favorite and i just i
absolutely love this cover we actually
have this wedding picture of ours on
like a really big canvas print in our
bedroom so it's one of my favorite
pictures also happy to be able to use it
on my cover but if you have now gotten
your copy yet of up to i do i hope that
you get it because is for sale on amazon
barnes and noble and kobo and of course
all the links will be in the description
box below kind of going along with that
I got an
you tank top that I have been wearing so
much and I actually wore it in a video
I'm not exactly sure which video I wore
it in but it is just like the simple
white tank top but it says wifey on it
if you guys can see how it says wifey
and it has a little heart over the I i
have just been wearing it non-stop I
think it's so cute and I clearly love my
role is wife and you know even though
we've been married for two years even
sometimes still when I like say oh I
went out with my husband like it still
is just kind of exciting I don't know I
know that we're not considered newlyweds
anymore but it's only been two years so
I feel like we kill still can be but as
anyone else have that feeling anyone
else like newly married but you still
get like crazed out when you say like
husband or wife or have you been married
for several years and you still get that
feeling like does it ever go away is it
always still exciting but I just love it
I got it on zulily and honestly that was
my first time ordering from zulily it
just like popped up on my facebook page
i'm pretty sure with this tank and i was
like oh I should really get that so I
did and I'm really happy that I got it
but it took three weeks to get delivered
to me which I thought was pretty extreme
when so many places have like 35 day
shipping or whatever if this took
legitimately three weeks and I looked a
little bit closer into zulily and
basically it's like you order from
zulily but then zulily has to place the
order with the company who is making
your product and they ship it to zulily
and then similarly ships it to you I was
like what that just sounds like a hot
mess so I probably pull an order from
zulily again because you know we're so
much in the instant gratification world
that I want my order like next week and
that's still a long time to me but I
absolutely love my tank I've been
wearing it so much wearing it proudly so
yeah love that and I just have one more
like kind of random a favorite to talk
about and that is actually just
instagram i'm as i'm recording this
video i'm putting together my one
and follower giveaway so if you don't
follow me yet on Instagram I am March

mostly just a bookish giveaway because
I'm going to run a separate giveaway

huge massive giveaway for that like

about that one but so I wanted the
Instagram one to be more book focused so
there have been so many fantastic
authors that are donating their books we

just going to be a lot out there and I

a lot of fun with it and the response

just have a few followers love to go
before i'll be doing that big giveaway
so be sure to follow and share if you
can because i'm super excited to bring
that give away to you being more into
like the beauty favorite side oh wait i
didn't mention another favorite my new
tattoo i got a new tattoo you guys can
see that i think i talked about it in my
den lancaster review video but for any
of those who maybe don't watch the book
videos of my chin
I did get a new tattoo last month it is
the Latin word for two right because
that has a very special meaning to me of
course being an author I really wanted
it on my finger and the thought process
was like you know obviously I use my
fingers to type my original thought was
like that's the finger that I used to
hold the pen that I write with type of
thing so yeah really loving on that then
getting into the favorites the first 1i
have is actually a lip liner from
Maybelline and it is wine so that is
what that looks like it is a pencil like
I all have to sharpen it eventually
which I don't particularly love but that
is the shade of it and I mean really
it's it's a wine color I mean the shade
describes it pretty well but I was
looking for I have world by Mac which is
more of like a pinky I don't know what I
want to describe like a pinky Brown type
of shade is well from Mac and then I
also have just like a pure red one from
Jordana but I didn't really have
anything like more on the pinkish sides
and I was actually going for something
more pink versus wine but this is really
all i could find the day I was at also
looking and so I just grabbed it but
actually I I think it still works really
well with my pinks I have on MIDI from
colour-pop today on my lips and it's
just like a really super light light
pink shade and I actually have this on
as the lip liner and I thought they
blend it really well together so it
actually has been working out pretty
well and I find myself using it more and
more with different lip shades I've used
it was solo from colour-pop I've used it
with melted strawberry from Too Faced
the melted lipstick and I think there
was another one I used it with oh and
I've used it with butter cup from Gerard
cosmetics so I'm using it quite a bit i
really like it and it course it's
maybelline subs very affordable another
one i have two more products from
Maybelline I love my billing you guys
Maybelline is probably my favorite no it
is is my favorite drugstore brand like I
have so many of their products
all different products like so i just
mentioned a lip liner and now i'm going
to talk about their Maybelline brow
drama it's their sculpting brow mascara
so it's for your eyebrows but this is
what the one looks like and I believe my
shade is blonde yep this is blonde so I
mean I'm just using this to like kind of
fill in my eyebrows and then it's kind
of just like a gel and it kind of keeps
them in place I honestly I have pretty
full eyebrows already like I get them
waxed on the regular to kind of take out
the fullness because I just have really
thick full eyebrows which I know a lot
of people like that's really in and some
people are drawing on their eyebrows to
do that that's not really the look that
I go for myself Persis personally so
I've like you know some like holes in
them and things like that and this
really helps kind of just spell them in
and then of course keep them in place I
don't really have a brow game I don't
have a brow is I don't have a brow
pencil or anything like that this is the
only thing that I have so far for my
eyebrows but it's working out for what I
need right now as I take maybe like baby
steps into getting more adventurous with
my eyebrows but as of right now I'm not
there yet but I just picked this up at
Target and i'm pretty sure it was only
like six dollars so maybe if you're a
newbie into the eyebrow game this could
be really good for you or if you really
don't need much for your eyebrows could
be a good option in the last product
that I have from Maybelline is the
maybelline superstay a better skin
foundation I did do a full review video
on this but I have just been using this
sucker like crazy can you tell it is so
dirty but like I can actually see that
the foundation is pretty far down there
but I think this is great I'm definitely
going to repurchase this because i think
this shade is like honestly two shades
too light for me especially right now I
guess you know we are getting into fall
and I'm going to be paler here coming
soon so maybe this shade I think I'd
still go at least one shade darker I
have 25 nude beige I'd probably still at
least go one shade darker even if I do
buy more towards the fall what I'm not
you know as tan as I usually a.m.
because I just thought it was a little
bit too light but I've been loving it
I've been reaching for it all the time
it's a lasting power is absolutely
incredible I did learn that it says it's
with this I don't know if I'm supposed
to read the letters or not but it's a CT
yl c act I'll see I don't know if that's
exactly how you say it but I did
research and look to see what that is
and basically it's supposed to be like
vitamin C but even better for your skin
so it does say that this is a skin
transforming foundation and that is why
they say that because it has you know
vitamin C is so great for your skin this
ingredient that they have in their
supposed to be even better than vitamin
C so it's supposed to help improve your
skin as you continually wear it so i
will definitely be repurchasing this in
a shade darker and I also do want to try
the better skin concealer that comes
with it because I've been hearing really
good things about the concealer to
Maybelline foundations are my favorite I
have the fit me I have the dewy I have
the fit me matte and poreless I have to
fit me concealer I have the Maybelline
primer like LM Evelyn and I have just
two more products to go the next one is
the Garnier Fructis textured tease and
it says it's a dry touch finishing spray
so i've been using this because i think
i mentioned it in a haul video and I
wasn't quite sure yet because i had not
used it so basically it's supposed to
give your hair texture so if you are
having like limp hair which my hair
today is like so super flat but if
you're having like flat or limp hair
you're supposed to be able to spray it
in and i'll help give you some volume I
honestly kind of think it's similar to a
dry shampoo as well because I kind of
getting the same result for when i use
my dry shampoo too when i use the
texture teeth so i've been using it as
both and my i just have a little guy of
dry shampoo from kendra and it's almost
out so the last two trips that I've
taken I've just thrown this in my bag
because I know it's going to give me
more volume even if I don't necessarily
need a dry shampoo but then if i do need
a dry shampoo I can use this as well and
it's kind of doing the same thing so
basically all I do is kind of like lift
my hair spray it in then I just kind of
like tees up the roots you know what I'm
saying and I'm doing this without a
mirror so I don't know exactly
I where I'm spraying lashes kind of what
you do and it's supposed to give you
more volume is that working do I look
like I have more volume in my hair who
knows kills I don't even know if I
spread this on my hair to tell you the
truth well I wouldn't say it smells like
fruity our floral or anything it kind of
smells like hairspray but I mean okay
I'm putting it in my hair and I think it
really works I got this at walgreens and
it's from Garnier's so I'm sure it's on
the Affordable side as well last one
that I have I don't think I shared this
in a haul video but i know that i did
put it on my snapchat if you guys don't
follow me on snapchat i can leave the
name up here but it will also be below
i'm just sitting at the dap march
whenever I do like small halls you know
I tend to pretty much only film my halls
if I have like a big alcohol or big
Sephora haul or big amazon big walgreens
hall whatever you know i can put
everything together and do it but
sometimes i just run to target get like
two things and then i start using them
and i forget and I don't hollom so I
share everything on snapchat that i buy
so if you don't follow me on snapchat
you should because i'll show you
everything that I get like I still have
my color pop video planned to film next
week but I shared everything on the
snapchat I shared swatches and all that
good stuff oh I can barely breathe last
one to share is this ultra light
cleansing oil and this is from
Neutrogena so this is what it looks like
it's just this little blue bottle it
says it ever so I for simply
effortlessly and completely removes dirt
oil and waterproof makeup and rinses
clean without stripping so you know
basically it's just an oil that you put
on your face what I do is after I wash
off my makeup I usually wash off my eye
makeup separate with an eye makeup
remover pad I use the ones from all my
really love those and then I'll take off
my makeup like normally I'm using an
exfoliator a cleanser mask I mean
whatever it is that I'm doing but then
what I'm done I'm now going in and using
this so you'd put it in your dry hand
and then you just put it all over your
face I put it on my neck as well I wait
a few minutes and then I wash it off
with water pop my face dry and put my
moisturizer on I feel like it is just
really helping me make sure I
get on my makeup off I have been wearing
more makeup now because I film YouTube
videos probably three or four times a
week so the days that I film you know
I'm wearing full foundation and I'm
wearing blush and wearing concealer in a
winning highlighter so I'm wearing more
makeup on my face those are the nights
that I use it if I go a day where I
don't wear any makeup at all I'll just
wash my face like normal at night and I
don't feel the need to use this I've
just I've been really feeling like I
needed an extra boost to make sure i'm
getting all my makeup off so i'm not
clogging my pores and I'm not having
breakouts so that's why i got it i think
it was like seven or eight dollars at
target so it's from Neutrogena so it's
definitely affordable this is a cute
little pump bottle I really like it it's
not very convenient to travel with but i
honestly think what i'm going to do is
buy one of those little travel
containers that you can buy at target
and just dump some of it in there
because things with the pump they just
make me nervous with travel whether you
have to put it in like a plastic bag
just so I know what that's not going to
pump out and get all over my clothes and
shoes and stuff but I honestly think I'm
going to buy one of those little
containers to put this into because I
think it's really really helping getting
all of my makeup on everything from my
August beauty and lifestyle favorites I
hope you guys enjoyed the product so

mentioned will be in the description box
