today's video is going to be my Ipsy bag
unbagging for August I'm super excited
to this video because I haven't had it
it's bag in a while and if she was so
nice to send me this bag so I'm really
excited to unbox this with you guys
would like to see everything that came
in my August itse bag when we go ahead
and get started so the Ipsy bags always
come in like these fun it shiny bags so
you know when your empty bag is coming
and then the bag for August this is what
mine looks like
so it says wild and free on there so
it's kind of like this ombre pink purple
bag I did open this up earlier and tried
everything on my face so I will be
inserting clips of me actually trying
everything on but to run through what I
got in my bag first I was really excited
to see this because I love first aid
beauty and I own so much from them this
is their skin rescue deep cleanser with
red clay it says to remove excess oils
on clogged pores and purify so this is
now a little daily cleanser it says you
can use it up to twice a day which is
another factor of being safe for
sensitive skin it has a very like minty
type of scent to it but when I wash it
off my face was not red or irritated at
all it just seems like a really nice
gentle yet deep cleanser at the same
time next up I thought this was really
interesting it came in this acute a
little bag like this they have a gold
heart of gold elixir so the packaging is
super super cool on it and is a rose
gold elixir I've been really into these
kind of elixirs lately I have another
rose gold one so I was just really
curious to give this one a try so I put
this on before my foundation and it says
that it has a vitamin C in it it's good
for brightening the skin it's good for
anti wrinkles and vitamin C is like it's
one thing in my skincare that I always
have to have so I thought it was really
cool that it was in this rose gold
elixir so next up I got a foundation
which really excited me because I love
foundation and I am on such a foundation
kick right now trying out so many
different ones this is from josie maran
into the vibrancy argon oil foundation
fluid this is what the outer packaging
looks like and I really haven't tried a
ton from josie maran and i've certainly
not tried a foundation so I was so so
excited so the packaging is super super
cute it says it's an argan oil
foundation fluid I did like the
foundation but I did notice it was a
couple shades too light for me so that
was kind of a bummer but I think I'm
just like really pan right now so a lot
of my foundations are not working for me
so I think once my summer of hands
starts to fade it wasn't like white or
too light on me I think this will be a
good winter foundation I thought it
looked kind of a dewy finish to the face
but it was super easy to blend out it
looks really nice on the skin so I'm
excited to keep giving this a try so
next up we had a brow pencil and I was
super curious about this because a lot
of you might know I'm not super great F
throat but this was from Paulo Dorf and
it was the universal brow pencil and it
since the shade is in taupe so I was
pretty intimidated when I saw this
because Universal brow pencil I'm like
how does the brow pencil work for
everybody the first thing that I noticed
was that it was kind of dark on my brows
I tried to go in as super light handed
as I possibly could because it was
looking pretty dark but once I started
to spoolie it out it was looking a lot
better but I definitely had to go and
just very very light handed it also had
a pretty waxy feel to it that I don't
think I've noticed in any other brow
pencils that I've used maybe a little
bit with the goof proof but this was
definitely like the waxy Espenson
that I have ever used but once I started
to get the hang of it I felt like it
kind of came out okay like I said I'm
not great at doing brows I think I did a
good enough job today but I will
definitely have to keep trying
this one from Apollodorus the universal
brows and so I thought this is from
winkie luxe it is there a peeper perfect
and I'm not gonna lie when I first
looked at it I thought it was a eyelid
primer and then when I actually squeezed
it onto my brush I was like don't really
look like an eyelid primer is actually a
concealer she actually did use a little
bit underneath my eyes and then I did
put it on my eyelids a lot of times I
use my concealer as an eyelid primer
anyway so that is what I did with this
and I thought it looked really well I do
think you need to set it pretty good
because I just used a pretty light hand
to set the concealer and I noticed a
little bit of creasing so I think those
would be better off for days where I'm
going to maybe bake and to get rid of
some of the creasing but other than that
I thought it was pretty good for the
first try that is everything that came
in my August FC bag a huge thank you
system for sending me this bag that was
so exciting I guess that I haven't got
an empty bag in a while so this was
really cool to be able to try out and to
try out some products that I haven't
tried before I was actually really
excited with everything that was in my
bag I thought that was really cool and
most everything worked out for me I just
have to play around with that brow
pencil a little bit more but other than
that I thought I had a really good bag

deluxe sample size products and it's $10
