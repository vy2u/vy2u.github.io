so today's video I'm like I'm super
excited to share this video and it is
going to be all about my nails now if
you are familiar with my channel you
know that I am a big fan of like
painting my own nails I'm also big fan
of press-on nails I don't typically go
to the salon to get my nails done I do
not do our critics they just like
destroy my nails shellac hurts my nails
so I can't do it very often so a big fan
of at home manicures and I have finally
finally found a company that is I feel
like going to be like my ride or die so
this video is going to be all about my
favorite fake nails the company that I'm
starting to go for there's a sale
announcement that I want to share with
you guys but I just wanted to give you
guys a breakdown of my favorite nails
and all that good stuff so if you would
like to see more about my claws ok so to
hop into it like i mentioned i'm always
painting my nails I'm like a really huge
huge fan of the sally hansen miracle gel
polish i have like five or six the
polishes that keep buying more i think
they work really well my downfall with
painting my own nails is that i'm not
very skilled at it my left hand is like
useless I I struggle so hard with this
hand I can paint my nails like okay but
I can never do any fun designs with them
if I want any designs I have to like ask
a friend to help me and I kind of feel
like a loser the other option that I've
been doing recently is buying like
press-on nails from the drugstore I've
shared a couple in halls have talked
about him on snapchat and I've been
wanting to like up my nail game because
now i'm here on youtube i'm showing
products up here on the camera I'm
taking product pictures with my hands on
Instagram like I just want nicer looking
nails and so I started buying the
press-on nails from the drugstore and
they worked but only for like two days
it would be something where I would put
the nails on before I was going to like
do a video or take a bunch of pictures
and then I would have to take them off
pretty quickly because they just like
didn't stick well or they didn't look
good they weren't fitted to my nail
they felt like they were going to pop
off kind of getting a little discouraged
but then I found the company nail her so
this is what this video is all about is
the company nail her and actually how I
found them was youtuber Nicole Guerrero
did a collaboration with them so she
came out with like her own set of fake
nails and I watched her video and I went
to the website and I was like that seems
pretty cool but do they really work and
so it was like once every month I would
go back and look at the website and be
like should I order from them or not I
don't know i'll keep waiting I kept
buying the press ons and it was just a
few weeks ago I had the press-on nails
on and one came off while we were at a
restaurant and eating and I wasn't very
happy about it and I don't know I just
realized that I just didn't think that
they looked good and I was like I need
another plan I actually really
considered going out and starting to get
acrylics even though I didn't want to do
it I didn't want to take the expense of
it I didn't want to do that to my
fingernails and then I was like wait a
second that nail her company I'm really
going to try it out I ordered one pair
because I just wanted one pair I just
wanted to see how it worked and then I
also applied to be an affiliate with
them and still the first pair that i
ordered i bought by myself these were
not sent to me this video is not
sponsored by nail her I'm just coming on
here and telling you guys that I found a
brand that I truly love so I ordered
pair applied to be an affiliate I got my
pair in the mail I got accepted to be an
affiliate which just means that i have a
coupon code that i can offer you guys to
get a percentage off your orders and I
do make a small commission off that code
by small i mean like probably like under
a dollar I haven't done the math but I'm
sure it's not very large so I was
excited about it especially especially
when I put the nails on and I didn't say
anything to anyone about being affiliate
until I actually put the nails on and
try them out and saw that I loved him
because if I didn't love them I wasn't
going to tell you guys about it and I
I'm going to be like hey behind these
and use my code even though i don't like
them and I'm never going to wear them
again like that's not what I'm going to
do it really does have to be about
honesty I was a huge YouTube watcher
before I even started getting on YouTube
and I take what other people say very
very seriously and if people are
recommending things to me I need to be
able to trust them so I want people to
feel that same way about me but even
before I got on YouTube my job has been
a product reviewer for the past seven
years I review books but I review beauty
products I review hair care I review
fitness like I have been a reviewer for
seven years and I take being able to
honestly review products very very
seriously so i just wanted to point that
out as well but to jump into the nails
finally I feel like there's others like
so many she feels we gotta get out of
the way so the company is called nailed
her and they have a great website I'll
leave everything linked below but their
website was very easy to navigate and
when I was picking out the nails it's
very cool because they have four
different like shapes of nails that you
can get there's oval stiletto square and
squalid oh I don't know if I'm saying
that right and basically I think that
one is like it like between a square and
a stiletto my nails are square just like
a regular ol square the Stiletto or more
of the pointed nails and what else was
there oval shaped in an oval so they
have four different styles that you can
pick from and then within their they
have so many different designs they have
plain they have fun they have
contemporary they have blingy they have
out there they have glitter they have
Sparkle they have rhinestones I mean
they have so many different options
options to choose from and i was like
huh what nails am I going to order but
the ones i went with i decided to go
with square first for the shape because
i figured square would be the easiest
for me so i went with square and then
the ones that i got were a cosmopolitan
chic so they are white nails and they
have like little gold designs on a few
of them i can also insert
pictures here as well because I've been
sharing pictures of my nails but this is
what it looks like when I got my order
in the mail so it comes in this box each
package comes with 24 nails there's 12
different sizes it also comes with a
nail file and nail glue so that is
everything that is included in here so i
got them and the first thing that I did
before putting them on was I went
through and shaped each one of them to
my nails this is so important to do you
don't want to be in the process of
putting nails on and then realizing like
you can't find a certain size or you're
trying to like dig through the box like
go through each one and size them make
sure everything is good for your nails
if you need to sometimes I need to file
down the edges of my nails especially
when I was buying from like the
drugstore I would need to file those
down when I put these on I did not file
them down at all on the sides and I
thought they looked just fine so that
was like the first thing that like kind
of surprised me i was like i don't need
to file these but who knows maybe other
pairs will be different that's the first
thing i did was went through incised
everything then you want to make sure
your nails don't have any nail polish on
them you don't have any like oils
moisturizers lotions anything like that
on your hands but just to be on the safe
side and make sure that your nails are
going to be like grippy for the nail
glue is I go through and file on my
nails like buff my nails and the file
that is included in here is actually
really really good sometimes I use files
that are included in with nail kits and
they're just not doing anything and I
always have a nail file at my desk and I
would have to use that but their nail
file actually like really really did the
job so they say when applying the nail
her nails is if you want it to last if
you want your nails to stay on for a
very long time you're supposed to apply
it thin layer of glue to the fake nail
and then also a thin layer of glue glue
to your actual nail if you don't want
the nails to stay on as long only apply
to like the nail so you're just not
using as much glue so I applied them to
both I applied it to the nail and to the
nail myself and then it's very easy to
me to just pop them on I have had my
nails on since saturday morning about
nine o'clock or so I put the nails on it
is now wednesday at one-thirty and these
suckers have not moved and I am like
super super impressed with that I type
like a freaking mad woman like I type
like crazy and all I do is type all day
I'm constantly on my computer if you
don't know I am an author I'm in the
process of finishing up my fifth book
and so I'm typing like when I get lost
on the scene it's like my fingers can
start to hurt because i'm typing so hard
i have showered i have washed the dishes
i have done things like our patio door
has a lock that you have to like flip up
and I legit have flipped it up one time
and popped off a fake nail none of my
nails have fallen off I wash my hands
constantly like they have not gone
anywhere and that what that is what has
impressed me so much but also because
they don't feel loose at any point like
I don't feel like I have to do anything
different with my hands are with my
nails as like like I'm protecting them I
don't feel like I need to protect my
nails at all and they're just still here
it's very incredible I'm so so so beyond
pleased with that I don't know what they
put on their nail glue but I am all
about it now another very cool thing
about nailed her is that they say that
these nails are reusable that you can
use them up to 20 times this is my first
set the first time I'm putting them on
so i can't speak to that yet but i'm
sure i can in the future but also that
you can paint over the nails now they do
say that you can only paint over nails
that do not have like 3d designs or
raised glitter things like that but you
can paint over them and then just take
them off with nail polish remover and
the initial design on there will still
be there I think that is very cool so
like I said I'm filming this on
Wednesday tomorrow is actually st.
Patty's Day what I am planning to do
tonight is I'm going to take them off
myself I've been looking around at a lot
of different nail her videos and
Instagram post blog posts and most
people last around five to seven days
and so today is my day 5 and what I want
to do is take them off and then reapply
them with glue so essentially get like
another five days out of it but I also
want to repaint them green I think I'm
going to leave my ring nail alone it's
like an accent nail but I'm going to
paint the other nails green and then try
to take the polish off and see how that
works I'll let you guys know if you
don't follow me on snapchat I definitely
recommend follow me there because I've
been giving so many nail updates because
so many of you are asking like how did
it work how they go on how many days
have you had it on like there's been a
lot of questions about these nails which
is why i'm doing this video i wasn't
really planning to but then I loved him
so much and between getting the
questions I was like let's just do it I
would say definitely follow me over
there I'm just Samantha DAP March but
I'm giving updates like every morning
I'm like day three day four day five
like it's so funny but I will definitely
share the process of painting them with
you removing the nails putting the nails
back on for a second time you know that
sort of thing I'll let you guys know how
all of that goes on my snapchat also I
wanted to say if you guys want to see a
video of me actually putting the nails
on like opening a new box filing my
nails putting the glue on putting the
nails on let me know because I will
figure out a way to film that for you if
you guys do want to see it I didn't
really want to do it with this set
because this is the only set i have
because like i said i only ordered one
to make sure i like them i now have
three other styles in my cart right now
yeah so i figured if you guys want to
see that with one of the new sets that i
get in i can do it for the first time so
that way I'm not reapplying like second
time nails just in case things don't
work out it doesn't look as good it's
harder to apply whatever the case may be
but I can do that so if you guys would
want to see that please just leave that
in the comments below but so far i just
i truly can't believe how impressed I am
with these I can't believe how long they
stay on and just how natural they feel
like they just feel like they're a part
of my nails one thing that I would
really notice what the other like
drugstore press-on nails was that there
was always a very large gap between the
fake nail and my actual nail so like if
I went like this I could see
there's a gap in between my nails and
also like they just did not fit well you
could always see my nails like on one of
the sides and it just didn't look great
I guess just didn't look great like it
was passable but not really like if I
wanted to go on public a lot of times I
find myself taking the nails off which
is silly because that's why you want
nails is because you want to like show
them off and be like hey look I have a
pretty manicure too hey these I don't
see that at all like the fit is just is
just so well like I said you can file
them on the sides if you need to I
didn't need to and they just cover
everything when I look at them like this
there's no gaps in my nails like I'm
blown away I'm so impressed I'm so so
happy with them I'm ordering more um I
have three in my cart right now and I'm
pretty excited about all three of them
but yes I will definitely be ordering
more but I just wanted to share this
video with you guys to let you guys know
if you are like me and you're looking
for a good alternative to like a salon
manicure I feel like this is a good one
been looking so long for good press on
nails I'm so happy that I found them I'm
also excited like I feel like one thing
that I'm super excited for and I'm just
like crossing my fingers that this works
is that if you are able to paint over
them and then safely remove the polish
because I have a lot of nail polish
especially lately I've been building up
my nail polish collection and I'm like I
don't want to lose that cute like colors
that I have but now if I can paint over
them and then still that will be so so
cool so my fingers are so so crossed
that that will work out so we'll see
i'll update you guys on my snapchat how
that all works out in a future video if
you guys do want to see them but yeah so
just want to pop on here nail her nail
you have some sale information and I can
get into like my affiliate discount code
and all that stuff so if you are
interested in that maybe want to pick up
some of your own nails please keep
watching it everything will be linked in
the description box below I'll have a
link to the nail her website i'll have
my discount code down there and the sale
information i just saw the sale
information this morning and i was super
happy that I found
because I actually tried to film this
video yesterday and it rained the whole
day and it was still cloudy and I just
film with natural light so i could not
film that video and I was super bummed
about it it actually was supposed to
rain and be cloudy all day today and
it's been nothing but sunshine like what
a he'll be but then I kind of like I was
like oh that did work out because if I
would have filmed that yesterday I
wouldn't have solved the sale news and
now there's sale going on hello so if
you would like to use my discount code
it is just samantha march i can put it
here it will be linked in the
description box below and you get ten
percent off your order so if you want to
try out a set and you want to save just
a little bit of money to be able to test
out this especially if it's going to be
like your first time trying nail her or
trying fake nails press-on nails in
general get ten percent off if you don't
want to use my code because it is an
affiliate code don't use my coat that's
totally fine there's no hard feelings I
know some people are like weirded out
about affiliate codes that's like all I
use when I check out is affiliate code
like morphe Sigma anything that I can
find that has an affiliate code i'm
using it so you can get three sets of
nails for thirty dollars by using the
code lucky three or you can also get
five sets of nails for fifty dollars and
use the code lucky five so the prices
generally for each set is 1399 that's
the standard price that i'm seeing for
each set of nails each set does come
wife like I mentioned in the beginning
the 24 nails the nail file and the nail
glue I had to double check to make sure
the nail glue came with each set or if
you had to write separately because you
can buy nail glue separately on the
website so when I was ordering I was
like wait do I need to order nail glue
separate but note each pack does come
with the nail glue in there normally yes
it's 1399 so you can get 3 4 30 or five
450 by using those codes again they are
right on the website which is what I'm
looking at where I'll leave them in the
description box below see you just
looking at the website I don't see like
an end date but I will try to find that
out for you so I can put that in the
description box
you so you guys know when that sale is
ending but also very cool they do have
like their own subscription service I
believe it's like nine dollars and
ninety three cents it's under ten
dollars but it sounds like kind of weird
price like that I think it was like 993
and you can get a new set of nails
delivered to your door every month which
if you end up just completely loving
nail her or you're just such a huge nail
fan in general I think that's a very
very cool idea so I didn't want to save
that as well that I'm curious about
myself is how many applications of nails
that I can do with one tube of nail glue
and my only fear is that when I take
these off and paint him and put it back
on I'm afraid I'm going to run out of
nail glue because i want the nail cystic
I'm longer so I'm putting the glue on
the nails and on my nail I'm like home
and I hope I don't run out of glue like
did one hand and then I run out of glue
for the other hand that's the only thing
that I'm kind of curious about so i can
update you guys with that too I I looked
around to see if i could find anything
that said like you can get 10 or 20 uses
or 30 uses out of the nail glue but I
didn't find anything so I'll have to
test that out for myself and see because
I feel like I would definitely be
ordering more nail glue just separately
from their website because whatever
whatever is in this is friggin amazing
and I'm impressed but yeah so that's a
little bit about the pricing the sale my
discount code how the nails work what
they come with I hope I touched on
everything if you guys have any other
questions for me anything that I didn't
answer because I'm sure that I forgot
something I don't ever plan out my
videos I just sit down and like start
talking and see what happens and I
usually don't go forgetting something
but if you have any questions comments
anything like that please just leave
them in the comments below I'm happy to
answer them like I said if you don't
follow me on snapchat you can follow me
there because I talk about them all the
time like every single day that I've had
them on i'm sure i'll talk about the
process of removing them painting them
putting them back on taking off the nail
polish i'll let you guys know which
nails i'm going to order next to think
well i think i might do the 5 for 50 now
like i might as well do 5 for 50 right
side 3
card anyways and I was like whoa whoa
that's pretty good but if it's 5 for 50
my birthday is coming up you know happy
birthday to me about man attempted to
you know that I'm on a no buy and sell
my birthday the struggle has been real
struggle has been real so I think that's
all i hope you guys enjoyed this video i
hope you liked learning about my nails I
was just so super impressed with the
overall nails I'm impressed with the
website on my press with the prices I'm
impressed with how fast it came to me it
only took like two days or something to
get shipped to me it was maybe it was
three but it was super fast shipping so
I was very impressed by that I'm just
I'm really happy to be working with such
a great company that I've ended up
