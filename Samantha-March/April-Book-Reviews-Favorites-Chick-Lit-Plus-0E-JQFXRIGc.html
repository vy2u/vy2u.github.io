channel so today's video is going to be
a book video it is going to be the book
reveals and the book favorites from my
blog chicklet plus for the month of
april so usually i do a book review
video and then a book favorites video i
usually separate them but we only have I
think for book favorites for April so
that probably wouldn't be a very long
video so I'm going to combine the tools
we have a little bit more content for
this video so it's going to be all of
the reviews from me for books that i
read personally for chiclet plus in
april and then also the book favorites
on chocolate plus and that can be from
me and any of my reviewers on my review
team for chocolate plus so if you are
new to my channel or not familiar with
my bookish aside my channel is now
mainly focused on beauty because those
were the most popular videos these were
the ones that were constantly being
requested but i do want to still share a
few book videos along the way because
that is my career I am a folsom author I
do run a blog called chocolate plus we
feed your book reviews and other author
features over there I also do a lot of
freelance work for books such as editing
proofreading marketing that sort of
thing so I'd like to be able to keep
some of my book videos in here as well
if they start getting requested more
again that I'm happy to do those but I
was just finding that the beauty side
was being much more highly requested so
I want to make sure i'm putting out
content that everyone wants to see
without getting away from who i actually
am so wanted to let you guys know that
but if you would like to see some of the
reviews and book favorites from
chocolate plus in the month of April
Comiskey the first book that I reviewed
in April is keep me posted this is by
Lisa Beasley i will insert the covers
over here for each title like i normally
do from amazon it says two sisters share
the surprising highs and cringe-worthy
lows of social media fame when their
most private thoughts become incredibly
public in this brush and funny debut
novel with Barlow sisters Cassie and Sid
and when I read the synopsis I just I
thought this would be a book that would
be for me as someone who is in social
media like I consider social media a
part of my job it is something that I
have to do in order to get word out
there about my books it is something I
have to do to make sure my blog stays
relevant my Instagram pistes relevant my
youtube stays relevant etc like I just
have to be on social media and of course
social media is great but there are also
so many downfalls to it so I was very
curious about this one and we have two
very different sisters Sid actually
lives overseas and it's someone who she
was kind of is like a hippie type she
doesn't believe in social media she
doesn't have social media her sister
Cassie lives in the u.s. she's someone
who's like addicted to Facebook she just
she loves social media she's always on
it and the sisters decide because
there's so much distance between them
they decided to start penning each of
their actual letters and sending them to
each other and they're doing that and as
the writing these letters you know
they're going in-depth about issues from
their past or issues from their present
and just really talking to one another
and being honest with one another and
Cassie for whatever reason decides that
she wants to keep all of these letters
and she scans the letters and she
uploads them to a blog she keeps a blog
private there's a bug a crash a virus
something happens all of a sudden the
blog is now public and people find this
blog and are reading the letters back
and forth from the sisters and like
mayhem ensues now I get the concept of
it I do and I and I find that
interesting because they were people who
didn't want social media Fame they
didn't want social media attention it
just kind of happened to him by accident
but I just really struggled with
understanding what the big deal was I
guess there is the only part that I like
was like okay I feel like I get this was
once the server was dealing with some
infidelity issues on her part and I
understand having that be exposed oh
really you know your private thoughts I
get it you like you don't want them
exposed but in the book it didn't seem
like it
that big of a deal it I don't know I
just was confused at to like why the
world was falling apart and the once sir
flies to see the other and I just I just
kind of didn't get it I think get it I
wasn't connecting with it I don't know
you know maybe it's my age maybe it's my
job I don't know but I just I struggled
to see the huge issue and it just kind
of fell flat for me so I only give this
one a 3 star review just because I I
just struggled so hard to connect with
it and also just to connect with the
characters I did not feel much of a
connection with either sister and I
don't know just kind of turned out to be
not for me what's really bummed me out
because I thought this one would be like
a if not a favorite very high up there
on my list but only in three stars for
keep me posted by Lisa Beasley the next
one I have is the big interview this is
by libby Kirsch I also read the big lead
by libby Kirsch which is the first book
in the Stella Reynolds series and I
loved the big lead I gave it five stars
I was so excited for the big interview
to come out I felt so grateful when Lee
beakers reached out to me and asked if
she could send me a review copy because
this was a book that I definitely did
want to read I'm just like with the big
lead I thought the big interview was
fast pace is a very enjoyable mystery it
was a lot of like twists and turns
definitely not a mystery that i felt
like i had solved in the beginning I
knew there was you know gonna be more to
the story and who was actually behind
all of the murders and everything that
was going on with Stella Reynolds I
didn't find myself that I enjoyed it as
much as the big lead and honestly that's
pretty common with series usually the
first book is just like loved it loved
it loved it and a lot of times the
second book the third book etc it can
just be like oh but just didn't quite
measure up to the first book like that's
very common at least for me so well i
did still truly enjoy this one and had a
great time reading it i get i did give
it a four star review but this is
definitely a mystery series that i say
to check out Stella Reynolds series from
Libby Kirsch so the next one I have is
also the first book favorite this is a
review for me it is
from always the bridesmaid by old and
Zeke elk and I was very grateful Lindsay
actually sent me a print copy of this
book and she also sent me a really cool
tote bag that has to deal with the book
as well and I just was very grateful to
not only get a book but at Oh big as
well because I can never have enough of
those four wheel but i really enjoy
Lindsay's books I have read so many from
her she's a fantastic chiclet author
always the bride maids I have to say is
hysterical I laughed so much I left
unexpectedly i snored it with laughter I
remember like one night the night i
snored it with laughter my husband was
like seriously and I was like I'm sorry
that was just that was really funny so
many good humorous moments in here and I
really enjoyed it i'm actually I'm
looking at my review right now and my
very first line is all right the first
thing I need to say about this book is
that it's funny funny so I thought it
was a very funny book so if you like
humor if you like Chiclets this is a
really really good one I definitely
suggest checking out Lindsey calc she is
such a strong writer if you are a
chocolate fan definitely a writer for
you to check out if you have nuts and i
gave always the brides and now you don't
have is even Thea's gif and this is by
Fe kamon al not totally sure how to
pronounce that name but this one I said
in my review that I wasn't quite sure
what to expect with this book and it was
a little bit different from what I would
normally read very interested in it
though because of all the talk about
Greece and graces like have it has been
at the top of my list of places to visit
for years and years I don't even know
how many years it has always been at the
top of my list so I thought it would be
a lot of fun to read I did enjoy the
writing the writing is very very strong
in this novel there's a great love story
going on that goes across like decades
of time I thought was very interesting
but I love the scenery the settings the
bits of like culture that we get
throughout the book I really enjoyed
those moments so while timmy was a
little bit of a slower read I mean it
wasn't like literary fiction I wouldn't
call it literary but it was more leaning
on the contemporary
reyna literary side so if you enjoy that
I would definitely suggest a pantheist
gift to you but I did end up very much
appreciating the story again I was very
impressed with the writing in here and I
gave evanthia skiff four stars next one
I have is a another five star from me
this is for sister dear by Laura McNeil
I love Laura McNeil as a domestic
suspense writer I have also read and
reviewed center of gravity I know it
ended up in a favorites video on this
channel because I just thought it was so
fantastic I was waiting so eerily for
sister dear to come out and I felt very
honored that Laura contacted me and
asked if she could send me a review copy
so excited because I was just waiting to
read this book from amazon it says all a
lee marshall wants as a fresh start but
when dark secrets refused to stay buried
well her chance at a new life be
shattered forever so I'm not gonna let
the only thing that kind of like threw
me off was that I didn't feel like the
blurb really drew me in and to be honest
I didn't feel like I really knew what
the story was going to be about from the
blur for some reason I I don't know I
wasn't like putting the pieces together
and that actually made me a little bit
nervous before I started to read the
book and I read the blur but I was like
okay but I mean fear gun because this
book was incredible I gave a 5 stars I
absolutely loved it basically we follow
ally who is in jail for murder and we
can tell you know we know from the book
that she did not commit the murder um
but she was it looked to be like she was
framed or there was a lot of pressure to
find the killer right away it was the
football coach that got killed the story
is set in the south which for some
reason like I just love southern fiction
I don't know what it is but you know in
the South people take their football
very seriously of my family's in Alabama
roll tide so that's actually where this
book is set as well as Alabama um so she
you know her case is very fast very
quick she gets put into jail she has a
young daughter that she has to leave
behind she has a great life she was a
medical student she was going to be a
doctor she was about to be engaged you
know she had a great man waiting for her
she had this little
water and everything is taken away from
her when she is committed when she is
convicted of this murder and as we go
along there are several different point
of views in this book which I thought
was very interesting we get Ally's point
of view we get her sisters point of view
which obviously the sister has some sort
of role in all of this if you can't tell
based on the title sister dear we get
the shares point of view we're going
back and forth between the past and
present and it was insane to read I mean
obviously I'm not going to like so if
you're in like tell you guys everything
because I really want you to read this
one it for yourselves and I don't want
to give too much away because as you
slowly start to peel back the layers and
get into more of the mystery it's just
like jaw-dropping I'm sorry if you guys
can hear my dog she's right across from
me and she was snoring so loud so loud
whoa but it just it was fantastic it was
suspenseful it was it was eerie i mean
that's like that's a word that I feel
like would readily describe this book it
was eerie the situations that happen the
situations that were let happen and then
the whole murder the crime the situation
it was just eerie but it was so good to
read about if you are a fan of suspense
I highly highly highly recommend it
Laura McNeil to you center of gravity I
gave five stars and sister dear get it
got a big ol five star review from me
and i have is will you won't you want me
by nora Selawik Bellavance key and i'm
sure if i'm saying that right either and
i always feel like when i say this title
that i'm like tripping it up this is
another one that i thought maybe i would
really get along with and that I kind of
didn't basically we're following
Marjorie plum who says she was never
meant to peak in high school she was
Queen B now ten years later she's lost
her Sparkle was the last night I thought
it was a good one it says it's a funny
often surprising novel about growing up
when you are already supposed to be
grown I really like the synopsis it
sounded pretty interesting to me but
unfortunately I mean from the
getting I just struggled so hard to get
into this book I did not connect with
Marjorie at all I kind of found her to
be shallow not very likeable I tried I I
tried so hard so many times but I just
could not find like it was just one of
those books where I just wasn't excited
to pick it up again I was mostly picking
up the book and reading because i knew i
had a rape you do for it but I wasn't
very excited about it the first half of
the book especially especially leg for
me which is so hard when it's the
beginning of the book because then you
don't want to read it I'm not someone
who does not finish reading novels
because you just never know what's going
to happen and for this one I'm glad
because the end did kind of turnaround
which is why I gave it three stars vs
two stars the ending I did enjoy I
honestly kind of felt too like we didn't
even need the first half of the book I
was kind of like I don't know if I truly
gained anything out of that because by
the time i read the end of the book i
was like that was really good and I felt
like something different could have
happened to make the book as a whole
better but again it's just my opinion
you know everyone's going to have
different opinions especially when it
comes to books of course but for me it
just it just kind of fell flat
throughout I'm glad that I waited till
the end and I and I kept reading because
I did enjoy the ending I thought it was
a lot of fun to read I thought it was
interesting there's a lot of twists and
plot twists happening at the end of the
book that I enjoyed reading about I just
wished the beginning would have started
off as strong so that is a three star
review for will you launches one is
another five star review this is from my
reviewer Andrea the book is to learn a
proper lady by Ashlyn McNamara I just by
looking at the cover it appears to be a
historical fiction review says I cannot
praise this book highly enough if you
love historical romances you must read
this novel the love story is bound
tightly and expertly throughout the
perplexity of the Dukes mysterious
illness there are just enough
tantalizing scenes to break up the maze
of this Victorian clue everyone's a
suspect in this whodunit so again as a
five star review from Andrea for how to
lure a proper lady by ashlynn McNamara
another review from me is far at love
Alabama this is by Susan sands I
absolutely
love the cover of this novel I also saw
the words southern in the synopsis and
beauty queen and I was like I'll read
this one because again I don't know what
it is about southern fiction I just I
love it so much I don't know if that
means I should move to the south or what
but I just enjoy reading southern novels
I really did enjoy this one this is a
the second book in a series the first
book is called again Alabama I have not
read that book not hinder me from
reading love Alabama I could just tell
as i was reading that you know there is
a first book there is the larue sisters
that we follow and this book we follow
Amazo in this book it's interesting
because there's a lot of serious
discussions in this novel and a lot that
makes you think and a lot that makes you
cringe all that that makes you angry but
at the same time it never felt like a
heavy read it read very much like a
chick-lit novel except there was just a
lot of those series but it's thrown in
there but I really enjoyed it again like
I said it is a part of a series i would
like to read again Alabama just because
I really enjoyed getting to know the
larue sisters and the family and sounds
like there's a bit of mystery in the
first book as well I also hope that
there will be more from this series
because I would love to read them but
again I gave four stars to love Alabama
by Susan sands then the last five star
review that we have particular plasma
think we have two more reviews but one
other five star review is from Christy
and this is for when in rome by jay lin
Rowan the Christie's review says a quick
read wonderful story and outstanding
writing makes one in Rome one of my
favorite books of the year so that is
huge praise huge huge phrase from our
reviewer Christie for when in rome by
jail in Rowan definitely a book sounds
like to check out for all of the books
that I have mentioned i will leave their
links to amazon below if you are
interested in purchasing the book and i
will also leave the review links to
chocolate plus so if you would like to
read the full review on there on
chocolate plus all of that will be
linked in the description box another
review i have is for lemon twist by
charice olson the synopsis really pulled
me in the very first line and there is
how bad would it be if we don't get
married and so the Audrey is
planning her perfect wedding for her
perfect life and perfect feature is dr.
Gregory Smith's wife right up until he
calls up the news his chili feet have
gone icy cold I thought that was very
interesting the beginning of this book
really had me like it really pulled me
in I enjoyed the writing there was a lot
of drama to it but I understood it
because you know Audrey her wedding is
being called off and now she has to tell
people her wedding is being called off
she's losing the man that she loved and
she's losing this life that she thought
she was going to have she was actually
going to pick up and and move to Alabama
leave her job leave you know her friends
behind to marry this man and he calls
her and breaks it off really gives no
good reason besides saying the you know
he's basically just a huge commitment
phobe like when he thinks about getting
married he wants to be sick like he
still wants to be with Audrey but he
just doesn't want to get married and
obviously I feel like it's really hard
to go back to a relationship once you've
been engaged and you have a wedding plan
and you break the wedding off but you
still stay together usually don't see
that working out but as the book
progressed unfortunately to me once I
got to about the halfway point it kind
of lost me and I guess I kind of got
frustrated with Audrey because it seemed
like the only thing that she was really
always centering around was men and like
needing approval from men or needing to
be with a man and I I kind of was
getting a little frustrated because
first it was her fiancé then it was a
boss at work and then even as we keep
reading and going farther there's still
men seem to be like the focal point for
her and that was a little bit
frustrating to me I did find it
intriguing when she decided to move to
Costa Rica to be a missionary it was a
little bit out of the blue for me but
there's also a lot of religion in this
book there's religiously quotes from the
Bible and stuff that happens frequently
throughout you know even though I'm not
someone who considers myself religious
it's not something that bothered me it
is something i want to point out because
i know some people can get bothered by
that sort of thing it didn't really
bother me it just was like who the main
character was but she does go on to
Costa Rica to be a missionary which like
I said it was a little bit out of the
blue for me not so much since her faith
appears to be a big part of who she is
and so it kind of
started to bring you back a little bit
once she got to Costa Rica she was
trying to learn language she was trying
to do her job there that kind of got a
little bit more interesting to me but
unfortunately just with the parts that
like so much and kind of left me a
little bit uninterested it was kind of
hard to pull me all the way back into
the story so I ended up giving it a 3.5
a star review and so that is for lemon
twist by charice Olson I do have one
more book that i will be reviewing in
april i'm actually finishing it right
now i'm about halfway through the book
but i did want to mention it is called
scar tissue by MC doma bitch and this
field is freaking Karimi it's like
giving me the chills while I'm reading
it it's more like a suspense type of
book but basically we're following
Sierra Kelly who gets kidnapped and like
tortured and it's biased like a serial
killer called the cutter because he's
cutting like words into his victims and
she gets away but she's left with these
horrible scars on her body and she's
constantly fleeing from these men who
are trying to get her and torture her
and I mean it's not they really don't go
into depth into those scenes because if
the writer did I probably would not be
able to really read this book because I
cannot stomach things like that and it's
more of just like the suspenseful parts
that we're getting but then we also get
like the little bit of back story that's
happening that is creeping me out like I
said I'm just about done with that I'm
actually reading it like like my kindle
is on next to me it's on I can see it I
can see the word because I'm always
multitasking and I'm always reading but
it is a very good book I'm pretty
positive i'm going to give it a force or
a review lest something like super crazy
habits at the end but again all of my
links to my reviews and amazon will be
in the description box below and that is
everything and that in everything for
this video i hope that you enjoy to some
of these book reviews and book favorites
from my blog chicklet plus for the month
of april so do have one announcement to
make that is bookish wise i do own a
publishing complete publishing company
is called marching inc and one of our
marching ink is called Perry and
progress by catleg wah it has recently
been formatted into audio as well and
the audio book has gone for sale on
audible com also on amazon as well i can
leave the links to perry in progress
below but if you are a fan of audiobooks
like me then that book is recently
available on audio and i'm so excited
because i love audio books I'm also very
excited because the same narrator that
we got for Perry in progress is
currently in the midst of recording up
to i do which is my fourth novel so that
will be available in audio very soon
also i actually just teamed up with
audible as an affiliate for them which
i'm very excited about because like i
mentioned i love audible i've been a
member for at least a year i think i
signed up with them last summer and i
absolutely enjoy them it's so easy to
get an audio book i love to listen to
audio books when i walk my dog so i'm
just getting back into my audiobook game
now that the weather is getting nicer
and i'm taking more walks of areas i
have gotten through to audio books so
far and just totally enjoy them audible
i think it's a very easy process to find
them and to get a membership but also as
an affiliate with them they did give me
a link i will leave that link in the
description box below but if you use
that link to join audible to if you are
a new member and you use that link to
sign up you can do a free trial with
them and you can get your first audio
book one audio book for free to listen
to so it can kind of be like your test
run if you decide audible it's not for
you you can cancel there's no anything
on your end now you have to do or pay
for if you decide that you do like
audible you get your one book for free
and then you can go on and choose a
membership option that works for you and
get audio books every month or whatever
it is option that you choose works best
for you but i'm really excited because I
mean obviously audible is something that
I use myself are you listening to
audiobooks every single day I personally
love the audio books but not only that
it's where my audio books are sold my
third novel of questionable friendship
is an audiobook it's for sale inaudible
I used their great program for authored
create to find
narrator and to create my audio books so
just a big fan of audible very excited
to be working with them this video is
not sponsored not sponsored by audible
or anything like that but they did give
me an affiliate link so if you do use
that link and you sign up and you get
your first audio book for free I do make
a small commission off that so just so
you know it is an affiliate link but
again it's not just something that I'm
saying to you guys it's something that
is used by me every single day so if you
want to try out audio books and you've
been kind of on the fence about it
because I was on the fence about it I
actually used someones referral link
when I signed up for audible to see if I
liked it because I was like I don't know
i don't know if i'm going to use them or
not like am I gonna like audio books I
was the same way when it came to ebooks
I did not go out and buy a kindle right
away cuz i was like what i don't
understand what that is about so i was i
was on the fence as well but if you do
want to try it out again that will be
listed below i think it's just audible
trial calm / smith march maybe I don't
know it'll be linked down below I'll
also leave the links to Perry and
progress as well as any other marching
Inc book that we have down there I'll
leave all those linked in the
description box for you in case you are
looking for some recommendations as well
