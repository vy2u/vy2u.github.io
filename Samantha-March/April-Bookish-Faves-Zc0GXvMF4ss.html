again I always clap at the beginning of
these videos can you tell I was a
cheerleader in high school so today I'm
going to do in April's favorites video
and this is going to be kind of new to
my channel because it's not book reviews
and it's not a mail haul and it's also
going to be kind of a new thing like I
don't do this on chicklet plus my
website so I'm kind of excited for that
to be able to bring something new just
to the YouTube channel going to do is
talk about the books that were reviewed
on chocolate plus in you know for this
month it'll be in the month of April and
that received five stars from either
myself or my team of reviewers and so I
kind of like this too because you know
the books that my reviewers have read
and reviewed obviously I can't really
talk about them on the channel because I
haven't read them so oh I'm excited to
be able to maybe have a few more books
that I can talk about with you guys
bring something new to the channel bring
something new to chiclet + + spotlight
the books that we really loved so if you
guys like this idea if you can like
video or comment and let me know so I
know if I'm like on the right track if
this is something that you guys want to
see I watch a lot of beauty youtube
videos as well and a lot of the girls at
the end of the month or be the beginning
of a new month they do what their
monthly favorites were and they go
through I mean the most to talk about
like makeup or skincare or hair products
but some do like clothes and choose or
like I've seen apps being talked about
but I thought maybe you'd be really cool
to do a bookish one for this channel so
again if you guys like the idea let me
know or you have any other ideas for
other segments that you guys maybe you
would want to see please just go ahead
and comment and tell me and i will pay
attention to that and I've lost my list
so hold on need go get my list in a back
okay got my list we're ready to go
so I have five books to talk about that
got five star reviews on chocolate plus
and April either from myself or from one
of my reviewers first one is first one
is called Tainted Love and it's by Aaron
colwood cat would think i'm saying that
right um so so that's Tainted Love and
the way that I met erin was she actually
asked me to proof read a book for her or
edited book for her I was I did
freelance editing for her and so then I
was like well you know maybe might be
helpful if I read some of your other
books and so I'm just putting that
disclaimer out there but my review and I
think I've said this before I'm very
honest in my reviews you know in the
bookish community I know so many people
you know it's impossible that just if I
like someone or if I've worked with
someone that I'm going to give them a
five-set review or good review if I
don't really enjoy it because then I
don't feel like anyone would really take
me or my reviews seriously so quick
thing about that but I did want to
mention that that I have to work with
her on a professional level but I read
Tainted Love I did not edit the book or
proof read the book or do anything like
that I just read it to kind of get to
know Erin and her work more and this
book it like it like haunted me as I was
reading it I couldn't stop thinking
about it i literally would go to bed and
still be thinking about it and wondering
what was going to happen or than after i
read it i was just like i can't believe
i read that it is it is it is such a
good book it's um it's kind of hard to
read just a warning because it deals a
lot with domestic abuse and domestic
violence and so it's it's kind of hard
to swallow certain parts such a good
book I highly recommend it to women
because you could see the mindset that
the main character had you know
sometimes you read books about some
on who whether they're being abused or
whether it's just like they're being
cheated on or something like that you
can kind of get annoyed with them and
frustrate it with them because they're
like yeah I know like something's wrong
here what are you doing why are you
still involved but the way that it was
written from her perspective it was like
you could you could understand where she
was coming from and even though you
wanted to like scream at her get out and
do something and run it just it was so
good I really hope that you can read
this book because I just thought it was
it was so good it really touched me on a
personal level and I felt like it could
really maybe help a lot of other people
and even if you aren't a victim yourself
or heaven or whatever you know maybe if
you even just known someone or know
someone now I think the book could be
really helpful to you so I liked it on
several levels and I gave it a five
stars because it was a book that meant a
lot to me that I still think about and
that I still recommend to people the
next book that got five stars is called
the marrying type and this is by Laura
Chapman and I have to do another
disclaimer here because laura is one of
my authors with marching ink with the
the publishing company that I own not
actually do the review for her on
Chiclets plus because I don't know
though just be kind of weird if i did
because obviously i loved it when laura
i published Laura's first book as well
hard hats and doormats another really
good book that I recommend she sent me
the the query for the marrying type I
was like yes because I love books about
weddings my fourth book that I'm
currently writing right now I was like
okay hold on we can't release these like
back to back because my book is about a
wedding two different characters
different plot lines I mean they're
they're very different books but I was
like okay we can't release to wedding
books back to back because that beware
so my book is still being written it's
almost done hoping for a summer
but so Laura's got to go first so this
is the marrying type I love the cover
character is Elliot I don't know why I'm
like reading the bag I I've read this
book several times your character is
Elliot and she's a wedding planner and
it's based in the south which I also
like I love books in the south I would
never be able to write one myself
because the south is just like a whole
another entity in itself so i gave like
massive props that to laura that she
wrote this because she lives at nebraska
real close to each other we're gonna
meet one of these days i know we are d
this Elliot was a wedding planner she
gets asked to do a reality TV show her
cousin and she's not really into it at
first but then she realizes her her
mother has previously passed away and
after she died her family finances
aren't in the best shape and once she
finally realizes that and she realizes
how the show could actually help her she
Greece a sign on to the show so you have
like reality TV and weddings going on
it's a great match and then of course
there's a love interest Elliot is
planning a wedding for a bride and groom
and her ex-boyfriend is actually the
bride's brothers so there's a lot to
going on with him it's it's chiclet it's
it's funny it'll make you laugh it's
about weddings it has a cute cover it's
getting great reviews so far release
still really good review so far people
are seeming to really like it so I'm so
happy I'm so happy for Laura and our
reviewer michelle i think i'm pretty
sure michelle is the one that reviewed
the marrying type Rocha clip+ and she
gave it five stars and I was like yay
that's so awesome because my reviewers
are very real to like okay so my
reviewers they don't get I don't pay
them they you know it's just you give
books you review them you know it's the
payout very real to like I even send
them my books or other marching ink
books and they don't always get five
stars
so they're very honest too so I was so
happy when I saw that she gave it five
stars and she loved it so much I thought
that was so exciting so that's another
one that I recommend to you obviously
the next one that got a five star review
was from me and I've actually done a
review video on it so I'll try to
remember to post the link to that video
below but it's called it's called the
other wife and it's by Kathleen Irene
peterka the other way and this one I
mean I talk to you guys I felt like I
couldn't even find the words to say when
I was talking about it in my video
because I loved it so freaking much I
thought it was amazing it's you know the
the title kind of says it there's two
women who are married to the same man
and so that made me have all kinds of
questions about how that could happen
and the husband passes away very
suddenly and leaves everything to the
younger more current wife who he's only
been married to for four years and
basically gives nothing to his wife that
he's been married to it was for like 30
years or something like that everything
that they went through together she you
know goes from a life where she has a
beautiful home and she doesn't have to
work to she has to sell her house she
has to work in a department store to try
to keep bringing money in because
everything got sent to the other wife
when he died and the women eventually
meet and how they meet and how the
ending played out I just thought was so
brilliant because I was trying to figure
out for myself like how is Kathleen
going to write this story and I thought
it was just a phenomenal book so that is
one I like wholeheartedly give five
stars to I thought thought that book was
so good and then the next one is called
the perfume garden and it's by Kate Lord
Browne and our reviewer Kate actually
reviewed it and she gave it five stars
but I did just want to mention
it mostly because like look at this
cover can I hope you guys are seeing
that ok because i think this cover is so
freaking cute ah when i saw it when the
reviewer request came in i looked at the
cover was like I totally want to read
this book just based on the cover alone
but I just I don't have time even though
I want to accept every single review
quest for me I have to remember this is
why I have my team around me to help me
because I can't physically read all of
these books but i thought this cover was
so cute kate gave it five stars she
loved it um let me see it's i think it
was like a more of the historical book
but i might be wrong because it doesn't
say anything about that in the synopsis
so maybe I'm just kidding i will i will
leave Kate's review the link to her
review in the description box if you
guys want to read her full review and
see why she loved it so much and if you
guys want to grab your copy of it I just
loved the cover I just thought that was
so cute I am such a sucker for good
covers and then my last one that I am
going to be talking about is actually i
just mentioned it in my last review
video that i gave it the five stars and
it's low country boneyard by susan boyer
it is from the liz tale bot mystery
series it is book number three in the
series and I kind of mentioned in the
review video that here's the cover but I
kind of mentioned in the review video
that I like mysteries as well and
especially when they're kind of martyr
on the light hearted side they're not
like really scary or gross or violent so
which is definitely the list tail bot
series the entire series I definitely
recommend to you guys because it's so
good Susan's writing just makes the
books just go so fast for for me they
did you follow you the main character is
Liz and so you're following Liz through
each of the
novels there's low country boil
Lowcountry bombshell and low country
boneyard is the most recent one and you
just follow a list through each book as
she has a mystery that she needs to
solve Lowcountry boneyard is there's a
missing woman in her town and it's also
in the self again yay love my other
books um so there's a missing woman and
she's from a very prominent family a
very rich family very powerful family
and they hire Liz who's a private
investigator did I say that weird a
private investigator to try to help find
her and I thought the ending was really
good I kind of mentioned that the ending
took me a little bit by surprise the way
it all worked out with a missing person
but in a good way I absolutely loved it
there's a romance factor involved and
there's also a ghost who I said I was a
real fan of the ghost who it's Liz's
friend choline who has passed away and
now she's a ghost and she's in the other
novels too but in this one she's like
getting really good at being ghostly
like being able to materialize and I
thought that this part was so cool
because there are certain parts and the
novel's where there's situations that
happen and she helps get Liz out of them
like basically she says Liz's life
several times and when like there's a
certain one that's a car accident so a
Carson happens and probably Liz should
have died but when she wakes up in the
hospital people like well they saw a
teenage redheaded woman pulling you away
from the scene and that's what saved
your life and that is who choline is
she's able to materialize as to who she
was when she passed away which happens
to be a teenager so I just thought that
I thought that was so cool I loved
Coleen's character and how she works out
and it I didn't think it was like
gimmicky or weird at all to have the
ghost involved I truly enjoyed reading
about her so I gave that a big five
stars as well and so that is the five
books that we gave five star reviews to
in April on Chiclets plus i will leave
all the links to their reviews in the
description box along with our amazon
links if you are interested in checking
them out the link any videos any review
videos that i've talked about these
books into so you can kind of see what
i've said in other videos but again if
you like the favorites idea please give
this video a thumbs up let me know in
the comments you have any other
suggestions on any other segments that
you might like to see on here and i will
be sure to read those and give them
consideration and thank you so much for
