channel so I'm quite excited for today's
video because it's going to be the first
of its kind but I have basically given
in and finally got a subscription Beauty
subscription box by type thing there are
so many out there but I found one that
I've had my eye on you know I see so
many different youtubers do their own
boxing's and the Instagram pictures
everyone's talking about them so last
month I got the Ipsy glam bag a big part
of the reason why i went with ypsi
because i am a member of FC open studios
which is basically like a community for
beauty creators youtubers instagramers
that sort of thing it's a really great
community that I'm really happy to be a
part of and so I wanted to support
oopsie because they do a lot a lot of
really good things for their community
members and so I thought well why not
get the Ipsy glam bag and see if I like
it so basically this is ten dollars a
month and it's a subscription so just
every like once a month your ten dollars
gets billed you don't have to do
anything for it you can cancel i believe
at any time you can cancel there usually
is a waiting list for this so if you
decide that you don't want it like
really make sure you decide that you
don't want it because probably chances
are the next time you sign up for it you
will be on a waiting list it just
depends how long that waiting list is
for you to get it but ten dollars a
month usually get between four and five
different items this month I got five
items technically I got six because I
got double of one thing but what I
wanted to do with my Ipsy glam bags is
not just do an unboxing and share what I
got because I see so many different
people doing that and if see at least I
can't speak for any other subscription
boxes because I'm not sure if she has
like a plethora of different products
that will be included each month glam
bag and what you do when you sign up for
it see is that you take quizzes and
surveys and let it see know what
products it is that you like what you
don't like what brands you like and they
kind of take that information and give
you your four to five items so not
everybody's bag
exactly the same but there's a lot of
the same repeat products out there and
so when I watch one epsy Klingon big
unboxing I'm like okay great then i
watch the next one I'm like okay well
there was three the same items and then
i watch the next one and I'm like okay
now two of the same items like it kind
of is a little bit repetitive so I was
trying to think of something different
that I could do so basically instead of
just showing the products I'm going to
actually apply what i can to my face
like in this month's bag I have four
different items that I can actually
apply and put on do first impressions of
them so you can see how they apply what
my thoughts are oh I don't know maybe
that will be something kind of fun and
different to do i'm not saying that no
one does is because there definitely is
people that do it so I just kind of
wanted to do that to be a little bit
different and do something more than
just an unboxing and I feel like if I
just did unboxing it would probably take
like two minutes knowing me I talk a lot
so maybe I can stretch it to like five
but that's my plan that's what i'm going
to do i'm not sure i'm going to do it
every single month i think it will
depend on like what is in the bags if i
think i'm going to use all those
products if i'm going to give any away
if i'm going to do any fur give away
things like that i don't want it to get
too repetitive so i don't know we'll see
how the next month's goes you know I
don't know what's going to come in these
bags so I can't say that ahead of time
but maybe you'll see it every month
maybe you only see it every other month
maybe it'll be like even longer in
between I don't know I did just want to
give a little spiel before I jump into
everything about my experience with if
see so you know signing up was fine
taking the servite you know it doesn't
take long and that's fine too my biggest
concern was when I got this bag my
package that it comes in the Ipsy bags
come in like really nice pink sparkly
packages and that's like how you know
it's your FC bag mine came opened it was
oh wait I think I have it it took me a
hot second but I did save the packaging
this is what it looks like and if you
guys can tell I'm trying to like cover
my address while I do this but so you
see that there's no ok so the top does
not look the same this is actually like
a sticky at peace
that should have been taken off so when
you do this it actually seals it so it
only did it on this side where it was
actually removed and so by the time it
actually got to me it came in the mail
like this and I took it out and I was
like what and I opened it in somehow the
bag was still in there you know I don't
know where it came completely unopened
at but I don't know somehow the mail
people are awesome enough that they
didn't just go ahead and like take it
and leave me with an empty envelope
because I was like how did that make it
but what surprised me but most most of
the products were zipped inside the bag
but there was one product that was
outside of the bag like it couldn't fit
I guess I don't know why it wasn't in
there but it in animated and I went to
my Ipsy account because you can check
and see what items that you're getting I
checked to make sure I got everything
that I was supposed to and I was so I
don't know how that happened but that
was a little bit weird to me and I said
something on my snapchat and quite a few
people responded back and said they have
gotten open if see packages before too
so I was like okay but like to the point
where they got him open and things were
missing out of there they did say that
they contacted ypsi and they resent
their items but I'm like what are you
guys doing over there that's a little
crazy so that was like my first like
what a kind of moment and then I went
through everything that I got in my bag
and first impressions off just going
through the items not trying them out
first impressions I was kind of like let
down and I was like I don't know if I
really am gonna like this like either
this project I don't particularly like
what it is or this you know I just have
so many I don't know if I'm ever going
to use that so first impressions of just
me taking them out which I did on
snapchat as well so if you don't follow
me on snapchat I am Samantha dot march i
hope you'll follow me over there i hear
him just tons of fun i might be making
that up i might just say that about
myself but I was kind of like I don't I
don't know I don't know if I really like
this and I will say I've obviously put
everything else on my face before I
found this introduction and I was very
impressed you'll see my first
impressions you'll see me actually
applying everything and giving you my
feedback as I'm do
it for the first time and it truly did
change my mind so you know don't judge a
book on its cover and all that good
stuff because I actually ended up being
very happy with it and there is one
stand out product in here that I can't
wait for you guys to hear about because
it's like five stars all of the 10 stars
can't wait to share that one with you
but that was kind of my initial feedback
and that's kind of why I said maybe you
won't see these glam bag openings every
single month because you know maybe I'm
not going to like next month but now
after applying things for the first time
I'm like maybe I should actually give
them a chance and not just like jump to
a conclusion so I don't know there you
go there's my story I can admit it might
a jump to a conclusion before I actually
tried out products but that's just my
little review on it see all the products
that I talked about will be linked in
the description box below I will also
leave a link to ypsi I think anyone who
signs up with FC gets like a referral
link and if you use my link to sign up I
get like a point or something and you
can build points in exchange them for
something I'm really not sure I haven't
looked into it too much because I just
signed up for it I don't have any points
the other I don't think I've no idea how
I would have earned any points but I
wanted to throw that out there it's
technically I guess an affiliate link
it's not monetary value but you get
points so if you use my link thank you
you've given me points that's fantastic
but let's stop talking sorry that was a
long steel but this is the first timer
video so I had to kind of explain myself
if you would like to see my April FC
glam bag unboxing tutorial reviews force
impressions and all that good stuff in a
certain on with my eyes so I'm going to
use from nomads cosmetics this is their
eye shadow in desert sands so looks like
that very pretty swash on my wrist if
you can see it so this since this is a
shimmer color I'm going to put this all
over my lid so I'm actually going to
come in first with a crease color use
creme brulee from makeup geek this is
the top center one right here it's just
a really nice light brown shade and I'm
going to apply that to my crease using
my
big fluffy blending brush from
bhcosmetics um it's very fluffy and I
don't feel like I need anything like
precisely in my crease which is why LFE
brush can work but I can't find a mirror
got one okay so i'm just going to do
creme brulee real quick like in my
crease my eyes are primed with my
concealer i used the maybelline fit me
concealer because I did majority of my
face before I hopped on here okay and
then I'm going to take just a flat
eyeshadow brush again from it bh
cosmetics and then come in with the
desert sands so let's see what did this
looks like oh yeah that's really pretty
it reminds me of something it reminds me
I think it reminds me of a makeup geek
shadow hold on i'm going to do
comparison swatches here in a hot second
so I'm not familiar with Nomad cosmetics
um I've actually never even heard of the
brand so that's always fun to get things
from brands that you haven't heard of
because there's so many out there like
it's impossible to know them all so
that's very cool I was looking on the
Ipsy website at this Nomad and it said
for like application tips it did say to
apply or two like dampen your brush and
then apply the shadow and I was going to
do it first look out like mac fix+ and
then I was going to spray my brush but
honestly like I don't feel the urge to
have to spray my brush like this is very
very pigmented I'm very very shimmery
like do you see how pretty that is I
think that is really really pretty so I
just have that applied all over my lid
I'm just going to come back in with that
fluffy blending brush with no product on
it and just do a quick sweep in my
crease to get rid of any harsh lines in
case there are any but first impressions
yes this is a really nice shadow I was
first applying it I thought maybe it
looked similar to I think this is called
glamorous by makeup geek yeah this is
glamorous by makeup geek and then desert
sands they looked kind of similar so I'm
going to swatch both of them on my hand
okay desert sands is a little bit like
what I wants a lighter brighter and
glamorous is a little bit darker but
very similar different but similar I'm
glad they're like super the same because
you know that i have would have to but
so yeah desert sands from nomads
cosmetics i'm i'm very impressed with
that I thought that was very very pretty
so I'm going to finish off my eyes real
quick off camera and then all these
items we're going to try out is blush so
this is show me your cheeks from
elizabeth mot so it's just a nice pink
blush looks very nice and then we also
got a brush this is
from crown brushes and it's a duo fiber
brush it looks like this and this is the
sea for 27 as the tapered duo fiber
brush brush and I'm really excited
because I do like duo fibers for blush
especially for color pop blushes and I
only have the m4 27 from morphe 0427
that's weird from morphe is our morphine
crown are linked aren't they okay that
would make more sense then because as I
said it out loud I was like wait that's
really weird but i think morphine and
crown are like somehow something you
like the duo fiber is especially for
color pop so the elizabeth moths blush
this is in peach pink which I love peach
right now this is $23 the crown brush is
14 17 in Euros I I don't know what that
equals to in dollars but yeah so I'm
just going to go ahead and apply and see
what this looks like on the cheeks and
on the Ipsy website it says the
Elizabeth not blushes are really good
for you can like apply a little for a
subtle glow or you can easily build
these up so that is what I am
investigating original this does look
really pretty it's got a really nice PG
Sheen to it yeah that's pretty is that
sometimes the camera doesn't really like
to pick up blush but that looks really
pretty you guys oh okay brush feels nice
I don't have any crown brushes so I was
pretty excited when I saw a brush house
even more excited when I saw that
somehow the brush actually made it
because everything else was actually
like zipped inside the Ipsy bag but the
brush was just like hanging out so I
cannot believe that the brush actually
made it have this looks really pretty
this is a really really nice blush i'm
not i'm not gonna lie i'm pretty happy
with this blush so i did i did it more
softly which you know would have been
fine and now i'm slowly like building it
up and it seems very buildable
like it said it would and definitely has
more color to it so yeah that's really
pretty I like that in this blush or this
brush this blush brush like I said I
really do like duo fiber brushes I've
been needing more of them so not mad
that I got one of these again if you
guys are looking for a good brush to use
with color pop blushes especially
because the colour-pop formula is so
like difference in texture dual fibers
are a really really good option for that
so yeah this is the c-4 27 from crown
okay and then the last item that I have
to apply is from a tart it is one of
their lips urgent's lip creams I think
it's in wonder hmmm looks like this so
this obviously is a little guy but the
full-size is twenty-four dollars it says
that you know mostly it's for a lip
color but says you can also apply it to
your cheeks as a blush um I don't know
about that since I got a blush I won't
be trying that out but this is what it
looks like that's a nice color I have to
say I'm a huge fan of tart I love tired
of buying more from tard I'm so happy
that I am I don't really like these lip
crayons though and I haven't tried this
on my lips yet so I can't review this
one but i think it was when i did my
decluttering I got rid of so many
different lip crayons because i just i
don't really like applying them and i
just don't really enjoy them so when I
saw this I was like ooh lip crayons
don't really like them but ok but we'll
give it a try we'll see what it looks
like on the lips it smells minty and
notice that right away I'm i do just
have a look gloss on underneath I know I
get asked a lot of questions and I
address this on my snapchats other night
too like especially when I post lip
videos like on Instagram people are like
what do you have before you pull a
lipstick on your lips it's just a lip
gloss or a lip balm or something I
always have something on my lips like my
lips are very rarely ever dry mostly
just because I wear so many liquid
lipsticks like I just feel like I need
to always be hydrating
again I do try to mostly remove anything
that i have on my lips before I apply
anything because I don't want it to like
interfere like especially if i'm testing
something or trying it out for the first
time i'll try to like white most fit
away but i think i just always have so
much lip gloss on like it just doesn't
go away i feel that with highlight too
does anyone else like there are days
where i have a completely clean face and
I go to apply highlight and I'm like I
swear it looks like there's already
highlight there because I think I just
wear so much highlight anyone else cuz I
happens me okay so this is a pretty
color it's like a punch pink i would say
goes well with the eyes like the eyes
are like fairly neutral so a nice pop of
color on the lips looks good feels good
it has like the minty smell to it and it
kind of feels a little like minty and
refreshing on the lips I think the
TARDIS lip paints do as well so they're
called TARDIS lip paints their the
liquid lipsticks from Tarte they also
have that's like minty smell in kind of
a feel when you put it on your lips so
yeah I like the color the application
was fine again I'm just I'm not a huge
fan of lip crayons well pretty summer
color feels nice on the lips a nice slip
cream hmm not mad about it and since
this is such a small size it'll be easy
to like throw in my purse if I ever like
need something on my lips a little pop
of color this could be a good one to go
for so so that is all the products that
I can put on my face the eyeshadow the
blush using the blush brush and then the
tart lip cream I did get one more item
in my bag that I want to share with you
but I can't actually like do this on
camera because that would probably be
like really weird I mean I could but it
would be weird but we also got these pur
Lisse sheet masks and I have no idea how
to pronounce this brands name peerless
pianist mmm i'm not sure but this is the
blue lotus plus white tea treatment
sheet mask it says it's intensely
moisturizing nourishing and renewing so
we actually got two of these in the bag
I used one so I could actually review it
in this video and let me just tell you i
am so glad that i did that because this
what's freaking bomb oh my word I used
it must have been the last week that I
used it and I am so so happy with it and
I have just been itching to use this one
but I like no you need to share about it
in the video you need to share and then
you can put it back on this was the most
hydrating mask I have ever used I think
ever as I was simply applying it to my
face so it is a sheet mask so it just
looks like a sheet that has cutouts for
your eyes and for your nose and for your
lips and so you just place it over your
face kinda press it down and then it
adheres to your face basically I just
laid around 45 minutes I think it was
that you put it on or no 15 to 20
minutes and I remember because I left it
on for 25 minutes like I was like let me
just stretch it a little bit longer
because I don't want to take this off my
face and it was like the second that I
put it down I was like this is awesome
it was so hydrating it felt so fantastic
on my skin every once awhile I would
just go in and I would kind of like rub
it over my skin it mentioned to do that
like help everything's soaked into the
skin better it felt awesome I absolutely
loved it I cannot wait to use these
again these are eight dollars on the
website everything that i have mentioned
i will leave that linked down below
let's see it says beauty through asian
wisdom it says this natural fiber mask
is infused with blue lotus and white tee
and restorative asian botanicals and
delivers antioxidants and minerals to
your skin this power blend fights free
radicals improve skin texture while
white mulberry brightens in Annie's
helps firm skin leaving complexion
healthy beautiful and youthful looking
so you start with clean skin put the
mask on you let it sit for 15 to 20
minutes and then you don't rinse it says
let your skin absorb the essence by
gently massaging the skin and you're
supposed to use it one to two times a
week I thought these are fantastic if
you're looking for really good sheet
masks and I know there's so many sheep
mascot right now like sheep mouths are
like just totally the thing and
everyone's coming out with them but
these I thought were so good sorry up
like the glare is weird these were so
good
only recommend so impressed with these
very happy I got it and now I can't wait
to use this one is everything for my
