I'm hoping to make this just a short one
it's going to be our book favorites from
the month of August that had five star
reviews on chocolate plus I'm like
barely keeping it together right now
I've been so sick all weekend i have
some sort of like sinus infection going
on in my head hurts to keep my eyes open
and just to sit upright because it's in
my ears and like my balance and
equilibrium is all up and i really just
want to go back to bed but I have so
many videos planned for this week and
some that are like in a timely manner so
I was like no I need to least try to
film this because I feel like it's going
to take me a few days to edit just
because I've been so sick so I apologize
for my voice and for my appearance but I
really wanted to get this over you guys
so if you would like to see the books
that got five star reviews on chocolate
plus in the month of August the first
one is we never asked for wings and this
is by Vanessa diffenbaugh hmm and this
review was from Annie it says from the
beloved New York Times bestselling
author of the language of flowers comes
her much anticipated new novel about
young love hard choices and hope against
all odds and is a review from Leah and
this is the missing mahjong player I'm
not exactly totally positive how do you
say that that is by iris win and it says
stevewade is an ex-cop with an ex-wife
and girlfriends he could never commit to
now he's a private investigator known
for his lack of solving crimes sounds
like he's a private eye and his newest
case involves five frantic mahjong
players who are in search of one of
their players who disappeared after
meeting a man on an internet dating site
one is one that I reviewed and it is
cashing in and this is by Tracy krimmer
and I've just been recently reading some
Tracy's books and I think they are so
good I've been giving her five star
reviews all over the place so definitely
recommend Tracy krimmer for you guys I
when I have was also five stars from me
and this is
Roman love by Anita Hughes and I've said
on my channel before I absolutely love
Anita Hughes his books I love they tend
to take place like in different
countries and it's really fun to travel
along with the character so needy Hughes
is one of my favorite authors this one
is a five-star review from Annie this is
the word game by steno homes and I know
I've heard from this author as well and
all of her books are really great so I'm
happy to see that even some of the other
review team members are finding her
books to be five star material and how I
mentioned cashing in by Tracy creamer
earlier I also reviewed her novel
jaywalking in the month of August on
chocolate plus and I gave it five stars
so yes Tracy creamer is definitely one
that I am recommending she has several
books out now so all of the links to
every book that I've mentioned will of
course be in the description box below
it is a five star review from Annie and
it is conscience by cecilia london love
that cover this is book to in a series
the first book is dissident and annie
also read and reviewed that one so i
will leave the links to that review
below as well so you can check out both
of those books in the series the next
one is also 5 stars from Annie this is a
man of character by Margaret lucky i
think is the last name Margaret lucky oh
so sorry for my energy you guys I can't
believe I can't believe how sick I am
like I went down hard this weekend it's
miserable but the next one is a five
star from me and this was the best of
enemies by jen lancaster and i also did
a full review video on just this book
not too long ago so it'll either be
linked like somewhere up here or in the
description box below so i did a full
video just on this one because i loved
it so much so gay 5 stars2 unraveled in
new york and this is by suzanne nicole i
love this cover i love the book it's
about an australian that comes to New
York and there's you know of course ja
the shoes and romance and all that good
stuff but I loved it this one is a
five-star review from Emma and the
says mrs. Sinclair's suitcase and this
is by Louise Walters this a
heartbreaking and deeply compelling
debut of mrs. Sinclair's suitcase is a
compulsive pain paige Turner about ward
at love dashed hopes and family secrets
book club fiction at its best had a five
star review for bad medicine and this is
my Carolyn faradaic far dig I think was
farting she told me online she told me
online cuz I imagine her previous video
ah think of it I'm blaming the sickness
today and blaming his sickness gosh my
voices in the same is a book three in
the Lizzie heart mystery series i
absolutely love good mystery series and
this is definitely one I recommend to
check out he also had a five star review
for bounce and this is by Noel August
looks like this is a part of the
boomerang series I'm not sure which book
it is in the series but it does say that
is the part of the boomerang series so
that is bounced and the final five star
review is the tea planters wife and this
is by deena Jefferies it says in edina
Jeffrey's unforgettable new novel the
tea planters wife is a haunting tender
portrait of a woman forced to choose
between her duty as a wife and her
instinct as a model made it through that
video I honestly I wonder if I'll even
keep this video I don't know I might try
to rerecord it will see how I feel like
it turns out and editing obviously my
hair is not done I have I don't have
anything on my face I did put some blush
on that's the only thing I have on my
face is some blush dishes I like try to
give myself some color I actually put
the mary-lou manizer highlighter on my
eyes as eyeshadow because I did not have
the energy to reach up to my eyeshadow
palettes and my highlighter was in my
bag so that's what i put on my eyelids
and then i put some blue eyeliner to try
to like open up my eyes and a little bit
of mascara and called it a day and I'm
like oh guys not sure how this is going
