today's video is going to be my August
reading list wrap-up reviews so each
book that I myself reviewed for
chocolate plus and august i will be
discussing and reviewing here for you i
did recently do my august book favorites
and that is all the books on chocolate
plus at myself and the chiclet plus
review team reviewed and gave 5 stars2
so i will link it up here and it also be
in the description box below so any
books that i mentioned that i gave 5
stars2 in august i won't really touch on
those in this video I'll distract you to
watch the favorites video because they
are mentioned there but if you would
like to see and hear about all the books
that i read in august then please keep
watching first one that i have is
absolutely true lies and this is by
rachel Stoller and I just turned my
surface off how did I manage that um but
I really really liked this one I gave it
4.5 stars on Chiclets plus and basically
we follow holly who gets a job as a
ghostwriter to a celebrity and she kind
of gets involved in the celebrities life
and understands like how she works how
her schedule works how poor people work
and all that sort of thing and what I
found really interesting about the book
is that it's mentioned I believe it's in
the synopsis that it says fun juicy and
inspired by Rachel stiller's own
stranger than fiction experiences as a
celebrity ghost writer so I thought that
was really interesting because then it's
kind of like you know of course I
haven't seen in the research that I did
who rachel ghost wrote for because
that's kind of the point of a ghost
writer is that you don't know your book
has been written by someone else I mean
that's if you don't know what a ghost
writer is a ghost writer is a lot of
celebrities will hire ghost writers
because they want to write a book but
they can't actually write a book not
saying that they can't write but you
know maybe their schedule doesn't allow
and are things like that so they hire an
author to write the book for them but
the
author is not known it doesn't say you
know Samantha Marge but also written by
you know so and so it will just say the
celebrity's name if it's a ghost writer
but then the ghost writer usually gets
paid quite handsomely to be kept quiet
and not fit that they wrote that book
does that make sense ok that was really
interesting that this is what the author
you know has kind of based her story on
because then as you're reading the book
and all these like crazy wild things are
happening you're like Who I wonder if
that's really true or I could totally
see this celebrity doing it so it was a
lot of fun to read and holly was i
thought a very likable character and
very relatable so that made the story
even better to me so that's definitely
one that I would recommend one that i
have is Sex Lies and cruising and this
is by Katherine Chapman and this was
another one that I found be so great I
give another 4.5 stars on at Chiclets
plus and I just thought it was so funny
now the content inside the book is
definitely foreign more mature audience
so I would definitely recommend that you
are a little older because sex
definitely is a hot topic in the book
basically we follow Ellie and she is
recently single after her fiance has
cheated on her and she gets a
photography job on a cruise ship which
immediately like the setting i thought
was so much fun on the cruise ship going
to all these like islands and locations
i thought was really fun to read about
she really wants to find someone and she
kind of goes through these guys and it
was just so much fun to read about i
laughed pretty much throughout the whole
book and I i believe i mentioned in my
review like I just wanted to hug Ellie
several times I just wanted to hug her
and be like it'll be okay you don't have
to keep sleeping with guys and thinking
that they're going to fall in love with
you just because you've let them into
your bed so but it definitely was a
really fun book I highly recommend that
if you are older and can handle reading
more mature content then I definitely do
recommend this one side a lot of fun
reading it but next one I have is
cashing in and this is my Tracy krimmer
I actually gave this one five stars so
be sure to check out the August book
favorites video because my full review
will be
in there and of course the amazon links
for all these books will be in the
description box below along with my
review on chocolate plus was also a
five-star book and this is roman love
and this is by anita hughes needy he was
one of my favorite authors highly
recommend anything by her but go ahead
and check out the August favorites video
for my review on that one so what I have
is the summertime girls and this is by
Laura Hanken and I like reading books
like this that you know focus on a
friendship um there are some of my
favorite books to read besides Chiclets
I like to explore the friendship between
women I think it's really fascinating
when we follow Ali and Beth and they
were you know best friends since they
were young they went through a lot
together but then they start to slowly
grow apart and we kind of see as we read
along the book we kind of see how they
got torn apart almost and how when one
really needed the other one the other
one wasn't there for whatever reason and
vice versa so we kind of understand how
their friendship unraveled I thought it
was really interesting because there's a
subplot involving one of the characters
grandmother's and almost like her own
friendship that unraveled throughout the
years as well it doesn't get touched on
a whole lot like it's not an
overwhelming subplot at any point but it
was just kind of interesting to the book
to see how it happened I thought that
was a really cute bit I I didn't feel at
any point in the book like I was I don't
want to say that I wasn't super invested
because I was interested in the story
and I was curious to see how it would
play out and all that good stuff the
word that I used to describe it in my
review was that it was a steady read
like it read in a very steady pace there
wasn't really a lot of ups and downs for
me there wasn't any point Rose like oh
this feels like a cliffhanger like I
can't stop reading this chapter to read
the next chapter but I I liked it and I
gave it four stars on Chiclets plus is
another one from Tracy krimmer and this
is called jaywalking so this is another
one that I gave five stars to these for
jaywalking and caching and were the
first two books that I
read by Tracy and I absolutely love them
I think she's a really fantastic writer
so definitely not fair to check out if
you haven't and I have is the best of
enemies and this is by jen lancaster and
not only did i give it five stars so it
will be in the August favorites video
but I also did a full video review here
on YouTube and kind of went a little bit
more in depth than I do in the regular
review videos so if you want to check
that one out i will be sure to link it
up here and it will also be in the
description box below along with it was
on link to the book and then also my
review on chocolate plus next one is
unraveled in New York and this is by
Suzanne Nicole absolutely love this
cover but I did give it five stars so
again with me in the August review video
but definitely love the story of an
Australian coming to New York and
everything that shit gets into so highly
recommend that one and the last one that
I have to talk about is bad medicine and
this is my Carolyn ferdig again another
five-star review I had such a wonderful
August of reading list clearly so it
will be in the August favorites video
