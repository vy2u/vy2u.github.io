channel today's video I'm going to doing
another like author focus video and I
asked for suggestions a few weeks ago on
social media and someone mentioned doing
like an author do and don't and I
thought about doing something specific
and then I couldn't figure out what
specifically to focus on so I decided
just to do like a more general author
doin don't video so I have five dudes
that I recommend and five don'ts that I
suggest against am I published author i
am also a publisher i do on at the indy
press marching inc IMO sell a book
blogger I work heavily in the book
industry between blogging publishing
writing marketing editing all that sort
of good things but these are just my
suggestions these are my humble opinions
and advice you can choose to listen to
what I say you ever if if you're doing
something that works for you and I say
something that maybe you're not doing
but it works a different way for you
keep doing what works for you we're all
different we all have different
experiences especially when it comes to
like genre so what works in like a
romance and Chiclets genre doesn't work
in like sci-fi and horror genre so if
you're doing something that works for
you do what works for you I just want to
put it out there that these are just my
opinions my suggestions my advice things
that I have seen that have worked
throughout my seven years in the
industry so just want to throw that out
there before people like you yell at me
because we all know when we put
ourselves out on social media and we do
these kinds of videos we get a lot of
like harsh feedback at times but just
want to clear that up before I get into
the video if you would like to see some
of my opinions advices and tips for
authors do's and don'ts please keep
watching one of my biggest pieces of
advice and like this is what I say is
like a must do for authors is to be on
social media hopefully if you are
watching this and you're an author you
are familiar with a social media but you
need to be out there because that is
where
everybody is I mean everyone is on some
sort of social media platform so you
need to get out there you need to make
sure you have you know i would say like
at least two to three social media
platforms if not more I'm not saying
that you need to go out and join every
single social media outlet there is
because that's too overwhelming I don't
do that a lot of us don't have time for
that but you need to at least be out
there in some way because social media
is such a terrific way to connect with
your readers social media I know has its
downfalls but it also very much has its
positives and it's because we can reach
out and we can literally become friends
with our readers and you see it more and
more it's such a fabulous way to connect
with people when I first started
blogging and I started becoming friends
with people in the virtual world it was
like a it literally was like a whole new
world opened up for me I am someone who
am a voracious reader I absolutely love
books and I don't have a lot of people
around me who are big readers and so I
really didn't have that outlet to be
able to talk to other people about the
books i was reading the books that i
loved my dreams of becoming a writer
myself and once i got online and started
in the blogging community and i opened
up this world with friends who had the
same interest in me it changed my life
and I say that in all seriousness such a
crazy unique I mean something I never
would have thought have happened if I
had I now have friends all over the
world I've been able to travel to meet
some of these people like it's so crazy
to me but definitely as an author you
want to get on social media you want to
connect with your readers you want to
make friends with them because if you
make friends with them they're able to
form a connection to you even if you
never meet and you only speak via social
media they'll feel connection with you
so when you put a book out there like
hey my friend she's gonna put a book out
soon I should probably buy it I should
read it I should review it I should tell
other people about it because we have
such a great connection on social media
like we should do that so my biggest
piece of advice really is to get on
social media I know it can be hard I
know it can be confusing there's also a
lot of companies out
air and I do it myself to that help you
navigate their social media help you put
your profiles up there help you get
ideas of what to talk about I remember
when I first got on Twitter and I was
like not a clue what am I supposed to do
what am I supposed to talk about this is
stupid for the longest time when I got
on Twitter I couldn't figure out how to
get like the notifications of like where
other people who are talking to me
couldn't find that button to save my
life I mean I didn't I was so confused
there's a lot of different companies and
individuals out there that will help you
there's forms out there there's blog
posts there's youtube videos there's so
many ways out there to get helpful with
social media but that's really like one
of my biggest pieces of advice is be
sure to get on social media of my
biggest don'ts for authors is don't
respond to like negative reviews on your
book and I say this because I see it so
often if someone reviews your book and
they don't like it and they critique it
and then authors come in and respond on
some sort of social media platform you
either respond on the blog you respond
on their YouTube video you respond on
their Instagram post you respond on
their Twitter and I've seen authors
respond in ways that they're like
defiant they're like well I mean it was
written this way you just didn't
understand it I've seen them angry I've
seen authors call reviewers names it's
just not pretty and it doesn't look
professional you don't need to try to
defend yourself because not everyone is
going to love your book it's just the
way of life not everyone's going to like
your book not everyone's going to
connect with your book does it make me
angry when I see bad reviews out there
and when I see reviews that I'm like so
for example my third book a questionable
friendship does not have a happy ending
and I put that in the synopsis it says
it right there there is not a happy
ending in the cards for everyone because
I wanted people to be forewarned some
people only want to read books with
happy endings that's fantastic this
isn't the book for you I put that in the
synopsis and I had a reviewer right I
was so disturbed by the ending I can't
believe there wasn't a happy ending blah
blah blah you know how bad I wanted to
write I told you that
I warned you I warned you of that if you
want to read the synopsis I wouldn't ill
do that but you can't say anything
because it makes you look incredibly
unprofessional when you do that even if
you're trying to be very fair in the way
that you say it it still comes up is
that you're looking petty and you're
looking a professional and I know that
it's so hard to close your mouth and
step away from the keyboard when you see
those comments but sometimes what I'll
do is I'll right I don't usually respond
directly just in case I accidentally hit
a button but a lot of times what I do is
I pull up a word doc I type my response
I get it all out i get all mad and I
just delete it move on that's the word
that I get over with it but if you have
your own thing that you want to do go
ahead but it's a piece of advice that is
around so much so many people warned
authors not to do this and author still
do it it's just a bad decision just let
those reviews go I know that everyone's
going to Larry will do that I suggest
for authors is do hire professionals
when it comes to your book and I'm
meeting for cover design I'm meeting for
proofreading for editing for formatting
your books and I feel like this sounds
like very common knowledge like hey hire
professionals for what you do for your
profession but I cannot get over how
many authors I hear say that they did
not hire professionals and it blows my
mind to hear that to hear people say
well I I skipped over having an editor
or I just proof wrote it myself like
things like that it just it really does
blow my mind because you can tell you
you truly can tell if you don't hire a
professional cover designer and your
cover doesn't look well covers are the
very first thing that is going to reach
your readers and if the cover doesn't
pull them in or entice them or look
professional they're not going to want
to do it if you're not going to put the
professional quality into your book
readers aren't going to want to read it
because readers are pretty savvy we can
tell when you are not putting forth your
best foot and if this is your passion
this is your career this is your
profession you need to try to have all
the pieces into place when it comes to
hiring people and I understand
that hiring people can be expensive but
especially as the self publishing
industry girls there is so many people i
mean new companies new individuals are
popping up every single day offering you
know sometimes they're new and starting
out they they have good credentials but
they don't have a lot of clients yet so
their prices are lower you know you can
always find someone who is more
inexpensive but is still a professional
I know if my first book i was totally
overwhelmed when i got the first quote
from my editor but i thought to myself
well I mean if I'm going to do it I'm
gonna do it I'm not gonna half-ass
anything because this is what I want out
of my life so I know it can be
overwhelming to see the numbers when you
first get them in but it will really
make it worth it in the long run another
don't i have is don't ignore your
readers your readers are obviously like
your most important people like you
don't want to ignore them and i see it
so often where you know if we should be
on social media like i was saying but
readers will comment on you know
Facebook pages Twitter's instagrams etc
and authors are not responding to them
and the feedback that I get from certain
authors is you know I'm just too busy or
I have too many comments or etc I I
totally understand that as well I get
that but we also don't want to ignore
our readers and I just think it's very
important to try to spend a few minutes
of your day or even a few minutes of
your week just to have some sort of time
salat it out so you can go through your
notifications and you can go through
your your feedback comments that you've
gotten on your post things like that I
have a lot of different social media
pages I get a lot of different comments
in a lot of different areas and it is
very hard to keep up with but I still do
it do I do it as they come in no because
that's too overwhelming to me what I do
is like how I said I take a few usually
it's every day that I try to do it
because this is my full-time job this is
what I do all day every day is work with
books but I try to take a few minutes
out of every single day it's usually
when I'm like winding down I'm watching
youtube videos i'm just hanging out I'll
pull my phone up
go through my notifications I'll respond
back to people I'll talk to people and
again it's just a really great way to
form a connection we don't ever want to
get like a big head in the industries
what I like to think of it if you start
to think you're too good for your
readers for your fans for the people who
are taking their time to tell you stuff
if we just start to ignore them they're
going to feel ignored and they're not
going to care anymore they're not going
to want to reach out to you because why
are they going to bother you're not
responding to them anyways so that's
just a really big piece of advice I can
give is just don't ignore your readers
we want them to stay your readers
another big piece of advice that I think
sounds very like cliche but i think is
very true it's just half passion have
passion in what you do I say this
because i have talked to authors in my
years who don't seem to care they don't
seem to care about their books they
don't seem to really care about their
writing it's like it's almost just like
something they do as an afterthought
they just don't truly care about what
they're doing and I think that can
relate in your writing I think that can
relate in the way that you handle your
marketing I think it can relate in the
way that you talk to your readers as
like we can tell if you don't have
passion or you don't care about what it
is you're doing and no matter what it is
you choose to do in life hopefully what
you choose to do you have a passion
behind that I understand that some of us
have to work jobs because we need them
we need the paychecks we need to take
the steps forward but hopefully you have
something else in your life that you
have passion about that you can do so
whether that be like for me I have a
very big passion for yoga I practice
yoga every single day I run an Instagram
account with my best friend where the
cheeky chicks and hopefully you can tell
by what we do and what we share and what
we run that we have passion and what
we're doing there so I hope that one
makes sense but I just think if you are
going to work in an industry and do
something like writing books and
connecting with so many people like I
just hope that you can be passionate
about it because if you are it just will
make it so much better a dump that i
have is don't cut
corners and this can relate to so many
facets of being an author of publishing
of talking to your readers etc and I
feel like I've kind of touched on some
of them but what kind of what i mean by
don't cut corners is you know just don't
take any easy way out don't forget to
hire your professionals like a lot of
times all here not a lot of times i have
heard people say you know I didn't hire
an editor because i had beta readers
that's fantastic I think you should have
beta readers I think that might be on my
do list is to have beta readers you
should have beta readers but unless your
beta readers are actually editors as
well you still need a higher your editor
and that's fantastic that your friend
who likes to read proof read the book
for you but you still need to have a
professional proofreader go through the
book for you so don't cook corners again
it's something that I feel like people
will be able to tell if you're cutting
the corners and you just simply
shouldn't want to you should want your
book and you should want you as a brand
as the author you should want to be the
best that you can be and cutting corners
as the mytab comes with like more of
like the publishing aspect of the of the
book process and that is experimenting
and what I mean by that is experimenting
with different ways of marketing seeing
what works for you what doesn't work for
you making sure that you keep detailed
notes and lists on hey I tried this
website for promotion and dint work out
for me probably won't try that again but
I use this list and it worked super well
also meaning amazon has their KDP select
program which is where your ebook will
be published exclusively through amazon
you would want to be able to have your
book on like Nook Kobo iTunes that sort
of thing your ebook would have to be
exclusive to Amazon for at least a three
month time period some books thrive in
the select program other books do not I
have some authors with marching ink
whose books do so well on kobo and so I
would never want to put them into the
select program and lose the Kobo seals
that we have in
are one of my books my first book
destined to fail for some reason does so
well it does better on kobo than it does
on amazon which is just like bizarre
because my other three books do better
on Amazon that they do on kobo and
barnes and noble combined it's so crazy
but each book is very different and you
kind of want to experiment you want to
play a run you see want to see what
works best what retailers your books
that vest on what website promotions
worked for you experiment with the price
of your book I mean yes we you can do
price promotions where your book is free
or 99 cents but you can also see does
your book sall good at 299 does it still
sell well at 399 we have some books with
marching ink that just sells so well so
we haven't priced at 399 because they
still sell at 399 we have books that
sell it to 99 and I've tried to put them
to 399 and they don't sell so we put
them back to 299 it's all this like an
experiment you've got to see what works
for you but just don't be afraid to try
different things don't I have is don't
be alone and what I mean by that is that
it goes back to social media and the
wonderful connections that we have out
there I belong to several author groups
these are mostly on facebook where you
can create like a Facebook group I
belong to several like genre focused
author groups where we talk to each
other every day we can give each other
advice if we have questions we can ask
each other a lot of these groups have
like specific themes for each day like
meet me monday we talk about ourselves
usually a leader will ask you know some
sort of question we can watch i'm in we
get to have a day where we share
something we share our book with share
promotion you know I share your YouTube
video something like that we have days
where we can brag about like good
accomplishments that we've done we help
support each other we help tweet each
other it's a huge support group and it's
so fabulous and I've done a book events
in the past where I've been able to like
meet these other women and authors in
these groups and I've got to travel to
book events and meet them and it's so
wonderful to be able to have those
connections with people and also do have
that help there's times where I've done
it myself I've seen other authors do it
like I'm down I'm in a slump my sales
aren't good
don't know what to do and you can go
into your group and you can say that and
other people can lift you back up and
make you feel motivated again and it's
such a wonderful thing with social media
and the way that it is and the reach
that we can have there's no reason that
you should have to do this alone so my
group my suggestion is to definitely
find different groups maybe they'll be
on social media maybe they'll be groups
that you can physically go to I just
found out in my town there's like a
certain group that meets once a month
for writers in the Des Moines area and I
really want to check it out at least
once and see how it goes it makes me
kind of nervous because I'm definitely
an introvert but I'm excited to do it
because it's a great way to form
connections and definitely get support
in motivation another do that i have for
authors is do get opinions on your book
before you publish it get your beta
readers I have three beta readers that I
use on a pretty consistent basis and so
what that is it's after I write my book
it's finished it's done but it hasn't
gone to an editor yet hasn't gone to the
proofreader I'm not even thinking about
publishing it yet I send it to my beta
readers all these girls are somehow in
the book community either book bloggers
or somehow they are involved in the book
community which to me i think is really
helpful but i send it to them for their
feedback I do this because a lot of
times after we've we've written our
first drafts then we rewrote scenes and
then maybe we wrote huge chunks of the
book but it gets to a point where I'm so
immersed in my story that I can't really
tell if a plus B equals C I can't tell
if we've gotten there because now the
story is so like in my head and I know
what I want my characters to say and do
I can't tell if it's like making sense
anymore and so that's when I got to send
it out and be like you guys tell me if
it makes sense because I don't know can
you want people who are going to be
honest with you you don't want people
that are just going to come back and be
like that was really good thumbs up like
you won't be able to be like hit this
part didn't make sense you know um my
last book up to i do i have this big
this big scene where the husband
until the fiancee won't tell his
bride-to-be where they're going on their
honeymoon and he's going to surprise her
with the honeymoon and it says it
several times in the book you know he's
going to surprise her and then I
completely forgot to put that in there
and one of my favorite writers wrote
back and was like hey um what happened
to the honeymoon and I was like oh dear
Lord so that's why you have them they
can offer you suggestions and critiques
of course in a nice way but it can still
help you because it's only going to make
your book better so have beta readers
you know sometimes I'll send my books to
like my mom and she can help give me
feedback she's a very tough critic and
she saw was a really good at
proofreading for me she finds mistakes
that I miss and it's just good to get
opinions and feedback in addition to
your editor so you know sometimes even
your proof reader can make editing
comments but it's good to have that
because those are your readers and you
want to make sure your book is
resonating with your readers my very
last don't is another like kind of like
social media tip but it's one that I see
out there a lot but then I still see a
lot of authors doing it and that is only
being on social media to sell yourself
and sell your books and what I mean by
that is only seeing authors who post
facebook posts or Twitter or Instagram
posts just being like buy my book buy my
book hey my books out buy my book did
you know my books up did you know I
publish a book my book is on sale buy my
book because that can get very very
annoying I will go through what I do
because at the same time you're on
social media because you are trying to
sell yourself you are trying to sell
your books you are trying to find more
readers but it's like where do you find
that balance and this is something that
actually was brought to my attention
probably within the past like 16 months
or so and I really try to refocus my
social media strategy to try to figure
out how to be better and not just so
myself online so what I do is I'm very
much like a scheduler person I have to
have a set schedule down or else I'm
just confused and I don't know what's
going on but what I do is I post on my
social media at least six times a day so
six posts a day social media or Facebook
Twitter there is ways to schedule post
so you don't have to feel like you're
always at you
puter there is websites like hoot suit
where you can schedule and they'll go
out at certain times so those are really
helpful but what I do is I post every to
personal posts to one cell post that
makes sense so for my personal post I'll
just talk about the weather I'll share
my yoga pictures I shall purchase up my
dogs I'll save funny quotes I'll just
say what I'm thinking what's on the top
of my head i'll say that i want vacation
and i'm tired of the snow that sort of
thing and then when i do my cell post
sometimes I'm like hey look my books on
amazon or hey look at this five-star
review but sometimes my cell post is
just acknowledging that I'm an author
hey I wrote a scene today hashtag am
writing you know like Oh still working
on rewrites for book 5 hashtag and
meditate that sort of thing so it's not
really like a cell post i'm not posting
any links to amazon or goodreads are
asking for reviews or things like that
but i'm just acknowledging hey I'm an
author this is what I do okay post as
many times a day as you want as you
don't want you can schedule posts I mean
that's just my piece of advice that's
just what I do but readers will
definitely connect with you on more than
just a like bye-bye both by my book by
my book level and i have found once i
started posting other things that my
facebook reach expand it but also just
being manav comments that I get and new
people that I have found I now have
friends that I've made in the yoga
community behind my books which is like
mind-blowing I have found like
connections with people who own the same
type of dog breed that I do I have a
vizsla and i'll post pictures of her and
i'll use the hashtags you know visual a
visual of isla pepe at cetera and I find
people to our villa owners as well and
they contact me and then I say like oh I
have a book out and I'll get messages
like oh my gosh I didn't know you were a
writer i just bought your book how cool
is that I'm like oh how cool is that so
you want to be a real person on social
media you want to show your readers and
you want to show new people like hey
this is what I'm interested in this is
what I do that sort of thing you don't
want to only
your book so that's a big piece of
advice and it truly really really like
turned around my social media efforts i
think when i started doing this so Jake
I agree love that is my other do's and
don'ts video I hope you guys enjoyed
this I hope you found some of it helpful
like I said in the beginning if you're
doing something that works for you and I
say something to like disclaim that if
it works for you keep making it work for
you we're all different our books are
different you just got to do what works
for you these are just my opinions my
suggestions my pieces of advice things
that I've seen work for me things that
I've seen work for other authors again
we're all different you do you if you're
doing good things do you please do
comment below if you have any other
dudes or domes or just pieces of advice
etc comment below and let us know
because like I said we're all different
and maybe something that I said won't
work for someone watching but if you
comment below maybe it would work for
them and then we can just all help each
other because I feel like that's such an
awesome thing that I belong to a
community that technically I guess we're
all competing with each other but I
don't feel like it ever feels that way
and I can very much say that honestly
because everyone wants to help everyone
wants to share everyone wants to give
their advice everyone wants to see each
other succeed because who doesn't want
to see book succeed I mean who doesn't
who doesn't want to see that right am i
right I think I'm right but I feel like
I've been talking forever I feel like
these author videos are always so long
but it's because I love books so much i
love my career i love what i do i love
the people i meet i love the books i
read it's just something that I have a
huge passion for I feel so grateful that
this is what I get to do every day is be
surrounded by books and the other lovely
authors and I get to come into contact
with on a daily basis I'm so
appreciative and usually overwhelmed
that this is my life but I hope you guys
found this video helpful if you do like
these other videos please do give this
one a thumbs up because it helps me out
knowing what you guys like to see if you
have any other ideas or suggestions that
you would want to see for the next
author video I try to do one usually
once a month but if you have anything
else or specific
