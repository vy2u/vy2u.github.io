channel so today's video is going to be
a little bit different it's going to be
just like a Q&amp;amp;A video but a
pre-established QA that makes sense and
so basically if you do not know I know I
do a lot of beauty on this channel but I
am also a published author I own a
publishing company and IM a book blogger
I also do a lot of freelance in the book
world marketing editing proofreading
things like that so I'm very much
immersed in the book world that is my
full-time job as being a publisher as
being an author and is working on my
book blog which is Chiclets plus and
then of course all the freelance work
does keep me very busy but in case you
did not know that or if you are new here
wanted to let you know what I do and
then I get to play with beauty and yoga
and other fun things in my spare time
but yeah being an author being in books
that is my full-time job but basically
what today's video is going to be the
publishing company that i own is called
marching inc i NK it's just a little
play on my name and one of my authors
with marching anchor name is Laura
Chapman she is also here on YouTube and
she helped me and asked if I would want
to do like a collab video with her we
each have six questions that were going
to answer pertaining to our writing our
author life our books that sort of thing
and I thought it was a really fun idea
and I'm really excited to be able to
like collab with her on something a
little bit out of the box something that
we've never done before together too so
I thought that was a really fun idea and
I was totally down for it so i will have
everything for laura linked in the
description box below her youtube the
video that she creates of course her
social media accounts she's everywhere
as well Facebook Twitter Instagram but
I'll leave that below as well and all
the links to her books also laura rights
chicklet and she writes phenomenal
chiclet I have talked about several her
books here on the channel like when she
has a book release I've talked about her
latest book releases here on YouTube and
just kind of going over each book but I
will leave all of her books plus the
links to purchase them in the
description box below I of course highly
suggest that you check lure out because
I love her books but yeah so we have
just six questions to answer i know i
can tend to ramble so i will try to make
this video as short as i can but yeah if
you would like to learn a little bit
more about me and my author life so
question one is how have you changed as
a writer and person since penning your
first novel and my debut novel is called
destined to fail i published it in 2011
i started writing it in two thousand
like late two thousand eight i believe
is when i started writing it and it's
very interesting because i think how i
changed as a writer is that I definitely
have more confidence I had zero
confidence going into publishing
destined to fail I didn't really talk a
lot about it with anybody I'm very I'm a
very private person when it comes to my
career and what it is that I do like
when I jumped on youtube I didn't tell
anybody about it except like my husband
knew because I would film videos in the
house and he would come home and I'd
like have full face of makeup on like
thursday at four o'clock and he's like
are you doing something tonight I'm like
no just filming videos in my office on
my phone no big deal but I'm very
private because I'm someone who's very
afraid of rejection I'm afraid of
negativity and I don't like it and so
when I would tell a few people like hey
I have this idea I want to write a book
the responses were like that's really
dumb why do you want to write a book
books don't go anywhere they don't do
anything like you can't have a career
writing books like that was kind of like
the responses that I would get from
people and it's very discouraging and
makes you not want to do it and when I
first started writing a book this is
before self-publishing really really was
out there this is before like the e-book
craze really really was out there and it
was hard to be an author I actually
wanted to go to school for like
journalism in English because I've
always loved writing it's what I've
always wanted to do but at the time when
I was getting ready to go to college
being an author too
me it was like making it in Hollywood
it's so hard no one's going to do it
like not only if you have to be
phenomenal what you do what you need to
like know the right connections and be
in the right place at the right time and
I'm like I just live in Iowa I'm not
going to go anywhere like how can I get
anywhere so see I'm starting to ramble
already started running destined to fail
I kept it very close to home I didn't
talk to a lot of people about it I did
create my blog chicklet Plus as a way to
help me gain those connections to meet
other people that were in the book world
that could maybe help me publish a novel
and starting chocolate plus i will say
like hands down is one of the best ideas
I've ever had ever it opened up so many
different doors for me it gave me so
many different opportunities and it
really let me create I really let me
explore my passion for books and I will
be eternally grateful for chiclet plus
for that reason but it really did it
help me connect with authors that I
could ask them questions I could ask
them referrals I I quickly realized that
writing a book I wanted to do it my way
I really wasn't interested in gaining an
agent and self-publishing was pretty new
but I'm not afraid of new things and I
knew that was what I wanted to do when I
was also very scared and so with
destined to fail I had I think like
three editors I mean I don't even know
how many proofreaders I went through I
had so many different beta readers and
it took me so long to actually publish
the book because I rewrote it three
times because with every feedback that I
got from someone and I had so much
feedback on that bug I would change the
book and change his book and change the
book because I thought someone's
feedback meant you know they were the
most important opinion ever so of course
I had to change the book to reflect what
they were saying and in some ways I'm
frustrated with myself that I did that
because destined to fail didn't
necessarily come out the way that I had
originally planned for it to come out
which is kind of frustrating to me and
now I have learned as a writer you do
need opinions you need an editor you
need proof reader you do need beta
readers but especially when it comes to
like beta readers which are Raiders that
will breed an early on draft and give
their feedback you need to take their
feedback and you need to listen to their
feedback but you also need to listen to
yourself and if you have too much
feedback it's just going to be a mess
you're going to have too many opinions
it's just going to be too hard so I
usually live myself to two or three beta
readers an editor a proofreader and
that's kind of where I stand and I've
had so much more confidence and being a
writer from when I publish destined to
fail from when I last published my last
book which was up to I do so there's
that how have I changed as a person well
I'm much older now just had a birthday
so there's that of in my personal life
I've also gotten married I was dating my
husband when I started writing destined
to fail we're now married but I'm just a
much happier person because I gave
myself a goal and that was to finish
Business School and if I was still
interested in pursuing writing once I
finished and got my bachelor's degree
then I would really go for it and that
is exactly what I did and I'm very proud
of myself and I'm just very happy with
my life too is if you could have a
writing retreat anywhere where would you
go and what would your daily schedule
look like so I am an absolutely travel
junkie and I mean it doesn't even have
to be like out of the country or
somewhere exotic like if someone's like
hey you want to go to Kansas City this
weekend I'm like yes i'm in i'll go like
i just love I just love going places
it's so much fun but if I could have a
writing retreat I'm really interested
right now and going to like Bali I don't
know why or Thailand that's really up
there are those good places for writing
retreats I don't really know but those
are like places that I'm eyeing but
honestly for a writing retreat I would
maybe say like London is that cliche I
don't know if that's cliche but maybe
London which you know is a place that I
want to go to anyways it's on like the
top of my list but I don't know I feel
like I hear so many writers going there
and like getting something like so
inspired and being able to be so
creative so maybe there because it maybe
I probably be worried if I went
we're like beachy that I would just like
lay on the beach all day and not
actually do any writing so maybe if I
went somewhere I could actually get
writing done and what would my daily
schedule look like for sure I would have
a schedule because I am i scheduled
person like I have to have a schedule
every single day or I'm just confused
and I will like throw my hands up in the
air and i'm not sure where I'm supposed
to go or where I'm supposed to be doing
but my schedule if it's a writing
retreat then I'm writing as much as i
can so i would probably say like in the
morning would be like breakfast and a
workout because I work out every morning
I need to work out I feel like it helps
me to like be creative and be more awake
and more energetic so that's why I
really like working out in the morning
and then write write write write write
probably break for lunch probably right
right right right right and then you
know doing something fun like doing
something touristy seeing something
being around people you know as a writer
you have to have voices in your head
being able to get voices in my head
seeing new places and then at night
probably right right right right right
lots of right if so writing retreat we
got a right right number three is when
people find out you're an author what is
the number one questions I asked and
what's your answer probably the most
common questions I get asked when I say
that I'm an author is what kind of books
you write and i will answer women's
fiction I've written women's fiction
I've written new adult and my latest one
was more on the chiclet side but another
like one of the most popular questions
that I get asked is oh is it like fifty
Shades of Grey and I'd like I truly I
don't know I hate that question I've
never read Fifty Shades of Grey I
haven't watched the movie I feel like a
lot of people in the literary world like
don't if you ask I feel like because
I've asked a lot of authors like have
you read 50 shades or have you watched
the movie and people are like no no so I
don't know that just that like weirds me
out I don't know that question is very
very popular I also sometimes it's not
the most common question or as popular
as the Fifty Shades question but I
actually get people ask a lot when I say
man out there that
oh so you have a lot of free time like
what else do you do and I'm like oh okay
no I don't have a lot of free time
people like what no it takes a lot of
time a lot of energy a lot of late
nights a lot of creativity a lot of time
to write a book I don't have a lot of
free time
the next question is what are some of
the biggest pressures you find when
writing and publishing a book some of
the biggest pressures that I feel now
when writing and publishing is is just
being worried that people are going to
like it and people are going to connect
with it in the way that I want them to
connect with a book if that makes any
sense at all but in all of the books
that I've written I feel like I have
tried to incorporate some sort of life
lessons that I have learned in my life
into my book because when I was growing
up I relied on books a lot to teach me a
lot of different things and you know not
everything and my past has been
fantastic and wonderful and great and I
turned two books a lot when I was going
through hard things to help you know
keep me on the right track but to help
me learn lessons and I learned a lot of
them through the books that I read and
so that's really what I want to have in
my books as well like I don't
necessarily always just want to write
like a happy story I want there to be
some sort of lesson that readers can
learn in there and there's been several
times in several books where people
completely and totally missed the point
of the story and they just like to pick
on other things and critique other
things and I get that when you put
something out into the world like that
especially a book like you're gonna have
backlash I will never understand how
authors get so upset when they get a bad
review it sucks I get it especially if
it doesn't make sense I literally like
one of my favorite reviews ever I think
it's on my book the green ticket it the
review on amazon says this book smells
like smelly cheese what does that mean
unlike did you order up paperback and it
legit smells like cheese did you put
cheese on the book like I don't I don't
understand how that is a review I don't
understand how Amazon let's that stay up
because clearly it's someone just being
jacked off so I don't know so I mean I
understand that but when people take the
time and give an honest critique review
and authors just like freak the F out
I'm like I don't understand not everyone
is going to like your book not
everyone's going to like your video
it's not everyone's going to like your
pictures like we all have different
opinions so like let's just calm down
about it but so I understand that not
everyone will like all of my books
especially because in quite a few of
them I go into more serious subjects
that I know not everyone is comfortable
reading I try to be very upfront with
that in my blurbs and let people know
that my third book is called a question
about friendship and there's really not
a happy ending and I say that in the
blur because I know some people read
books because they want a happy ending
and I say it right there there's not a
happy ending in the cards for everyone
and I remember getting a review and this
reviewer was so mad because there wasn't
a happy ending I'm like I told you I I
tried to warn you it's right there it
says it so don't mad at me but that is a
very big pressure is just you know how
the book will be received how people
will will talk about it and that sort of
thing and for me that's probably one of
the biggest pressures because being an
author we do rely on the review so much
and we rely on readers to keep buying
our books or else how would we be able
to stay in business question is what
gave you the confidence to decide to
publish your first novel and I kind of
talked about this about how that was
like one of my biggest things publishing
my first book is not having a lot of
confidence and I don't know honestly
like I don't know what was the trigger
that made me be like no I can do this
like I can do this why am i holding back
why do I keep rewriting the story why do
I keep holding on to it like you just
need to go for it and I surely don't
remember i don't--there's not like a
lightbulb moment and I'm sure it was
just I'm sure it was just something in
me saying like if you don't go for it
you're never gonna go for it like you
just need to do it and it's funny
because I feel the same way about
YouTube I wanted to do youtube for a
very long time I actually started
YouTube probably four years ago or so i
had a channel and i put a few videos out
there and I just I didn't really like
them I didn't share it with anybody but
I didn't really like the videos um the
very few p
well that I did share it with like what
my social media was still pretty small
like they're just really wasn't a
response on it and I gave up very
quickly and I've always been pretty
upset with myself that I did that
because even if something doesn't seem
to be working great right away the
response shouldn't be to just give up
you know it just should make you want to
work harder or so I am a little
frustrated at myself that I did that and
of course I'm frustrated with how long
it took me to put out destined to fail
but at the same time I do believe that
everything happens and happens for a
reason and it happens in that time that
it should so to me I'm actually I am
glad that the version of destined to
fail that came out I'm glad it was that
version and especially not the first
version that i wrote because i've looked
back and I read that first version and I
just thought there's no way I would want
that published it was very much it was
just too much of my own story and I
don't want that out there in the way
that it was written so I'm glad that I
did wait and I did rewrite and that sort
of thing so I mean I don't know does
that make any sense I'm just just going
off in my own little world here but what
gave you the confidence to publish your
first novel is just something inside me
saying if you don't go for it now you're
never going to go for it just go for it
this question is do you have a book
favorite out of all that you've
published and i feel like i do and i
don't know if that's a bad thing i don't
know if it's about if your books are
supposed to be like your children like
you can't pick a favorite but i think
that i do have a favorite and i think it
would have to be my third book a
questionable friendship because in this
book this is my most creative book and
when i say that doesn't feel is slightly
based on my life and my past the green
ticket is based on an experience that i
had in college that I just thought was
so insane that I remember going through
this experience and being like why is
this happening to me like why am I here
and how did I get here and then a few
years later I'm like I was putting on
situation to freaking write a book about
it because that was just two wilde not
to write a book about it
and the fourth book is about a girl
getting married I started writing it
around the time that I got engaged and
it just follows like that book was
supposed to be much more like
light-hearted and fun about you know
planning a wedding going through a
wedding but also a special relationship
between a girl and her grandma I lost my
grandma a few years back and we did have
a special relationship and I wanted to
write some sort of like tribute
dedication to her but a questionable
friendship was one that I felt that I
was the most creative on I really had
nothing to base these experiences on
it's about friendship between two women
that turns out to be very questionable
if you can't tell from the title and
actually what was so so strange about
that book is I wrote it without like
I've had friends I have had falling out
and I've had fights with friends but
nothing that like shook me to my core
like how in this book happened and I
really had to like channel of emotions
and really use my imagination to put
these characters in these situations and
then it was you know probably like a
year after this book published I
actually went through that I actually
lost my best friend for reasons that are
still unbeknownst to be um she just
literally stopped talking to me one day
and every time I try to communicate with
her she just says no it's very odd but I
actually lost a friendship that really
made me question our entire seven year
friendship because I'm like how do you
cut a best friend out of your life with
no remorse with no explanation with no
anything like how was our friendship
ever as strong as I thought it was did
she ever take me as seriously as I took
her like what happened and I remember
around that time re reading the book
again rereading a questionable
friendship for myself and seeing a lot
of my emotions that I was going through
in that book and I'm like well I mean I
guess that means I did a right job
because because now going through a
questionable friendship my situation
like eerily mirrored what happened here
and
like not like the situation's were we're
the same because if you've read that
book like everyone is still alive and
well so don't worry about that but just
the emotions and the feelings that these
characters went through very similarly
reflected my life and I just thought
that was very crazy so yeah that was
very weird that was that was that was
very weird and so a lot of times people
ask me like was a fashionable friendship
based on you and this girl is friendship
and I'm like no that book was written a
year before anything happened it was
published probably at least eight months
before anything happened like it had
nothing to do with it but yeah but it's
still probably my favorite book for the
reason that when I was writing it and
going through it I was I felt like I was
being able to be my most creative self
it was also the first book that was set
not in the Midwest my first two books
were based in Iowa and the third book is
based in Maine and so I was able to do a
lot of different research and it was
just a lot of fun to learn about a state
that I've never been to I've never
visited so on all outlets I felt like I
was able to be my most creative and that
was really fun to write i will say i do
think book five is going to replace that
very soon and i think this one is going
to be my new favorite because I out the
novel in November during the National
Novel Writing Month and i just recently
revisited and reread it and like was
getting goosebumps and was crying and it
really like stirred me emotionally and
so I think this one book 5 i'm really
excited i think it'll be a summer
