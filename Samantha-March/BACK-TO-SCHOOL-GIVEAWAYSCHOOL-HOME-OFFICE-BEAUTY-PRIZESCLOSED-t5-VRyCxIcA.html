I'm really excited for today's video
because it's going to be a
back-to-school type of giveaway and this
is one that when I first saw the
back-to-school giveaway videos popping
up I wasn't even watching them because
I'm like well I'm not going back to
school so if I wanted to give away like
what would I do with school supplies
like besides give them away and I
finally started watching some and I was
like oh okay so it's not just school
supplies like some are some are solely
school supplies but some had like makeup
in it and fun things like that and I was
like okay maybe I could take it and put
my own type of spin on it and then I
still wasn't sure because I'm like I
feel like my audiences may be a little
bit older I don't feel like I have a ton
of younger viewers I know that I have
some because I see the comments but I
was like I don't I still don't know if
this makes sense to me
so last night it's an I perform filling
this video I said something on my
snapchat was like will you guys
screenshot this if you want to see it
back to school giveaway and kind of
talked about it I I think that was the
most screenshotted snap that I've ever
had and I asked for screenshots and like
opinions and feedbacks about videos so
often and I mean within minutes there
was so many I was like oh okay well I
was not expecting that
and then I went on that I was like okay
I feel like you guys are really excited
for this one like would you guys have
any ideas of what you'd want me to get
and once again so many snaps came in of
ideas and suggestions and I was like
okay people actually feel like you want
this I gotta get on it and so literally
this morning like as I'm filming this I
woke up and I was at Target at like 8:30
they opened at 8 o'clock I was there at
8:30 I was ready to go
stroll through the aisles picking out
giveaway prizes like I was like I'm not
even gonna order anything online and
wait for it I'm filming this video today
because my snapchat came through and
told me that you guys wanted this so I'm
really excited like I said I put my own
spin on it I have school supplies I have
like things for around the house or even
like dorm life and then I do have like
makeup Beauty hair products as well so
it's kind of like a mixture of a lot of
different things but hopefully you guys
like it
you know anyone can enter this giveaway
if you are going to school if you're
going to college if you're a mom that
has a kid going to college if your mom
going back to college I hope these are
helpful items for you I you know I don't
think every single item of anybody could
use like if I were to win I don't know
what I would do with a backpack like I
don't necessarily need one but I have
four nieces like I'm sure I'd be able to
find someone who would need a backpack
like same thing with school supplies but
I was trying to think when I was doing
the school supplies like what could be
good for like a home office or even to
take to your work or things like that so
I tried to incorporate it the way that I
would want to see it like I wanted to
make a video that if I were watching it
I'd be like excited to win it you know
what I mean like that's and that's kind
of how I try to gear all my videos this
things that I really enjoy doing are
things that I like singing or whatever
that was kind of my thought process I'm
gonna stroll through Target at 8:30 in
the mornings the dough is so long I'm so
sorry but I'm gonna hop in and show you
guys all of the prizes and then at the
end I'll explain how to get entered and
all that good stuff so let's hop in and
see what you can win categories the more
like traditional school supply some home
and dorm life and then some makeup and
beauty products so I hope you guys like
this video I was really appreciative of
the snaps and ideas that came in like I
think probably the the most snapped to
me was when it came to makeup products
and it was like you know we want more
natural stuff maybe more affordable
stuff and I was like actually that's
perfect because really I'm going to
target picking stuff up like I don't
even really have time to go to Sephora
or Ulta or place an online order so the
majority of things that I have are from
Target a few things that I did have
around the house that I had planned for
like future giveaways as well but most
of this is coming from Target and you
know it's more affordable also like more
natural products you know people are
like I don't really want to see like a
purple or a blue lipstick and someone
was like how about you know if you get
lip sticks how about doing all nudes and
I just thought these suggestions were so
great so I really tried to take
everything that was being said into
consideration also I have you know the
three different categories that I talked
about and there's you know a handful of
items in each cow
Gouri it's not a huge makeup giveaway
and that's mostly because I always do
makeup giveaways you know I have to make
up giveaways running right now I have a
very large makeup beauty giveaway
planned for 5000 subscribers so I didn't
want this to be too focused on makeup
like I didn't want it to be like makeup
overload because get that from me in the
future you've gotten from me in the past
and so I just wanted to make this one a
little bit different and hopefully
exciting if the first time we'll go
through the school supplies and the
first thing that I had to get of course
was a backpack so this is the book bag
that I picked out it is from Target so
it's from sport I'm not gonna lie I know
absolutely zero about book bags I
haven't carried one in quite some times
what I went with it looks like it has
like one big compartment here and has a
couple smaller compartments here and
then it has like the pockets on the
sides for like drinks or lipgloss okay
whatever you want to put on it but so
the winner will be receiving this and my
plan is to probably like put everything
inside of the book bag when I ship it to
you so when your package comes and
you're like oh she just sent me the book
bag like open it up I'm just gonna try
to fit everything inside if I can and
then ship it that way but yeah I thought
that was really cute and of course if
you don't need a book bag you can always
give it away to a daughter and niece a
friend anything like that but honestly
my husband like when we travel and we're
not going away for like a really long
time or anything like that he still
takes his book bag from college like
that's what he takes those like his
duffel bag so I mean you can use it that
way too but yes here's the book bag you
more supplies in here I got these
pencils these are what they look like I
just thought they were super cute
because they're like wood it says six
pack of wood pencils dipped I just
thought they were cute like they have
the little colors at the end I did look
the lead is like regular pencils so it's
not like any different colors or
anything but I just thought they were
cute I love cute things also gonna put
some post-its in there I'm such a
post-it freak I like I always have 20
million post-its around my computer so I
got some orange post-its here this is
just a good ol pencil eraser because you
know we make mistakes so here's an
eraser a couple pink highlighters for
you these are my favorite
I always have highlighters on hand as
well so here's two pink ones
um this is sixty paperclips and I just
thought this was like super cute as well
so I got this mesh Cup and now I'm
actually kind of mad that I didn't get
one for myself because I think this is
super cute so this is what it looks like
so again take you to school you can put
it on your desk at home and take it'll
work like put pens in it paper clips
whatever it is that you want to put in
it but ah yeah I wish I got one for
myself
and also got some regular old like
scotch tape invisible tape always need
tape I also got some notepads it's a 60
sheet list pad it looks like this I just
thought it was super cute again pretty
girly got a bunch of pens these are like
my favorite pens
I know like these are like like the
cheap pens but honestly like the more
expensive pens
I feel like suck like I am all about
more inexpensive pens I feel like they
last longer and they write better so
those are the ones I picked up from you
because they happen to be my favorite I
also got this planner it says it's a
weekly monthly student planner it's July
2016 all the way through June 2017
there's weekly and monthly calendars a
yearly overview a place for class
schedules student resource info and note
pages so this is what it looks like so I
just thought it was really cute with the
pink and the orange and then kind of
like what the inside looks like well
everybody needs a notebook I mean this
is a fear a student you're going to
college just for work you're a writer
like me like I have so many notebooks in
and around my house it's kind of
ridiculous so this one I just thought
was cute it is pink as well even has
like a little pocket inside here like
this little pocket if you have any notes
that you want to put in there but you'll
get this UB notebook as well it is like
you were like super cute colors and
designs but this is some index dividers
so you'll be getting some of those as
well there is coming here there's eight
in here and they include label stickers
I picked up a pocket folder honestly I
still use these around my home office as
well everybody needs a binder again a
binder is what I use all the time still
in my home office so for school for work
whatever it is I picked up this cute
pink binder from UB as well on the front
it says UVA
one for you one for me Oh for every
forever you be item you purchase a you
be item will be donated to a classroom
in need right here in the US though it's
really cool I didn't know that until
right now but that's so cool so yeah how
many UB items so I purchased like four
that's so cool so those were the school
supplies you'll be getting now I'm gonna
move on to like home / dorm life type of
thing again these are like such a random
assortment of products but here we go
so first up I got a loofah for your
shower or your bath mostly because I
needed a new one so I picked one up for
you guys as well I also picked up some
chip clips this was one thing when I
went to college I remember being
completely stressed out on that shopping
trip before going to school and like
everything that you had to buy or like
we forgot chip clips and within like
three days I had to go back to Walmart
and be like who forgets chip clips also
very handy in the kitchen is like
measuring cups so these come I think
from like a cup and then all the way up
to like a half teaspoon but it's like a
pretty good good size set of measuring
cups and then I also have this hairband
like hair tie thing I won't put it in my
actual hair but this is from a bomb
apparel and they sent it to me but I
don't really wear these ever so I
haven't actually in a giveaway pile and
it wasn't really sure what giveaway I
was gonna put it into and I thought why
not this one included a deck of playing
cards and I know that might seem super
random but like I love playing cards and
especially for going to college you're
gonna need some playing cards but even
as an adult like legit me and my husband
will like play card games together or
like when we travel around a plane
anything like that like we still play
cards so I have this deck of cards in
here and I also included some Purell
hand sanitizer hello yes I also ran out
of some for my first so I got me some
but it has this like contraption on here
where you can actually like stick it
around like your purse handles or your
backpack handle or things like that so
it's like super handy I also have this
bracelet it is from pura-vida bracelets
I used to have I don't know if anyone
else is noticed but I used to have like
20 bracelets on each wrist I
decided to take them off it's been about
two years since I've had them on so I
recently decided to take quite a few off
and I'm just left with this but this one
here with the arrow is actually a
pura-vida bracelet as well and so I
actually have quite a few because I do
work with them as an affiliate but this
is a brand new one and you should be
able to tell because it's like super
bright and also they're like really
tacky when you first get them but I'm
gonna include this one in here as well I
just I enjoy pura-vida bracelets I have
so many of them and I bought them all
even before I started working with them
and I just really like them as a brand I
think they do cool things
so I also send you guys a peer reviewed
uh bracelet as well the other item I
have is a laundry bag and this is what
it looks like but this is what I used in
college so much we did have like washers
and dryers on our campus I had a little
bit of a different college experience I
didn't stay in a dorm we had we actually
had a permanent cycle living at the
college that we went to and so you know
we had an apartment we had stoves we had
fridges we had bathrooms in our
apartment so it was really cool but we
were all on campus but we did have
laundry facilities as well but I was on
the fifth floor and they were on the
first floor and so I just would always
put everything into like this was like
my hamper like my dirty clothes went
into my bag and then I would just pick
up my bag and take it down to the
laundry room and it was really quite
handy if received in an Influenster box
and I used to wear these like all the
time yeah and I actually have some like
I have like old ones but I'm probably
not gonna use these myself so I thought
I'd throw them in the giveaway as well
but they are foot pedals give them the
boot this is what it looks like looks
like this so basically you just put it
like inside your shoes and it's supposed
to be like more comfortable so
especially if you're like going off to
college and somewhere where you have to
walk a lot or walk to classes quite a
bit especially in the wintertime where
you can like put them in your boots and
stuff it can make them a lot more
comfortable yeah also I got so many
snaps about this because I shared like a
sneak peak on my snapchat and so many
people are like yes I see those but like
yeah tampons hello especially if you're
going to a dorm room
I always think was really handy to have
like a little basket of like feminine
products because you don't always all
coming over to your place and your
and they might need some help sometimes
so it's pretty handy to have these
around so tampons I also have some body
lotion I'm a huge fan of lotion and is
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it's the vanilla
bean Noel lotion so obviously it's like
a holiday lotion I bought it at the
holiday time and I just haven't gotten
around to it yet because I'm too busy
trying to use up all my other lotions
and I was like well not using it myself
I'm gonna put it into a giveaway and
then I'm gonna move on to some like hair
makeup beauty products so first I'm
gonna send you this epsy bag this was my
last epsy bag that I received and
they're just really nice like little
makeup bags but I have so many of these
from Ipsy that I actually have like been
given the bags away like every single
month in a giveaway and so I thought I
would give you this empty bag so they'll
have a nice little makeup bag this is
good especially if you need to like go
into like a shared bathroom at a dorm
which serves like the weirdest thing to
me I'm so grateful we had our own
bathrooms but you need to take a little
bit of makeup products with you that
these are a good option so I picked up
some of these yes to hypo-allergenic
facial wipes these are the cucumber once
I actually have them myself I have a
little guy right here and I love them so
I picked up the big eye for use we have
30 wipes in them seriously if you're in
college and you go out please don't
sleep in your makeup just put put the
white spray by your bed put them by your
bed and you have no excuse when you lay
down just cheat cheat cheat and your
skin will thank you so I'm also gonna
put in here this Shea Moisture fusion
coconut water weightless cream rinse I
think I actually got this in my target
beauty box but I just have so many
haircare products like there's just no
way I can go through them all so this
was in an influencer box but it's a
shampoo and conditioner from Pantene
it's their intense hydration so it looks
like this I actually received this in
both an Influenster box and a target
beauty box as well so I have doubles of
them so you guys can have this as well
and I like the little travel sizes again
if you are doing like dorm style living
you can carry the little travel sizes
into the bathrooms with you or even if
you're not going to school these are
good for travel as well or like a guest
shower bathroom it's good stuff so I'm
going to include some nails in here I
don't
my nails on right now which is a truly
sad really sad I need to put them back
on but I do a lot of my fake nails now
from nail her and I have a whole video
about it and I actually do work with
nail her but I love them I plan on
having a set of nails in the 5k giveaway
which I'm really excited for but these
were the nails that I wore before I
found nail her I think they are good I
do not think they're as good as nailed
her but if you are like new to the fake
nail game or you just needs like a night
with good looking nails I do recommend
these because this is what I did wear
before it nail her but they are from
impress and it's a press-on manicure and
if you can see it's actually like matte
nails and then you have like some
glitter shiny Nails too as well so I was
really excited for these and I didn't
get the chance to use them because I
found nail her before I was able to put
these on but you will get a set of fake
nails as well I also picked up some of
these basic cotton rounds this is what I
use to like clean my face if I'm using
like a cleanser and foliate or things
like that I don't want to use my fingers
I used these cotton rounds and honestly
I need it more so I picked them up for
myself and then I picked them up for you
guys as well I just always have them
next to my sink in my bathroom and yeah
use them pretty much every night so
you'll get 100 of these I also picked up
a mini brush set - this is from up and
up the Target brand but I've been
hearing good things about their brushes
and I really want to get me a set but
this is a mini brush set it has a
foundation a concealer and a shadow
brush so it looks like this so again
this can be good to travel with or like
if you're in college life and you just
need like something on the go or you
need to like get ready in class because
I've done that before you can have these
mini brushes and just like throw them in
your bag with you I'm from Rimmel I
picked up their nude scandal eyes it's a
Kohl eyeliner I really like Rimmel's
nude liners I have some myself and then
for mascara I got this one from what in
awhile it's the volume ups mascara is
maybe what it's called so here is that
so they'll picked up a nude lipstick
from Maybelline it's in the shade
daringly nude it's one of their matte
formulas which I love their matte
formulas I don't have daringly nude
myself but like I said a lot of people
mentioned like nudes lapies and so
that's what I went with
so to get this Maybelline lipstick
Maybelline lipsticks are like my
favorites and I love their mess as well
another nude lipstick that I got is from
NYX
it's one of their lingerie liquid
lipsticks and ruffle trim I actually
have this one myself and I absolutely
love it I talk about it all the time
about how it's one of like my favorite
favorite nudes also from covergirl I
picked up this eye palette because I've
been super curious about them myself but
I've never gotten one for me but it's
their true Naked palette and it's like
the golden one so I thought this would
be really pretty and it would be really
good for like you can do like a simple
look with it and neutral look and
everyday look with but it also has some
darker ones over here if you wanted to
do like a darker smokey eye you have
that option too alright guys that is
