today's video is going to be a
back-to-school makeup tutorial or if
you're not going back to school I think
the other thing that I can call this is
like my quick and easy ten-minute makeup
routine because typically with
back-to-school looks for focusing on
quick and easy to do in the morning if
you sleep in and you're gonna be late
for school super excited to do this
video let me know if you have any other
back-to-school of videos that you would
like to see I've seen some hair
tutorials being requested so I have that
on my list but let me know if there's
anything else back-to-school that you
would like to see my back-to-school
giveaway is still going on right now so
that will be linked it down below if
you'd like to see my back to school
makeup look / quick and easy ten minute
makeup tutorial why don't we go ahead
and get started the first I'm gonna do
like normal let's put my ears on so a
lot of times when I do my makeup looks I
start with the eyes and then I do the
face and then the eyes and such but when
I do like my quick and easy makeup looks
I typically just start with the face
because I don't do a lot of eye shadows
or a lot of liner or lashes or things
where I'm like touching my face or
worrying about fallout so that I
wouldn't want to do my face first what
these quick and easy looks I just go
ahead and start with the face so we are
nice and zoomed in welcome to my face so
the first thing that I'm going to do is
prime of course this is the number seven
airbrush away primer or seven is
drugstore affordable can find them at
Ulta also I don't have everything in
here drugstore and I'll kind of explain
my reasoning for a why but I know a lot
of people do like drugstore only
back-to-school tutorials but since I
kind of wanted to make this
back-to-school a slash my ten minute
routine I kind of want to show you what
my ten minute routine is and this is
like pretty spot-on to what I do when I
am in a hurry and just want to do a
quick quick little something with my
makeup so for a foundation I'm going to
use the covergirl vitalist healthy
elixir foundation I'm in the shade 740
which is natural beige and I'm just
gonna do a few pumps onto my Mota
prismatic
ruch here I do like this brush for a
foundation and again this one is an
affordable brush crazy to think of
school starting again so for anybody who
is starting school no matter what grade
or college our continuing education just
good luck on your school year I hope it
is fantastic this brush because it's so
big it's just so quick and fast to blend
out your foundation so that is nice and
simple I really do like this covergirl
foundation too I find it to be very
long-lasting which is good for you know
all day at school then for concealer a
lot of times like when I first wake up
in the morning and then I have to go do
something like school this is the
concealer that I love reaching for its
from Maybelline it's the instant age
rewind this is such a good concealer for
like hiding dark circles or hiding like
you're tired puffy eyes I recommend this
one a lot and I mean you can see that
this one's almost gone as well and this
is not the first second or third bottle
that I have of this stuff so I'm just
gonna go ahead and place this on the
under eyes I'm also going to put some on
my eyelids to act as my eye shadow
primer when I get there and then just
some down the center of my face
sometimes I skip that step and just do
underneath my eyes but this concealer is
a bit lighter for me so when I'm using
it I typically like to balance out the
rest of my face since it's quite too
light and then this is one of the new
Sigma dimensional brushes this is the 4
d HD kabuki you can tell that I've
already been loving on it I've just got
it impure like a week ago but I really
have been loving on it for concealer
because of this pointed tip it can just
get right up in there underneath your
eyes of course you do want to set the
concealer so it stays all day I'm just
gonna use my Rimmel translucent stay
matte powder and then this is my ELF
small tapered brush
I think this brush is like $1 or $2 or
something I just got it at Target so I'm
not gonna bake because I don't really
bake a ton anyways but nobody has time
to bake in the morning so then for my
eyes and then
also when I finish off my face I'm gonna
use these pure vanity pallets they are
in gold digger and then also in
dreamchaser I mentioned these recently I
think goes on the brands that I'm loyal
to and I was saying how I feel like
these are really underrated pallets and
not a lot of people talk about them but
when I'm going for like my quick and
easy simple makeup I'm reaching for both
of these pallets because I like that
they have everything inside that I need
so in the gold digger palette I love the
bronzer blush and highlight shade like I
love all three of them and it's super
easy and handy I just go in here I have
those three I have a large mirror it's
super nice and then in The Dream Chaser
palette I love all four of these
eyeshadows over here like they're some
of my favorite neutral Browns you know
when I'm in a hurry I'm going for what I
know and that's my neutral brown
eyeshadows but that's just how it is so
these are the pellets that I reach for a
lot I travel with them and they're just
kind of what I go with so I know that
they aren't drugstore affordable you can
find pure at Ulta but if I'm also doing
my quick and easy 10-minute makeup
tutorial these are what I am reaching
for and I think it's super cute how the
mere pops up like that these are what
I've been reaching for the most so I
still wanted to use them in this
tutorial but of course I mean I'm just
using brown eyeshadows so I'm sure you
have some brown eyeshadows in there so
for the eyes I like to keep it really
simple so this one is the dream chaser
palette and I'm first gonna go into this
shade right here using my morphe g24
it's just a big big fluffy crease brush
and then I'm just going to swipe this in
the crease and nothing about what I do
with my eyes is like any sort of precise
or time-consuming or really anything
like that they another reason why I love
these palettes so much is because
they're just really easy to bring along
so instead of you know having to bring
along my bronzer and then my blush and
then my highlight and then my different
eyeshadows they're all just in these
palettes and so they're really easy to
throw in your bag I travel with these a
ton too so if you want to bring
your makeup to school for any touch-ups
throughout the day I just think it's
easier to bring one or two items versus
having to bring all of your individual
products you know then I'm gonna grab
out my Sigma e25 and I'm gonna dip into
the darker shade that's right below the
first shade that we used and I'm just
going to press this on to the outer V of
my eye and then slowly start to blend it
in and I'm not really making sure this
is like precise or anything the only
thing that I want to make sure it is is
blend it nicely and I'm gonna take this
like creamy white shade up here and then
this is a brush from Real Techniques it
is essential crease brush and I'm just
going to pop that lighter shade on the
inner part of my eye I'm gonna go back
with my e 25 and blend that for my brows
I'm going to use the benefit goof proof
pencil I feel like this is one of like
the fastest ways that I can do my brow
so if I'm in a hurry I typically am
reaching for my goof proof pencils and
try to fill in my brows as quickly as I
can so I just start at the base of my
brow and then start to line the bottom
to create a shape I typically fill in
the tail right away and then I just come
back and start to fill in any sparse
areas but in the front on this brow I
have quite a few sparse areas and then
for the beginning of my brow what I do
is I just kind of flip my pencil up and
I try to create those hair like strokes
and then when I feel like I'm getting
somewhere I'll flip it over and kind of
spoolie everything out I come back and
see where I need to fill in some more
which is usually here at the beginning
of my brow and then when I think I'm
done I just spoolie through it again
until I think it looks pretty good what
I'm doing like quick eye
try to just do a really natural brow I
don't really know how to shape brows
anyways so I basically just concentrate
on filling in any sparse areas working a
bit on the front here and then just
making sure you know I have like
somewhat of a tail that's what I do when
I'm trying to be really fast with brows
because otherwise like it could take me
a really long time and I like the GU
first pencil for it I feel like it's
pretty just fast and easy to use and
then once the brows are all filled and
I'm gonna just gonna go ahead and set
them so they stay in place this is the
Ready Set brow from benefit once the
eyebrows are done I'm gonna finish off
the eyes here I'm gonna use a nude
eyeliner so this is from Rimmel I think
it's called in the nude yeah in the nude
so I like to use a nude or like a beige
eyeliner in the mornings when I have to
like get up and go somewhere because it
kind of helps brighten the eyes and
makes them look a little bit more awake
and the Rimmel liners are really good
and they're also really affordable I'm
gonna go ahead and add this to my
waterline I'm gonna put just a little
bit of that first shade that we use on
my Sigma e25
and just run it real quickly underneath
my lower lash line again not worrying
about being any sort of precise or
whatnot so I'm just going to run it
under there and then kind of bring it
out a little bit as well because I'm not
going to be doing any liner or you know
I don't do a winged liner ain't nobody
got time for that in the morning so I'm
just gonna kind of sweep it out pass my
outer V as well again I'm going to come
back with that Real Techniques brush and
I'm going to grab out this white shade
again and I'm just going to put some
right on that inner corner of my eye and
then I'm also going to put some just
underneath the brow bone this is totally
a step you can skip it's just one that
I've really been liking lately and it
takes you know two seconds to do it's
not real precise either so it just kind
of helps brighten everything up and
helps you look more awake that's what I
think could now do lashes when I'm in
are
I have been putting on false lashes for
years and I have some days where it
takes me
47 seconds to pop a lash on and then I
have days that it takes me five minutes
and I'm having to take them off and
reapply takes a while to let your
enemies that get sticky so when I'm in a
hurry I'm not dealing with lashes so I'm
gonna come in with one of my favorite
drugstore mascaras this is the
Maybelline lash sensational I put my
ears back on I've been having to wait I
have the sony a 5100 which it's so
frustrating because it overheats so much
so especially when you're sitting down
you just want to do a tutorial and get
it all done with I always have to wait
always I feel like I have to say this in
every tutorial but I still get comments
on it and it's still something that
really really bothers me but so like I
said I have two sony a 5100 I really do
think it's a really good beginner camera
one thing that kind of bothers me as
well that honestly I don't know if it is
a true thing because I don't see it and
a lot of people say they don't see it
and no one started attacking me over
this until when Goss put out a video
saying all beauty bloggers use filters
but I get told a lot like why do you use
the filter your videos are so filtered
it's ridiculous and I'm like dude you
understand technology at all I don't
know I wouldn't even know how to use a
filter
I don't filter when I edit I don't color
correct when I edit my videos I don't
know how to do any of that and I'm not
interested in learning so I get really
frustrated but some people have said
that the sony a 5100 like it just has it
kind of built into it and it's not
anything that you can turn off like
there's a skin softening feature for
when you take photos but there's nothing
on there for videos and I always have it
turned off so it shouldn't even be a
thing anyways but I just get really
frustrated and I was actually watching
kathleenlights just like two weeks ago
and she made a comment about she was
having to film on her vlogging camera
and I was I thought for sure she said it
was the sony a 5100 but I usually don't
like to use this one because of the skin
softener and I'm like so it is just a
part of the camera so I don't know but
honestly I just would never use a filter
in something like tutorials like if it
was something I could turn off I would
turn it off because I just don't get it
but to be honest I also just don't care
like I'm that person on snapchat that
barely uses the filters to cover my bad
scanner to cover my breakouts because I
don't care I also in 30 years old like
I'm not out trying to convince people I
have perfect skin I'm not interested in
having filtered videos like that's just
not who I am I really hope one day to be
able to upgrade the Sony camera so I
don't have to deal with stuff like that
but also I have this camera for one year
and nobody nobody told me I use the
filter on my video until when Goss put
out that video nobody tell me that so I
was like and a lot of my videos you can
see the redness on my skin you can see
breakouts you can see pores you can see
texture so I'm like if I had a filter
button I'd be filtering that out I take
care of my skin and I'm very proud of
that so when people say I have a good
skin I'm not like oh it's cousins my
felt there but I just feel like I have
to address it especially when I do
tutorials because it just really bothers
me when I started researching when I
started saying it on snapchat people are
like it's just the camera it's something
in there that you can't turn off
I was ranting so then my camera
overheated of course but I just did two
coats of the Maybelline mascara and then
that's all I'm doing for my eyes so then
I'm gonna come into the gold-digger
pellet and I'm gonna grab out to the
bronzer shade and this is a modem
metallic brush it is the buffer brush so
I'm just gonna grab some of that bronzer
and go ahead and bronze up the face I do
love contour I love cream contour and
powder contour the days when I am in a
hurry
I just bronze and I skip over the
contour I do some bronzer on the
forehead as well then I'm gonna grab my
morphe e4 and come into the blush and
you have to use a really light hand
that's why I like to use my e4 cuz it's
kind of fluffy because this blush is a
very very pigmented and you need a very
light hand
it for highlight I'm gonna grab my
favorite highlighting brush with just
the stigma fl3 and come into this
highlight here like this and this
highlight is breaking the bomb it is
insane when I'm doing like these quick
and easy makeup looks I like to do the
eyes really simple and then just use a
really nice foundation like gives you a
really nice finish you know do a bit of
bronze put some color on my cheeks but
then come in with a really amazing
highlight to just give my skin a nice
dewy almost like wet look like isn't
that what that how that looks like mmm I
just love it so this is kind of my go-to
10 minute routine you don't have to use
a highlight that's intense if you don't
want to blind your fellow classmates but
you know man I just this is what I love
for my lip color I grabbed out a
Maybelline lipstick I do love these
lipsticks they're drugstore and I
grabbed out the shade peach buff which
is part of their matte line more of kind
of like a frosty pink which I do like
but I don't know if it's almost like too
frosty on me so one thing I've been
doing a lot lately is this is the mac
lipglass and candy box it's just a
really nice lip gloss but I've been
using it if I try a lip color and I
don't think it's like totally meshing
with me I just put on some of the squash
I feel like I like that more yeah I like
that combo the lipstick now is the
Maybelline peach buff and then the Mac
candy box and I like the way that that
turned out so then the final step I'm
going to do to lock everything in place
is a spray my face with the pixi glow
mist I do love this glow mists and it
does help make you glow obviously
because it's a glow mist so I'm just
gonna go ahead and spray this for our
final step you sanidine
with my to-do-list anybody else up to do
list all around their house cuz I do so
once my
is sprayed then this is going to be the
final look for my back to school makeup
