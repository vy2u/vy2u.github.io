is going to be a back-to-school up
makeup tutorial on this look right here
so this is quick this is easy this is
affordable breezing all affordable
products here and portable brushes and
again we're focusing on making it quick
and easy for when you need to wake up
and get ready and get out the door fast
this back to school makeup look was very
requested so I hope you like what I came
up with it is you know a pretty simple
like neutral look if you want something
with a little bit more a little bit more
glam I did recently do a full face
affordable glam tutorial and that was
using all affordable products as well
because I know when it comes to like
back to school a lot of the requests
that come in are saying like affordable
or drugstore or you know more
inexpensive type of products so I do
have that running as well so I can leave
that link down below for maybe like
picture day or something like that but
this one is just going to be a more
neutral look but I really hope that you
like how this look it came out and if
you would like to see how I Chi did
please keep watching the first thing I'm
going to do is come in with some BB
cream this is from Maybelline it's our
dream fresh eight and one beauty balm
skin Perfector I absolutely love it's
really light on the skin but evens
everything out I kind of think of the BB
cream as like a primer as well because
it is the eight and one it's doing so
many things like the primer can do and
when it comes to like back to school or
really like quick makeup looks I
typically will skip a primer I'm going
for like long lasting looks definitely
don't skip your primer but when it comes
to something just quick and easy and
fast I will just go in right away is
typically will use my fingers when it
comes to the BB cream but I'll take it
down on my neck as well as make sure and
covering all the areas i think that i do
like to do typically over my BB cream to
give me just a little bit more coverage
but still feel really like
weight is coming with a powder and i
actually just picked up this new product
from maybelline it's their Super say
better skin skin transforming powder so
this is what it looks like I picked up
the shade 30 which is warm nude I have
no idea that's going to be my shade and
I have not tried this out yet all so
we're going to go ahead and try it so
this is what it looks like so it has a
mere up here which is really cool then
here's the actual powder and then it
also comes with like a little sponge
guide to I'm not going to use the sponge
jets in there because I just got this
little set from Real Techniques it's
their ultimate base set and it comes
with like a powder brush a concealer
brush and then also the beauty sponge as
well so I want to use this so I'm going
to open this guy up that is actually
really cool as well because it comes
with this little case too so you can put
your brushes in it and it has a mirror
so that's pretty neat to UM I actually
got this set from actally i think is how
you say the website if you are a
youtuber or beauty influence or do
Instagram or anything like that I
definitely check out actually I will
leave a link below if you use my
referral link i get like extra points i
believe but basically they have like a
free store and brands can put in their
products there and you can request the
products and some you get approved from
some you don't get approved from and
then they will send you the products and
then you need to feature them in your
videos they can either be like reviews
you can use them in a tutorial like i'm
going to do now but you just have to
feature them in some way like maybe you
have a favorite product or something and
you can put it in there but that's kind
of how you do it you have so many days
that you're able to do it but I've
actually been receiving quite a few
products here lately from actively to
try out which is so so stinking cool i
really enjoy the Real Techniques brushes
i love the sponge in here like I have
this sponge already I've been through
like three of them I love them but I was
really excited to try these brushes
especially because I haven't tried them
out but again if you are a beauty
influencer you do have to have a certain
number of like subscriber counts on
YouTube and Instagram in order to be
accepted into actally but if you do
definitely check it out again I will
leave it linked down below but now i'm
going to try this maybelline powder
her with this brush and see how it goes
so the color is a little bit darker but
I tend to do that when it comes to my
powders I just like I just like my
powders they give me a little bit of an
oomph color wise because I'm typically
always so pale so I usually go a little
bit darker I really like this brush so
far feels really nice it's really soft
and that's what I think about most of
the Real Techniques brushes that I've
tried is that they are super soft but
it's putting the product on well also
I'm really curious to see how this
powder holds up throughout the day as
well it's so far it seems to be going on
really nice I've just heard so many
people raving about this powder and I'm
like okay okay I'm going to go get it
then so and it is supposed to be it's
from like the better skin line from
Maybelline I have the better skin
foundation and I have the better skin
concealer and it's supposed to help
perfect your skin as well and it does
have salicylic acid in there which is
good for like acne as well too I take
the powder down onto my neck of course
as well that's pretty cool especially
because I have quite a few hormonal
breakouts going on so hopefully this
powder will help out stuff that I really
don't like to skip even if I am in a
hurry is concealing on my under eyes I
think you can help writing up the under
eyes but also if you're anything like me
when I was in school I did not sleep a
lot like it just didn't happen so I
typically would struggle with the dark
under eyes and so I'm going to use my
maybelline fit me concealer I have the
shade light because it also it will
conceal the dark circles but then it
also highlights and here the eyes as
well so I'm just gonna place a little
bit on my under eyes I'm gonna do
anything crazy here like I'm not going
to do a full highlighting session I'm
not going to like baked and all that
stuff so I'm just going to put some on
my under eyes and I'm also going to
bring some on
eyelids as well tact as a shadow primer
I'm going to take my Real Techniques
makeup sponge and then just go ahead and
buff that out I'm going to grab the
concealer brush from that Real
Techniques kid and then my wet and wild
Dolce de leche contouring a palette I'm
going to take the setting powder over
here and place that on my under eyes as
well it's going to set the concealer but
I really like this powder because it
also helps brighten up the under eyes
and when you're in a hurry and you
haven't gotten a lot of sleep and you
just want to make sure you have the
right under eyes going on this is a
really good powder to choose then I will
also use it to set the concealer on my
eyelids so when we go in with the
shadows they don't go anywhere this is a
really nice brush I've been with this
brush in particular is one that I've
wanted to try for so long because I see
so many people using it to set their
under-eye concealer and I can see why
already it's so like small so can really
get in there let's get in the job done
and yeah I figured that was gonna like
this one ok so I'm going to move it to
the eyes real quick and I'm going to use
the BH Cosmetics and carli bybel
actionable palette I did mention this in
my back to school essentials video I'm
trying to use a lot of those products so
that I mentioned in that video in this
tutorial so you can see how i would use
them but this is a really fantastic
eyeshadow palette and very affordable as
well and it does have highlights in here
too but there are so many different
looks you can do with this but i'm just
going to show something really simple
basic neutral and most of all quick so
first I'm going to come in with my BH
Cosmetics big fluffy blending brush and
I'm going to take this a third color
right here it's a really like pretty
light mavi shade and I'm just going to
put that in the crease like a little bit
just a little bit higher than the crease
and blend it out
then I'm going to take this second shade
right here it's a really pretty like
pink almost like rose gold type of pink
shimmer color and I'm just going to use
a flat shader brush also from
bhcosmetics I'm going to apply that all
over the lid and I love this shade
because it really helps give like a
bright eyed look which again is kind of
like like what we're going for we're
trying to fool people into thinking
we've gotta do some nights sleep and
we're just so excited to be back at
school and all right I have this shimmer
shade down I'm just going to come back
in with that first color on my BH brush
and I'm just going to kind of blend the
two together so it's just a really
pretty like soft pink mauve luck with
some shimmer to it super quick super
easy two colors you don't have to focus
on a lot of blending because nobody's
got time for that in the morning so for
eyeliner I'm going to take a mr. Bing
from colour-pop this has just been like
by Jam lately I cannot stop using this
as much some on my upper lash line I'm
not going to do any like wings or
anything because man if you mess up a
wing you're in trouble so wings I feel
like are not for school unless you have
a lot of time like you woke up early and
you had somewhere to be that day so I'm
just going to smudge a little bit on the
upper lash line and then also put it on
my waterline as well
what I like to do is come back in with
my flat shader brush no extra product
but just kind of like smudge along that
top line just so it's not like super
super perfect because that's I'm going
forward this look so if just kind of
smudge it out a bit so for my lower lash
line I'm going to grab my e36 brush from
morphe and i'm first going to come in
with that same color that we've been
working with the first one that I put in
my crease I'm going to smudge that on
sue the lower lash line I apologize if
you can hear my dog snoring in the
background because she has no respect
for me and she is snoring so well I
grabbed the shade next to it as well
it's just like a deeper mauve color and
again with the e36 brush i'm just going
to smudge that onto the lower lash line
as well Bert mascara I'm going to do
like two coats of the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara because obviously
I'm not going to go in with both these
because no one has time for that I
certainly did not have time for that so
we try to build my lashes up by doing a
couple coats of this mascara
so if you are like me and have like
decent eyebrows but you just want to
make them look a little bit fuller and
filled in it's really quick and easy to
just use like a tinted brow gel this one
is from Maybelline and it's their brow
drama I have mine and blonde and its
really quick and not only is it a brow
gel so it's going to hold the brows in
place but since it's tinted it gives a
little bit of oomph to your eyebrows one
who like fully needs to go out on their
eyebrows I mean I know that's more time
consuming which really sings but brow
gels really do save me but I'm just
going to run this through my brows real
quick just to give them a bit of
something and this is totally a step
that is optional I'm going to promise
you guys that I did not give an ounce of
care about my eyebrows in high school or
even in college like the only thing that
I did to them was wax them on a regular
basis because they can get pretty huge
if you like this brow gel from
maybelline i do want to try out the
gimme brow from benefit as well and see
how I like that because I hear pretty
good reviews about that too but this one
works if you're looking for a good
pencil I have the NYX micro brow pencil
and then the benefits what's the benefit
the goof proof pencil I really i think i
like the benefit one even more but the
next one is just a little bit more
affordable so again i don't know if it
makes like a huge huge difference to the
eyebrows what if you're in a rush but
you want to do something with i'm tryin
to brow gel because it can help you out
but i'm going to switch back to the face
now i'm gonna go back into my wet and
wild contouring palette i'm going to
take my morphe m530 i'm just going to
take the contouring shade and not really
like do a whole contour but i'm just
going to kind of like give some
dimension to my face so i'm going to run
it along my cheekbones here and then up
towards the temple like everybody has
like there are certain things that they
need to do in order to feel appropriate
to leave the house you know and my i
think if i had to pick like two things
that I really
always like want to make sure that I do
is eyeliner and either like contour or
bronze so I feel like my face just looks
like really really flat when I don't
give it any sort of dimension like you
can when you contour or bronze up the
skin so this is totally a step that you
can skip again as well I mean when it
comes to your back to school and you're
in a rush and if you're like in a real
rush rush I mean pick the two or three
things that you absolutely need to do
before you leave the house and just do
them you don't matter unfortunately your
math test is not going to care about
your eyeliner it's not what you're going
to be graded on hashtag math is hard for
blush I'm going to go in with luminoso
from Milani I'm gonna use my morphe em
427 this is a really nice duo fiber
brush like I've been raving about Milani
so much lately but it's a beautiful
peachy shimmery blush and i really like
it cuz i sometimes I can feel like it's
like a 211 because it has so much
shimmer to it it can almost act as like
a highlight as well so I'm actually not
going to do any other highlight more
than what this gives me because I really
do feel like it gives a nice highlight
to the cheekbones as well and it helps
me skip a step but of course the
highlights like your thing and you need
to make sure you do it you always can
that carli bybel pilot does have four
different highlight shades in it as well
so that is a really good choice her lips
i'm going to go in with alyssa from
colour-pop it's a really great everyday
pink color and I absolutely love this
ultra satin formula I really like this
formula too because it's long lasting so
you won't have to worry about like
touching up throughout the school day I
think a nude lip would pair really good
with this look as well and that's
actually what I was initially going to
reach for but I've been wearing nude
lips constantly lately so I thought
maybe I would switch it up for myself
but I've been wearing a lot of like
London and Abu Dhabi both from NYX
Cosmetics that are really affordable but
these color pop ultrasounds are only six
dollars so they're very affordable as
well and then to lock all of our makeup
in place and help it last a little bit
longer i'm going to give my face a spray
with the pixi by petra glow
again this is one that I mentioned in
the essentials as well and even though I
didn't use a primer in the beginning I
do want to make sure that i set my face
so that the makeup stays in place all
day it kind of helps give you like an
instant glow as well so this is
something that I think would be good to
like keep in your purse or your backpack
make if you ever need like a refresher
throughout the day you can spray your
face with that and I think it does
amazing things but once you've sprayed
your face then your back-to-school look
is complete everything for my back to
school makeup tutorial I really hope
that you guys elected this look and you
found it to be quick and easy and
achievable for you as well I hope
everybody who's going back to school
whether you're going to like middle
school high school college whatever it
is I wish you the best of luck with the
school year I hope it is fantastic for
you I'm also so excited for my niece
Maya this is her final year of high
school she is a senior this year which
is so weird to think that I'm an aunt to
someone who was a senior in high school
like what but I just want to give a
shout out to my I believe that she

this one maya i love you i hope you have
