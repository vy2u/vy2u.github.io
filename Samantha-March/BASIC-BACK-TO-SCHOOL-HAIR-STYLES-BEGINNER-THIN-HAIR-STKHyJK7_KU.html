so today's video is going to be another
back-to-school themed video and it is
going to be on hairstyles so when I
asked what back-to-school type of videos
people wanted to see the most requested
was a makeup tutorial and I posted that
last week and right below that was hair
tutorials there was a lot of requests
for this video which is the reason why
I'm doing it because disclaimer I'm not
very good at doing hair I don't really
have any sort of skills when it comes to
hair so I'm way out of my comfort zone
right now but because of how many
requests I got I thought okay I really
need to try to do this and I thought it
was so funny because I feel like in
every video this is what my hair looks
like sometimes I throw a braid in it but
I don't ever have cute hairstyles and
any of my video is this so I'm like okay
so that kind of came out of nowhere but
because of the number of requests I
really did want to do this video and
I've been watching back-to-school you
know hair tutorial video so I could get
some ideas or inspiration and help for
myself and of course because it's back
to school the theme is like quick and
easy nothing too elaborate nothing too
wild nothing too time-consuming and that
sort of thing and I thought okay those
are the hairstyles that I actually do
myself because I'm not very skilled when
it comes to hair so I thought okay I'm
gonna go ahead and give this a whirl so
the majority of the hairstyles are going
to be heatless hairstyles and that's
what I will start off with and then I
will show a couple using the GHD wave
which looks like this and GHD is
sponsoring that portion of the video so
in the video I will show some styles
using the GHD wave I'm excited for this
video and to do something a little bit
outside of my comfort zone so if you're
ready to see some up back-to-school hair
tutorials why don't I go ahead and get
started so for the first one that I want
to do is a simple little pony but a lot
of times I remember in high school I
always added just a little bit of an
extra twist to my low ponies and this
video might be kind of hard to you don't
have anybody to film with me so it can
be a little bit challenging like trying
to make sure I'm in the frame and
everything but basically I'm just going
to gather all of my hair into a low pony
and it's something
might not know about me is that I
actually don't like my ears so a lot of
the styles that you'll see me do I am
covering my ear so if anybody thinks you
have big ears or your ear stick out you
can hopefully get some tips from me in
this video because it was something that
I was always really self-conscious about
especially back in high school but I'm
just going to gather all of my hair into
a semi low pony just gonna secure it
with an elastic and then what I like to
do just to create more than just like a
simple basic ponytail is I will just
take a piece of hair right from the top
of the ponytail and I just take a piece
right here I think I want to do just a
little bit bigger and then I will just
wrap it around the ponytail and once I
have it wrapped all the way around at
the ponytail holder I will just add in a
bobby pin right underneath the ponytail
so that way the bobby pin is kind of
hidden and then that extra hair is kind
of tucked underneath as well so nobody
can see it always such an easy trick for
me if I wanted to have my hair up and
out of my face but I still wanted to
just give it a little extra boost I
would just do like the genie rep around
the ponytail holder and boom super
simple so next time I'm going to do a
high bun and when I do my high buns I
typically grab some hair from the front
and leave them down and like little
tendrils around my face sometimes I
would curl them if I thought they look
like too flat like if they just if I had
really long hair which I did I remember
once in a while in high school if it was
too long I would just simply curl those
pieces and I just took a few seconds to
do but I do like my high buns to be
pretty high and pretty messy looking and
then I like to have those pieces out
mostly to cover my ears because
something I'm still insecure about at
the age of 30 so I like to put all of my
hair back so it's all going the same way
and before I do anything I'll kind of
take any pieces down and again never
anything precise you know a lot of times
it's so funny because you go for like
the messy bun look but who ends up doing
their messy bun ten times until it looks
the right amount of messy because that
was always me so once I have the desired
amount of hair down to cover my ears
I'll just get the bun as high as I
and a lot of times what I do is I start
to actually twist my hair and then I
flip it up underneath my hand and then
I'll go ahead and wrap the elastic
around it and I kind of pull it only
half away so you kind of have like this
one bun in the back and then you have
another bun up here and then I pull both
of the buns until I get it where I want
it to be so I like doing it this way I
feel like I kind of have a bun here and
then I almost have like hair surrounding
that bun and that is the way that I do
my buns typically I just twist and then
flip it underneath my hand and then
secure with the elastic and pull and
again I have my hair down in the front
mostly to cover my ears and I could
never do like that slicked back a really
tight ponytail type of look because I
just I just would not be able to pull it
off I would just not be comfortable with
it but this is one of my go-to
hairstyles still to this day I mean so
often I am rocking a gun like this but
this is look number two high bun with
some pieces in the front the next step
I'm gonna do the top not the top not is
one of my go-to hairstyles I just I love
it so what I do when I'm doing a top
knot it is super similar to how I did my
high bun where I twist and then wrap and
then kind of make like the two buns
that's exactly how I do my top knot as
well so what I do first is I just start
grabbing hair in the middle here and
this is really how I do my hair I don't
use like combs or brushes or tools or
anything like that to help me I just use
my fingers and I figure it out from
there so I know I've seen some people
like use those really like fine tooth
combs to create like the perfect lines
that is that's just that's that's not
how I do it so that's not how I was
going to do it for a video but I don't
even know if I own one of those combs to
be completely honest with you
but what I do first is grab like this
section here from the front like this
and obviously like one of the reasons I
love the top knot is because I still
some hair out of my face but at the same
time I also have a lot of hair in front
of my ears so there's that so what I do
after I've grabbed this first one I have
really really thin hair so if I learn to
put this into a bun
that wouldn't really work out for me so
what I do is actually start to grab from
the back section of my hair as well I
have some hair at it from the back you
can see I have more here for the top
nuts I'll do the same thing where I kind
of twist it and then flip it up to hold
it underneath my hand and then secure
the elastic and then pull through
halfway and then start to pull the two
buns and once I have it pulled to where
I want to sometimes with the top knots I
have to like add bobby pins or you know
right to it like you know four to five
times to get to my machine top nut but
that is all I do for my top knot really
similar to how I do my high bun X is my
next look and it's just a simple top
knot of course braids are super simple
quick and easy especially just regular
old braids which I have recently started
to learn a French braiding I'm going to
attempt it to French braid next I've
also been trying to get a handle on
fishtail braids but a lot of times just
one braid off to the side or two braids
down the middle here I did cheerleading
when I was in high school and a lot of
times I would just raid my hair into
regular braids on each side of my head
and then I would just do like big bows
on each of the braids which was super
cool but I totally did it a lot of times
I do not grade my regular hair when I'm
doing braids I actually put extensions
in because I have incredibly thin hair
so when I do braids I'm kind of
embarrassed because they're so tiny so a
lot of times when you see me with a
braid any kind of braid I typically have
my extensions in and I think that you'll
be able to tell because my braids are
just so little I saw that I did a locks
back in my high school days one thing
that I always do is pull out my braids
as well I mean to try to make them look
a little bit not quite so tiny but I
mean look at that like that's a tiny
braid but it is what it is so I'm just
gonna do it the same thing over on this
side funny because I learned how to
braid when I was young and it's so hard
for me to even explain how to regular
right like it's still hard for me to
explain my finger
just do it without me even thinking
about it but I have struggled so much
trying to learn how to French braid and
trying to learn how to fishtail braid
those two have been so hard for me
I cannot fishtail braid my regular hair
it's too thin it's too hard to hold on
to like there's just no chance I can
fishtail my regular hair if I ever want
to do fishtail braids I have to be
wearing my extensions otherwise it just
there's there's there's nothing doing so
it's too simple braids down here is
super fast just super easy if you were
doing any sports where you need to have
hair off your face and all that fun
stuff like I did for cheerleading this
is a good option because it's so quick
and simple so the next hairstyle to show
is just some nice ole regular braids
voila so I was gonna do a French braid
like I said but I really can't do it
without being able to have a mirror
because I'm just learning how to French
braid I have to be able to have a mirror
and I tried so hard to finagle any sort
of setup that I could to get a mirror
that's not gonna happen so we're just
gonna go ahead and screw up the French
braid but if you do know how to French
braid that's a super simple look that
you can do as well but I feel really
uncomfortable putting that in a tutorial
video when I can't actually show a
tutorial because of how my setup is so
I'm just gonna move on to some of the
heated hairstyles so I'm gonna be using
this GHD wave like I said GHD is
sponsoring this portion of the video
using a heated hairstyles so they were
kind enough to send me the GHD wave I
was able to pick this out and I did pick
this one out because I felt like it was
really different from anything that I
really have there is no like tong to it
at all you just have the curling wand
here and it's supposed to help create
waves in your hair versus like more
traditional curls so I'm going to plug
it in let it get hot and then I'm going
to show you waves using one technique on
one side of my hair and then waves on
the other side of my head using a
different technique so this is the GHD
wave and if I can show you close this is
the power button on it so you can tell
that it's on when it lights up and it
also makes noises at you which
that was very interesting I don't think
I've ever had such a high-tech hair
accessory and like when it gives to its
hottest which is in like I don't trying
to be realistic I would say 20 seconds
first thousand times I five seconds it
takes like 20 to 30 seconds to get it at
its hottest level like I have it right
here and it is so warm but it also kind
of like vibrates in your hand I think
when it gets to like its highest setting
which is crazy like this is so high-tech
so I could show you some waves as well I
decided to include it in a
back-to-school hair tutorial just
because I did this when I was going back
to school if I can be really honest here
for a second one thing that I did a lot
was crimp my hair did anybody else own a
crimper cuz this girl today and I
wouldn't crit my hair a lot and I don't
have a new shame but also like I said I
was a cheerleader so a lot of times when
I was doing my ponytail I was putting
curls in my hair or because I've always
struggled with thin hair I've just done
curls a lot one thing that I did a lot
though in high school was I would
actually curl my hair the night before
and then sleep in them it's something
that I still do now to this day because
sometimes when I use more of a regular
curling iron it's almost like my curls
are too tight after I first do them but
if I brush my hair they fall completely
out so I can't do that so a lot of times
if I'm doing something the following day
and I want my hair to have like a nice
curl or wave to it or just some sort of
volume I actually curl my hair the night
before sleep on it like normal and then
when I wake up I like my curls a lot
better so that was one thing I also did
in high school if I wasn't curling my
ponytail as I would curl my hair the
night before or crimp it whatever you
know no judgments here but I'm gonna go
ahead and show you how I curl hair on
one side and then also on the other side
so let's see I'm gonna start with this
side first because I think it'll be a
little bit easier so I'm just going to
take sections that are roughly as big as
the barrel on the GHD wave and like I
said this doesn't have any tongs you're
not like crimping your hair between hair
tongs or anything like that so I'm just
going to wrap it around so what I'm
gonna do is actually turn my curler so
it's facing downwards and then I'm going
to grab the hair and I'm going to be
spinning it away from my face
hold it here for just a few seconds and
then when I drop it you can see the wave
to my hair so it's not like a classic
curl I'm gonna grab another section and
do the same thing I'm going to point it
down and then turn my hair around it and
hold for a few seconds and I do leave
the ends out when I'm curling I go ahead
and drop and again we just have this
nice wave I'm gonna do another section
so this is what one side it can look
like holding it the wand point it down
and then turning the hair away from my
face I like these waves because I feel
like they're not tight curls are not
tight spirals they're just kind of those
loose relaxed almost kind of like beachy
waves and that's the look that I go for
when I'm curling my hair like this is
what I want to achieve so that's why
I've been really liking the wave because
instead of using the regular curling
iron and then trying to like carefully
brush out the curls or anything like
that like you're just kind of getting
that desired look that I have for just a
bit of but nothing too over-the-top
so that is one side that you can do and
then it for the other side it'll show
you a different way to curl the hair so
I'm gonna start with a piece back here
it's so hard to do by myself so what I'm
gonna do is kind of hold the wand
vertical like this and I'm going to wrap
the hair towards my face and then when I
get it all in I'm gonna take the wand
and kind of move it up like this and
then hold for a couple of seconds I
don't have like cool hair terminology
like other people do so sorry about that
after I have waited it long enough I'm
going to release the wand and release
the curls and can you see how that gives
a different curl from what we did on the
other side and repeat that a few times
is he on here a ton because it's not
great for your hair like I don't want a
blow dryer type of thing but again
because I have such thin hair curling my
hair has always kind of helped obviously
give my hair more volume and give it a
bit of a boost and of course at the same
time I don't really like to spend a ton
of time on my hair because I'm not a big
hair person so having a wand like this I
can kind of help cut your time down
really does help I don't leave my front
piece on as long as I do some of the
other pieces but once I have that can
you tell that this side is just a little
bit more loose and relaxed whereas this
side you have kind of like not super
tight curls still they're not real tight
spirals but they're just a little bit
more of like the curly Q's over on this
side so depending on how you hold your
wand and if you're pulling your hair
away from your face or towards your face
can really change the type of curls that
you have and again I have been here so
it is kind of like fast for me to curl
my hair but this does help - it heats up
really quickly as well but that is a few
different styles that you can do with
something like it's a GHD wave alright
guys so so that is going to do it for
some different back-to-school hair ideas
/of somewhat tutorials this video was so
incredibly challenging to make and I
hope that it comes out in somewhat of a
cohesive manner it's just really hard
when I'm not great with hair but then
filming only having the one angle
because I film by myself and not being
able to film with a mirror I had just
scrapped actually a lot of my hair ideas
I don't know how many styles we're
actually gonna come out with all of you
guys like that hopefully I turned out
decent enough there was just so many
requests to see hairstyles and the quick
and easy back-to-school hairstyles that
I wanted to try to put this video
together the best that I could we know
some of your favorite quick and easy
hairstyles as well I would love to know
thank you to G HD for sponsoring a
portion of this video as well that was
awesome and I've really been enjoying
that new waver it's just super fast and
super easy super handy I've never had
anything really like that so that's been
a lot of fun to use if you
enjoy this video I hope that you will
give it a thumbs up I hope that you will
also consider subscribing before you go
