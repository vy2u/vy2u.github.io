today's video I'm really excited for
because it's going to kick off a new
series on my channel the beauty battle
series basically what am i doing what
the beauty battle each time I post a
video I'm gonna have a couple of rounds
within each video and I'm going to be
pitting two makeup products that are
very similar to one another
against each other telling you a little
bit about them and then declaring one a
winner today's video is going to be
focused on eyeshadow palettes so the
four different rounds in today's video
is going to be sister palettes colorful
palettes a pastel palettes and then also
dupe palette so I'm excited for this
beauty battle series if you are and if
you have any other ideas or categories
that you would like to see in the future
please do of course let me know in the
comments but if you want to check out my
first Beauty battle video let me go
ahead and get started
alrighty I have had this video idea for
the longest time it has been on my list
forever so I'm really excited to kick it
off and I wanted to kick it aw I should
have pellets for a couple different
reasons I feel like people would be
interested in that because I shoulda
pellets are always like good amongst
like the chatter and whatnot but also
because I have an eyeshadow palette
declutter coming up like it's been
looming it's in looming on my schedule
and I thought this would be a good way
to kind of go through my collection and
see what it is I prefer the first one
that I want to talk about is a sister
palettes and to be honest I'm not for
sure these are totally considered sister
palettes but I'm gonna go ahead and call
them that but I wanted to include these
because getting a lot of questions over
which one I would recommend so the
palettes that I am talking about are
from morphe and they are the 25 a and
the 25 B palettes these palettes did
release at the same time they are very
similar to one another you can tell what
I mean packaging number of shades the
amount of shades that you're getting and
all of that like price is exactly the
same and I've had a lot of people say
especially once more if he came into
Alta and these palettes came onto Alta
people have said which one would you
recommend the 25 a r 25 B so that's why
I wanted to include these as the sister
palettes before at this video so like I
said they are the same price they are
$18 you can get them on the morphe
website you can buy both of them
together for I think it'd be a $2
discount if you purchased the two of
them in that
no but I'm not sure the last time I
checked it was sold out somehow which is
weird because both palettes were still
available at that time separately but I
don't know there's that you get 25 pans
in each one and they are the same amount
but I couldn't find the exact amount but
I have some of the other ones I'll talk
about like how many grams you're getting
in each and stuff but I don't usually go
like that in depth in my type of reviews
but I couldn't find that and there
wasn't anything on these about that I
did not purchase these myself I actually
got them as a gift from a subscriber
named Jordan so a big THANK YOU to her
because I wanted to purchase these they
came out last Christmas I want to say it
was like the day after Christmas or
something they released and I missed
them and I was super bummed about it and
when they came back she actually sent
them to me which I thought was very very
exciting I'm so big thank you to her
because when I tried these out I
immediately was like whoa these are
really freaking good I feel like the
formula in here is definitely different
from some of the original like 35
palettes from morphe that I was trying
out with the three 503 5 T things like
that so I think this one is definitely
more similar to like the 3 5 r palette
which I really enjoy and then also I've
heard a lot of people say that this
formula is exactly the same as the new
Jaclyn hill in morphe palette and I'm
not sure I think people have even said
they like looked up the ingredients but
I still do like that Jaclyn hill palette
just a little bit better but seriously
this is a really good eye shadow formula
and if you don't like the big 35 pellets
that morphe has which are like $22 i
think i mean these are definitely
smaller more compact like easy to travel
with and all of that and you're just
getting a few less shades but again they
are the $18 versus the I think they're
now 23 across-the-board for the 35
palettes from morphe so the formula to
me and both of these are exactly the
same I don't really notice much of a
difference between them formula wise I
feel like the 25a has more metallic
shimmers in here I like that you get a
mixture of matte and shimmers across
each of them but this one I feel like
definitely has more like pop and shimmer
shades to play with especially the gold
which I feel like I don't even have to
point at the gold because it just pops
immediately but that is
very beautiful gold so I like the 25 a
for that reason again I just feel like
with some of these like lighter
transition shades the brown shades the
taupe shade etc feel like you're
basically getting the same shades across
both the palette and the difference I
feel like is that in this palette you're
getting a little bit more of these
darker tones down here if you have the
deeper Browns you have kind of like a
deep plum over here some of these
shimmer shades are a little bit darker
and then when you go over into the 25a
you have some of the lighter shades at
the bottom here at some of these lighter
shimmer colors of that gold this is a
really pretty kind of like pinky taupe
color but you do also get some Dark
One's down here and then you also do get
a black in the 25a as well
I feel like with the 25a you're just
getting a little bit more diversity in
here you're getting a little bit more
shade selection than you do in the 25b
and like I said I also do prefer kind of
the metallic shimmers and this one
compared to the 25 B so while they are
extremely similar to one another do I
think that you need both of these
palettes no because they are so similar
with just a few different tweaks amongst
them of course as with everything makeup
is personal preference so when I'm
choosing a winner for these and listing
my reasons my reason that something as a
winner could be the reason that you
would choose that as the loser so keep
that in mind and keep that in mind in
the comments of course with us all
personal preference but if what I'm
saying is a pro is a pro to you then you
would probably enjoy the winner that I
am picking but for the reasons that I
said just more diversity in here the
more metallic colors in here
I would prefer the 25a and this would be
the winner across the sister pellets
from the 25 a and the 25 B again I don't
think that you need both but if you love
eyeshadow palettes and your eyeshadow
palette collector and you don't think
the $18 is a bad price for two of them
they are both really nice I should
appellate e in here and I really do
enjoy both of them but if I am putting
them head-to-head against one another 25
a is the winner all right next up afford
the round 2 we are gonna be talking
about pastel eyeshadow palette so we are
going to be putting up the lorac Pro
brunch palette against the Sigma creme
de Couture palette okay so for the lorac
brunch palette it is $44 this is a
limited-edition palette and I do not
think it is available anymore but in
case you have both of these or they come
back at some point you know you never
know when palettes are gonna come back
up you don't know when they're gonna
come on HauteLook you don't know when
you're going to find them at look at
t.j.maxx and that sort of thing so I did
want to mention that but it is a
limited-edition you get 16 shades in
here you also get a mirror each shade is
point for eight ounces or you get 14
point to four grams overall with the
brunch palette from LaRocca so there is
what that one looks like and then the
Sigma palette that we are comparing this
is the creme de Couture it came out in
the Holiday Collection this past holiday
season again it is limited-edition and I
don't think it's available anymore if it
is for sure I will leave it licit down
below but I do hope Sigma brings this
one back because I know a lot of people
really did enjoy it this one is $39 you
get 16 shades you get a mirror you get
point for one ounces or eleven point six
eight total grams of product and here is
what the inside of this one looks like
about $44 versus a 39 you get the same
amount of shades in each one but you
actually do get more shades overall with
a the lorac one which initially
surprised me I really thought it was
going to be the Sigma but it was the
lorac that gave you more now I will say
that not a lot of people seem to enjoy
this
lorac palette I put it in the makeup I
love that everyone hates video I'm
pretty sure and while I wouldn't say and
I believe I said it in that video it's
not something that I absolutely love and
adore but I still did like the palette I
did purchase this one myself and I did
not return it I did get this one from
Sigma in PR and I am a Sigma affiliate
the lorac palette I will definitely say
that I mean it's very much a pastel
palette and you can tell when looking at
it but I will say that the shades are
very kind of like hit and miss
across-the-board some of them are
extremely beautiful avocado toast I
really enjoyed blueberry scone I thought
that one it was really nice as well well
there are some nice shades in here that
look really pretty on the eyes it just
was a little bit hit and miss with the
Sigma creme de Couture palette one of
the first things that I noticed with
this one is of course it is a pastel
palette you can tell from looking at it
but I feel like you can tell the
difference right off the bat between
this one and the lorac one but this is
just more vibrant and that definitely
comes across on the eyes as well like
yes you're still creating a pastel look
but the color
more poppin a more vibrant on the lids
which I really do appreciate another
thing that I will say about this palette
from Sigma that I really enjoyed was
that I feel like you get more transition
colors in here to create a complete eye
look I didn't quite feel like I could
create a complete eye look with a lot
brunch I was having to go into another
palette for transition colors colors to
put on the outer part of my lid to kind
of deepen up the eye look and that sort
of thing so I felt like I was more
limited with the looks that I could
create as a whole with this palette then
with the Sigma palette because you have
like apricot flower or passion fruit
that you can put as a transition color
and then you even have this deeper brown
shade over here or ginger pumpkin that
you can put on the outer part of the lid
and then you still have all these
beautiful fun colors that you can play
with so I did enjoy that one out of the
Sigma palette the lorac palette really
the only ones that I could use was a
sorbet and mimosa and both of those are
still so light they have to take a
really long time to blend them into the
crease to get them to show up and then
again those were my only two options and
this one has more of a pinky tone and
this one has more of an orange tone so
sometimes depending on what color I was
going to come with on the lid it didn't
quite work I also felt like when
building up the colors with both of
these palettes you just had to take
longer with the lorac brunch
no matter what color it was that I was
putting on the lid I would just have to
take a longer amount of time the
shimmers definitely do require a setting
spray or like some sort of damp brush
when putting them on the lid and it just
took longer the Sigma palette this one
is all masks vs. mattes and shimmers
like the lorac brunch but you don't have
to take up a lot of time with this one
and you're still getting a more vibrant
I look out of it so between the two with
the Sigma creme it's a Couture and then
also the lorac brunch of the winner in
this category for the pastel palettes
would be the Sigma creme and they
Couture it's also a little bit cheaper
again both of these palettes were
available right now this one would be at
the more affordable option and this is
the one that I would recommend enjoy
creating pastel looks I think that you
would really get a lot of use out of
this one and I really didn't enjoy it so
round 2 winner goes to Sigma I tried to
bump up my brightness on my camera not
part of camera settings but I don't know
if I did
but it's kind of dark here today but
it's actually warmer so the snow is
melting so it's not as bright outside
which I've been complaining about it
being too bright outside and I'm like
hey it's not bright enough where's the
Sun
anyways moving on to round 3 or any be
talking about colorful pellets in this
round so we are going to be talking
about the Urban Decay heavy metal shadow
pellet versus the Kevin Kwan electro pop
eyeshadow palette all righty then
so for the urban decay this is a $55 I
did see it's for sale right now for $39
on the sephora website but the original
retail price of this one is $55 to get
twenty eyeshadows and then you also do
get a mirror I believe this one is
limited edition because it was a part of
the holiday release but it didn't say
that on Sephora but I think that one is
limited edition and then the second
palette that we have here is the Kevyn
Aucoin electro-pop palette this one is
at $57 you do get twelve different
shades you also do get a mirror and this
one is a confirmed limited-edition
eyeshadow palette so you want to say
that I did receive both of these in a PR
which is always a super exciting for me
so I will say right off the bat that
packaging wise the Kevyn Aucoin one wins
this battle because it's just the kind
of like nice little regular packaging
it's easy to travel with it's small its
compact it has the nice mirror right
there like its packaging wise it's a yes
there are been a k1 I mean the packaging
on this one is cool do not get me wrong
it's cool and funky but I will also say
the first time that I was taking this
out what you do is you kind of press the
side here and then the palette comes out
I did not realize that and the first
time that I went to do it I popped it
like this and the palette went shooting
out and I grabbed it and it I mean it
almost hit the floor and shattered
everywhere I did not know my reflexes
were that fast but I'm glad that they
work because that was almost a disaster
the very first time I opened the palette
and just inside the layout is a little
bit different and I get it and it's cool
and all of that but it's a little bit
different the mere placement is a little
bit different and a fear YouTube we're
making a video like this it's kind of
challenging with this packaging so
there's that you know like traveling
wise and things like
it's a little bit harder to travel with
kind of a bigger bulkier pallet like
this so packaging wise I got to give it
to Kevin of Quan you do get more shades
in the urban decay 2012 with the Kevin
of Quan and I think that you get more of
a variety of different shades in this
one which i think is to be expected if
you're getting eight shades so I do kind
of have to cover up the mirror here to
try to give you a close-up but I mean
you really have a lot of shade variety
and here even though on this side it
almost kind of looks like you don't
because you have a bunch of different
Browns up here but instead of being
super similar to one another they are
different enough which I do appreciate
not only are these colorful palettes but
they are both shimmer palettes as well
so I do want to point that out and so I
feel like you're getting just a bigger
shade range in here from the Browns the
Gold's the light shades you have greens
you have Blues you've Reds you know the
cranberry colors in here and all of that
which I do appreciate and over to the
cover no Quan here is a bit of a close
up of this palette I still do think that
you're getting a nice variety of shades
we have like a brown in there kind of
like a muted yellow gold a very nice
light purple the teal in here is really
beautiful there's a blue and you also
have your really deep shade back here
this formula and the cavern upon palette
I feel like is really kind of different
because it's almost like a cream it's a
powder shadow versus just straight
powder which I feel like is what you get
in the urban decay so the texture on
these is a little bit different but the
majority of the shades in here are
really really nice and I feel like they
show up really well you don't need a
damp brush for every single shade but
they're just a little bit more pigmented
and popping with that damp brush but I
feel like in here like this is a really
really nice I shadow palette I will say
though that was it the urban decay I
like this one just just a smidge smidge
more and it's because I really feel like
there's just more variety of shades in
here and I can really complete still a
full makeup look which sounds weird
because there's no mattes in here but
what I like to do with this palette is I
like to create kind of like a halo
shimmer eye with this one and I've done
it quite a bit with different shades in
here one of my first looks that I did
with this palette was I put after-party
in the outer part and the inner part
my I came in with this shade over here
called punk rock I put that in the
center of the lid and I thought it came
out so pretty I've done a lot of
different I'll shimmer halo eyes with
this one and I feel like it just looks
really beautiful I love that we have you
know kind of the more neutral colors
over here and I like that we can go
super funky I like that we have some
like highlight shades over here for the
inner corner and the brow bone and I
like that we go deep that we go light
like I just feel like there's a few more
options in the Urban Decay then there is
in the Kevin Daquan this one was
probably the hardest though to choose
between because I think both pellets are
really really phenomenal like these ones
were like head-to-head especially when
you compare price they're only two
dollars apart yes you get eight more
shades in here but the packaging is
better on this one so I was like how do
I choose a winner out of this one but I
really did want to choose a winner and I
think my winner I know my winner is the
Urban Decay heavy metal palette I like
this one just a little bit more and I
have found myself for reaching for it a
little bit more so this is going to be
the one the winner of round 3 is the
Urban Decay heavy metal but truly I
don't think you can go wrong with you
the palette already and then our fourth
and final round today is going to be
doop eyeshadow palettes so we are going
to be talking about the makeup
revolution light and shade eyeshadow
palette compared to the bad habit
aphrodite eyeshadow palette so the
makeup forever is I do for the Kat Von D
shade + light contour palette the bad
habit Aphrodite is a dupe for the hooter
Beauty rose gold eyeshadow palette I
believe it is I do own the dupe for this
one or the one that this one duped
I only Kat Von D shade and light palette
I do not own the huda beauty palette so
I can't actually compare them both other
palettes for them but I'm just going to
be comparing these two together but I
thought it could be maybe a bit of a fun
category so for the makeup revolution
this one is $15 you can get it on the
Ulta website as well it is 14 grams
total you get 12 shades there is no
mirror in this one and the packaging is
just kind of like plastic packaging like
nothing too super fancy about this one
with the bad habit Aphrodite palette
this one is $12 you are getting 18 grams
of product and you get 18 shades there
is a mirror and the packaging is just
quite a bit nicer than the makeup
revolution packaging
you have the nice mirror there right at
the back this one is not only cheaper
you get more overall product inside you
get more shades you get a mirror and you
have better packaging a downside to this
one though is it's not as easily
accessible whereas this one can also be
found on the alte website this one was
sent to me from a shop hush so you can
get it on shop hush or the shop hush app
or the bad habit website but it's not
available at retailers such as alta
whereas this one is so that is a pro I
believe afore the makeup revolution
palette I'll say one thing that did make
me super happy about this palette is you
know not only are both of these dupe
palettes and they look you know
extremely similar to the higher-end
palettes that we're talking about I
think one thing that kind of rubbed me
the wrong way about this one is that
they called it the light and shade
palette where the Kat Von D is the
shaded light I was like quick you
couldn't do anything different like you
couldn't even give it a different name
like no it's like that one kind of
rubbed me the wrong way with this one
whereas with this one I mean at least
it's called Aphrodite palette and they
didn't call it like the gold rose
palette what so that's one thing I'll
say everything make up forever eyeshadow
palette I have had this one for a while
I did purchased this one myself from
Ulta like I said this one was a sent to
me I did purchase this one myself from
Ulta and I mean it's it's exactly
identical to the Kat Von D shade and
light palette I will say with this one I
do not think it as good as the Kat Von D
I still think there are very blendable
eyeshadows but they're definitely not
the most pigmented that I've ever seen
and really I barely reach for this
palette if I want to go for my all mag
kind of neutral look I'm going into the
Kat Von D shade + light I think they're
even more blendable than this palette
and I think they're more pigmented and I
don't have to put as much work into the
original palette than I do with this
palette this one you can tell like it's
just it is the $15 version of a higher
price palette it's good but it's not
that good so that's what I'll say about
that again with this one I can't compare
it to the dupe palette but I have used
this several time I will say that this
is a really nice eyeshadow palette I've
been having very good luck
I haven't used every single shade out of
it yet but I've gotten pretty darn close
to it and I've really liked what I've
been able to create I think that they
are nice and blend
the shimmer so far I'm having a great
time with and I really enjoyed this
shade selection in here you do get a
mixture of matte and shimmers versus the
makeup revolution which is all mattes
but I just feel like I'm creating some
really fun makeup looks and I love the
color selection in here the packaging is
definitely better on this one I enjoy
that you get a mirror overall I just
think you have more of a shade selection
you have a better shades in here and you
have more variety of the different looks
that you can create and also the
packaging is a lot better the only
downside to this one is that again it's
not as easily accessible as the makeup
revolution but for the fourth and final
run for this one the winner of the dupe
palette battle is going to be the bad
habit aphrodite palette are you guys so
that is going to do it for my first a
beauty of battle makeup video I hope
that you guys enjoyed this video or you
think it's a fun idea if you do and if
you want to see more of them but please
do let me know in the comments again let
me know any other categories you'd want
to see whether with eyeshadow palettes
or is there another part of the makeup
collection that you would want to see
other categories are products that you
want to see against each other I would
love to know I just thought this could
be a little bit of a fun idea maybe I
could do a video like once a month or so
if you guys are interested in the beauty
battle series but I had a lot of fun
with this one and it kind of was fun to
kind of look up each of the different
products and really kind of set the
palettes out and compare them I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
and if you did of course I hope that
you'll give it a thumbs up I hope that
you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I will catch you guys
in tomorrow's video right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
