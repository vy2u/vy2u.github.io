today's video is going to be about
brands that I am loyal to this and video
idea came to me I don't know a month or
so ago when in a particular video I kept
saying I'm very loyal to this brand I'm
very loyal to this brand and then a
subscriber actually mentioned a couple
brands that she was loyal to when I got
into a discussion about it in the
comments and I thought I can make a full
video on that so that is exactly what
we're doing today I'm gonna talk about
some of the brands I am most loyal to of
the brands that I continually repurchase
from and I have repurchased a lot from
and brands that I find myself
recommending quite a bit so before we
get started I do say thank you so much
for clicking on this video I am
currently uploading every single day so
if you do enjoy getting a daily content
on makeup and beauty related items that
I hope that you'll consider hitting the
subscribe button before you go but if
you would like to see some of the
brand's that I am loyal to why don't I
go ahead and get started so in any
particular order for this video and then
I thought I could grab out a few items
from each brand that I really you know
do love and would recommend for the
first brand that I want to mention is a
Tarte cosmetics I have been purchasing
from chard for a very long time and they
just continually seem it to impress me
there is not a lot that I buy from Tarte
that I'm like that really missed the
mark for me you know what I'm saying
like I'm just continually continually
impressed I think one of the first items
that I purchased from them up with their
tartlet and bloom pellets I highly
recommend I've also recommended over and
over their collaboration that they did
was styled by her Rouge I love this
eyeshadow palette most recently I
purchased their heart clay play palette
and I think it is such a phenomenal
eyeshadow palette like I'm just very
impressed with their eyeshadow palettes
on opal this is one of my absolute
favorites I continually reach for this
palette as well of course I'm a huge fan
of the shape tape I have recommended
this so often their latest chart Color
Splash rainforest of the sea ellipse
ticks are just absolutely beautiful
and I recently was able to try out their
rainforest of the sea foundation and I
love the foundation as well I feel like
the only real miss from Tarte that I can
think of off the top of my head is their
stick foundation I really wasn't a huge
fan of that which was a bummer but
seriously like every
else that I buy from tart I feel like I
get along with really well to feel like
they're a really good company I
recommended to follow them on snapchat
because they have an amazing snapchat
they work really hard over there I can
tell they also have an awesome blog
series going on right now on our YouTube
channel I will leave that elicit down
below as well about cosmetics I've been
purchasing from them for a long time and
I highly recommend this brand a
drugstore brand that I have been very
loyal to since the long before I had my
youtube channel is Maybelline Maybelline
is probably my favorite brand at the
drugstore I think I can say that pretty
well and it's just Maybelline is that
brand that my mom always used and I can
remember using her makeup when I was
much younger and as I went into high
school and then went into college I was
always gravitating towards the
maybelline section and then when I
started my youtube channel and I was
trying to you know just become
accustomed to having this beauty YouTube
channel and buying new makeup and not
feeling super comfortable yet buying
really high-end items I was in the
Maybelline isla at the drugstore thanks
so much from them and I continually
recommend a lot of products from them
they're a better skin foundation I also
uncle concealer I love this like look I
think I mentioned this in my used and
abused makeup tag like it has been a
hard for me to go through foundations
but that Maybelline better skin I love
their fit me line I have the powder
foundation I also have the concealer I
have been through a lot a lot of these
concealers and you can tell from my fit
me powder that I obviously really love
that as well the instant age rewind
concealer I mean I don't even know how
many of these I've gone through and I
continually still to this day recommend
that when people say I want something to
really cover my dark circles I'm like
this is the one this is the one that you
need the item that I think I love
probably the most from Maybelline and
that I continually recommend is their
lipsticks I think this is one of the
best drugstore lipsticks like just
regular old lipsticks so once remember
lean I think are amazing I just grabbed
out a couple here but I have I almost
pulled out my whole acrylic drawer
because I have so many more of the
Maybelline lipsticks but I love them I
think they are so good that they are so
affordable
I also recommend it Maybelline and the
brand so I think that you should follow
on snapchat because I think they have a
really good snapchat as well it's just
been really fun to watch Maybelline kind
of like expand and grow
I feel like they have some exciting
things coming up but Maybelline is
definitely a brand that I've been loyal
to it for many many years another brand
of that Ivan loyal to a for a very long
time is morphe brushes i talked about
morphe brushes a lot I recommend them a
lot I know like I feel like Morpheus
kind of a controversial brand but for me
I've always been really happy with my
morphe products and I have no problem
recommending them because they have
worked out so well for me I definitely
found morphe through YouTube and I
started buying from them before I had a
channel because I would always be
recommended on other YouTube channels as
well and I have quite a few of their
eyeshadow palettes this one was sent to
me in PR but it's just one of my
favorite palettes but like the 35 P the
35 oh the 35 R I bought all of those
palettes myself and I loved them and
then also their brushes I just recently
posted my favorite makeup brushes video
and you see a ton of morphe brushes in
there when I was first starting out and
kind of trying to work up my makeup
brush collection but still not wanting
to spend a ton of money because I didn't
quite really understand all the brush
functions it was nice to go with
something like morphe because they are
more affordable but they are still
really good quality so the only to my
favorite makeup brushes down below if
you want to check them out because a lot
of morphe is in there and I do not all
of their brushes are fantastic and you
see me say it in that video to some of
the brushes when you wash them they can
amuse lose their shape or lose their
bristles but I make sure to mention the
ones that I think could do that and give
alternatives to them up put a lot of
their brushes and especially their face
brushes do not do that so I would
recommend them but I have been
purchasing from working like I said
before I started my youtube channel and
I still have really good experiences
with them so I feel like I'm definitely
very loyal to Morphy
so another brand that I've been loyal to
for quite some time is Anastasia Beverly
Hills I have got quite a bit from
Anastasia I do really like her cloak
it's that might spend like one of the
first items so I purchased from that
brands I can't quite remember but I did
really like the glow kit I have the
sweet one and then another one only one
I didn't love for me was the the one in
collaboration with Nicole Guerrero but I
do like the glow kiss and then of course
I have the modern renaissance which I
absolutely love I recommend this so
often of course I did by the subculture
palette I have a review on it and one of
the very select few that actually like
the palette and I secured it works just
fine for me I also purchased the stick
foundation which when she came out with
it I didn't like it at first but I
mentioned it in the products I changed
my mind about because I actually like
kept trying I kept trying and I do like
it I think it's more of like a summer
foundation because the layer coverage
but I do like it and then just very
recently with my last Sephora order I
purchased the brow is because I hear so
much about the brow is I feel like one
of the only other things that didn't
really work for me
from Anastasi after liquid lipsticks I
just was not a huge fan of them I just I
don't really like how Lucy they are but
other than that I'm very loyal to the
brand I buy a lot from them I get
excited over her releases I actually
have a couple things from the brand as
well that are still like on my love list
and in my Ulta car and things like that
I would say that I am loyal to anasazi
Beverly Hills another brand I'd say I'm
loyal to and I've had this list for
quite some time now and so when I saw
this one of my list I was like should I
talk about it but I am still loyal right
now and I do still purchase from that I
made a purchase very recently from them
so I'm like you know what I'm still
going to talk about it and that brand is
Benefit Cosmetics recently benefit has
been doing some things that I'm not
really impressed with so there's that
but I haven't gone off the brand
I haven't boycotted the brand I haven't
stopped buying or using their products
I hope they move more in a direction
that I'm feeling as of right now I'm
kind of like teetering and like please
don't do a benefit please don't please
don't push me over the edge like
two-face did but I still did want to
mention them because I do own a lot from
them I purchased a lot from them I've
recommended them a lot and like I said I
just very recently did make a purchase
from them the very first thing I think
that I purchased from benefit was this
bronze of Champions I can remember
buying this at Sephora and it was
because so many people would recommend
the hoola bronzer and the hoola bronzer
came in here I was like I need I need
that hoola bronzer and so this kit was
you know on sale like benefit does a lot
of these these kits like this
it was on sale at Sephora one time so I
went ahead and bought it it did also
come with it the roller lash mascara
which I really do love as well as the
they're real mascara those are some of
my favorite mascaras but I do really
enjoy see hoola bronzer and also the
blood cell highlighter I do like that
one as well but this was kind of the
first thing that I purchased from
benefit and I really did like it and I
got a lot of use out of it because this
was like way back in the day this was I
mean this was over two years ago for
sure so I was when I had a smaller
collection and I worked as a crap out of
this thing one summer like it was like
all I was wearing I recently purchased
the hoola kwikki contour stick and I
loved it I used this I mean at least
once a week but probably more if I'm
cream contouring I typically am reaching
for the quickie contour stick I
absolutely love it from benefit and I'm
so happy that I made this purchase the
definite thing that I have purchased
tend to be most from benefit is their
brow products a lot of you might know
that I'm not great with my brows I I
never really know what I'm doing with my
brows like I feel like I'm getting
better and I really appreciate the
comments of like your browser listen
said like that really does help me I
only bought a lot from benefit with
their brows I think one of the first
things I purchased was their gimme brow
because it's more of like a fiber brow
product and that was one of the first
things that I purchased when I was like
trying slowly very baby steps to get
into brows it was the gimme brow and
then the next thing I purchased was
their goof proof pencil and I bought it
in shade two I went on to buy another
one in shade three sometimes I do too
sometimes I do three sometimes I mix
them both together I then went on to
purchase the precisely my brow I also
purchased the new kits that they have
out and I can't remember which one I
bought I want to say it was maybe like
the natural brow for just a ton of
benefit brow products and there they
were really the first brow product that
I tried that I felt like I could
actually get I have precisely my brow on
today and shade number two so I would
say right now I am still loyal to
benefit like I said I just recently
purchased that brow kit and then even
right before that was when I purchased
the hoola bronzer so I have purchased
from them recently I have my fingers
crossed that
they're not going to do anything to
really put me over the edge but I did so
want to mention them because I do so
like them I do so look remember I am
still buying from them I just I just
hope we don't have a breakup that was
thank you sad another brand I've been
loyal to before I even had my youtube
channel is Sigma beauty I love Sigma
beauty I especially love their brushes
again at Sigma was so highly featured in
my favorite makeup brushes video and
it's because I own so much Sigma I
started buying from Sigma like I said
before I had my channel and it's because
I would always see people recommending
the Sigma brushes and I worked off
recommendations just like everybody else
does and so when I saw people
consistently recommending Sigma I was
like I need to try that brand and I
absolutely adore them it was really
exciting to me because Sigma was the
first high-end makeup brushes that I
purchased and then my very first
affiliate affiliation with a brand was
Sigma beauty and that was just like a
really cool day to kind of like see
things come full circle it just it just
really meant a lot to me to have a brand
like Sigma reach out to me even have
such a small channel and want me to be
an affiliate it just it was really
really cool so that was awesome
I especially loved their brushes I
grabbed out their gel eyeliner because
it was sitting out right here but then
also it's kind of funny because I just
please can order one Sigma and it just
came today I haven't even really been
able to look at which I only was able to
tear into it because I've been so busy
today but I'm really excited I just got
some news Sigma goodies new eyeshadow
palette for more brushes because I don't
need any brushes but that's what I did
but I do love Sigma like I said I am an
affiliate with them so if you ever do a
purchase from Sigma and you want to save
some money you can use the code at
Samantha it saves you 10% I check out
but a sigma Beauty is definitely branded
that I have been very loyal to another
brand I have been loyal to this is
another one a little bit on the fence
about but I have been a loyal consumer
to them so I wanted to mention them is
color pub so the reason why I say that I
was a little bit on the fence about them
is because sometimes color pop just
doesn't make me super happy because they
have all of these super quick limited
edition read pieces and it just kind of
drives me crazy like sometimes just
their business model I'm like I can't
keep up man
I am loyal to color pop is another one
who I think I found color pops through
kathleenlights I went on to purchase a
lot of the super shock shadows I've
purchased the blushes from them I have
quite a collection of lipsticks I
recently did a lipstick declutter this
is everything that I kept from
colour-pop but most recently I have been
very impressed with their pressed
eyeshadow palettes these two are both
from the Isle of Sarah II collection so
I did purchase these pretty recently
myself but I tried their prints our
shadows before then and I was very I
like these much more than the super
shock shadows I did mention the color
public sticks and the makeup I change my
mind about and I actually changed my
mind for the worst and I've been meaning
to even declutter more of these I just
feel like over time they're ultra satin
lives in particular do weird things like
the colors change the texture changes I
tried to wear one in a MIDI the other
day which is this one I would try to
wear this from the other day and it was
just like super sticky and Columbia on
my lips so I need to go through this
again and kind of clear some more out
but I did so want to mention color pop
because it has been a brand I've been
very loyal to a lot in my color pop
collection and like I said I just very
recently purchased these so I would say
that I am still a loyal consumer to
color pop I know that I'll purchase more
from them sometime soon so yeah Kotov
somehow you just keep getting me and at
the final brand that I want to talk
about is appear cosmetics and I'm sure
he's been follow me for a while you can
like when when does she get to talk
about appear because the corn the most
talked about here I love here they're
one of my favorite braids and I feel
like they are so underrated I started
buying from Pierre back when I was like
18 19 years old and a very first item I
ever purchased one from them was they're
pressed for in one mineral powder you
can tell I love this one I don't even
know I mean it has to be the double
digits with how many I bought and I have
another one ready to go but I remember
stumbling into my Ulta wanting to find a
powder foundation picking up the Pier
one and just being obsessed with a brand
ever since I feel like they are
underrated I feel like not enough people
talked about them recently they came out
with a line of lashes that are my
absolute favorite you see me I linked my
makeup in my description box from every
single video and you typically are
seeing
pure lashes in a lot of those I love
them you see me wearing them on in too
I'm always tagging me wearing their
lashes their lashes are phenomenal so
I'm their patrols pellet I have
recommended this over and over again at
the Cameo contour stick you've seen me
use in so many tutorials another item
that I think is so super underrated from
piracies of vanity palettes right here
in gold digger and then also dreamchaser
man these are some awesome palettes and
this highlight in the gold digger
palette is insane it is insane it is
such a pigmented amazing highlight like
it is it is is no joke and then the
eyeshadows in the other palette I reach
for do so much because there's beautiful
neutral Browns but these posts are super
cute because they have a mirror and they
have a little band of that pops up here
I take these with me so often you saw
them in my travel makeup bag video I
love these men constantly recommending
them and I feel like I don't see anybody
talking about them but Pierre has been a
brand that I have been purchasing from
like I said since my college is which
was not recently and just one that I
continue to recommend I recommended to
follow them on snapchat here has been a
brand that I've been loyal to a for over
ten years and so yes definitely had
mentioned at Pierre in this video I
guess nothing to do it for Moran so that
I am currently loyal to I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video or
found it helpful or entertaining in some
way I really wanted to choose the brands
that I have purchased a lot from myself
I am getting more PR recently and I have
you know some of my collections from
brands that are getting bigger and
bigger but it's because I've been
getting sent PR and I really wanted to
share the brands that I personally have
gone out and bought and recommended and
you know been buying from for years like
what I said was pure I mean I purchased
my first item from Pierre over 10 years
ago and I'm still loyal to the brand
today so those are the brands that I
really wanted to focus on in this video
but I really hope that you guys enjoy it
I would love to know some of the brands
that you are currently a loyal to right
now as well so leave me some comments
down below and let me know some of those
if you guys did enjoy this video I hope
that you will give it a thumbs up I hope
that you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I'll catch you guys
real soon in my next one
