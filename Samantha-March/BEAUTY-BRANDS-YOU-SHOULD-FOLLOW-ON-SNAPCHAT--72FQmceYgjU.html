today's video is going to be a little
bit different I'm going to be talking
about some beauty brands that I think
you should be following on snapchat got
this idea because I was going through my
snapchat and I realized whenever a
certain brand or a certain couple brands
and post I get really really excited
about their snapchat their takeovers
maybe or just their information that we
share with us across their snapchat so I
thought it could be a fun video to share
with you guys let you know who I love to
follow on snapchat I believe I have at
six different brands that I will run
through quickly and let you know why I
think you should be following them on
snapchat if you are not already I am
posting a video every single day right
now so I'm always trying to come up with
new ideas and new content to share on my
channel but if you guys do have any
other video ideas always let me know in
the comments down below because those
really do help me out if you do enjoy
giving a daily content on makeup and
beauty I hope that you will consider
hitting the subscribe button before you
go but when we go ahead and jump into my
six brains I think that you should be
following on snapchat first up is
actually the newest brand that I started
following on snapchat which is sigma
beauty i believe their handle is sigma
beauty but i will put all their snap
names right here on the screen and they
will also all be listed down below in
case that you do want to add them but
i'm just looking at my phone and it just
says sigma beauty i just recently within
the past couple weeks actually added
them to my snapchat and i don't know why
because sigma is one of my favorite
brands i don't know if i've just never
really heard anything else across their
social medias like follow us on snapchat
for this information or this takeover
i'm really not sure what it is but once
i start following the house like ding I
wish I would've been doing that sooner
I'm actually a Sigma affiliate so that
kind of like maybe even more bummed out
at myself that I hadn't been following
them sooner but yes I do think Sigma
Beauty is a really good one it to follow
on snapchat they have some good
information on there they always list
when they are having their deals and
Sigma always have a ton of deals and
promotions going on and sometimes your
Instagram feed I mean you never really
know what's going to come up on your
Instagram feed am i right like sometimes
I get things from so close it a week ago
and I'm like really why are they showing
up at the top of my bead Twitter could
kind of be the same way om you start it
on Facebook and I see them talking about
their deals promotions specials on their
snapchat and I think oh my gosh okay now
I can share this information as well
across my social media so that's why I
think the Sigma snapchat is really good
for it in particular so if you really
enjoy Sigma and that you
love getting deals I would say add them
to your snapchat because that way I feel
like you are pretty much not going to
miss the deal as long as you're checking
your snapchat it can get lost in your
other social media feeds but they always
announce it over there on their snapchat
so stigma beauty is definitely one that
I would recommend that you follow on
your thumb so next up is not so much a
brand but you know it's like our
motherboard Sephora I did not know
Sephora had a snapchat as well until
maybe the last like month or so I want
to say so I added Sephora I believe
they're just Sephora again that will be
in the description box down below I
really do like the Sephora snapchat as
well because whenever they're having any
sort of like event or party with any of
what the brands that sell in Sephora is
always a snapchatting gift and I think
that's really fun because you kind of
get a behind-the-scenes they were having
a party just this week and I know I've
only list the owners of dr. roebucks
skincare was on there chatting and I
just recently started trying out their
skincare so that was really fun to see
so they have some signs behind the
scenes they have some fun behind the
scenes like at the store as well or
setting up displays or when new products
come in they will put them on their
snapchat kind of fun to follow along
Sephora like I said I did not know until
very recently that they have snapchat so
maybe some of you don't know that they
have snapchat either and I would
recommend adding Sephora to snap so next
up for your session I want to recommend
pure cosmetics they're pure cosmetics on
snapchat I have been following pierre
for a very long time they were one I
think one of the first makeup brand that
I started all in on snapchat
I love Pierre I've been to your
collection videos I wear a lot of Pierre
I recommend a lot of here I just really
enjoyed their products and I really
enjoy their snapchat as well they always
have really really good takeovers on
their their influence or takeovers are
so much fun and I like that we get a
variety of different takeovers from the
pure snapchat you get your straight
beauty bloggers on there doing the
makeup tutorials and I don't also seem
bloggers on there doing fitness as well
as makeup and I think that's a lot of
fun so I feel like they have a really
nice diversity with their snapchat
takeovers which I really do appreciate
and then as well in addition to their
takeovers they have really good
information about their products when
they're coming out with new products
it's watching the new products you know
the gals that regularly runs our
snapchat
are doing tutorials on them as well and
then all of their other products as well
not just their new releases but it's
always nice to see kind of like the
regular girls Ilona
believe is one of them she's always on
there and she does a lot of tutorials in
my skincare videos as well which I
appreciate so I really enjoy watching
Pierre
maybe one day I'll get to take over from
pure cosmetic snapchat that would be
crazy but I feel like their influence or
takeaways are really really good I
definitely recommend pur cosmetics the
next brands that I want to recommend for
your snapchat is Benefit Cosmetics I
believe they are benefit Beauty on
snapchat I also have been following
benefit for a very long time I really
enjoyed benefit I wear a lot of benefit
every single day in particular their
brow products I have their precise on my
brow on right now and I've just been
fine from benefit for a very long time
they're one of the first like more
high-end makeup brands that I started
getting into when I started shopping at
like Sephora and Ulta I really like them
because I feel like the gals who runs
our snapchat are very informational
there's ginger there used to be stuff
but I don't see her as much I know there
is a new girl now Ginger's always on
there a lot too and they do a lot of
tutorials they do a lot of like how - I
feel like gingers always on there
explaining how to do different broad
techniques and a lot of times I have
rewatched their snapchat stories to try
to learn so you guys know I'm not a
Braille person myself but I have
rewatched their snap stories to try to
learn and pick up the information that
they're giving in their snapchat so I
feel like they are really good at
snapchat for demonstrating their
products explaining how to use their
products and then actually showing how
to use their products as well I also
really enjoy their I think his name is
Jared he's on there from time to time
analogy it's just so like funny and out
there but he's also really good at
explaining about brows and brow products
things like that so of course they also
do talk about their other makeup on
there whenever they're having new
releases I know they're just released a
new concealer they're on there they're
explaining it how to get it I feel like
they're very interactive with our
snapchat as well but I was taking
snapchat questions I was just watching
last night they were talking about
benefit boutiques and people were coming
into their Instagram and asking question
and the gal was showing it right there
you know saying the Instagram name and
then answering the questions and giving
information so I feel like they are very
interactive with their audience as well
which is very cool and benefit is
another brand that it runs a lot of like
giveaways contests promotions and
specials things like that and if they
get lost on your other social media
feeds you can always find them on your
have chat cell benefit cosmetics or
benefit Beauty is one that I would
suggest as well for your snapchat trying
to get through these as quickly as I can
because I'm filming super super late
I've had a ton of left-half problems
today so I'm filming at 5:30 and I
normally film at like 1 to 2 o'clock so
it's a little stressful so I'm trying to
beat it I don't have crazy shadows along
my face but trying to get through this
as quickly as I can but the next brand
that I would recommend for your snapchat
is Maybelline Maybelline has been they
were you know probably one of those very
first brands that I really started
wearing and I'm talking back in my high
school that is still when I first
started my youtube channel I was buying
a ton of a blank I couldn't really
afford a lot of high-end yet but that
was never a problem for me because I
loved the Maybelline brand so much I
owned a ton of Maybelline and I often am
recommending certain items from
Maybelline I also do really love their
snapchat they have a really good
influence of takeovers also are very
good at demonstrating the product
talking about new releases talking about
any specials I feel like they're very
interactive as well right now I think
they just wrapped up with their
maybelline road trip or it might be
going on again in a couple weeks or so
but they were actually going around like
the New York and New Jersey area I think
they were in and maybe a couple other
places and they were basically having
like these small get-togethers it's
almost in like a park and people could
come and they were giving away free
Maybelline makeup and you know
explaining and demonstrating the
products and things like that I thought
that was really cool and I'm just very
confused by no one does that in Iowa you
know like what why are no the brand's
coming to Iowa very confused about that
I just think that was very cool very
interactive and right now they're having
like an influencer party thing happening
out in the Hamptons but we're getting a
lot of those snaps as well and we're
seeing you know kind of the behind the
scenes of those parties I know there's a
big giveaway along with that they are
just another brand that I really enjoyed
watching whenever I see their names pop
up on my story feed I click on them
right away because I feel like I'm
either going to learn something from
them I'm going to hear about a new
product or I'm going to be entertained
so I really enjoy Maybelline and would
suggest it for your steps and then the
final brand that I want to recommend is
Tarte cosmetics with their Tarte
cosmetics on snapchat I really love
following Tarte I wasn't doing this in
any particular order but this might be
my favorite brand actually to follow on
snapchat I really like all of them that
I've mentioned out
if I'm recommending them but part really
might be one of my favorite they have
amazing influence or takeovers I really
enjoy watching their takeovers but I
really like the gals that they have on
their snapchat there is Jen there is
deanna deanna just got married
Jen's pregnant leave right is Li the
other one and Lee is pregnant too and
Deanna just got married I think I have
that correctly but literally I watched
them on snapchat so much I feel like I
know them because these are not the
influencers these are you know target
employees and they are just kind of like
the face at their snapchat but I feel
like they are all very personable I
really enjoy watching all three of these
gals on snapchats they have a few other
ones as well but I think those three are
like their main ones and it was so funny
just like Deanna got married when I was
super excited for her now two of the
gals are pregnant I'm like oh my gosh
yay they did like their gender reveals
on snapchat and I was so excited to
watch it so it's funny because you know
of course we're learning about cars
they're always doing tutorials on there
they're always explain their products
always using their products at the same
time it's also like on a personal level
as well which I think that's one of the
reasons why I love Tarte we love being
able to relate people we love to fall in
love with someone's personality we
really do so I think that's a big thing
that sets heart apart and I think those
three gals I'll really have a lot to do
with it but I definitely do enjoy
watching Tarte snapchat for them but
also like I said they are constantly
using the products their composition new
ways to use the product explaining how
to use the products they have really
good in-depth tutorials but they also
just do a lot of different fun things on
to delts on there the other day we're
taking a road trip and they took us
along on the road trip and you know what
Tarte products they put on their face
during their road trip
they just do fun different things like
that but I don't see from a lot of other
brands on snapchat I feel like they
really put a lot of time and effort and
thought into their snapchat which I
appreciate a lot of someone who watch it
always watch the Tarte snapchat I get
excited when they come up in my story
there's another brand I feel like run
specials a lot so they're always talking
about the deals over there and like
their snapchat is always pop and like
they always have something going on like
very rarely a day where you're not
getting a snapchat or something from
Tarte as well so I just I really like
their snapchat I would HIGHLY
I only recommend if you enjoy tart as a
brand especially I would recommend to
check them out because they always have
good tutorials tips in there and then I
just think it's a fun snapchat on top of
that so it's heart is going to be my
sixth and final brand that I'm going to
recommend for your snapchat
I guess allows you to do it for the six
brands that I think that you should
follow on snapchat
I was left know in the comments down
below what brands that I mentioned to do
you follow and do you enjoy following
them or what brands do you follow that I
didn't mention that maybe I should be
following again this isn't all of the
beauty brands that I follow up with
there's actually quite a few brands that
I do follow and I like sometimes I just
skip over that stories but I would love
to know what you guys would recommend
for me because I'm on snapchat all day
long and of course you should also
follow me on snapchat

that link down below I'm on snapchat all

interactive over there I always have

snapchat as well so I hope that you'll
