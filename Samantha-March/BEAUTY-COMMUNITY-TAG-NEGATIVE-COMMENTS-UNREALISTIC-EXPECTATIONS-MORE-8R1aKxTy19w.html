today's video is going to be a new tag
video this is the beauty community tag
and this tag was started by my friend
Lisa Stevens here on YouTube I'll have
her Channel and her original beauty
community tag a link down below she did
tagged me on this video which I was
super excited about I wanted to do more
tag videos on my channel I recently did
the 2017 YouTube rewind tag and kind of
mentioned in there that I think tags
could be making a bit of a comeback and
I want to do them some more on my
channel and I definitely wanted to do
the beauty community tag so if you'd
like to know my thoughts I have 10
questions to answer let's go ahead and
jump into it okay so the first question
is what are your favorite videos to
watch my favorite videos to watch I did
also recently do a video on this my
favorite and least favorite videos to
watch I don't leave that video linked
down below because I do chat like more
in depth about it but some of my
favorite videos to watch I mentioned
that I really love tutorials I got asked
a lot of questions of who I really like
to watch for tutorials I definitely
loved Babs Beauty she's one of like my
all-time favorites for tutorials I also
I really love watching that girl Shae XO
her tutorials are just they're just
something different and her vibes are
just a little bit more unique when it
comes to makeup and it kind of pushes me
out of my comfort zone so I love
following her tutorials as well and then
also like desi Perkins I love her
tutorials at Jamie Genevieve I really
enjoy her tutorials as well so those are
a few of my favorite two channels to
watch for tutorials so so I love
tutorials but I also love watching
reviews like I'm such a review junkie I
love doing reviews myself but I love
watching reviews and hauls I mentioned
that I love watching makeup monthly is I
also just really enjoy watching unique
content on YouTube and I explain that
kind of further in into the video and
you know I feel like a lot of my friends
here on YouTube we kind of have the same
style and the same like vibes and taste
and we we enjoy coming up with a
different kind of content like this tag
video here it's just always fun in the
morning to go on and see what's being
uploaded and what people are coming up
with I think it's really cool and I
think it's a fun shift in YouTube right
now so those are some of my favorites
but again I'll have that video linked
down below where I kind of talk a little
bit further about it
question number two is what are some of
your favorite videos to film my favorite
type of videos to film are definitely
ones like this ride is
to sit down and talk I'm not a tutorial
based Channel sometimes like one or two
times a month I'll do some sort of like
get ready with me or a first impression
video I get requested a lot for
tutorials and things like that but
they're just not really my favorite to
do but I kind of compromise doing one to
two a month which I film I upload almost
every single day so let's you know one
or two videos out of 30 videos I still
think that's pretty good and I'm finding
myself and joined them more and being a
little bit more comfortable with them
but I also I like to be able to show how
I apply makeup or you know showing how
makeup applies I do think that is also
something that's important so I never
will label anything like this kind of
tutorial that kind of tutorial because I
really don't feel like I'm ever doing a
tutorial I'm not teaching I'm just kind
of like sitting here in my office in my
messy office showing you guys how I'm
putting makeup on but other than that I
just like the videos where I get to sit
down and chat I get a chat about what
makeup is coming out they're like what's
new and makeup and what I'm gonna buy
which is like my will i buy it serious
that I've been doing for a very long
time now and I just love doing but yeah
just being able to sit down and talk
about makeup those are just my favorite
videos to film I really enjoy them and
then question number three is what are
your at least favorite videos to watch
again I've mentioned that in my favorite
and least favorite videos to watch I
don't really like I feel like one of the
biggest things I mentioned in there was
I don't like being misled by videos I
don't like being told that someone's
going to review a product in a video and
I click on it because I want to get the
review and it's really just a first
impression or they tell me well I've
tried this once and I'm gonna review it
it's just those types of videos just
have really turned me off lately and
kind of like the the clickbait style and
all of that it just it's it's just
really not my favorite to watch so those
are some ones like my least favorites to
watch yeah like I said I'll have that be
linked down below I chat more about I
think that's like a 20 minute video now
it's a pretty recent video so I didn't
want to be too repetitive in this one
but yeah those aren't do is my favorite
to watch let's see number four is what
is your favorite part of the beauty
community I think my favorite part of
the beauty community is
being a community I don't know if that
makes sense but it's it's being able to
know that every single day I get to talk
to not just one person I get to talk to
so many people whether it's in the
YouTube comments whether it's over on
Instagram it's on Twitter it's on my
snapchat I get to talk to so many people
and it's such a bright part of my day
and I appreciate it so much I've talked
before in past videos that I started
YouTube out of very low time in my life
and I just I needed I I needed something
to be able to to focus my energies on
because what I was focusing on was
negatives and how bad everything sucked
and how life wasn't going the way I
wanted to and I wasn't able to focus on
something positive so starting a YouTube
channel really gave me an outlet for for
positivity and I am a creative person if
you are newer to my channel I'm a
published author I have five published
novels so I am creative in that sort of
sense I'm not very like artistically
creative which plays into me not doing
tutorials and I learned everything about
how to apply makeup from YouTube so I'm
not artistically creative but I am a
creative person and having a YouTube
channel allowed me to tap into that
creativity really been a huge part of
you know having so much more positivity
in my life but then when it comes to the
community it's really really so cool to
get accepted into this community and not
just by the other YouTube creators but
by the people who come and watch the
videos and support and the subscribers
and the followers like it's really
amazing to see that on a daily basis
really it's been it's been such a
positive impact in my life it's been so
very cool so the community aspect of the
beauty community is something that I
absolutely love and do not take for
granted question number five is what is
your least favorite part of the beauty
community I think my least favorite part
of the beauty community I don't know how
I don't know if I would be able to like
pinpoint one thing but I think one thing
that gets me really frustrated about the
beauty community
how much how much pressure Beauty
youtubers get put on them times it's
just hard for me to see the pressures
the comments and the the the thought
process of some people who watch YouTube
videos it's very strange to me you know
being a youtuber all of a sudden I have
too much makeup I don't have enough
makeup I wear too much makeup I don't
wear enough makeup I know why there's
not more acceptance I guess is what I'm
saying you know I I wear a makeup look
and someone says well I don't like that
makeup look on you what how is that
helpful how is that I'm sorry that you
don't like one makeup look I did I do 30
makeup looks a month on YouTube like no
you're not gonna like every single one
of them I don't like every single one of
them but it's such like just the the
rude comments that people think that
they can say and that they're okay
saying online is really horrifying to me
I have never once in my life ever left a
negative comment on someone's video
someone's channel nothing I can never
imagine doing that because that is
cyberbullying and like I don't care if
someone's like well all I said was that
I didn't like their makeup still
cyberbullying and guess what I bet you
said something worse and if you didn't
say something worse of that person I bet
you said something worse to another
person it's cyber bullying so cyber
bullying that would be my least favorite
part of the beauty community and I get
it every single day someone left me to
comment the other day I was wearing hair
extensions in a video and they said oh
your hair looks really nice usually
usually it just looks long and stringy
and gross so good job hair looks good
today are you kidding me are you kidding
me
you would walk up to someone and you
would say that someone really and it's
just interesting because you get
comments like that you're like wow and
people wonder why do people wear hair
extensions why do people have fake nails
why do people do this but because that's
that's the kind of comments we get
that's kind of feedback we get from
people like really you question it I
want to wear hair extensions every
single day now in every single video
because I got so many great compliments
on my hair I don't have nice hair I've
destroyed my hair if I'm starting to dye
it when I was like 14 years old or
something like my hair is completely
fried it's done it's done for but I'm
not gonna clip in extensions every day
it's fun to do and it's it's fun to like
jazz up a look this is me like this is
me
this is my hair and to to get cyber
bullied or something as silly as hair
you know I had a comment one day oh just
not sure if you know this but your teeth
are crooked you should probably consider
Invisalign I had no idea my teeth were
crooked
my dentist has never told me I have
never looked in a mirror so I didn't
know that but thank you so much
yes I'm saving for Invisalign I've been
saving for Invisalign since before I got
married maybe one day I'll be able to
afford it maybe I won't be able to
afford it but really it's I'm Way off on
a tangent now but definitely
cyberbullying is my least favorite part
of the beauty community is the
unrealistic expectations that people put
on beauty bloggers as well would
probably be a very close second and kind
of like what I was going with that first
just crazy because like some of the
comments are I have to buy all of the
makeup you know I can't get anything in
PR I can't get anything gift it's me I
can't return any makeup because if I
talking about returning make it people
tell me how terrible terrible of a
person I am at the same time I also have
to do YouTube for free I usually put at
least one ad in my videos usually around
the halfway mark I will put in an ad so
the other an ad will pop up or the video
will go to a commercial that helps me
make money so I can continue to do this
but I get comments so often of you need
to stop putting commercials in your
videos you should you shouldn't monetize
your videos at all you know definitely
shouldn't do sponsored videos and you
know I should not be able to make an
income from posting a YouTube video 30
days out of the month I should not be
able to make money for that but I also
need to have the best camera I need to
have the best lighting I need out the
best backdrops I need to have all of the
makeup I need of our hair extensions
every single day if I can't even make
$10 off a YouTube channel a month like
I'm just very curious about this so
unrealistic expectations and
cyber-bullying
there to part-to-part I'm done rant over
boom moving on so question number six is
what motivated you to start your channel
I kind of mentioned that a little bit
earlier just needing a some sort of
different outlet in my life I really
didn't need that I started my channel
actually originally as more of a book
channel like I mentioned I'm a published
author I'm also a book blogger and I do
a bunch of reviews on my blog chicklet
plus
and so I thought maybe having a YouTube
channel could be an extension of that
but I always wanted to bring in the
beauty side as well when I started
chocolate plus in 2009 it was just kind
of coined as I women's lifestyle blog
and I did a bunch of different things on
there from books to beauty celebrities
Fitness fashion things like that and
over time it kind of just turned into a
book blog and I always wanted to bring
in this other side to me and something
else that I was always super passionate
about and that was kind of my hope with
the YouTube channel and then I got
nervous because you know it was gonna be
a new terrain for me so I was like I
don't know so I kept putting the book
stuff in here and like I would throw in
a beauty video like do people like this
would people watch an author sitting in
Iowa talking about makeup I don't know
and like I said feeling that sense of
community I got that right away when I
started my channel and it was really
amazing and the beauty videos really
took off over here and over the course
of the first few months that I was on
YouTube I actually changed to you know
solely the beauty channel and I still
have my book blog and that is now all a
book blog over there instead of
incorporating any sort of beauty or
fashion or like fitness or anything like
that onto my blog I keep that solely for
like YouTube and Instagram and that sort
of thing so it's a really nice balance
now and I finally found the balance that
I was always looking for between my two
worlds of books and beauty next question
we are on number seven is who inspires
you on YouTube and I don't think I would
be able to name a specific person that
inspires me on YouTube I have so many
great friends other YouTube creators and
also subscribers who I definitely
consider my friends as well as my
friends and who are YouTube creators I
feel like they inspire me because they
inspire me to keep pushing and to keep
coming up with creative things in my
twenty seventeen YouTube rewind tag I
list off a whole bunch of other channels
that I really love who I consider my
friends and I mentioned how they inspire
me to keep coming up with great ideas
like my friend Lisa who started this
type hour me to just keep coming up with
good ideas to to not just ever kind of
just sit back and be like you know
because my channel has grown I mentioned
again and the rewind type that I was
talking about a video that I posted in
March which was my 15k subscribers
giveaway and
and now over 40,000 which is so exciting
it's amazing to see growth when you know
when you're trying something you you
don't know for sure is this going to
work are people gonna watch my videos
are people gonna be able to connect with
me and when you see that it is happening
it's super exciting but I also think it
could be easy to just kind of like kind
of like sit back and be like oh well
good channels growing so I'll just keep
doing the same thing and the same thing
and I'll do what everybody else does and
I'll you know just kind of sit back and
relax and they really inspire me to keep
pushing and to keep coming up with ideas
and if I have a unique idea even if I
there's been a lot of unique video ideas
that I have done that I'm like I'm not
sure if anyone's even gonna watch this
video rather than you know are other
people gonna make this video I don't
know I don't know if anyone's gonna be
interested in this but they kind of like
give me back that courage that I can do
it so I think that's really cool and
really inspiring so they definitely they
definitely inspire me a lot and I just
feel really lucky that I can consider so
many people a friend of mine I think
that's really cool and really really
special for eight number one thing you
would change about the YouTube beauty
community I think one thing that I would
like to see change is is videos tearing
other beauty bloggers down I feel like
that's almost like a cool thing to do
right now I kept getting tagged on how
do I can't even remember whose channel
was I probably once iodine it was but I
mean I was getting tagged to watch this
video about why all beauty bloggers are
bad people and it was from a fellow
beauty blogger and I'm like why are you
attacking your own community I feel like
I see so many videos like this with
whether it be click buddy titles or not
I don't know because I don't click on
those videos I don't care to watch them
I don't care to watch another beauty
blogger tear down other beauty bloggers
that's so it's so disheartening to see
that and unfortunately I keep seeing
these videos pop up and I keep being
told hey you should go watch this video
and and I'm like why to watch people in
the same industry in the same profession
the people who do the same things making
an entire video tearing down other
people that's so disheartening that's
really sad to watch and I really hope
that that
and I hope that I hope that does not
stick around I don't even want to call
it a trend but seeing those type of
videos I hope I do not see those keep
popping up in my in my feets to watch
like I hope people don't keep telling me
oh you should watch this video about
another another person bashing beauty
bloggers who is a beauty blogger I'm
like why how does that even make any
sense what like I I know I understand
people make mistakes people do dumb
things but a lot of times there are
definitely serious mistakes that happen
but sometimes mistakes that people are
calling people out for are so insane to
me and and are so tiny and the grand
scheme of things that I'm like are we I
feel like people just are looking to
find people making a mistake or
something and I just I'm over that I
hope we can hope we can leave that
behind nine is what is your number one
advice for other creators are new people
starting out a channel my best piece of
advice I feel like a lot of people say
this but would be just to do it I wanted
to start a YouTube channel for a very
long time and I was always very scared
about it it is a very scary thing it was
very hard I remember the first youtube
video I was trying to edit and I didn't
even have an editing program yet I was
using the YouTube video editor which I
don't think is around anymore which is
really sad because it was free which was
awesome when I was trying to figure out
how to edit a video and I couldn't get
it and I was like an hour late to a
party that I had to go to and I was so
frustrated about it one of my friends
there like when I got to the party cuz I
just gave up and I went to the party and
a friend asked me how I was doing I was
like I can't figure out video editing
okay like I'm stupid I don't know how to
do this I don't know what I'm doing I
don't know why I got this idea I don't
know why I filmed this video I was so
frustrated and just like went off on her
and she was like angry or true like
please like I was super frustrated but
just know that it's scary but if you are
thinking about starting it you have to
at least try it it might not work out
for you I know I know not a lot of
people but I know a handful of people
who have started YouTube and have
thought this is what they wanted to do
and when they started they're like you
know what I actually don't like this I
thought I've wanted to do a lot of
things in my life and I've tried a lot
of different things and realize
actually that doesn't work out for me
but as long as you try it at least you
know if it works for you you could end
up falling in love with it and wanting
to make a go of it and I would also
suggest don't put crazy pressures on
yourself right away I just feel like I
hear way too many people become so
concerned about everything number wise
whether it's the views on their videos
or their number of subscribers and it
just makes me really sad when I see that
I get messages from other people like
you know I just posted my first youtube
video and only two people have seen it
and I'm like well that's your first
video like I don't even know how many
views my first video has but it wasn't a
lot and I was also coming from a social
media background I already had a
platform I already had thousands of
Twitter followers when I started my
youtube channel like it wasn't easy for
me by any means but I already had an
audience that I was like hey guess what
now I'm doing YouTube come follow me
over there that's cool a lot of people
who start a youtube channel are not
starting with that and I think that they
forget and they constantly measure
themselves up to other people we are all
so different with what we do and it just
makes me really sad when I see that so
just don't get bogged down by stuff like
that if you want to do a YouTube channel
and you want to make videos it should be
because that's what you want to do there
really should be no other reason for it
so I think that if it's what you want to
do you'll find that you get kind of like
addicted to filming videos and other
things kind of fall by the wayside
I challenged myself last summer to do a
daily upload I was already uploading
like three or four times a day but I was
like I want to see if I can upload daily
and truly it became addicting and now I
upload every single day I love it I love
being able to film I love when I'm
having a hard time I know that I can sit
down in front of a camera and it's going
to cheer me up so fast it's it's a
really cool feeling so those are some of
my tips ten is what do you love about
YouTube as a whole what I love about
YouTube as a whole is kind of kind of
what I've been saying I love the sense
of community I love the friendships that
I've made with other creators with other
subscribers I love being able to look
forward to going to work every single
day I know that is not something a lot
of people can say and it just makes me
so entirely grateful that I was so
accepted by a community and by so many
others and I was
able to form these wonderful and amazing
connections that is so freakin cool to
me but also another thing I love is
YouTube as a whole is me being a
subscriber and me getting to watch these
videos I think that I really love about
YouTube is that it's kind of like my
escape I don't really watch TV and I
don't really watch movies but I have all
of these super fun videos that I can
just kind of get lost in now I learned
I'm completely self-taught with makeup
through YouTube tutorials which has been
awesome because I never really felt like
I could get the hang of makeup now if
he's so frustrated cuz I've go out by it
and I would be so excited and I'd want
to create like the looks that I would
see from people on TV and I just
couldn't do it and so finding YouTube
that's definitely something that I've
really loved about it but yeah it's just
I think it's a fun place most of the
time I mean there's definitely good and
bad and everything out there in every
single industry but for me as a whole
about YouTube there's so many good
things and there's so many positive
things and that's what I try to focus on
when the bad things start happening but
I love it not only as a YouTube creator
but I also love it as a Youtube
subscriber so after the tenth and final
question that is it for the beauty
community tag okay so that is it for
today's video I really hope you enjoyed
seeing at the beauty community tag and
all of my questions I feel like this
video kind of got a little long it's not
boy but when I'm really passionate about
something I just kind of tend to go on a
roll there but I hope that you guys
enjoyed seeing in and of course make
sure to check out at least the Stevens
channel as well it will be linked in the
description box of course but if you
guys did enjoy seeing this I hope that
you'll give this video a thumbs up I
hope that you will also consider
subscribing before you go and I will
catch you guys in at tomorrow's video
