today's video is finally going to be an
empties video because my trashcan
obviously can't take it anymore I have
not done in empties and at quite some
time so today I'm gonna be taking you
through all the products that I used up
or decided to get rid of for my
collection and that sort of thing so if
you are ready for a new empties video
when we go ahead and jump into it like I
said it has been a while my trashcan is
so full that I actually was like placing
items next to the trashcan and that's
when I was like girlfriend you just need
to do an empties video like what are you
doing and then the last time I did an
empty one it was a live chat and I
actually asked on Twitter if you'd want
to see another live chat doing an
empties video but the majority people
said no I know a lot of people when
asking if I'm gonna do live chats again
but the feedback that I get when I ask
about live chats is that it seems like
people don't really want to see them
they would rather see regular video
content so that's what I'm doing cuz I I
know I asked about it on my snapchat as
well about possibly taking away live
chats to do extra content so I can do
collabs with more creators and things
like that and most everybody said like
very much majority wise and said no to
the live chat so just thought I'd throw
it out there cuz I know I get comments
sometimes about if I'm doing live chats
again but I don't have anything planned
as of right now but anyways jumping into
it okay so a couple items on top here I
see actually from my skincare project
pan video at the Pacifica seafoam
complete face wash I know was in there
the first aid Beauty ultra Repair hydro
firm sleeping cream was in that project
pan I see some other ones I'm that weird
like youtuber that even if I share
something that is emptied in a video or
decluttered I still put it in my empties
trash bin so that I can share about it
again is that just like a youtuber might
what is that what is that um the
botanics hydrating day cream this was
one I really did like the first two
items I talked about this is when I
wouldn't repurchase I ended up not
enjoying that one very much and I didn't
get all of the way done because I was
just like I don't really like this
anymore
they totally eye cream I wouldn't
repurchase this one that was a deluxe
sized sample I wouldn't get that again
and just I have other eye creams I like
better I know this one was in there as
well the Garnier skin active ultralift a
miracle wakeup cream I do like this one
a lot if you want a good drugstore like
hydrating moisturizer this one is
actually really good I do enjoy that one
the fresh soy face cleanser was in the
project pan and I really liked this one
as well I already have another deluxe
sized sample in my skincare collection
the number seven protect and perfect
advanced intense serum number seven has
some of my favorite serums I already
have this one in my collection as well
and then the Kate Somerville exfoli Kate
this is a very intense exfoliator I can
only use it once a week if that because
it is so intense but I do really like it
and I do think it works and I do have
another one in my collection so those
are a few of the items from my project
pan that I see on top here I also see
these are from a CVS it is the makeup
remover pads so fun story about these I
used to use the aimer makeup remover
pads and they are like in the exact same
packaging they even have the purple on
them that CVS and I went to grab the all
my ones and I don't know what happened
or how I managed to grab the CVS ones
because I could have sworn I was in the
all my section not the CVS Beauty
section but I somehow grabbed the CVS
ones and they were terrible I pretty
much only used like I wouldn't even use
them for actually removing my makeup I
would use them for like if I wanted to
clean up a wing or swatches are terrible
at actually removing makeup I was so mad
when I realized my mistake and that I
didn't purchase the only ones Oh
next up I have the skin fix a face
cleansing cloth I've gone through a
couple of these I know I got a package
from a skin fix and I actually I really
do like these the cloth was a good size
and it really took everything off I
don't use cleansing cloths a ton because
I prefer like a bomb or an oil to take
off my makeup but these these are pretty
good I know I've gone through a couple
of them let's see I have in here the
belief a moisturizing eye balm if this
was a 100-point perk so it was just a
little guy of it but I loved this so
much I was like scraping my fingernail
and they're like do I have any more left
this is really really nice but I know
the full size is more
so I would totally get a 100-point perk
again because I creams can last you well
you don't need a ton of product but this
one was really nice I really liked it I
would really like it back in my
collection and let's see I got a sample
here this is from igk it's the coconut
oil gel for your hair
honestly I use it a couple times and I
thought it really just like weighed down
my hair and made it like I have really
thin hair and very fine hair and
sometimes I talk about how I don't use a
ton of products in my hair because with
some products I feel like when I use
them my hair is just like even limper
than normal and just like hangs the I'm
like 90% dry shampoo today I don't mind
that but yeah this one I just I didn't
really like I didn't see it doing
anything besides making my hair look
kind of weird so so that one was kind of
a no-go for me next up I have this one
from Rodale or Road aisle skincare it's
the stem-cell cleansing cream I got this
in an Ipsy bag and I actually really
liked it I felt like I could like feel
something on my skin when I was using it
it was kind of like a thicker cleanser
and I just I really enjoyed it but I am
not sure where you can buy this now I
kind of want to look it up if I can find
it I like to link everything sometimes
with Indies videos it's really
challenging because it's a lot but I do
like to link everything but I'm gonna
try to find this and see where you
purchased us that because I remember I
ended up really enjoying that one one
item that I did not enjoy was this
boscia luminizing black mask
it's a peel-off mask this was so painful
I tried it two times and the second time
I tried it it took me a long time after
the first time to try it I was like that
hurt so bad I don't want to peel this
off but I was like no because I remember
talking about it on snapchat people are
like you have to play a really really
thick layer like don't apply it too thin
or something like that maybe it was even
vice versa now I don't remember maybe
they said I was too thick and I need to
apply it thinner I don't remember but I
did the opposite of what I did the first
time and I was like no still painful and
I'm not using in this again so I only
used it twice but I did not enjoy that
at all by I don't know I maybe my skin
is just too sensitive for a mass like
that but
that did not work out for me also in
here I have the glam glow thirsty mud
hydrating a treatment this is another
face mask and it supposed to be good for
hydrating of course I still have a
little bit left inside but honestly I
didn't feel like this did anything for
me glam glow is super expensive and this
is a sample guy of this one I don't even
know maybe it was a 100-point burg I
feel like I had it for a really long
time and I was just like I don't know if
it's doing anything so kind of just stop
using it and when I saw it on my
skincare drawer the other night I was
like just throw that away like you don't
use it there's other mass if I like a
lot more another especially a cheaper
because I think like a full-size of this
is like $69 or something and I don't
think that's worth it let's see I have
this
from it cosmetics it's the confidence in
an eye cream it's just a little sample
guy and I don't like it was okay but
what the sample I used it all up but I
was like I can't really tell from this
small of a sample if it actually did
anything so sometimes those samples you
can tell but sometimes if you only get a
couple uses it's like I don't know what
that just did if anything let's see I
have a lip balm in here this is from
Maybelline it's the Maybelline Baby Lips
this is a this this is an old guy I
think I took this out I always like to
have a lip balm in my like bathroom out
like sink in the juror before I go to
sleep if I have really dry lips I hate
going to bed with dry lips so this was
my lip balm up there for a while and it
is all gone I did like the baby lips for
quite some time I had like every single
color or shade or whatever you would
call it this one is crystal but I don't
think I would repurchase these anymore I
have other lip glosses or lip balms that
I like a lot better so that's kind of a
blast from the past also in here I have
the flower Beauty this is the elliptic
sculpt contouring palette I just
decluttered this one because it broke
and shattered and the bronzer shattered
and it kind of got the highlight all
icky and the blush is all icky and I'm
just gonna go ahead and repurchase
another one I was really bummed when
flower Beauty came to Ulta and this was
not on the Ulta website I was like this
was the one thing this is the sponge and
neither of them are on the Alta website
I'm like doing it those are the two
things that I want the most I'm still
holding out hope that it's going to come
back because I do want to repurchase
that one real bad let's see I have the
hoola hendrickson at Port balance facial
sauna scrub at this can
in a set of three minis and this was the
first one I used I fell in love with it
I already repurchased a full-size it was
mentioned in my last makeup haul I love
this one I feel like I've talked about
it a lot I've put it in favourites
videos I've repurchased it already love
that one I have another mascara from a
glam glow this is the gravity mud a
firming treatment again I just don't
feel like it did anything and I feel
like I only got like three uses out of
this guy and I didn't notice anything I
don't know do you guys love glam glow
like do you swear by them for me I've
tried a couple different ones and I just
couldn't get into the hype of them I
have my first sheet mask here I usually
have quite a few sheet masks this is
from petrology this is the milk peel
5-minute flash mask petrology has some
of my favourite masks and I really do
like this milk peel because it's more of
an exfoliating mask but it's good for
sensitive skin which I do have so I
enjoy using this one when I want some
deep exfoliation it's only 5 minutes
which i think is great my skin doesn't
look too red or irritated after I use
them which I really enjoy that I also
did declutter my pure 4 and 1 pressed
mineral makeup because I've have this
one open for a while I hit pan on it
it's it's been with me for quite some
time and I actually already do have
another backup in there so I think this
is when I did like my face powder
declutter i declutter this older one
since I already do have another one in
my collection but this is one of my
favorites like Holy Grail ride-or-die
I've been purchasing this for like over
10 years so I love that powder what can
I say let's see I have this should not
be in here this must have fallen into my
trash can off my desk this is kale
polish Aquarius you know you are not
being do not be thrown away put that
right back up I guess and next up I have
from dr. Brandt this is the oxygen
facial flash recovery mask this was one
I'm pretty sure this got sent to me from
actively like what am I like first ever
products that got sent to me after I got
accepted in octa leave and at first I
was like yeah this is super cool and
then I was like mmm I don't know and
then there's still a lot of product left
but I can't pump like the pump just
stopped working eventually and I was
like yeah you know what I don't think
I'm really all that into this and it's
like a really expensive mask off the top
of my head I want to say something like
$80 I can't I don't know I could be
making that up but I know it's an
expensive
ask it didn't last very long and I just
thought it was okay I would not
repurchase that one though I wasn't all
that impressed alrighty so I have some
concealers in here assuming this is from
my concealer declutter I have the NYX
sculpt and highlight to do out this was
a favorite at one point and then I
realized I don't think I love it as much
as I thought I did you don't get a lot
of product on either side so I actually
ended up going through it really really
quickly which was kind of a bummer
I liked the contour side more than the
concealers I didn't feel like the
concealer side actually concealed really
but I did like the more of the contour
side this is the Maybelline fit me
concealer I want to repurchase this one
of my favorite concealers I've been
buying the fitme concealer for years and
I love it and then this one is the
Maybelline a better skin a concealer I
know I feel like it looks like I could
be scraping it along the sides and trust
me like I was trying and I just can't
get any more product out of it but I
also really do like this concealer I
still think I like the yeah I like the
fit me about her so if I was gonna
repurchase
I would repurchase the fit me this is
the Rimmel stay matte translucent powder
I broke the cap to it and honestly I
have this guy for years I was saying in
my declutter video that I am so shocked
like I can tell there's a dent in it but
there should like I should have hit pan
on this guy it's crazy to me that I
haven't but I've had it for so long it
doesn't have a cap anymore I decided to
go ahead and declutter it but I do want
to repurchase it and it's super
inexpensive self efficient mask in here
this is from SNP this is the animal
outer sheet mask a for an aqua moisture
mask and I've been needing all the
moisture I can in this winter so it
doesn't shock me that I see the otter
mask there this one is from clean and
clear it's the deep action a cream
cleanser I've had this guy for so long
and I finally used it up it was one of
my favorites in college like I think I
repurchase this in college but I was
saying in my skincare project pan that I
feel like as I've gotten older like my
skincare is just gotten a little bit
more like my skincare is definitely
changed from what I needed it to do in
college from what I needed to do now
that I'm 30 so I wouldn't repurchase
that one but I did enjoy it in college
so in here I have from Estee Lauder this
is the brown multitasker I think I
mentioned this
in a makeup monthly and I put it in the
file section and I was like I'm just
gonna declutter it because I don't like
it I'm not gonna continue to use it it
has the pencil on one end and a spoolie
on the other and I liked it because in
the center you could pull it apart and
it had a brow powder and I liked the
powder but the actual pencil I didn't
love and I thought it was super waxy and
very hard to apply it's in the shade
blonde which I have blonde and some
pencils but this one was way too light
on me and just overall I did not love it
so I would not repurchase that guy I
have another mask in here this is from
an ugh Beauty I've been trying out there
mass recently and I really do like them
and this one is probably my favorite one
is too intensely hydrate and replenish
dried dehydrated skin so of course this
is what I'm loving as I'm super dry as
I'm staring outside watching it snow
again we're do 6 inches and it's still
snowing so it's fantastic I also inherit
from pixie and in collaboration with
Carolyn honks this is the double cleanse
that you get a solid cleansing oil on
one side which I love to remove my
makeup and then also a cleansing cream
on the other I love this guy and pixie
did send me another one of these and I
was so excited exciting down there on
this one so it's already back in my
collection I really really like this I
love the dual action it's just so easy
when I go for my skincare routine I
don't have to be like I'm gonna use this
and then that like pull this out boom
there we go so I really do like that guy
let's say I have some facial wipes these
are from Pacifica they're the very happy
cleansing wipes
I like these but they did have a very
strong scent to them which I don't
necessarily like putting especially
around my eyes I do have more sensitive
eyes so I didn't love how much of a
fragrance
these ones had I mostly just ended up
using them for swatches I just don't
like anything with too much of a
fragrance to go around my eye area these
are from ELF they're the active
post-workout cleansing body wipes again
I mostly just use these of her swatches
and stuff I know it says that you can
use them all over your body I don't
necessarily need that I do workout I do
workout every day I do about at my home
so I'm not like in a gym or anything
like that but still it's not it's not
necessary for me to do that if I need to
cleanse I'm just gonna do a body shower
and that's it but I used our first
watches and they were fine for that
these are my favorites makeup remover
wipes is still these are from Neutrogena
the
cleansing towelettes these are what I
use most frequently form actual face I
go traveling with these guys so I will
definitely want to repurchase them I
think I just mentioned them in my if I
had a 200 dollar gift card type of video
and I mentioned them on the affordable
side so I really do like them I have
another sheet mask here this is a this
is one of my favorites I think I only
have like two left of these and I'm
doing that thing about I'm hoarding them
like I don't want to use them on just
like a random occasion I want to really
know like this is the mass that I want
to reach for I just need to I just need
to make a purchase it just need to make
purchase Mantha this is from pathology
it's the smart mud no mess mud mask I
love mud masks there are some of my
favorite to use but I've never enjoyed
how messy they are so I love having that
in a sheet mask and I feel like it makes
my skin so freakin nice I do have a code
of pathology it's always in my
description box if you purchase off the
pathology site for a discount or you can
also get them at Ulta but I'm gonna here
I decided to declutter the Urban Decay
troublemaker mascara I used it a handful
of times I mean I'm gonna say probably
like six or seven times and I just
really didn't do anything for me and
mascara isn't something that usually res
my engine anyways because I always wear
false lashes or majority wise I wear
false lashes so when this just wasn't
really doing anything for length or
volume I was like mmm I'm not really
need to keep it around in my collection
so I decided to declutter that one
another mascara I have in here is from
julep this is the with a twist lash of
boosting a bamboo mascara this is a
really nice mascara I used it all the
way up and has a cool wand flower Beauty
has one similar to this where you kind
of twist it and I can get it's supposed
to do different things for length length
volume curl and things like that so you
can do that with the wand I really do
like this guy actually I don't think I
would repurchase it because I would
rather purchase the flower beauty which
I think it's cheaper but this was a good
one from julep next up this was from my
project pan as well this is the clean
and clear morning burst a facial
cleanser again
this was born that I repurchase many
times in college and like right post
college but for now it wouldn't be
something that I would repurchase but I
did use it up in my project pan I've two
primers here I recently added some new
primers that are really enjoyed to my
collection and where I store
my primers is getting a little bit out
of hand so I decided to let go of these
two because they are fairly older in my
collection this one is really really old
this is the Too Faced primed and
poreless skin and smoothing a face
primer this is one of like my original
face of primers and I really did like it
it's almost like a it's like a putty is
how I described it and I thought that it
filled in my pores really really well
but I have other primers now that I
don't think I would repurchase this one
and I don't even know if it's available
currently because it's quite a bit older
and this one is from Maybelline this is
their master prime blur and illuminate
primer I did like this one but again I
wouldn't repurchase it I thought it did
more illuminating than it did blurring
and I would like more blurring versus
illuminating so I wouldn't repurchase
that one but I decided to get rid of
those two so I could store some primer
so that I enjoy even more also that
appears to have fallen in my trash can
is post-it notes so I put those back on
my desk I don't want to get rid of my
post-it notes this one I know I
decluttered this is the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer I declared it
in my bronzer declutter because this one
is really old and I already have a
backup of it I do really like this
bronzer and I like it in my collection
but that one is older it could be tossed
I also have the Sigma gel liner the
wicked gel liner I was kind of
rearranging my bookshelf the other night
where I have some of my like gel liner
pots and I saw this one and I was like
girlfriend just get rid of this one
because I feel like I've brought it up
in past videos because I do like this
one when I wore gel liner a ton this was
like my go-to but I feel like every time
I mention it I'm like I just need to
declutter it it's so old it's mostly
dried out it's almost gone I can see the
bottom like I've hit pan on this one and
then I put it back in my collection I'm
like just declutter it I do not really
wear gel liners anymore like I said that
used to be my staple go to what I did
for liners but I really don't so even
though I like this one I would recommend
it if you like gel liners but for me I
want to repurchase it right now because
I just don't reach for those enough
anymore also in here I have the Tata
luminous dewy skin mist I just need to
pass this on to somebody I don't know I
don't need to throw this away because I
feel like there's yeah there's a good
amount here I gave it a bunch of
different shots but I know I've reviewed
this in maybe like a follow-up video or
something or maybe it wasn't makeup
monthly I don't remember but this just
makes my skin to do it's like the
weirdest thing because I've really dry
and when I started using it was before
we got like before my skin got super dry
and I actually held on to it I was like
I bet I'm going to get really dry in the
winter I'll pull this out and it's gonna
make me feel better but it almost just
makes me look to it I don't know if I
want to use the word greasy or what I
want to use but it's just not my
favorite but I gave it plenty of shots
but I feel like there's still a decent
amount of product in here so I'm gonna
just gonna I'm gonna hold that on for a
friend because I feel like someone could
still get some good use out of it it
just wasn't for me
I blush that I'm sure I probably
declutter dza from colour-pop but this
is quarters it's one of their super
shock cheeks this is like one of my
original purchases from colour-pop like
one of my very first orders it's very
very old and I barely reached for the
color pop of blushes anymore because
they're really similar to the super
shock shadows I just feel like they're
kind of hard to apply and just not my
favorite I might prefer just a plain at
powder blush also in here I have this is
a sample of the Chanel sold a tan
bronzer cream bronzer thing you know
what I'm saying I have a lot in here
left this was a little sample from when
a social while was still around and you
could get samples of high-end makeup and
kind of like a subscription box I still
have so much left in here I can see
where I kind of like started putting my
finger in it I can see like brushstrokes
in it but it just kind of wasn't it
wasn't really my jam and I've had this
for a very very long time so I wanted to
get rid of it but it just wasn't my fave
and I even put it out for a while like
remember to use it remember to keep
trying this I'm like I just don't really
like it and it's really expensive like a
full-size I don't even know how
expensive it is but it's expensive but
it didn't really do anything for me I'm
a mascara in here is the pure a fully
charged mascara I do like this mascara
but the pure oh there's another mascara
from Pierre that I really like I'm
looking at my mascaras but the mascaras
are behind my eyeliner
it's in a pink - can't remember what
it's called right now that's my favorite
pure mascara so I wouldn't repurchase
this one because I would repurchase the
other big lash big look big lash or big
look or something like that I think is
the pure one that I really like so I
would rather repurchase that one but
then as a pretty good mascara it does a
good things for length for your lashes
this is from soap &amp;amp; Glory it's the
mighty contour I use this in a first
impression video and I came back in and
said it really is not very good you get
like a cream a contour and a cream
highlight and a cream blush and I just
didn't really think they did much they
weren't super pigmented but they also
fade it really really fast on the skin
so I just went ahead and decluttered
that one I also declared the NYX and
matte bronzer mostly because this is
like one of my G bronzers it's super old
it's been very loved on and even though
it was one of like my favorite bronzers
for a while I realized that it's too
orange on me like now when I went to use
it like when I was trying to decide if I
should declutter this one or not and I
went to use that one day I was like not
your finest choice of bronzers I'm at
the of like that does not look good on
you lessons learned another sheet mask
in here is from a pathology it's the
flash mask a five-minute facial mask for
illumination I do like this one
but the hydrate one the one in the blue
I prefer that one over the illuminate I
just like to hydrate versus illuminate
what I'm saying but that one's pretty
good but not my favorite pathology one I
have a pair of lashings in here these
are from Pierre which lashes are these
all these are pure bombshell lashes I've
already repurchased these pure lashes
are my favorite we all know it I've gone
on to repurchase bombshell several times
but that pair we needed to call it quits
on the other color pop blush I have in
here is between the sheets again same
thing it's just really really old and
not my favorite to kind of blush so I
went ahead and got rid of that one and
then another blush is from Milani this
is a Dulce pink this is my first Milani
blush in here when I was decluttering my
blushes I decided to get rid of this one
and keep luminoso go so I prefer over
this one and I just don't reach for this
kind of like bright pink shimmery blush
as much
another sheet mask in here is from oh
I'm not sure how to say and this and
this free I'm not sure how to say the
brand but it's the real squeeze a
cucumber mask I have a couple more of
these that I would need to try out but I
believe this is a que Beauty mask I
don't really have a ton to say because
I've just use the one but I do have some
other ones that I can be trying out and
then I have two different liners in here
are these from NARS yeah these are the
NARS of velvet eyeliners I did not
really enjoy these I reviewed the NARS
like Holiday Collection when it came out
and I said like probably what I was the
least impressed with were these
eyeliners I just don't feel like they
did anything head and it decided to
declutter these when I was looking at my
expanding eyeliner collection one day
then I have some more facial wipes in
here these are from a Garnier they are
the skin active my seller makeup
removing a towelettes I actually really
do like these I ended up really enjoying
them I would probably repurchase these
actually I really did like them I like
them more than the micellar water to be
honest I probably repurchase these
actually I almost kind of forgot about
these I really do like them and I know I
brought him once we were like traveling
a bunch for my friend's wedding and like
bachelorette party and things like that
and I was letting the other girls use
them I know one of my friends went out
and bought them because she liked them
so much because I was one her I use them
at the hotel so I do like those I
decided I decided to declutter my sample
of my finchy Beauty foundation the like
pro filter foundation I got a sample of
it the pro filter soft matte long-wear
foundation I decided to get a sample of
it when it came out and I got the shade
at 210 and this just did not work well
for my skin it didn't sit well on my
skin it's more full coverage which isn't
my favorite I didn't think my shade
match was perfect it doesn't really do
much for me again it's just a little
sample guy but I got my I got my sample
worth I was able to see if it would work
for me and unfortunately it didn't I'm
hoping Fendi comes out with like a
luminous foundation or something because
that's kind of more my style and I would
totally try that but I had a feeling I
wouldn't get on with the foundation just
because of the reviews and like what the
claims are that's not would I lean
towards in a foundation but hey I still
want to give to try and I did but I'm
gonna go ahead and get rid of my sample
I haven't
here from cinema secrets this is the
makeup brush a cleaner so this is a
little jar and what I typically do is I
repurchase the bigger size this is for
cleaning your brushes but it's a quick
dry so you just kind of spray some on
the brush and then you rub it on a paper
towel and it'll take the pigment off the
brush but your brush will still be dry
it's not for like deep cleaning your
brushes or getting a bacteria off or
anything like that and what I do is I
purchase the bigger jugs of it and then
I actually pour it into here because I
can take this traveling that's just a
spray bottle but I've had this for so
long the spray no longer works on it so
I think I'm just gonna go ahead and
repurchase the spray size again and then
when I run out of it I have my refill
ready so I can just put it in here but
yeah I'm really bummed that the spray
doesn't work but this stuff is just
awesome I mean we can't deep clean our
brushes every single day so this is
really handy to have so have the benefit
that precisely my brow pencil I had
already repurchased this one so I have
one in my collection I use either the
shades 2 or 3 D I kind of go back and
forth but I love the precisely my brow
it's so good if my brows look crazy
today by the way it's because I ran out
of my brow pencil and the middle doing
my brows I was like what does one do
when that happens and I was gonna take
another bro pencil and like try to make
it work in the house like I'm probably
gonna screw it up and the colors are
gonna look weird and something's gonna
look wrong and you know if someone has
to tell me about my brows and every
single video anyway who knows my browser
crazy that's what happened I don't know
if ever had that happen before but the
precisely if my brow pencil is
definitely one of my favorites and like
I said I already did
repurchase this one reading to the
bottom so this was a while ago and then
we have the very last thing I see in
here is another pair of lashes and I
don't even know I don't even know what
these lashes are I bet they are Ardell I
bet they are Ardell like faux mink
lashes I tried them our delve did send
me a little package and I tried the faux
mink lashes and I did not like them at
all our doll lashes are just not my
favorite anymore which is super sad but
I remember these did not look so good on
me I tried them a couple times and then
I was like just just just no just just
go with the lashes that you know that
you love but after that does that is it
finally going to do it for everything in
my little trash can all of my beauty of
these I guess that's gonna be everything
for my new Beauty empties I will try to
be doing these more like I said I feel
like
what I did was probably like three
months ago and I know I can do them on a
more consistent basis if you guys do
like to see these on a more regular
basis do let me know or if you only need
to see them like two or three times a
year you know let me know in the
comments on what you think but those
were all of my recent Beauty empties I
hope that you enjoyed seeing that and
some of my thoughts on these products
and if I have repurchased them or if
they did not work out for me and as
always if you guys did enjoy this video
I hope that you'll give it a thumbs up I
hope that you will also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
