today's video is going to be a new
empties video I try to post my empties
video about once a month going through
everything that I have used up letting
you know my thoughts on them I also
usually do like very mini little D
clutters in my empties video I think I
have some sponges in here and maybe some
eyeliners and lashes too that I kind of
went through my collection and decided
to get rid of a few things so I have
those included in this video as well so
if you want to see as some of the
products that I've used up recently let
me go ahead and get started
already so right on top here I do have
two makeup sponges that I've decided
have ran their course this one here is
from Real Techniques no incorrect from
Ecotools and I really do like this
sponge I have another one actually so
it's a green sponge as you can see it's
kind of flat on both sides here one side
is like really long and flat the other
one is a little bit skinnier and like I
said I have another one of these and I
really do like these and they're more on
the affordable side this other one here
is the sponge from SL miss glam or SL
miss glam Beauty so Stephanie she is a
youtuber here as well and then she has
her own brand also and she mostly sells
makeup brushes which I have a few of my
collection also but then I also have
this sponge here I really really do like
this sponge I know it's a little bit
pricier though but I actually really
really like the sponge I like the light
pink color to it again it's kind of a
more traditional sponge like the L'Oreal
or the morphe
but it does have a little slanted edge
right here which I actually really do
like and it's nice and soft and I really
really do like this one actually
okay so also I have a sheet mask a
couple sheet masks no surprise
this one is from Pathology this is the
smart mud no mess mud mask a detoxing a
sheet mask I don't think there's ever
been an empties video that I'm not
talking about this this is one of my
hands down a favorite sheet mask I do it
every single week without fail it's a
mud mask but in a sheet mask so you have
less mess you know you're not getting
your sink completely filthy it's easy to
rinse off as well like you literally
just pull the mask off and throw it away
and there's just like a slight residue
left and you just rinse it and boom like
not ruining tells or anything it's great
I love these so yeah
see these a lot in my empties video
another sheet mask I have here is also
from pathology this is the hydrate mask
I remember I was using this when I was
still dealing with my dry patches I
could not get my dry patches to clear
out for the longest time so I kept using
the hydrating sheet mask as well because
it's great for just packing a ton of
hydration really quickly into your skin
so I also really like this one and it
does have hyaluronic acid in it too you
can find pathology on their website and
I do have a code with them for some
money off or you can also find them at
Ulta ok I also used up one of these guys
here this is just like the casing for it
but it's from Olay I'm not really sure
why I'm opening it because it's empty
these are the ones that hold do they
have the name on it they're the like
five and one cleansing cloths daily
facial cloths from Olay I've talked
about these a lot in like travel videos
and skincare videos and things like that
but they're just my favorite I've gone
through multiples of these boxes I don't
even really know how many but inside you
just get a dry cloth and then once you
get it wet it can be a makeup remover it
can be a scrub it can be a cleanser and
I love these especially for traveling
since they are dry it's super easy to
just throw them in your bag and I always
just pack however many I need for how
many nights I'm staying and that's what
I used to take my makeup off at night
and it really cleans your skin as well
so these are awesome and I just went
through another box ok so this had to be
pretty excited I got through another mac
fix+ I think this is maybe like my
second one that I got through I love the
fix plusses a ton and I actually have
this in my project pan my 18 and 20 18
which I think I have to do an update
here soon for that
I think but I'm excited because I
finished this but I'm that person that
once I start to get low on something I
stopped using it I'm like I don't want
to run out but I have backups of the
fix+ now so I'm like no you can do it
girlfriend
so I went through a fixed plus I will
always have these in my collection I
think they are fabulous it's what I used
to set my face today and I just love the
fix plus okay so next up I have another
product from Olay this is the Olay eyes
deep hydrating eye gel I do have another
one of these I mentioned this in my
makeup backup drawer that I wanted to
get another one
of these idols because I think that they
are so good is a really really cooling
eye gel and it's great for me when I
wake up in the morning and I kind of
have more puffy eyes and I need just
like some some help under the eye area I
really like using this one I was like
scraping my nail all the way through it
like come on any last job but what I
mean I have another one all right I
think actually I have two because I
think I bought one and then I think Oh
lice at me another one in a PR back and
I was like not mad because I'm going to
go through these but I was still like
trying to get every last bit out because
these are more pricey let me tell you
these are more pricey buy them when
they're like buy one get one free or buy
one you don't get something with Olay
freed that's what I did the last time
and I got the eye gels and more of the
cleansing cloths I'm pretty sure it was
that I bought so I really like this I do
though and use it almost daily okay so
like I said I did do a little bit of
decluttering and I got rid of actually a
bunch of lashes here so I reuse my
lashes as often as I can because I wear
lashes almost every single day I love
them but they also can get pricey you
know some of my favorite lashes can be
pricier and things like that so I'm
trying to use my lashes up as much as I
can sometimes you just have to say
goodbye and I have a couple ones here
from Pierre that I'm saying goodbye to
these are the trends that our lashes
also the jetsetter lashes and then also
the flirt lashes so these are all lashes
that they weren't necessarily my
favorite when Pierre came out with their
collection I preferred diva or bombshell
but they were pretty good but I also
used them up enough and I've also gotten
some new lashes recently that I was like
I can go through and get rid of get rid
of a few styles so have the eye lure and
Nicole Guerrero the one for three lashes
these were tough I was really excited
about these most because I love lashes
and I do like Nicole Guerrero so I got
him and I bought them and I was really
looking for Nicole's of their style but
they did not have them so I bought the
one for threes and they're kind of like
a little bit spiky and just a little bit
more like they're almost like rakesh
like I felt more like rock vibes when I
put those on which is cool but not what
I kind of like go for everyday and they
were also the lashes that I felt I had
troubles lining them up correctly on my
eyes because my eyes are
front size and they're also a different
shape so sometimes with certain lashes I
can't pull off the style because of the
differences in my eyes I was gonna say
my two eyes but like how many eyes do
eyes okay so yeah so I didn't get a ton
of use out of these because I kind of
felt more self-conscious when I was
wearing them so I wouldn't repurchase
these just because of my particular
problems but I still like I like them
but I just can't pull them off the best
you know and then another pair of lashes
that I decided to collect to declutter
these are from blinking beauty and these
are the bomb best lashes I also realized
in my intro that I didn't say about my
makeup I usually like to start with like
a disclaimer like guys it's been a crazy
day and that's why I look crazy it's
been a crazy day and that's why I look
crazy if you saw yesterday's video I did
a full video on the morphe and Jaclyn
hill the vault collection and I did a
different look with each of the four
pallets I mean like I look lashes
lipstick and then I was just taking it
off and putting a new luke bag on and
taking it off and putting a new one back
on so my face is like what's going on
and my eyes are kind of like are we open
I don't know and my lips are kind of
burning from taking off so many
different colors of lipstick so if
you're noticing looking crazy
that's why but yesterday's video should
be a fun one so make sure you go check
it out excited a lot of fun filming that
it also took me five hours to film so
I'm now filming past five o'clock what
you don't normally do either so well
can't believe I almost forgot my
disclaimer hello girlfriend how did you
start your videos okay but anyways so
I'm dick cluttering these as well from a
blinking a beauty these are in bomb
masks these just kind of got to the
point where I couldn't clean them
anymore they were just they were done I
wore them a ton but these were like $25
lashes okay
I was gonna wear as many times as I
could to get my money's worth out of
these $25 lashes or this 30 I think
there were 25 on the sephora website I
liked them but there's so many other
lashes that aren't pressing the more
lately I don't know if I would pay 25
dollars again for them I only would if
like during a vib sale or I had some
sort
discount I would not full price I would
not pay full price for these lashes and
I don't think I think I purchased them
in the VIP sale as well but you know
there's just so many other good lashes
out there that are more affordable so I
also used up this guy is like really
gross and disgusting my apologies I'm a
normal human being but this is from
Dermalogica it's the special cleansing
gel I wouldn't through the whole guy of
this which is 8.4 fluid ounces it took
me forever but I got through it and it's
one of my favorite cleansers and I
already do have another one it's really
nice and jumped all especially for
sensitive skin but I love using it in
the morning I just feel like it gets my
face super clean so I love that one
I also did declutter a few of my
eyeliners like I said I decluttered some
from colour-pop here this one in
cry-baby which was a really beautiful
like light lavender it's pretty much
gone and it was almost gone and then the
remaining bit of the eyeliner flew out
one day when I opened it and I like took
the cap off and I went sure it's never
to be found I love this color do you
guys know did they do they not have this
anymore or are they discontinuing them I
always feel like I hear people say that
they're not gonna come back or they're
not around anymore and I never quite
know for sure but they aren't really
good eyeliners their long wearing and I
think they're nice and creamy in the
waterline as well I had the shade besto
also which was kind of like a deep
burgundy that was really pretty and then
the shade maybe which was a cool green
so I did like those and then nice to
have my bigoted tricks here okay so this
one here is from I know ts I think it is
noble through skin care it is the 28th
remedy acne pore deep cleanser I have
maybe one or two more uses out of this
it came in I think it was my FC bag one
month but I it's it's good but I do have
sensitive skin and this was a very like
powerful exfoliator and I would notice
myself getting pretty red after I use
this so I kind of stopped for a while
and then I just have a few uses left so
I was like I'm just gonna go ahead and
declutter that because kind of scares me
a little bit when I use something that
like a brace up on my skin out of some
more skincare this is from Lula
Hendrickson
it's the truth serums this is a little
mini guy that I used up I already have
another mini of it that I got is like a
point perk or something but also it will
Hendrickson sent me a PR package with
the full size of this which is huge and
I'm like oh my gosh but I love this guy
I love the truth serum I try to
incorporate it daily into my skincare
routine routine because I think it's
awesome so yeah I really like this guy
but I like the minis and I like when you
can get them it's like a point burger or
something lol pretty cool okay moving on
I have some oh I have some facial wipes
here oh these are from leaders okay the
front is all peeled off cells like wood
this is from leaders it's the green tea
lip and eye point remover cleanser
tissue so these guys were like super
small rounds like I'm gonna say like
that big and they were I thought it was
just for your lips
I thought the front said like a lip
remover but this is I an --let um but I
actually really like these to remove my
liquid lipstick because they were very
like watery like you could tell that
they were soaked in product for a long
time so they really were able to remove
my liquid lipstick and especially what I
was doing something like when I film
multiple videos in the day and I changed
my lip color or like today where I film
for looks for one video it was nice to
be able to use a really small instead of
like a big facial wipe nice to use
something a little bit smaller and
really remove my lip product so I liked
it for that I don't know if I repurchase
it cuz I don't know no like how often I
need something like that but it was nice
to have them okay and then I have the
milk peeled this is the five minute
flash mask from patch ology this and the
mud mask from pathology are my two
favorites like most recommended sheet
masks I can give you a from at the brand
this one has lactic acid in it plus
fruit enzymes and coconut and soy milk
but it's super cool because it's like a
peel but in a sheet mask and then it's
also really good for sensitive skin I've
never had like peel issues with this or
redness sensitivity anything like that
irritation with my skin but you really
feel like it's working and after I take
it off and I sit there for a while like
you can feel like something's happening
I love these again I incorporate these
either once a week or every other week
right now in my
she'd mask a routine but I think it's
great and then the last item here I
decided to declutter this one this was
from woosh Beauty which you can find at
Ulta and it's kind of like one of those
all-in-one palettes and I don't know who
I'm gonna send this to yet because I
only used it a handful of times and it's
an interesting concept but it's such a
bulky packaging and I'm that person that
I'm like I love when palettes have like
eyeshadows and highlighters and bronzers
and I love face palettes but this one I
was like no this is too big though so
this is what it looks like
and then like you even have this here
too and it's just really big but you're
supposed to have eyes shadows and then
these are cream products and then you
have powder products and you have more
powder products that we're here and
blush and highlight like there's just a
lot going on in this guy and I tried it
and I thought it was fine like this is
what it looks like when you you know put
it all together I thought it was fine
but it's just something that I don't
reach for a ton and it was just it was
just sitting there and it's cluttering
things up and I didn't know how to store
it or where to put it and I don't know
it was just a little bit too much for me
and not all the shades worked out for me
either and then there's cream products
in here I don't know it just wasn't my
favorite so but it's like gently used so
I don't probably gonna give it to some
friend I just don't know who yet but and
then you can also find woosh Beauty at
Ulta beauty unfortunately this wasn't my
favorite so I must have been on the
declarer and hip that day and decided to
get it on with my collection but after
that we have an empty garbage can and we
did it I guess so that's going to be
everything for this month's empties
video we again have an empty trash can
ready to fill up and see what I use up
throughout this month so that you guys
enjoyed it seeing my empties video and
hear my little thoughts and all the
products that I used up are I decided to
kick out of my collection but as always
guys if you did enjoy this one or you
found it helpful I hope that you'll give
this video a thumbs up I hope that
you'll also consider subscribing before
you go and I'll catch you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
