video is going to be my empties video I
have a pretty full little trash can here
I try to do my empties about every
single month going through some of the
products that I've used up and I
typically have a couple of like
declutter items in here as well just
kind of like random declutter so if you
are ready to see a new empties and what
I think about the products that I've
used up when I go ahead and get started
baby so this makeup look will be
tomorrow's video testing out some new
makeup so I'm pretty excited for that as
always everything will be linked it down
below but also if you're curious how it
got this face
that'll be tomorrow's video but jumping
into it okay so first up this is kind of
more of a decluttered item this is from
Oprah it is their body derma Coffee body
scrub I'm not gonna open it because it's
an extremely messy product it's not
completely gone it's I've used it a fair
amount but I kind of been noticing
lately that it's just kind of sitting
there and I decided I kind of like
looked at my bathroom the other day got
a little bit frustrated so I have a
couple of declutter items like skincare
and body care and such like I said I
mean I use this a fair amount of times
but I it makes my shower so messy cuz
it's a coffee scrub and it is very dark
and it just gets everywhere and every
single time that I use this in the
shower I have to go in and fully clean
my shower that's one of my least
favorite things to do so I just wasn't
using this on a very consistent basis
it's really nice to exfoliate I was kind
of using it more when I was like going
to be taking myself tan off I was
finding myself reaching for it but it
just it's just too messy it's just not
my favorite so even though I have a bit
left I'm just gonna go ahead and say
goodbye to it also in here I have a
couple products from Nia skincare or not
into aging skincare
I got a PR package from them awhile ago
and I've just kind of noticed that I'm
not using these products a ton so I'm
just gonna go ahead and get them out of
my collection have them stop cluttering
up my bathroom so this one is the Sunday
detox whipped clay peel-off mask I
actually really didn't enjoy this one
again it was very messy
so when you pop the cap off it has this
little interesting spray oh geez and has
this I'm kind of like a moose spray type
thing
then when you put it in a dust it kind
of does look like mousse and we put it
on it too very like dark kind of like
charcoal mask or whatnot and you're
supposed to be able to peel it off at
the end and it just doesn't really it
just didn't really work that way from me
and each time I tried it it just seemed
to be more messy and more work than I
thought it was like doing for like
benefits for my skin
the peel off didn't really work either
and I ended up kind of having to scrub
up my face which irritated it a lot so I
just didn't really love that product
also another product from them this is
their wash and Glo hydrating cleansing
foam ah this one it just has a very
small bit left I use it on a fairly
consistent basis when I was reviewing it
a while ago but again I've had it in my
bathroom for a long time and I've just
been finding other cleansers and just
saw their skincare brands that I feel
like I'm a lot more loyal to so I
noticed that this one hasn't been
touched in a while and I also that I've
got a pretty good use out of it it's
probably not worth it to even pass on to
someone else on my favorite products I
think you can find them at Ulta but I
just have other skincare brands that I
prefer this one here is from Neutrogena
this is the ultra lite at cleansing oil
I actually do like this guy I went
through several of these I use neutral
Neutrogena a ton in college and like
like the years post college I used
Neutrogena skin care like crazy I feel
like as I've gotten older and on
thirty-one now I feel like I pay more
attention to my skincare I pay more
attention to the ingredients in my
skincare and I don't mind paying a
little bit more for my skincare I always
did care about skincare especially in
college and post college it was steps
that I never skipped out on but I wasn't
necessarily looking at the ingredients
and I didn't have a lot of money of
course just by when you're a college
student I don't have a lot of money to
spend on my skincare so I went through
Neutrogena a lot I have found other
cleansing oils that I prefer now and
that I do repurchase but I've gone
through several of these bottles
throughout the years this will probably
be my last one but you know maybe if you
have a little bit of like a younger skin
maybe check out this product I still
feel like it does a really good job
yourself a lot of your makeup even like
waterproof makeup and stuff and I feel
like it really gets a lot off and it
doesn't like
my skin like it doesn't feel like it's
like stripping my skin or leaving it
really dry or anything like that so it's
a good product I just have other brands
that I prefer now if that makes sense
a product that just didn't really work
out from either side just get it out of
my collection this is from Pixie Beauty
this is their 24k eye elixir it's
supposed to be an energizing peptide
serum so it's a little like it kind of
reminds me of like a perfume rollerball
so it's a little roller like this and it
sorry my hands are shaking this I this
filming I get ready with me takes three
hours I'm filming again afterwards and
I'm just really hungry
it's 3:20 I didn't realize that was 32
oh my gosh it's 3:30 okay so I'm really
hungry
hmm this guy I realized I didn't really
like it I feel like you can't get a lot
of product out of it because it's not
like a squeeze tube i serum or anything
like that you kind of just have to roll
it on your eyes and sometimes like I'd
find myself like shake shake shake cuz
when you do this like I can hear that
there's liquid in there but I could not
get it to translate onto my skin so I
felt like I wasn't getting a lot of
product and then the times that I felt
like I was actually getting product out
when I would wake up my eyes were almost
always completely crusted over a lot of
times when I used this at night I would
also wake up in the middle of the night
with irritated eyes I do a very
sensitive eyes but not a lot of eye
creams do that to me or I sermon or
anything like that so this guy was an L
go I found it kind of like shoved down
in one of my like my cabinet upstairs
and I was like yeah it's because
whenever I wear it it hurts my eyes so
this next one here is from BRE OG oh
this is the risk RL milk reparative
leave-in conditioning spray this is a
little mini guy here I don't remember if
this was a point perk or if it came in
like a little set but it says it's an
ultra lightweight leave-in conditioning
spray like I like to this guy I would
put it I would spray it in my hair after
I got out of the shower and then I just
always just let my hair air dry I feel
like I did like it
I felt like out of everything I just
finished this guy up not too long ago I
felt like it made my hair look a little
bit smoother I do deal with frizzy hair
kind of
try to curl it today to do something
different I do deal with a lot of frizz
and I felt like that's kind of like
helped just make it a little bit
smoother I didn't get a ton of uses out
of it though which surprised me because
it's not like the smell this little
bottle in the world but I don't know I
kind of want to try another sample of it
and then maybe purchase the full size
I'm trying to get trying to do more
things with my hair in 2018 some of my
resolutions sample my hair care game and
all of that but I'm not completely sold
on it yet but like I'm almost sold on it
you know you know what I'm saying has
anyone tried this let me know what you
think too if you think it'd be worth
getting the full size I have a bunch of
sheet masks on here this is - nobody is
surprised so these are from pathology
these are the illuminate sheet massacre
my head I'm so hungry
these are the illuminate sheet masks so
honestly for the longest time I didn't
really love the pathology illuminate
sheet mask and I would reach for the
hydrate one more so I took this I took
like a little pathology set with me on
my Oklahoma City trip I used the
illuminate sheet mask the first night I
was there so I flown in all morning
before I went to sleep I did this mask
the next day I could not stop staring at
my face like I thought my makeup looked
so good and I was using the I'm Stasi a
stick foundation which isn't one of my
favorites I took it with me because it's
good to travel with and I wasn't
checking a bag but I remember I kept
staring at my face and I'm like what is
happening here and I used this again
when I was home it was just a couple
days ago I used this one again before my
makeup in the morning and again I feel
like my skin looks really nice when I
use these so I'm pretty I'm pretty
curious about that I do I felt like it
really was illuminating and giving me a
glow and just making me more hydrated
and I was very excited about that
because these have not been my favorite
in the past but now I'm actually really
quite liking them
so those are two from pathology I have
another one from pathology this is the
hydrate sheet mask again I also use this
one in Oklahoma City I brought that
along with me as well that's one of my
favorite sheet masks if you are dry I
would suggest that one I have one here
from bio Bell
this was the unicorn shake it's to
clarify and brighten with dark red
cherries and yoghurt it looks like this
this I like bio bell sheet mask I've
purchased a lot of them myself and there
they
always been right up there with
pathology for me this would not say on
my skin it was the weirdest thing it
wasn't that long ago that I went to try
it and I pulled it out and it was really
cool because it's kind of like this
unicorn line that they came out with
their the sheet mats are a little bit
different from their regular sheet masks
and I've tried other ones in the line
and I've never had a problem with it
this one completely slid off my face and
I tried again to like get it back on and
make it stick and it just slid right off
my face so I couldn't I mean I can't
even already view it because I couldn't
get it to stay on my face I thought that
was really weird
I've never experienced that with any
sheet masks I'm a sheet mask a lover I
mean obviously you always see she masks
in my empties videos I'm a big fan but
that was so weird though so weird I also
have in here at the milk peel 5 minute
flash mask a from patch ology this is
one of my absolute favorites this is in
my weekly skincare routine hands down no
matter what
it has lactic acid fruit enzymes coconut
and soy milk it's like a peel but in a
sheet mask and it's really good if you
have sensitive skin because it doesn't
feel like a peel like you're not you're
not all sensitive and red when you get
done taking it off but you like you can
tell that something just happened to
your skin it's just it'll dissolve
that's it'll dissolve dead cells give me
some food
smooth and brighten without any
irritation I totally agree with that I
go through these like crazy I really
enjoy them sometimes I don't even put
all the sheet masks in this bin because
it's just like so repetitive but you
know sometimes I try throw em in there
to remind people what's my favorite this
next product here is from a fresh this
is the rose a face mask so this was like
a birthday gift from Sephora like
several years ago right like I mean not
even it's not this past year I didn't
even get the birthday gift wasn't last
year I don't think it was the year
before that it might even a year before
that I have had this in my collection
for the longest time and again it's one
of those things were like I get new
products and things piled on top of each
other and I was kind of cleaning out my
skincare drawer the other night like I
was saying and I found this and I was
like oh this will be really nice to take
all my Oklahoma trip with me I was
trying to pack all minis I wasn't
checking a bag and I opened it and was
like no that's expired that has to be
expired I still put it in here because I
want to talk about it
but I was like there's no way and it
only looked like I had like one use left
and if you guys have followed me for a
while I talked about when when things
get really down there to like one or two
uses left I like stopped using it cuz
I'm like oh no I don't want to run out
totally did that with this because you
can tell it was almost empty anyways but
this was a really nice mask
so it's infused with real rose petals to
hydrate and tone I mean it reminds me of
that fresh the rose toner that they have
except this one is a face mask and you
just leave it on for a little bit and it
I don't it smells really nice from what
I remember using it and I use this a lot
when I first got it it's very hydrating
it leaves your skin very soft I think
did it say that well it does it'll give
your skin very soft I really did like
this little guy so this was a good
birthday gift for me if you're
interested in a new face mask it's
something that's just not it's not too
much on the skin this one was really
nice it was just kind of horrifying to
open it like no you can't use that you
cannot use that okay one more sheet mask
in here from pachala jeans and I think
we're done with sheet masks this is the
smart mud no mess mud mask detox to
eliminate impurities again you see this
in pretty much every single empties
video that I do one of my hands-down
favorite sheet masks this and the milk
peel from pathology I recommend over and
over and over again this is always in my
skincare routine every single week it's
a mud mask put a sheet mask it's super
easy there's no fuss there's no dirty
sink or anything like that and your skin
feels like tightened when you're done
with say I just mmm this was one of my
favorite sheet masks I highly recommend
it it's ten minutes it doesn't take long
to do it all I'm always recommending
that one so I have some makeup remover
wipes these are from Garnier skin active
the clean refreshing movie refreshing
remover cleansing towelettes okay then
these I don't really buy makeup wipes to
remove my makeup I use them to take off
swatches but I thought these were very
nice to take off swatches I actually
have another one in my drawer I can see
it right here so I like these for makeup
swatches I don't really like remover
wipes on my face anymore this one here
is an item that I'm just getting rid of
as well this is from way haircare it's
the dry shampoo foam this was
terrible I'm so disappointed myself I
think I put this in a make up I regret
buying video recently and then I think
right after I film that I like threw it
in my empty spinning so I was like no
this was awful it did nothing I mean it
did nothing it's an interesting concept
it's a dry shampoo foam so it's like a
mousse but it's supposed to like
obviously like suck up the oils and make
your hair look not so dirty no I did do
that so that was a bummer I do have a
dry shampoo that I do like this is from
the dry bar it's the detox at dry
shampoo yeah I have another one this is
a mini have a full-size this one is
really good if you're looking for a good
dry shampoo that's actually going to
like work on your hair it doesn't leave
anything you know doesn't leave any
white casts or anything like that in my
hair this is really nice I also like the
way that it smells so I've already
repurchased that one so that's a good
one okay so some more like kind of
decluttered items this is kind of random
but I put in here some uh perfumes that
I have so I have two different perfumes
in here that I just do not I do not use
anymore and I got these gifted to me
I mean I'm gonna say six years ago I
took these with me when we moved into
our house and we just celebrated five
years in our house so I've had these
were longer than five years but I never
reach for these scents because they just
they were never quite me
I'm not a big perfume warrior anyways
but now that I feel like I finally
figured out the sense I like in my
perfume these are definitely not it the
bottles are in kind of rough shape so
like I'd probably see if like my friends
want them or something but I mean
there's still product left in them I
don't know what perfume like goes back
or how bad like how quickly just perfect
them go bad can anybody know cause like
if they're just not gonna be good I mean
I don't know I don't really want to pass
them on but this is Gucci Guilty intense
and it's intense it's a it's a - too
overwhelming the packaging is like super
beautiful and I know perfumes are very
expensive but I just was not wearing
them this one is from Chloe and I have
another Chloe perfume there it is yeah I
have another Chloe perfume and I like it
I like the packaging on these and
they're super pretty but again like you
can see I just wasn't you
that's because this is but that one has
to have gone bad the one has to have
gone bad there's no way that's a scent
of a perfume one's just gone bad we're
just gonna I don't want to smell that
again I remember not liking it and again
it being too fragrant and too intense
but there's no way that that's whoa okay
moving on I'm awake I'm awake now okay
so I have some lashes in here and
honestly um these are two pairs of
lashes for lashes in here two pairs of
lashes in this little set these both
appear to be ardell lashes and I can
tell the scarier case is Ardell I just
don't really want our doll lashes
anymore I feel like I can't pull them
off like something about them they just
don't look good on me anymore and I
always struggle with them but I've kept
them in my eyelash drawer for the
longest time and I'm like just get rid
of them you don't wear them they just
they just don't look good on you anymore
man I also kind of went through my nail
polishes because my nail polish
collection was a bit out of control and
now I've been doing the dip nails at the
salon it's just like so fast and easy
and I feel like it's working out really
well and they seem to last longer which
is great my nails are not breaking but
it's not like I'm not sitting there
watching someone paint my nails because
the whole time someone paints my nails
I'm just like I could be doing this at
home like I'm just sitting here paying
for someone to paint my nails it just
seems so ridiculous so I have quite a
large nail polish collection and since I
started doing the dips I was like let's
let's just go through this and see what
we can get rid of this is from Sally
Hansen it is one of their hardest nails
extreme we're in violet voltage it's all
like separated and gross and I've had
that one forever in a day so it doesn't
even look like there's a lot left this
one is from OPI this is their what is
this not about you again I've had this I
have this I think before I even start at
YouTube it's all separated and it's it's
looking worse for wear and then this one
here is from sin sinful shine with gel
tech and this is in a VIP it's just a
bright pink this one actually doesn't
look bad at the moment I don't know why
I got rid of this one cuz I actually
like this color so I'm assuming maybe it
did look really separate it just kind of
got jumbled up here huh my guess is that
it's probably almost gone because that's
what I was looking for renounce
declutter
my nail polishes just trying to kick out
the ones that are bow gone and I don't
really reach for a lot
I haven't hear a baby lips from
Maybelline I used to wear these all the
time like these were like my go-to and I
feel like I still have like a little
little bit of this one left but yeah
these used to be like my go-to that I
used to buy my own baby lips like crazy
but not so much anymore uh I also
haven't hear from benefit this is the
goof proof a brow pencil one of my
favorite brow pencils and I feel like
I've been reaching for it more and more
lately which is interesting this one is
in the shade - I either get a shade - or
shade 3 I would repurchase this but but
if it actually just sent me another box
I don't even know I was like thank you
about a fit and actually have the goof
proof in it so that was really exciting
because otherwise I would repurchase it
the benefit goof proof and precisely my
brow I feel like I just always wanted my
collection they're just kind of like the
staples for me and I think I know
they're not gonna let me down kind of
thing and so I really do like that one
I haven't here the YSL the shock mascara
this was a little mini that I got as
like a point perk I think it was this
look great mascara like this is a great
mascara I'm sure it's very expensive for
the full size for a YSL but if there was
like another point perk or something for
this I would totally get it again I
don't like spending a ton of money on
mascaras because I wear false lashes a
lot this is a nice mascara it's a very
wet formula I do remember that but yeah
that's a good one I also have in here
from Tarte so this is their TARDIS Pro
like lash adhesive yeah the lash
adhesive I do not like this at all I
pretty much got it like mostly used up
just because I wanted to use it up but I
did not like it it just was it's nice
and black which is good and I feel like
it blunts and easier with your lashes
and such but it's one of those like it
reminds me of the House of lashes
eyelash adhesive where it's too sticky I
feel like my lashes are just like kind
of destroyed after I use this because
the band is so sticky and it's just not
cute it does make your lashes stay on
for a long time but I don't like what it
does to my actual lashes because I reuse
my lashes like a fiend because I wear
lashes a lot and they can get expensive
one of my favorite lash adhesives
this is from duo it's the clear white
eyelash adhesive you can find this at
Sephora you can find it out alton you
can find it at drugstores this is just a
little mini guy i've already repurchased
it i got the big guy the next time I'm
not really sure why I got many of it I
love this I will always have this in my
collection it's one of my favorite
eyelash iq stoves it works so well
it comes out white but it will dry
completely clear well vit always will
have it and then the last item I have in
here is one of those like silly sponges
or what are these called silly fun
silicone sponge I don't know whatever
this is I believe this one was from ELF
I want to say yeah I'm pretty sure this
one was from ELF they sent me like two
sponges this one and like a glitter
sponge as well but I'm pretty sure I've
decluttered too I just don't really like
these I like tonight like I liked him at
first when I first tried it I was like
oh this is cool I get the concept of it
and then I was like now I know I prefer
a beauty blender or a brush so I'm just
gonna go ahead and keep this out of my
collection cuz it's not needed anymore
so I ready laughs trash bin is empty and
this video is complete so magaz
everything up on my latest empties video
I hope you enjoyed going through my
trash with me like I said I try to do
these about every single month so I
should be back next month with a new
