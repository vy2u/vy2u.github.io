today's video is going to be a new
empties video so I have some items here
in my Beauty empties Trash Can that I'm
over with you I said in my last empties
video that I really wanted to do this on
a more consistent basis so that is what
I am attempting to do so if you'd like
to see if some of the products that I
have it used up recently why don't I go
ahead and get started
alrighty so I actually just put this in
my trash can last night this is from
number 7 it's the youthful vitamin C of
fresh radiance essence so I really enjoy
number seven as a brand I really really
like their skincare I have a lot of
their products I stand by a lot of their
products so I was really excited I did
get this one sent to me in a little
package from number 7 and I also love
vitamin C in my skincare it's really
good for anti-aging you girls turn 31 so
anti-aging please so I was really
excited to get this I know a lot of
people talk a lot about vitamin C and so
when I saw this in the dropper form I
thought that that was really good cuz a
lot of people say like that's kind of
one of the best ways for vitamin C or
basically just not to have an achar it's
what people tell me whenever I talk
about vitamin C that's like in a jar
that you open so when I saw this little
dropper form I was like surely that's
got to please the people that know more
about skincare than me
I don't claim to like know a ton of of
skincare I just enjoy skincare so I was
like surely that's gonna make some
people happy it is a pretty small little
bottle here and you can see I used it
all up in last thing I was like trying
to squeeze out any last product that I
could I was like oh you gotta admit it
it's gone so you get point three three
ounces and it's about 225 dollars so it
is pretty pricey but it lasted me a
pretty long time and I would use this in
my skincare routine probably about three
times a week I would say and I really
did like it I'm kind of bummed that it's
gone I thought the dropper form was
really easy to use and even though it's
a little bit pricier I would repurchase
this again at number 7 is one of those
brands that I've continually repurchased
their skincare products I seem to always
have at least one of their skincare
products in my regular routine right now
it's one of their glow surrounds I use
it every single morning so I would
repurchase this guy
I think it's expensive but I think it's
pretty good so I would repurchase that
one I also have a brow pencil in here
this one was in my eighteen and twenty
eighteen project pan and it is my first
project in my project pan that I used up
it is from a thrive cosmetics it's the
Audrey infinity waterproof eyebrow liner
my shade is an Audrey this was a really
nice brow pencil I definitely would
repurchase this one again as well I just
got a bunch of new brow products to try
out but if I was in the market for a new
one I would repurchase this one I think
these are a little bit pricier as well
in the twenty dollar range from thrive
cosmetics but the knife cosmetics is a
really cool brand if you haven't heard
of them I would check them out they do a
lot of really cool things and they have
like a good mission farther brand so I
really did like this brow pencil I took
a traveling with me quite a bit and once
I put it in my project pan I was pretty
good at using it all the way up so I
could at least get something finished by
my first check-in and so I do like that
one I would recommend another brow
product I have in here is from a benefit
this is the precisely my brow pencil
this is like one of my Holy Grail brow
pencils I always have this one on hand I
already have another one I mean it's
just it's something that I continually
go back to I feel like I could never
really mess up my brows when I use the
precisely my brow and I can't say that
was a whole lot of other provinces so I
really like this one
definitely would recommend let's see I
have a mascara in here this is from
L'Oreal this is the UH voluminous
eyelash at paradise a lot of people went
crazy when this mascara released a lot
of people compared it to the Too Faced
better than sex mascara I actually agree
I think it is similar to the Too Faced
better than sex mascara but also in a
bad way because the better than sex
mascara flakes on me really bad and this
one does the exact same thing I would
not repurchase this one at myself it was
fine you know to like use up and I used
it I used it up there's there's really
not much left of it it was fine but like
especially for days if I was you know
going to be like going out for a while I
would not want to wear it because I knew
that I would get mascara flakes all over
my cheeks so it's a drugstore mascara
but not really one that I would be able
to recommend because I didn't like the
messy look on my face I did a little bit
of decluttering if you guys watched I
recently posted a what's in my makeup
drawer of shame
video and I've been really trying to get
better at getting rid of products that I
don't use a lot like I just I'm such a
clutter II person I'm such a hoarder and
it's really not cool and I'm trying
really hard to work on it when I was
reorganizing my office the other weekend
I was kind of going through some of the
acrylics I moved my desk looks a lot
nicer than it has in the past
I actually got another table for my
office and I moved a bunch of my
acrylics to that table that have some of
my makeup items in there and so I was
going through them and I found this
little drawer with these two products in
here and I was like girlfriend why have
you been hanging onto these you can get
rid of them so this one here is from a
Paula Dorf it's the universal brow
pencil in taupe and then I also have
from Winky Lux this is the peeper
perfect and now I can't remember if this
was a concealer or an eye primer I want
to say it was an eye primer if it was
called peeper perfect but I remember
being confused when I saw it and being
like because I want to say it was a
concealer and I was like it sounds like
an eye primer I really don't remember
these both came in like an Ipsy bag for
me and this one I just never really
loved or even really understood it and
then this one was just a little bit too
dark for me I know it's supposed to be a
universal brow pencil but I really don't
like when my brows are too too dark and
I felt like no matter how light I was
pressing I wasn't able like I'm just you
know I'm not the best with brows anyways
and I have my my comfort zone when it
comes to my brow pencils and a universal
brow pencil like this one just didn't
really work out for me so these are two
you know really mini products from my
Ipsy bag that I very rarely reach for
and I found him in that little drawer
and I was like no you're gonna say
goodbye it's embarrassing I have another
brow pencil in here this is from Anasazi
Beverly Hills this is the brow Wiz in
taupe so I finished this one up this one
is just OK for me I know a lot of people
use it and a lot of people swear by it
it's it's just okay I feel like it
really takes a lot of my brows out when
I do them I feel like when I get done
doing my brows I have like brows on my
face I have like brows and stuck in the
pencil so it's okay I can use it pretty
well you know it's similar to the
precisely my brow with just a small tip
on the end and those are like my comfort
zone when it comes to brow products so I
think it's okay I just wish it wouldn't
pull my brows as much as it did it was
recently on sale on the off to 21 days
of beauty and I truly thought
driving another one because it was gonna
be like $10 and I'd rather pay $10
versus the 21 for something that I think
is just okay but then like I said I got
a couple of the bomb brow products to
try out and then I also got the new
benefit on a new benefit precisely my
brow and so I was like you know what I
think I think I'm pretty good I think I
have a Revlon too that I got to try out
so I was like ah since it's not your
absolute favorite I've I've not really
been on a no buy or a low buy but like I
have but like I haven't said it I
haven't come out and been like I'm you
know not buying anything right now or
I'm not buying a lot right now but I
definitely have been so each time with
the Ulta 21 days of beauty when there's
been something that I've been thinking
about buying I pull it up and I put it
in my cart and I just stare at it for a
really long time I walk away I come back
and usually every single time like I
haven't bought anything with the 21 days
of beauty sale yet I've been able to
talk myself out of everything so we've
been going through some life changes
recently and now that we have a few big
ones coming up too so it's kind of
played into it but I didn't ever really
want to be like I'm gonna know by arlo
by because you know sometimes that's
hard especially when you're a youtuber
but that's why I didn't buy a new one of
Amistad day I was like do you really
need it
you have other brow products you're
trying ones out you have your favorites
in there like take a step back take a
step back Samantha I have quite a few
sheet masks in here I love sheet masks I
have a - from a pathology these are the
smart mud no mess mud masks these are
some of my favorite maps I use them at
least weekly at least once a week I use
some of these I don't always put all my
sheet masks in here just because
sometimes it gets to be a lot but I I
can even see more that's in there but
this is one of my like hands down a
favorite a sheet mask I love mud masks
but they're so messy that I love this in
a sheet mask because it's so much
cleaner my stink isn't a disaster my
hands aren't a disaster it's just one of
my favorite spa geology has some of my
favorite sheet masks I like that a lot
of them are very like time friendly for
people like me who's always like
constantly doing something like I don't
have a lot of downtime for my sheet mask
the mud masks I believe are ten minutes
I think it is and I just I can feel it
pulling everything out when I'm going
through like a bad skin time I'm
typically always reaching for the mud
mask from Kajal
I also tried out there stood five minute
flash mask this month this is a newer
mask to them this one I didn't really
love it's supposed to like take away
redness but I honestly thought it made
me redder than it was it says it has
aloe vera and cottonseed extract for
natural anti-inflammatories that helps
soothe and calm redness it's also
supposed to de-stress the skin and
improve moisture for a plump youthful
glow again just not my favorite there's
other petrology masks like the smart
masks like the hydrate masks that I just
really enjoy a lot more than milk peels
really good so this one wasn't my
favorite I felt like my skin just don't
really get along with that one but those
are some sheet masks I do have a
discount code from the petrology website
if anyone's ever interested in trying it
out not a discount code not an affiliate
code for me just a discount code for you
or you can also find it pathology at the
OTO website I have another brow pencil
in here this one is from Maybelline this
is the total temptation a brow definer
I've already went on and to repurchase
this this is one of my favorite brow
products and it's really nice and
affordable from the drugstore Maybelline
was having a buy two get one free sale
the other day so I actually bought two
more of these and then I bought the
Maybelline fit me concealer as well so
I've got the concealer feel free and got
two new brow products so one of my
favorite brow products it reminds me of
the oh I actually have it in my brows
today but it reminds me of the Benefit
goof-proof was kind of that teardrop
shape except it's smaller and thinner
and I just feel like I get more control
with it so I really like that one I have
my shade in blonde in the Maybelline
let's see I also haven't here from NYX
this is a soft matte lip cream and this
is in abu-dhabi this is one of my
favorite soft matte lip creams one of my
favorite shades from NYX in this line I
already do have a backup of this one
because it's one of my favorite news
it's really beautiful definitely
recommend the NYX soft matte lip cream
so they're nice and affordable they have
a huge shade ring and abu-dhabi is one
of my favorites I have some makeup wipes
here this is from number 7 it's the
beautiful skin quick thinking up wipes
so that's quick thinking wipes I don't
know if I really understand that name
this has 30 wipes in here I don't
necessarily use makeup wipes to remove
my makeup I prefer a cleansing oil or
cleansing balm or something like that
but I do use makeup wipes for like
swatches and things
so I can't really tell you how it works
well on my face but it works well for
removing splotches which is great so
those are from number seven I also have
a pair of lashes in here that I'm saying
goodbye to these are from huda beauty
these are these Samantha lashes I again
already have a backup of this pair as
well these are like my OG lashes when I
started purchasing like high-end lashes
the who dismantle were some of the first
ones that I did because everybody on
YouTube would rave about Buddha lashes
and I had especially hear a lot about
the Samantha lashes so these are really
good lashes I do enjoy them I have
others that I would consider to be more
of a favorite now and these are
expensive I think they're like $20 or
just over $20 so I typically every month
recommend getting them on us you know
some sort of discount let the VIP sale
is coming up or something like that but
I do like these lashes I like to think
that they're named after me yeah maybe
I'm just kidding just kidding
okay so also in here I have this little
guy from Lula Hendrickson this is the
transforming almond facial peel it says
with almond and bamboo extracts oke Oke
kernel flower I got a little trio of
these mini scrubs from Lula Hendrickson
around the holiday time it had three
different scrubs in there I started off
with the poor sauna facial scrub
fell in love with it repurchase the full
size of it for my shower loved it I then
went on and put this one into my shower
and this one I did not love I do have
sensitive skin I've pretty dry skin
right now but it is also sensitive and I
think this one was just too much how it
says it has the oat kernel flour in
there it it has a lot of like
exfoliating you know grittiness to it
and I think it was just too much a for
my skin I was noticing my skin was
really red when I would get out of the
shower because I like to put a little
scrubs in the shower and usually when I
have like conditioner sitting in my hair
I'll go ahead and put a scrub on I just
feel like it helps you know the steam
and everything from the shower and I
love multitasking so like why not do it
in the shower as well but this one was
just a little bit too much for me I
wouldn't repurchase this one if you have
sensitive skin I probably wouldn't mark
them on this one maybe if you have oily
skin it might work pretty well for you
but for me it did not it did not go well
and let's see here also in here I have
some
more sheet masks so we have another one
from pathology another one at the mud
mask I said that's just one of my
favorites I use it so often this is the
milk peel that I was talking about it's
a five-minute flash mask goes on here it
will dissolve dead cells smooth them
brighten without any irritation it's
inspired by a top Korean beauty trend is
gentle enough for even and sensitive
skin and making it the perfect peel for
first-timers
I love facial peels I used to get them
so often like I would have a friend who
was an aesthetician I'd go to her house
and like she would give me peels because
I love them so much and this is a really
good option again it's only a 5-minute
mask so it's really quick and easy to
use but I feel like it's actually doing
something to my skin I feel like I am
getting a pretty gentle peel but at the
same time I like the way that my skin
looks after I use these so I would
recommend the milk peel and then this
one is another five minute max this is
the illuminator to brighten dull skin I
prefer the hydrate over the illuminate
which is in a blue package but I don't
mind the illuminate I just I don't feel
like I don't feel like I'd necessarily
need to brighten a lot I don't use a lot
of products that say you know it'll
brighten skin because it's just
something that I don't feel like I
personally need so that's why I don't
really gravitate towards these but if
this is something that you like for your
skin or you find yourself using a lot of
products you might like this one and
again it's only five minutes so I really
like how quick and easy these are but
just to if my lighting has been crazy it
is pretty dark out and snowing in April
so do have my green light on okay
another product here this is a from a
soap &amp;amp; Glory this is the righteous of
butter creamy a body wash you can see I
used this baby all the way up I really
enjoyed this I put it in a make up
monthly in my favorite section I was
like all about this product it's like a
it's like thick and luxurious and nice
and moisturizing and hydrating for the
body but I went through this so quickly
I don't know what it is about this
product I feel like I have not gone
through a body wash especially a good
sized body wash I feel like I've not
gone through and that quickly in a while
so I think these are issue or fordable
because I remember looking on the awful
website at one point but yeah who else
has tried these from soap &amp;amp; Glory I love
the smell of it I'm just worried about
how fast I went through it which was
kind of wild so also in here I have a
Garnier skin active this is there at
micellar cleansing water so I have like
the big guy here this is one that took
me a while to figure out I don't like I
don't think that it removes makeup good
enough and I think when I started using
it I was like yeah okay it's pretty
decent and then as I was using other
especially like the cleansing oils and
cleansing balm sick I was talking about
I realized that those actually remove
everything and this kind of it's like it
would remove like the top layer but then
there would still be makeup underneath
maybe it wouldn't get all my eyeliner
off you know my lash adhesive things
like that I realized that I was really
having to like saturate whatever it was
I was using to take off my makeup the
cotton round or the Shiseido cotton or
anything like that where I don't have to
use this much product with something
else so these are more affordable but I
don't think I would recommend these
because I think it's just a little bit
too mmm it's just not it's just not good
enough there's better things on the
market I have another item here from
pathology oh these are they're the
five-minute hydrogels the lip remote lip
renewal removal that beer elf these I
love and this reminds me that I need to
pull one out and probably do it tonight
I feel like my lips are like peeling
they're not like peeling stage as of
lately so I really need to do this
pathology has i jealous they have lip
mask I recommend them both I use them
both but I really do like these lip
peels for when my lips need they need a
little bit of help some hydration all
that good stuff
okay I also haven't here oh this is just
like a hand cream this is from a Veda
which I don't know if everybody would
have a Nevada and we have them in our
area in the Midwest here in Iowa and
it's like I think it's a school in a
cosmetology school but you can go and
like you don't get your hair done and
nails done and stuff like that but this
is their hand relief and this is
actually a really good hand lotion I
actually have an extra one I used to
just like get them when I would go and
get my hair done there they would just
like give them to you each appointment
so I actually have more of these but
they're really good but that one's empty
really like that very like thick thick
and good for your hands especially in
the winter time I have this next item
here this is from a first aid beauty
it's the skin rescue deep cleanser with
red clay I broke the cap to it have a
little twisty cap
so that really like
a fire under me to get rid of this
cleanser I was like that can't be good
luckily it happened when I was I think I
was already over halfway done with it so
it didn't take me too much longer to use
up but I really did like it I didn't
want to just toss it when that happened
so I actually really did like this I
like first aid beauty and they are
geared towards people with sensitive
skin so I really have gravitated towards
that brand I've tried a lot from the
brand I really do like a lot from them I
really did like this cleanser I felt
like it was really doing a lot for my
skin but nothing too overpowering it
didn't irritate me at all it says to
remove excess oils on clogged pur unclog
pores and purify and I did like this guy
I got this one in epsy bag as well and I
did like it already and almost done the
last item in here is not your mother's
plump for joy thickening hair lifter I
think I got this one in a beauty compact
and I this okay this was one that I kind
of went back and forth on but finally I
made up my mind I I know what I think
about this and I do really like it it
says it's for fine thin hair I mean
hello
says to volumize strengthen and give you
a luxurious as shine and it matches my
shirt which is fantastic okay so I felt
like I was having a hard time with this
one because when you spray it it's
completely gone now but when you spray
it it comes out in a very intense spray
you know it's not like a fine mist or
anything that you can spray all over
your hair when you spray it it's going
boom right in that one spot that you're
spraying it and I was like ah I don't
know if I like this but what I would do
is I would lift up parts of my hair and
spray it and just take my time and do it
all the way around my hair and do it
like towards you know like my bangs
right here and in the back and then I
would just take my hands and kind of
like Jewish everything together to try
to make sure that I was really getting
in all those spots and then I was like
okay it does it does actually do what it
says that it's going to do and so I use
this on a pretty consistent basis for a
while and I actually would repurchase
this because it does suck having really
thin fine hair I wear hair extensions a
lot a lot of times also get conditioner
and I'll put a lot of mousse in my hair
just it makes my hair curly but also it
just gives me volume because I just feel
like my hair is always just so sad but
you know that's just real life I can
I can't change that but this actually
does help quite a bit so it's not your
mother's I think you can find this at
Target I'm not sure about Ulta but I
always link everything down in the
description box all the products that
I'm talking about as long as I can find
them my makeup everything like that so
it will be down there but yeah the stuff
actually did work if you have hair like
mine and you need to mop it up I would
recommend this one I guess that's going
to be everything before today's Beauty
empties if you've seen the lip gloss on
my teeth down line that I'm trying out a
new lip gloss and I ran my tongue over
my teeth at one point I was like wow my
teeth feel really fuzzy you like did I
brush my teeth today and then I looked
at myself in the mirror you could see
like a really like really thin sheet of
pink on my teeth oh it's like the lip
gloss that's transferring onto my teeth
ooh just want to mention that but that
is it for today's Beauty empties like I
said I want to do these on a more
consistent basis if not every month I'm
gonna try for every other month but I
still feel like I had it quite a few
products to get through today I feel
like I'm doing better at getting through
products project panning is really
helping me out and then also we we might
be moving soon so I'm kind of doing a
better job at like decluttering using up
products you know things like that not
bringing as much into my collection as
well with kind of being on that low buy
also so yeah that was my Beauty empties
for today I hope that you guys enjoyed
it if you did I hope that you'll give
this video a thumbs up I hope that
you'll also consider subscribing before
you go and I'll get you guys in
enterprise video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
