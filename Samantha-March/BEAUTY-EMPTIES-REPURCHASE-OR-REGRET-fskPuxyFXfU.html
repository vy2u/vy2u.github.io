is going to be my empties video my
little pink trashcan is looking kind of
full lately so I've decided to clear it
out show you guys everything that I have
used up and let you know my feedback on
them I usually call my empties videos
like repurchase or regret because I kind
of can give you guys a better idea a
better review on them since I've gone
through the products just let you know
what to think about them let you know if
it didn't work out for me or if I'm
going to go repurchase it because I
ended up loving it so much I love
watching empties videos because I find
the review so helpful and seeing what
people actually go through it you know
can be so hard to go through makeup and
beauty products and skincare so it's
interesting to see what we're actually
using up so I'm just gonna go through my
little trash can here and show you guys
what I've used up let you know my
thoughts on them so if you would like to
see my Beauty empty is my first Beauty
empties Hub 2017 please keep watching
okay so I went through a body wash
finally this was from like um let's uh
store oh Bath &amp;amp; Body Works Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works this is their vanilla bean Noel I
got it because it said sparkling
snowflake scrub and I was like why not I
thought it was fine I guess I don't know
I feel like I only produce from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works when they're having like
really amazing sales and that's when I
picked this one up I thought it was fine
it's not anything I need to like run out
and repurchase but if they're having
another like balm sale I would totally
get one I used up some haircare this is
the L'Oreal triple resist reinforcing
conditioner I've had this like for a
really long time and it took me really
long to go through it it's just so many
conditioners that I feel like weigh down
my hair and I have really thin hair so
when something starts to weigh down my
hair it's just a disaster it's so thin
it won't stay in ponytails like it
doesn't look good so this I used so
sparingly because I just didn't love it
I don't know why I just in throw it away
I should have because why but I just
like feel guilty doing it but I used it
up it took me a while but I went through
it I definitely would not repurchase
this this one was a regret this little
package in here this is from the Tarte
like pack your bag
they're under eye rescue eye masks these
eye masks are amazing and I realized
after I use them the first time a lot of
people say that you can read use them
they just put them back in here and then
reuse them like four times or something
and I'm like I'm totally doing that the
first time I used time I just serve away
and then I saw someone else is filming
the video and they said they're actually
reusable I'm like why did I not know
that the first time these are so good I
love under-eye masks I love under I like
hydration because I can tend to get dry
under eyes the Tarte ones are so so good
I would totally repurchase these when I
run out so I feel like this has been an
a Beauty empties in the past this is
from first aid beauty it's the facial
radiance pads
I've already repurchase these I'm
already using them I mean since I first
bought these I have not had them not in
my collection because I think they are
that good so they say the help exfoliate
tone and brighten first day beauty is
really good for sensitive skin which I
do have sensitive skin I like to use it
it just really makes your face feel so
clean like squeaky clean I love it I
travel with them all the time I just
think they're so good I always have
these around
always always so I had to get rid of a
pair of lashes these are from doto
lashes they were in the style D 105 I
really liked these lashes the band was a
little a little hard to take you to hold
up but once I finally felt like I was
getting a hang in the band
I like the lashes a lot more the D 105
weren't totally my style but sometimes
when I wanted to like step outside my
comfort zone I found myself reaching for
these lashes but they just got reused
and abused and it was finally time to to
let them go to their final resting place
I think doh-doh lashes are only like
five dollars so they're pretty
inexpensive I don't think I would do the
same style the d 105 but maybe if I
found something a little like wispier I
would do them but yeah my daughter
lashes gotta go this is another product
that I feel like is probably in every
single Beauty empties video it's for a
button Neutrogena their makeup remover
cleansing towelettes I go through these
like crazy I travel with them I use them
on nights really
I get home late and I don't feel like
hick and go through my whole skincare
regime I just take my makeup off with
the cleansing towelette so you need to
have the Neutrogena wants are probably
my favorites I just these are the ones
that I'm obviously very purchasing I
love them so this is from Tarte this was
their clean slate timeless smoothing
primer I got like a little deluxe size
like from when I ordered from Ulta if
you ordered so much Tarte you got the
free deluxe primer and it's totally
empty and I'm actually bummed I'm not a
huge primer person and I say it a lot
like sometimes I even forget to put
primers on like I'm a bad primer person
but this one was really good and I had a
really good scent to it but it was very
smoothing like it definitely reminded me
of the make up forevers smoothing primer
that everyone loves that I myself love
it really reminded me of that and once I
started getting low on it I found myself
like using it more sparingly and
sparingly because I was like no I don't
I don't want to run out of it so I was
kind of shocked even though it is a
deluxe size so it was smaller it was
still I mean it was a decent size and I
went through it so I actually would
repurchase this one as a full size I
thought it was really good so if you
need a new good smoothing primer check
out the Tarte one so this is some more
cleansing towelettes this is from simple
it's their sensitive skin expert
cleansing facial towels this was just a
little guy it had seven wipes in there I
think it came in like a subscription box
so really the only thing that I used
these for was to like take off swatches
when I was filming videos or taking
photos or things like that that's what I
use these for I didn't use these on my
face I just tend to prefer the
Neutrogena ones form actual face two
things from Juice Beauty one I thought I
mentioned in a beauty's empty video but
maybe not it's the green apple age-defy
boy stur Iser oh no because this one I
actually did go through this one's
actually empty I had a couple things I
bought a set from Juice Beauty a skin
care set from them and I ended up not
loving some products so I think it was
my past empties video where I just was
like getting rid of the products that I
didn't love but this moisturizer I did
like they have an am one that I didn't
like what this one was for p.m. I
thought it was a nice moisturizer I mean
I'm not gonna say it's my favorite and
I'm not going to repurchase this the
only thing that
really blew me away from juice beauty
was their full strength apple peel
that's the only thing that I would
repurchase from them it was still fine
it was nice to try out juice beauty in a
set but um not enough for me to
repurchase and then the other one from
juice beauty was the green apple
brightening gel cleanser I liked this
cleanser not enough to repurchase it
though I liked that it came in a good
size because I felt like I did get a lot
of good use out of it like instead of
coming in a smaller size like the
moisturizer it came in a bit of a bigger
size again I liked it it says that
exfoliates and refines I didn't feel
like it was really exfoliating I used a
lot of different exfoliator I didn't
really feel that um I thought it was
okay for a sensitive skin as well again
I just thought it was nice it wasn't
anything that lucked out it means that I
had to repurchase but it was nice but
yeah I used these up from just beauty so
I went through a foundation which I feel
like is kind of shocking I feel like I
haven't mentioned going through a
foundation I mean I live it I don't know
if ever in any of my Beauty empties I've
mentioned a foundation so this is kind
of weird but this is from L'Oreal it's
the true Match Lumi cushion so I I kind
of struggle with this foundation because
I really did like it I really did like
it when it first came out is getting a
lot of heavy because you know cushion
foundation at the drugstore people were
kind of going wild over it so people
were kind of going crazy this is what it
looks like on the inside you have the
cushion filled up with your product here
so I went out and bought it I thought it
was really good like really good like I
I liked it I was like yeah I'm totally
you know going to repurchase this again
I think it's fantastic but it comes with
0.51 ounces of product and that is not a
lot and this is more expensive this was
like fourteen or fifteen dollars or
something for not a lot of product and I
went through it I don't feel like I use
this foundation enough to justify going
through that much product I took the
cushion out I flipped it over at one
point I was taking the cushion and
literally like squeezing it out trying
to get as much as I could onto my brush
I don't know I now that I've actually
gone through it I would not be able to
repurchase this because I don't feel
like it's worth the price like even
though it's drugstore and you
not paying 40 $50 even $30 for a
foundation I'm still paying $15 for a
foundation and going through it way too
fast in my opinion and you're not using
it that much there's other foundations
where I can't put them down like I
bought the L'Oreal True Match Lumi the
original that comes in like the glass
jar I purchased that way before this and
I wear that foundation so option and I
feel like I'm still not even close to
being done with it and this one I
already used up I'm like those doesn't
seem like a very good value to me so
even though I really like the foundation
I liked it on the face I thought the
cushion was cool I'm not gonna
repurchase it ended up not being worth
it so we're just about done I've used up
a fresh this is the soy face cleanser I
believe I got this on my birthday I'm
from the Sephora gift
I know what the suppori gift birthday
gift is this year because it's almost my
birthday so that's exciting but I used
up the soy face cleanser really liked it
I ended up really liking fresh I
remember they gave us a mass too for the
birthday gift and I really liked that
one too
I'd probably repurchase fresh maybe if
they have like a set because I'm
obsessed with like skincare sets I
probably repurchase it so this one was
so funny I got this from octa Lee to
test out this was a finalizing a
nutrition hair pack this is what it
looked like I did an Instagram video
with this I could review it over there
and like show you guys how I did it I
did not end up looking anything like the
girl most felt like mine was all like
weird and crazy and I really I wanted to
test it out because I just thought it
would be cool but B I was like what if I
find this and I really loved it like I'm
always on the search for like probably
sorry are gonna make my hair look
totally bomb and no it ended up being
white more confusing than I thought it
was going to be and basically it just
deposited the product like right at the
back of my head and nowhere else like
even though you were supposed to massage
it in and I spent a long time massaging
everything in with the hair mask on all
of the product would had a one spot on
the back of my head so then even after I
washed my hair I felt like I had like a
gray spot back there so unfortunately
this one didn't work out for me I don't
even know I think it's from dory
cosmetics it's a Korean brand but no the
revitalizing hair mask
fun to try but uh but no so this one
this was very sad the next two products
you guys might be really sad over this
was from glam glow this was their super
mud clearing treatment it was just like
a little deluxe guy but it was like a
hundred points on Sephora and I don't
know if you would be able to see I used
it one time and I cannot remember how
Ares got into it but she chewed the cap
off luckily she didn't get any actual
like product in her I was able to catch
her like like she had just you at the
cap off she didn't swallow the cap or
anything like that so it wasn't bad but
I mean she I couldn't use it again so I
was like cool I got one use out of this
like ah that dog so that was depressing
but I remember I liked it a lot I think
I would want to try it a few more times
before I would purchase a bigger size of
it because glam glow is so expensive but
I know a lot of people really like it
and I wish I'd been able to get a few
more uses out of it though maybe if it
goes back is like a point burger or
something I'll try it again but that was
a bummer okay it's getting me I stopped
selling for a little bit so that my
camera cool down and I saw that I took
her as I completely anti for the night
ricotta and it keeps working happen so
this one is incredibly sad we just had a
casualty today I know you guys are gonna
be upset about it I was real mad about
it another Beauty Blender bites the dust
and not any Beauty Blender the brand new
Sigma Beauty 3d HD blender I went out
for a lunch I came home and my husband
was like I have some bad news because
this is not the first sponge that areas
has eaten this is not the second sponge
that Ares has eaten and she always goes
after my good expensive ones why why
this isn't even on the market yet you
guys like Sigma sent me these early to
test out luckily they sent me a black
one as well that I'm I'm pretty sure is
still alive but my pink one is gone I
used to this too
times doot-doot-doot times I use this
and now I have to throw it away I'm
incredibly upset about this but I've
been raving about 3d blenders for ones
that I definitely rebuy they have so
many different like angles to them and
stuff I have a lot of videos on
Instagram using them so you can see all
of them so you can see all the different
uses for it but such a good blender
there are $15 I believe and they come on
sale late February so they might already
be for sale by the time this video goes
up but yeah don't let your dogs near
them because this is what happens don't
go out for lunch because when you come
home this is what you're gonna come home
to and then I'm pretty sure everything
else I haven't here is sheet masks
because I have a obsession with sheet
masks lately I can't stop using them so
I have a lot from SNP I love these sheet
masks I feel like I've talked about them
in a YouTube video and I gave a bunch of
way and my best of beauty 2016 giveaway
video I think it was gonna give them
away have a bunch of different kinds so
I have like the animal which is 4 it
says it recharges exhausted skin the
dragon is a soothing mask to take care
of sensitive and red skin so it's like
whatever it is that you think you need
at that moment like I remember the other
day I was so dry so I grabbed off the
outer one because it's an aqua moisture
mask to reinforce a moisture retention
of dry and water insufficient skin and I
felt like so moisturize after using that
one so I think those are my only ones
from SMP that I've use lately you can
get these at Ulta I highly recommend
these like I've been recommending these
like crazy I think it's so cool to grab
a bunch of them and then just be able to
pick and choose like whatever it is that
your need is for that night that's kind
of like how you grab your sheet mask
dude you're really good this one was a
crazy one I got this one from octillery
as well and I do have an Instagram video
so I'll try to leave a link down below
this was from Estee Lauder it was their
advanced night repair concentrated
recovery power foil mask so it was wild
because when you put it on how you put
it on like what's a visible to other
people and like when you look in the
mirror is foil so it looks like you just
have a bunch of like tin foil on your
face
so it says high-performance foil back
sheet mask creates a protective
a perfect protective barrier it allows
our potent repair technologies to
penetrate fast and deep within skin
surface and helps lock in moisture so
skin emerges more radiant and more
translucent than ever so it was really
cool I liked it because I thought that
it stayed on the face well I wasn't like
I wasn't quite sure because this was
definitely the most different face masks
that I've ever tried but the the whole
idea is like really locking in that
moisture in your skin and I mean I felt
like I looked pretty darn hydrated and
moisturize after that I don't know I
liked it I don't know how much these are
I should probably look at that I have a
feeling that like just to be honest I
probably wouldn't repurchase um because
I have a feeling I knew I looked once at
the price and I had a feeling it was
expensive and I'm like I don't know
because I have so many other sheet masks
that I like that are a little bit more
affordable but it's still a cool idea
and I was really excited to be able to
try it out so it was cool but I probably
won't mind purchase it I've also been
trying out by oval sheet masks quite a
bit so I have two here they sent me
their online diary of beauty sheet masks
which was such a cool idea and I put
them in my news that are recently too
like that's how much I really have been
enjoying the bio bell sheet masks and
I'll link it below you can get these on
Ulta I'll link the stuff that they have
because again like the SNP if she must
have like different needs for your
skincare or like whatever it is that
you're looking for that night you can
grab out a different mask which I just
thought was really neat so like this one
it says to hydrate and nourish this is
their hashtag stay gorgeous with almond
oil and vitamin E and then the other one
I used up is the hashtag after-party
which soothes and brighten skins with
blueberries and yogurt I like this
because I feel like the shape masks are
a little bit like smaller maybe and they
just fit on my face better I feel like
with a lot of sheet masks sometimes
they're so big that it doesn't look
right on my face and that kind of like
sliding around everywhere just like
doesn't fit well I didn't feel that way
with bio bells so I don't know that was
a good thing for me I guess it probably
depends on your face shape but for me it
worked out really well and I really
liked their idea of buying like the
six-pack I thought that was really cool
so I'll leave that link down below again
you can get these at all
but I've been really really happy with
bio Bell so I love the SNP sheet masks
and I loved bio bell and this one I
didn't expect to love and I actually did
I don't know if I could pick a favorite
out of those three like these three
brands that I'm talking about have
definitely become favorites of mine for
sheet masks but these were really really
good these are from too cool for school
this is the egg cream mask so this is a
firming mask with colic with collagen
and egg yolk extract inside it says it
comes with an ultra microfiber sheet it
was interesting when you open it up
because it has like a protective like
netting on it Oh Moss which I've never
seen in a sheet mask once you take that
off you put the sheet mask on what I
liked about the sheet mask again like
kind of like the bio bell where it was
kind of smaller and more fitted to the
face this actually fits to your face
like when you put it on it is on you
can't move it around so you want to
really make sure you're putting it in
the right spot because once you put it
down I don't know how it does it but it
it is on your skin I thought that was so
cool I could you know I could move
around I could probably do a workout
with this mask on and it wasn't gonna go
anywhere I thought that was so cool and
it just yeah I felt really good on the
skin you know I did all that good stuff
that it said that it should do and it
says highly concentrated egg yolk
extract in enriched collagen delivered
deep nourishment to sagging skin to
increase elasticity and firmness again
I've been really happy with the sheet
masks I would totally repurchase them to
fix dollars for a sheet mask which I do
think is pricey you can get these at
Sephora so I'll leave them a link down
below but honestly I think they're
really good I have been recommending
these and I think that they're really
good I would totally get more of these I
have one more I think that I still need
to use but then I think I would want to
keep these ever on in my collection so
the too-cool-for-school brand yeah these
guys these guys have been good I would
repurchase these but I have a deep love
for sheet masks clearly I love using
them a sheet mask about three times a
week maybe I would say and SMP bio Bell
and now too-cool-for-school I definitely
see myself repurchasing from all three
of these brands and I would hide
they recommend each one yes that's gonna
