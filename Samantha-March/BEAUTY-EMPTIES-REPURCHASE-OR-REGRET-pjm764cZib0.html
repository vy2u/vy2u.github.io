today's video is finally going to be a
new beauty inside the video this is way
overdue my little trashcan that I keep
in my office is overflowing I can't
remember the last time I did an empties
video it has been a while so I'm really
excited to finally empty the trash can
and show you guys everything that I've
been using up I call my empties a
repurchase or regrets because I will let
you know the products that I have used
up and if I do buy them or if it ended
up being not so good for me I love
watching empties videos and I love
making them because it's so interesting
to me to see what people are actually
going through and then what they think
about it when they have used a product
up so I hope that you guys find this
helpful are new to my channel welcome
and thank you for clicking on this video
I am posting every single day right now
because I have so much to talk about and
just so many video ideas in mind and
then I also have these videos like my
empties that I just need take it out
there so if you guys like a lot of
chatter about makeup a lot of makeup
reviews this makeup tutorial we'll be
going up tomorrow if you're interested I
hope that you will consider hitting the
subscribe button to get notified when I
do post my video but without further ado
why don't we go ahead and jump into this
overflowing trash can on top I have a
couple of lashes so if you guys have
been watching my blog series I have been
like organizing my makeup collection and
also doing some cleaning so a lot in
here is stuff that I really have just
been decluttering getting rid of that I
don't use a lot anymore I think I have a
lot in here from my bathroom as well
because I recently cleaned out my
bathroom - I like a wild hair one day
and which ham on my bathroom so I have a
bunch of lashes here so these are both
ardell lashes I don't even know if I
could tell you with the style but I just
something about our del lashes I'm just
not into them anymore I just don't seem
to like how they look on my eyes I feel
like they're not as easy to put on
anymore I'm not sure what's going on but
I am like ride or die for my pur
cosmetics lashes them on today in the
style of bombshell and I just find them
so easy and it's like since I was using
them I just can't go back to the art
del-one
it's something about the band I'm not
finding helpful and I don't I just don't
like the way they look at me anymore so
I got rid of
a couple of my ardell lashes and then I
also put in here at the Idol or Lux
lashes and gilded I mentioned this in a
monthly makeup video maybe two months
ago and I said it was a fail and I just
note like I always have so many lashes
that I just don't need to keep around
lashes that I'm not using and then I
have another style and I lure these were
in collaboration with Vegas nay and
these are the shining star lashes I
really did like these lashes but they
are just old I'm just simply getting rid
of them I don't think I would repurchase
them though just because I'm finding
other lashes that I love way more so I
don't even though I like these they just
they weren't my favorite so I don't
think I would repurchase them may I have
a ton of sheet masks in here we're
probably going to keep finding sheet
masks as we go through them I try to
grab the ones that are on top but I will
run through these quickly I have quite a
love for sheet masks so I have quite a
few from bio belt cosmetics this one is
in the state gorgeous to hydrate and
nourish I'm sure I have more viable ones
here's another one sometimes with sheet
masks I do forget to throw them in my
little trashcan though I try to remember
this one is the after party to soothe
and brighten skin I really do like that
one I like to buy the bio bailed masks
and be like my diary said it comes with
a pack of six and I just really like
them they all do different things to
hydrate or soothe or anti aging things
like that so I'll leave it linked down
below they can be found at Ulta or I do
have a discount code now with bio Belle
if you buy them from their website I'll
leave it on the screen here because I
can't remember off the top of my head
but it also it's always in the
description box down below any of my
discount codes are always found in my
description box but I was so happy to
get that because I love their sheet
masks I recommend them all the time and
I know a lot of you guys have been
saying that you're buying them this one
is a sheet mask from a bow Tanic farm
it's their natural energy mask it was a
tea tree mask they send me a couple of
she wants to try which I am doing so I
don't have clear thoughts on botanic
farm yet I have a bunch from
pathology on my gosh I have quite a few
from pathology actually so I have
they're smart mud masks which is which
is awesome like if you love mud masks
but you hate how dirty they are is a mud
mask but in a sheet
so it's not dirty so you don't get your
sink filthy you don't get you filthy you
don't get mud in your hair huh it's like
it's amazing so so cool another sheet
mask to have from them is their slash
mask hydrate this is a 5-minute Mac I've
been loving technology I just mentioned
on before in favourites videos as well
but I love pathology because I feel like
they are like geared towards me because
they have a lot of like 5 or 10-minute
masks instead of 15-20 half-hour masks
like really quick working masks which I
appreciate very much like sometimes I
don't have time to spend 20 minutes you
know on our sheet masks so they're
hydrate mask is really really nice I
also have a couple patches in here
from their lift gel which is this is
what I had in a favorites video not too
long ago they're a lip mask and I love
them especially from when I was dealing
with really like dry cracked lips I
think maybe I just had like an allergic
reaction to like a lip gel thing that I
used once and these masks really didn't
help me out or if you wear liquid
lipsticks a lot they really help or if
you're like a youtuber if you do lip
swatches these could like legit save
your life
I have a oh this is the posh peel
pedicure oh man so this is like a peel
for your feet I've done it in the past
I've done it with a geology maybe like 4
or 5 months ago but I did it again the
other night and this time I actually
filmed it I filmed it so hopefully if it
comes out ok you'll see it on Instagram
it's really gross but it's also like
really cool at the same time because it
like literally peels dead skin off your
feet it's wild and then I have another
bio bail sheet mask this is that a
primer sheet mask which i think is
really really cool but again I like this
mess because it's only 5 minutes but it
basically will prime your skin so
instead of having to use a different
sort of primer you get it in a sheet
mask and it has tea tree oil roses
extract and vitamin C so I again file
Bell tautology some of my favorite brand
right here if you can't tell I use a lot
of their product cuz I said about this
this is from colour-pop and it was their
get paid gel liner I still had liner
left but I opened it up one day and it
just scooped it fell right out and I was
really sad I need to see if they still
have this available on our website so I
know they
get rid of things like crazy was it
really pretty metallic rose gold
eyeliner and it was one of my favorites
oh so sad I mean it's only five dollars
and I definitely got my five dollars out
of it but I need another one we got
another thing from pathology actually
went through a whole box of their lip
masks and I think I have like two or
three boxes left so the five minute
hydrogel for your lips I went through an
entire box so there's that it is from a
first aid beauty it's our ultra Repair
Cream intense therapy so it's like a
really thick lotion I really like this
it took me a while to get through this
whole bottle I really liked it
especially in the winter because it
really is good for intense hydration
when I have really dry skin in the
winter time so mostly what I was
reaching for it helps combat that and
this is really nice I really enjoy first
aid beauty if they can be found at
Sephora and Ulta and I would repurchase
that I really like that brand another
thing I actually heard from first aid
beauty is their facial radiance polish
to exfoliate brighten and purify I would
also repurchase this I put this in my
shower
it's an exfoliator but first a beauty is
really good for sensitive skin which I
have so even though it is an exfoliator
and have like the granules and beads in
it it's not too harsh and it didn't
leave my skin really red or like how it
felt stripped so I would repurchase that
as well I really enjoyed that so I see a
couple things that I decluttered from my
bathroom so this one is a deodorant this
is from honestly fresh it's they're
fairly sweet deodorant I mentioned them
in a makeup monthly and I put the
roll-on deodorant in my fine section if
I can find that video I'll leave it
linked down below but this one is like
the actual stick deodorant and I did not
like that this is a natural deodorant
I'll have the unclean fresh website
listed down below of course in case you
are interested in switching to a natural
deodorant but the stick form I did not
like it kind of actually hurts to put it
on it was almost like you couldn't just
rub the do and or no you had to like
kind of scrape it your underarm and it
hurt and then it like jumped up really
weird and it just didn't really like
look at like look at I don't know like
can you see that that was active just a
few uses and I'm like I don't know what
that's about but I don't really want to
keep putting that on so I switch to the
roll-on which I like a lot more but yeah
this one was not so good for me this is
a creme styling mousse for your hair
it's being
your mother's whip it up I got this in
an influencer box like last summer I
think it was and it was okay it's
actually pretty much empty but I kind of
stopped using it because I thought it
made my hair like tingly I will use a
mousse sometimes if I'm in a hurry I
just skip conditioner and then I'll just
change with my hair and put mousse in it
and it kind of gives me that like curly
look that you'll see in some of my
videos but with this one mousse just I
found it was really just making my hair
tangley which I didn't appreciate but I
almost use the whole thing regardless so
FML it smells really good I remember
that part though I'm going to get rid of
that one and I wouldn't repurchase that
they also in here I have this pixie
beauty sleeping cream so I really like
pixie and the majority of their products
are a hit for me but this one it was
just the packaging that didn't work
because the pump
works for me like the first two times
and then the pump stopped working so if
I wanted to use it I was having to like
take this little guy out and then having
to like squeeze it onto my hand I tried
it a few more times and I was like you
know what I have other sleeping creams
and night creams like I'm just going to
get rid of this because it's kind of
ridiculous and I don't want to work that
hard for a project so unfortunately the
Pixies beauty sleeping cream is just the
packaging that didn't work out for me I
thought otherwise it was fine but I
don't think I would repurchase it again
I just have other night creams for
sleeping creams that I have found that I
liked more so that one was from pixie
moving a lawn I have this from OGS it's
they're weightless oil and lifting tonic
I really really enjoyed this I would
repurchase this there's a little bit
less but it's like so far at the bottom
I can barely get the spray to work
anymore and I did actually just replace
this with something really similar from
OGS but I see I really like their hair
products I wasn't sure if I would at
first but yeah they work out really well
for me I would repurchase them this is a
self tanner this is from Greyson Stella
it's their bronze doll self tanning
spray I did not like this at all so
there's still a lot left I only tried it
about maybe three times because I tried
to give it a fair shot but it just
wasn't for me
I have tried more from grace and Stella
and I have like two most of their
products but this one this one was no
good for me some skincare in here from
Miceli CLE it's they're just actually
smooth multi-action my
elcome gel cleanser I really enjoyed
this brand I use it almost every single
day I have one of their products
cleanser moisturizer mask something that
I'm using every single day it is pretty
pricy skincare and they have sent me a
couple really nice packages in the past
but I have really really been a fan of
their skincare to send me a new cleanser
which I was super excited about I would
repurchase it I just wish it wasn't so
pricey but my skin really gets on with
their brand ok I have some dry shampoo
this is from Kenna it's just a little
guy that I picked it up to try because
I'm pretty particular with my dry
shampoos I didn't really love this I
just didn't think it really did anything
for my hair recently I've been using the
way dry psalm shampoo and I like that a
lot better so there's still quite a bit
in here but I just don't need it anymore
and I didn't love it from Dermalogica
this is their a nightly lip treatment
this is what I can't decide if it I
don't know I don't know if I had an
allergic reaction to it I'm not sure
what happened but when I use this my
lips for I want to say three weeks were
like cracked open were like peeling I
had redness all around my lips and they
hurt they hurt so bad it was right after
I use this too so I know this was the
culprit so I'm getting rid of this for
sure and I would not buy it and I don't
I don't know what it was but no this has
got to go up some of the tarts under-eye
rescue patches the under eye patches I
really like these I have repurchased
these in the past because I really do
like them I really love cooling under
eye gels I just so I always have some on
my collection and the Tarte ones are
really nice I have another sheet mask
from bio bell business they're a happy
hour which helps to minimize signs of
aging telling you I love those sheet
masks I do at least I would say probably
like two a week yes I also have a lip
balm this is from covergirl it's there
Oh sugar in cupcake I really enjoyed
this I kind of bought it on a whim I
kind of thought the packaging was cute
but I always have a lip balm near my
desk and I ended up really getting on
with this so I would repurchase this one
I thought this was really nice through
some makeup wipes these are the simple
my seller
makeup removing wipes I did like these
guys I think they are good for sensitive
skin yes they are good for sensitive
skin so I did like familya I would
repurchase them as well I think I got
these from targets have an ice cream in
here from Lancer it's the eye contour
lifting cream I know this was said to me
I want to say it was with acally and I
remember looking at the price event one
time on Sephora and I remember thinking
it was super super expensive now I love
eye creams and I wear an eye cream every
night but I really don't know like
sometimes there's an eye dream that I
think maybe I'm seeing something out of
it but other times I kind of feel like
maybe they all kind of work the same so
I want to repurchase this one because
I'm pretty sure I remember being very
expensive and I really like my pixie
ones that I'm using right now but I
won't do the whole thing and that's a
big jar so looks pretty good I really do
wear an eye cream every night I see
another sheet mask in here oh yeah this
one was from leaders of their advanced
to bio cellulose mask I think I got this
in one of my lip multi-vise which was
kind of fun that it came with a sheet
mask I remember I really did like it I
felt like it fit nice on to the face
which I can't always be said what's a
sheet mask but I've only tried once so
like right now I don't feel like I would
need to repurchase them because I like
buy oval and catch ology so much but I
felt that it was a good sheet mask I
think you can get leaders at Ulta I
think this was a skin towel it was the
charcoal exfoliating towels from the
skin towel I didn't really love this it
was sent to me for review and it
basically was just like a big not a big
towel is bigger than like a hand towel
it's a little square but it was smaller
than like the bigger hand toe don't know
what they're called for shirk so I'm on
domestic goddess for sure but it was
like an okay size but it was supposed to
be like easy to like just wash your
whole body with and I was supposed to
have some sort of like charcoal
exfoliating going on I didn't notice
anything I didn't notice anything at all
I feel like I was just rubbing my body
with a regular towel and I was very
confused so I would not repurchase this
I didn't quite get an interesting
concept but I don't really get it we
don't look at that we have more shapes
in here
this one is from too cool for school
with our egg cream mask I do really like
these two they aren't
expensive but they can be found at
Sephora I do like them and I feel like
they're very interesting and these ones
are like super tight to the face like
once you put these on it's like it's not
going anywhere which I appreciate a lot
they're just a little bit on the pricey
side but I really do like them and I
have repurchased them I think we're
going to end it with even more heat maps
I'm pretty sure that's all that's at the
bottom of this trash can
so from bio Belle we have the beauty
scoop face mask I have more patch ology
lip gel
cause I'm Tanya I use those all the time
oh here's one from S&amp;amp;P I love the sp the
animal face mask with the koala one for
hydration yeah I really like those too
if those can be found at Ulta also I
really do like them more in here from
BIOS oh we have the beauty secret we
have the pathology illuminate flash mask
yep use those another lip renewal I'm
telling you guys I go through these like
crazy all more tarts under eye masks I
do I do go through quite a bit and then
the final item in my trash can but you
guys can't guess what it is can you
it's a vial bail sheet back look at that
I think like 70% of my garbage was she
masks this is the iowa kelp with Wild
Rose and vitamin C again I just one of
my favorite sheet masks so that is
everything from my Beauty empty and I
think me as long as I thought it was
going to which I enjoy but now I have an
empty trash can that is ready to see you
filled up again okay so that is going to
be everything for my latest Beauty
empties video I really hope that you
