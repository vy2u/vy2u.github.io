today's video is going to be a new
empties video so we have a little big
trash can here filled with some makeup
Beauty skincare items that I have used
up or I do not want any more i want to
get rid of so i like to call my empties
the repurchase or regret video because
i'm able to like fully review and let
you guys know if I really like to
product if I just like to product since
it's empty what i use it up again or was
it something that I really didn't love
so I love doing empties videos I'm going
to be trying to do them more on my
channel and I love watching them there's
some of my favorite videos to watch
because I feel like you can really get a
good idea of someone's full review in
full feedback if they've completely used
up a product so I think there are a lot
of fun to do but if you would like to
see my empties and what is in my trash
can please keep watching it's all right
on the top I see some makeup remover
wipes so this one is from yes which i
think you get these at target their
cleansing facial wipes it came with 10 I
think this came in like a subscription
box and then another one is from simple
it's their sensitive skin cleansing
facial wipes again I think this came I
think this one came in a beauty combox
and this one might have come at my
target beauty box but I love makeup
remover wipes I really do these ones I
did not like to use around my eyes I
felt like because they have like some
sort of fragrance to them it says with
apple and lemon peel to cleanse and
moisturize it irritated my eyes so after
I tried it once in my eyes I switched it
to just having in my office to like wipe
off swatches and stuff when I'm filming
these ones I really did like on the face
though these ones from simple I really
like the simple branch so I thought
those were really good so I mean if
these were like on sale at target I
maybe would get one just to have them in
my office first watches these i would
actually repurchase from a base and then
I went through a came and smooth instant
tangler from my hair this was from
victoria secret i got this so long ago
and somehow i finally went through it
it's called the so sexy style tame and
smooth with instant detangler this is
what it looks like you're supposed to be
able to use it in your
hair like after you get out of the
shower and it just makes it more
manageable to come through I thought it
was fine like i have other detanglers
and honestly it's not something that I
feel like I absolutely have to have I
really like the miracle 10 it's a
miracle whatever that little yellow
bottle is for blondes I really like that
one more this one was just okay but I
know that I definitely wouldn't
repurchase it once i found the other
miracle product because it's miracle
then also from victoria's secret this
i'm just getting rid of its there make
it last prime and sent makeup spray i
bought this when I was like fur starting
again to make up because I was like oh
everybody has these makeup setting spray
is like obviously I need one too yeah I
mean this one is maybe halfway full like
it still has a lot of product and it
best didn't do anything at all like I
remember when I first bought this like I
said I was first getting it to make up
and I used it and I was like what does
everybody spring on their face because
they're all getting played what are they
doing so no this one this one was
definitely a regret I have some lashes
in here that I had to say goodbye to
these are my who to beauty lashes in
Samantha I love these lashes so much and
they were just they were getting to be
on their last limb I did already
repurchase these I got the extravagant
eyes sephora favorite set and it came
with these lashes and that was one of
the main reasons i bought that set
because i love these lashes i will
continue to repurchase them it was so
funny because the last time i used him
in my head I was like this is probably
the last time I'm going to be able to
use these lashes and it was so crazy
because as I was getting ready to put
them on I grabbed one with my tweezers
and because they were just like so done
for when I grabbed it with my tweezers
it actually snapped the lash in half I
was like whoa whoa I was not expecting
that so these lashes got to go but some
of my favorite favorite lashes have some
sheet masks in here and these are from
SNP I recently talked about these sheet
masks in a favorites video i love them i
went through the panda one and the
rabbit one and i went through one other
one and i remember i threw it away I
threw the package away and I was like no
right and that's when I put my trash can
out I just put it right in my office
like it looks like it might be like a
regular trash can but if you look inside
it's only full of makeup updates but
it's to help me remind myself instead of
just throwing stuff away to put it in
here so I could talk about it but these
face masks I think our bomb I love them
you can get them at Ulta I'll leave them
link down below I thought they did such
a good job I can link my favorites video
where I go more into depth on them but
especially the panda one I felt like I
just loved the panda mass so much but
they're super hydrating and each mask
does a different task so like the animal
panda mask is a brightening master
restored dull and rough skin and then
the rabbit mask was a brightening face
mask to replenish luminosity and
softness supplying hydration for Dalton
rough skin they have a lot of other
different animals in each mask like
actually like kind of looks like that
animal so it's like fun at the same time
but these turned into like some of my
favorite masks I love them I have some
skincare in here from juice beauty I did
do a snatch it or scratch it video on a
juice beauty set that i purchased and i
have two items in here one is their
green apple age defy serum so when i
talked about it in the snatcher of
scratch it video i said that there's
just not enough product in here what was
in here like point point two five fluid
ounces I mean there was just barely any
product to be able to get out anyways
but then the pump on it never actually
works I had to always unscrew this can I
even do it I had to always unscrew it
and take out the product that way it was
just a mess I maybe got like five uses
out of it and then all the product was
gone anyways like this was more annoying
than anything so that one is done can
get rid of that one I will not be
repurchasing that and then the other
thing from juice beauty that I'm just
getting rid of because I didn't like it
I didn't even go through this whole
little guy but once I got done with my
testing period which is like three or
four weeks that I tested it out so I
could do the video on it I was like nope
i'm getting rid of this it's still i can
just see it it's over halfway full still
but i'm like i did not like this it's
their green apple brightening SPF
moisturizer so it's a facial moisturizer
with SPF in it which is great and that's
what I look for in a moisturizer I
always want to make sure my wish
users have SPF because that's good but
it's like putting sunscreen on your face
I mean I'll have the whole video link
down below if you want to check it out I
did like some of the items in there from
juice beauty and some of them actually
turn into a favorite but these two
products would just really underwhelmed
me and I like I truly I cannot even
finish using this it's like putting the
sunscreen on your face it was just white
and gunky hard to move around it didn't
make my skin feel any better it was just
a key so I'm just not even going to keep
trying to pretend to use it it came with
a different moisturizer in the set which
I like a lot but the one with the SPF
was no good and then some more skin care
this is from belief it's a Hungarian
water essence it says it's an apple
based formulation to increase hydration
level this is what it looks like it's
like a deluxe sample i believe i got
this is like a 100-point / con sephora i
was just really curious about it I love
this and I can't say that I understand
it I mean because it says it's Hungarian
water essence and I'm like what does
that even mean am I just putting water
on my face what what exactly am I
putting on my face and my husband said I
liked it so much because it's Hungarian
and if you guys don't know we have a
vizsla and her name is Aries and the
actual breed of visual estare called
hungarian fishless just just a little
backstory but when I was telling my
husband I was like I don't understand
why I like this so much he's like
Hungarian like oh ok i getcha but it
says applied evenly to face and neck
after cleansing and toning I seriously I
don't I don't know what it is that this
is supposed to do but I freaking love it
like when my face is feeling really
drive I've had this for a while it's
taking me a while to get through it and
it's probably because the colder months
are coming like when I get out of the
shower or I get done washing my face or
sometimes just in the middle of the day
if I'm feeling really dry I'm like I'm
gonna go put that water stuff on my face
again and I finally gone through the
whole little bottle and I honestly think
that I would repurchase this I actually
just found a set from belief on the
Sephora website and I think I want to
get that I want to double check and see
if it has this in there because I don't
know I kind of feel silly buying like a
full
sighs but just because I'm like what
what is this and why do I like it so
much it just to me it kind of seems like
a moisturizer type of thing like it's
bringing hydration back into your face
and just making my skin feel good again
but I get it again if I saw it as like a
point park again I would get it or if I
saw it like included and a belief said I
would probably get it and try out more
belief i do here really good things
about the brand so this was kind of like
a weird hidden gem for me so this is
from vs spa it's their gradual tanning
face moisturizer I got a little sample
in like I think was my beauty comp box
and I went through it I actually just
got a full size of this so this one I
think is really good I mentioned it in
my last favorites video as well first of
all was kind enough to send me a whole
package of goodies and include it was a
full size of this face moisturizer I
absolutely love it I just think it's
really good it smells good it feels good
on the skin and then it also is
gradually canning your skin so I got a
bunch from the vs bots line and I've
been using it out to like gradually tan
my body as well I've been loving it but
yeah I went through this little guy real
quick through some eyelash adhesive no
shock this was just a little guy of duo
it's their dark tone adhesive I've
already repurchased this because this is
probably one of my favorite eyelash
adhesives I just think it's really good
you can get dual really inexpensive at
like drugstores or I think they even
have it at target so yeah I've already
repurchased one of these but no shock
that I went through this because I wear
lashes very frequently and then I am
almost finished but the next one in here
is a product that broke it's the
wet'n'wild Omega glow contouring palette
I have mine in Dolce de leche it
shattered on me I don't know what
happened I must have dropped my makeup
bag when I was traveling and when I got
home I opened it and I was like no
because this is one of my favorites I
actually just mentioned it in my last
favorites video because I said I went
out and repurchased a new one so I love
this I think it's amazing obviously I
had to go repurchase it luckily its drug
store when wild very inexpensive so it
wasn't too bad to replace but uh I was
so sad and then I have some mascaras in
here that I
used up one is from tarte it's the
lights camera lashes mascara so this
mascara gets so much hype and talked
about so much and everybody loves it and
I actually didn't like it at all I mean
it was like a struggle to remember to
use it and i pretty much only used it to
like prep my lashes for false lashes
because it just really didn't do
anything for me so this was definitely
regret and I will not be repurchasing
that one the other one that I went
through is from Lancome I mean like all
of the writing is like wore off on here
but I believe I'm saying it correctly
that this was the Hypnose drama I
actually got this one in a Sephora
favorites like lash stash and I loved it
it actually turned into like one of my
favorite mascaras i would actually
repurchase this in a full size and
that's weird to say because that's just
weird to say i don't purchase a ton of
mascaras I like to get them in sets or I
get like these little mini guys to try
out because I were so many false lashes
luckily just always have false lashes on
so I don't really care very much to have
mascara the blue bottom like when
they're on sale and stuff but definitely
if I solve this one on sale I would
actually pick it up I thought it was
really really nice mascara sorry
different opinions on those at mascaras
but then the last items I have to go
through i have three in here and there
at the bottom and the sport garbage can
is kind of icky at the bottom but Beauty
blenders I'm very sad about some of them
this one is a real techniques they're
like miracle sponge and it's just old
like it's starting to rip and when your
beauty blenders start to rip you know
you need to you need to throw them away
but really it is it's just old like even
when I washed it it would like take so
long to like go back to its shape so
this was just old has to be thrown away
but these two I'm not very happy about
this one in particular because if you
can see why I'm throwing them away some
dog named Aries decided to eat them I'm
so mad like this one I'm not quite as
mad because these are only like 7 99 or
something at Alta but this is a Beauty
Blender this was one of the nude beauty
blenders and I loved it I loved using it
and these are twenty dollars so when I
caught her
this one I was like you are so lucky you
are cute and I love you with all of my
heart so yeah so I had to say goodbye to
these beauty blenders I mean obviously
neither of them were ready to go yet
they are gone too soon but I have picked
up the Real Techniques diamond sponge
which I love even more than this and i
also got a black beauty blender which I
actually think I love even more than the
nude ones so they have been replaced I
really like real techniques and beauty
blender for my makeup sponges and I use
them almost on the daily so of course i
had to repurchase those but after that
that is it my trash can is back to being
empty and ready to get filled up with
some more empties so and that's going to
be it for my most recent empties video I
really hope that you guys enjoy these
videos because I like to make them and I
love to watch them like I said I just
like to get people's feedback on
products that they've used up or
products that they just are getting rid
of they don't even want in their
collection anymore and I had a few of
those in here as well but hopefully you
found this video helpful or enjoyable in
some way if you did I hope that you'll
give it a big thumbs up also i hope that
you will subscribe before you go maybe
even click that little bow down there
somewhere down there so you get notified
for my future videos but thank you guys
so much for watching and i'll catch you
very soon in my next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
