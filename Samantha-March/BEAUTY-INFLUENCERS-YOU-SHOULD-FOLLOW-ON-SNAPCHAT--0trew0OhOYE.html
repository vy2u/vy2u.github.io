today's video is going to be all about
two beauty influencers that I think and
you should be following on snapchat I
did this video about a month ago or so
and I did it on beauty brands that I
think that you should follow on snapchat
some of my favorite brands that are
really active over on the app and I
asked if you'd want to see this type of
video but talking about bootie
influencers beauty bloggers youtubers
and you guys said yes and I just got a
comment the other day asking when this
video is coming I thought okay I'm gonna
go ahead and film it so I do have a 10
and different Beauty influencers that I
want to talk to you about that I love
following over on the snapchat app and
that I would highly recommend you follow
if you are not following yet so without
further ado why don't I go ahead and
jump into it so I also recently posted a
video about Beauty youtubers that I
watch in love I featured 20 different
youtubers over there so I'll have that
video linked down below as well you're
gonna see a lot of repeats in this video
I tried to choose the beauty influencers
who I feel like are really active over
on snapchat you know some of my favorite
Beauty youtubers that I watch there you
just aren't super active over on that
app so I really try to choose those that
I think are the most active and some of
the most of fun to watch so to get it
started I'm gonna talk about my friend
Olivia from the level of her makeup I
absolutely love Liv I find her
hysterical and I think her snapchat is
just like her youtube she is very
uncensored she is very unfiltered she's
gonna tell you what she thinks in her
snapchat and I just really enjoyed that
about her she also has not only one
fairy but now she just got another
ferret so she's got two ferrets always
running around in her snapchats which
are just is so funny to watch she
typically has really long snapchat
stories I love that I know that I can
just sit down click on her snapchat
story and she's gonna tell me the whole
story she's gonna talk to me about her
day she's gonna let me know makeup she's
wearing what skincare she's wearing her
snapchat is very informative
yet at the same time very fun and
there's always lots of makeup and beauty
related items over there in her snapchat
I will have each of these snapchat names
of each influencer that I'm talking
about over here and then I will also
have them a link down below if you do
want to add them on snapchat so
hopefully you find that helpful but that
is the first one I want to recommend
Olivia from
Liv loves her makeup and so next time I
want to talk about SL miss glam or SL
miss glam Beauty I absolutely love
watching her YouTube videos as well they
are just so
cheery and full pastels and color and
that is exactly what her snapchat is
like too they remind me exactly of her
videos she does own her own brush
company which i think is super cool you
can tell in her snaps like she was just
a girl boss and I think that's amazing
she's always showing us sneak peeks of
her brushes and she's always showing
like the most gorgeous photos sometimes
I just screenshot her photos on snapchat
just because I want some in spell even
though I feel like I just don't have it
in me to decorate the way she does
because she's just the absolute cutest
but she also does have a ton of
giveaways over on her snapchat as well
she's always trying to do giveaways for
her brushes are for her brush books
which i think is really really awesome
so if you haven't checked out SL miss
glam yet I highly recommend you do if I
want to talk about my friend at Kendall
or Kendall elfrid she is actually a
newer channel to me she was recommended
by a ton of you guys when I was asking
for beauty youtuber recommendations a
few months back I found so many new
youtubers through just asking that
question which I thought was so amazing
but Kendall was one who I started
watching her videos I immediately
subscribed and then I immediately went
added her on snapchat always do that
sometimes I just forget and then I see
somebody also on YouTube talking about
their snapchat I'm like oh yeah I need
to remember I had them on snapchat but I
added Kendall right away because I just
immediately felt some sort of like click
with her I feel like that she's very
down to earth and very relatable and I
just I really enjoy watching her videos
she loves to try new makeup she loves to
talk about new makeup and over on her
snapchat she really enjoys swatching and
it's funny because I was just watching
her snapchat this morning and she's
watching a bunch of Oprah highlighter so
I was like salivating I wrote into her
and I was like girl you're all those
highlighters I think I wrote something
like holy ish or something to the head
to that extent but I feel like she's
doing a lot of swatches over on her
snapchat a lot of times they're
highlights which are like one of my
weaknesses at this moment I think that
her snapchat is super fun to watch and
as always with everyone that I'm
mentioning I will also link their
YouTube channel down below in my
description box as well as their
snapchat name but I highly recommend you
check out Kendall Alford as well I want
to talk about Jessica Braun our Jam
Beauty 89 over here on YouTube I love
watching Jessica snaps she's always
talking about makeup of course like a
lot of these are but she gives a lot of
reviews over on her snap
as well time she takes us through her
morning routine as well what she's gonna
be wearing that day she'll do check-ins
I also really enjoy watching her snaps
because her husband is a travel agent
and they do a lot of traveling and she
snaps a lot when she is traveling and
she was just that it was either Disney
World or Disneyland I can't remember
which one she was at she was just there
all these snaps like I was watching them
I like a fanatic I have been to Disney
World
once it was just like a couple of years
ago talking to a work trip with my
husband but I was still watching her
SABS like just in awe because I love the
Disney Princesses I was having so much
fun I felt like I was there so I feel
like that's really cool because you get
a ton of makeup talk with Jessica you
get a ton of reviews over there and you
know swatches and things like that but
at the same time she's always traveling
with her husband and then she takes you
along with the trips which i think is
really awesome as well so I wanted to
check out for sure for your snapchat is
Jessica Braun or Jam beauty 89 so I want
to talk about Shae or that girl Shae XO
over here on YouTube I love watching
shade feel like she is always happy I
feel like she always has such a positive
outlook about any situation and of
course that's not to say like she's just
you know she never gets down or she
never has a bad day because of course
that's not possible but I feel like
she's someone who really just she has
that general positive outlook on life I
feel like I get that from her YouTube
videos and I also feel like I get that
from her snapchat she's always just
happy about something or something is
making her day or something is good and
I know when I watch her snapchats I'm
just gonna be like yeah everything is
okay that's kind of the vibe that I get
from Shay so I just really enjoyed
watching her she's someone who's also
recently engaged I loved seeing that the
snaps of her and her fiance alok out and
about like I feel like I could
definitely be friends with the veep
everyone that I'm speaking about but
Shay as well I feel like I could be
friends up there I'm so excited for her
upcoming wedding she also cracks me up
because she's not afraid to smack when
she gets a couple drinks in her and then
her snapchat really crack me up you got
to check out that girl Shay on snap I
said I want to talk about Stephanie or
Babs beauty here on YouTube
her snaps man her snaps are something
else if you love makeup if you love
seeing new makeup new releases if you
love watching hauls like if that's one
your favorite things to watch on YouTube
is Hall you have to add her on your
snapchat because she is always hauling I
would say at least every other night she
has like an hour long story on her
snapchat doing hauls a lot of it she
buys herself like she is such a huge
makeup fanatic and she's always talking
about it a lot of it is orders that she
is placing and I love that she always is
trying to find indie brands too I feel
like I'm always hearing about new
companies our new products through her
snapchat but she also gets a ton of PR
cuz she has so many subscribers over
here on YouTube she gets a ton of PR she
goes through everything she swatches
everything I just think that's really
cool a big reason why I really love the
snapchat app is because I feel like you
get a different side of everybody
because snapchat to me just feels a
little bit more personal or over here on
YouTube you know you're doing your
makeup and your hair and you got your
outfit on and you're setting up your
lights and your camera and getting
everything ready and you need to hit
your points in your video and all of
that but over on snapchat it's much more
relaxed it's personal you're just
hanging out with your friends and I feel
like through snapchat I've really gotten
to see a different side of Stephanie
when I first started watching her
channel she was like 99% tutorials and a
lot of them were voiceovers so it's
really hard to get someone's personality
when they're really just doing makeup on
camera and then they're talking over it
really cool when i didÃ¤Ã´t her on
snapchat that I was like oh I finally
you know can kind of see the real her
and see who she really is and I really
do feel a connection with her I've
talked about her a lot on my channel it
really felt like I I could get more of a
connection with her the Midwest girl I
love seeing her go to all of her
concerts I love her dogs so much they
are super cute and I also love her
husband he's very active on her snapchat
as well and he is always cracking me up
those two together just make me laugh I
would love to go out with them for a
night because they really do crack me up
but she is definitely one Stephanie from
Babs Beauty you gotta add her over on
snapchat I almost finished we have a
four more left to go next I want to talk
about Amanda and Singh a minute is super
interesting to follow on snapchat
because I feel like she's definitely not
someone who is afraid to get personal
over there it's like I said it's tough
one of the reasons why I like snapchat
because I feel like people are just a
little bit more relaxed over there and
I'm including myself in that as well
you're just a little bit more relaxed
and I think one thing with snapchat of
why people can feel such a close
connection with those who followed them
on snapchat is because someone has to
really go and find your snapchat it's
not like you're just going to stumble
upon it on your YouTube page it's not
going to be in your recommended profile
I'll click on this video you really have
to go and find them and then you have to
add them and then you have to find their
stories so you can watch what they're
saying it's not just a boom click like
you can on YouTube or Instagram or
Twitter or things like that you really
have to like take the time and search
for them so I feel like you just have to
kind of take your time and search for
them and that could be part of the
reason why people feel like their snap
fam you hear that term a lot like their
snap fam is a little bit more closer and
tighter across all the other social
media platforms but what I enjoy about
Amanda aside she is not afraid to take
an hour and sit down and talk about her
struggles and how she got past them her
how she hasn't gotten past me up but
she's still trying to work past them I
feel like those were always really
interesting at chats that she would have
and a lot of times something she was
saying was resonating with me so I would
take my time and I would sit down and I
would watch her snap story you know the
whole way through because I wanted to
hear her advice or just be able to
listen to you know almost like a friend
tell you a story about them and how they
were dealing with that particular
situation it also been really
interesting watching her move out to LA
and kind of her transition out there and
her experiences that she's having she
she takes you along on snapchat quite a
bit as well so that has also been really
interesting so if you have not added
Amanda ends thing is she is one that I
enjoy watching next up I want to talk
about Casey Holmes I adore following
Casey on snapchat
she is definitely one of my absolute
favorite youtubers to watch she was one
of the first ones that I started
watching and I just absolutely adore her
videos but I also adore her snapchats
I really really love her hugs she's got
two dogs and they are so beautiful and
she is always snapping them they have
the cutest little videos she takes
amazing photos on her snapchat by her
dogs always look so
good on her snapchat and I'm like how do
you get them to sit still like that cuz
my dog just she's always all over the
place but the videos are so cute and
she's always showing like when they get
the barkbox and the dogs are so excited
about the barkbox I just love it I feel
like sometimes I get judged on how much
I love my dog you know especially if you
have friends who don't have dogs and
they're like wow you're a weird dog
person and I feel like you get judged
but I feel like Kasey is just like me
like she loves her dogs just as much if
not even more than I do and she's
obsessed with them like I am with my dog
and I just love watching her snaps of
course at the same time we also get a
lot of makeup and beauty related snaps
over there her makeup her hauls her
little reviews it's also been really
interesting to watch her because she's
also recently gone through a move she is
recently engaged was just really
exciting and going through her wedding
planning and that has been really fun to
watch as well those are super cute and I
enjoy all of her snaps with him as well
and I'm so excited to see their wedding
and how everything turns out oh my gosh
I can't even imagine it's gonna be so
beautiful but if you are not yellowing
Casey Holmes over on snapchat you gotta
do it all right and then the last two
ladies that I'm gonna be talking about
they kind of go together I bet you guys
have no idea who I'm gonna talk about
but it is of course Katy and Desi or
luster looks desi Perkins I absolutely
love this duo they crack me up so much
and their snapchats are absolutely
hysterical I mentioned them in the
beauty youtubers that I watch in love
and I just kind of feel like Katie and
desi go together they are best friends
they recently did a collaboration with
those colors which was really exciting
and they are always on one another
snapchat just making me laugh and I feel
like Katy was one of the first ones that
I started following on snapchat like one
of the first Beauty influencers think
I've mentioned this story in a past
video as well but I actually started
following her before desi I had seen
some a desease videos and to me she just
seemed and I'm not trying to say this in
a rude way but it just it kind of seemed
like she took herself too seriously
which like I was saying sometimes you
want to come across a little bit more
professional on YouTube or you're trying
to hit all your points or show your
tutorial or do your swatches or do your
reviews it can be harder just to be kind
of like a laid-back and chill and and I
totally get that but so I just didn't
really connect with desi like I connect
with Katie's videos so she was one of
the first ones I added on snapchat and I
kept seeing this desi on her snapchat
and I was like I'm gonna add desi
snapchat I actually added desi on
snapchat before I subscribed to her
YouTube channel and once I added her on
snapchat I was like oh no I do love this
girl she's hilarious because that's kind
of how I mean that you kind of get you
kind of get a different side of everyone
from their snapchat as opposed to who
they are only behind the camera and for
their YouTube videos and those two on
snapchat really cracked me up because I
feel like they are just super
down-to-earth as they don't take
themselves too seriously like they just
they love to have fun and I mean at the
same time you know of course they're
talking about makeup and beauty and
swatches and their makeup look they can
get those snapchats where they just look
absolutely beautiful and their
highlights are on fleek and their
outfits are amazing and oh my goodness
everything is fabulous they're
absolutely slaying those photos but at
the same time like I want to insert a
photo right here they were just in New
York they're at Rihanna's binti Beauty
event and this is the snapchat that they
took afterwards and I was like this is
why this is why I love following them
this is why I look up to them so much
this is why I respect them so much
because they do not take themselves too
seriously because I can only watch so
many snapchats of people just
I can only watch so many of those so I
enjoyed that they still have those snaps
in there like they can still turn it on
and look absolutely incredible and get
those amazing shots but at the same time
they're just having fun they're being
themselves and I mean they're just
they're just a livin life man they are
11 of the life and it is super fun they
take us behind the scenes with
everything they always have a huge snap
story they're always taking us on any of
the trips that they're going to their
husbands are always on their snaps their
dogs they're always on their snaps and I
love their dogs to sell they are some of
my absolute favorite to follow on
snapchat so if you are not following it
Katy and Desi yet on snap you just got
to do it alright guys so that is going
to do it for the beauty influencers that
I think you should be following over on
snapchat I would love to know what you
thought of the recommendations of
everyone that I listed who are you
already following who do you want to add
or who are some that you love to follow
on snapchat that you think I should be
following because if I am NOT yet I will
most definitely add them I follow a lot
of people over on snapchat but I tried
to cut this video down to ten and that
was really difficult to do but I hope
that you guys enjoyed this video and
seeing as some of my recommendations of
course if you haven't added me on
snapchat yet I hope that you will I will
put my little ghost right here I'm just
amantha that March or you can pause this
video and snap this little guy to add me
over on snapchat I'm very active over

single day pretty much every single day
