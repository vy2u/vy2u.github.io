today's video is going to be all about
the youtubers that I watch and the
youtubers that I want to recommend to
you I got this video in part from my
friend Olivia from Liz loves her makeup
I'll have her video linked down below
where she talks about her youtubers that
she trusts and then it also came in part
that I actually get asked that question
a lot especially during my live chat I
actually just finished a live chat I did
a live get ready with me but I've
noticed in my life chats that I've been
doing weekly that I get asked about you
know do you watch this person or do you
watch that person I get those in my
comment section a lot but it's also a
question I have asked other people like
in their Q&amp;amp;A I say what youtubers do you
watch so I just thought it could be kind
of a fun and interesting video I'm going
to do from small channels to the really
big channels I'm just going to kind of
give a mixture of everything it was
really really hard to narrow this list
down when I first made it I had over 50
channels on my list if that tells you
how much YouTube I watch I narrowed it
down to 20 that was the best that I
could do you guys I'll let you know
about them let you know why I love them
and then everything will be linked to
all of these channels will be linked
down below I hope that you guys find
this video interesting I am a little on
the ill side if I don't look or sound
the best I haven't been feeling very
well all week so I do hope that you guys
enjoy this video I still am posting a
video every single day you enjoy getting
daily content on makeup of beauty I hope
that you will consider subscribing to my
channel but if you want to see some of
my favorite youtubers and other channels
of that I watch all of the time why
don't we go ahead and get started well
first of I'm starting with a very new
YouTube channel but the scale has been
my friend for a very long time and I was
super excited when she decided to start
a YouTube channel her name is Katie
Katie Marie Katie from my vanadate Katie
is someone who I met via Instagram I
think it was via f cos and then we met
and kind of bonded over Instagram she
has an amazing blog called from my
vanity I love her newsletters are always
very informative but she has so much
good information on her blog in her
newsletters on her Instagram page and we
just really formed the connection we
follow each other on snapchat and we
talk on with every single day
katie has also been at my moderator for
my past few live videos that I've done
she has offered to volunteer and
moderate
my life had to make sure that everything
was running smoothly in there which i
think is amazing I only have she's built
an amazing blog and a fantastic
Instagram she just now decided to start
a YouTube channel because even though
her YouTube channel is new she's not new
to the beauty community and she really
has a lot of good insight and good
reviews and I think her YouTube channel
will be really successful I'm also
really amazed at her because she is
currently pregnant with her second child
and now she decides to start a YouTube
channel and this is not to be said in
any sort of bad way at all but a lot of
times I see you know when a woman gets
pregnant I usually kind of scale back
you know what I'm saying and in cases
like no comments are my youtube channel
and I'm just had you go girl I don't
know how you're doing it then that's
amazing like major props to her so she
only has a few videos out right now but
I'm really excited to see what else
she's going to put out for us this year
and I'm just really excited for her and
excited for her YouTube journey so I
hope that you will check out Katie the
next channel that I want to talk about
is one of my first youtube friends and I
believe the very first gal that I ever
did a YouTube collaboration with and
this is alex from a beauty attic next
door oh man I can remember when Alex
messaged me and I want to say it was on
Instagram and she asked and you know she
said that she loved my youtube channel
and asked if we wanted to do a
collaboration operation it was my first
one and I was so nervous about it and I
was so excited that she asked me and I
felt so like honored and privileged and
it was so cool and we've just become
really good friends since then again we
felt each other on snapchat we talked to
each other almost every single day and
she is such a hard worker because not
only does she have beauty attic next
door but she has other channels as well
she has a fitness based channel I know
that she has a fashion based channel
coming up she has more of a lifestyle
channel know how she does it I don't
know how she keeps track of all of them
like major kudos to her and I said I
want to talk about as my friend Robin
from Robins cup of tea Robin choose
correctly up and I think I'm pretty sure
that we met actually via Alex at Beauty
attic next door's it's all of us did a
collab together and I started watching
Robin from then and I just heard videos
just make
you laugh I feel like she has such a
almost a bit dry sense of humor maybe I
would say and there are times where I
illegitimate Lee will snore out loud
watching Robin because she just makes me
laugh so hard and she's just so casual
about it she does a variety of different
video types on her Channel but one that
she did recently I was just dying
laughing her she has a cat and
apparently her cat will take makeup and
it will I go take it out of the room and
she'll like find this makeup scattered
over her house
so she had the idea she started to put
the makeup that her cat would take out
and she put it in a bag and then she
made a video about it and she would pull
out each thing and talk about why she
liked it or what she used it for and I
was the funniest thing ever I laughed
about the entire video and I thought who
thinks to do something like that
that is amazing so Robin Robins cup of
tea I highly recommend her she cracks me
up I love her videos and I'll have her
link down below as well I scaled that I
want to recommend to you is my friend
live from live loved her makeup we
recently did a collab together she was
in part of what spired this video
I love lips channel because I feel like
she comes up with so many good ideas and
so many unique ideas I just talked about
her recently as well when I did my
favorite self tanner video and I also
did what I called the one take challenge
because I want it to be like her because
she filmed all of her videos in one take
which is amazing and incredible I tried
it and it was so hard and I like how is
she so natural and effortless when she
does that we just become really good
friends again we talk snapchat homes
every single day of her video ideas I
love how dedicated she is to her channel
even though she talks a lot about you
know YouTube not being her full-time job
in YouTube being more of a hobby for her
but she still puts so much in she
uploads almost every single day and I
think that's amazing she is still active
on her snapchat I love like when I'm
away from my snapchat for a while I know
that I can come and like kick my feet up
and watch her story because she always
has a lot to say and she's so much fun
to follow over there so Olivia from a
little of her makeup one of my new
favorite favorite channels one of my
really good friends
and I said I want to talk about my
friend Val or Valerie pack she was also
one of my
first YouTube friends and we have just
bombed it in so many different ways
again with all of each other on snapchat
we talk on section a lot and
collaboration videos with each other and
I just love that I love her tutorials
she creates the looks that are so
beautiful yet as someone who's not
really good at makeup I feel like I can
get them and I can follow them and I've
recreated her looks at several times
because the way that she does her
tutorials is easy for me to follow and I
appreciate that so much because
sometimes when you watch these big
makeup artists and they do all these
different techniques and I'm like I
can't can't follow that I can't follow
what you're doing I just really love
bowel tutorials she also does a ton of
fashion videos and I have so much fun
watching her fashion videos so excited
every time she post a video idea because
she has so much different content on her
channel as well as a very very
well-rounded channel and I just love
watching her videos I said I want to
talk about a channel that is a bit newer
to me maybe in the past month or two and
it was actually when I passed on my
channel for channel recommendations a
lot of people recommend it Nicole Renee
Cutler so I'm fairly new to her channel
but I've been having such a good time
watching her videos she is so down to
earth super super relatable I love how
much she loves dogs
a lot of her weekly vlogs that she's
been doing um you know features her dogs
I know she just started her own business
a Bailey's mission I think is what is
called kind of about her dog and she's
put out like stickers I think she's
going to have other merch coming I think
that's super cool I'm so excited about
that that's just amazing to see what
people can do you know from their
YouTube channel and helping me how they
can spin off that and do amazing things
I think that is so very cool I love her
style her she always looks like she
loves living in her big old t-shirt like
somebody's best like grungy makeup lover
channel to me but I've been having a
fantastic time watching her I think
she's that she's a lot of fun and you
should definitely check her out if you
haven't yet I have a slip on my ring
lights of my lighting change it's just
we've had no Sun today no Sun at all
next channel that I wanted to talk about
was Jen from Jen loves reviews jen has
such an interesting unique channel
because she has so many different facets
to her channel she has jen where she has
you know her monthly favorites and her
own boxing's and her
youth but then she also has the make a
minute where every single day she plus a
one-minute video talking about makeup
news I'm you know upcoming releases
things like that they are so
informational and I love watching though
and then she also has what's up and
makeup where it's a longer video it's
kind of like the makeup minute but
longer where she really goes into Inc
deaths about anything new in the makeup
or beauty community which I just think
is super super interesting so I love
watching her videos you always are going
to get something a little bit different
from Jen loves reviews if you love
makeup reviews and just beauty news
I think her channel is super interesting
and I think that you would love it so
next I'm going to talk about another one
that's a newer channel to me and also
recommended from you guys as well and
this is Kendall Alfred I think is how
you say her name but Kendall I love her
channel she was one who when I saw her
recommend it over and over and over in
my comments I went to her Channel I
watched one video and I was like yes I
think that we would get along the love
her personality I loved how much she
loves makeup I love the looks that she
creates I think her makeup tutorials are
so fun and so interesting I just like
watching curves I feel like we're kind
of similar even in like the way that we
speak or the way that we review I think
that we're kind of similar in that
fashion so that might be really more
like watching her as well but I just
think her channel has a lot of good
content on it and even though I'm a new
subscriber to Kendall I still get
excited every time I see her post a
video because I know it's going to be a
fun one so if you are watching Kendall
yet I think that you should another
channel that I just love watching is
Stephanie from Babs Beauty I've actually
talked about Babs beauty in the past on
my channel she's someone who I kind of
just stumbled upon on YouTube it was
like one of my recommended videos and I
remember thinking that she looked like a
Barbie doll and I wanted to look like
her too so I started watching her
tutorials and she was definitely more of
a tutorial based channel when I first
started watching her Oh is almost almost
all of what her uploads were were
tutorial and now she's I love her on
snapchat as well and she talks about how
she is trying to be a more well-rounded
channel and how she's trying to have
more reviews in there and hauls in there
but she is someone who is just a makeup
lover I think that her tutorials are
excellent
I actually in my will I buy it I have a
green top on so will I buy it where I
talked about the Kylie's birthday
collection I'll have it linked down
below I got so many questions on my
makeup look in that video and it was a
hundred percent step by step from one of
her tutorials and I did similar for
Instagram it will be on Instagram I will
give full credit to her because I
literally pulled up her video again and
went step by step by step and I was so
excited when I created it and I think I
did an okay job but we should call it
like her grungy makeup look using the
Jacqueline Hill palette I absolutely
loved it I had to recreate it think that
she's definitely one of like the top
three beauty influencers whose tutorials
I copied the most and makeup lover she's
always buying new makeup I love that she
always tries to find indie brands to
she's always talking about new brands
that I haven't heard of indie brands
that she wants to support her snap hauls
are insane are insane I highly recommend
they follow her and all these girls I'm
talking about on snapchat as well but
they are so much fun to watch so if you
did not follow about this foodie yet
she's a Midwestern girl like me I
believe that she lives in Ohio which is
super fun I definitely recommend that
sweetie right now but I just love
watching is Shay from that girl Shay and
I have to say the other night she
actually tweeted to me well one of my
followers on Twitter Shay asked like for
like video ideas and someone mentioned
to me and she said that she's like she
tweeted back when she loved those videos
of mine and I literally like wanted to
fall off my chair I was like Shay has
seen one of my videos he was just one of
my videos Shay see my videos like that
was crazy
she's amazing I love her personality
she's almost kind of more like she kind
of gives me like those hippy laid-back
vibes like she's like I don't care
attitude I am me and this is who I am
you can accept it or you can just leave
and I just love that about her her
tutorials are always so full of
personality and full of spunk and I love
the tutorials that she creates she
always this looks that I'm like I was
never think to do that but she doesn't
like that's a great idea now I need to
try that one too so I love her look I
think they're some of the more creative
that I see out there and
and I do I just I love her channel she
cracks me up she's not really afraid to
say I would do anything
she's a bride-to-be I'm super excited
for her wedding I can't wait to see what
she looks like as a bride I think it's
going to be amazing if you don't follow
that girl show yet you need to another
channel that I absolutely love is
Jessica Braun or Jam beauty 89 I have
been following Jessica before I had my
youtube channel I love the way that
Jessica reviews in her videos she's very
thorough and she's very in-depth but
she's very fair she always did a lot of
good information she is a teacher as her
career and I feel like that really comes
across on camera she just has such
almost like a calming vibe to her when I
watch her I just know that I'm going to
learn something new and her review
videos I think are amazing she was
someone who actually kind of inspired me
to should I want to say this when I when
I first started my channel and I thought
okay I'm a beauty channel I have to do
makeup tutorials as well and I was never
really comfortable doing tutorials I
like watching her channel I was like you
know she's a beauty Channel - but she is
mostly review based and she just likes
to talk about makeup and she comes up
with good ideas and that's like she kind
of inspired me to be like don't you
don't have to be like everyone else you
don't have to do videos that you don't
necessarily feel comfortable doing as I
grown and you guys have this channel for
over a year now I'm more comfortable and
I've slowly brought in tutorials back
into my channel but she always one that
kind of reminded me of you don't need to
be like everyone else you can do your
own thing and you can just have your
channel be what you love and what you do
want to talk about so like she was the
one that made it click for me and I will
always be appreciative of that and I
remember one day she actually talked
about me on her snapchat and she added
me back on her snapchat and that was
like that was a super overwhelming
moment but Jessica J and beauty 89 you
guys check her out another channel
somewhat new word to me in the past
couple months here but man have I really
grown to love this curl is Stephanie
Nicole and I'm kind of going we're
getting into be bigger and bigger
youtubers here I think at the last time
I checked I'm Stephanie Nicole head form
during 52,000 subscribers a lot of
people talk about Stephanie Nicole
because she's mostly a review based
chair
and she is like that straight shooter
like she's going to tell you what it is
and I appreciate that and I think a lot
of people really appreciate her for that
I get really excited when I see her
reviewing new items because I want to
see what she's going to say she's also
someone who goes into really good
in-depth look she makes me think of
things that she'll mention in a review
and I'm like Clinton you think about
that she has those types of reviews very
thorough very in-depth she doesn't learn
knowledgeable about the makeup that she
talks about and I just I really enjoy
her reviews I enjoy kind of her
no-nonsense attitude and she's just
gonna she's gonna sit down and she's
going to tell you what she thinks and if
you don't like it I'm sorry that's how I
think of Stephanie Nicole so I love her
videos again I'm a little bit newer to
her channel but I would highly highly
recommend her next I'm going to move on
to Amanda NSYNC Amanda was one of the
first beauty channels that I started
watching and it's been a lot of fun to
watch Amanda's journey and kind of watch
where she's gone she's from Tennessee
and I think those last year she was from
Tennessee to LA as she's kind of growing
in the beauty community when I was doing
my video research she was at 989
thousand YouTube subscribers I know she
recently had a million on Instagram as
well so she is someone who I love her
tutorials I also recreate a lot of
Amanda's tutorials
she's mostly a tutorial based channel I
would say her tutorials I think our bomb
I think she is so beautiful and I think
it's been a lot of fun to watch her grow
from Tennessee to LA and she's very open
she just did a video it was like a
chitchat get ready with me what she
talked about her first year in LA and
there's a lot of things that she said
that I was like that's very interesting
I would have known that she's very open
with her subscribers especially on her
snapchat I thought I just loved her
tutorials and I love to recreate them as
well so Amanda and Singh she's been a
favorite of mine for quite some time
next time I move over to a Casey homes I
think she's the first one I'm talking
about that has over a million
subscribers she has one point four
million subscribers
Casey again was one of the first
youtubers that I started watching a lot
of these like bigger gals are probably
probably going to hear me say that a lot
but when I was first getting into
YouTube and I would Google you know
makeup tutorial makeup tutorial smoky
eye whatever these are the gals that
were
up so KC Holmes man I just I just love
her I just I love her I feel like she is
a friend sometimes it can be hard to
figure youtubers to actually feel some
sort of friendship or connection with
and Casey is someone who from the
beginning I felt a friendship was she
was a southern girl as well as if she
was in Georgia she's also a bride-to-be
and so excited like I'm so excited I
can't wait to see what dress she plays I
can't reach do it maybe to let you know
that her hair and I am so excited he's
someone who is so down-to-earth and has
someone who when I watched her two years
ago and I watched her today I feel like
she has not changed she is still the
same person I love her tutorials I love
her reviews I love that she loved to
hall and find makeup as well and she's
just one of my favorite tunes
I just I love Casey Holmes the next time
I'm going to talk about Lester knocks at
Katie from Lester lux I was just talking
about her in the live chat that I did
and I just love her I've been following
her for so long and it's been so
inspiring and motivating to see her
journey because I saw her in her you
know prior YouTube videos where she was
just kind of feeling discouraged and you
know not being sure of where her YouTube
channel was going and where it would
take her and to see where it has taken
her I am so ready for her desease Delta
colors collab I'm so excited about it
it's just been very very encouraging and
motivating like I said to watch her
journey and I just love her she is so
done earth to me she is so like she's
who I want to be I want to be that
person that people can look to for
tutorials reviews makeup news you know
etc etc but then also as a real person
as a friend I thought it was so cool
when Katy desi did their squad tour I
thought it was so cool how they did
their dose of colors release that before
they had the blogger party they did a
giveaway in 200 people won and got to go
to this party and get their swag bags
and see the collab first like they Katy
and Desi I mean does these on my list
next so I'm also talking about desi
Perkins here but they are people to me
who understand the bond that people have
with youtubers
everybody gets it and I totally
understand that and I don't even feel
like maybe every youtuber gets it
honestly but they get it and I
appreciate that so much I love seeing
that I love seeing how much they love
their supporters as well I think it is
so so huge and it just makes them so
relatable I love their vlogs I think
they're amazing so lustre looks
definitely and then next on my list was
going to be desi Perkins who's like
luster Lexus BSS of course their vlogs
are amazing I love their husbands
Stephan and John Hurt son and John yay
there's so much fun I love their dogs
and I talked about it in my life that at
first I wasn't really connecting with
desi because I almost felt like her
YouTube personality was just not like I
don't want to say that I she took
herself too seriously because that
sounds rude and that's not what I'm
trying to say but it was just like I
just couldn't quite vibe with her and
then I kept seeing her on Katy snapchat
so finally I added her because like the
person is really funny and I find the
ads are on snapchat and it is you you
really get the real desi Perkins over
there and I think slowly through time
that has a workshop way into her YouTube
videos as well and I just think it's
super interesting she cracks me up I
love how they don't take themselves too
seriously like yes they can pose like
dominate the camera and do all this fun
stuff but at the same time they also
understand that they're just real people
too and I think that's really cool I
think that's really cool because
sometimes it's really hard to watch some
people snap chest I just take themselves
a little too seriously with those two I
know that you don't get that so let's
relax desi Perkins I'm sure you're
watching them but if you don't you
should I want to talk about Kathleen
lights Kathleen lights is someone who
kind of like what I said with Casey
Holmes is that I feel like she's someone
who has not changed the time that I was
doing that Kathleen has 3.3 million
subscribers and she is someone who I
still think is so real so relatable she
has no problems coming on camera and
talking about her problems or her issues
and opening up to her subscribers make
she's an amazing girl boss for starting
KL polish her own brand of nail polish I
think that's so awesome and amazing
I have snickerdoodle I think it's
fantastic but again it just goes back to
how real and down-to-earth she is and I
think a lot of people really appreciate
that I love her makeup tutorial they
always come out so amazing and fantastic
looking and but they seem so simple and
she doesn't use false lashes a lot which
for me I just enjoyed false lashes but
for those days where you know you're not
feeling very well you don't want to
stick false lashes on
but her tutorials can be so simple to
watch and to recreate but it looks it
looks like so much more I really enjoy
her tutorials I also love that she loves
makeup I think it's interesting with
some of the bigger youtubers as well
obviously I mean I only have you know
20-some thousand subscribers and I get
quite a bit of PR now it's been really
crazy the micro influence or trend is
definitely popping right now which is so
amazing and super super helpful to me
but I can't even imagine being the
youtubers with a million 2 million 4
million subscribers and the amount of
product that they must get but she's
still a true makeup lover and she still
buys makeup and hauls makeup and that's
why I think it's something else that's
really interesting about her because you
don't always see that from those big
youtubers and I'm not trying to say that
that's a bad thing especially if you
just have a lot Y buy even more that can
seem pretty silly which is just a true
makeup lover and she likes to try
different things and then talk about
them and I think that's super cool so
Kathleen like whoever said I want to
talk about Nicole Guerrero no Coldwell
she's definitely the og youtuber I think
she said she's been on YouTube for like
six or eight years which is insane to me
that is such a long time but I enjoy her
videos because she's just she's just
Nicole like she's not going to put on
any game she's not going to have any
frills like she's just Nicole and you
just you just get what you get with her
and I appreciate that so much and she
says a lot I think she's 30 or in her
thirties I want to say that she just
turned 30 but I can't remember and you
know there's times where she's like
people are so mad because I do my
eyebrows dark I'm like it's 2017 were
still on that or people say that she's
look like this and she's like I'm 30
years old and I like looking like this
so thanks bye like I love that part of
her personality she recently did a blog
series where she blogged every single
day for like a month or so and those
blogs really opened up a new level to me
and sold Nicole you got to see a lot
more
of her and a lot more of just her
personality and I thought those blogs
were super super interesting to see if
were arrow 100 action for quite some
time then I just have two more left one
of course being at Jaclyn hill a couple
are Jacqueline tell a lot on my channel
I have two jaclyn hill morphe palette
all my eyes today I've been watching you
guys on health for a very long time
English is a lot of fun to watch she has
a really big personality and I also at
the same time I think that she's very
motivating as well we have kind of
similar backstories and to know kind of
where she was at her life in a certain
point was very similar to where I was at
my life at a similar point and see where
she is now it's definitely you know even
when you're completely down and out and
you feel like you can't get out from
rock-bottom like she's someone who's
kind of showed me that you definitely
can so I think that she is super super
encouraging I love her makeup tutorials
as well I could recreate a lot of her
makeup tutorial and it's just fun she's
kind of like that overzealous a
girlfriend and you know sometimes when I
sit down to watch her videos I just want
to bust out my galata wide and just have
fun with her too because I think that
she really loves her channel that she
loved her subscribers and she just has a
lot of fun making videos and I think it
really comes through on camera so I
really really love a Jaclyn hell been
watching her for a very very long time
and then I'm going to end it with the
very first Beauty youtubers that I ever
watched that opened up my world so that
there even was such a thing as being a
beauty youtuber and that of course is
Carli bybel she has over 5.5 million
YouTube subscribers I think she is yet
on my list she has the most subscribers
at over five and a half million which is
insane but I remember actually getting
ready for my wedding I was doing a
wedding makeup trial and the gal
mentioned a technique that she wanted to
use from Carli bybel and I said who is
that and she said well she does makeup
on YouTube I said come come again who
why is she doing makeup on YouTube
doesn't what do you mean I didn't even
watch YouTube and this was you know for
yeah four years ago and so she
recommended that I watch her and I went
home and I googled YouTube
Bible and she came out cnidocytes whoa I
want to do that too like one of the
first thoughts I have been watching
Carly's videos because I just that had
been binge watched all night I can
remember watching video after video
after video I just thought I want to do
that too that looks like so much fun
like it looked like she was having an
absolute blast in her videos I was
learning things because I was never I
mean I'm still not very good at makeup
but I've never been very well and doing
makeup and creating makeup looks and I
was watching her tutorials I was making
lists of things that she was
recommending to buy and she was really
someone who watching her videos seem
hard label she was and just how much fun
she was having doing it
I did not realize even when I started my
youtube channel when I first sat down to
fill my first video I didn't know that
that was these people's jobs it was well
into my youtube channels when Carly made
a comment about a meet-and-greet and I
thought a meet and greet with who and I
thought it was at a mall and I was like
why are people going to meet this
Colonel who does makeup on YouTube I
still didn't get it
even after I started my youtube channel
I did not get it and I still didn't even
get after that it took me even longer to
figure out that people have full-time
jobs on YouTube like that's their angle
I still don't get that when I have it
YouTube channel when I ever started it I
will always remember being pulled to
watch her on YouTube and just seeing her
and seeing her passion for making her
videos and thinking I want to do that
too and I did so I got a throwback to
the very first ever Beauty influencer
that I watched on YouTube with Carli
bybel he's super inspiring she's always
out there trying to do good which i
think is super cool a lot of her
giveaways to enter you have to do like a
good deed and film it you have to plant
a tree and don't let those are her give
away to think that's so cool she's very
into giving back she has a scholarship I
have her bracelets on she created these
bracelets and the proceeds went to her
scholarship charity fund
I bought the bracelets as well love oh
yeah I'm a huge supporter of Carly she
is definitely one who motivates me a ton
I'm sure that you're probably one of the
5.5 million people that follow her but
in case you aren't you should I guess
what that is going to do it afford my
favorite YouTube channels my favorite
youtubers those that I watch on YouTube
I'm not sure what I'm going to call this
video yet but I hope that you guys
enjoyed it I hope it give you a little
insight on me maybe some of my YouTube
friends and maybe some of the bigger
YouTube channels that I love to watch
and I can't miss a video from so let me
know in the comments down below who I
mentioned that you absolutely love and
watch or leave me any suggestions
because like I mentioned with some of
these gals I got their names because of
you I think YouTube is definitely a lot
of word-of-mouth now so I would
appreciate any more suggestions that you
guys might have I hope that you guys did
enjoyed this video and if you did make
sure to give it a thumbs up I hope that
you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I'll teach you guys
real soon in my next one bye
