today's video I'm really excited for
because I'm going to be unboxing my
beauty lish lucky bag for 2018 I talked
about this in the past but I buy a video
and I said that I was interested in
picking me up and I was able to get it
which I was really excited about and if
finally arrived it actually came late
last night but I really wanted to do it
the bomb boxing on camera so it's been
really really hard not to peek at this
so if you're interested in seeing what I
got in my beauty little lucky bag why
don't I go ahead and get started
alrighty so of course I ordered this off
of Beauty lish um it was $75 I did like
the smaller version instead of like the
XL it was $75 and then with the shipping
I think the total cost was eighty two
dollars all of the products inside I
have no idea what did they are today I
was gonna take a nail photo prior to
starting this video and I guess I
thought that you've got an actual bag
because it's called the lucky bag so I
kind of dug in here and I was like okay
I'll just take this bag out but you
don't get a bag it's just all of the
products are wrapped in this piece of
tissue paper so I like kind of peaked I
did not see anything though but I
thought you would get a bag why is it
called the lucky bag if you don't get it
back
anyone else confused about that so I
don't know the best way I'm gonna do
this now because I thought I was gonna
be like reaching into a bag and pulling
stuff out but um okay this is my first
time getting the Beauty lish a lucky bag
I didn't even know very much about it
last year until I started seeing
people's unboxings and it sells out
right away so I was like wait what is
that I don't want that so I am excited
to see what is in here so let me see I'm
just going to kind of open it like this
but then try to like matte look I'm not
person that likes to be surprised as
anybody else that way if you have like
subscription bags do you like to be
surprised by what's inside because I do
okay so first up ooh this is from
Natasha de Nona it is called a body glow
Duke and I familiar with the by niccolÃ²
it's in the shade light it says okay so
here is what that one looks like all it
says is a shake before use so let me
lift this up and see what it's all about
because I don't feel like I am familiar
with this so it says that the body glow
is
fifty-five dollars it says it has a
light fresh and fluid consistency that
is easy to apply all over the body for a
radiant glow its formula is quick drying
and non sticky and resistant to water
and sweat making it suitable for any
occasion
okay so honestly I am not sure how often
I would use the body glow I mean I
definitely want to try it out and see
what it's all about maybe if it's
similar to like the what's it called
it's right up there if it's similar to
the Vita Liberata body blur I bet I
would really like it but if it's just
gonna give a glow I don't reach for
those types of products at times but
I'll have to give that one a try and see
what I think but I was cool to get
something from Natasha Genoa
next up in here I do see a product from
click this is from at Jeffers star
cosmetics it is a velour liquid lipstick
and the shade is in Sagittarius I'm
going to go ahead and open it and see
yeah so it looks like a liquid lipstick
here the shade Sagittarius I'm not going
to open this one I actually don't have
anything from jeffree star cosmetics I
haven't made a purchase from him so I'm
probably just going to go ahead and pass
this one over it doesn't look like it
would be like my type of shade anyways
so I don't think I'm going to open that
one I think I could pass it along to
someone but I can go ahead and see here
my voice sounds terrible don't mind that
but I can go ahead and see here how much
this one costs alright so it looks like
the evil or Lippitt lipsticks from a
jeffree star are $18 so that is that one
and then next up here I see oh this is
from Pfizer that's exciting
okay let's see this bubble wrapped it
really well okay so this is a from busy
art I think it is actually how you say
it and it is the theory palette I see am
i familiar with that one so this is what
the palette looks like and then inside
ooh that's pretty
okay so it's like a little mini palette
here and then you have the six different
shades inside those look super cute I
did have a subscriber recently send me
the busy art petite Pro palette I think
is what it was called
looks really similar in packaging to
that one but I haven't tried
yet so now I'm excited to have another
one that one looks like I would get a
lot of use out of those shades looks
like they have actually quite a few of
the theory palettes the one that I got
is in nuance so the nuance is of $45 for
this little palette
I know busy art is Coy's crisi so $45
for that palette that doesn't be pretty
excited actually that's a pretty fun
okay so next up I see a brush this is a
Wayne Goss number 10 brush I've never
tried when God's brushes but I do hear
the things about them this looks like it
could be maybe like a tapered highlight
brush perhaps maybe is what that would
be good for it doesn't only ten is
actually a cheek brush it's $38 for this
brush alone ooh that does that's is very
pricey I don't know I think I would
still use it as a highlight brush also
in here let's see what is next next is
it was a sheet mask this is from I'm not
gonna be able to print out so
apprehending but this is a first care
activating mask I'm sure exactly here's
what it looks like I'm not sure exactly
what like I can't find where it says if
it's like is it for hydrating is it for
acne you know that kind of thing so it
says is $60 for five sheets so not sixty
dollars for one because I saw that for a
second I was like what it says it's
Korea's number one serum for the past 20
years is now offered in a sheet mask
that delivers optimum skin that texture
and instant moisture so got a new sheet
mask to try and then we've got one more
item in here it is double wrapped again
pretty heavily so let me see if I can
get this opening so this is from a Smith
and cult it says in Stockholm Syndrome
I'm honestly not sure what it is yet let
me see if I can open it is it a perfume
I do not know what this is well let me
look it up it is not a perfume it is a
nail polish okay so clearly I took the
top off incorrectly then I'm gonna have
to play Rob this one but this is
definitely the fanciest
nail polish that I have ever tried in my
life or ever seen in my life again it's
called a Stockholm
from Smith and cold I am not familiar
with them if you are please do let me
know let me know what you think of them
so these are $18 and it says nail your
next manicure with a smooth coverage and
ultra shiny finish of this eight free
nail polish and says it comes in 26
different shades and this one is in
elephant gray which I do love me some
gray so I will probably give this one a
try $18 brown nail polish that is no
joke but after that that's going to do
it for my beauty lish lucky bag unboxing
so let me grab out all the products and
go through them again real quickly okay
so I got six different items in here and
I believe it adds up to 186 dollars and
again what the shipping cost I paid 80 -
so this is nataschab de Nona body glow
I'm gonna read a couple reviews on it
and see what I think if anyone's try
that let me know I just I'm not sure if
I want to use it or if I would want to
pass it along because I just don't wear
this type of stuff a ton so that one I'm
not so sure about
again the Jeffrey star value eye liquid
lipstick for $18 I personally do not
support so I will not be keeping this
one but I have some friends who do so I
can pass this along to them and I think
I could make someone pretty happy with
getting a new lipstick so again that's
kind of like mmm for me probably the
thing that I'm most excited about is
this eyeshadow palette from a busy art
the one in theory I really liked the
shades in here and I've been wanting to
try more from this brand for sure so
this one does have me pretty excited
again I've lived this one was $45 so I'm
happy about that we also have the Wayne
Goss brush and number 10 again honestly
I'm not even sure if I will keep the
brush I have plenty of highlighting
brushes and brushes that I love and it's
$38 so that's pretty pricey um I don't
know I also I'm not sure how much I
really like love Wayne Goss I tried to
watch some of his videos for awhile and
I just feel like he really likes to put
a lot of people down so I don't know I
don't know if I'll keep this one let me
know what you guys think though about
the wind gusts brushes I would love to
know
um the sheet masks I do get pretty
excited over sheet masks but I've been
trying more sheet masks lately like
actual k-beauty she asked
and I feel like for whatever reason they
are not working well with my skin I had
a really bad reaction to one I bought a
month ago or so and so I don't know I
feel like every time I try a k-beauty
sheet mask I have some sort of adverse
effect to my face so I'm a little
worried I'm not a hundred percent I will
try this one I think this one is like 12
dollars on its own or something like
that or it comes in the pack of 60 but
yeah I'm not so sure about that
and then for the nail polish which is 18
dollars I mean this is a really like
beautiful bottle of nail polish and I do
like the color again I'm just not sure
if I will keep it for myself or not I do
really like nail polishes but I have a
huge collection because I do like to
paint my own nails but again I'm just
I'm not sure if I will get use out of
this so basically everything that came
in the lucky bag I know for sure I'm
only gonna use one of the items which is
$45 the bag was 75 so mm I don't really
know what I think about this one I felt
like when I was watching the unboxings
the last year people were getting like I
felt like stuff that was kind of new and
now maybe and I don't know some
different brands and things like that
but I don't know I think I'm just
feeling a little bit too let down by
this lucky bag did anybody else get it -
do you have the same thoughts as me what
products did you get I think there's
different products in each bag so I hope
some of you guys got some better items
are not necessarily better items but
items that are better for you I mean
that's always the risk that you run when
you do something like this or really any
makeup subscription bag you don't know
for sure what it is that you're gonna
get inside so it is a risk you run but
darn that $75 risk it did not work out
for me I felt like I heard such good
things last year but I just don't know
how much um use something to get out of
this so I'm gonna have to go ahead and
save the beauty little lucky bag for me
personally was not so great which is the
bummer but yeah after that that is going
to do it for my unboxing of the 2018
Beauty lish lucky bag
I guess the light is everything for this
video I hope that you still enjoyed
seeing and unboxing on my channel I
don't do unboxings a ton but I got so
much feedback when I did mention this
interval I write video and a lot of
people
that they really did want to see me do
the unboxing on camera I wish I could
have been a little bit more excited for
the products that I got but that's okay
I know that I'll still have fun playing
with this iron shadow pellet and
hopefully some of my friends will be
happy if I pass along some of these
items to them but do you let me know if
you guys at the bank if you have the
same feelings I did or if you just got
like banging I would love to know but
unfortunately this was a bit of a Miss
for me so I do not think I would go for
the beauty little of you back next year
based off of this unfortunately but if
you guys did enjoy this video and you're
like to seeing the unboxing I hope that
you'll give it a thumbs up I hope that
you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I will catch you guys
in at tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
