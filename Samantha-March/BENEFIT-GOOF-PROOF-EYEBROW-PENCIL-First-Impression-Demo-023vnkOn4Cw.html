today's video I'm going to be doing a
quick little first impression and demo
of the new goof proof brow pencil from
benefit this is the packaging that I got
mine in and then I have like a sample
size of the new goof proof brow pencil
so I wanted to do just a demonstration
so we can see how it works and if it
works and then kind of a first
impression review this is a new product
from benefit I got a sample of it
because at Alta got an email one day
saying with any purchase you would get a
sample of the goof proof pencil so I was
like okay so i put in an order and got
the sample just very excited about then
I wasn't sure if you guys would want to
see a video but I asked my snapchat fan
and people seem to be into it so I
thought why not let's do it I have not
tried this yet so this will be total
first impressions I'm actually a little
bit nervous to do this video because I
don't do my eyebrows a whole lot I do
have the NYX micro brow pencil and I
have some like tinted brow gel but I'm
not very good at browse yet but this is
supposed to be a goof proof so we'll see
how it goes I've also been hearing it's
good for people that have like fuller
eyebrows but just have like sparse
sections which is me like I don't need
to fully draw on a full eyebrow type of
thing and that's what I'm hearing that
this pencil is good for so we'll give it
a trial about the pencil this retails
for twenty-four dollars this like I
mentioned is a sample size the full size
is a little bit larger also the sample
size does not come with the spoolie at
the end but the regular product will
have the product on one end and then the
spoolie on another end so it retails for
twenty-four dollars it comes in six
different shades I got the shade too
they have very limited shades that we
can pick from at aalto so I tried to I
really don't know if this is going to
work but they have shades one through
six and the full collection of the new
benefit browse will be on sale on jun
24th they have six products launching I
believe it is three of them are products
that have already been released but
they're being like repackaged and stuff
and then there is three new products and
one of them is the goof proof pencil so
this is what the inside of the product
looks like you can see it's kind of like
this diamond teardrop shape and its
really pointy on one end and then also
kind of flat my only concern with it I
think would be if you use it so much you
might kind of lose that shape because I
here like this shape is good for
eyebrows but i do get just a little
worried if you use it several times you
might kind of lose that shape but i
don't i don't know we will see i feel
like the new anastasia brow wiz is what
are they called like brow definers i
feel like they have the same like kind
of concept and I heard like people
complaining about losing the shape after
a while and then like I mentioned on the
full size that would also come with a
spoolie on the end I'm just going to
grab my next micro brow pencil and use
that slowly on there so we can get the
full effect of it since this is just a
little sample guy but the full
collection is launching I'm june
twenty-fourth so i will leave all the
links below to benefit so looking at the
packaging that it came in when it talks
about this goof proof pencil it says
it's supposed to be a super easy brow
filling and shaping pencil fast full and
natural looking brows magically appear
thanks to the glide on formula soft
color and goof proof tip so it says with
the custom teardrop tip you're supposed
to have the wide base to fill in the
brows and the pointed tip that defines
the brow supposed to be 12 hours
waterproof and formula adheres to the
hair not to the skin five percent said
it was easy to fill in shape the brows
ninety-four percent that it gives
beautiful brows on the first try on sale
the 24th okay all right I think that's
all we need to know about the pencil so
now let's give it a try the pointed edge
and come on the bottom of my brow first
and just make short little lines here
okay and then I'm going to take the
pencil and draw quick little strokes up
to mimic the hairs at the front of the
brow I matter with my spoolie and it's
kind of distribute the product around
and I'm going to brush my hair's down so
I can see where to fill in on the top of
the brow I'm going to take the pointed
edge again and just do those shorts
little lines
and fill in the tail just a little bit
I'm going to spoil you through again so
you don't need much pressure when you're
doing this it seems to be a pretty darn
pigmented next one I really have to like
press down in order to get anything out
and I notice what this one you really
don't need that so now I'm going to take
like the wider base and just kind of
look throughout the brow to cover any
sparse areas so the color doesn't seem
to be too bad like not knowing what
color would be mine so okay there's one
brow compared to the other brow can you
guys tell a difference like I said like
my eyebrows are pretty full anyway so
sometimes it's hard for me to like
notice but i guess i can definitely tell
that this one is you know more filled in
like I said I just need it like a light
hand it was it came out pretty darn
pigmented just using the spoolie to kind
of distribute the product around I think
it looks okay so I'm gonna try the other
brow
and then there is the other brow filled
in hopefully they look even so there we
go alright guys so here are my brows
using the benefit goof proof brow pencil
what do you guys think can you notice a
difference sometimes it's hard for me
because my brows are already so fault
like I get a little bit nervous to use
brow pencils because I don't want to go
overboard and end up just like looking
crazy so I tend to go in with the
lighter hand and one thing that I
noticed right away is that this is very
very pigmented so you don't need a heavy
hand with my next one I kinda do need to
put more pressure on it to get the
product actually out and onto my eyebrow
but with this 1i could still use a light
hand but so far I think it worked pretty
good it was easy to use easy to work
with I like that the color I wasn't sure
about at first I thought maybe it was
looking a little bit too dark but again
this is too there's only one more
lighter shade but looking on it a little
bit further I just meant looked in the
mirror I do think the color is okay
maybe just a touch dark but I think it
will work for me so again my color is in
too if that you want some sort of
reference if you're thinking about
getting the pencil for yourself but
again first impressions very pigmented
easy to use I'm a beginner when it comes
to eyebrows I'm like beginner when it
comes to eyebrows and so far like
pomades and things like that still
freaked me out a little bit so for this
this does not really intimidate me so
that's good so if you're trying to get
into the eyebrow gram maybe pick this up
seems like it could be good for you I'm
hearing and seeing and the feedback that
I'm getting is that this is better for
people who are like me that have like a
good shape of an eyebrow and quite a bit
of Iroh hair and you just need a little
help filling it in this seems to be
really good for that some people are
saying it's not the best for actually
like drawing on an eyebrow so if you
need that maybe this might not be the
best for you but if you're kind of like
a little bit lazy with your eyebrows
like me this could be a good option for
you again the full size is going to be
$24 it's going to be on sale on june
twenty-fourth probably do a full review
