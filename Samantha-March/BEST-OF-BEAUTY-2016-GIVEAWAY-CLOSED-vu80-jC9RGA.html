so excited for today's video because i'm
bringing you a new giveaway and i have
to still pumped
this one and I hope that you guys get
excited forward to so basically what I'm
doing with this giveaway is I have been
working really hard on my best of beauty
2016 video so typically around this time
of the year that is when you start
seeing best of videos coming out and for
us Beauty vloggers its best of beauty
for the entire year where we take all of
our favorite beauty products and put
them into one video it's just one big
giant favorites video been working for
about the past month on my list and my
products and getting everything in
together and putting my list together
and I've been having a lot of fun doing
it because this time last year I was
actually still a book channel that's how
I started on YouTube was as a book
channel because I'm also an author in a
book blogger and it wasn't until the
summer that I changed over to a beauty
channel so I wasn't able to do best of
beauty last year so I've been so excited
to do it this year and as I was putting
my list together I thought wouldn't this
be a fun giveaway so I am taking 16 of
my favorite products from 2016 and
giving them to you guys so I went
through my list and I went through some
of my favorites this isn't like my top
top 16 I mean there's no way I'd be able
to like rank anything in order but these
are some of just my favorite products
that you will be seeing in my upcoming
best of beauty 2016 video so I've 16
products and I'm going to be giving them
away to you guys and I'm so excited and
I hope you guys like this idea and I
hope that you like the prizes so I'm
going to go ahead I'll go over the
prizes first and then at the end i will
share how to enter and the rules and all
that good stuff but when we go ahead and
jump into the prices I'm not going in
any certain order I'm just gonna go with
how I pick things up and I first picked
up a couple of lippies you guys know
that I love lipstick what are you like
holding them all here you guys can
probably tell them i love nudes because
i'm giving away three nude libya's and
these were all some of my favorites so
the first one is a color jolt from
maybelline this is their color jolt
intense lip pain in stripped down one of
my favorite favorite colors and I was so
excited when I got this because these
are so so good they're very intense but
they're very long-lasting they're not
uncomfortable like a liquid lipstick be
there just so good and then I have two
from NYX I just love Nick slippy
so much so I got one of the soft matte
lip creams in Abu Dhabi just a really
great nude brown color this is one of
dizzy Perkins favorites as well she made
me buy it and I loved it so I wanted to
include that in the giveaway and then i
also have a one of the lingerie liquid
lipsticks from NYX I'm actually wearing
one on my lips right now I'm wearing the
one in ruffled trim and I got this one
in bedtime flirt which is another one
that i own and it's a really great nude
pink I like the lingerie lippies from
NYX so I wanted to include that in there
so nude lippies were obviously just
totally my thing so there are three that
you will be winning and then some of my
favorite lashes that i bought in 2016
has been able to get my hands on them
are the grand glamour lashes from i lure
in Vegas nay I love these lashes so much
they are so full and volume ists and
glamorous and I just absolutely love
these they sell out really fast like
sometimes they're not in stock all the
time because everybody loves them too so
whenever I see them in stock i pick up
an extra pair for me as well but these
will be in the giveaway so one of my
favorite eye liners in 2016 is the
Maybelline master precise a liquid
eyeliner this is what it looks like I
have gone through two of them and I'm on
my third one now it's one that I just
repurchase over and over I really really
like this liquid eyeliner I think it's
fantastic so I'm including that in the
giveaway as well I thought you guys
would need some new makeup sponges
because makeup sponges are something
that we go through quickly and we're
constantly needing to replace and keep
up with so I thought why not include two
of my favorite makeup sponges in here so
the first one that i'm giving away is
from Real Techniques and it is the
miracle diamond sponge I'm so excited I
love this I have a full video talking
about the diamond sponge using the
diamond sponge and it quickly became one
of my absolute favorites it's so big and
just has so many different sides and
angles to it that you can get your
entire face on without feeling like
you're using a dirty Beauty Blender I
absolutely love it and when I bought
this one I picked up another one for
myself because I know that I'm already
gonna need another one and then I also
wanted to get you guys a beauty blender
because I was finally able to try the
Beauty Blender in 2016 I picked up the
Black Beauty Blender in the Sephora VIP
say
l and i love it it quickly replaced the
nude as my favorite Beauty Blender which
I don't know it was kind of maybe unfair
to say because it was the only Beauty
Blender that I tried but I love love
love the black one so much so you'll be
getting two of my favorite makeup
sponges in this giveaway so I have some
favorite skincare to include in here as
well I picked up this a little holiday
trio from first day beauty it comes with
the facial radiance pads which are bomb
I have repurchased some countless times
they're amazing it also comes with the
face cleanser which is awesome and then
the ultra Repair lip therapy which I
actually haven't tried yet so you guys
have to let me know what that is but
first day beauty became one of my
favorite favorite skincare brands in
2016 I've loved everything that I've
tried out for them there hasn't been
anything that I've tried that I haven't
loved I think it's fantastic so when I
saw this little trio guy I thought what
better way I tried out first aid beauty
by buying a little set like this so I
thought I'd give it to you in case maybe
you haven't tried for say beauty yet or
maybe you love them just as much as I do
and need to stock up on a few things and
then also in skincare this is a new one
for me you knew for sure I was gonna put
it in my best of beauty video it was
just in my like November favorites I
think and actually this company was kind
enough to send me these which I just
think so much because it's so expensive
putting together these giveaways and
having to buy everything but they are
sheet masks from SNP and you're getting
I think there's eight in here for yeah
you're getting eight sheet masks from
SMP I'm so excited for you guys because
this is so bomb so when SMP said that
they would send over a giveaway package
I was like that's so cool they're going
to send like a face mask or two and they
sent eight and I was like whoa that is
amazing so I just think as if you so
much for sending this along they will be
linked in the description box below you
can get these at Ulta and I just think
they are so fabulous so each one is like
a different animal so when you put on
the mask it actually kind of looks like
that animal each one does a different
things so like the tiger is to boost
I'll skin the otter is 24 like moisture
the rabbit is a frightening face mask
etc etc i have used so many of these and
i absolutely love them i'm so excited
that they're available at Ulta really
accessible
so I'm just I'm so grateful that they
sent these along so you guys will be
getting eight of the sheet masks that is
no joke okay then moving along actually
have another set of lashes I totally
forgot about these these are just some
ardell wispies they're my favorite
lashes that have been since like the
beginning of time when I first started
wearing eyelashes I've always gone with
the ardell with spades know I've given
away our dell wispies a lot in the past
it's because of my favorite I want
everybody but have a pair so you'll also
get some ardell lashes along with the i
adore lashes I love lashes obviously and
then I have a couple things from
Smashbox Smashbox was really like one of
my favorite brands of 2016 it really was
I tried a lot of different products from
them and I really enjoyed nearly
everything that I tried so I have some
items to include from Smashbox in here
and one is there blush and highlight
trio now this one I do want to make you
aware that the packaging is wrong I
don't know what I did I got three of
them going for myself and then I like
mixed up the packaging somehow so the
one that you'll be getting is in Malibu
berry but the packaging says Culver City
cross that's not correct so you're
getting the Malibu berry and it has to
blush shades in a highlight shade I
think these are beautiful fun in an
upcoming makeup tutorial that you'll see
you soon I just think they are great and
now know if people talk about them so I
love these so you'll be getting one as
well and I also have this set Smashbox
came up with like these lighted up sets
for the holiday season but I thought
this one was so cool because it comes
with mascara and like a primer set so i
thought this that was really cool
because it features like the x-rated
mascara so i don't know if you can see
the packaging is kind of like hard to
show it but you get like the full-size
x-rayed it and then like more of a
deluxe size and it also comes with their
photo finish lash primer so i just
thought that was really fun the x-rated
mascara was one of my favorites from
2016 so you get a little set here as
well so i did have to include some more
Lupe's in here lipsticks are just my
absolute favorite and this is a newer
favorite to me as well but seriously
when I tried it I was like these liquid
lipsticks are amazing so I decided to
get one of the hooter beauty lip contour
sets I recently did a snapchat or
scratching on these and just raved about
them I thought they're amazing so this
is the same one
I mentioned in my video right right yes
it has trendsetter and bombshell inside
so you get minis of the trendsetter and
bombshell liquid lipstick and then you
get a full-size trendsetter lip liner I
love it I video link down below in case
you'd want to see my review and the
swatches of them but I just fell in love
with these liquid lipsticks I really
wanted to get this set and I saw that
now this is sold out at sephora to and
none of the other sets are back and work
where did they go I hope that they're
coming back but you'll get to try out
some who to beauty in the giveaway as
well so I have a couple of iron shadow
palettes in here also one of my absolute
favorites of the year was the BH
Cosmetics and carli bybel I shadow
palette it comes with 10 different
eyeshadows and for highlighters and I
just loved this palette it was such a
standout for me I use it all the time I
travel with it it has a mirror in it the
shades are beautiful a lots of like gold
shimmers and mob shades and the
highlights are so pretty and I just I
loved it so much I found myself reaching
for it all the time and traveling with
it and just really was one of my
favorites so I picked this one up for
you guys as well and then the other eye
shadow palette oh my gosh I fell in love
with this one this was one that when I
saw it I knew that I wanted it and I got
it and I was like that was a great
decision because I just absolutely fell
in love with it and it's from Tarte
cosmetics and it's be styled by her
roush palette oh it comes with six
different eyeshadows and then also a
really nice big blush it has a mirror
it's such a nice palette I reached for
this so often it's super easy to travel
with because it is on the smaller side
but it has the big mirror in it I used
it when I was a bridesmaid in a wedding
like this is just one of my favorite
palettes I love that has the blush in
there as well and I feel like I've just
raved about this so much so I was like I
have to include this in the giveaway and
then the last item that I picked up is
from Becca cosmetics and Jaclyn hill and
it is one of the split pans so this is
the one that has amaretto blush and then
Prosecco pop as the highlight I have
Prosecco pop on my cheeks or right now I
absolutely loved the champagne glow face
palette that Jacqueline teamed up with
Becca cosmetics for I fell in love with
it and these two shades were really like
the standout shades to me I fell
in love with amaretto and I fell in love
with Prosecco pop and I reach for them
so often I love them so when I saw the
split plan I was like that's a way to
take like my two absolute favorites from
that palette and put it into one little
guy for you guys and put it into my
giveaway so I'm really excited for
someone to win this because those two
shades in particular just like blew me
away I actually might even like Prosecco
pop more than champagne pop and that's
saying a lot because I love champagne
pop so much but pro psychopath is just
such a beautiful gold or when you mix
them together it's oh my gosh it is so
good so that is my 16th right I hope my
16th and final I know that you'll be
