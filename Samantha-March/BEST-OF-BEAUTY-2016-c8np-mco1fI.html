I'm really excited for today's video
because it is going to be my best of
beauty 2016 video super super stoked to
do this video because it's gonna be my
first best video that I'm doing this
time last year I was actually still a
book channel that's how I got onto
YouTube was as a book channel cuz I'm
also a book blogger and published author
so I started a book channel and then
somehow I've morphed into this beauty
channel and I relaunched in May as
solely a beauty channel you know I do so
mention my books and such on here since
that is my career but I changed from
like having a beauty video scattered in
here and there throughout the book
channel to just solely focusing on
beauty and so that means that this is my
first year that I get to do the best of
beauty and I'm really really excited for
it if you guys don't know I do actually
have a best of beauty 2016 giveaway
happening right now so I chose a 16 of
my favorite products from throughout the
year and then I'm giving them away
I'll have that linked in the description
box below make sure to check it out cuz
you will want to win some of my personal
favorites so I'm like super nervous to
do this video because I just feel like I
have forgotten so many things I have
looked at this list I've been working on
this list since like mid-november I've
been working on it I've been trying to
narrow down everything but then I also
didn't want to make this a super super
long video because I know I have a lot
of long videos so then I tried to cut
down the list and then I wasn't sure if
I was cutting out the right Pro my gosh
it just it's been kind of crazy but I
really do want to get this video filmed
and out there especially because I have
the corresponding giveaway with it but
we're just gonna go ahead jump into it I
tried to pick like my top you know I
would say like 2 to 3 but I know some
categories have a little bit more but I
try to pick my favorite favorite
favorite from each of the categories so
I'm really excited to bring you my
favorite products from throughout the
year of 2016
welcome to 2017 everybody can you
believe it we have made it to another
year what are your new year's
resolutions
let me know in the comments down below I
can't wait to hear them I can't wait to
see what this year brings I have no idea
what's gonna happen in 2017 but I am
looking forward to it
but without further ado why don't I go
ahead and jump into my favorite products
ok so first up I'm gonna talk about a
foundation now I'm not gonna do
like every single category probably
because some I just don't feel like I
was like super passionate about any set
of products like face primers is one of
them I'm not I'm not like super crazy
about any sort of primer so I'm not
gonna include those types in here so you
might say like some categories that
other people do that I'm not doing etc
but this is our videos we could make
them our own way instead but our own
favorite products but I'm going to start
off with foundation so this one I don't
know if it was necessarily a 2016
favorite because I think I might've
bought it in 2015 but I really can't
quite remember but this is the True
Match Lumi foundation from L'Oreal I
love this foundation it was one of like
my first like real foundation purchases
that was a recommendation of Jacqueline
Hill and I was just super excited before
I got on YouTube I honestly really
didn't wear that much makeup I wasn't
really a foundation to have a person so
this foundation I feel like will always
kind of have a special place to me
because it was like one of my first
purchases that I was like oh I'm buying
real foundation how do you put it on you
know it's I have a thing but yeah the
True Match Lumi it just gives your skin
such a healthy glow it's one of my
absolute favorites another one from
L'Oreal that actually turned into a
favorite in 2016 that I really wasn't
expecting it co but it's the L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow foundation L'Oreal
foundations seem to get a ton of hype
around YouTube I don't know what it is
but they do something right because
their foundations get seriously
seriously hyped up this was one that was
getting so much hype and finally I
bought into it and I was like hey see
what the hype was about I really like
this one because it does give you a glow
like The True Match Lumi does but it's
also more full coverage and some days
you just need that more full coverage
look super super long lasting I wore
this a lot in the summer it's full
coverage but doesn't feel like cake face
on your face I wore this a lot in the
summer and I'm still wearing it a lot
now so one of my favorites and then my
last favorite foundation from the year
has to has to be of course the Clinique
beyond perfecting a foundation and
concealer oh man this turned into one of
my absolute favorite foundations I reach
for it all the time it's full coverage
it's long-lasting it's comfortable I
love it I think it's an amazing
foundation and it's only $27 for this
big ol bottle and that's
really not bad for a high-end foundation
I am think $27 was a bad price this is
one that I reach for a lot and I feel
like I'm gonna have to start running low
at some point and I would have to pick
me up another one
so for concealers I have one drugstore
and one high-end the drugstore is my
maybelline fitme concealer again Natura
this wasn't necessarily a favorite that
came out in 2016 because I think I
bought it before then but it definitely
has been a favorite all throughout the
year ever since I bought it this is
probably my third or fourth concealer
the Maybelline fit me has like a cult
following everybody loves it I love it
maybe not everybody loves it because not
everybody loves everything but you know
what I mean I love it I think it's
fantastic I go through these like crazy
and then high-end you guys have any idea
what high-end concealer could have been
my favorite in 2016 is the Tarte shaped
cape of course it is who didn't love the
tersh ape tape when it came out because
everybody went bananas over this
concealer like my goodness you would
have thought this concealer I was
solving all of our problems because
everybody went crazy for it ran out of
stock it's been restocked and it was
like the most joyous occasion in the
world like oh my goodness
heart-shaped tape if you don't have it
yet you go check it out it's full
coverage it's amazing it's just you just
got to have it so I have some like
setting powders that I want to talk
about this might seem really weird I
technically I guess I have two for each
category two for under the eyes and two
for all over the face so for all over
the face I fell in love with the
Maybelline better skin skin transforming
powder I fell hard for this foundation
this is what the inside looks like it
comes with this own little sponge that
would be the product that I just put my
finger in comes with its own sponge
which is massively dirty the powder and
then a big mirror I take this with me
everywhere I travel with it I've used
the sponge normally I don't use sponges
that comment products I've used that it
makes your face look so airbrushed and
flawless I love this sometimes I just
wear it by itself sometimes I wear it
over like a BB cream or tinted
moisturizer it's amazing definitely
check that one out and then this one
shouldn't be a shock either it was
mentioned in my ride-or-die tag it is
the pure cosmetics for in one mineral
powder yeah and I have another one in my
organizer behind me I love this stuff
I have been wearing this I mean this is
one that wasn't a favorite that I found
in 2016 because I'm pretty sure I've
been wearing this since my college days
and that was definitely not in 2016 or
2015 or 2014 let's just stop this has
been a favorite for so many years again
I can wear by itself over a BB cream
sometimes to set foundation even I just
I'm obsessed with this powder at 2:00
for the under eyes that I want to talk
about this one is from a wet and wild it
is a part of their mega glow contouring
palette so it has two sides
- the dulce de leche has the two sides
this is the setting powder and then this
is your contour powder I love both of
them I highly recommend this it's super
affordable I think I just mentioned it
in my last favorites video because I
actually broke my original one that I
had and I went right out and bought me a
new one because I love this gorgeous
stunning powder but it's also super
brightening on the other eye on the
under eyes which I love which brings me
to my next product which is the laura
mercier secret brightening powder again
I love bright under eyes it's just what
I love I just think it makes you look
more awake and fresh and can just like
immediately change up your look everyone
was raving about the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and I was like well
heck I'm gonna try out the brightening
powder because that's the look that I go
for and it's amazing I use it all the
time you guys have probably seen it in
so many of my tutorials it's bomb I've
loved it and then moving on to contour I
have to cream and to powder so a for
cream I have the NYX sculpt in highlight
duo so it comes with the concealer and a
cream contour I love this particularly
for the cream contour the concealer
doesn't do too much for me but
definitely the cream contour has been
amazing and then the other one is the
pure cameo contour stick again same
thing concealer and cream contour side I
love it for the contour side kind of
funny how that works for powder bronzers
one is the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer everybody I feel like kind of
fell in love with this bronzer it got
super hyped up about its amazing
beautiful smells good and then the other
bronzer that also is beautiful amazing
and smells good is the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer this is another
one that's not necessarily just 2016 but
throughout the
I reached for it so much this is just a
deluxe sample size and I cannot believe
that I have not gone through this thing
yet because I use it all the time so for
blush of course I have to mention Milani
Luminoso I actually do believe that I
did buy this in 2016 because it was
getting so hyped about on YouTube that I
was finally like okay I'll just go and
get it beautiful blush beautiful peach
shimmer it's it is amazing and then two
other ones this one is actually included
in my best of beauty 2016 giveaway it's
from Smashbox they have these blush and
highlight trios that I have found
fantastic I've reached for them so much
not only for the blush but also for the
highlights in them I think they're
amazing I don't think enough people talk
about them they have big mirror in them
you need to travel with I love these
little guys I'm very impressed with them
and then the other one is one that I use
so often it's from Becca cosmetics and
Jaclyn hill it's the champagne glow face
palette so inside it comes with the two
highlighters but then the three blushes
this amaretto which is the middle shade
and Rosie spritz I feel like I don't
even have to say anything because I use
this palette all the time I'm constantly
talking about those two blush shades
beautiful blushes I actually did pick up
one of the split pants that has what
does it have an amaretto and Prosecco
pop I believe one of those flip pans in
the giveaway right now because you can't
actually purchase this anymore so I
picked out my two favorite shades from
inside here and put that into the
giveaway but these blushes mm-hmm they
just do something for me
now I'm gonna start going out of order
because now my list starts going all
over the place so just bear with me but
we're gonna talk about eyeliners next so
some eyeliners that I absolutely love
and just continue to rave about are the
color pop eyeliners I grabbed a few that
I own right here but I love the color
pop pencil eyeliners they're like five
or six dollars they're super affordable
very long-lasting creamy one of my
absolute favorites and I'm wearing it on
my eyes right now is get paid it's like
a metallic rose gold I mean these are
some of the best most affordable liners
around another one of my favorites that
I actually ran out of and I haven't had
the chance to repurchase yet is the it
cosmetics gel eyeliner love that
eyeliner I actually lost it it was very
that I think it fell out of my purse one
night when I was out and about and I was
like no and then to liquid eyeliners one
is from Maybelline it's the master
precise liner this is either my second
or third eyeliner I use this a lot it's
very nice if you're still practicing
your wing I thought the tip of the
eyeliner was very easy to kind of like
practice with so this turned out to be
one of my favorite eyeliners and I went
through it quite a bit and then another
favorite this is a gel liner but this is
from Sigma I don't feel like I need to
say a lot about this either because I
rave about this eyeliner is in a wicked
it is a gel liner I oh I'm getting
pretty close to being out and I would
have to buy a new one one of my favorite
favorite gel liners it is amazing so I
actually tried to be pretty stingy about
my highlighters I usually had a lot more
in my collection and then I wanted to
pick out my like truly absolute
favorites from 2016 they are both
high-end I don't really have a lot of
affordable highlighters that I found but
this one is from Marc Jacobs it is the
spotlight glow stick it is a gorgeous
like when I want a cream highlight this
is what I'm reaching for I was obsessed
with this in the summer it was like all
that I wore in the summer and it's super
easy to just throw on the bag you don't
have to worry about like breaking or
shattering or anything like that
this thing is bomb I'm coming back to
the Becca cosmetics and Jaclyn hill she
a pink glow face palette so inside the
two highlighters I mean these were both
absolute favorites this one is champagne
pop it got tons of hi tons of
recognition when Jacqueline Hill did the
collab with Becca cosmetics everybody
fell in love but with champagne pop but
then when she came out with another
collab she did Prosecco pop which is
more of a straight gold highlight and it
is gorgeous between these two highlights
I truly don't feel like I really need
anything else for my highlight game
because they gave me they give me a
little bit of everything
I love those two highlights in there and
then with the Marc Jacobs it's like I
mean I'm good I'm good okay eyeshadow
palettes were definitely hard for me to
narrow towns pair with me this was this
was one that was really challenging for
me to narrow down the eyeshadow palettes
that I loved throughout the year but one
is the
I shadow and highlight palette from
Carli bybel and BH Cosmetics I
especially love it for the eyeshadow so
I do have one of the highlighters on my
cheeks today I have this one on as my
highlight got this for my birthday this
past year from my mom and it just turned
into one of my favorite palettes it has
a nice mirror it was super easy to
travel with but I used this so often
this next palette was so incredibly
hyped up I mean I really don't feel like
I need to touch on this palette much at
all it's the Too Faced sweet peach
palette and as salty as I've been about
Too Faced over the white chocolate chip
palette release and like all of the
madness that went into that I still have
to give it to the peach palette because
it truly did turn into one of my
favorite palettes from the Year super
happy that I got it in the first launch
it is now back everybody can get it at
the time of filming it's still in stock
it's still there there really is just a
gorgeous beautiful palette it smells
delicious the shades are beautiful has a
mirror it's nice packaging it was
definitely worth the hype I wish all the
madness hadn't happened but if you
haven't picked it up yet it really is a
gorgeous eyeshadow palette this next one
was a palette that I didn't foresee
becoming a favorite of mine but as I was
doing makeup looks each day I felt my I
found myself constantly reaching for
this palette and it turned into one of
my favorites of the year is from
Smashbox cosmetics it's their fotomat
eyes palette so this is what the inside
looks like it has the mirror and it does
come with a double-ended brush I don't
know like on first glance it just looks
like a very neutral palette like you're
only gonna be able to get a few looks
out of it but it turned out to be one of
my favorites I used I used this for so
many different looks and I just
absolutely raved about it it isn't all
matte palette but I even loved the brush
that came inside I was using the brush I
traveled with this one a lot too but
yeah this one this one was a sneaky
favorite of 2016 this palette was one
that was also super hyped up super hard
to get it's now back anybody can get it
it's all good the hype has kind of died
down but it's from morphe brushes and it
is the 3/5 Oh palette so this is what
the inside looks like again I have to
say just like with the Too Faced line
this one got a lot of hype for a very
good reason I reach for it all the time
I just used it in my new
Eve makeup tutorial you can do so many
different looks with the beautiful matte
colors beautiful shimmer colors it's
just a fantastic palette and it's only a
20 $2.99 for 35 shades which is a great
deal it's another one that is in my
giveaway it is from Tarte cosmetics and
collaboration with style by her Uche it
is an eyeshadow palette it comes with
six eyeshadows and then it also comes
with a big old blush has a mirror it's
very travel friendly um you kind of very
like sleek and easy to travel with but
what I liked was that the eyeshadow pans
were not small they were decent sized
eyeshadow pants and then you also do get
a ginormous blush this was another one
that I didn't expect to become a
favorite of mine but it did I took it
everywhere with me I wore it for like
glammed up looks I wore it as a
bridesmaid look I just took it
everywhere with me and I really really
ended up loving this palette and then
the last one I want to talk about I
haven't had it for that long I've only
had it for about two months and I went
back and forth I should put it in my
best of beauty favorites video but I had
to because I knew that the hype again
around this one it was very real it took
me a while to get it because I was
always sold out but that is the modern
renaissance palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills oh yes
everybody lost it for this palette and
once again I have to say for a very good
reason again it has a mirror and then
all of these beautiful beautiful shades
I have created so many different looks
at them there's master shimmers and
oranges and pinks and just it is
incredibly beautiful it's a lot easier
to get your hands on now and so if you
haven't gotten it yet
I definitely say get it this was one of
my favorites from 2016 so I have some
single eyeshadows to touch on I don't
purchase a ton of single eyeshadows
because I mostly do palettes but I have
a few favorites that I thought I would
mention two are from colour-pop
cosmetics so super super affordable I
think they're like five dollars in
eyeshadow this one is in truth it's just
a really pretty like super light brown
kind of beige shade I actually really
love it in my crease that's what I have
in there right now and then I always on
top well layer la la which is a really
fun again kind of like kind of metallic
rose gold shade truth Amala are what i
wear together all the time it's like one
of my
every day go to super super easy looks I
just really really love them so I wear
these a ton and then from Anastasi
Beverly Hills I found two eyeshadows I
just kind of like made my own little
palette here but I have these top two
shadows are some of my favorites this
one is in Birkin which is just a perfect
transition shade and then the other one
is in Bert orange which actually can be
found in the modern renaissance palette
but I got these single shades before I
got the modern renaissance and I became
obsessed with burnt orange when I'm in a
hurry or just need a quick look I will
put burnt orange all over my lids like
really softly with a like really big
fluffy brush and then blend it on my
lower lash line as well and I'm done
like I love that shade so much so those
are some of my favorite single shadows
from 2016 okay and then some of my
favorite mascaras this one is the
Maybelline lash sensational I talked
about this one all the time it's my
favorite drugstore mascara like
hands-down I don't find a ton of
drugstore mascaras that I love but the
last lash sensational is fantastic and
then some high-end this one is the
Smashbox x-rated I just have a little
sample guy of it but I actually would
repurchase this in a full size because
that is how much I love it which was
crazy to me for someone who wears false
lashes lashes as much as I do it just
surprises me when I fall in love with
mascaras so hard but then another
absolute fave is from benefit and this
is their roller lash I really do love
that they're real mascara as well but I
was trying my best to pick my absolute
favorites from the year and roller lash
actually beat it out for me it just does
amazing things add a lengthening of the
eyelashes and I just think it's a
gorgeous mascara I reach for this all
the time when I'm not wearing falsies so
speaking of false lashes I have a couple
that I want to mention I don't have them
here cuz I don't have like the boxes
anymore like it would be weird just
showing you like individual eyelashes I
don't know but some of my favorites are
the Ardell whispies you can never go
wrong with Ardell if you're new to
lashes check on Ardell super inexpensive
eating freedom at drugstores very easy
to work with another is the eye lower
lashes in collaboration with Vegas nay
the grand glamour lashes I wear them all
the time they're super bold
super glam I find them to be absolutely
amazing another favorite from 2016 is
the huda beauty lashes in Samantha just
picked me up another pair because my
first pair had to be thrown away they
were so used and so loved it got myself
a new pair some of my favorite favorite
lashes and then actually a lash that
kind of like snuck up on me when I first
used him I just thought they were okay
but as I've been wearing them more I
fell completely in love with them they
are from flutter lashes and
collaboration with makeup Shayla and
it's the I slay lashes they are amazing
I wore them the entire weekend during
our Christmas weekend this past weekend
I worm every single day to each event th
family members house I I just really
ended up loving those lashes so those
are some of my favorite lashes from 2016
so I have a few others that I put in the
other category to check but before we
get into lips cuz that's probably gonna
be my biggest category but I'm some brow
products are from benefit I really loved
on the goof proof pencil and then also
the gimme brow these were new purchases
in 2016 because I realized if you have a
beauty YouTube channel you apparently
muster your eyebrows err no one will
believe that you know what you're
talking about if you guys don't know
what I'm talking about
I'll leave my video link down below
about the benefit brushed our brows or I
kind of go into more detail about what
this all means but yeah these are really
really awesome products of the goof
proof pencil is really easy to use as a
newbie to eyebrows and then the gimme
brow is just a like volumizing fiber
brow gel looks like this you just run it
through your brows it helps give them
some volume and then also kind of cleans
them up a little bit so these are both
been really good for a brow newbie
then I have to a favorite makeup sponges
from the year I've used them both
recently so they're very dirty so I'm
not gonna show you them but one was the
Beauty Blender I mean just the Beauty
Blender in general I absolutely loved on
in 2016 I purchased my first a Beauty
Blender in 2016 it was very exciting
I've tried out the nude one but I've
really come to love the Black Beauty
Blender that's actually both of these
makeup sponges are actually in my best
of beauty giveaway the black one I don't
know I just feel like it has so much
bounce it's super easy to clean and it
actually
kind of hides the makeup which I would
have thought the nude would have hit it
better but it doesn't the black all the
way so been loving that one and then
also the diamond sponge from Real
Techniques I did a full video about the
sponge I love it I've already bought
another one I bought it they were having
like a buy one get one half off when I
purchase it for the giveaway and I was
like I'm gonna pick up another one for
myself as backup those were my favorite
makeup sponges throughout the year okay
and then last but not least I have lips
and it kind of made me laugh because as
I pulled them all out when to pick them
up if they're they're mostly the same
color which that gave me a good chuckle
whoa okay but let's see just to jump
right in I knew that lips I was gonna
have the most in here so I saved it for
last but this one is a color dolt from
Maybelline this is in my giveaway as
well it's been stripped down it's just a
beautiful nude pink Brown you're
probably gonna get tired of hearing me
say that but these are another one that
I didn't expect to be a favorite but
they are super long lasting and very
very pigmented really really good
lippies I became obsessed with the NYX
soft matte lip creams in 2016 I was so
excited to give them a try so many
people talked about them I particularly
love London and Abu Dhabi they're very
similar in shades like a nude brown but
this one is a little bit more of like um
has looked like some cinnamon to it
where this is just like a really basic
nude brown but I love both of these then
also from NYX I liked their lip lingerie
no I loved their lip lingerie liquid
lipsticks I have mine in bedtime flirt
and ruffle trim and I just absolutely
love these shades the entire lingerie
line is focused on nudes you can see the
play on words there so it's just an
entire range of nudes so I picked out
two of my absolute favorites and these
are it one of these is and they give
away too I can't remember which one but
one of them is I really do like the
colour-pop cosmetics Alypius I've loved
their ultra matte I've recently really
fallen in love with their ultra satins
and I have two of the ultra statins that
were my favorite throughout 2016 these
are both in collaboration with youtuber
kathleenlights this one is in point zero
and then this one
in November I think November is like the
only like pink shade that I have in here
it's a really beautiful bright deeper
pink I don't know that makes any sense
but it is a beautiful shade and then
point-0 is a really cool kind of like
cool toned Brown gray I am wearing it in
my New Year's Eve makeup tutorial so
make sure you check that one out but I
love these I love the ultra satin
formula so much and then for my high-end
lipsticks this was the winner of the
indie makeup brand of the year I believe
it was was Kylie cosmetics that is not
shocking to me at all but I loved on her
candy a liquid lipstick candy Kay liquid
lipstick from Kylie is a beautiful nude
pink shade very very long-lasting it's
super comfortable on the lips I wore
this one a ton a ton throughout 2016
another one of my absolute favorites is
bow-and-arrow from Kat Von D another
nude brown and just a gorgeous shade
again super long-lasting very
comfortable on the lips I went through a
period of probably like a month where
this was like pretty much the only thing
I wore and if I was going out this was
the only lipstick ice ring with me it
was a true obsession and then this was a
very very recent favorite but again ones
that I just fell in love with so hard
that I knew I had to mention them it are
the liquid lipsticks from huda beauty I
have my shades in trendsetter and
bombshell these came in a set so these
are mini liquid lipsticks and then it
came also in a set with a full-size lip
liner I fell in love with both of these
shades
I actually took bombshell which is more
of the nude pink trendsetter as more
nude Brown I took bombshell at home with
me for the holidays and wore it again
like all three nights I think I wore
bombshell I absolutely loved it the set
from huda beauty is included in my
giveaway too so you have to check out
that giveaway if you haven't yet but
these liquid lipsticks are amazing I
definitely want more alright guys I
think we have made it through my best of
beauty at 2016 we have completely lost
the light I know that it's taken me a
long time to film this video and
hopefully I didn't make it too long I
actually for some reason had like a wild
hair and thought that I would talk
like skincare products and even like
makeup brushes I don't know why I
thought I'd be able to fit all that in
but I can see from my timestamp that
this is going to be a long video already
so that is where I'm going to cut it off
