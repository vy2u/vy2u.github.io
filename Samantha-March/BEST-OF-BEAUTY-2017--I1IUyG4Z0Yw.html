today's video I'm so excited to do it is
going to be my best of beauty at 2017
video I'm gonna be chatting about all of
my most most favoritest products
throughout the year is that a work
favorite is just know I've gone back and
watched my favorite videos I have
scoured through my makeup collection and
I am picking out my top top products in
each category that I fell in love with
throughout the year of 2017 and that I
would highly recommend I'm so excited to
do this video I've been looking forward
to it for such a long time so if you are
ready to see my favorites from the year
of 2017 it's gonna be a long one
so let's get started I guess I've been
working on this video for a while
watching my old favorites videos and
just going through my collection and
seeing which items that I loved on the
entire year and I was so worried of
someone my snapchat last night that I
remember feeling this way too when I did
my 2016 video like I'm so paranoid I'm
gonna leave hop my most favorite product
I'm like I keep looking over my
collection like if I'm missing am I
missing anything but I know we have a
lot to talk about but I'm gonna jump in
with primers I have two primers here
that I would highly recommend and that I
have been enjoying so much myself this
is the number 7 airbrush away primer
you're gonna see number seven featured
quite a bit in here I really do like
their products but this primer is one of
my favorites does help to kind of soften
everything it's kind of like a
moisturizing primer at the same time and
I really enjoy it and then this one from
amazing cosmetics is their anti-aging
face primer this one does feel a little
bit more silicone it does kind of help
fill in the pores and kind of the fine
lines and it's supposed to be a
anti-aging moisturizer at at the same
time it says it's a primer and
moisturizer all in one so these two at
number seven and amazing cosmetics have
been my go-to primers throughout the
year foundations I had a lot to choose
from because to me 2017 was like the
year of trying the foundations for me I
think it really kicked off in the
springtime I all of a sudden became
obsessed with finding and new
foundations to try I have two here that
are drugstore one again is from number
seven this is their stay perfect of
foundation this instantly turned into
one of my favorite foundations I think
it is so nice it is so long wearing it's
a good medium coverage of foundation and
I really enjoy it the other one is from
covergirl this is the vitalist healthy
elixir foundation again a foundation
that I took to almost immediately I
really like this one I
like it's just a really natural finish
to the skin and I really enjoy that
about it it has a nice medium coverage
as well and so both of these from the
drugstore I would highly recommend
moving over to a some high-end
foundations one here that I think I've
had the longest is from Tarte this is
the rainforest of the sea foundation I
mean if you can tell that I have really
enjoyed this foundation like you can see
a considerable dent in here with this
one I really enjoy this foundation the
only thing I don't love about it is the
dropper form it's the only thing that
drives me crazy but I still reach for
this so often it is so long wearing and
relieves a really beautiful coverage on
the skin the other one this might be is
this my favorite part I don't know it's
all hard to pick like my absolute
absolute favorite but this one is man I
love this foundation this is the Lancome
1/10 eabdul Ultra wear a foundation mmm
I love this foundation I have it in
multiple different shades and I just
think it is one of the best it makes my
skin look so freakin good
really really enjoy this one would
highly recommend if you haven't tried it
out yet and then also the Urban Decay
Naked skin one and done I have featured
this so many times I've put it in
favourites videos I absolutely love this
it's kind of like a hybrid type of
foundation but to me honestly it feels
more just like a regular foundation like
it covers like a regular foundation but
it feels super super lightweight on the
skin this is one of my absolute
favorites like standout products of the
year for sure the urban decay wanted
done I have a couple favourite
concealers here I've been trying out
quite a few concealers as well but these
two are really like my standout products
I didn't want every category to have
like a bajillion products which really I
could have but I really tried to focus
down and narrow it down on what I
absolutely love like what I would
repurchase what I want to have in my
collection and that sort of thing my two
favorite concealers the first one here
is from urban decay this is the naked
skin weightless complete coverage
concealer again I've mentioned this
quite a bit recently but it just really
turned into one of my favorite
concealers it surpassed of the shape
tape for me I love The Naked skin
concealer I wish I would have tried it
sooner this one here is from a Kevyn
Aucoin I think it's called the super
natural concealer but if you can see in
this one too can you see here like I've
made a considerable dent into this one
as well and I actually have two shades
of this so to be sure
well done did a concealer I think is
pretty good excite a few concealers but
I really really like this one it has a
it's a bit more full coverage and just
like I put on the drier side so
sometimes that's not always my favorite
but I love the coverage that it gives
and I love the way it blends out I think
it looks really nice on the under eyes
so Urban Decay and coming to Quan these
have been my go-to concealers so moving
over I wanted to touch on some face
palettes that I love some more
affordable options I really really
enjoyed these elf duos I have mine indie
shades bronzed pink beige and then also
Saint Lucia I really really like Saint
Lucia actually I think this one might
actually be my favorite of the two it's
just a really nice a bronzer and then
that's kind of like a blush highlight to
me but then the other one that I have
here this one is from the aqua
collection so they're kind of like
creamy bronzer and blush but these are
both really nice and really nice
affordable options from ELF so I really
enjoyed these duo's
I've bought this one quite a bit as well
but this is from a flower beauty they
lift and sculpt contouring palette I've
used it so much I have actually broke my
bronzer because it got so thin because I
use a saw but I broke it the blush is
the next to go I reach for this one it's
so often I think all the shades are so
beautiful the highlight I am so shocked
I have not hit pan or wrote that
highlight yet because it's a beautiful
really kind of like light golden
highlight I think it's gorgeous so these
are both really good affordable face
products from the drugstore the more
high-end options I was really surprised
that I ended up loving these so much
these are lorac cosmetics face palettes
these are both collaborations that they
did this one is with Pirates of the
Caribbean so we just have some different
blush shades and also highlight shades
and the other one is the collaboration
with a Beauty and the Beast so in here
we have a blush and highlight shades but
these totally turned me on to lorac face
products I actually did try the
eyeshadow palettes from both of these
collapse with the face products the face
palettes are the ones that stood out to
me specifically so if you haven't tried
the rock face products yet if you can
still get your hands on these I would
recommend it I know I saw him come back
on the lorac website fairly recently so
I don't know if they'll keep bringing
these kind of items back people have
said that they've seen them at Kohl's as
well so if you can see them and pick
them up I would highly recommend it I
actually like the Beauty and the Beast
just a little bit more than beautiful
blushes in here and
or just highlight but I was very
impressed and honestly a little bit
shocked how much I love these palette is
also an eyeshadow palette but I really
love it for the face products this is
from a Pierre cosmetics it's one of
their vanity palettes in gold-digger
it's a really cool palette concept you
can kind of pop up the mirror here to
make a palette and you have eyes shadow
shades but then you also have a bronzer
blush and highlight and I love the
bronzer blush and highlight in here so I
wanted to include it in the face a
palette category over here but I really
enjoyed this palette I feel like this is
such an underrated makeup product and
more viewers will be raving about these
but especially for the face I love those
three products I talked about this one
quite a bit as well but this is the
Kevin of Kwan a contouring book oh man
Kevin appliance products are I mean
truly I believe that they are worth of
the hype that they get I really enjoyed
this book you have a cream contour the
sculpting powder which is so highly
raved about also a cream highlight and
then the powder highlight which is
absolutely gorgeous and just kind of
like your your basic neutrals to create
a really pretty eye look down here it
has a nice mirror I talk about this all
the time this comes traveling with me
quite a bit it's a really nice product
and lastly here this is a bit of a newer
product but I knew I had to mention it
because I felt like hard and fast for
this this is the Becca a price ski glow
face palette so inside you have the
bossiest mirror of life you also have a
bronzer of blush and then three
different highlights I love every single
shade in here I can use every single
shade in here I have to get a little bit
creative because this highlight right
here is a little bit dark for me but I
love mixing it with icicle I think it's
just absolutely gorgeous so this palette
totally stole my heart right away I
believe it is still available I think
it's gonna be a limited edition product
I think but I believe it is still
available now and I would HIGHLY highly
recommend it alright so moving on I'm
going to talk about some of my favorite
blush and bronzers and some of my
singles that I have here so one of my
favorites lushes this was from a way
back from the beginning of the year it
was mentioned in like my January or
February famous video but it still is a
favorite this is from a pixie Beauty
it's in collaboration with Aspen of art
and it is the glowy powder or blush in
realm rose this is such a beautiful
blush it has a light shimmer to it and
it's absolutely gorgeous that's still
one of my favorite blushes I just
recently did a blush declutter and I was
like yeah I know this one is going
absolutely nowhere I love it another one
of my favorite blushes is
from the Sigma Beauty this is the core
to Rosa or a powder and I said in my
declutter when I said I was keeping this
one that I don't think enough people
talk about this blush I think it's
absolutely gorgeous and beautiful
terracotta shade very pigmented last on
the cheeks all day I love this blush and
then some more of my recent favorite
blushes I first tried my very first Hart
blush in March because I got it as a
birthday gift at Sephora and I have now
fallen in love with the Tarte Amazonian
clay blushes I have two here I also have
a blush palette
I think the Tarte blushes are so good
and again very very long-lasting so
moving on to a few of single bronzers
that I would recommend one here is again
from number seven I love so many of
number seven products this is the
caramel bronzer I think it's fantastic
it's a drugstore bronzer it's more
affordable but great packaging a lot of
product a mirror I don't think you can
go wrong there and you and I have
another Sigma product here this is
another aura powder but this one is a
bronzer and it isn't in the saddle is
more of a newer product to me I think I
got it at like the end of summer but
it's absolutely gorgeous
again very pigmented a light hand will
get you a very faraway but it's a really
beautiful bronzer if she's wearing it
the other day and then this bronzer I
love this brother as well this is from
Urban Decay this is the beach bronzer or
the sunkissed bronzer oh my goodness I
love this bronzer I think is so
beautiful especially it's like a bit of
a lighter bronzer so especially for like
my wintertime pale on this hello
this will be a really nice bronzer so
this one from Urban Decay is another
favorite so those are three bronzers
that I recommend pick over to some of my
favorite eyeshadow palette okay so the
first one I have here is from BH
Cosmetics and Curly Bible this is their
deluxe edition palette so it's the newer
version that released in at 2017 so you
have eyes shadows and then also
highlights all of these are beautiful
the eyeshadows are just stunning and I
love the shade selection in here but the
highlights are really what I feel is
like the bomb-diggity part of this
eyeshadow palette there are some
gorgeous gorgeous highlights in here and
again a bunch of different tones for
different skin tones and it has a really
nice mirror and I love the packaging and
it's very affordable and you can find a
delta of course everything will be
linked down below is gonna take me
forever to fill up this description box
another affordable palette or just
products eyeshadow
in general that I would recommend is
from colour-pop I really really
recommend they're pressed eyeshadows I
was never a huge fan of these super
shock shadows but when they release
their pressed eyeshadows very impressed
here I'm just holding the colour-pop and
I love Sarah II collaboration she did
two different eye shadow pellets with
them but I have another palette with
pressed eyeshadow so you can buy them as
singles you can buy them in palettes I
just got the yesplease palette fairly
recently and then I just picked up the
all I see is magic and also the
kathleenlights most recent collab I said
I wanted to add more color palettes to
my collection and I've done a really
good job doing that but the press
eyeshadows are fantastic and they're
very affordable
I think the kathleenlights palette was
$16 all I see is magic it's $20 very
affordable I shadow pellets and for a
really good price I have a couple
pallets here from morphe morphe is
considered more affordable and this
first palette i would say is more
affordable this is the new a3 502 not
released this year this is a really
freaking nice eye shadow palette like a
really nice very warm toned eyeshadow
palette but it has beautiful pops of
colors in here gorgeous eyeshadow
palette for $23 and now find morphe and
this palette on the alte website which i
think is fantastic but I love that
actual palette I still continually reach
for it another morphe palette I have
here but it's not really as affordable
so it's gonna put it as we transition
into the higher-end products but of
course it's the Jaclyn hill palette this
really is like one of my like top three
palace of the year it's just a really
fantastic I shadow palette this is a
gorgeous eyeshadow palette you have so
many selections in here the shades are
just bomb diggity is a truly amazing
eyeshadow palette I travel with it I
reach for it all the time this is one of
those that I know is not going to fail
me and I think it's fantastic I think
it's like $38 though so it is a little
bit more expensive for morphe you know
I'm gonna talk about some other higher
price palettes here but for the more
people I know people kind of got thrown
through a loop including myself when the
price was released but it's a really
nice quality actually I'll tell it and
one that I would recommend a few more
palettes I have here to talk about this
is from a dose of colors this is the
marvelous Moss eyeshadow palette this
was one of my very first products ever
that I purchased from dulcet colors you
will see them mentioned again here in
this video this eyeshadow palette is
bomb I take this one with me all the
time as well it's beautiful
locked own eyeshadow palette I think
it's gorgeous the colors are beautiful
it blends really nice it is $32 for five
shades so that is not inexpensive but
you can find at these at Ulta now you
can use your points and all that but I
highly recommend this and I am planning
on purchasing more dos eyeshadow
palettes in the very near future here
and then another palette you guys knew
you knew this palette was coming this is
the Tarte clay play palette oh my gosh I
love this palette it has a shadows in
here and it also has contour and bronzer
shades for me as well but it's mostly
eyeshadows and I really really enjoyed
the eyeshadows of course they're like my
tones the Browns and the neutrals and
the math is all my eyeshadow palette and
all matte face colors as well but it's a
beautiful palette I love the mirror I'm
shocked to see that the clay plate was
coming out I like kind of lost my vision
my latest will I buy a video yes all
that if you saw that video but I love
this palette I'm very very happy with it
one of my favorites of the year and then
this other palette here I am like I'm
surprised it's a newer palette to me for
sure and I kind of went back and forth
on if I should include it but I reached
for it so often and I want to continue
to play with it and I just think it's a
really good eye shadow palette but it's
the Kat Von D a in the center I wasn't
even gonna buy this palette my friend
live from live loves her makeup but
bought it sent it to me and she said I
just have a feeling you would really
like this palette and I'm like damn girl
we haven't even known each other that
long and we only know each other through
the internet how did you know that about
me like it kind of blows my mind a
little bit but I really do enjoy this
eyeshadow palette and I like that it's
such an all-inclusive palette you know I
don't have to reach into any other
palette for any of their shade like if
I'm picking up one eye shadow palettes
like okay but first I need to reach into
this other palette for you know my matte
white shade no got it in here oh I need
to reach into the other palette for a
lighter transition a darker transition
nope in here I need to reach in there
for a different glare a different nope
this palette literally has it all in
here and I just reached for it so often
and I'm surprised and not every single
shade knocks it out of the park for me
but it's still a really nice
all-inclusive eyeshadow palette I find
myself reaching for it a ton I'm totally
taken off-guard by that but I feel like
it would be a disservice if I did not
put it in this video I feel like I would
be
if I said this wasn't one of my absolute
favorites from the year so and did not
see that coming a few more iProducts to
chat about in general here but to are
going speak letters but the first
glitter is the urban decay heavy metal
glitter liner I love these I love these
I don't know if this made it for sure
into my 2016 favorites video I want to
say it didn't because I fell in love
with them towards the end of the year
and I thought it was too soon to include
them in my best of beauty video I think
that's how these works but no these are
phenomenal I recently got even more
shades from Urban Decay and I've been
trying almost every single one of them
and they are just beautiful I have some
of the glitter of this one right here
Midnight Cowboy which this is the one I
did purchase myself I have that on my
lower lash line just for a little added
pop of glitter and I love these liners I
think they are so good the other
glitters that I would recommend are the
Stila glitters these are freaking
phenomenal I just grabbed a couple
shades here just kind of at random
it's the Magnificent metals glitter and
glow that's their proper name and
described a couple random ones here but
honestly I tried so many once again and
I think that they're all great they make
such a beautiful glitter looks I haven't
had problems with them stinging my eyes
with a ton of glitter fallout so I've
been very very impressed with these and
then another liner that I wanted to give
a shout out to is from DHS see this is
their liquid eyeliner I have it on today
this is my go-to liner for a wing I
think it just is so easy to work with
and easy to use this is what the liner
looks like you can find it on the DHD
website are also on Amazon but it really
is my go-to liner already have a backup
on hand ready to go for when I went out
of this which I know is going to be very
soon we are getting down there I already
have my backup ready to go it's just one
of my favorite liners so I wanted to get
that a shout out to all righty so next
time I'm going to talk about lashes this
is going to come as no surprise that my
favorite pair of false lashes in 2017
we're from pure cosmetics I absolutely
adore the pure lashes I can't get enough
of them I'm constantly wearing them and
constantly recommending them I do have
the style diva on my eyes today I have
some bombshell lashes here I just
stocked up on my latest alcohol because
they finally came back in stock I think
everybody else is starting to realize
how fantastic these pure lashes are even
if you're someone who is
great with lashes yet these pants are
super easy to work with and they have a
variety of different styles to choose
from soap here is definitely my favorite
a newer favorite though that I started
purchasing from I wanna say it was
around summertime these are from
blinking beauty they are now available
at Sephora I have the style as a bum
bust and a Coquette here I purchased
coke at first and I liked him so much
that I went ahead and purchased another
style from them and these are pricey
pretty lashes at $25 appear are only $14
so I always purchase these with some
sort of a discount or gift card or
something but I really do like them and
I find myself reaching for both of these
styles of quite a bit and then moving on
to some favorite mascaras I did want to
include some mascaras in here too that
are more affordable one is from Catrice
cosmetics this is the rocket or extreme
Volume Mascara this is a really freaking
good mascara this was like my go-to
summer mascara it's waterproof it's a
long wearing it makes the lashes really
long I really enjoyed this one and
probably my favorite drugstore mascara
that I tried this year is from a flower
beauty this is their zoom in three and
one mascara the wand is really
interesting because you can change it I
actually just used it today but you can
change it from if you can see how it's
kind of like curled there you can
actually change it to three different
styles and then this is the third style
so you get four lengths of volume and
curl and I just love this mascara I
think it is so nice so I would highly
recommend the flower beauty and then two
that are a little bit higher price this
one is also from pierre the make good
mascara - this is the big look at
mascara this actually made it into a
favorites video throughout the year i
just used this the other day and it get
ready with me video and I had someone
snap me and say what was that mascara
that you used in the video that made you
look like you had false lashes and I
said it was the pure fake look so I love
this mascara I think it is so good and
then my other favorite and kind of go to
mascara when I'm not gonna wear false
lashes this is from a YSL this is the
shoc mascara I have a little deluxe
sized version here because I must like
do wear false lashes it's hard for me to
justify spending a lot of money on
mascaras so like these little deluxe
sized samples for higher prices they
work just fine for me because honestly
they probably expire before I can finish
using them because
we're falsies so much but why I saw the
shock is a freaking bomb mascara as well
do have one brow product that I want to
recommend it's just been fairly recently
that I started to really try to expand
my brow products and I did mention my
favorite benefit products in last year's
at best a beauty 2016 video but the one
that I have really been loving on since
I think it was like spring summer time
is from thrive cosmetics and this is
just their eyebrow pencil and I have
mine in the shade Audrey is so nice it
is so easy to use I highly recommend
this one I included the rival cosmetics
in the 8 brands I think you should try
it in 2018 and if you're looking for
really easy to use brow pencil again I'm
not with the bus with brows so when I
could get the hang of this one right
away and it turned into a favorite I
thought that was pretty cool already I
wanted to talk about some of my favorite
highlights here so some more affordable
highlights this one is from essence and
this is the pure nude highlighter I feel
like so many people talked about this
one and rave about this one I recently
just tried it out in 2017 but yes it is
phenomenal I was just wearing it the
other day it's a really nice subtle
highlight it just gives a really
beautiful glow to the cheek bones I
loved it when I went on my birthday trip
to Colorado I had to pack this one I
thought it was beautiful
and then another one that is more
affordable again this is from a pixie in
collaboration with Aspen over these
products are really really good you can
get pixie at Target as well they're a
little bit higher priced for affordable
options but they're still not high-end
prices if you know what I'm saying this
is the glowy powder and at santorini
sunset and again i just think it is such
a gorgeous a stunning highlight and you
really don't need to work to get a
beautiful glow and then some higher-end
products here I have the Smashbox and
Casey Holmes spotlight palette I have
mine in Pearl there were two different
options this is a beautiful highlight
palette I am so happy that I picked it
up and it is still available right now
and I love all three I wear all three
separately I wear all three mixed
together I think it is a gorgeous
palette and then another one I have here
is a from Lancome this is the dual
finished highlighter and I have mine in
the shade a sparkling peach and I was
absolutely shocked shocked how much I
love this highlight it is gorgeous it is
blinding if you want to be seen from
space
this highlight is going to do it for you
and you need like the tie
but it is gorgeous and then lastly you
guys know you know what I'm gonna say
you know what I'm gonna say it is Urban
Decay sin I got this one and trying
subscribers favorite makeup y'all told
me I needed this one and y'all did not
steer me wrong one of my absolute
favorite like standout products from the
year was the Urban Decay sin highlight
it is gorgeous absolutely love it so
those are some of my favorite single
highlights from the year let's talk
about some lip products this was so hard
I really tried my best to narrow it down
as best as I could but some of my
favorite lip products that from the year
2017 was the first time that I tried at
the NYX liquid suede lipsticks and I
fell in love with them I really enjoyed
this formula it's a very comfortable at
liquid lipstick then on the transfers
that like it'll kind of get into certain
spots but a dry sound fairly nicely yeah
I mean just a beautiful formula and I
love so many of the colors in there I
just grabbed out kitten heels which is a
terrific read then also I believe this
one is a sandstorm which is a nude but
so many beautiful colors in there and
fun colors in the collection as well and
they are affordable
I did mention Kat Von D and her liquid
lipsticks and last year's video but I
was mostly talking about faux and arrow
I have another color that I fell in love
with this year and it is a Ludwig I have
a many of this as well that I always
carry around in my clutch because it's
one of my favorite shades and I love
this formula still another item that I
was recently introduced to in at 2017
these are the Tarte rainforest of the
sea lipsticks I have like four or five
different shades now and I just think
that they are so stunning and they are a
regular lipstick I have nudes i have
reds i've pink nudes beautiful beautiful
creamy lipstick formula but very
long-lasting pretty recently what
lipstick to me is from a sigma beauty
and really i have these two here and i
really do enjoy the formula but i also
wanted to give a special shout out to
this color because i have been obsessed
with this color i wore this color in
back-to-back videos earlier this year
which i don't think ever happens I don't
think I've ever ever done that but I
love that color so much it's like a
bright berry and it's so beautiful it is
called Fox Club I should probably tell
you what it's called it's called Fox
Club but it's a really nice long wearing
a liquid lipstick so I was really
surprised that I love these so much but
especially this color had to give a
special shout out
if 17 was also the first time I was
trying a matte lipsticks I guess I'm
sent to me for my birthday from a friend
which is super cool and I was also very
blessed in 2017 to catch Mac's attention
and get some PR packages from them but I
really enjoyed their lipsticks but I
enjoyed their needs so much like the
regular lipsticks but almost every
single nude I've tried from Mac I loved
so much I actually went to pull out my
favorite which is called age sex
location of course that's my favorite
lipstick out of the bunch it was the
collab with Nicki Minaj but it's a
gorgeous nude and I think it's actually
still in my clutch I just bought out the
other weekend and I think it is
beautiful but they're nude lipsticks are
gorgeous but also this is one of my
favorite nude liquid lipsticks and I've
been wearing it so much it is called
burnt spice beautiful nude lipstick I
don't feel like the MAC lipsticks are
the longest wearing a liquid lipsticks
but they are easy to reapply and burnt
spices just favorite this video is that
you so long to film I just sent a
turmeric light on self my lighting
changed it's because the guys art and I
had to bust out the ring light but some
more lip products that I fell in love
with in 2017 are from dose of colors I
talk about these all the time I just
featured but like for lipsticks in my
Black Friday haul that I picked up from
dose of colors I really really enjoyed
their liquid lipsticks and also probably
to no surprise is over cosmetics I now
have a ton of over lipstick throughout
2017 and they are also some of my
favorites I feel like they're really
long lasting and really nice liquid
lipsticks another regular lipstick that
I really enjoy our from milk makeup
these are the lip colors I just like
these as a regular lipstick I feel like
they're very long-lasting I have the
nude which is called cream that one is
in my clutch all the time it's so nice
just to like touch up anytime anywhere I
just feel like it's such a beautiful
nude and I really like the way that
these look on my lips I have so many of
these because I really like the formula
I think that they're really good so the
milk and makeup lip colors and then
finally I want to talk about some Marc
Jacobs products one is what I have on my
lips today this is in the shade Kiss
Kiss Bang Bang it's one of the little
mark lip cremes and I really like these
I'm not sure I can't remember if I
featured these in last year's 2016 best
of beauty because I have another shade
called slow burn and I absolutely love
it but it's such a nice formula it's a
very beautiful creamy lipstick but it
lasts
a really long time which is awesome but
I also love this color this is my newest
color from them and I think it is
beautiful and then also I wanted to
mention that the Marc Jacobs sugar sugar
gloss and I check to make sure that this
wasn't in my 2016 video and it wasn't
and I think it was because I purchased
it during Black Friday sales and so I
think when I was making at my best of
beauty video last year I was like is it
too soon to put it in there but I wanted
to put it in there because I love this I
also have a travel sized version of it
always in my clutch because I reached
for it almost every single time I am out
and about I love this glass I think it's
beautiful it's very pricey but I think
it's beautiful so those are some of my
favorite lip products in 2017 before I
move over to some brushes and tools I
did just want to mention this kind of
random one because I feel like this
product can't change my life this summer
coz from Evita Liberata and it is their
body blur I love this so much I have
mine in the shade medium which is
typically what I wore in the summer but
it was so nice because it just kind of
gives like a little bit of a but like a
can to the legs it's not like a true
self tanner but it gets just like a
little bit of boost of color and has a
little bit of shine to it but I felt
like it really helped cover like
imperfections like kind of the lumps and
bumps that you can have like on your
legs or your thighs or your hips or
things like that because I'm someone
who's pretty self-conscious in a
swimsuit and we do a lot of boating and
activities like that throughout the
summer always always always had my body
flirt with me because it just gives me
that little extra boost of confidence
like this is something that I don't feel
like I can go without so the body blur I
mean this was like a huge favorite
throughout the year so moving on to some
of my favorite makeup brushes I did do a
favorite makeup brushes earlier in the
year so I'll have that one link down
below too but I wanted to give a special
shout out to just a few I really wanted
this mostly to be focused on makeup
since I do separate brush videos from
time to time but just a few that I want
to touch on that I really enjoyed in
2017 this was a new brush from Sigma
Beauty it just came out this year this
is the 3d HD max kabuki it's a
foundation brush and I really really
enjoy it I think it applies so easily
but also so quickly because it's so big
but it also has these contours here that
it's not like you're getting a
foundation where you shouldn't get
foundation it's like contours the face
nicely as well while you're putting
foundation on and I really enjoy that
brush and then the other one you guys
probably see me
about this and see we use it all the
time but this is the sl3 highlighting
brush it is just my favorite
highlighting brush I just put a backup
of this because I love the Prussia so
much this what I have here is a little
bit random this is from ELF cosmetics
it's the 104 brush but I use it for
powder contour and I just feel like it
fits really nicely right up in there I
really like it and it's really
affordable to ask the more affordable
brushes are you royal and langnickel
these are the Emotiv metallic brushes I
especially love both of these this one I
use a for bronzer and this one I use for
contour and a lot of these I reach for
them so much I do a ton of Instagram
tutorials and I bet you probably see
these quite a bit because I think that
they Rock and then some morphe brushes
that I really love this year I grabbed
these two out from the copper dreams
brush set it's a really nice brush set
with face and eye brushes I personally
thought the eye brushes for like miles
better than the face brushes in there
but it also came with a nice case it
kind of goes in and out of stock because
I think people realize that they are
really nice brushes in there especially
the blending brushes but even though I
shade our brushes and the pencil brush
all really nice in that set and then the
other standout brush to me from morphe
was the art - this is a big fat bronzer
brush and I love it I think it is so
beautiful it's a little bit more
expensive because it's from the rose
gold line but still a pretty affordable
brush and I think it's pretty fantastic
finally I want to end with some Beauty
sponges and there are all dirty because
that is how I roll but I have a lot of
beauty sponges in here there's one I
have up here is from morphe I really
really enjoyed this sponge and also the
L'Oreal sponge these are both pretty
similar to one another in shape and then
also I feel like they work really really
similar to one another I don't know if I
have a favorite between the two because
I think that they've both Rock and
they're both around the same price point
and you can find them at Ulta another
one that I love I just use this one too
is from a flower Beauty I just mentioned
this sponge not too long ago else I
mentioned a flower beauty and the eight
brands I think you should try in 28
teens I know they're a favorite sponge
of mine though I'm super soft and I just
think it's pretty fantastic and also a
more affordable and then this one here
is from SL miss glamorous almost glam
Beauty I also mentioned her and aprons I
think you should try in 2018 and again
this is just one of my favorite Beauty
sponges I love the pretty pink pastel
color but comparable as well to the
flower Beauty kind of this thing
shape and then they each have a little
slope on it to which I really like
for concealer so those are four of my
favorite and beauty sponges that I tried
throughout 2017 and after that whoa
that's gonna do it for this video
arystar need those know what's not that
was a bad idea
I guess so that's gonna be everything
for my best of beauty 2017 video I know
that this one was super long even though

favorite favorite favorite items from

probably still a longer one so thank you
