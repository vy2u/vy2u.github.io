today's video is going to be a new best
and worst video and point-c all about
drugs to our foundations this video has

very excited to sit down pull out all of

best or the worst category before we get

worst drugstore foundations so first up
I do want to say if you follow me on
snapchat you know that our air
conditioning in our house went out so
I'm currently filming in an 86 degree
room I am sweating like crazy I'm going
to try to get to this video as fast as I
can but I look disheveled and you can
tell that I'm sweating it's because I am
it's 86 degrees and we have not had air
conditioning for like four days now five
days it really didn't want to miss a
video so here we are I'm filming and
then as soon as I get done I am off and
heading to my friend's house where my
dog currently is and going to use her
air conditioning set at this video but I
wanted to throw that out there because I
feel like I just look like a hot mess
because I truly am mama first off I want
to start with some foundations these
were recently mentioned in my views and
abused and make up tank if you missed
that video I'll have it linked down
below but these are going to be familiar
if you've seen that video because it was
just posted this past week the first one
is the Maybelline butter skin foundation
I have had this foundation for quite
some time
it is pretty much you know a disaster I
mean this is why I was featured in the
used and abused makeup tag and clearly
you can tell it is almost completely
used up so what I categorize the
maybelline butter skin and the buster
worst category of course this is going
in my best category I really enjoy this
foundation it has a lot of good skin and
benefits in there so I find myself
reaching for the foundation a lot when
I'm dealing with any breakouts or
anything like that really believe it
does help my skin
as well it's coffee better skinnet
foundation it doesn't leave a dewy
finish but it doesn't leave a matte
finish it's kind of like been nice
in-between maybe like a satin finish but
I really really enjoy it I apply this
with a brush and the Beauty Blender and
I like them both it does have a pump on
it I mean clearly my foundation is
basically destroyed but it does have a
component which I did appreciate as well
the Maybelline better skin is definitely
one of my favorites and it goes in the
best category another foundation that
was featured in my muse and abuse and
makeup tech is the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi a foundation I bought this one on a
recommendation from Jaclyn hill I
believe it was she was always raving
about this one so I went out to my local
Target and bought it this one I'm in the
shade sand beige the Maybelline a better
skin if you're curious I'm in the shade
nude beige it's kind of hard to get
prices on drugstore foundations because
they are always so very different from
Target to well rinse to CBS to Ulta the
prices are all very different so it's
hard for me to kind of like give a price
but I can go ahead and list my shades if
you guys would be interested in that's
true Match Lumi it is going to be a
luminous finish foundation will give
your skin a glow absolutely love it if
you cannot tell from this bottle that I
have gone through a lot of it I'm going
to be running out very soon which makes
me very sad it also does have to pump on
it which is so great I feel like these
are so handy again I will apply this
with a brush or a Beauty Blender
I reach for this so often it looks
really really nice on the skin it also
does have SPF 20 if you are interested
in having foundation with SPF in it
especially during the summer if you want
to give yourself an extra boost extra
protection this house has the SPF 20 in
it one of my favorite foundations this
would definitely go in the best category
another foundation I have from L'Oreal
is their infallible Pro glow I am in the
shade 207 sand beige in this one so this
guy obviously has the different
packaging than the True Match Lumi or of
the squeeze tube and then that is how
the foundation comes out it is so hot in
my office that it literally just started
coming out by itself so it is so hot in
here you guys it is crazy but this one I
also love this got a lot of hype on
YouTube it eventually I succumb to the
hype and I bought it I believe I got
this one at Target and I was like okay I
get it it does have a bit of a
ultimate if you do not want sense in
your foundations this one does have a
scent to it but I really like it and
again it's the infallible Pro glow so it
is going to give the skin a more glowy
look I do we love to eat a mattifying
foundation you know the last two that I
mentioned are definitely not going to be
for you but I like to have that glowy
luminous look I'm not really oily so I
don't really worry about looking too
oily throughout the day you know now
might be an exception but I love when my
foundations give me a bit of a glow I
just like the way it looks on me does
have SPF 15 it says a radiant finish
which I would agree with that and for
normal for dry skin and it is a
hydrating a foundation again this is
just one of my favorites I can tell from
the squeeze tube that I'm almost out of
this one as well with the L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow I would also put in
the best category so the next foundation
I have is from wet and wild is their
photo focus of foundation this is fairly
new as well from wet and wild and a lot
of people have gone crazy over this
foundation but honestly I do not like it
I do not reach for this foundation I
don't think it does anything for my skin
I don't think it's bad it doesn't like
break up on the skin a lot it doesn't
exercise in these lines or settle into
lines or anything like that but to me it
just doesn't do anything for my skin it
looks flat on my skin when I wear it I
kind of just look at myself in the
mirror like okay like you look fine wait
that's what I think when I wear this
foundation I know a lot of people have
been totally hyped over this guide
unfortunately it just didn't do much for
me I do like the packaging I like the
glass bottle I think that's great the
applicator is a little bit on its a
different side so the applicator looks
like it's almost like a paddle behind in
the shade buff fist but again I wore
this for my review period so I would be
able to give good feedback on the
foundation and whether I think it's
worth or not but since then I just do
not reach for this I don't like it on my
skin I don't think it looks good it does
have a scent to it as well but this one
is just not for me so unfortunately the
wet and wild photo focused foundation it
would have to go in the worst category
for me so next time I have a foundation
from NYX this is the total control drop
foundation this is also fairly newer to
Nick I would say
within the past couple months this has
come out and this was one that I was
truly curious about because I was
interested in the drop foundation so
this is what the applicator looks like
and then the foundation you just drop it
like so you can drop it on your face you
can drop it on your brush you can drop
it on a Beauty Blender and the point of
it is that you're supposed to be able to
control how much your coverage is which
I kind of get with the dress but at the
same time even with foundations with a
pump I'm like if I want a fuller
coverage also more on if I want less
I'll do a less pumps like I don't know I
get the concepts behind it but to me I
when I got it and I started using it I
was like well it's really not that
different to me than a regular pump
foundation so but still an interesting
concept and I enjoyed that next was
doing something a little bit more
innovative I liked it at my shade in
buff I think it's okay but I'm going to
have to classify it in the worst because
I don't reach for at a time and because
it does kind of strange things on the
face it does oxidize so that's something
to know if you're picking out your shade
it will get darker on you throughout the
day but I realize with this foundation
it settles into any lines on my face and
really emphasizes them even lines that
aren't super prominent yet it will go
into those lines like on my forehead and
just show and it just doesn't it just
doesn't look right after time so
unfortunately it's hard for me to reach
for this one sometimes if I just want a
real light coverage foundation like sure
I'll go ahead and put a couple drops on
my Beauty Blender and buff it in but I
can't use this as more of a full
coverage foundation because then it just
cakes up way too much on my face it just
really gets into those lines and just
emphasize those things that I do not
want to be emphasized so unfortunately
the NYX total control drop foundation is
going to have to go in the worst
category for me so the next foundations
I have we're just featured in my makeup
I've changed my mind about video which
I'll have linked down below but these
are the Maybelline fit me foundations I
have the regular fit knees and then I
also do have a matte and poreless I
mentioned in the video that these were
some of the first foundations that I
ever tried and I used to love them and
recently I have changed my mind and I
just cannot get
anymore so unfortunately I am gonna have
to put these in the worst category these
do oxidize really really bad both lines
that I tried they oxidize Oh like crazy
I tried to play around with different
shades different undertones and still
everything pulled so very yellow on me I
was always giving a ton of comments
about how yellow my foundation look and
also they are really heavy on the skin
at the matte and poreless in particular
Venus it's like a medium to full
coverage but it feels very heavy on the
skin and can take up very easily and
just look like you're wearing foundation
if you know what I mean like not in a
good way type of thing but even the
regular line this isn't the dewy one but
they came out with a little bit layer
this is like the original fit means that
I have right here even still they just
feel heavy and kind of look heavy and
just don't look super nice on the skin I
really can only apply these like if I'm
going to wear these which I can't
remember the last time I did I do have
to apply them with a damp Beauty Blender
to try to like bring some sort of
moisture into my skin and to almost like
try to give it a lighter coverage
because they just they just don't look
great on my skin anymore so like I
mentioned and the makeup I've changed my
mind about these used to be like my
writer diet and I think it was because
they really were the first foundation
that I was wearing so I didn't have a
lot to compare them to but now I just
don't reach for these and they would
have to go in at the worst category for
me foundation that I have here from
number 7 is their stay perfect
foundation to mine in the shade cool
beige this is the one that I am
currently using so this is a really
beautiful bottle kinda like the frosted
bottle it does have a pump which i think
is fantastic number seven is a newer
brand to me but oh my gosh I've been so
impressed with them I feel like I keep
mentioning number seven over and over
and over again in video so I think you
guys know how much I'm loving on this
brand but this foundation is so good I
was hearing a ton of people recommend it
I was actually going to buy it went to a
Walgreens and did a bunch of swatches
and then they actually reach out to me
and sent me a couple of the foundations
which I was so appreciative towards
because I love this foundation I highly
recommend it I would definitely put it
in my best category I keep reaching for
it if you watch my Instagram tutorials
you see the number seven stay perfect
foundation in there a lot because it's
just a beautiful foundation so it
is for all skin types it is a medium
covers which I would agree with it's not
too heavy on the skin but it is a solid
medium coverage because that's like my
sweet spot for our foundation coverage I
don't like to light but I do not like
full coverage I don't like heavy on the
skin it says it's good for all-day wear
and it does have SPF 15 in it so again
it can be good for going out in the hot
summer days you will have an extra layer
of SPF on your face because I know that
you use a sunscreen
IFE right they really nice like natural
but better looking foundation on the
skin it's kind of hard for me to
describe but seriously I just think it
looks so good if it lends up so easily I
really enjoy using this with a Beauty
Blender and I just think it looks so
pretty it's definitely a very long wear
foundation as well which I believe is
does say all-day wear on here I do think
it is a very long lasting foundation I
have put this on early in the morning
and then left my house and been gone all
day in the hot Summer Sun and when I
come back it still does look pretty the
only thing that I would say is that
throughout the day like if you wear it
for like six to eight plus hours if you
are oily you might need to powder I'm
not really oily or dry but I noticed
with this foundation after I wear it for
at least more than six hours I can kind
of be getting a little bit on the more
glowy side but a little bit of powder
fixes that right up again one of my
favorite drops our foundations would
highly recommend and I put this in the
best category another foundation I have
here is from Bronx colors it's their
hgtv foundation so this is what the
bottle looks like it's kind of similar
to the wet and wild but a little bit
like skinnier and then it also does have
a pump on it bronze colors can be found
at also they did send me a package to
try out some of their makeup and they
put the foundation in there and
unfortunately it did not work out well
for me this is a foundation that when I
blended it into my skin it kind of just
disappeared it didn't look like I had
foundation on it all but not in a good
way like yes you don't want to look like
you're wearing a ton of foundation and
makeup but at the same time it's
literally just disappeared from my face
I tried it with different Beauty
blenders I tried it with different
makeup brushes just you always want to
make sure that it's not your makeup tool
that is doing it for your foundation but
I did test it out
several different makeup tools and it is
the same thing so I know that it was the
foundation there's just really nothing
to it it just disappears from your face
so I mean I can't even say that my face
looked bad after I put it on it just
didn't look like I had anything on it
was very bizarre I don't think I've ever
had a foundation do that to me
so it was pretty strange but
unfortunately the Front's colors HGTV
foundation is going to be in the worst
category the final foundation that I
want to talk about is my newest
foundation to me this is the covergirl
vitalists healthy elixir this is a new a
foundation from covergirl I recently
just picked it up I have a video testing
a drugstore makeup where I try this and
I put it on in the morning and then I
check back in at night and let you guys
know how it held up I have been wearing
it every single day since making that
video I do have it on today because I
really wanted to include it in this
video and to be able to give some good
feedback but I also do want to say I
have only worn this now four or five
times it's definitely my newest
foundation but from what I can say so
far is that I really really like this
foundation I'm not going to say I love
it yet because I don't feel like I've
been able to put it fully to the test
but I really enjoy this foundation is in
the shade 740 which is a natural beige I
think it looks really nice on my skin
when I did use it in the testing new
drugstore makeup I use an elf Beauty
sponge and I was a little concerned
because I put on what I thought would be
the normal amount of foundation and it
really didn't cover anything it says
it's more of a full coverage foundation
and I was like I can still see a lot of
like imperfections on my face it did not
seem to be a full coverage and then I
tested it out with my sms glam Beauty
sponge and I have also tested it out
with a makeup brush also and the
coverage is there it was definitely the
elf Beauty sponge that was either taking
off the foundation or it was just
absorbing a lot of the foundation so I
used it with other makeup tools found
out that it was the elf sponge that was
doing it and not the foundation in this
case let's go it's always important to
test with different factors as well so
you can actually get a good idea of what
the product is like but since I figured
that out I have been super happy with
this I honestly still wouldn't say that
a full coverage foundation
I think it's more medium to full you can
add more and you can build it up and it
does will look nice but when I put on
like my first layer to me it's a solid
medium medium full coverage foundation
it also has a lot of good stuff and it
has the SPF 28 it has a vitamins and
antioxidant it's also oil-free so I've
really been loving this I think it's
been holding up a really well again it's
been in the 90s and almost be 100 here
in Iowa which is probably why our a/c
broke and again I have been wearing this
throughout the full day in in the heat
and going outside and it's been holding
up really well I think it looks really
nice on the face it almost gives a bit
of like a satin finish to the face I
just think it looks really pretty I've
been a toughie the coverage and I've
been impressed by the long wear of it
I'm going to definitely keep testing it
out but as of right now I know it's
early but I'm going to put in the best
category right now because I really do
like this it does have a scent to it but
it's a nice scent someone mentioned in
my testing new drugstore makeup they
thought it smelled like well I like too
overpowering are like chemical smelling
because that always kind of weirds me
out to say nice light scent but once I
put it on my face it does go away but if
you don't like sense I did want to point
that out but so far yes I think this is
a good one I'm going to keep wearing it
but so far I'm going to put it in the
best category till that is everything
for my best and worth a drugstore
foundation video I really hope that you
