today's video is going to be about the
best and worst youtuber or influencer
collaborations coming through and pulled
out all of my makeup that is from an
influencer and a beauty brand
collaboration I think I pull out
everything I've been planning this video
for like five days now and I keep
stressing that I'm forgetting something
super obvious but I think I've pulled
all my makeup that is in collaboration
with the Beauty Brains in an influencer
and I'm going to be letting you know my
thoughts on them and if I would play
some indie best or worst category if I
would recommend them if they are still
for sale so I have been doing a top 5
best and worse I have the top 5
customers eyeshadow palettes and top 5
best and worst lipsticks on my channel I
can make those videos listed down below
and when I was trying to think of
another top 5 video to do
I just kept finding myself having more
than 5 products to talk about or like I
had 10 in the bust category and 2 in the
worst category I was just really
struggling to put those in a top 5 best
and a top 5 worst so I decided I'm just
going to do best and worst overall on
certain categories as I'm taking it off
with some Beauty influence or
collaborations I always just find
collaborations so interesting and people
seem to really love to talk about them
and give their feedback on them give
their opinions on them so I thought it
could be a fun one to start just a
little bit of a new type of video on my
channel so that you guys enjoy seeing
what I have in my collection for the
beauty influencers or youtuber
collaborations because I always find
it's really interesting to see what
people are buying in the collaborations
and saying maybe like who some what
their favorite beauty influencers are I
am keeping it only to makeup you have
some other items like clothing and nail
polish and things like that that are
from collaborations but I'm keeping this
one just to make up but I hope that you
guys enjoy this type of video before you
go I hope that you will consider
subscribing I do both videos four times
a week so you do get videos from me on
Wednesday which is my wilayat series
Thursday's two Sundays in Mondays so I
hope that you will hit the subscribe
button before you leave so you get
notified for my future videos but why
don't we go ahead and jump into what I
have in my collection from my youtuber
collaborations and my thoughts on them
the first up I have some collaborations
with Carli bybel I have both of her
palettes that she did with BH Cosmetics
the first littler palette
this came out about one year ago I
believe it was so it's the Carly mph
pellet it's a 14 color eyeshadow and
highlight talent so inside you do get a
nice mirror and then you have some eye
shadows and highlight shades this guy I
do still see on the Ulta website for
$14.50 which is just a freaking amazing
price I did hear that this was going to
be discontinued once the new palette
came out but I still see this available
and able to add to cart' at the time
that I'm filming on the Ulta website so
I'll have that listed down below I love
this palette I recommended it so much
I've used it so much the eyeshadow
shades are just so gorgeous and these
two highlight shades I definitely
gravitated towards I love that there was
a mirror her little quote aspire to
inspire which I believe very personally
in I was so super happy with this
palette when Carly said that she was
teaming up with BH again to come out
with the deluxe edition palette I knew I
had to have it also on the uLTA Beauty
website right now for 2250 it should
also still be available at the edge
cosmetics calm and I think it's also
available for nava Beauty calm which is
Carly's like beauty brand Beauty company
so I will have all of those listed down
below but this is what the deluxe
edition palette looks like and it is
gorgeous again you have the mirror you
have the aspire to inspire quote and
then you have all of these gorgeous
shades this one is a 21 color eye shadow
and highlights these colors are freakin
phenomenal I love them I love these to
highlight bars right here and then these
two highlight shades I think are
absolutely stunning this one is so
pretty with like an iridescent shift to
it it's gorgeous I love this palette I
definitely do think this palette is a
step up from the first one the formula
does just seem a little bit better
quality but I love the shade range I
love that we have more shades in this
palette and we have more to work with
and more options to create I do have a
video more recently on this palette I do
have a giveaway but I think it's going
to end the day after this video goes
live so if you do want to win this and
one of the bracelets from pronounced
Beauty which I'm wearing I will need
that video listed down below but I do
have a little bit more in depth video on
this pellet but I have to put both of
these in the back
category I'm just naming busting words
these would definitely both go in the
best category
I love Carli bybel she was the first
person I started watching on YouTube and
I absolutely fell in love with her I
just loved her spirit of like giving
back I love the giveaways that she does
from her subscribers I like aspire to be
able to do that one day to fly out to
meet people or to fly people somewhere
and just create memories of people more
than just like sending boxes of stuff I
would love to be able to create memories
I think that is so amazing that she does
that I love that she's working with like
a charity she has a scholarship for girl
I mean she just does a lot more than
YouTube and she's really as someone who
absolutely does inspire me so I love to
be able to support that but then I also
love these pallets BH Cosmetics is a
very affordable brand and I mean 1450
and 2250 for everything that you're
getting in here I mean it's just amazing
a price amazing quality great brand and
you know a great beauty influencer in my
opinion of course but these definitely
go in the best category some of my
favorite palettes so the next item that
I grabbed out is from I'm sundae beverly
hills it is the Nicole Guerrero glow Kay
I just start watching her right away but
once I did I really connected what
they're expecting like she's just very
like down to earth and very real I got
really excited to see her collaborating
with anasazi Beverly Hills I really
enjoyed the brand and it was on a glow
kit and it was during like my
highlighter crazy days so you got the
six pan highlighter shades you'll see
that obviously one of my shades is
missing because my cloak it did come
shattered as with most of my associate
gloom kits they just can't get to me not
shattered I feel of course has a video
about this palette I bought my
experience and all that fun stuff so
I'll have that listed down below as well
now when I first got this palette and I
did the video I said you know how much I
really enjoyed this palette I really
like the highlight shades I was having a
really good time with them I used them
as highlights and also as eyeshadows I
did that as well I really in particular
loved this forever lint shade because it
was just a very cool like icy blue your
highlight and I thought it was super fun
now that being said after probably I
don't know a week or two of having this
palette I basically put it on my shelf
and forgot about it didn't reach for it
like I just didn't gravitate towards it
after I had it for a while and to me
that says I don't really love a product
sometimes I don't even realize how much
I love a product like it's not something
that I wear and I'm like oh my gosh this
is the most amazing thing ever it's
because of how often I reach for it when
I look at my collection and my eyes hone
in on it I'm like I don't care I for
those three days straight I'm going to
take it out that's how I kind of realize
how I love things it's also how I
realized that I don't really love things
and this is a product that I definitely
changed my mind about because I thought
I was going to absolutely love this and
reach for this all the time when I first
got it and I just really have not I
think it's because the shades are a bit
too glittery like I also really enjoyed
these first two shades which are kitty
cat Forever Young but they are pretty
solidity on me and then these ones are
just a little bit too dark for my skin
tone they didn't really work so really
the only one that I was getting the most
use out of was this forever lit and $40
for one highlight versus six you know
that's getting more expensive and
there's just so many other highlighters
that I like so much more so I honestly
was really surprised and I just really
barely reached for it I can't remember
the last time I wore this palette it
just really didn't interest me all that
much so I'm actually gonna have to put
this in the worst category which
honestly is surprising to me but if I'm
basing it on how much I use it and if I
would repurchase it would I end no I
wouldn't because I'm just not getting a
ton of use out of it this isn't for sale
anymore at the time that I'm filming I
searched for it to see if I could find
it on any of the websites and I couldn't
it got changes if I do find that
somewhere I will leave it listed down
below but most collaborations are
typically very limited edition so I
don't even see that this one is for sale
right now but if it was I honestly
wouldn't recommend it it's just it's too
glittery it didn't work for my skin tone
personally and I just ended up not being
a favorite have some collaborations here
with a Becca cosmetics and jacqueline
hill jaclyn hill again was one of the
very first youtubers that i started
watching she's definitely one of my
favorites I have a Jacqueline Hill made
me buy it video I also have a Carli
bybel made me buy a video I'll leave a
link down below as well in case you want
to check out what some of my favorite
youtubers that made me buy their
collaborations are definitely in there
and for Jaclyn hill hers look Becca
cosmetics definitely is thing that I
bought in collaboration with Jaclyn was
the champagne pop highlighter I can't
open this one because it is completely
shattered which is very sad but I had it
for quite some time before it shattered
so I was happy about that but champagne
pop is definitely one of like my
favorite favorite highlighters I had no
regrets about buy that one so absolutely
loved it
and then I was really excited because I
did buy the champagne glow face palette
in collaboration with Becca and Jaclyn
and it does have champagne pop in there
as well just highlight right here is
champagne pop this is Prosecco pop and
then we have three blush shades up here
this guy was $54 and I was very nervous
to buy it because $54 is very expensive
but honestly this is one of like my
favorite palettes like I am like
ride-or-die for this palette I still
continually reach for the sky so much I
love that champagne pop is in here since
mine is shattered I do enjoy having to
non shattered a champagne pop but I also
love Prosecco pop which is the skull
highlight of these blushes are amazing I
will say this last one which is
Pamplemousse I don't wear as much except
for when I have a desala tan going on
because otherwise it's just a little bit
too bright for me but these two shades
which are in red oh and then Rose I
spritz
I am mmm like oh I love those blushes so
much and again I just will continually
reach for this palette so these
definitely are in the best category for
me a champion Popish is like an absolute
staple staple highlight within this face
palette I just was so so in love with
the face palette
I don't think isn't stack anymore I
think that's been I stock for quite
sometime but I would absolutely put this
in the best category if you haven't
tried it the champagne pop highlight I
believe that you can still get those on
the score website I'll have it listed
down below in the Bekaa website and then
there's all different kinds
now because like champagne pop like
completely blew up so it's in powder
form it's a pro forma than the liquid
form and all these different types of
forms because people really does did
love champagne pop so much so I would
definitely still recommend champagne pop
I would not want to not have champagne
pop in my collection honestly so these
collaborations with Becca and Jacqueline
I definitely put in at the best category
did you have another collaboration here
with Nicole Gerber well it's in
collaboration with I lure so these are
false eyelashes the ones that I picked
up are in one for three
I'll or came out with the vlogger series
I think I had was it four different
influencers and I think each gal did two
different styles of lashes when I went
to my Walgreens to find these I could
only find one for three for Nicole I
couldn't find her more natural style
they weren't in stock at the time so I
just got these one for three I pull out
a lash if you'll be able to see it at
all here they're very different from
what I normally go for I don't know if
you'll be able to tell but they're kind
of short and kind of spiky they're a
little bit more on the edgy side I would
say and I like it it's not something
that I reach for all of the time because
it's not 100% me or what I'm comfortable
with but every once in a while I like to
pull them down and wear those these in
the best category as well there I'll or
which isn't the most affordable at the
drugstore but it's also not like twenty
dollars you know who to lashes or
whatever I think I bought these for like
eight or nine dollars which I don't feel
like is bad and I do reuse my lashes a
lot so I really did like the one for
three I would repurchase them I think
that you can only get them at Walgreens
so I'll leave them illicit down below
and kids chocolate of all grades online
I think while grants and I'll or is the
only place that you could get them but
yeah I would repurchase them again
because like I said I just I just like
that they're a little bit something
different in my collection and they
weren't super pricey so is a youtuber
that I really enjoyed so yeah so one for
three from Nicole and I'll or I would
put in the best category so I have to
talk about is a more recent release and
you guys probably know what category
that's going in this is the Smashbox
cosmetics and Casey Holmes collaboration
and is one of her spotlight talents I
have mine in Pearl I mean I just rave
about this guy I have talked about it
everyone
there I'm always raving about it I
absolutely love these highlight shades
they are some of my absolute favorites I
have it for probably over a month now
and I continually reach for it's one of
those things where like every single day
I swear I start to reach for this
palette and I'm like do something else
like you've already won about four days
this week you have to do something else
I love it I love all three shades which
I feel like is really hard to achieve in
any palette that's probably over three
shades it's hard to enjoy all of them or
have all of the more clear skin tones
checking where all three separately I
can wear all three together I love that
there's a mirror in here it just truly
is an amazing highlight palette I love
that it doesn't show up texture on the
skin because sometimes I do deal with
texture in the areas that I highlight
which is very bad you don't want to
highlight your texture I just love this
formula I was so impressed with this I
love the shades
it was $35 I'm so happy that I got it I
believe this is still available at
Smashbox Sephora and Ulta it might be
available at other retailers as well
anywhere that I can find it I'll have it
linked in the description box but I love
this guy see Holmes is someone who I
absolutely support I think she was very
down to earth and very relatable even
though she has 4 million subscribers I
still feel an actual real friendship
type of connection with her so I was so
excited I was waiting very eerily for
this collaboration to come out with her
eye so it's just super excited to see
this collaboration and then when it came
out as well as it did I was just even
more just so excited for her so yes this
definitely is in the best category I
have a big ole influencer collaboration
with petite Beauty to talk about so they
recently did a pixie pretties
collaboration they teamed up with four
different influencers and each of the
gals put out their own little
collaboration within pixie 60 did send
me the entire collection it was my first
PR package with pixie Beauty well had
that video listed down below but to go
through the collection first up I have
the collaboration with Aspen toe guard
so she came out with this little set is
$16 and included a lower lash mascara
and then also a clear brow hammer or
brow gel now I did like the lower lash
mascara because I wear false lashes so a
lot of times I'll just kind of like prep
my upper lashes but I don't really get
too
with mascara but then I do like to have
the lower lash mascara so I was like I
don't know I kind of get it if you wear
false lashes a lot but there is point
one one fluid ounces of product in here
I felt like I used it four times and
then I was just done it over with and I
don't know about was kinda disappointing
like it was just too small to be able to
really get anything out of and then the
brow famer I just didn't feel like it
did anything I'm not really a huge brow
person anyways but I have a couple of
other different brow gels including the
raised eyebrow from benefit that I feel
like I actually noticed a difference
with it and I didn't really look this
one there is still so much product left
because I just didn't feel like it was
doing anything for me so for sixteen
dollars like this was definitely in the
worst category but she also came out
with blush and highlight these are each
$16 apiece which pixie Beauty chemi-con
at Target is considered an affordable
drugstore brand but it's definitely on
the higher end of the drugstore brand so
16 dollars for like one blush and one
highlight that is expensive but these
are incredible the highlights are so
soft yet so pigmented I can't say enough
good things about these highlights I
think they are amazing I love them both
very much and the blush is so so
stunning this is in Rome Road and it is
absolutely beautiful it's a really
gorgeous pinky peach it has some shimmer
to it I thought it was going to be too
dark on my skin tone it totally is not
the redeemed her part of the
collaboration for me like from these
little guys which I did not like they're
absolutely in the best category for me I
absolutely love them and definitely
recommend this one is in my upstairs
bathroom it's the double cleanse with
Carolyn Perron I think it's how you say
her name is $24 it is I can insert a
picture in here it's like a circular jar
one side is a cleansing oil to remove
your makeup and then one side is a
cleanser to clean your face I absolutely
love products like that where they are
like two-in-ones or something I just
appreciate them so much and it really
did make me reach for that a ton I am
running low on that product and I think
that I will honestly purchased this one
because I love it so much I love the two
and one I think the cleansing oil takes
everything off and the cleanser makes my
skin and feel very very clean
four dollars for two different skin care
products I don't feel like is a bad
price I would definitely put that in the
best category I reach for that sucker so
much next collaboration was with the
influencer it's Judy timing out with two
different palates one was a lip palate
and then one was an eyeshadow palette
these are both $24 and like I said when
I was unboxing the club in Chinese I was
just really underwhelmed with them the
lip palette basically just did not do
anything it did not swatch well I didn't
look good on the lips
it wasn't pigmented at all like all of
the different choices I was trying was
just feeling miserably on my lips this
lip palette like there was just nothing
doing it for $24 I had to go in the
worst category for short and then the
eyeshadow palette like it was okay like
there was a few decent shades in here
but not for $24 morphe pellets way more
and those are $22 for 35 shades and I
know this just fell really really flat
for me like some of the mock shades were
really pretty with the shimmers were
just like super super disappointing to
me I just I would not be able to
recommend this this literally went into
a drawer and I kind of forgot about it
until I was going to do this video to be
really honest with you so unfortunately
the it's duty time collaboration fell
very flat for me I would have to put
both of these in the worst category and
lastly we have collaborations with
Miriam NYC I came out with contour and
highlight palettes and then also a
double-ended brush the brush is $14 I
love this brush I reach for it so much I
love the highlighting side it comes to a
more pointed tip I use that sides to
highlight and I think it's gorgeous this
side I use to contour the most instead
of bronzing because it's more of like a
denser brush and a little bit smaller
like for bronzing I typically will use
bigger brushes this is such a good
contour brush and for $14 to get a
double-ended brush I did not think that
was a bad price this is definitely a
best for me I love it
and then these palettes are Bob for
these palettes so honestly the strokin
sculpt I don't really use as much but
the glow and bronze highlight like a few
of my type of skin tone I would
definitely recommend this one
I love the bronzer
here I wear it so much the sponsor right
here I absolutely love it and then this
highlight shade this gold highlight is
one of my absolute favorite highlights
like ever I definitely like the same
formula as the Aspen Tovar but it is so
freakin gorgeous I reach for this
palette so much for the bronzer and the
highlight shade I absolutely love it so
this was definitely the standout palette
to me out of the two this is definitely
worth the $20 to me I do reach for this
a ton so these would go in the best
category for me as well last influenced
their collaboration I had to talk about
is with kathleenlights and color pop I
do have four different lipsticks here
from her and then also a eyeliner I do
also have a casting light it made me buy
a video I'll leave it listed down below
as well
I love Kathleen lights again she's
someone who just is very like
down-to-earth and relatable to me and so
I just really enjoy watching her videos
I feel like she's always going to give
us truth which I do appreciate
so she's done a few different
collaborations with color pop and this
is what I have from her so first the
eyeliner in mr. Bing it is a very pretty
like warm brown eyeliner I have it on my
waterline today I love it I reach for it
all the time it's such a staple these
are only like five dollars on the collar
pop website I don't know if this one
will be available or not I forgot to
check the color Club Website before
start so Venus but if they are I would
totally repurchase this because again
five dollars for an eyeliner that stays
in the waterline all day and it's super
creamy like I feel like you can't go
wrong with that so I love mr. Bing so
much and then her different lipsticks
that she has here one of them is in
Lumiere 2 which is this guy right here
is a really beautiful like pink purple
like pink deep purple type of shade on
me this one I don't actually love as
much as some of the other ones from her
collaboration are just some of the other
lipsticks in general because it almost
pulled too dark of a purple on me and on
other people it looks way different but
on me I think it's just a little bit too
dark it's definitely a little bit out of
my comfort zone it's still really pretty
I'm glad that I have it it was only like
six dollars so not bad at all she came
out with this trio and I think it was
like last summer I think that she came
out with the trio and so I bought it and
I'm so so happy with it we have November
which is a very beautiful like true pink
and then
which is a really nice everyday light
new pink shade and then point zero which
is probably one of the most unique
lipsticks I have whenever I wear this
people are like are you wearing point
zero because I can tell it's like a
brown grade such a unique color it's so
very cool and pulling it out has
reminded me that I need to worry again
sometimes dude because I really do love
it so her collaborations with color pop
I really do have to put in the best
category not only is it so freakin
affordable five dollars six dollars I
mean you really can't get any better
than that the do really like color pop
as a brand I have a ton from them mostly
because they are very affordable they
come out with a lot of products they do
a lot of different youtuber
collaborations but I think Kathleen is
the only one that I bought from I would
really put these in the best category
some of my favorite lip products right
here and I just love that eyeliner
because I'm going to do it for my best
and worst influencer youtuber collabs I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video or found it helpful let me know
what you think in the comments down
