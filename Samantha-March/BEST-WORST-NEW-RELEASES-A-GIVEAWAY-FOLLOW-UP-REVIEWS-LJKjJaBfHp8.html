today's video is going to be a follow up
and review video so I have two videos
that I need to do follow-ups on both
first impression slash trying to make up
style videos and as always when I'm
trying anything new on camera or hauling
anything I will always come back in a
couple weeks and share my reviews on
everything so I have a lot of reviews
today and then I also have a giveaway in
this video so when we go ahead and get
started already so the first video that
I'm doing a follow up on I did about a
month ago or so and this was a first
impressions video and one of the
products in there that I was trying out
for the first time was from nude sticks
and these are the new DS tinted blur
stick I was quite excited about these I
was really curious about them I like the
original blur stick from milk makeup
especially this week I've been using it
and I feel like so I was very curious
about these they said that you could
wear it under makeup you could wear it
alone it's just supposed to you know
blur out your skin blare out any pores
or imperfections but it's also supposed
to give you a little bit of coverage as
well there's different shades in this
also I wasn't sure if I loved it in that
first impressions video and I know now
that I don't love it which is a bummer
so my thoughts on them so it says here
and by a tinted sheer coverage
lightweight all-over face stick that
blurs texture to have a naturally smooth
hashtag no filter skin okay so I didn't
love wearing this underneath a
foundation I didn't feel like it was
doing my skin any favors I'm you know
there's some ways certain primers that I
lean towards because I feel like they
helps with my skin when you blur out my
blue blur out my pores are just making
my foundation sit nicer last longer on
my skin and I didn't really notice that
with these I felt like some of my
foundations were sitting funny on it I
also noticed that this would pill up on
my skin no matter if I was using my
fingers if I was using a brush I was
noticing it people like pilling up on my
skin like little balls of the product
was do
that so that wasn't great for me so I
also tried to use it just by itself you
know come warmer months here I typically
am going for more of a light coverage
you know I kind of scale back makeup
especially when I know I'm gonna be
outside a lot I don't want anything too
heavy or too cakey on my skin I wear
tinted moisturizers or light coverage
foundations more in the summer sounds
like maybe these will be nice just to
wear by themselves and I also don't love
it by itself I don't really notice much
of anything I little bit of blurring yes
I can tell a difference there's felt
like I didn't really see a lot and I
almost kind of felt like more like I'm
just putting a primer on it was like
yeah I can like maybe a little tiny bit
of a tint but for me like I just need
something more than that you know even
my tinted moisturizers that I wear I
feel like they're just covering more or
just doing more so I just don't really
love these under makeup not with makeup
they're just not my favorite things to
wear these are $30 so they are pretty
pricey as well you know I would rather
pay that much money for a foundation so
these ones were a bit of a mess for me
these were sent to me from milk makeup
to redo but of course I'm always honest
if I don't love something I'll let you
know and unfortunately those ones where
I miss for me I was also trying out a
new foundation in that video this is the
cover FX a power-play a foundation mine
is in the shade P 40 so I bought this
one myself I purchased this Sunday Riley
influenced their foundation and the
latest of Sephora vib sale I didn't love
it I came back and exchanged it for this
guy I was kind of going between the two
the influence there one out
unfortunately but I'm actually very
happy with this a foundation here this
is $44 you do get 1.18 of fluid ounces
of product which is pretty good most
foundations are usually a 1 ounce so you
get just a tiny bit more I really I
really do like this foundation it says
it's a modern matte foundation and so I
wasn't sure I was going to love it
because matte foundations aren't my
absolute favorite must-have go-to
foundations but this one isn't too mad I
still feel like and never looked too
cakey on my skin it never looked look
too much I'm you know you can build it
up to full car
I'd say it's a really good like medium
to full coverage you can build it up to
a full coverage I like using it with a
sponge over a brush because I feel like
it just kind of helps make it it just
kind of like tones down the coverage
just a tiny bit for me because that's my
personal preference with makeup so I
like applying this with a sponge I feel
like it's very long wearing I do have
some transfer issues with this I've
noticed when I wear this sometimes I can
get it like on the clothes I'm wearing
like if I put a different shirt on or
things like that often I'll notice
foundation like around like the hemline
of my shirt which I don't notice with
every other foundation and then
especially if I wear sunglasses the
transport is really really bad right
here which I mean that happens with the
live different foundations but
especially when I wear this one I feel
like when I take my sunglasses off
that's completely worn away and my
sunglasses are full of foundation and I
don't notice that with every foundation
because I do work sunglasses almost
every single day I walk areas on this
every single day and I don't notice it
to be that bad with a lot of other
foundations so this one does transfer
quite a bit I will say I got the shade
p40 and I wish I would have gone like a
shade or two darker I definitely liked
my winter pale shade range at the time
that I was buying this foundation
because it is a little too light for me
right now since I am outside so much I
do you know get a tan in the summer and
it's a little light I wore it the other
day just because I really do like the
coverage I like the way it makes my skin
look it's like a natural matte finish
for me but I was like I'm gonna have to
use a lot of bronzer with this so that's
kind of a bummer but I do like this one
I don't mind the packaging on it it's
not my favorite you have like a little
squeeze tube here and I noticed because
I have used it so much you know trying
to get this review ready I kinda have to
like really shake it when I'm you know
pouring some out so I don't know how I
like that when it comes down to like the
end of this foundation and how it will
be to get out but other than that I
really like the coverage I like the way
it makes my skin look so I'm pretty
happy with this foundation I will be
keeping it so next up here I tried this
new product from Becca cosmetics this is
the Hydra mist set and refresh at powder
this is $38 this one was sent to me from
actally I was really excited to try it
out because I feel like
having some pretty cool things about it
it's a setting powder you can use it
under your under eyes you can use it on
your face I has a bit of a cooling
effect to it which is really quite cool
I don't know if you can see here's what
it looks like so you have this little
cap here and it says keep me close to
keep me cool there's a lot of water in
this product so when you put it on it
almost does feel like it's almost wet
which is pretty cool if you apply it
with a sponge or a brush or whatnot like
it oh this just feels like it's kind of
going on a little bit wet which is
really neat I do really like this powder
I was really impressed with it in that
first impression video and I still
really do like it I'll continue to use
it the only thing that I've noticed that
I don't love about it is that it almost
kind of turns your product a little bit
darker so when I put this on to set on
my under eyes it's almost turning my
concealer under there like a shade and
it's of a shade darker it's not a huge
difference but it's one that I
definitely noticed I like lighter under
eyes I like to use a lighter concealer I
like to use later powders on her they're
the laura mercier secret brightening
powder is one that I really like so when
I noticed it was turning my concealer
darker I was like whoo I actually don't
love that
I don't mind it on my face that doesn't
bother me as much and I don't notice it
as much I don't know maybe it's because
it's not you know such a you know
specific area it's kind of going all
over I don't notice it too badly on the
rest of my face so I'm mostly I'm just
using it now to set my face and I kind
of stay away from the under eyes because
I don't like how it was doing that but
other than that I do like it I feel like
it's that's the makeup really
beautifully I feel like it gives it
really like nice I'm not gonna say like
a super flawless finish a really nice
finish to the skin again it doesn't look
too cakey when I put this powder on so
I've been using this one and to set my
face in a lot of different areas so yeah
I thought this one was pretty good not a
favorite I kind of thought it would be
not a favorite but I do like it so to
finish off that video I was trying a
bunch of different products from Molly
beauty so first up I have their
eyeshadow palette in this guy I believe
was $29 so this is what the palette
looks like you have six different eye
shades in there and then you also have a
contour shade and then also a highlight
and it does come with a mirror I really
like the packaging on all of it the
collection is called the Molly wood
collection and this is the Molly wood
eyeshadow
okay so I don't I don't mind this
eyeshadow palette the quality is pretty
good for the shades but just as I felt
in that first impression video it's kind
of hard for me to come up with a
complete look what these I like all of
the different shades in there loving is
a little bit hard to get the hang of
because it's more of like a pressed
glitter bus to apply with my finger and
I don't love applying things with my
finger but it's it's okay
the shadows are okay the quality is okay
you need to use a spray with some of
these shimmers in here but they're not
the colors that I'm necessarily
gravitating towards at this moment so I
just I wasn't necessarily wowed by the
eyeshadows but I do have to say that the
highlighter in here and also the contour
I have the contour on today I'm actually
really impressed with both of those I
felt like those four really nice shades
the contour is very nice the highlighter
is really really beautiful out of here
so I mean it's just probably gonna
depend I get a little bit of like modern
renaissance vibes over here on the
eyeshadow side they're not bad but it
just they weren't my favorite and I you
know I have one of those mines where I
look at it and I'm like what am I
supposed to do here like I just I get a
little like overwhelmed and confused but
it's not bad but I will say there was
one in there in the collection that I
didn't use on camera that I actually
really do quite like so this is the
Wazza Wazza was up ombre highlighting
trio oh you don't you then okay
so inside it's just a highlighting trio
again you have another mirror and then
you have these three highlights inside
the first one here is actually a cream
and then you have to powder ones as well
I don't love cream highlights so I'm
mostly staying away from that one I just
don't use them a lot but the other two
highlights in here are actually what I
do have on my cheeks today I just
combined the two together and I think
that they are really really pretty so
this guy here actually has me very
impressed I did use it in that video but
I did want to be able to review the
whole collection in this follow up and
this guy was one of the standouts one of
the standouts from that collection so I
really do like
okay and then I also tried the blush in
there so this is their highlighting
blush and I don't fully get these types
of blushes a nice packaging well hello
nice packaging you do have a mirror
there's what the blush looks like um I
just it's not quite my favorite so like
all of these shades are blushes and then
this guy here is kind of more of a
highlighter but I just like I want to
know what my blush is going to look like
going on and you can't really fit a
blush brush into any one of these and
but if you swirl it together you don't
really know what you're getting there
was one time where I tried it and I
swear I swear I put my brush in the
exact same spot and it looked like I had
two different blushes on and I was like
where do you go from here like because
your day just ruined I don't know so
it's just it's not my favorite it's an
interesting concept if you like blushes
like these and you don't mind kind of
like that guessing game I look less
you're gonna get maybe you would like
this one it's very pigmented but it kind
of like worked in the opposite of for me
because I was like ooh now what am I
supposed to do I have all this blush on
my cheeks and they don't match what am I
supposed to do so this one I didn't
quite love either
now the other standout to me is actually
the mascara I have the mascara on today
and I've been really really impressed
with this one so again this is the Molly
smoky mama mascara this one is 20
dollars this mascara is actually really
really good and I get so excited when I
find good mascaras because I'm normally
a lash girl but come summer time again
we're outside a lot we're doing
activities volleyball boating things
like that like I just don't always want
to wear false lashes to all of that so I
need to find good mascaras and this is a
good mascara the wand is super skinny
and it's also super thin you can get
right at the base of your lashes and
really elongate the lashes I think that
these really make your lashes very long
they also make them very dark which i
think is great and they even give a
little bit of volume not like the most
of the luminous lashes you've ever seen
in your life but I love the length that
it gives and this is a one coat mascara
which has me so impressed I can get the
look that I want to achieve with one
coat of this which i think is pretty
awesome so this is another standout from
that Molly
would collection I believe you can also
find these at Ulta as well of all the
links down below like I said yes very
impressed with this one the next video
that I have to follow up for in this
video is one that I did I was trying out
new makeup I also have that one link
down below the first product that I
tried in there it was this guy from milk
makeup and I was so excited about this
this is their watermelon brightening
serum it is $36 so hyped so hyped to get
this because I've been eyeing it I was
curious about it so it's a serum so it's
skin care it's supposed to be
frightening and hydrating and you're
supposed to see results you know after a
couple weeks of use you're supposed to
be able to visibly notice your skin
looking better and I was like yes I'm
here for this
so I filmed the video I used this serum
and I also use the new covergirl
foundation which I'll be reviewing here
in a minute and I broke out terribly I
still have a scar still a scar from that
horrible breakout I was breaking out
along my chin and I was like oh no what
happened here it sounds like well it was
the other of this or this which one was
it and so I stopped using both I let my
skin clear up as best as I could and I
thought it's probably the skincare a lot
of foundations don't make me break out
it's usually skincare that's breaking me
out and so I let my skin clear up and
then I started using this again
immediately broke out immediately and
again like all along my chin area on the
opposite side of where I had a huge
breakout now I got it on the opposite
side and I was like crud so let my skin
clear up again and I was like oh because
I'm fighting to help this so badly that
I love asking clear out I tried it for a
third time and I'm still dealing with
the breakouts especially right over here
by my mouth I also got some of my
forehead this time and I was like okay
it's stopped using it it feels super
cool on the skin like when you put it on
it truly is like you're putting a
regular serum on except it's in a stick
form like I said I love the blur stick
from milk makeup I'm also a big fan of
the hydrating oil stick I use the much
of cleanser I use the toner I like all
of those and I just thought for sure we
were gonna get along so well and I don't
know what it is I don't know
what ingredient in here is not working
out with my skin but it does not work so
of course because it's breaking me out
is it gonna break you up no of course
not I wish I would be able to tell you
the ingredient that's doing it for me
but I really am not positive on that one
but unfortunately it is so I can't
really say that I've seen any you know
great effects from it because I haven't
been able to use it for a prolonged
period of time because my skin reacts so
badly to this one so oh I'm so upset
about that because that's that's a
bummer for me but unfortunately this guy
it does feel really nice on the skin you
know it's easy to use it's convenient
it's travel friendly and all of that but
unfortunately I can't use it anymore
okay so moving on to the foundation so
this is the new one from covergirl the
true blend Matt made foundation I'm sure
you've seen tons of videos about this
one covergirl was really amazing they
sent out a lot of PR kids to bloggers
especially smaller mothers which is
super super cool to see so I'm sure
you've seen a lot of videos about it but
I did want to come back in my review
after I tried it out for the first time
on camera for that video I'm very
impressed with this foundation so I will
say that it's matte made so it is a
matte foundation that is like my only
thing that I don't love about it that my
skin can kind of just look a little bit
like flat for me a little bit dull I
just want it to be a little bit mm more
so I like using this with an oil
underneath an illuminating primer the
new one from covergirl is a nice primer
to use I like to wear a lot of
highlighter when I wear this or I'll use
an illuminating setting spray but this
is one that definitely you know after
I'm gonna say like four or five hours of
wear I feel like my skin starts to look
a little bit dull again so when I'm
using it I would like to wear it if I'm
going to be you know just needing it for
a couple hours at a time or what not and
again that's personal preference for me
if you love matte foundations I do think
that you would really like this one it's
a great medium to full coverage it's
buildable again I like using it with a
sponge versus a brush kind of the same
as the cover FX and my reasonings why
but I feel like the long wear time on it
is good I just don't love it for me
personally and that really matte look
I you know I can't say it's my absolute
favorite-- that would be a lie if I was
putting it in my make up monthly I would
put it in the fine category just based
on my personal preferences is is it
forty different shades of this guy and
it's around nine dollars or so so if you
know it's affordable I'm really liking
this I think it's a really nice
drugstore foundation my the covergirl
healthy vitalists elixir foundation is
still gonna be my favorite because it
gives more of a natural dewy finish
where this one is more like natural
matte but yeah still really good and
this is what I'm gonna be doing for
today's giveaway so I did receive the pr
box which is so amazing I got every
single shade of the full size of
foundations every single shade I do not
need every single shade I will say that
you know I was trying to find my shade
match so I did swatch a few of them out
of there there's a couple that are my
shade match I sent some to friends and
family members so I don't have you know
I'm not just like one shade down for the
box but I still have a lot of shades
that I can put into a giveaway so I did
a similar giveaway like this when NARS
sent me over there their foundations for
the radiant long wear foundation that
they had but they actually sent me a
couple full size and then all of the
shades in like a mini sample size and I
did a giveaway for those these are
actually full-sized foundations that
people are going to be getting which is
pretty cool so there is going to be
eight different winners which is very
exciting
so cover girl has the Foundation's broke
up by light medium tan and dark and I'm
going to basically just be cutting each
one in half so there's going to be two
light winners to medium winners to tan
winners to dark winners okay I will
leave in the description box down below
a list of each of the shades because
like I said some I took some I gave to
friends so it's not just going to be
straight across the board there's either
going to be four or five foundations in
each one again just depending on how
many are left in the box that there will
be eight total winners so make sure to
check the description box I will have a
link in there for the giveaway just like
I always do
I'm you just need to be subscribed to
this YouTube channel I'll have a few
other bonus ones on there but nothing
too crazy and then I'll also have a spot
for you to tell me which one you want
you want like one like two medium one
medium two things and so on and so forth
so I know which ones you
entering floor it will be international
please be 16 or older of parents
permission and again just check down
there I'll leave anything else in there
that I think is important down below or
I will also have it in the generator as
well but make sure to enter through that
generator because the generator will
choose the winners I will email everyone
and then get to work sending out the
giveaway boxes so again eight different
winners I just kind of do it this way
you know maybe you can find one or two
foundations that work for you maybe
you'll mix them maybe you can give them
to someone in your life as well that
would be so awesome but I remember what
the NARS I was like I'm gonna give away
every single one of these samples to
like different people and I was like
that's just not really practical on my
end or on your end like how can you
narrow it down to one or two it would be
hard like I had a little bit of trouble
still getting my exact shape match so
I'm hoping at least the eight winners
fine at least one in there that they can
use so I'm really excited about that so
a huge thank you to covergirl for
sending that to me I'm so excited to be
able to spread the love back so make
sure you get entered other than that
let's keep it rolling with the reviews
boss on that video I tried out this
palette here from morphe this is the 8 L
or 8 loaf I highlight and contour
palette so inside you have 8 different
shades you have more like contour
bronzer shades and then also highlight
shades you do have a nice mirror these
are $25 you can also find them at Ulta
and I have the bronzer on today from the
palette the one in donut I like this
palette I think it's okay again I
wouldn't be able to say it's a favorite
it performs nicely though it's just
nothing that leg blows me away or that
I'm like everybody needs this because
you probably have those bronzers that
you like you probably have those
highlights that you like and the
combination of what's in the 8l I don't
feel like is enough to be like you guys
there's four or five six different
shades in here that are just so
phenomenal like you absolutely have to
go get this palette I just don't feel
that way are they nice yes well I
continue to reach for this sometimes
like it's not gonna be like an absolute
go-to but I do still like it I
especially like the bronzer shades out
of here the highlights are just kind of
okay to me like they're just there okay
like they're good but again just nothing
that gets me super super hyped so do you
need to buy a whole palette where you'll
will
will your singles be good enough and all
of that probably but you know it's $25
for eight shades nice packaging nice
mirror big shades like I said so it's
not super crazy you know pricey or
anything like that but to me it's just
an okay product but next time I tried a
blush from a Kevin of Kwan so these are
the new Neel blushes and there's four
different shades that came out and these
are $38 I believe just $38 so this one
here is in Grapevine which is a rosy
plum which is what I have on my cheeks
today we also have pink sand which I
really do like pink sand this is a soft
dusty pink kind of like my tones and the
one I tried in the video was sunset
which is described as a bright golden
coral I did pass along the fourth one to
a friend this was sent to me in PR as
well as was the morphe if I did not say
that ah sunset I actually really do like
I just wore this the other day as well
and to me it looks like a really
intimidating blush but it's actually
really beautiful as long as you go light
hand it and you don't just like totally
stick your brush and the orange here I
think you can pull it off but there's
this nice kind of like golden
highlighted color as well that you can
either mix in or you can use it as a
highlight I actually really like this
one and I think I'll be wearing it a lot
this summer like I said I do have the
grape vine on today and again I really
do like it I kind of hit my brush right
in the middle here and I think it's
really beautiful it's not as much of
that as a highlight on this end but it's
a nice kind of like transition color you
can kind of hit over here hit the
transition over here and then hit the
middle and it makes it cool or you can
sweep it all together do what you want
to do but I like that you're kind of
getting three different colors in each
of these because it's you know it's
expensive it's $38 but if you kind of
break it down as like well you're kind
of getting three blush it's in there
that one's not you know maybe not as bad
and then the last one here I really like
the Kevyn Aucoin blushes I'm impressed
with the quality of these they're very
pigmented but not like too much I'm not
nervous to use the blush I'm not afraid
I'm gonna be too clownish I do just have
to be a little bit careful with sunset
because that orange is so bright and
orange but if I hit more towards like
right in the middle it's a really
beautiful blush and I see myself wearing
this a lot so I actually really do quite
like these then the last product that I
have to review is an eyeshadow palette
this is from winkie luxe this is the
coffee palette it's $25
inside it looks like this it does not
have a mirror it has these nine very
neutral shades in here obviously it's
called the coffee palette so lots of
neutrals and such this palette was one
when I tried it out in that video I had
tried just a few shades prior to that
and I wasn't super impressed I felt like
there was a lot of fallout but I
actually had a different reaction when I
was trying more of the shades in there
and actually completing a full eye look
I had really good luck with it there's
not a lot of fallout when you are
blending these shadows when you pack on
the shimmers you can get fallout I did
today this is the palette that I have on
my eyes today I used this middle shade
right here as my shimmer and I
definitely had to brush away a lot of
the shimmer but I would just say that's
not a huge negative for me and I would
just do my eyes before I do my face I
actually ended up a really liking this
palette more than I thought I would is
it for everybody do you absolutely have
to have these tones in this palette in
your collection maybe not this for you
to decide I don't know your collection
looks like but I think it's a pretty
good like quality palette I do wish it
had a mirror you know it is $25 which
again it's not super expensive but it's
not to me it's not like super affordable
at the same time but the quality is good
on these the shimmers are good I've
really enjoyed the math I like these two
bronze over here I use them in my crease
today as well I was I was pretty
impressed with this palette it does
smell a lot like coffee a lot if that
bothers you of sense bothers you you
probably want like it's like I can still
smell the coffee aroma right now yeah
I've been enjoying this for a nice
neutral kind of everyday palette before
we wrap up I do have one kind of like
bonus review in here it's not from a
past video but it is this right here
this is from a Saturday skin it is the
waterfowl glacier water cream so I got
this entity from octoly if you aren't
familiar with actually if you're a
blogger it's a really cool site to sign
up with you can basically apply to get
sent certain items from specific brands
and they will send them to you in
exchange for a review so it's a really
cool service I know you do have to have
a minimum like subscriber a follower
account to be able to join actally but I
will definitely link down below if
you're interested in it but it's really
cool to be able to test out certain
proud
it's really neat but you do have a
specific amount of time that you have to
review products so I typically don't
request skincare from them because
sometimes skincare can just take a
little bit of time and to really test
out how it's going for you if you have
any reactions you you need to stop and
start over you know things like that but
this came up on my freestar and I was
like I really want to try it
so I do need to review it you know per
my terms for actally so I thought what
better place to put it in then a review
video so a little little bonus one here
with some skincare it says there's
Alaska glacier glacier water it says it
will protect skin from free bottle free
radicals while promoting optimal
absorption of moisture it says that it
will come and reduce inflammation while
promoting hydration and it also says
that it promotes a skin's natural
regeneration process that can be really
good if you have like texture and stuff
on your skin and this guy is let me tell
you $39 okay so I've been trying this
guy out trying to get a review for it so
the first thing that I notice is that it
really doesn't have a scent like there's
really to me no scent at all to it which
is kind of bizarre this is what it looks
like you need such a small amount of
product that I feel like I have maybe
used it one time just by I mean just by
looking at it it does come up that
little plastic guy that has you know
product on it and I always just used
that guy up first I just stood that away
last night two nights ago because I was
like now I'm gonna get all the product
by one of their you need a very small
amount it's going to go a very long way
it is so lightweight when I put my
finger in this and honestly kind of
feels like you're putting your finger in
water
it's really quite bizarre and when you
put it onto your face it is it's like
you're just splashing your face with
water with like a little bit of like a
gel that you can feel it feels really
cool on the skin it's very very fast
absorbing which is really nice that's
another thing that I definitely noticed
about it and it's almost kind of like a
cooling sensation on the face as well
which I appreciate in the morning
irritate my skin at all I do have
sensitive skin I also do have I would
say like dry to normal skin right now I
am also 31
didn't notice anything was like my
sensitivity with it I definitely have
noticed that my skin has been feeling
more hydrated lately and you know that
could be a cause of putting this one
into my skincare routine I've really
been liking this guy I'm pretty darn
impressive it so I'm really excited that
actally and Saturday Segen decided to
send this over to me so I'm gonna have a
great time keeping this in my collection
but I wanted to add on that little bonus
review but after that then that's gonna
do it for today's video
