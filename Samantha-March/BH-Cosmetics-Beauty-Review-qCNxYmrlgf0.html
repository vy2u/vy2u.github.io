going to be recording a my first Plus
video and it is going to be on makeup I
have reviewed this company on chocolate
plus and I'll link to my written review
in the box here initial plan was doing
some of these makeup reviews is kind of
doing it by company and a lot of times
when I find companies I'm really loyal
to them and I continue to purchase from
them so I have a few companies that I
would love to spotlight and talk about
so I'll kind of go through what products
that I have from them and give my
feedback on them you know even though I
fall in love with a brand or a company
you don't love everything that comes out
for them my first company that I'm going
to be reviewing is BH Cosmetics and when
I first started really getting into
makeup this sounds really strange
probably but I just never knew how to do
makeup as of three years ago according
to my time hop there's a particular
picture from I think was it a three or
four years ago of my girlfriend doing my
makeup in the bathroom for my birthday
because I just didn't know how to do it
I had loved makeup and I loved buying
makeup and I loved trying to put makeup
on but I just really had no idea how to
do it and it always kind of looked weird
on me and what I did it actually my best
friend is a licensed aesthetician and
she did beauty school she does a lot of
things with skincare but she also knows
makeup very well and so she taught me a
few of the tips and tricks that she has
and then I also started watching YouTube
videos I started watching videos of
beauty bloggers and they would do
tutorials and teach how to do makeup and
give their reviews and give their
suggestions on products and now I feel
completely confident in doing makeup you
know it's been a few years now but I
still watch their videos as often as I
can and
learn new techniques and find new
products so that's really what I did and
I'm so happy because I'm such a girly
girl and I've always loved makeup and
now I know what to do with it and now I
understand it so that's kind of like my
little intro so a few years ago once I
decide that like yes I really know what
I'm doing I can actually start to build
up a good collection and I know that
I'll use it might like the first company
I really purchased from was BH Cosmetics
in part because I think they're really
really affordable you can only order
them online they do have products on
Amazon but they have a great website
I really do suggest following them on
like Instagram that's where I follow
them I thought so on Twitter - I believe
but Instagram is where they have all
these sales that always have something
special going on and you can get like
two for one's half off free products I
mean a lot of times they have amazing
deals going on I really wouldn't
probably purchase until they have a deal
going on because you'll purchase and
then I'll be a week later they'll have a
deal and you want to kick yourself
because I've done that so don't do that
so I kind of have a lot of products from
BH so my bought for myself some I've
gotten as a gift of two eyeshadow
palettes and one is the BH party girl
palette and this has 240 shades in it
and then I have another one and it's the
BH day/night pot tell it and it has 60
and inside it has a little mirror I just
tell you guys story so I knew this is
going to be my first beauty video that I
was going to do for you guys that I was
going to touch on BH just this morning
I'm getting ready and I don't know what
happened I went to put one of my
palettes
back on top of another palette and all
four of my palettes all three BH
palettes plus my elf blush palette fell
on the ground I was so upset because I
figured I knew something had broken and
this was one of the palettes that did my
contour palette is much worse but don't
mind I don't know if
can see the mirror but it's yeah I lost
a lot of eye shadows I lost one - mmm 3
H 3 4 I shadow from this morning
that was really sad day but so that's my
that's why these kind of look a little
funky but so the day-night palette it
has 60 colors it's like falling out on
me they're they're not super large but
they're they're not really small I would
say the party-girl palette which has the
40 colors these ones are a little bit
bigger I I don't totally love the
palettes and I got the two I got him at
the same time because they were having
him deal I think it was like buy one
palette get one half off or something
like that so that's what I got - you
really don't need to I shadow palettes
especially with so many colors like what
I I don't reach for them a whole lot
just because I have kind of my go-to
eyeshadows and none are really in here
if you know maybe if you do kind of like
wild makeup a lot and you can use you
know some of these like funner colors
you know like I don't know a lot of
these greens I don't really use greens a
lot don't like this bright red I don't
think I've ever touched that at all but
you know if you like to do fun things
with your makeup and an experiment I
would probably suggest giving one
palette versus two because I just don't
use them enough - okay another thing is
I just don't think they're very
pigmented and when I know that I'm going
to use their eyeshadow and I'm gonna use
it look all over my lid I have to use
like I have mac's fix+ which kind of
it's a liquid that's spray and it helps
bring out the pigments in the eyeshadows
because I just don't think the pigments
really stand out and I kind of have to
put a lot on in order for it to show up
and then it kind of fades throughout the
day so Beach isn't my total favorite for
the eyeshadow palettes I will be talking
about a few other companies
my next videos and they have like
individual eyeshadows that you can get
and you can kind of create your own
palette and that's what I've been doing
lately because I can pick and choose
which color and I can kind of create my
own my own palette on what colors that I
normally wear and I like that route
better than buying like prefilled
palettes you have one other one though
from BH and this one is broken too I
don't throw my stuff I swear I don't
know what happens so I can't open it all
the way but it's the BH Malibu it's the
California makeup palette so it's this
real small palette this was like a free
gift when I ordered I think my makeup
brushes it came with this so that's why
I got it but when you open it up it just
has a few eyeshadows and here's some fun
different colors I don't necessarily use
a lot of these colors a lot like I said
because like the blues and the Greens I
just don't really wear then inside it
has like blush and a bronzer and a
highlighter but I can't open it because
this blush I think it is is just
completely smashed and broken that would
fall out all over me so that's sad this
is a cute I mean it's cute if you get if
these little palettes or ever like in a
get one free I mean get long because
they're fun and they're really easy to
travel with because they're so small
they fit really easily in your makeup
bag but I probably wouldn't purchase one
on its own one other palette and this
one one of my colors is still currently
all over my bathroom floor because I
have yet to clean up the mess it made
which I really need to do because that's
just I mean hello gotta clean up your
mouth girlfriend is the sixth color
palette it's the contour and blush
palette and I got this Oh a little maybe
like a year ago when I started trying to
figure out how to contour and highlight
my face something that I'm still working
on I think I'm getting a little bit
better at it I watch a lot of those
videos
I try to teach me how to do it but I
thought why not get a palette that has
all the colors out there for me and like
I said BH is more affordable so this was
kind of a more affordable one there's
some really good palates out there right
now like a Nastasia i believe has a
palate that everyone raves about and k
Kat Von D is supposed to have a really
good contour palette too
those are so much more pricey so if
you're kind of starting off I would
definitely maybe recommend this one you
guys are gonna laugh when you see it
it's so sad looking but this is what the
inside looks like this is obviously the
one that broke out this is the contour
shade I probably won't even be able to
use it anymore because of what happened
but they have two different blush shades
- to be really honest I really only use
the contour shade to put like in the
hollows of your face and around your
forehead and then under your chin and
then I used the two blush and that's
really about it sometimes I used this
one I was kind of like a stuffing powder
after I did my foundation but as I would
use this one or I have it's another
drugstore product it's just a powder I
think it's from like Rimmel that I used
now to set my concealer under my eye so
really I only use like three products
out of this I might still be able to use
the blush after the catastrophe this
morning of it breaking which is so sad I
did like the contour shade because a lot
of times I just contour of with bronzer
and it's not even like a full contour
I'm kind of like bronzing my face but
putting some of it in the contour spots
but because I don't feel super confident
yet I don't do a whole lot but that was
a shade if I did you know maybe if I was
going out or something I would reach for
the contour shade but oh that's really
sad that that happened so maybe that's a
sign that I should just go get a fancy
palette we'll see I'll let you guys know
brushes from BH and I
have a set I think it's 12 brushes in
this little handy thing my girlfriend
actually got this home read for
Christmas the jar and the rocks and the
brushes as well and I really love these
brushes um I think they're they're great
i them there's a lot of eye product ones
when it's kind of like almost like a
pencil brush I don't know if you can see
that one I use that one all the time
either for just putting eyeshadow on my
lid or a lot of times I'll use it to put
the eyeshadow underneath my eyelid and
kind of blend it in so I use that one a
lot you know there's these like good
fluffy ones for a lot of times I use
this one for studying my foundation all
over my face I'll use like a translucent
powder and I'll use this one this one I
use I kind of go back and forth
sometimes I use it for blush I don't
know if you guys can see that sometimes
they use it for blush sometimes I use it
for bronzer they have this nice little
one sometimes I use this one for
highlighter and I kind of do the
highlighter at my cheekbones I like that
one and then this is also where my
makeup brushes go I really like makeup
brushes it's a kind of a problem but if
you can find a you know on sale or
discount or whatever it's really nice I
have a few more vh1's in here but
they're pretty similar to what I have
from the other one but there's a lot
more just like regular eyeshadow ones
like this one would just be for regular
color this is my favorite brush for
bronzing because it's kind of angled
like this so I can really like get it
into the the contours and favorite
favorite favorite one let me find it in
this hot mess
alright so this is not only my favorite
BH Cosmetics brush
it's like my favorite brush it is one I
use every single time I do my makeup I
use this brush and it's their blending
brush
and it's amazing I love it it's really
thick and fluffy but you guys when I
would see people with like the blended
eyes shadow looks I could not figure out
how they were doing that and I asked my
friend and she said it really the
brushes that you use really does make a
difference and I thought you're lying to
me tell me your real secret and then I
bought this brush and then I thought oh
okay
I get it that really is the truth so I'm
here to say that is the truth
so this brush I use you know I can maybe
go through I don't know someone did ask
me if I would do like makeup tutorials
kind of how I said that I watched but I
probably won't because aI don't think I
have the right camera for it because I
don't even have a camera and this is
being recorded on my phone but I'm not
trained I'm not you know I literally
just learned by watching YouTube videos
and asking my friend that is how I
learned how to do makeup so I don't feel
like I can teach people I feel like I
can give my reviews and my feedback but
teaching and doing tutorials that will
have to be like way in the future if we
ever get there but to just kind of give
you an idea of what I normally do for
eyeshadow as I put a transition color
first in my crease and I use this brush
a transition color is like a lighter
shade that you put on first and it kind
of helps blend everything together so I
use this brush for it and then depending
on what I do next if I'm doing two
colors my favorite combination to do is
my transition color and then a matte
brown and then a red that I have that
I'm sure I will talk about in a video
sometime because it's my favorite
eyeshadow of life but so I will again
I'll come back to this brush I'll put
the brown on it and again I'll put it
right in my crease spray in that
transition color blend them all together
and then after that I take a smaller
brush I have a lot of brushes I take a
smaller breath brush this is the
blending brush as well
this is from Sigma and I'll talk about
Sigma because I have a few of there
as well and I really like them but you
can see the difference between the two
blending brushes you know one is really
thick and fluffy and the other one is a
little bit more defined so I'll use the
BH one when I'm not being precise and I
just want to blend my eyeshadows
together and then I'll go in with my
Sigma when I want to put my final color
right below my crease and then I'll do
that and then I'll come back to the BH
and then I'll blend them all together I
don't know if that makes any sense
because that sounds really complicated
but that's what I do for my eyeshadow
and it works for me really well so that
out of all the products that I talked
about for EM BH Cosmetics that blending
brushes truly my favorite that is
something I would recommend a half in
your collection for sure if you're
interested and in building up your brush
collection or your makeup collection or
you're interested or you're just kind of
trying out and trying to get a feel for
it because BH is more on the inexpensive
side that is a company that I personally
would recommend going with at first you
know that's what I did a few years ago
now I've kind of dabbled in a few other
companies and if you oh they're more not
high-end but more pricier companies and
I can definitely talk about those on
this channel as well but for my first
Beauty video that's kind of a look at
some of the products that I use and then
I have feedback on again I have written
reviews on chiclet plus so I'll post
that in this box so you can see what I
had to say on there I'll also link like
ph's website and their Instagram because
I do think their Instagram is really
good to follow so I'll post those in the
box I hope you enjoyed this video give
me some ideas of other Beauty videos
that you'd want to see or if there's any
companies that you're really interested
in if you're curious that I have and you
feedback to give I could do like a haul
video if I ever go to Ulta or the
drugstore I could kind of come back and
show you guys what I got and if I have
any reviews on any of the products yet
so just kind of let me know if you did
enjoy this video I hope
you'll give it a thumbs up and subscribe
so you don't miss a future video and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
