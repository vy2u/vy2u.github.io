just going to be a short one I just have
an announcement to make it's coming a
few days late but here it is here's my
video and this is why my fourth book up
to i do is now on sale away on wednesday
july twenty ninth i wanted to get this
video up for you that day i did have to
wait to get my print copy in the mail
when you publish with createspace you
order approve copy just so you can look
at it look at the cover look at the
spine look inside make sure everything
looks okay and then you can put your
paperbacks on sale so the ebooks the
release date was July 29 and everything
went out okay but the paperbacks are
usually a little bit behind just because
it takes a while for Amazon to improve
everything and you get everything
uploaded then you have to wait for your
copy to be shipped to you so I really
wanted to be able to show you like the
actual print copy instead of showing you
the e-book on my surface so I had to
wait a little bit to get that in we had
a family emergency and we had to be gone
for a few days as well but when I got
home this was waiting for me on my
doorstep and I was so excited so this is
my fourth book it is called up to i do
it is a chick-lit novel if you like
Chiclets that is what this is it is
about a wealthy heiress Emerson Sinclair
marrying Logan Worthington and basically
the book is up to their I do it leaves
their entire year of engagement up to
when they get married there's a lot of
antics involved there's you know issues
with her sister who's her maid of honor
his brother which is the best man we got
problems going on there we have family
dynamics happening we have a crazy
wedding planner in there and kind of at
the center of it all is Emerson's
grandmother grandma pearl and this book
is dedicated to my grandmother she
passed away six years ago and the
release day July 29th was actually the
six-year anniversary of my grandmother's
death she passed away from breast cancer
but she was one of my best friends she
was someone who both her and my mom you
know my love of books comes from those
two when
and at a very special relationship with
my grandmother so you know to be able to
dedicate a book to her I just thought
was really cool so this one is dedicated
to my grandma and I love the
relationship between Emerson and her
grandma and the book and you know some
reviews have already come in and I think
every single one of them so far has said
they thought the relationship between
these two characters were so was so
touching and that really means a lot to
me because that is like the most special
part of the book to me but Graham's
helps along the way and you know helps
with the wedding plans and kind of keeps
Emerson back on track and Emerson is not
always the most likable character she's
very rich very wealthy she's a bit
spoiled but I hope she redeems herself
in the end for everyone I hope you end
up loving her I loved creating her and I
just had a lot of fun writing this story
I started writing it actually before I
got married and I'll be married two
years in September this book took me a
long time to write because I've never
written chiclet who loves ticlid and I
run a blog called Chiclets plus and I'm
always all about Chiclets I have my
first three books are definitely a lot
more serious women's fiction versus you
know kind of the lighter Beach read
material of Chiclets but I really tried
to keep it light and airy and happy and
fun with this book and I hope you guys
enjoy it there is a big giveaway running

of course this is like my first big
personal announcement that I'm making to
everyone and I'm just so happy and
excited and this is my fourth book but
it gets better every time the feeling is
just amazing when you see something that
you've worked so hard on come together

absolutely incredible so thank you so
much to everyone who has helped me and

this is what keeps me going and keeps me
being able to do this book 5 started and
plot it out and all that good stuff and
I hope hope hope to bring that to you
next year so that is my big news please
please please go get your copy of up to
i do i'm so excited for this book oh and
yes people have asked i believe i've
mentioned it here on youtube but this is
actually my personal wedding photo this
is me and my husband on our wedding day
and the back i don't know if you guys
will be able to see it with the lights
but there's like a real light picture
over the synopsis but this is another
one of our wedding pictures on the back
of the paper back to so yes this is our
wedding picture and some people are kind
of like why would you do that honestly
my biggest reason is that you see stock
photos being reused so much on books and
for a book that was you know so personal
to me you know dedicated to my
grandmother I don't want to see a cover
twin out there and no one else has
rights to my wedding photo but me I know
that I will never see this picture on a
cover of another book so that is why I
chose to use a personal copy of mine I
just really didn't want to see a replica
of my cover out there too if that makes
sense and honestly going forward with
all my books if I can do my own
photography i will just stock photos I
they're so great and I totally get why
people use them I've used them on my
past books but you just kind of see them
being reused a lot and that's just not
what I want so going forward I'll
probably use more of my own photos or
take my own photos for my
covers so yeah because i said i was
going to make this video short please
check out up to i do please check out
the giveaway below and get yourself
entered thank you so much again I am I'm
so appreciative I am so blown away by
everything that has happened this week
and everyone that has helped me with the
release and I'm just so so happy so
grateful so thankful and thank you so
much i love you guys i will see you in
