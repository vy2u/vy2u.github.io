video is going to be a haul follow-up
video so I'm going to be talking about
two items from one of my more recent
hauls it was the haul what's also 21
days beauty and then also some of my
birthday gift I'm going to be touching
on a few of the items that I mentioned
in that hall following up on them and
giving my reviews letting you know what
worked what didn't work and just doing
the follow up I love when Rachel love's
does her haul follow-up videos and talks
about what works for her and what didn't
work for her I get so excited every
single time she does one of these videos
and whenever I see it I click on it
right away because I always been so
excited to hear people's feedback I'm
such a review junkie myself it is why I
love doing reviews so much because I
count on the reviews so much and I love
watching reviews and reading them and I
find them up so completely helpful so
I'll have the haul video link down below
in case you haven't seen that one
I will have that listed in the
description box down below and a movie
touching on a few of the items that I
mentioned in there letting you know
myself so when we go ahead and it get
started so I had a couple of different
makeup mists that I mentioned in that
haul video I purchased those both of
these are from Ulta so during the also
21 days Beauty both of these were on
sale one is from Smashbox and it is the
photo finish primer water now I have
been using this like crazy and like look
at that it looks like I have used
absolutely nothing so I bought this
because everybody has been raving about
it everybody uses it this isn't a new
item by any means but it's like me it's
like almost in that category of like
cult favorite everybody uses that
everybody tries it everybody swears by
it
so I think it was half off the day that
I bought it as a beauty steal I've been
really loving using a makeup mist as
primers lately I just feel like it's
quick easy convenient I don't have to
worry about putting anything on my hand
you know a lot of primers can kind of
have that like slippery or silicone type
of feeling then you have it on your
hands and you need to go wash areas like
this is so easy quick convenient no mess
and I love
I do really like the smell of this guy
as well I've been enjoying that a couple
of the things about this primer that
it's silicone free is alcohol free and
it is oil free all fantastic things I'll
be honest when I say I never feel like I
can really on your percent tell what it
is that is keeping my makeup on all day
is the foundation is a setting powder is
a towel applying its elements I'm in is
that the primer I'm using I feel like I
never really quite know a hundred
percent foreshore but I have been using
this like crazy our weather is slowly
starting to get a little bit warmer here
in Iowa which means I've been able to go
on more walks with my dog and sometimes
I walk with a full D face and just wave
casually to the neighbors that I walk by
with my false eyelashes on and then my
baggy sub pants while I'm walking my dog
so I have been out in the elements quite
a bit more and in the center and a bit
more my makeup seems to be holding up
pretty darn well and I've been using a
lot of different foundations and setting
powders as well and I said I've had no
issues with my makeup going anywhere so
I would say that's a good thing so am I
like completely obsessed with this
primer of water and I absolutely have to
have it like would cry if I lost it
probably not I'm happy that I got it and
I like it especially for the convenience
factor but I have to say that I am happy
that I got it at 50% off because it is
$32 so like $32 for primer is really
really tough for me I mean obviously
you're getting a lot of product there's
3.9 a fluid ounces in here and like I
said I've been using it very frequently
and it looks like I haven't put a dent
in it so this will probably I feel like
last me for a very long time but still
I'm happy that I got it at a discount so
what I recommend it yes do I think you
have to have it no and I'd say if you
can get it at a bit of a cheaper price
that would be a win the other one that I
picked up is the appear miracle mist
they're hydrating spray I noticed as I
was sitting here that it doesn't say
anything about it on the bottle so I've
pulled it up also also website so I can
read to you what it does but I want to
pick this up pur cosmetics is one of my
absolute favorite brands I have
from them but I did not have this mist
and because I'm currently obsessed with
mist I was like obviously I have to have
peers because she's not right if I don't
it was a beauty field during the alta 21
days of beauty it's regularly $18 I
think I got mine for around like nine or
ten or somewhere in that ballpark so
immediately it's like a lot cheaper than
this much come on
so there is that from the Ulta website
so it's a hydrating face braid instantly
moisturize dry tired and stressed skin
with more than a 70 essential vitamins
minerals antioxidants and amino acids
that's pretty cool what do I think about
this spray the first time I used it I
went like this right and I sprayed my
face and I was like oh nothing nothing
happened can you I didn't feel anything
on face so I got a little closer and I
spray my face and I was like is this not
work it's not oh okay yeah well it's
working so I literally got like right
here and sprayed my face this is the
most lightweight miss I have ever tried
I mean it feels like you're putting
nothing on your favorite to the point
where I actually thought oh man
nothing's happening here when I love
that because it's super lightweight but
it's not going to like ruin your makeup
it truly just gives your face a bit of
hydration and a bit of a boost but you
don't have to worry about it moving your
makeup around or you know the men's when
you like it too close needs for your
face and like literally looks like you
have like a liquid spray on your face I
have done that before especially in my
current makeup mist obsession just does
not do that this is super lightweight
but it feels nice on the skin it smells
really good like now my room smells
better after I sprayed that it kind of
has let go sounds like a fruity scent to
it and it does it just gives an
immediate hydration boost eyes I feel
like I've been using this quite a bit I
feel like you can tell a little bit more
from the Smashbox one that I've been
really loving this one and I really have
there was another there was a night
where I left my house I don't know where
I was going so was my
it's a pretty big deal and I had a
little makeup bag with like some
essentials you know eyeliner and
lipstick and concealer and things like
that now at the last minute I was like I
really want to take this along with me
so I threw this in my bag as well so
this one has been a really big hit for
me I would definitely recommend this one
it's not so much like a primer spray
like the smashbox one is so they have
different uses that they're good for but
if you're looking for a good hydrating
spray a good boost after you've done
your makeup or you need a little bit of
a ledge like halfway through your makeup
day or you're going to be out all day
and you know that you're going to need a
bit of help a couple hours down the road
i would highly recommend the pure
miracle mist i have been really excited
to talk about this one because since i
picked it up i have not been able to
stop using it it is the smashbox and
casey holmes spotlight collaboration i
picked up her spotlight highlight
palette in the pearl shade and oh my
gosh this is truly an amazing highlight
palette i have it on right now right now
if you can tell and have it the first
two shades on today yeah this is a great
palette i knew i wanted to buy it and
really the main reason why i wanted to
get it is because I'm a huge fan of
Casey Holmes I was very anxious to be
able to support one of my favorite
youtubers I'm totally back on the
highlight train I've been wearing
highlight a ton I mean like every single
time I'm doing my makeup not only am i
doing at highlight but I'm like I want
to glow like that is what I want my
highlight game to be these days and even
though when Casey's palette came out is
coming out at the same time that
everybody every makeup brand was
releasing a highlight I was like I don't
care I still want that palette and I am
so so happy I got it when I first opened
it up after I bought it from Ulta I was
a little like I don't want to say I was
disappointed but I was like oh okay
because I had just recently opened out
the anasazi and Nicole palette and that
was like blinding in your face like
there are those highlights and when you
open this one up
this last shade does have a little bit
of glitter to it so that one is you know
kind of like that Blindy shiny one but
the other two I was like mmm
are those going to be high lady enough
for me are they I mean yes yes they are
they're beautiful I've worn every single
shade a lot of times I like to mix the
shade this shade was one that I was like
I don't know if I'm going to get along
with it because it's a real pale pearl
type of shade I would say in the Pearl
palette I was like I don't know and that
is like the best shade I love to use
that shade to top over anything the
other day I wore the Marc Jacobs
spotlight it's a cream highlight and I
was like you know what usually that's
enough for me but no I'm going in and I
grabbed the first shade from this
palette and put it over it because I was
like I love this palette I have not been
able to put it down a fantastic
highlight palette love Katie Holmes but
she did amazing amazing job on her
collaboration with Smashbox there is
another palette is the gold palette has
three separate shades and they're
probably better for those with a darker
skin tone if you're in my skin tone I
think you would really get along with
the pearl but both of them look
absolutely beautiful and I would highly
recommend it this is a big big favorite
of mine I had the last of three I just
going to be talking about our eyeshadow
palette I'm so excited about I know
these are usually everybody's favorite
I'm totally in the eyeshadow palette
junkie club thank you guys so much for
all of you who snapped me a comment it
and let me know I am a part of the club
I made it I'm getting some sort of like
card in the mail maybe it comes with an
eyeshadow palette I'm not really sure
yet I don't know who runs the club but
I'm in it so so the first palette that I
want to talk about is from a violet vos
and it is the holy grail I shadow
palette I have to give a huge thank you
to my beautiful friend Michelle because
she actually sent this to me she knew
how bad I wanted it and how much I was
contemplating getting it and she smacked
me and said girl I just picked it up for
you and I said I love you I'm pretty
sure that's what I said back so a huge
thank you to Michelle you know I love
you so much girl we talk like every
single day on snapchat not like every
single day we talk every single day on
snapchat I was so thrilled when she sent
me the Holy Grail palette because I had
never tried an eyeshadow palette from
violet sauce they have been on my radar
for so long and I have to say that this
palette did not disappoint me at all
this is what's inside the palette
looks like you have a giant mirror right
there an amazing mirror and then you
have all these wonderful beautiful
gorgeous shades here is a close-up of
the inside shadow shades so this palette
is $45 and you get 20 different shades
there's a mixture of matte shimmers
those the lighter shades transition
shades there's beautiful shimmer shades
there's darker shades there's really
dark shades the fun pops of color when I
first opened this I was like how look I
had no idea there are so many different
color combinations that I wanted to play
with I have used this eyeshadow palette
three different times now and I do also
have it on my eyes today I do have a
couple of Instagram tutorials using this
palette I know for sure one is
absolutely but link down below I'm not
sure I just filmed this tutorial today
if it's not up it will be up soon I
supposed to make up tutorial almost
every single day on my Instagram so if
you're not following me over there and
March Beauty word I do face makeup
tutorials eye makeup tutorials getting
ready like makeup prep videos skincare
videos get on ready with my videos I
post a video every single day usually so
you can find all of my tutorials over
there because I know I don't do a lot on
YouTube but today I just wanted a really
like brown smokey eye if matte look I've
been doing a ton of a shimmer slightly
sounds like I just wanted all matte
Brown look and this palette totally
could give it to me but the shimmers are
beautiful I've used some of these really
fun like more burgundy colors down in
this corner over here and they are
gorgeous I have been so impressed with
this palette all of the shades I've used
so far are gorgeous super pigmented easy
to work with easy to blend I've been
very happy there's not a lot of fallout
with this palette which made me super
super happy and I just I think it's
gorgeous the mirror is such like such a
giant mirror and it's so clear this
palette this palette is a palette that
just like speaks for me I'm so so
completely thrilled that I haven't a
huge thank you to Michelle this palette
I would say is definitely worth it I
think if I were to have bought this
palette for myself kind of one thing
that I always try to think about is you
know something is sent to me or a brand
sends me something is it something that
I would return like would I be super and
happy with it I want my money back I'd
want to return it there is no way I
would even consider returning this
palette this has me sold on violet box
I would definitely purchase more
eyeshadow palettes from them that was
kind of one thing that was holding me
back I'd never purchased on the brand I
didn't know you know what if the shadows
aren't good yeah this has me sold on
violet sauce if you haven't got the holy
grail yet at the time that I'm filming
it is still in stock I know that it goes
out of stock pretty frequently so this
one is still on stock I had to say
totally recommended totally recommend it
thank you so much Michelle I love this
palette so next up I want to talk on a
package that was sent to me from my
lovely friend and KCB she is also a
fellow youtuber so I'll have her
treatment link down below to tell me
such an incredible box going through it
was like with like Christmas time all
over again it was so very cool but one
thing I was super super excited that she
sent me was color pop their new pressed
eyeshadows because I had never tried
these before and I was very curious
about it and I've been hearing really
fantastic things about these new color
pop shadows typically color pop so far
has just put out the super shock
eyeshadows which I have a lot of which
come in these little containers and then
look like this so when they release the
pressed powder say it looked more like
the makeup geek which they're just like
the single pan type of shadow and they
are five dollars each they have some of
these palettes where you can get them
with four shapes inside and it's 18
dollars so I'll have the colour-pop
website listed down below I was super
curious to try these but I talk about
colors helped a lot in my will i buy it
videos because i say that sometimes
color pop can overwhelm me because they
put out so much they release at such a
fast rate that it's to the point where
I'm like I don't even want to bother to
keep up because there's just no way that
I can they are always coming out with
new releases so sometimes I get really
into color popping and buying a lot for
them and then other times I scale way
back and I'm like no I don't need
anything and I'm kind of in that latter
category right now where I'm like now I
just only anything color pods are too
overwhelming but it definitely was very
curious about the pressed eyeshadows
especially when I started seeing more
review videos coming out people saying
how amazing they were so Casey sent
along this palette and then the shades
here's a close-up of the shades so we
have save it for later
Sauvage on centerfold and then top notch
is the left shade yeah yeah they're
really good I have used these two or
three different times I use them to
create a full look I used all four
shadows I believe cinnamon instagram
tutorial running on that so I'll have
that link down below in case when I
check it out I've used some of the
shades I'm just in other looks as well
and they are really really good every
all four shades in here that I got are
fantastic super pigmented show up so
well blend easily not a lot of Sallah I
mean basically is everything that you
want in an eyeshadow this sold me on the
color pop pressed eyeshadows I will be
purchasing color pop pressed eyeshadows
now because of these so Thank You Casey
that's your fault Cara may be very happy
because otherwise I think I would have
you know probably purchased the color
taupe single eyeshadows like maybe
sometime down the road but now I've
actually have quite a few like does
anybody else have like running makeup
with because I do I have a bunch of the
color pop shadows on my makeup list for
the next time that I check out with a
color pop I have a handful of they're
pressed eyeshadows on there because I
want to make more and I think these are
the ones these are these two palettes
where you can take this out and you can
create like a V palette and you can put
like ten or twelve different eyeshadows
in there
I think Casey was the one who actually
told me about that the color pop pressed
eyeshadows I would have to have
recommend like seriously if you even
tried some of you guys give them a try I
think you'll be very impressed so the
last I shadow palette and that I want to
talk about is from Tarte this is the
makes believe in yourself I and cheek
palette this listen to me from my lovely
friend
we sorta she was another one that sent
me an amazing box I had so much fun
going through it and I shared a lot of
what she sent and at that hall video and
I just was I was so thrilled
what's the generosity and when I saw
this paladin there because this was a
very very new palette to tart I was just
so overwhelmed and I could not wait to
play with it now I do have a youtube
video using this palette it was in my
testing new makeup so I'll have that
linked it down below I was putting to
work a lot of the makeup that I got in
that hall and also just some new makeup
that I picked up here and there I was
actually applying everything to my face
so it's kind of like a makeup tutorial
but more like chill laid-back we're just
kind of trying things out together type
of thing so I'll have that video listed
down below but I did use this palette
and I have to say I loved the look that
I created I know a lot of these guys
said that you loved it - it was super
like mermaid does the mermaids eyes or
what I was going for in a lot of you
said you felt in her my vibes but I
thought it was fantastic and I was kind
of nervous about it so I said in the
video I've been hearing some mixed
feedback on this palette some people are
saying it wasn't super pigmented in the
fall it was just so bad the shades that
I used I had very little issue was the
only one that gave me a lot of Fallout
was this trans shade right there that
was the only one that I had issues with
fall out with and it was not bad like I
saw a Beverly Hills shadows have way
more fallout and the star pelleted so I
was super impressed this is such a fun
palette now this palette is not going to
be for everybody definitely because out
of all of the shades in here there is
only one matte shade there's only one
all the other ones are shimmers some of
them are more subtle shimmers and then
some of them are more like foiled
shadows so if you do not create a lot of
shimmer looks or you don't like colorful
looks like this how it's definitely not
going to be for you but if you don't
have anything like this in your
collection and you want it you love the
bright colorful mermaid unicorn shimmery
look I feel like you have to have this
palette because it was so good and it
was so much fun to play with and I
thought the packaging was super cute in
here I love that there's the mirror it's
yeah this is another one that I was
definitely reckon
and I had so much fun playing it with it
in my testing new makeup video
lots of look that I created I'm excited
to keep playing with it and keep coming
up with more fun colorful looks the
Tarte palette it is $40 again I would
just pay attention for if you need it if
you think about you'll reach for is
enough and if those answers are yes I
definitely say you need to go for it I
guess so that's going to be everything
for my haul follow-up video and my
