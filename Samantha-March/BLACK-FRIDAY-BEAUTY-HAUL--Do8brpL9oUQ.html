excited for today's video because it's
going to be a new halva do this is gonna
be the items that I picked up doing but
Friday Cyber Monday
but for Black Friday because the deals
were already happening after Cyber
Monday because the deals were still
happening it's just gonna be a good old
fashioned makeup haul today so I'm
excited to show you everything that I
have picked up recently so if you'd like
to see a new hall from me why don't we
go ahead and get started so the first
order I placed was from KL polish and I
had actually mentioned her lips and tips
collection in a wilayat video and I was
said I said it I said I'm waiting until
Black Friday because I think she is
gonna do some sort of special there will
be some sort of deal I'm going to wait
and then it was a few days before Black
Friday the website was having 30% off
and I was like is it going to be better
than 30% off are the shades I want I'm
going to sell out at the 30% off do I
just get it now and I just went ahead
and did it because you know what I was
scared I was scared my shades were gonna
sell out and I wanted these polish
colors real bad so I was still happy
with the 30% off I also signed up for
the newsletter and got an extra 10% off
always and I got three new nail polishes
from Kayla polish which I am very
excited about
I have Aquarius on my nails right now
it's what I've had on my nails the past
like week or so very excited for that
next up I do want to paint them Lumiere
this was the other shade I've mentioned
in my will i buy it video and then I
really wanted to pick up its like
similar to Aquarius but I think it's a
little bit more you know you can see
they're they're definitely different
there this one looks a little bit more
like pink or mauve pink so that is what
I want to paint my nails next and then I
also picked up Prince Cornelius this was
from the Fall collection I want to say
it was and I really wanted to get this
one but I wanted to get it with Chloe I
think it's called which was the olive
shade and I think that one is still sold
out because I wanted to purchase it when
I placed this order and it was sold out
but at least Prince Cornelius was back
so I was able to get all three for like
five dollars and sixty cents or
something like that a piece and then I
have free shipping and then I had 10%
off from joining the newsletter so I was
like you know what I feel like that was
a win in my book and I got to be fairly
quickly as well so yeah I'm excited to
have some more kale polishes next up I
place an order with color
and I can't remember for sure if this
was on Black Friday or right before
Black Friday but they were having a
special on pallets and also liquid
lipsticks for discount it and I was like
I'm gonna go ahead and do it so I picked
up the all I see is magic palette I have
been wearing this you've been seeing me
wear it in my videos I always list and
link out all of my makeup that I'm
wearing in my videos down below and has
been a lot of all I see is magic I will
have a tutorial going up from my video
from the eight brands I think you should
try in 2018 that look is with this
palette and I did film it for Instagram
I have been trying it out because I want
to do a haul follow up video and be able
to review all of these products but I've
been trying this one out so I can review
it here shortly this was $20 and I want
to say they were having a sale with like
palettes for like 40% offer something
like that I thought it was a good deal
so I picked one up and I am very excited
to have it so far so good I've been
really liking all the shades also they
were having their liquid lipsticks were
gonna be on sale for $4 and I know I've
said it many times
colour-pop ultra mats are not my
favorites and even the alter saken's are
not totally my favorites but I really
really wanted this liquid lipstick and I
kept talking myself out of it and then
finally when it was $4 I was like just
get it for the $4 like you've know you
want it and is actually the shade that
I'm wearing today it is Arriba and it
was in collaboration with I love Sarah
II every time I have seen someone
wearing a red lipstick I'm like oh my
gosh that shade is so beautiful what are
they wearing and then they're like oh if
you're wondering what's on my list
it's every bad and I'm like of course it
is of course it is so when it was
discounted from the $6 to the $4 I was
like just get it even though I don't
think that these liquid lipsticks last a
little longer like I feel like they
actually go bad and formula pretty
quickly but I was like $4 you just got
to do it every time I see someone
wearing it I get so completely jealous
so again that is what is on my lips
right now I love the color I think it's
such a stunning red and so far I mean I
literally just put it on but so far I
don't regret it because I think the
color is so beautiful so I also picked
that up with the palette and then the
other item I picked up from that color
pop order was there no filter concealer
a lot of people have been asking me
about this concealer if I was going
to try it out I actually have tried to
purchase it a while back whenever I was
making a color pop order and they were
sold out of almost every single shade I
was like okay
and so I've been seeing more and more
people talk about it and I was like I
need to give it a try
most times with concealers I am in light
neutral like the Urban Decay The Naked
skin concealer the Urban Decay all
nighter concealer which is what I have
on today I'm in like neutral a lot of my
other concealers feature the shades like
neutral so I decided to get light
neutral and unfortunately this is about
three shades too light for me I was like
oh okay that's not good like when I got
it and pulled it out I was like ooh um
mm I don't know if that's gonna be good
and then I started to put it on my face
I was like crap that's not good that's
not good and I was so I was kind of
nervous before I think was my Sephora
vib sale ha follow-up video I was like I
feel like I look so ghostly I tried my
best to like be matching everything on
my skin but I was like I still feel like
you can tell my concealer is way too
light for me so I don't know if I should
try to get a different shade it was only
six dollars I might keep it - I like
lighter under eyes and all of that I
might keep it to mix with other
concealers and that sort of thing but
unfortunately it is way way it's not
even like a shade too light for me it's
s-series I like three shades too light
for me so I'm pretty bummed about that
so just make note of that because
typically light neutral is my shading
concealer but not with this one so I'm
bummed because I don't really know how
to review it it seemed like it was fine
and it blended out easily but I was too
concerned with the color matching so I
don't know well I'll do my best and see
if I can come up with a review for this
guy but unfortunately it was too light
but that is everything that I placed
with my first first thought about border
and then I made some purchases from Ulta
I'm trying to think of the specials that
they were having on I think maybe they
had double cash back at Ebates was one
of their special so I don't just buy
things but you saw these guys recently
put to the test in my first impression
Friday video trying new drugstore makeup
I picked up the Maybelline 24 hours
superstay Foundation and also the
Maybelline total temptation
brow definer so I will list my video
down below so you can see me applying
these and I do actually have them both
on my skin today I will say when I was
getting ready this morning I had a
sweatshirt on because it's like freezing
here in Iowa right now I was wearing a
sweatshirt so I was trying to bring the
foundation onto my neck but the
sweatshirt was so high I felt like I
missed a few spots so I don't know if my
face in my neck matches the bus I'm kind
of looking at myself in the viewfinder
like do I match girl or no but I feel
like the foundation kind of oxidizes as
well I felt like it's definitely gotten
darker because I did my makeup this
morning at probably 10 o'clock and I'm
filming at about 2:30 and I feel like it
just has gotten darker throughout the
day so that is something that I noticed
but so far I've only worn it two times
so far I will be doing an update video
of course but so far so good I really do
like it it's a very very full coverage
but I like it and I mean it's too early
to say I love it and it's odd for me to
say I love a brow pencil but I am really
really liking the Maybelline total
temptation brow definer really easy to
use I like how my brows look afterwards
I even like the color I was a little
concerned blonde would be too light for
me but I like the color and I just felt
like it was really easy and really quick
to get my brows done so again I have it
in my brows today so you guys can be the
judge but yea so far these are going
pretty well for me so from Ulta I picked
up a few lipsticks coz what why wouldn't
I and they they're all from dose of
colors so I picked up a dose of colors
lip it up satin lipstick this is one of
their Black Friday deals it was on sale
for $10 I want to say maybe it's
regularly like 15 I don't quite remember
what it was on sale for 10 and I was
like okay I'm gonna do it this is a
regular lipstick and I got mine in the
shade mocha I was wearing it in a video
recently like I couldn't wait I got it
in the mail and just had to try it this
is what it looks like the only thing I'm
kind of concerned with is that it's it's
pushed up like you don't have to push it
up it's already pushed up so I'm afraid
I'm gonna like break it off or something
so hopefully I don't but I love the
color I thought it was really beautiful
a very creamy really nice looking I was
wearing it in my
make up monthly I'm pretty sure is the
one that I was wearing it in and so far
so good
this is it's gorgeous I just hope that I
don't break it off and then the other
lip set that I purchased from dose of
colors is the Snuggle is the real set
and I was shocked because when I went to
order this the red set was sold out and
it was what I hit first cuz I was
actually gonna purchase that for a
giveaway and I went to the Reds first
Mets that sold out and I was like
there's no way the nudes are gonna be in
stock then but they were true I was
totally surprised maybe red Holliday
more people were buying the Reds I don't
know but I was still you guys I had that
moment where I was like no no I wanted
this so bad I've just been waiting for
the deals I've been waiting for the
deals but I did get the Snuggle is real
set I say this wise was at $29 and you
get three full-size of the dose of
colors a liquid lipsticks and I love the
dose of liquid lipsticks they're some of
my favorites so the three shades that it
came in where I could go ahead and
swatch these out
I always forget to swatch because I am
the best youtuber there is but here this
is mocha so that was the lipid up in
mocha so a nice Brown there and then the
three shades here this one is called
let's cuddle love it that one is let's
cuddle so that one is a nude Brown looks
like it has some peachy tones to it this
next one is called lazy Daisy so there
is lazy Daisy so that one is kind of
looks kind of cool tone like a cool tone
mauve and then this last one here is
called warm and fuzzy and I was actually
wearing this one in my most recent a
will i buy it video I got this set in
and I was like I have to I have to wear
a lipstick for sure and this one was
more of kind of a deeper pink like kind
of like a dusty rose type of pink I
would say so there are these swatches
from the dose of colors lipsticks that I
picked up but I was just so excited I
I've been eyeing this set for a long
time I put it in a will I buy a video I
said I was gonna buy it I was just
waiting for the deals and glad they did
not sell out and then the last item that
I picked up from that Ulta order was a
pair of new lash
pumped because the pure lashes have been
sold out on the author website for so
long and I've just been eyeing them and
eyeing them and waiting and waiting for
them to come back and finally they did
so I picked up these style bombshell I
also really loved the diva lashes but I
legit have like three or four pairs on
backup for this I really love the
bombshell lashes again I was wearing
them in my 8 brands you should try in
2018 and they're like on their last leg
I kind of warm yesterday as like a
farewell party for them because I knew
that these guys were coming in and so
that pair can can be put to rest now got
my new bombshell lashes pure lashes are
some of my absolute favorites I highly
recommend them they are $14 which is not
the most expensive for lashes but it's
also not the cheapest it's kind of right
in the middle there but honestly I feel
like the bands are so easy to work with
and just some of my absolute favorite
lashes I was so glad to see them back in
stock on the Ulta website so got me a
new pair of bombshell lashes alright we
are almost done I feel like I'm talking
so fast trying to get this done but I'm
filming much later in the deck so I was
actually doing its Thomas of work at an
elementary school so I'm trying to get
through this before we lose the sunshine
at you know 3 o'clock in the afternoon
these days but this is an item that I
purchased from Sephora they were having
eight percent cash back this is the only
thing that I picked up for myself I've
been working on it really big giveaway
that is coming very very soon so stay
tuned so I definitely wanted to take
advantage of any of the specials the
deals the you know extra cash back
anything like that because when I'm
doing all of the purchasing for a
giveaway it can become real expensive
real fast so I have a lot coming up and
it's been really exciting getting the
orders in but the one item that I picked
out for myself was one that I've
mentioned in a will about video I said I
wanted to get it finally got it this is
the Urban Decay afterglow highlight
palette alrighty so this is what the
palette looks like I'm so excited and
then you have four shades inside so
those are what the highlighters look
like I will go ahead and do some
swatches because I will remember to do
them here do you have a wicked on today
so here are the swatches from that
palette go ahead and swatch them out I
have been raving about the
decay highlighter in sin whoa no angel
would know angel is really really pretty
I need to try that one for sure so we
have ons and then cliche wicked and then
no angel so those are the highlight
shades
I've been raving about the Urban Decay
sin highlight I used it in my trying
subscribers favorite makeup video
because so many people recommended that
highlight is the first one from urban
decay that I tried and I was blown away
so when I saw them coming out they knew
highlight palette I believe this was in
the $30 range $34 I want to say I was
like I have to get it so again I have a
wicked on my cheeks today so far I've
only tried two of the highlights on my
cheeks but I'll definitely be trying for
and so far so good so happy to have this
fine line already and then my final
items are once again from colour-pop I
was talking about this in my most recent
will I buy a video when I talked about
the new kathleenlights collaboration and
I said that I needed to buy it and I was
kind of bummed for myself because I just
purchased the all I see is magic palette
and I said if Kathleen would have come
out first I said I want to purchase that
and not the all I see is magic but I
didn't know that those collab was coming
up I'd want the eye shadow palette as
badly as I did when I saw the swatches
but I did go ahead and pick up the dream
Street shadow palette and it just came I
actually was not planning on filming
this video today because I didn't think
this was showing up for another day and
then it was in my mailbox so I was like
hey let's go ahead and film this holic
so I know I've been getting asked where
is my haul at and I've just been waiting
on this last package this technically
wasn't a part of Black Friday but I
figured since I knew it was coming you
know I would just wait so I could haul
it here but yeah I haven't even opened
it yet yay all the shadows look good so
here is what the dream Street palette
looks like this was sixteen dollars and
it definitely looks beautiful let me
know do you want to see what what do you
want to say do you want to see a get
ready with me with this palette of first
impressions with this palette do you
just want to see my review with this
palette I mean you just go ahead and let
me know but yep I did get dream Street
it was the only thing that I got from
the club I did talk myself out of the
lipsticks especially because I just
bought a Reba
so I did talk myself out of it but then
I bought an
product because why not I think I was
trying to hit free shipping I can't
quite remember my reasoning but I picked
up their precision brow pencil and then
as I was going to purchase it they had a
different brow pencil too and I was like
I don't know if I'm purchasing the right
one that everyone says that they like
but I looked at the two of them and I
thought that this was like kind of more
what I would prefer so he had the
colour-pop brow pencil and I purchased
mine in dope dope I have no idea of the
shade I'm like really bad at picking out
eyebrow shades so I don't know hopefully
it's not too dark really hard to twist
up here's what it looks like I will go
ahead and give it a try I mean hey I
can't can't judge anything until I give
it a try but you can't I'm glad I didn't
push it up too far because you can't
doesn't look like you can look like you
can make it go back to or maybe you can
no oh no I'm just unscrewing the other
end Wow okay it's gonna put this brow
pencil down before someone gets hurt
Oh something to remember don't push it
up all the way because you can't put it
back to home or if I'm wrong
let me know but just got this it just
opened it but I feel like a lot of
people talk about that brow pencil too
it's mentioned recently in Friday's
video that I'm trying to expand my brow
collection and try different brow
products and just kind of get outside of
my comfort zone so so I got the new
Maybelline one and now I got another new
affordable one so I'll try out the color
pop and see how I get along with it but
after dream Street and then the brow
pencil that is going in to be it for a
buffer to help a guy that does
everything for my Black Friday Cyber
Monday basically just my most recent and
mega Pollock I hope that you enjoyed it
seeing the hall and everything that I've
picked up recently now if there's
anything in here that you would want to
see and like an upcoming get ready with
me video that I could use and of course
in probably about two weeks or so I will
come back and do a haul update and let
you guys know about all the products
that I hauled what I thought of them if
I'm going to return anything what didn't
work out for me anything like that so
that will be coming in the next couple
weeks here but I hope you guys enjoyed
