today's video is going to be my Black
Friday haul follow-up video so it's
about two or three weeks ago I shared my
Black Friday haul and all the purchases
that I had made around Black Friday
Cyber Monday time I will have that video
linked down below and as always with my
house I like to come back after a couple
weeks and just review all the products
let you know what worked out for me
maybe what didn't work out for me and
that sort of thing so today's video is
just gonna be a bunch of reviews on the
products that I purchased recently so if
you would like to see some of my
thoughts on these new items a what might
go ahead and get started
alright so I'm gonna go in the same
order that I hauled everything in the
video so first up I hauled a couple
items from a color pop one here is the
all I see is magic eye shadow palette
this is a $20 I shadow palette I was
looking at the colour-pop website as I
was filming and it looks like they're
having a pretty big sale and this one
was on sale for $14 so I'm not sure when
the sale is ending but I did want to
note that in case it'll still be going
on when I do post this video but this is
the all I see is magic palette I was
super interested when I saw this palette
come out color pop is definitely a brand
that overwhelms me I feel like they come
out with too much too fast it's too
overwhelming but when something catches
my attention with color pop I typically
don't say no to it which luckily it
doesn't happen too often thankfully even
though color pop is affordable I still
do need to learn how to slow my roll
sometimes but the all I see is magic
palette I really really like this
palette I think about my videos maybe
you don't know this but I link all of my
makeup details in my description box
there'll be a section that says on me I
list everything from you know obviously
my foundation my eyeshadows my lashes my
nail polish if I can link my clothes I
will anything like that and I know every
time a lot of people do notice that but
there's so many times when I've been
wearing this palette in videos and
people are like I had to check to see if
you were wearing the all I see as magic
palette it looks so good so I've been
doing a lot of different looks with this
palette and I really haven't found a
shade in here that I don't like I
haven't used every single one of them
but it has been pretty close maybe
there's two maybe just this one I think
maybe this is the only one that I
haven't used but other than that when I
am in my review period I really tried my
hardest
create as many different looks using
different brushes different primers just
seeing if there's anything that like
maybe doesn't work and really this
palette is beautiful I love the shades I
feel like they're very pigmented they're
very easy to work with and I feel like I
can just create a lot I feel like I'm
getting a lot of different color
combinations out of this and I really
really like this palette so I would
definitely recommend this one I've been
having so much fun using it I also
purchased the no filter concealer from
colour-pop and I did mention when I
hauled it but this is the wrong shade
for me it's like three shades too light
for me I know a lot of people say that
this oxidizes on them so they actually
suggest going lighter because it'll turn
darker I didn't really notice that with
me I was hoping it would because when I
put it on it's like white white so I was
like oh please oxidize but I really
didn't notice it getting darker at least
not darker enough to match so really the
only thing that I use this for is I have
a couple of concealers that are a little
bit too dark for me so I will mix this
in and with those concealers or if I
feel like I have really tired like I
don't deal with dark circles a lot but
sometimes if I don't sleep well as I'm
filming today that would be one of those
days but I can get darkness like on the
real like inner corners of my eyes so I
will put a little dot of the concealer
in that area and then blend it all
together to kind of brighten everything
up but I can't use it as just like a
regular concealer like I normally would
because it's way too light and I would
look pretty crazy so I don't feel like I
have like the best review on this
because it's hard for me to review a
product that I can't really use properly
but from what I can tell I do like the
formula and if I were to place another
order with colour-pop I think I would go
you know a couple shades higher and try
again because it seems like a formula
that I think that I would like it seems
to be I don't like really dry concealers
and I didn't notice that this one was
very drying and it seemed to blend out
pretty easily and it blends easily with
the other concealers too so I do want to
give this one another shot I think it's
only six dollars as well but I don't
order just a six dollar product but like
I said when color pop comes out with
something that catches my attention I
will order it so I think I'm just gonna
kind of wait for that and then I will
try a different concealer shade but I
think it's pretty good and it is very
affordable so that's what I think about
the concealer
I also picked up a lipstick color this
is from the I love Sarah II collection
it is the shade of Reba this is an ultra
matte lip which I don't love the color
pop ultra matte lips they are pretty
drying on the lips which isn't my
favorite but I don't hate it because I
like products that don't transfer and I
like lipsticks that will stay on all
night I just kind of don't like the
longevity of them I don't feel like they
last for a very long time
but this was on sale for four dollars I
think originally at six dollars I got it
on sale at four which I was like okay
four dollars like you know you could
only wear this like four times I feel
like it's worth my four dollars and I've
worn it way more than four times I love
this red like I love this red I was
wearing it in my Black Friday haul I'm
pretty sure I had it on there I forward
and other times I've actually worn it
out we went out for a birthday party a
couple weeks ago and this is the lip
color that I pulled out because I loved
it so much and I don't wear red lips out
a lot but I love this color it is just
like this perfect deep red it dries
completely matte and I love a good matte
red lip I just think it's beautiful
again it's just it's not totally my
favorite formula but I do think that it
lasts really good on the lips like I put
it on when we went out and I didn't
touch up at all it had faded a little
bit but not to the point where like I
looked crazy and I only have like red
lining my lips or something so I really
do like this one and it's super
affordable but if you're looking for a
really good red lipstick I love this one
as if I had a few items from Ulta and I
believe I've used both of these in a
like first impression type of video so I
will have that one list it down below
but these two items are from Maybelline
first I have the new full coverage what
is this called it's on the cat the super
stay a full coverage of foundation this
is kind of like I revamp
like formula and packaging for
Maybelline when I tried it in that first
impression video I was super excited
about it I was very impressed I thought
it looked really good the foundation is
1199 at Ulta I was excited for it it had
a nice pump I thought that was good I
did like the color match on me I got 130
buff beige I thought the color match was
pretty good but one thing that I've
realized because I've been wearing the
out of this foundation trying it so much
it does oxidize on me and it turns kind
of orangish I didn't quite realize it
until one day I got ready at like a nine
o'clock in the morning and then I came
back to film at like 2 o'clock in the
afternoon where normally I do my makeup
and then film right afterwards but there
had been you know that break and when I
got on camera I was like what is going
on here like what do I look like and I
figured out that over time like it takes
a while I don't notice it right away but
it takes a couple hours and then it
starts to kind of turn colors on me and
it gets a little bit orange ish which I
don't - love that about this so I'm kind
of bummed because I really thought I was
going to just like absolutely fall in
love with this foundation and I didn't
quite happen for me it is very full
coverage like it covers everything you
can tell you're kind of putting on your
second skin when you put on this
foundation so the coverage is really
nice and I do think it lasts well
throughout the day it can get a little
bit heavy like if I use just a touch too
much or if I use a brush with this
versus the Beauty Blender I can kind of
tell like it does weird things around my
mouth like kind of settles in to the
lines and such around my mouth which I
don't love but I'm not a super full
coverage foundation lover I tend to go
more medium medium to full so it's just
okay for me I think you would have to be
careful about the oxidizing especially
if it turns orange on you like I
wouldn't mind if it just turned a little
bit darker on me I guess that wouldn't
bothered me but it definitely gets
orange on me so not cordate I don't know
how often I'll keep reaching for this
foundation because I feel like there's
others that I like more and like I know
what I'll continue to look like
throughout the night but this product I
absolutely fell in love with in the
first impression video and my opinion is
still the same this is the Maybelline
total temptation brow definer I believe
it is $7.99 you have a cute little
spooley here on one end and then you
have the product on the other and it's
kind of like this a teardrop shape I was
saying that it reminded me a bit of the
benefit goof proof pencil because of
that teardrop shape but it's actually
like smaller and thinner than the goof
proof and I am so impressed with this
brow pencil I
been reaching for it so much I will most
definitely repurchase this when I run
out of it and especially at $7.99 that's
not a bad price at all but I love it was
so easy to do my brows like even doing
them on camera which I can kind of
struggle with it was quick it was easy I
thought they looked so good I got a lot
of compliments on them and whenever I
have this one I feel like I get a ton of
compliments I just really really like
this pencil I picked mine up in the
shade a300 blonde they didn't have a ton
of different colors to choose from but
this one actually worked out really well
for me I didn't think it was too light
but super impressed with those very
happy with it
it's like one of my new staple brow
pencils again my hair is looking crazy I
was out last night and it was curled
with extensions so don't don't mind
don't find my hair today
but the final items that I purchased
from Ulta were all from a dose of colors
and I have some different lipsticks here
this is one of their regular lipsticks I
think it's called the satin pushup
lipstick that's what it's called and I
got mine in the shade mocha I love the
packaging I think it's really gorgeous
what it looks like and I'll do a swatch
of it here so mocha kind of like the
name would say it's a really nice deep
kind of nude brown I really enjoy this I
got a lot of compliments when I wore it
in a previous video a lot of people were
asking me what it was and I really
enjoyed this one it's the regular
lipstick but it's a very creamy and also
very pigmented I didn't have to work on
building this up a lot I like the the
shape of it I felt like it was easy to
kind of line my lips because I don't
typically do a lip liner it was easy to
kind of like line and fill in around my
mouth for the shape of this is the only
thing I kind of get worried about is
kind of crushing it because you can't
actually push it down so I'm worried
that I'm gonna like miss the cap and
break it but so far this has been
working really well if you like more of
the you know traditional lipstick
formula you're not really a liquid
lipstick lover I would check out these
ones from dose of colors I really
enjoyed it like these are seventeen
dollars is what I paid for
at Ulta like beautiful packaging
beautiful color really enjoyed that one
and I also picked up three liquid
lipsticks this came in the smuggle is
real set and I picked up the nude lip
set it is now sold out at Ulta if it is
still available at dose of colors I will
leave it link down below it was a
holiday exclusive limited edition one
but I
Oh Anna said on snapchat the owner of
dosa colors that she will be bringing
back all of these colors as permanent
lipsticks to the line it just won't be
available in that set anymore so I love
the dose of colors liquid lipsticks and
a lot of people were asking me if I
thought that this formula was the same I
guess there are some reviews out there
where people are saying the lipsticks in
this set are not the same as the regular
dose of color lipsticks and I don't see
that you on quite a few from dose of
colors up there liquid lipsticks and I
didn't notice any difference with these
so here are the swatches so the peachy
Brown is a let's cuddle and then in the
middle is lazy Daisy and then the last
one there is warm and fuzzy so those are
the three swatches I've worn all of them
I think I've worn every single one also
in a video as well I love them if I had
to pick a favorite I think it's lazy
Daisy I really like this one but I also
really like warm and fuzzy it's such a
beautiful kind of deeper pink and I
liked let's cuddle a lot more than I
thought I was going to kind of like a
really light peachy nude on the lips but
I really liked it and again I thought
the formula was the same so I'm really
happy with this said yeah those colors
up with lipsticks they were in my top
seventeen and twenty seventeen my
favorite products of 2017 I just love
the liquid lipsticks and I believe these
are $18 all right just a few items left
I did place an order from a Sephora I
picked up the Urban Decay afterglow
highlight palette I know a lot of people
have been asking me my thoughts on this
one I fell in love with the Urban Decay
single highlight in sin in 2017 it was
like one of my favorite highlights so in
Urban Decay released this new highlight
palette I got really excited for it and
I want to try it out now this is a $34
highlight palette for the four different
shades in here but it is on sale right
now at Sephora for $19 $19 so of course
I will have everything linked it down
below just if you want this palette I
would say to get it while it's on sale
because $19 for these four shades like I
think that's pretty awesome so those are
some swatches from the palette now I
will say that I do like this palette I
didn't quite fall in love with it like I
thought I was going to but they are
really nice shades and cliche and no
angel especially
these two over here they are really
really stunning these two don't quite
pack don't pack quite as much of a punch
but they are also you know the more
colorful highlights so I think that's
actually okay typically when I go in
with these I will place one of them down
first and then I will come and I will
top it with cliche or no angel but
cliche no angel on their owner also
really really beautiful so I think it's
really nice I just have to kind of build
it up just a little bit more and I
suggest using a bit more of a denser
brush with it like the Sigma FL three
highlights that need just a little bit
more oomph I like to use that a full
three brush and I think when using it I
do still get a really pretty highlight
with it it just wasn't quite like I
didn't quite fall in love as hard if
maybe I just had too high of
expectations for this but I do still
think that they are really nice
highlights but I would say if you are
interested in the palette to get it at
the $19 like I would highly recommend
this for $19 I do think that it's really
beautiful 34 you're getting a little bit
higher for a highlight palette even
though you do get the four shades but
$19 I don't think that you can beat that
price but I do still really like it I
don't think that this would make it into
like a favorites video or anything like
that like in my favorite section but I
would put it in like the fine section
how I do my makeup monthly I thought it
was pretty good I'll still reach for it
and I still do like the shades just just
didn't quite WoW me as much as I think I
was expecting last two items I had were
again from colour-pop I would place
another order so I did pick up the brow
pencil this is the kind of precision
brow pencil I think they have two
different ones this is the precision one
and I got mine in the shade dope taupe
and it is I have on my brows today I
really really really like this brow
pencil and it's only five dollars and I
did check it is for sale right now for
four dollars on the colour-pop website
like that's crazy to me but how about
the spoolie on one end and then the
other end like the only thing that I
don't really find myself loving about
this one you can twist it up but you
can't twist it back down and so
sometimes I don't want to twist it too
far up knowing I can't twist it down so
I find myself doing my brows and then I
have to stop and I have to twist it up
and then I go in some more than have to
stop and twist it up because I just
don't want to twist it too far if I
can't
push it back down that's such like a
small thing but just sometimes it
bothers me when I'm doing my brows
because I keep having to like pause and
readjust and whatnot but again for the
price I think that's amazing I did use
this in a video I will try to find it so
I can link it below as well and like I
get ready with me or first impression
and I was super super impressed like
very pigmented almost to the point where
I have to use a pretty light hand
because it could be really easy to go
overboard with this really I was very
impressed with this brow pencil and
especially at either the four dollars or
the five dollars I could see myself free
purchasing this for sure because I think
that it does a really really good job so
very impressed with that I've always
heard really good things about the
colour-pop brow products but I'm here to
say I think they're really good and then
the last item I got was the
kathleenlights dream street palette so
kathleenlights did another collaboration
with a color pop and i decided to pick
up the palette I did notice that this
one is sixteen dollars and it did not
look like this one is for sale on the
colour-pop website so I did want to
mention that this will be the sixteen
dollars now I use this one in a first
impression also and I was so excited
like I got so hyped while doing that
first impression video I used the shade
I think this one is called water-bearer
and then I also used this one right here
called a kaleidoscope I'd have to use a
setting spray with this one and it was
showing that beautifully oh my gosh I
was so excited I created like a mermaid
eye and I was so stoked and then the
very next look that I did I came in and
I used this a shimmer shade all over my
lid which I believe is called sweet
dreams I think and it doesn't do
anything it doesn't show up at all no
matter how much setting spray I put on
my brush that shade does nothing I was
like oh no what happened here and I kind
of found what this one that it's just a
little bit hit or miss um this I
thought was really pretty too but the
one right next to it didn't quite do as
much for me but I also created a red
look the other day and I used these two
shades really here but this one here
which is called spark that I used all
over the lid and I got so many
compliments on that one and that one was
just gorgeous and these lighter shades
are really pretty too but it's it was
little bit hit or miss for me in the
palette and I think I was just extremely
bummed that this one is basically just a
dud shadow it does nothing okay I was
like so shocked when I was using it I
was like how's as possible it was the
very next shimmer shade that I was
trying after kaleidoscope which was such
a bomb shade I was like what happened
here
how did this shadow get in here but
other than that the majority of the
shades are really really nice and for
sixteen dollars I'm still very impressed
with this palette I will say I am still
very impressed with it I still think
that you can create a lot of different
looks with it it's a little bit more
limiting than the all I see is magic
palette you get more shades in there and
there's just a little bit more of a
selection but you still get really fun
and unique colors in here I think but
then there are also you know still some
of the basics like the rose gold up here
that you can create a neutral eye look
as well but then you can go in with pops
of color so I still do really like that
one but I just couldn't wait to share
that story because I was like I can't
believe that shimmer did absolutely
nothing I was super bummed about that
but overall for the 16 dollars I still
would recommend this palette as well I
just still find myself reaching for it a
lot I do think it's really nice and the
color pop press eyeshadows continue to
impress me I will continue to purchase
more palettes from colour-pop because
their pressure tools are really freaking
good I guess after that that is going to
do it for my Black Friday haul a
follow-up video I hope that you guys
enjoyed seeing the follow up and seeing
how all of these items worked out for me
as a whole the majority of the products
worked out really well for me which is
awesome but I hope that you guys enjoyed
seeing my reviews I'd love to know have
you purchased any of these items
recently what do you think about them
and like I said everything will be
linked down below there's a lot of sales
going on right now and I will also have
my original Black Friday haul posted if
you have not seen that video yet but if
you guys did enjoy this one and you like
it the follow up videos make sure to
give this one a thumbs up I hope that
you will also consider subscribing
before you go I will not have a video
tomorrow of my gosh tomorrow is 2018 I
hope you have a fun and safe New Year's
Eve if you are celebrating I will be
taking the day off tomorrow so there
will be no video from me but other than
that I will catch you guys in 2018 bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
