hi everybody thank you for watching so
today's video is going to be a makeup
tutorial on this mat glam bold holiday
look so I'm really excited to bring you
a new makeup tutorial if you are new
here welcome my name is Samantha I post
videos almost on the daily because that
is what I do so I hope that you will hit
that subscribe button so you are
notified for when i post in my videos
that would be awesome but yes i am going
to be trying to do more tutorials on my
channel i've set it in the past and i
have failed miserably but i am back I'm
saying it again we're going to do more
tutorials here and why not kick it off
with something like super bold super
glam so that is what we are going to do
today this look I did something similar
to it for my Sephora vib sale haul video
like especially with the eyes so I got a
lot of questions on if I could do a
tutorial on that kind of like purple
smokey eye bolder look so that is what I
kind of recreate here today I use the
same palette that I used in that video i
did use a different lip because i just
got new lipstick that i wanted to try
out and i actually don't know yet if I
love it or if I you can really love the
color but I wanted to try it out today
so this is the look that we will be
doing in the video so I hope that you
guys enjoy it and why don't we happen to
the tutorial ok so I'm going to do the
eyes first since we are working with a
darker shadows so to prime my eyes I'm
going to use the Smashbox 24 hour photo
finish shadow primer I really like this
i just have like a little deluxe sample
size of it a lot of times I'll just use
like concealer when I prime my eyes but
if I'm going out and like going
somewhere for a long time or doing like
more complicated shadow work and really
want my shadows to stay I've been
reaching for this more and more I just
think it's a really good eye shadow
primer so the palette we're going to be
working in is the Smashbox shape matter
photo/matt eyes palette it looks like
this I have a lot of love for this
palette i just recently mentioned it in
a favorites video it's truly one of my
favorite pallets so the makeup look that
I was wearing in the Sephora vib sale
help
oh did come from this so I thought about
grabbing and other palettes I've got a
few new eyeshadow palettes lately but I
was like nope that's the look that I
want to recreate so I'm just going to
happen here and grab the shade right
here and just use a bh flat brush to
apply this all over the lid to kind of
set the primer don't mind my eyebrows I
need to get them waxed so bad but I've
just been so busy because you know tis
the season this is the season of being
busy and puttin others before your
eyebrows mi right into the shadows I'm
first going to grab the shade right here
it's just a really nice light brown
transition shade and I'm going to grab
my morphe m4 for one and just apply this
into the crease the what I like to do is
lay down my dark color right away and
then I kind of reexamine and decide if
I'm going to add more shadows so that's
just exactly what I'm going to do today
so I'm going to grab this shade right
here it is a really like dark purple
eggplant type of color and I'm just
taking the brush that comes with the
palette I really like this brush it's a
double ended brush and I'm going to grab
the more like flapped schrader I shadow
side of it and I'm not using any sort of
setting powder or anything these shades
are very pigmented but without a lot of
fallout so I'm just going to grab that
and place this all over the lid
okay then I'm going to pick up this
shade right here it's kind of like a
dark taupe color and my morphe em 433
just place a little bit on there and
then just kind of work this in the outer
V just kind of lightly lending back and
forth and then once i think i have like
a good amount of product on that outer
beat i'll start to sweep it in towards
the inner corner of my eye just kind of
want to make it pretty smoky out here so
to get that i just i take my brush and I
hold it at the very end so I have very
very light pressure and I just run the
brush in circles I mean just very light
motion very light pressure every once in
a while I'll do the sweep in so we're
kind of blending up as well but that's
kind of how I achieved my smoky eyes so
maybe that will help you but I think
having a good brushes key which morphe
brushes are really good holding the
brush at the end and just doing light
pressure don't be afraid to just stay
here and blend back and forth for a
while so if you're getting ready to go
to a holiday party like plan accordingly
don't start getting ready 30 minutes
before because it's going to take you 30
minutes to blend out your eyeshadow
right after you get the shadows where
you think you want them I'm going to
come in with my liner I'm going to use
the Sigma wicked gel liner it's just a
fantastic black liner one of my favs i
absolutely love it especially when i
pair it with the sigma e 06 brush like
it's just a teeny tiny brush really
great for creating wings and since this
is more of a glam look I'm gonna go for
more of a boulder type of wing so that's
what we are going to attempt here
sometimes you never really know how your
wings are going to come out but that's
that's what we're going for I will leave
these link down below they are my
favorites winged liner combination of
our winged liner I typically like to
we'll make the lion straight across
first and then like once I feel like I
have that good then I'll come in and
make the wing I don't know why I know a
lot of people just go right in with the
wing and I'm fill in the rest later but
that's just the way I prefer to do it
and I feel like I'm like warming up for
the way you know I'm getting used to the
brush you like I'm telling the brush hey
I'm back I'm getting used to the liner
like hey let's work as a team here so
that's what I want to do before I just
go in right away with the wing
but I make the line I go like kind of
straight out and then up what what
degree would do you call this is this a
45 degree angle math is hard but that's
kind of what i like to do some people
prefer to go more straight out some
people go more straight up that's what I
aim for and what I'm kind of trying to
do is like if my eyebrow we're to keep
extending they would meet so that's kind
of what I typically will aim for
sometimes I don't get it sometimes I
don't get it right there but that's like
what I try to aim for with my liner and
then i'll pick up a little bit more
product and then i come about three like
when i'm doing more of a boulder wing
I'll come up maybe like three fourths of
the way and then just draw a line
straight back down
so I have like some sort of like rough
outline like this and then I will just
fill it in
now of course you most definitely don't
have to go this bold with your waiting
if it is not to you but everyone smile I
just think to come out with like looks
frizzy wig
lashes I'm just going to do the CUDA
lashes in Samantha they're just really
pretty wispy fluffy yet still very like
glamorous eyelashes the adhesive i'm
going to use is from kiss sits there
strip lash black adhesive so that is
what our last game is going to be for
this i really like this adhesive not
only because it's black like dark tones
black adhesive i think it's just the way
to go but this is a really really long
lasting adhesive like if I know I want
my lashes to be on all night I will use
this it's actually kind of hard to get
it off at night to be completely honest
with you but I just think it's really
really good so this is the one that I
have chosen and i love these huda lashes
this is actually a brand new pair first
time I'm using them picked him up in the
Sephora VIP sale and once you've let the
adhesive dry for a good amount of time
you just gonna pop these on I always
struggle putting my right lash on and I
thought I dropped a left lash to do for
the one on camera I grabbed the right
one it will see all this goes but
typically what I'll do is come from the
top and just set the lash down
I'll press the middle on first then I
typically do the outer edge and then
i'll do the inner corner because in our
corners where a struggle the most like
so and i realized i forgot to do mascara
on my top lashes so try to remember to
do mascara just helps your false lashes
blend in more easily I totally spaced it
my bed I'm so sorry but I'm going to do
the other eye off camera just to let my
camera kind of it's about to reheat so
I'm going to let it cool down and then I
will come back and we will start on the
face ok I'm going to switch to the face
so to prime I'm going to use the
Maybelline blur and illuminates primer I
haven't used this primer so long but i'm
going to use more of like a math sighing
foundation so because i have really
normal skin i feel like i can't use a
mattifying primer and a mattifying
foundation it'll make me to Matt and I
can't use illuminating primer and a
luminizing foundation because it'll make
me too shiny so I do one to offset the
other that's what i have found bad news
I mean whatever your skin needs you go
with it but that's definitely something
that I have noticed for my skin for
foundation I'm going to do one of my
favorites is from Clinique the beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer I'm
in the shade 6.5 buttermilk one of my
favorite foundations is super super
long-lasting it has more of a matte
finish but not like super super matte it
has great coverage I just love this
foundation i recommend it all the time
and especially for like events if you're
going to be gone for a long time because
it's so long lasting it is what i
recommend all the time i'm just going to
use my beauty blender to blend this in
and this is my new Beauty Blender that I
picked up in the Sephora vib sale to the
black one I've never used the black one
but it definitely has a ton of bounce to
it which I love like I've had the nude
beauty blender that's the only other
beauty blender that I've tried and I'm
pretty much positive the black has
way more rounds than the nude one does
so I've been loving that forget to bring
the foundation on your neck as well
there i'm going to use the tart shape
tape concealer i am in light/medium
again just one of my favorites i reach
for this so often everybody has lost
their minds over this concealer but i
love it because super bowl coverage
long-lasting all that good stuff so i
just apply it underneath my eyes and
then to the center of my face where i
want to highlight and then I'll just
take my Beauty Blender again and buff
that out so the reason that I switch and
do my face after I start my eyes is
because I will then when I finish off my
eyes I'll do like my waterline and my
lower lashline and you see like with my
concealer I'm getting right up in there
underneath my lashline and so I can
disturb the shadows if I already lay
them down so that's typically why I do
it in this type of order in case anyone
is curious about what I'm going back and
forth and like I said you can take your
concealer here and use it to help really
sharpen up the wing beset the eyes i'm
going to use a new product this is from
kat von d it is her locket brightening
powder i picked mine up in peach so this
came out on sephora like cyber monday
deals but they were releasing a few new
like spring products early so i picked
mine up in peach i just really want to
try this out is I really like to put a
brightening powder on my under eyes I
just like right under eyes it's the look
that I like to go for a lot of people
like to use like a translucent powder or
just some sort of baking powder and I
like brightening powders I really like
the laura mercier secret brightening
powder I don't like her translucent
powder Kat Von D has a translucent
powder I haven't tried it but when I saw
the brightening powder I was like I
definitely want to try that this is
going to be my third time using it and
so far I have
really good things to say I've been
pretty impressed so far so like I said
they have three different shades that
you can choose from I went with peach
which is for like more of a medium skin
tone but I like using peach on my under
eyes
I'm just placing that on other eyes I
just picked up some with my Beauty
Blender which is damp of course again
just applying it I really liked about
this powder was I thought it made my
under eyes look so smooth but then also
really bright like I could tell that my
under eyes were brighter when I used it
so it was pretty impressed with that I
just let it sit on there for a few
minutes in fake since it's more of a
peachy color it blends in with my skin
tone a little bit more like when you use
a white translucent powder or baking
powder like you have like the really
stark white under eyes this one doesn't
quite have that effect what you do still
need to wipe off the excess powder when
it's done baking so to cream contour I'm
going to use the pure cameo contour
stick I'm going to use the contour side
it has a concealer side as well but I
just really enjoy the contour side so
I'm just going to carve out some
cheekbones here
and also on my forehead I've like just
enough room i'm a beauty blender to
blend this out
when you blend out the contour you want
to make sure that you're moving your
beauty blender or a brush or whatever it
is you're using to be blending it up you
never want to blend your contour down
because that will defeat the purpose of
while you are contouring
to bronze up the skin I'm using the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer and my
morphe m530 one of my favorite brushes
to bronze with
also I don't really do much of a nose
contour all the time sometimes I do but
a lot of times what I'll do is I'll just
like hit the sides with my bronzing
brush sometimes just to like bring a
little bit of color back into my nose
because it can kind of like fade away
between like foundation and concealer
and such so just a little bit of color
but if you are i nose contour girl and
you go ahead and contour your nose so
for blush I'm going to use this is from
marc jacobs it's just a little sample
size that i got and i can't think of
what the exact color is but i will leave
it linked down below but it's just a
really pretty like pinky peachy blush so
i'm gonna play it's one of his like soft
duo blushes and this is my morphe em for
27
and I'm just going to use my III from
morphe to just away the excess powder
under the eyes yeah I've been really
liking this kat von d powder did anyone
else pick one up let me know what you're
thinking ok so you finished off the eyes
I have misplaced my a cosmetics black
liner and I am very depressed about it i
have a new liner ordered but it's not
here yet so i'm going to go in with a
red this is best Oh from colour-pop it's
like a burgundy red shade I'm just going
to use this on the waterline and then
we're going to come in with some shadows
but I always like having something on my
waterline I would prefer a black i would
recommend a black for this look but i
also don't really love using gel liners
our liquid liners in my waterline that's
just my preference but i'm just going to
line my waterline real quick i'm going
to pick up my morphe e36 brush and I'm
going to grab this really dark brown
like hot chocolate type of shade from
the smashbox palette and I'm going to
sweep this on the lower lash line and I
love like a very smoky lower lash line I
mean I do for like just when I'm going
to the grocery store but especially if
i'm doing more of like a bold glam look
then i love to have a smoky lower lash
line
when I hit the bottom lashes with some
Maybelline lash sensational mascara
definitely add in some highlight if you
want i'm going for more of a matte look
and the blush that i use had a little
bit of sheen to it already so i figured
that would be good enough so i'm just
going to finish it off with the lips now
i'm going to try this from giorgio
armani it's one of the lip magnets and
the shade is in second skin I got they
sent to me from Influenster and i
actually just washed them last night and
I wasn't very impressed with swatches so
I want to try it on my lips and see what
it looks like second skin is just a it
said it was like what it's and the web's
like a vibrant rose and that is not how
it's washed so very curious to see how
it's going to be on the lips
so here is the giorgio armani lip magnet
on my lips honestly it goes on the list
much better than it looked in the splash
on my arm I will say that it is more
definitely more of a vibrant pink on the
lips that makes me happy was a little
bit hard to put on the applicators a
little bit different and I felt like it
doesn't pick up a lot of product so I
had to go back in a couple times just to
get the initial application on my lips
but it looks pretty so far it feels good
but I don't know we'll see how it wears
I'll have a review coming up on these
soon so I don't know if I've mentioned
after I did my face and before I finish
off my eyes when I was off camera
lighting my camera cool down I did fill
in my brows I just used the benefit goof
proof pencil in at number two and then I
set them with you ready said brow from
benefit so did that off-camera you guys
know I'm not a big broth and so I didn't
want to do that on camera but then once
i have the lips on i'm just going to
spray my face with some skin and Naevia
make up finishing spray and then the
look is complete alright guys and this
is the final look what did you think I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
bold matt glam holiday look would you
guys think let me know down in the
comments below you definitely don't have
to go as bold that I did especially on
the wings like sometimes I just want to

working that way so that is what I
wanted to do for today would of course
