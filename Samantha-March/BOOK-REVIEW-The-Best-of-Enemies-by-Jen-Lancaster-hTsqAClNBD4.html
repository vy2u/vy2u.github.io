video is going to be my first like
in-depth book review video so I only
have one book that I'm going to be
talking about instead of like a group of
books like how I would normally do and
the book that i will be reviewing today
is the best of enemies and this is by
jen lancaster i recently listened to it
in the audio version and i loved it so
much and so i thought i would break the
book down for you tell you what i liked
what i didn't like how I thought the
story line went the characters if I
would recommend it all that good stuff i
do want to point out that i literally
just got a tattoo like two hours ago or
something so if you notice me like being
really weird with my hands on this video
it is because got some new ink so that's
why but i don't not because can see that
but it is the latin word for two right
I'm an author that is why I got it I
really wanted it on my finger especially
my right hand my thought was like that's
the finger that holds the pen that I
write with even though you know I pretty
much only typed now but that was kind of
my thought plan to get it it took me
years to get it because I struggled to
find someone to do finger tattoos
because I guess they fade really easily
so a lot of people will not stand behind
them but I finally found someone in our
town that does it and even offers like
free touch-up every other time I go to
get a touch up every other time I had to
pay and then in between it's free so
yeah who tattoo yes just wanted to point
that out too if you're like why is she
like doing weird things with her finger
like this that is why but if you would
like to see my review of the best of
enemies by jen lancaster so the best is
what the cover of the book looks like so
that is the best of enemies by jen
lancaster it was published August fourth
of this year 2015 and it was published
by penguin group now jen lancaster if
you were not familiar with her books she
writes both fiction and nonfiction book
she put out bitter is the new black
maybe was one of her first books that
she put out and it was a nonfiction book
and I was you know basically almost like
her memoir
and she did that for a few other books
and just I mean people just love her
books love jen lancaster she also does
devil in with the fiction works so the
best of enemies is on her fiction side
now i have read almost every if not
every book from jen lancaster and i
honestly geared towards more her
non-fiction side which is interesting to
me because I'm not a big memoir person
i'm not really a nonfiction reader
usually the majority of everything that
i read is fiction but for some reason
her nonfiction I just happened to love I
was asked by penguin to review this book
I did want to read it myself just
because I liked in Lancaster so much
that instead of passing it off to my
review team I thought you know what I'm
going to give this one a try and I am so
so glad I did so like how I mentioned I
did listen to it and the audiobook
version penguin did send me the ebook
copy of it but because I go on so many
walks with my dog during the day we walk
so many miles I like to be able to have
an audiobook that's my dog letting you
know that she's here to when you know
that I'm talking about her she wanted me
to let you guys know she's here but I
like to listen to an audiobook so I have
something to do and focus on and
concentrate on when we are taking our
walks just the two of us so I decided to
listen to that one in audio and I am so
glad I chose the audiobook version
because the narrator's words like
spot-on especially for Kitty's character
oh my gosh that narrator was just like
yes like I need to find the new writers
profile on audible or whatever i'm
assuming it was created through audible
and just be like hey thumbs up because
you did a really good job you know
probably did factor into my reading
experience as well so i wanted to be
sure that i put that out there that I
did listen to the audiobook version I
can also leave the audiobook version
linked below in the description box I'll
leave like the summary down there the
Amazon lang po link and anything else I
find I'll just leave it down in that
description box as always the story is
is that we follow two characters and so
we get dual point of views we have the
point of view from
caracal and then we have a point of view
from Jacqueline Jordan who goes by jack
so we have kitty we have Jack look kind
of just flip flops back and forth
between them we have kitty then we have
jasmine kid either Jack you get the gist
Oh kitty is kitty is like the supreme
housewife living in Chicago she is
married to a dentist who she calls dr. K
children and she just takes her role as
mother very seriously she also was able
to take her role as mother and kind of
turn it into a social media presence and
she created a blog believe it was called
the secret squash and she has blog posts
about basically like how to hide
vegetables in your children's food and
other mother and parenting tips and
those are sprinkled in throughout the
way and they are just like hysterical I
mean kitty's point of view to me it was
just so funny I'm saying this not as a
mother not as someone who worries if my
children are eating other vegetables but
for me a lot of fun reading about her
but kitty that is what she does she's um
she's a mother she takes her duties very
seriously and she also like in the
beginning of the book we get her kind of
taking a new girl under her wings um a
male in their group remarried to a woman
named Ashley and ashley is younger and
you know she has hair extensions and she
wears the wrong clothes and she wears
too high of heels and you know has fake
nails etc etc and kitty like takes her
under her wing and teaches her how to
dress and how to do her hair and how to
style and how to talk to fit in with
their group and I mean it's so keeping
up with the Joneses that it's hilarious
but we also get from Kitty's point of
view how hard it is to keep up with the
Joneses and I have to say I'm very
thankful that I nowhere near that boat
yet because it sounds exhausting what
these women had to go through the
birthday party is that they had to play
in the outfits that they had to wear
what their houses had to look like with
our cars had to be it's like oh my
goodness just to keep up with your
friends I mean
mmm that sounds tough so that is kind of
a little bit of a background on kitty
then on the other side we have jack and
jack is basically the complete opposite
of Chitty is a journalist and she you
know has covered war zones and she's
been in Iraq and she's written a book
about the girl floor and I mean she's a
town boy through and through and she
always has been and as we start reading
we understand that Jack and Kitty at one
point went to college together and that
is where their friendship became and
they also have a mutual friend in
between them whose name is Sarah Beth so
that's kind of how Jack and Kitty know
one another so starting from the
beginning of the book the beginning is I
mean I wish I knew how many recorded
minutes of audio this was because like I
said I listen to this so as I was
walking my dog all I was getting from
the audio was like letters from a hotel
saying basically their hotel room got
trashed and they owed this amount of
money and it was a hotel in Las Vegas
saying their hotel got trashed and I owe
this amount of money the name that was
always listed it was Sarah Beth and I
mean this went on for a while to the
point where I was like okay I download
at the right book right and I remember
actually checking my phone like okay
this is the best enemies by jen
lancaster right what am i listening to
but that is kind of giving us a
backstory of what's happening to can't
piece all the puzzle pieces together
right at that moment we understand as
the book goes on like what's happening
the story starts out you know we're
getting Kitty's point of view and we're
getting Jack's point of view and we're
learning about them we're getting their
backstory we're meeting who they are and
we are also while we're in the present
point of view we are also getting
snippets from the past point of view so
we're seeing how their friendship
developed and that sort of thing which
was really fun to be able to listen to i
really like when books go from past to
present i just find it interesting so I
really did enjoy that aspect of it but
as the book goes along we come to
realize that there has been a death and
this death is going to
Kitty and Jack together and Kitty and
Jack had a huge falling-out and they
have not been friends since I believe it
was like the end of their college time
of year I believe is what that time
frame was as the story goes along we
realized that it is Sarah Beth's husband
that has died in a plane crash and Sarah
Beth is Kitty and Jack's mutual friend
so both women are in Chicago they are
supporting their friends they're above
and they unfortunately have to be
together their woman is happy about this
fact but the two get together so once we
learn about the death of Sarah Beth's
husband then things really start to get
interesting because Kitty and Jack gets
thrown together because they both
realize that something is suspicious
about the death of Sarah Beth's husband
and I kind of feel like this is where my
review videos are going to get tricky
because I really do want to break down
the book but I don't want to give too
much away I want you to be surprised
just like I was when I was reading but
I'm going to do my best so women are
thrown together because of this death
and because of the circumstances now
sarahbeth husband trip is kind of like
an executive he has a ton of money his
death is suspicious because the SEC was
coming after him and you know for
possible like money fraud you know that
sort of thing I'm not really immersed in
that world but that was my understanding
as I was listening to the book and they
think there could be a possibility that
he actually faked his death and the two
team up together to try to figure it out
did he really fake his death is he alive
somewhere is Sarah Beth going to
basically have her life destroyed
because of what her husband did to team
up together to try to figure out what
happened and then it gets pretty funny
because you know they were best friends
at one point in time and now they're
trying to be civil again towards one
another they're almost trying to like
learn about one another again it was
really funny to see like Jack the huge
tomboy come into kiddies life like I
don't know she has so many funny moments
when she sees like kitties vehicle even
like kitties garage or how
so things like that it's funny to get
her point of view on them and then also
like I mean I've already said it that I
thought kitties character was absolutely
hysterical but her point of view on
Jack's life and that sort of thing is
super funny now of course we have a ton
of subplots going on as well and we also
get a lot of them as we keep switching
back and forth when past a present but
there are other subplots in there such
as Kitty having a relationship with one
of Jack's brothers and how that plays
out and Jack has a really interesting
subplot with her mother and her mother's
disappearance and what that means so
there's other factors going in along
there too and so as much as I was
enjoying it enjoying it I was laughing
on my walks then we started to get to
the end and I was like mind blown did
not see that coming the ending surprised
me I mean the endings I can't even
explain because obviously I don't want
to give it away but the ending really
surprised me there was a twist that I'm
going to admit I didn't see coming I've
read some reviews and people are like I
saw that coming and I'm like mom I
didn't I was surprised and it even made
the title make that much more sense to
me I was like oh wait a second it is all
clicking into place I thought jen
lancaster did an amazing job this book
was funny it was on point it was it mean
it was a heartwarming it made me laugh
and it surprised me it kind of shocked
me it had mystery was involved in there
I mean it was so good on so many levels
I gave it a five star review on Chiclets
plus and amazon and goodreads and all
those places and it's one that I'm
talking to everybody about because I
thought it was such a good book and I
really really hope you guys read it if
you haven't read anything by jen
lancaster i suggest you do if you
haven't read the best of enemies i would
suggest you put it on your reading list
especially if you love women's fiction I
mean this is a great one if you like to
read books about the friendships between
women which is something that I really
gravitate towards too I suggest you give
this one or
and I really hope you like it if you do
have a dab'll or you know any sort of
audio book I would see if you can get
this one on audiobook too if that is
something that you are interested in
because the narration just made it that
much better in my opinion because the
narrator's I just thought were so
fantastic at what they did don't let the
beginning scare you away with all of the
the bills and the correspondence and the
invitations and things like that because
I know that I was kind of like what is
going on when are we getting to the
story but it will get there I promise
you and once it does it is so good
that's my quick little wrap-up I don't
know how quick that was I'm trying to
make this as fast as I can especially
because my finger is like throbbing and
I need to go put some use for one on it
but that's my review of the best of
enemies by jen lancaster to sum it up I
absolutely loved it I give it five stars
I sincerely hope that you can read it I
would love to know if you have read this
book or if you do have it on your
to-read list what your thoughts were if
you have been able to give it a read
have you read anything by jen lancaster
i would love to know if you prefer her
fiction or her non-fiction books i think
that would be very interesting to learn
and see other people's opinions because
you know we all have different opinions
mean if do you guys like this style of
review is there other books that you
would want me to go one-on-one with do
you want me to go more in depth do you
want any less in depth I mean I don't

feedback and please let me know what you
think if you guys don't really like the
