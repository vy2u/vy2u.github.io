I'm going to be doing a book deal and
I'm going to do it on a week at the lake
and this is by Wendy wax this is a book
that I listen to an audio and I think I
finished it like a solid two months ago
and I I don't know why I forgot about it
and I was like oh wait I need to review
this one going to be the only book that
i'm reviewing in this video so I'll go a
little bit more in depth than I normally
would and the other review videos just
talking about what I liked what I didn't
like if I would recommend it going about
the characters the plot all that good
stuff so if you would like to see my
review for a week at the lake please
don't watching first I mean I guess I
could probably address the elephant in
the room and that is that I'm wearing a
hat I don't think I've ever worn a hat
in any of my videos yet um couple
reasons why I'm wearing it one my hair
is just like it's not a good hair day I
tried leaving it down and I was like oh
and then I put it up not like oh I put
it like half of kind of like in that
weird like half top knot bun and I was
like oh not good sounds like what am I
gonna do and also I'm cold I just got
home a little bit ago and I had my hat
on and I kept it on after I got home and
then I was I went to sit down at my
computer and I was like you probably
take your hat off now and then I started
to film a few minutes later not like I'm
gonna put my hat back on because it is
chilly outside and actually did snow
like overnight and this morning but I
don't know I guess it warmed up enough
that the snow I'll melt it because it's
completely gone now but I'm still cold
so that's why I and I kind of matched my
shirt so I was like you know what let's
just roll with it but anyways to get
into the story so this is going to be
added we get the lake I will insert the
cover over here so you guys can see it
so excited that I can now put the covers
in these videos I'm so so happy i also
do have one more piece of news in my one
of my last videos i was talking about
the lighting issues that i'm having
since we don't have sunshine anymore and
i was getting frustrated about the
videos i found a new light it's like a
taller one and
I put it right behind my camera so i
don't know if that helps at all I don't
have the Flash on today the flash on my
phone is just like it's so harsh and it
just completely wipes me out like I
could load up with bronzer and I will
still look pale as a ghost with that
light on so I'm trying this lamp I don't
know I filmed the intro I thought it
looked okay but we'll see how it goes I
did ask for like a lighting set for
Christmas so maybe Santa will bring that
to meet if not I'll just buy it after
Christmas but to get into the story this
is a week at the lake by Wendy wax I
listened to it on audio with audible.com
that's where I get all of my audio books
from I'm a big fan of Wendy waxed I have
read a lot of her titles and she has a
lot of titles out there she puts books
out fairly quickly a lot of times I have
been offering her last few books to my
review team and then this one came out
and I was like you know what I just
haven't read Wendy in a while I know I
like her books like I'm gonna take this
one on so I did I decided to purchase it
for myself and purchase it through
audible so even though her publisher
said that they would send me a review
copy like a ebook or a print copy I went
ahead and purchased it myself via
audible so so I could listen to it on
audio book when I walked with my dog in
the summers seems like so long ago I
will basically we follow three friends
we have Emma Serena and Mackenzie are
three friends who they used to get
together like every single year they
would spend a week at and the
grandmothers lake house spend a week
together get caught up they all lead
very different lives they live in
different places so that week that they
could come together you know they all
really looked forward to it but then I
think it had been like five years since
they all got together and Emma kind of
cut out Mackenzie and Serena and didn't
really give any reasons why and then all
of a sudden she is like summoning them
and saying you know let's go spend a
week at the lake and they're a little
bit confused they don't really know the
for her actions and Emma kind of has a
lot going on there's a lot of secrets
that she's been keeping especially from
her friends and she wants to have this
time together so she can kind of come
clean and explain herself and that sort
of thing but before we can get to a week
at the lake emma is involved in a very
serious accident and is actually in a
coma and that's kind of where the book
like starts off so emma has a young
daughter and emma is from like a family
that is in show business but she
actually emancipated herself from her
parents at a very young age and they
were both like in the spotlight and they
really wanted her to be in there they
had her on TV shows and it just she
wasn't happy with her life and she
wasn't happy with her parents so she
divorced her parents and basically her
grandmother took over for her care but
her family has always still like been in
her life and there's a lot of
interactions with her mom and her dad in
the book that I thought were very
interesting interesting her mom was
quite a character but she has a young
daughter who now her daughter wants to
be in show business and on TV and emma
is kind of trying to persuade her not to
go that way because of all of her things
in the past so it's actually her and her
daughter or kind of like arguing about
that when emma gets hit by a car and
gets put into a coma so Mackenzie and
Serena were actually like on their way
to meet up with her to go out to the
lake house when they get the news that
she's been in an accident they you know
of course go to the hospital to be by
her side and then eventually Emma does
come out of the coma and they do make it
to the lake house to spend but Emma
needs a lot of help they have like a
like a nurse come in to help Emma with
her with her needs and she was so funny
she's like a like a Russian and her
scenes in the book I just I thought they
were so great she was she she brought a
lot to the table but the three
runs are out there and was daughter's
out there they're trying to help her and
then as the storyline keeps progressing
we kind of keep learning a little bit
more about Emma in the secret she's
keeping and of course we also learn more
about Mackenzie and Serena as well we
get point of views from all of them
though emma is kind of the main gal that
we follow we also do get sneak peeks
into Mackenzie and Serena's life they
have a lot going on in their own life
Serena is actually another famous
actress and in the beginning the book I
did kind of get thrown off because first
of all we're following three women but
then also Serena goes by the name
Georgia Georgia good body and then it
ova felt like we had four people were
following and I was like wait who's
Georgia again is that Emma know is that
the Mackenzie like I couldn't remember
so that kind of threw me off a little
bit but she's a famous actress she
cannot find romance she tends to always
not even fall but get together what like
married men we also follow Mackenzie who
her husband is like trying to make it in
LA as like a producer screenwriter
writer and he gets a really good
opportunity and goes on to LA while
she's at the lake trying to help Emma
and so they are apart and what kind of
looked like a perfect marriage and the
beginning we kind of learn more and more
about the two of them they're childless
they were not able to have children
after after she had a miscarriage and
that's been a lot going on in their
lives then he's trying to make it in LA
and she's not so sure about that life so
there's a lot going on with them and
then of course the the biggest thing of
all is emma is actually hiding that one
but two different secrets one kind of
about her health and then one is
something that affects the friendships
of everyone involved and as I I didn't
know what the big big secret was until
we got closer to the end and then I was
like I think I know where this is going
I think I know where this is going it
went where I thought it was going to go
and I thought it was very interesting
how everything played out at the end
because it's a secret that can really
damage friendships can damage lives and
image marriages can damage I mean a
whole slew of things and so I just kind
of wondered you know how is this going
to play out how are these women going to
react how is the friendship going to
last like what what's all going to
happen here so it was very interesting
that I was kind of worried that maybe it
would come out and then the book would
kind of end and we'd have to think for
ourselves how does it play out but we
did get I like the ending I thought it
all came together as nicely as it could
I guess I enjoyed that we had more to go
off of at the end of the book it wasn't
it wasn't a whole lot but I mean it it
was enough that kept me satisfied so
that's basically the plot I I had a
really good time reading the book it was
very easy and smooth and fast paced in
the beginning and then once we kind of
start peeling back the layers and
uncovering more it almost even picked up
even more to me and I kept getting more
excited to get outside so I could be
able to listen to this as an audiobook
and then when everything was kind of
playing out it was like it was so hard
to put down I just wanted to like walk
one more mile so I could keep listening
to it which I just thought was so great
that's you know obviously that's what
you want in a book you want to not be
able to put it down and so I I give it
five stars I absolutely do recommend it
if you're a fan of women's fiction this
one was definitely a great one I thought
characters that was that like a little
bit of confusion with the Serena Georgia
and but once you started getting more
into the book then it was easy to kind
of break down the different characters
so then I would know who they were each
character kind of brought something
different to the table and I'm glad that
we got all the different point of views
in there that definitely added a lot to
the story I like that there was a lot
focused on the daughter as well I
thought she was a really interesting
character and then like
said Emma's mother especially was one
who at one point I just remember being
so furious and it's so funny because I
can remember the exact point like where
I was on my walk with my dog when a
particular scene with the daughters
birthday is happening and what the mom
does they're like I can remember where I
was and just thinking like what a
terrible woman what is wrong with her
and so it's so funny how those scenes
can stick out to you but that one
definitely did and then the the nurse
the Russian nurse she was absolutely
hysterical I loved her this was an audio
book so it was being narrated I thought
the narrator did a fantastic job doing
her narration the her scenes definitely
had me cracking up so not only was the
main cast I thought built really well
but also the supporting cast was very
well written and kept me very engaged in
the story you know this is an
interesting one because while I loved it
so much I don't always love what the
characters were doing like was Serena I
didn't enjoy that she was always getting
with married men you know that made me
angry and then she started getting
together with a guy who we didn't know
for sure was he still married was he not
still married but it seemed like a bad
idea and I was like no stuff don't do it
but she did it and then once you are
kind of finding out what more what
happened with Emma like you know I don't
agree with everything that she did
either but I like books like that
because they are real not everyone is
perfect people make mistakes you know we
know that so it's nice to have a real
relatable book especially one that makes
you think and makes you wonder you know
what if i was in ms shoes what if i was
in mckenzie shoes sort of Oz and Serena
shoes you know how would I react to the
different situations that were happening
and I really like that in a book so this
one I thought had a lot going for it
again if you're women's fiction fan
definitely one that I think would be a
good one to pick up if you haven't read
anything by Wendy wax she is definitely
an author that I do recommend she's a
best-selling author for a reason she
writes a lot of books a lot of great
books and a week at the lake was know
that my
you uh we get the lake by Wendy wax I
hope you guys enjoyed that book review

you want me to review or do a one-on-one
review with please do leave in the
comments below my audiobook listening to
have gone down quite a bit now that it's
winter and snowy and cold in Iowa I do
not get to go on walks with my dog
anymore I'm very sad about it but what I
have started doing is like cleaning my
house like the other night I decided to
reorganize my closet I went shopping you
know of course for black friday and
cyber monday i got a few new items and
so when I go shopping like that and i
buy more than like two things I try to
go through my closet and take out you
know clothes that I'm not wearing any
more especially around the holidays I'm
very much into like giving and giving
back and that sort of thing so me and my
husband put together big old pile of
stuff to take to our goodwill right by
our house so I did that over one weekend
and instead of just kind of like blankly
staring into my closet and pulling
things I was like you know what I'm
going to listen to my audio book because
I haven't been able to listen to it much
lately so I just put the earbuds in and
it really helped motivate me I helped
keep me focused I clean my whole
bathroom the next day too because then I
was like oh shoot I really did like this
audiobook I want to know what happens
put the earbuds in again when it serves
my bath and cleaned the whole bathroom
my husband was like what has gotten into
you it was so funny so I'm definitely
getting back into the audiobook trance
but i think i have like three credits
right now an audible that i really need
to redeem and get some new ones so if
you guys have any recommendations please
