today's video is going to be a
one-on-one book review I got one book
that I'm going to talk about and it is
the center of gravity and this is by
Laura McNeil so I will kind of be going
through the entire book giving my
in-depth review letting you guys know
what I thought about it if I recommend
it who I recommend it for and all that
good stuff hopefully this video isn't
going to be too dark we have a crazy
storm rolling in and watching the clouds
off of my office window and eek so I
will try to wrap this up as soon as I
can so we can get done before it turns
pitch black in my office what if you
would like to see my review on center of
gravity by Laura McNeil please keep
watches center of gravity this is by
Laura McNeil now Laura also writes under
the pen name of Lauren Clark and under
that name she writes kind of like more
lighthearted women's fiction the chiclet
side of things and so she separates her
her pen names by the genre that she
writes which a lot of authors do tend to
do i do see that because sometimes
readers will expect you know they expect
one thing like you know for lauren clark
they expect the lighter side the chiclet
side and then if Lauren Clark comes out
with a new book and it's this domestic
suspense thriller like center of gravity
is some of those readers actually can
tend to get upset they don't think
authors can write several genres so
there's a lot of authors that do it so
if we can sell it is another a big name
that also writes under a different pen
name so there's a little bit of a back
story on Lauren McNeil now I did notice
that there is another book for pre-order
on amazon by Laura McNeil and it's
called sister dear the cover kind of
does remind me of center of gravity like
it's a different color but just kind of
like the vibe of the cover reminds me of
center of gravity I'm is actually not
scheduled to come out until April of
2016 so it's like way crazy early on
pre-order but I definitely have that
marked because I loved center of gravity
so much that if a sister beer is
anything like it I think I would really
like it so just
sup out there that there could be
another one very similar to center of
gravity coming out but in center of
gravity so maybe I should preface this
video by saying I loved this book I love
this book I give it five stars on
chocolate plus on amazon and goodreads
all those places I could not put it down
I talked to so many people about it but
at the same time it scared the crap out
of me and I remember one night I was
sitting in my office I was working late
so it was probably like 11-1130 I mean
it was it was late at night I was alone
in my office which is in our downstairs
my husband and our dog we're upstairs
sleeping but it was to the point where i
was reading it and like looking over my
shoulder like mmm is there someone
behind me like it freaked me out I was
so afraid I was gonna turn around and
like seeing my husband standing there
and he's gonna be like a totally
different person and who it scared me I
mean it gave me goose bumps at times oh
man but it was so so good even though it
scared me so I'll say that but basically
so we follow Ava Carson who is married
to Mitchell Carson they have a young son
who Ava actually adopted from Mitchell
because his ex wife had passed away so
they also adopted Jack and then she has
baby Sam with Mitchell so they are
married they you know seem to have a
great marriage to everyone outside
looking in it seems like their marriage
is probably pretty great but very soon
you kind of realized that Mitchell is a
sociopath Oh another like quick tidbit
about like how I was getting so freaked
out my husband's name is Mitch and his
name is Mitchell on the book and I'm
like man oh my god with everything but
okay anyways I don't think my husband's
a sociopath I don't think so but so we
start to realize that and it's actually
pretty quick in the book that Ava and
Mitchell separate and their problems
come to light immediately while reading
I kind of thought that when I
first read the blurb and I was getting
into the story I kind of thought it
would like slowly go out in the book but
it was really fast sorry i just looked
over and my dog is on her bench and she
was literally doing one of these she's
really tired we just got back from a
walk hence my kind of sweaty look I got
going on so they separate very early and
you can already tell as they're
separating that something is wrong with
Mitchell he is over dramatic he it seems
like he's making stuff up in his head
you know Ava doesn't understand what's
going on he's trying to apply the
children basically against Ava you know
like when people stop right there like
oh you know we won't talk about the
other one to our children because we
don't want them to pick sides like
Mitchell as saying horrible things to
the Sun and it just we very quickly get
into the drama at the book which i
thought was awesome I also thought it
was very interesting all the different
point of views that we get so of course
we have Ava and Mitchell's point of view
but we also have their sons point of
view Jack the older son I believe he was
eight in the book we get his point of
view as well which I just thought was
like super fascinating to get an eight
year olds point of view and I thought
his point of view was great I didn't
think he was too mature I didn't think
he was too young from what I know of
children that age I thought it was
spot-on we also get a point of view from
Ava's lawyer who's trying to help her
out and he has a whole interesting
backstory to him as well we also get a
point of view from liked the social
worker um the doctor who comes in and
speaks with the children and observes
the children when they're with both
Mitchell and Ava and I mean this book it
I mean I just frustrated me at times
that Mitchell was getting away with
everything he was getting away from he
was turning people against Ava people
were who were her friends you know he
did the classic like came into the house
when she wasn't there like turned on the
stove turned off the air like did weird
things like that but then he
had a bunch of his stuff like in her
bedroom and then called the cops and
said that she had stole his stuff
because he was living in a different
apartment he had already moved out and
the cops came and found in Ava's house
and you know just like things like that
that you know he's trying to make it
seem like she's a bad person he's also
trying to make her almost like lose her
mind like did I really leave the stove
on did I really turn the air conditioner
off in this heat you know little things
like that and those are the things that
just like spook me out these type of
books freak me out more than like
reading or watching about like zombies
are ghosts or things like that because
we're dealing with real people and this
kind of thing really does happen I mean
there are people out there in our
society like this and it's so scary for
Ava I just felt for because you know she
fell in love with this man she had a
child with him she adopted their child
and it just things were not as what they
seemed and then he was literally trying
to ruin her life trying to take her
children away from her try I mean it
just this book was so I don't what word
do I want to say it was like it was
gripping that's a word I would say
because I felt like I could not put this
book down I had to keep turning the
pages it was so suspenseful the writing
was so good getting all these different
point of views just to me really amped
the book up another level it was really
interesting to see what other people
thought it was interesting also to get
into Mitchell's mind and to like try to
understand what it was that he was
seeing even though it was really hard to
and then of course as we get into the
book we learn that there may be more to
Mitchell's ex-wife's death then we
thought there might be which I kind of
thought that in the beginning when they
said you know that Jack's mom had had
passed away immediately you think of
that because I don't I can't remember if
it was like Scott Peterson or wasn't
there some killer out there who murdered
like his pregnant wife but then come to
find out like he also had an ex-wife
that like mysteriously drowned and about
tub like I mean it just mMmmm else where
my mind goes again this is why these
books like freak me out more than like
the
supernatural because you just never know
but yeah throughout the whole book I was
totally invested in it like i said i've
been recommending it to everybody even
people who are like hey can you give me
a good like mystery recommendation I
like this might not be like mystery
mystery because I think Laura actually
defines it as a domestic suspense or
domestic thriller but there's mystery
involved in it you know you're trying to
figure out things along the way you
don't know how it's going to end the
ending was like I think my face was
probably white as i was reading the
ending I had goose bumps all over my
arms like oh it was so so crazy but I
loved it I mean I just hands down I love
this book it's one of my favorites of
the year that i have read it is
something that i highly recommend i mean
if if this kind of stuff this kind of
suspenseful stuff just breaks you out
too bad i mean i wouldn't recommend it
to you because I'm it did scare me but
not to the point where I didn't want to
read it because I was I mean I want it
to keep reading it but yes if you like
mysteries if you like suspense you know
even if you like thrillers if you like
psychological books you have to read
this one it has to go on your list like
I said I'm so excited to see that Laura
