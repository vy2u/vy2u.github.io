video I'm going to be doing a head video
and this is the reading habits tag on on
my list to do like for a really long
time and I'm finally getting around to
it I actually I wasn't going to film
today and I'm feeling like pretty casual
with like why no makeup on my no makeup
mine this is my no makeup makeup look I
have like super fuzzy hair so if I keep
messing with my hair I'm sorry but it's
like super soft and fuzzy today and it's
kind of like driving me crazy but just
feeling kind of casual relaxed it's
actually just a super like sunny day out
so I thought well I know we have a big
snowstorm coming so it's about to get
real dark for the next few days so I'm
like well I might as well pop on and get
a video filmed and why I do this type
video so i think there's 12 questions in
this tag and then i will be tagging a
few of you as well so be sure to just to
check the description box below they'll
be tagging some of you on there yeah
let's how the only question 1 is do you
have a certain place at home where you
do your reading I don't really I do most
of my reading at my desk I just put my
Kindle or my book on my desk and I read
in my chair in my desk at my office has
I'll sit on my couch to read but I guess
this is like one kind of habit I like to
sit on like the arm of the couch instead
of sitting like on our nice big long
couch I sit on the arm I don't know why
but I just do question 2 is bookmark or
just a random piece of paper I usually
always use a bookmark simply because i
have so many bookmarks I get sent
bookmarks like with every book I get
some I get sent a bookmark and a lot of
authors will just send me bookmarks and
packages and stuff so I just have a ton
of bookmarks so might as well use them
up question 3 is can you just stop
reading or do you have to stop at like a
chapter or section break and the
question really does make me smile
because I do I have to wait till the end
of it
sure or at least a second break but
really I prefer to end at chapters
versus section breaks but sometimes if I
know the book has really long chapters
I'm okay stopping at section breaks but
yeah that's really funny no I can't just
like stop reading my husband sometimes
will be like dinner's ready and I'm like
okay just wait I just kind of get to a
good stopping point question floor is do
you eat or drink while reading um yes
and I don't know if that means just like
casually reading but yeah if i'm just
reading and eating a snack I will but I
do read while I eat meals like I eat
breakfast and lunch by myself and I will
read well I eat I don't know what else I
would do I've always always always read
while I ate yes from a young girl I
always have like obviously if I'm having
dinner with my husband or something I
don't read a book but other than that I
will always read and like sometimes
usually what I'm feeling like I strain
which I can have a lot because I started
a computer for so long every day
sometimes if i'm feeling I strain I'm
like you know what I'm not going to read
at the meal like turn the TV on or
something but even the TV just bores the
crap out of me and I can't stand just
sitting there at the table eating
staring in a space like what are you
supposed to be doing well number five is
a multi tasking question that's two
preferred to read music or watch TV
while reading mine would probably be
watching TV I don't usually just like
randomly listen to music unless I'm
getting ready like doing my hair makeup
or something then I'll listen to music I
will also be reading at that time too
but a lot of times like especially if
like sports games are on or something
I'll go out and watch the TV but read
like a lot of times I'm like okay I'll
read one chapter and then I'll put down
and I'll watch like one quarter of the
game and then I can read another chapter
at watch home court in the game because
otherwise I'd literally read
all day and not stuff number six is one
book at a time or several and I
typically will only read one book at a
time but I say that because I read one
book at a time and and I've said this on
my channel before but because my review
schedule is so busy typically every
single book I'm reading is for a review
and a lot of times I'm on deadlines I
have schedules I have to post my review
on a certain date that I promise to post
on so I don't have time to just like
read for fun but so I'm reading a book
that i'm reviewing but usually at the
same time I'm reading a query I'm
reading a manuscript for my publishing
companies I'm reading books for authors
that I'm going to work on their
marketing for them you know so I'm
typically reading several books at once
but for my one book that i'm reviewing i
will only read that one because then if
i start bringing in more books like it's
just going to be too confusing so that's
my answer where seven is reading at home
or everywhere um I mean really
everywhere I would say I do most of my
reading at home but I will never leave
my house without my kindle and this is
the reason why I really enjoy Kendall's
vs. paperback are hard copies is because
not only is it so much easier to bring
even though I have a very large purse
it's always filled with stuff so to be
able to just slip my small kindle in
there is very helpful instead of a large
book but then it's also just easier no
matter where i am to be able to pull it
out like i used to get manicures like
every two to three weeks I'd go get a
manicure and I can just set my kindle on
my lap and I only need my one hand to
flip the pages while the one hand is
being worked on and yeah if I'm going to
a doctor's appointment I know I need to
wait in the waiting room my Kindle will
be there I'm getting my oil changed I
bring my Kindle just it goes everywhere
with me eight is reading out loud or
reading silently in your head I
typically will read silently um usually
the only times I read out loud is if I
am like proof reading a book I tend to
at some point read out loud just because
I think it helps me make sure that I
haven't missed anything let's see
the only time when I read out loud
otherwise it's silent number nine is do
you read ahead or skip pages um no I
typically we've never read ahead and so
funny because my mom does and i'll be
talking to my mom's a huge reader too
and we always talk about what books were
reading and she'll be like oh I started
this book but I read the back first so I
know what happened so I'm like how do
you do that hi hon hi how do you do that
but that's just that's the way she is
that's her system it's what works for
her I'm not able to do that and the only
way that I will skip pages is if a book
is not catching my interest like I said
my review schedule is so busy when I
tend to not enjoy books I read them
slower or you know I find myself not
picking up my Kindle as much and I can't
take four days to read a book I need to
read books in one to two days three at
the most so I can't I can't go any
longer than that so a lot of times I'll
skip pages or i call it speed reading
because I don't just like blindly skit
like oh I'm just not gonna read this
chapter i'll just speed read through it
because i have the ability to speed read
i don't know if that's enough about here
what but i can speak read and so that's
what i'll do if something is not keeping
my interest but i never want to just
stop reading a book because I get so
worried like I always make myself read
at least twenty percent of the book and
the kindle is very nice because it'll
tell you what percentage you're in once
i get to twenty percent if it's just not
working for me then I'll allowed myself
to start speed reading but I get so
worried like what does seventy percent
something crazy happens and i missed it
because i just put it down like I will
never just stop reading a book I can't
do that for ten is breaking the spine or
keeping it like new I usually break the
spine on my books because I don't know I
just especially with well you know
obviously with paperback books like I
just need the pages to be flat I don't
know what it is so I'm constantly like
re breaking the spine so the pages are
flat does anyone else do that like it
drives me crazy when they're not and it
like hurts my hand to have to hold the
book when it's not Oh anyone does anyone
know what I'm saying I feel like that
sounds really weird but it's so funny
because I remember at one point when I
say I'm a huge reader i'm totally not
kidding I remember like going to walmart
since
cell phone with my mom when I was a
little girl and my mom is one who takes
like forever to shop mom if you're
watching you know you know she knows I
mean it's no secret she likes to look at
everything and when I would go to like
Walmart with her she would go out to
look at everything and I would go they
had a huge book start in walmart back
back in the day I don't even remember a
book start was but I would go in there
bookstore and read and I got in trouble
once because I would be reading the
books in there which you know I guess
technically is stealing but you know
when you're eight years old and you want
to read I don't feel like that's the
worst thing in the world we doing but I
did get in trouble once because I would
break the spines and then they're like
well you know we can't really really
sell books because it looks like it's a
used book now and so when I would go
back into long are there any other
places where I would read like while
waiting for my mom to shop I would be so
careful to make sure not to break the
spice it's just like a random memory
that sticks with me we're 11 is do you
write in your books I don't I don't
typically write in my books a lot of
times i will take notes when i'm
reviewing books um but i will i always
have like well i mean right now i have
three notebooks by my desk um I always
have notebook by my desk at least one
usually more but i will keep notes in
that but i don't typically write in my
books and I think maybe it's because I
give a lot of way like whenever friends
come over our family I'm always like hey
pick a book for my bookshelf because
it's too full i give any more books on
it or I give books to like half price
bookstore or just donate them to
goodwill or I give them away so I don't
want to write it up just because a lot
of times I don't I don't keep every
single book that I have so no number 12
is who do you tag and of course I take
everyone who is watching this video I
would love if you were to answer this i
will be going through and taking some
views specifically as well though so
again like i said be sure to check the
description box because i will have a
few friends tagged alright guys so that
is everything for the reading habit tag
i hope you enjoyed this quick little
video i just wanted to take advantage of
the sunshine which is a rapidly dropping
as I've been
this video so I'm glad I popped on click
to make a new video for you guys I'm
hope you don't mind my casual attire in
appearance but hey sometimes you just
gotta do what you gotta do like I said
be sure to check the description box i
will be taking some of you out i really
try hard not to tag you if i've seen
you've done it so I'm like go to your
channels and go through your videos
trying to make sure but I know you know
I'm sure sometimes I retag people who
have already done it but this is a
really fun one because it brought up
like fun memories at certain points so
that was I thought I think that was a
good tag a tag to do so I hope some of
you book lovers do it as well thank you
