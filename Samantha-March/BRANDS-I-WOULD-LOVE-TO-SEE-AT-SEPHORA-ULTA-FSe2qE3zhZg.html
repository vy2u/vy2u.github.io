today's video is gonna be all about
brands that I wish would come into Ulta
and Sephora I saw my friend live from
live loves for makeup to this video a
while back and I've had it on my list
since then to do because I thought it
was such a good idea I will have lives
video link down below of course if you
have not checked out our channel yet I
hope that you will but I loved this idea
for a video so I've been wanting to do
it for quite some time so if you would
like to see some of the brands that I
wish would be carried at Ulta and
Sephora why don't we go ahead and get
started
guess it I love this video idea when I
saw Liv do it because I am definitely
someone who tends to purchase on a more
regular basis from Sephora and Ulta
versus like a brands individual website
and one of the biggest reasons that I do
that is because I'm simply someone who's
always looking for a deal
I've said it before in my videos like I
don't like paying full price for things
I either want some sort of discount
I want free shipping I want free
products I want like Rewards points
somehow I want to be able to use eBay I
can get cash back like I am always
focused on that like I'm just a deal
chaser so a lot of times you get the
better deals at places like Sephora and
Ulta typically Sephora and Ulta will
also have better like return policies in
place versus some individual websites
and brands and when you buy as much
makeup as I do and sometimes I'm buying
newer products that don't have reviews
out yet and I'm not a hundred percent
confident in them it's nice to be able
to kind of have that safety net like oh
man this really didn't work out for me I
didn't just waste you know fifty seventy
dollars of my money on it and I can take
it back or you know sometimes it's even
if it's only for store credit like I
mean hey at least that's a good thing so
I feel like you hear me say a lot my
videos like oh this is coming out soon
but I'm gonna wait till it comes in his
floor or outside and things like that so
when lifted this video I was like genius
loved it doing this video idea as well
so I have a couple brands here that I
want to chat about
now I will say lifted this one a while
ago and like as I've had on my list for
ever and the first brand that I wrote
down that I would like to see it Alta
was flower beauty and I am so excited
that flower beauty is coming to Ulta I
was like yes yes yes yes I've been
waiting for this day I actually have a
bunch of flower beauty on my face right
now I've talked about
our beauty and favorites videos best of
beauty videos I just really enjoyed the
brand and I'm excited to see it at Ulta
but I see on the auto website it says
it's coming soon on January 25th and
then products will start to be carried
in store on looks like it's February 8th
so very shortly we will have some flower
Beauty at Ulta which I am just very
excited for this was a brand that was
started by actress drew Barrymore and I
have tried out a lot of different
products from flower beauty and I've
been impressed with several of them
there are of course a few misses in
there for me but for the most part I
really enjoy a lot of flower beauty
since they are coming in to Ulta I am
planning on picking up a few more things
once they do if anybody would like to
see like a bust more so flower beauty
perhaps I could definitely do that one
but I'm really excited to see that I
thought that they would be a great fit
for Aalto so I was really excited when I
saw the news but yeah this I've had this
on my list for a while and that was the
first brand that I wrote down so I still
did want to mention that and to say that
they are coming in to Alta which i think
is awesome a brand that I think would be
really cool to see at Sephora is a
Charlotte Tilbury I was able to try out
Charlotte Tilbury for the first time in
2017 and I don't know if this is a good
thing or a bad thing but man do I like a
lot her products because Charlotte
Tilbury is definitely a high-end like
more expensive luxury type of brand you
can get charlotte tilbury on beauty lish
i recently made my first beauty list
order cuz I did the lucky bag but I
haven't actually done like a beauty lush
like makeup purchased yet but that's
another website that I'm pretty
intrigued by I know that they have a
really nice plan where you can kind of
break up your payments and things like
that I don't know if they have a reward
system or how their return policy is for
sure but it's definitely a website that
I've been looking at and I see certain
brands on there that I'm like ooh that
brain was in Sephora I would be buying
that right now I've had my eye on
Charlotte Tilbury for a while and I
recently have been trying out some of
her foundations the light wonder I
really enjoy it like really really a
drive with that in favourites categories
her magic foundation I also really enjoy
as well and I hear so many good things
about her lip products her lipsticks her
lip liners etc and I want to try them so
bad but they're expensive so again I
would like some sort of you know
kickback or something when I'm buying
them
or you know again that return policy who
plays in case something might not work
out for me but I have a feeling her lip
products probably work out for me but
she also has like a setting powder and a
blush that everybody raves about and
she's got a couple face duos out there
that I'm really interested in as well so
I think Charlotte told her it would be a
fantastic fit for Sephora and I would
love to see that another one that I
would like to see in Sephora is a g-way
I recently mentioned as you weigh in the
eight brands that I want to try in 2018
because I have not tried anything from
shuwei yet and I truly believe that one
of the biggest reasons is because they
are not carried at a Sephora or an Ulta
again just being honest I know that's
like not the best thing ever and I know
there's so many other Beauty youtubers
that do such a better job than I do of
you know trying indie brands or brands
that are you know specifically not in
Sephora and Ulta and I hope one day I
will get there but as of right now and
especially with everything happening in
my life at this moment I'm chasing after
those deals like a crazy woman so but I
would really like to see as you why
they're they have so many products that
I've eyed and yeah I have just recently
mentioned them in a will I buy it they
have these blush deals coming out but
I'm super interested in but they are a
little bit on the higher price point and
again with you know I'm never trying out
a brand you know I've never tried them
before I have no idea what their
customer service is like their shipping
is like etc or even their products are
like I do hear a lot about them I know
they send out a lot of PR and a lot of
people have discount codes so I feel
like I hear about them a time but it
still I still haven't been able to do it
but I think if as you I was in Sephora
or in Alta but for me I thought they
kind of made more sense to Sephora but
if they were I bet that I would be
purchasing g'way products another one
that I think would be really good at
Ulta that I wish would come to Alta is
makeup geek I have been using makeup
geek products since I think before I
started a YouTube channel when I first
started getting into YouTube and
watching a bunch of YouTube everybody
was talking about makeup geek I remember
people were making videos focused solely
on their favorite like makeup geek
eyeshadows and I was buying so many of
the single eyeshadows and I don't know I
feel like it's kind of a brand that's
not not as hyped as they once were and I
don't know I don't know why that
for sure but it really does make me sad
because I really enjoy their eyeshadows
and I've purchased so many from them so
I think maybe if they could get into and
I I feel like their aesthetic is maybe
better towards Ulta but I feel like if
they could get into an alter can maybe
kind of like revive them again and from
what I understand I believe the owner of
makeup geek Marlena she actually started
out as a youtuber I think is what I've
heard people say this before I mean I
really haven't been watching YouTube for
all that many years but I think that's
really cool and really awesome to
support I have made purchases of course
from the makeup geek website myself and
they do have a bit of a rewards program
at least they did the last time I
ordered from them so yeah I wish they
would come in it's like an alt I think
that would be fantastic another brand I
couldn't really decide which one if I
thought Ulta or Sephora but then I swung
it over to the Alta side and that's the
balm I'm actually wearing the new
eyeshadow palette from the balm on my
eyes today the meet matchmaker palette
and man I'm really loving this palette
I'm trying out so much new makeup I will
have a review video coming soon with a
bunch of new makeup releases but I'm
really enjoying that eye shadow palette
but the bomb is I bought the mary lou
manizer from the balm was my very first
highlight that I ever bought and I
actually bought it off of Amazon
randomly enough because Amazon I mean
they have fast shipping and you always
seem to find some sort of coupon or deal
over there and all of that fun stuff so
I actually purchased my very first
highlight from the balm from their store
on Amazon I know that you can buy them
they have their website they have like a
certified shop on Amazon it's not like
you're purchasing from a random seller
you're actually are purchasing from the
balm and then the balm is also carried
at Kohl's I think I'm saying that
correctly I feel like I enjoy a lot of
the products that I've tried from them
but again it goes back to something
similar to Jie way I don't try more from
them and I don't buy a lot from them
because they aren't in something like an
Ulta so I like if they were to come in
to a big store I personally would
purchase more from them and I feel like
maybe others would too as well so I
really wish the balm would come into
also because I'm really like especially
after trying the meet Matchmaker palette
like I'm super into this palette right
a brand that I thought could be a good
fit to Sephora would be coloured raine I
recently was able to try out color grain
one of their mini eyeshadow palettes
they came out with and very cute I had a
subscriber marine son that to me which
was so amazing and I've been testing it
out I think I've used to at least like
three maybe four times now and I'm
having a really good experience with it
and I know that a lot of people fell in
love with the color grain Queen of
Hearts palette their price point is a
little bit on the higher side like they
don't have to me I was on their website
the other night they don't have like an
abundance of products yet but the Queen
of Hearts really stole a lot of people's
hearts when that one came out let's get
funny but I know a lot of people really
enjoyed that palette but also their
price point is just a little bit higher
so when I was thinking about it I
thought maybe they would be a better fit
to Sephora I know they had a new palette
just released recently as well and yeah
I feel like that would be a good one to
come in to Sephora especially because
when I have talked about color grain in
my will I buy at videos and I've made
comments about wanting to purchase from
them I have heard some people say that
they're shipping isn't always the
fastest and there's been some issues
there so I mean I've never personally
ordered from them myself understand what
I've heard in my comments which when I
see comments like that I kind of get a
little bit worried and I ask those
questions a lot in my videos you know
have you guys made purchases from the
website and what do you think what's
your experience and I really listen and
go off of that feedback that I get and
so when I see that I'm kind of like oh I
don't know I don't know so I wish that
they would come in just for X I think
that would be pretty awesome as well
another brand that I had here for Ulta
is Pixie pixie Beauty I would love to
see pixie at Ulta I freaking love pixie
eye on so much from pixie oh man I
mentioned them in favorites a ton blush
highlights I love their setting sprays
I'm lucky I have four setting sprays
sitting there there is so much from
pixie that I really do enjoy I just
mentioned one of the face palettes from
them in my favorite face palette video I
really do enjoy pixie I know that you
can find them also at Target which is
which is good I don't go to Target as
frequently as I would shop for makeup
but like a Sephora and Ulta you know
Target if you have the red car you get
five percent off and sometimes there are
certain coupons and discounts there but
I truly feel like I would buy much more
from pixie if they were at Ulta also
pixies skincare is so
so good I like so many of the pixi
skincare products so again that's a
brand that I'm really like I don't know
I feel like I have this feeling that
they're gonna be coming into all too
soon does anybody ever you like you have
a feeling that something's about to come
and do a store because for some reason I
have everything I'm mentioning I feel
like Pixies the one that I'm like maybe
2018 is gonna be the year that Pixies at
Ulta Beauty I think that would be
amazing and then the last brand that I
wrote down that I would like to see it a
Sephora Alta is a dubious place I
recently was able to try out a dubious
place palette as well out the masquerade
mini palette and it's excellent I feel
like I hear so many people say amazing
things about the dubious place I should
repeal is also the blush palettes I just
feel like I hear a lot of really good
things when I first thought of dubious
place I actually put it down in my
Sephora category and then I was like no
maybe it would be better for Alta
because I feel like they're a little bit
more in the affordable side and
especially if I compare it to like maybe
like the color grain I feel like juvy is
place swings more affordable I know that
they send out PR as well and there are
discount codes out there too so I was
like maybe I'm just thinking of like
with the discount that it's cheaper but
I think for the most part our palettes
are more more ish on the affordable side
it's not like wet and wild or you know
elf things like that but it's kind of
more along like the pixie lines because
Pixies like drugstore but a little bit
higher I don't that's not what I felt
like for dubious place so I thought
maybe they would be a better fit for
Ulta but I don't what do you guys think
about Julia's place which one would you
put it in if you could but I mean hey
color pops at Sephora so what the heck
did we even lose all that company I
always hear so many good things about
Julia's place and there's been so many
times where I've almost purchased a
pallet almost purchased I had the blush
palette on my list for the longest time
and I kept staring at it but I was like
I just don't know if I should do it or
not so I would love to see Julia's place
coming into a Sephora or an Ulta but
after that those are my list of brands
that I wish I would see carried at
Sephora or Ulta PSL does everything for
today's video I really hope that you
enjoyed it and enjoyed seeing some of
the brands that I really enjoy or I
really wanted to purchase from or
purchase more from then I just wish that
they were carried at a bigger store and
I will have list video linked it down
below if you haven't seen her video yet
I think we had a few overlapping of
brands here and there but she also
mentioned some other ones that I didn't
so I will have her video linked down
if you haven't seen that one yet but I
would also love to know what do you
think about the brands that I mentioned
or what are some brands that you would
like to see carried at Sephora and Alta
as well I would love to know your
answers and are you like me like you're
just a deal chaser or is that something
that doesn't matter to you and you're
happily purchasing from any website I
know we're all different and of course
makeup is always personal preference but
I would love to know some of your
thoughts down below but other than that
that's going to do it for today's video
and if you did enjoy it I hope that
you'll give it a thumbs up I hope that
you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I'll catch you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
