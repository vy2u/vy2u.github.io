video is going to be my go-to Beach
makeup looks just when I go to look when
it's like oh hey you want to go on the
boat today yes I do or oh hey you want
to go to the marina de watch like music
yes I do or even just you want to go sit
outside and watch the guys play softball
yes I do and I'm not gonna show up like
this I'm going to show up like this just
a little bit enhanced you know what I'm
saying in the summertime I don't like to
wear a ton of like very thick foundation
except for like special events but if
I'm going to be sitting outside all day
and like the Iowa heat and humidity
there's no way that I'm putting a layer
of foundation on my face and putting
false lashes on a ton of liner like
that's just not going to happen so if
you would like to see how I get my go to
beach day makeup look please keep
watching one thing that you want to make
sure how we're already spending the
entire day outside is that you put
sunscreen on please do not forget your
sunscreen if there's one thing that I'm
like super weird about its sunscreen and
making sure my husband has sunscreen on
like I asked other people they have
sunscreen on like don't forget your
sunscreen I recently got this one in my
target beauty box it's from coats and it
says it's an SPF 40 which is really good
and this is the one that I've been
putting in my clutch with me when we
were going outside do your face your
shoulders your back don't forget your
ears like oh just wear your sunscreen
please so first I'm going to spray my
face with a primer I'm not going to do
any sort of like liquid regular sort of
primer so I'm just going to spray my
face using into navia makeup primer
spray I really really like this you just
want to shake it up before you use it
and spray it on your face it used both
the Scandinavian primers in my
bridesmaid tutorial look because it's
also good for like long lasting makeup
looks and that's what I think of for the
summer as well even if you're only going
to be outside for an hour to the heat
and humidity can make it feel like
you've been outside for so much longer
so these are really good sprays I'll use
the other spray when I finished but I
always spray my face with this guy said
I don't like to use foundation when I'm
going to be outside for long periods of
times but I do usually like to use
something to like even out my skin tone
or like hide any sort of like blemishes
that are going on so what I really like
to use is a BB cream my favorite BB
cream is from
it's their dream fresh eight and one
beauty balm skin Perfector it looks like
this I just think it's such a good BB
cream I I've had these in my collection
for years and years and I always buy
more of them so and this also has SPF in
it which is awesome this has SPF 30 so
you're just getting more protection more
protection from the Sun that's what we
need so I don't do like heavy concealer
and highlighting all the center of my
face but I do usually like to conceal if
I have darkness on my under eyes and
then also to kind of like brighten
things up under there but for that I
always tend to go for the Maybelline
instant age rewind one of my favorite
concealers and I love it for concealing
any darkness because i usually get it
like especially on the inner corner of
my eyes so that's where all kind of
focus it and then i'll put some on my
eyelids as well to act as an eye primer
for my shadows even though we only come
in with very like commit Amell shadows
but I still like to have a primer under
there to make sure it stays and then I'm
just going to buff that in it with my
Sephora 57 brush i also use that
concealer if i have any spots like
blemishes or anything that i want to
conceal further like I have my monthly
friend here so I'm just going to put a
little bit on their buffets same brush
camouflage it a little bit then I will
set that with the Rimmel stay matte
translucent powder and my ELF small
tapered brush like normal I bronzer I'm
going to use the too faced chocolate
soleil bronzer and my morphine and 5 30
and I really do want to have like a
really bronze to look I think of like
bronzed and glowy when I think of like
summer makeup or beach or pool day or
anything like that like I just think we
need to look bronzed and glowy that's
what I'm going for so I'm gonna do more
bronzer than I would normally do I'm
also going to like bring it in more than
I normally would as well and up onto the
temple we want to go for like the
bronzed goddess look that's what of this
look for blush this is the one that I
keep oh I just keep coming back to its
from the jaclyn hill and becca cosmetics
face glow palais de jade is rose i
spritz which is right here oh man i'm
going to use my morphe for brush it is
such a beautiful like peach pink shimmer
blush like you see that I just think
it's gorgeous and just my favorite it
this is like this is a summer blush if I
could pick one blush to where the rest
of the summer it would be roe's a spritz
out of this palette it's gorgeous if you
like to go pretty light on the eyes I
mean some people don't want to wear any
shadows some people want to wear lashes
to the beach I don't care what you do no
one's going to judge you it's just
makeup i'm going to show you guys what I
prefer to do but the little palette that
I've kept reaching for going to the
beach that almost kind of surprised me
this is was like an oldie but a goodie
it's from wet and wild and it is their
silent treatment palette and I know like
maybe first looking at it you're like
that's what you choose to like go to the
beach but these two colors I just think
are so pretty especially when they're
mixed together I usually leave like the
darker one out of it this is also what I
reached forward for like a really simple
smokey eye I think that was one of the
very first tutorials that I ever did on
my channel was a smokey eye using this
palette is like last year but I love it
it's super affordable these little wet
and wild pellets I think they're like
hidden gems truly but what I'm first
going to do is pick up my BH Cosmetics a
blending brush it's just a big fluffy
brush and I'm going to go into this
eyelid shade the last one down there and
tap it off and I'm going to put this all
over in the crease it is such a like
pretty shimmery like smoky gray purple I
have no idea how to really describe it
but I just think it is so beautiful and
I just I'm really attracted to the
shimmers I think of the beach and I
think it being outside I think shimmer
and be a little sloppy I'm this is
at precise we might start to melt up
towards the end of the days anyway but
just kind of being pretty sloppy with it
once i have less product on the brush
and kind of bringing it bringing it more
up towards the eyebrow i'm gonna pick up
my sigma e 54 brush it's just a like
flat shader brush and I'm going to pick
up what they call like the brow bone
color it's a really pretty very very
light pink shimmer shade and I'm going
to just sweep this across the lid I love
like just mixing these two colors
together I think they look so gorgeous
and I will pop a little right underneath
the brow bone as well now i'm not going
to do anything with my brows if you guys
have been here for a while you know that
i like just recently started getting
into doing my brows but i do not do them
often and first I thought about it and I
even thought about just doing maybe like
a brow gel like I have a tinted brow gel
that I use sometimes but honestly every
single time that I've gone to the beach
or on the boat or been outside I do not
do my brows so I when I do these looks
for you and I'm saying this is by look
I'm doing my look I'm not making
something else up and I'm not trying to
be someone else like I just simply don't
do my brows a lot and I'm sorry if that
makes some people mad but they're pretty
full anyways I know they have like a
little sparse areas but sometimes when I
do them I go overboard and then I look
very like bushy and weird and sometimes
it's better if I just leave them alone
and yeah like I said every single time
I've been on the boat or to the beach or
a lot of times even just like been
outside and I've done the light makeup I
skip the eyebrows I do feel lucky that
I'm someone who can skip the eyebrows
like because i actually have eyebrows
but i'm lucky but i just wanted to show
you guys what it is that I actually do
for this makeup look so that's why I'm
skipping the browse but of course if
you're someone who just enjoys doing
your brows you feel like you need to do
your brows you do them you do you
there's no rules I'm back in with my ph
brush and just kind of blend everything
together I mean
is that not like such a simple I look I
mean boom boom I don't do any eyeliner
reason being so I'm in Iowa like I said
and we deal with some like fierce
humidity I mean I know other places have
a super horrible as well but we deal
with some pretty bad humidity and it's
just you just feel like wet all the time
and sticky and it's not a lot of fun and
no matter what liner it is that I'm
using or how I'm applying it or what
primer I'm doing it is not very common
for it to stay in one spot and a lot of
times I'll get like liner up in here and
it's just not cute and I feel okay to
skip top liner like I I feel okay with
that but i am going to smudge a little
bit of this first shadow that we put
down i'm going to pick up my morphe e36
brush i'm just going to smudge some of
that onto the lower lash line i'm going
to put a little bit of liner on my
waterline just because I very very
rarely skip this step I'm going to use
from colour-pop it's in the shade
crybaby it's just a really like pretty
violet shade it's a very light color
like it's not electric purple but it's
also very frightening at the same time I
typically recommend using a white a
beige just some sort of nude liner like
a light purple in the water line to
brighten up the eyes make them look a
little bit bigger or make them pop more
but I especially do this when I'm not
doing top liner or lashes I will try to
do a brighter under eye color because I
just feel like it helps make my eyes be
open a little bit more so that's why I
gravitate towards the color pop for
mascara if you know that you're gonna go
in the water I mean I don't know if I
would totally recommend putting mascara
on I'm not someone who like I enjoy
being in the water like being in a float
but I actually don't typically go
underwater a whole lot and before you
think it's because I'm vain it's because
I actually have a lot of like inner ear
problems and once water gets in my ears
it hurts incredibly bad and I get very
bad headaches from it and it's not a lot
of fun and someone who loves water so
much it's
such a horrible thing I don't know if
maybe we should have gotten like tubes
in my ears when I was younger i'm not
sure what the issue is but it's followed
me from a child into adulthood which is
very sad but yes for mascara normally i
would recommend like something
waterproof I actually don't own any
waterproof mascaras nor do I wear them a
lot because I feel like they're really
hard to get off and they like irritate
my lashes but one that I really love is
the Maybelline lash sensational I know
that they have a waterproof version of
this but honestly I feel like this does
a really good job I have been testing it
out in the heat and humidity these last
few weeks and i have not had an issue
with it like transferring onto my skin I
honestly kind of think this is a little
bit hard to get off and when I first
bought this mascara I wasn't super
thrilled with it for that reason but the
more that I've worn it the more that I
solutely falls in love with it
Oh for highlight I'm going to grab my
morphe and 501 brush I'm going to go
back into the Becca and Jaclyn hill
palette and I'm going to pick up the new
shade which is Prosecco pop it's a
really pretty gold highlights and I am
going to highlight my cheekbones I'm
also going to highlight the sides of my
temple I just I've been really really
into like highlighting over here I just
think it looks really cool like when
you're talking to someone from the side
like when my friends do it all i can do
is like stare at their temple like oh
man your highlight looks really pretty I
mean I feel like only girls will or will
understand that but you know I'm gonna
do like a little bit above the brow bone
and then same thing on the other side
I'm going to do a little bit down my
nose and on the bridge of my nose a
little bit on the Cupid's bow as well
and then just because I never feel like
you did enough on the cheekbones I'm
just going to come back in one more time
and rub Prosecco pop were the cheekbones
just to make sure you got the highlight
good the lips I like to do a glossy lip
with this kind of look and it's kind of
been what I've been gravitating towards
lily and I have to all three of the
Kylie glasses and I've just been kind of
going back and forth just depending on
what shade I want I've been grabbing
these glasses but today I grabbed out
literally which is named a middle shade
it's a nice like brownish nude shade and
just apply this to my lips
hi guys and then once you have your lip
gloss on I'm just going to spray my face
with the Scandinavia make up finishing
spray just to help hold everything in
place and try to keep our makeup lasting
as long as we can in the heat and then
after you've sprayed your look is
complete guys and this is going to be
the finished look I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this beach day makeup
tutorial and just seeing with them i go
to make up when i'm going to be outside
all day in the heat and the humidity
