doing another beauty video today and
it's going to be kind of like a brand
review and i'm going to be talking about
makeup geek and i own this little Z
palette is filled with my makeup geek
shadow so I own seven shadows from
makeup geek and I actually found like if
I didn't watch youtube videos I would
have probably have never known about
makeup geek I like to watch jaclyn hill
and I think she's fantastic i'll put a
link to her youtube video youtube
channel in the description box below
because i like it so excited when I know
her videos are coming out because
they're always so good did a video like
last summer maybe and I was all of her
favorite makeup geek eyeshadows and I
was like oh I wonder what that is or
what that's about and she's going
through him and she's watching them and
they're all like she has a larger z
pallo than i do but they were all in
this Z palette because the eyeshadows
are if I take out their magnetic so the
back is magnetic and I just slip right
in there which i think is really cool
and so handy and so I ordered them and
I've done two orders so far to get the
seven and I'm pretty soon I'm going to
be putting in another order I already
have a few shadows in my bag so I'm
actually going to need your help at the
end of this video I will ask you for
your help so first I'm going to just do
my review and my feedback on the
eyeshadows and show you some swatches so
let's get into that okay so when I
ordered the Z palette from makeup geek
as well they have this is the small one
and it carries 9i shadows and then they
think they had a medium 2 and then they
have a large which carries a lot and
actually the next time that I put in my
next makeup geek order I'm going to
order the large one because i also want
to order some of their blushes and their
blushes are enlarged or pans than their
eyeshadows so I figure I'll need the
large one but
first shadow that I got I need to like
take these out the first shadow that I
got is called peach smoothie and peach
smoothie is a very good transition color
this is what i use i think i talked
about it maybe I talked about transition
colors in my BH Cosmetics review but
it's usually just like a lighter color
shadow and you put it on first and it's
going to help blend your shadows
together and Peach Smoothie is such it's
such a good color like I don't think I
could ever not have peach smoothie in my
collection because not only can it be
used as the transition color but
especially like during the summer
because i had this last summer if i
don't want to do a lot of makeup I'll
just like dip my brush in this and put
it all over my eyelids and it doesn't
look like I've a lot of makeup on but it
just kind of like brightens up my eyes a
little bit without having to really do
anything so peach smoothie I think I
think peach smoothie could be really
good for like anyone's collection I am
so happy with that shadow in the next
one that I have is called creme brulee
and I pretty sure all of these pretty
sure all of these were on Jacqueline
Hills favorites I like literally which
is like riding them down as she was
saying I'm like you up need that one
need that one but this one is more of a
lighter brown color and this one I like
to use if I'm going to be using like
really dark shadows I'll do like the
peach smoothie first or else sometimes
I'll just skip the peach smoothie and go
in with creme brulee because it has a
bit more color to it so i'm going to use
something really dark i like to use the
lighter brown shade or sometimes I'll
mix peach smoothie and crumbly together
and I think they make a really nice
color so I really like this I'm happy
with it I use it a lot but not as much
as i do peach smoothie so if you're
maybe trying to decide between two
transition color
I would probably say peach smoothie but
this one still an eyeshadow i still like
to use it sometimes i use it on its own
but i don't reach for it as much the
next one i have is called glamorous and
glamorous is it's kind of like a coppery
brown it's kind of got like some shimmer
to it and I like it but I very rarely
use it I'm more attracted to like the
silvery tones versus like the browner
bronzy tones maybe in the summer that
might change but sometimes I'll Pat this
on my lid just to kind of brighten
things up but again I don't reach for it
like a super lot I mean if you like the
the bronze e-type I shadows and like the
warmer I shadows I think you would
probably really like this one just on me
I find myself not reaching for it as
much as I do other ones like my next one
which is like one of my Holy Grail I use
this so often I wouldn't totally
recommend this to like everybody because
I think it's so amazing and it's called
cocoa bear and it's this really warm
matte brown shade I am actually wearing
it in my lids right now and it's the
only color I have on there since I was
doing such a bold lip color I don't like
to do a lot with my eyes so I literally
only have cocoa bear on my eyes and this
shade is so beautiful I use it so often
all of makeup geek shadows I think are
super easy to blend but when it comes to
cocoa bear like there's just something
about it I feel like I can use it with
any look anytime I can use it by itself
I can blend it with others this one is I
just would totally totally
recommend cocoa bear love it and then
the next one I have is another one that
I'm like yes you need this and Jaclyn
hill talked about it and I thought it
was amazing and she did a makeup
tutorial with it and I was like yes I
need that and then it was out of stock
probably because Jacqueline has like a
gajillion I mean I think she's almost
like 2 million subscribers on youtube
but I'm like I'm sure when she did that
video and rave so much about the shadow
like everyone went and bought it and it
was out of stock forever to the point
where I was tweeting makeup geek like do
you know when this is going to be back
in stock because like I really want it
and it finally came back in stock and I
got it and it's called bitten this is
bitten and it is like I don't know how
to describe it and I actually went back
and watched Jacqueline's video to see
how she described it and she was like I
don't know how to describe the shadow
time like me either how do you tell
people about this because it's like a
warm red color it's almost kind of like
a reddish brown but it's so beautiful
and when I was like a red eye shadow
like I don't wear red eye shadow that's
not like it doesn't look red on your
lids it just looks beautiful it's one of
my favorite colors where are my eyes
it's a huge favorite for me to where I
to line my lower lash line I use bitten
all the time I think it's so beautiful
bitten and cocoa bear together are like
such a match made in heaven those two
together how they blend how they work
well together it's just like oh my gosh
I think in my BH Cosmetics review when I
kind of just gave like a little bit
about what I do with my eye makeup i'm
pretty sure i said and sometimes i go in
with a red and this is what I'm talking
about bitten like you need this in your
life you need it I promise you the next
one I have is another favorite one of
mine and it's called shimma shimma so
this is shimma shimma and it is so
beautiful you will see when i do the
swatches for you guys you will just see
when I first got my package and this was
in order number one and i swatched it on
my hand and I was like oh and I'll early
took a picture of it was like can we all
just stop and take a moment and admire
shimma shimma because it is beautiful it
is it's shimmery I mean the name I feel
like pretty much describes what it's
going to do it's just such a beautiful
light color it brightens up your eyes so
much you can use it on your lids you can
use it on your like inner eyes use it
for an eye brow highlight I mean it is
just so gorgeous and I can tell like
when I look at it that there's a
definite dent in the middle because I
use it so much so that is shimma shimma
if there's a few that i can recommend I
mean this is another one that I feel
like so many people would be able to use
especially in the summertime it would be
such a good color so another favorite
and then the last one I have is one a
recommendation from Jacqueline and she
also did a makeup tutorial with it and I
think it was the makeup tutorial that
sold me on it and the it's called envy
and so envy is a really deep dark green
color it almost has like a maybe a
little bit of shimmer to it but not too
much and I'll be honest I think this
color is beautiful I have green eyes and
when I put on like a dark green with it
I will get compliments on my eyes all
night long I'll gaga's to fits my true I
color like it is I I don't wear colored
contacts or contacts in general but when
and it's so funny because a lot of times
they say like if you have green eyes I
think you're supposed to I like purple
or brown or something like that but when
I wear green my
just like stand out so much so I enjoy
wearing this but it is so dark like I
really need to go in with a light hand
or else I can end up looking Wyatt crazy
so I don't wear it a whole lot I I don't
do smokey eyes a lot that's not really
my look but it's still a really
beautiful color when I do use it i
really love it I just don't use it a
whole lot so if you're not really into
greens our darks or smoky eyes you can
probably pass on this one but if that is
your thing is if that's the look you
like to go far I would definitely say
check out MV because you might really
end up enjoying it so out of my seven my
favorites are definitely Peach Smoothie
cocoa bear bitten and shimma shimma
those are my favorites cuckoo bear and
bitten I just think are so good together
I i definitely recommend them together
they blend out so well peach smoothie is
going to be that great transition shade
or even to wear on your own in the
summer and then shimma shimma is just so
again it's just so shimmery it's going
to make your eyes look brighter so those
are my favorites and those what I would
really recommend out of the ones that I
have and then I can do some swatches for
you so this is peach smoothie you can
kind of see it on my finger there i
guess that i don't have the viewfinder
so i hope this works out but that one is
peach smoothie this is creme brulee so
this is kind of that more lighter
brownish color and there's page
smoothing from ballet together so you
can kind of see what the differences are
this is that glamorous so it's that more
bronzy shimmery shade and this one is
cocoa bear so it's the the darker brown
shade blends out really well so that one
is cocoa bear
that's next to glamorous and then I'll
swatch a bitten for you guys so you guys
could just like understand what's
happening so that one is bitten so if
you can tell like button it's like it
doesn't look like red like bright red
like it's not my lips like that you're
going to be putting on your eyes it's
just such a pretty it's just so pretty
it's just so bad this one is shimma
shimma I mean like whoa like I mean can
you even maybe you can even see it from
back here like it is so so beautiful and
then the last one is envy and then so
that's Envy the green so you can kind of
see it's like a deep darker green but so
those are my makeup geek eyeshadows and
like i said i was going to ask you guys
for help because i'm getting ready to
put like put my palette back together
i'm getting ready to put in another
order from makeup geek i know i want
their black eye shadows and they also
just came out with a huge line of foiled
I shadows and I've been hearing nothing
but amazing things from them the
swatches look incredible I believe the
one that I have in my like virtual cart
is called grandstand so I have their
matte black I have grandstand which is a
foiled I shadow and then I'm also doing
a blush and I think it's called
spellbound I'm pretty sure its
spellbound so those three are already in
my virtual cart but if anyone has any
recommendations or you have a makeup
geek eyeshadow that you absolutely love
please tell me because I kind of want to
get I mean I don't want to just get
three things because like i said i'm
also ordering another I'm ordering a
large Z palette so I want to make sure
that I can fill it up so if you have any
recommendations or even if you've heard
other good things about the other makeup
geek shadows or blushes please let me
know because I want to fill up my large
palette when it gets here because I
think these are so cool so think makeup
geek is pretty affordable I think each
of these regular shadows are like five
or six dollars and the foil I shadows I
think are like nine or ten so the wild
ones are a little bit more expensive but
they're supposed to be so amazing but
what I think is also really cool that
instead of going out and spending a lot
of money on a big eye shadow palette
where you're bound to have at least one
eye shadow if not more not work out for
you or you don't like or you never touch
you can create your own palette so I
just think that is such a cool idea you
can do it around you can do it yourself
and you don't have to spend a lot of
money to do it so again if you have any
recommendations please leave a comment
below and let me know what those are and
i'll be sure to get let and i'll be sure
to let you guys know when i get my next
order in and i can share it with you and
I really hope you enjoyed this video
