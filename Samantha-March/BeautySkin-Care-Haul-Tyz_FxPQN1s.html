video I have another hull I know I feel
like I've been hauling so much but in my
defense a big part of the reason why
I've been hauling so much is because i
was still purchasing for my big one k
subscriber giveaway which is still going
on now so that will be linked in the
description box below make sure you get
entered but it was like every time I was
going to buy something for the giveaway
I'd like buy something for myself so I
think this is going to be like my final
haul i know i need to put myself on a no
x will see however i do my birthday's
coming up let's see how far this can
last maybe i can make it like to my
birthday or like the week before my
birthday so i can buy myself a birthday
present you know Cara's in the title
because I wanted this to be focused on
skincare and then I just had a few
makeup items to show you but then I also
my skincare order that i purchased from
Ulta i also got a big old bag of samples
and i wanted to share some of those with
you and then today just like three hours
before i'm filming i went to CVS and I
lost control so I have a few non makeup
items or non skincare items to show you
first and then I'll move into the skin
care which I really wanted this hall to
be focused around to make it something a
little bit different I do also plan on
filming my skincare routine a lot of you
guys have been asking for my skincare
routine and i have a new one that is
updated from the last skincare routine
that I post it when I first hopped on
youtube and I shared what I did I'm
using different products now I have a
lot of new favorite products that you
will see coming out that i will talk
about so i am planning on doing my
skincare routine here very shortly for
you guys so stay tuned for that but
anyways if you would like to see what I
picked up in a few of my latest shopping
trips please keep watching starting with
a makeup first I think I only have one
lip items to talk about which I feel
like it's pretty impressive but this is
one of the next soft matte lip creams
and the shade is in Rome and it's a red
eye I don't know I thought this color
maybe it would be like something else it
wasn't quite what I envisioned it to be
um I mean I still like it and I really
do like the soft matte lip creams they
are very very calm
able to wear but it's almost like I have
to really work to build the color up
like that's just one swatch and I feel
like it's pretty light and like you can
still see my skin peeking through and
that's what I feel like when I put it on
my lips I don't feel this way with the
other two shades that I have in the soft
matte lip cream so I don't know I know
this is one of their new colors again
the color is Rome and I don't know just
not totally my favorite but also wear it
and again they're comfortable and
they're affordable so I went to CBS
today and I actually I went in for
something for my husband I came out with
the majority of things for me at least I
didn't forget what I was getting my
husband you know like and only bought
for me but still what do you do the
thing I was most most most excited to
get is a pencil sharpener okay the
struggle has been so real to find a
freaking pencil sharpener I'm not
kidding i go to the CBS they have like
you know the thing for the sign for it
but they're all gone I've had none in
the beauty section this is from Beauty
360 they I've never seen a pencil
sharpener in the CVS section not even
like a little handle and it just happens
to be sold out and which walmart one day
the pencil sharpeners were sold out I've
gone to walgreens they've been sold out
I've looked up and down at Ulta for a
pencil sharpener can't find one so I was
so happy when I finally found one I can
finally sharpen my lip liners oh and
just so you guys now i'll give you guys
an update and I did my latest colour-pop
unboxing this lip pencil was broken oh
snap like if you can see the whole like
tip had fallen off and i emailed
colour-pop and basically they said just
to sharpen it which is fine and I will I
didn't realize you needed a pencil
sharpener for the color pops I thought
you could either twist him or just like
once they were done they were done but
he said that you can actually like this
plastic part that you can sharpen it to
get more product so I'll do that but I
was still like I just lost a crapton
product but whatever it's fine first
they said they would send me a new one
and then they asked me to send a photo
so I did and they were like oh no you
can just sharpen and I'm like look at
all the product I lost whatever five
dollars it's not a big deal but just an
update that's what they said so I
use my new pencil sharpener try it out
so when I did a my snapchat Hall of when
I went to CVS I just snap chat I
typically will do snapchat first for
every like shopping trip I make our
unboxing hall that I do i do it usually
for my snapchat fame first because I
think you guys rock but I mentioned on
there that when it comes to like my
nails I do not get my nails done I don't
appreciate acrylic nails on me sorry my
dogs barking Ares Ares Ares Ares to use
acrylic nails I just feel like they
destroy my nails I don't have time to go
get filled like now I will do shellac
manicures every once in a while but
still I I don't love them for my nails
that's so hard to get the polish off and
i feel like i'm taking a layer of my
nails off and again i don't have time to
go sit you get my nails done in a salon
when you're self-employed every minute
counts of your day so sometimes what
I'll do if I just want to have fancy
nails because I'm not great at painting
my own nails I'm not great at nail art I
basically cannot use my left hand for
anything it sucks so a lot of times I'll
just use press-on nails and i know i
don't know that might sound like kind of
like cheesy or weird or immature but i
like them just fine and they work for me
and if I'm like going to something fancy
and I just kind of want to like dress it
up a bit with my nails I'll just go with
press-on nails they're having a sale at
CBS for the brand impress and so that it
was buy one get one half off and so I
figured why not these are like Matt
nails and then they have a shimmer one
that you can do and then these ones I
liked because they gave you three
different options you have a solid a
chevron and a sparkle so I just thought
they were kind of fun and I don't know
I'll test him out I'll see what I think
of them um I'm definitely getting more
into the press-on nails I know Nicole
Guerrero just came out with like her own
nail set from as he goes nail her if
anyone's tried them please let me know
I'd like to know your opinions or if you
have like press-on nails that you guys
really like please let me know because
I'm always in the market for them and
they were also having buy one get one
half off on the r del lashes and what
they have that I always feel like I need
to sack up I really wanted to get the
wispies the demi wispies are what I'm
wearing today and I really like them but
they were sold out so I just went with
the glamour I like these a lot i get him
quite frequently and i've never tried to
double up but I've been looking for
something a little more like glamorous
lately and so I figured the double up
would be a good bet so I picked up these
two so I recently purchased from alta
and they were having a special where if
you ordered like fifty dollars with the
product you got a free bag full of like
samples and deluxe samples and so I got
it and I mean it is like full of samples
and I posted a photo on my Instagram of
everything that it came with and I
thought I would just talk about a few of
the items that I was pretty excited for
but one is the Smashbox x-rated mascara
it's a deluxe sample of it I've been
hearing a lot about this mascara so I'm
very curious to try it I have not tried
it yet that is what the wand looks like
so I'll be testing this out very soon
another sample I got from a benefit is
their high beam and I believe this is a
new product for them but it's like a
liquid highlighter it says daunting
blend over makeup on the cheeks and brow
bones or anywhere you want a glance to
linger so I really enjoy our what's up
so I'm excited to try high beam at a few
different shade samples of the Becca
aqua luminous perfecting foundation I
have the backup backlight priming filter
and is one of my favorite favorite
primers some very curious about the
foundation as very excited to get a
sample of it because I'd rather have a
sample and try it out before I buy it
because becca is more expensive so i
will definitely be giving that a shot
here soon and if you ever see it at
aalto where they're having like a big
bag like this full of like samples and
goodies i mean i'm usually say go for it
because usually got some good stuff in
here there's like hair here in here
there's skincare there's perfumes like
there's a lot in there then my last like
non skincare item is the liquid blender
cleanser so at the liquid cleaner for a
Beauty Blender and it says it can be
used on makeup brushes to this was
actually like I think this was a one
your point perk on sephora and i picked
it up because i don't have anything
specific for my beauty blender or my
makeup sponges and since you can use in
our brushes too and it's little it was
like moving on the skin care i have two
items that were actually sent to me and
they were sent to me from the company
yogi surprised they are a company that
does like a subscription box but it's
based like it's focused on yoga I got
sent this because me and my best friend
we run the Instagram page the cheeky
chicks and we participate in yoga
challenges and sometimes we host yoga
challenges but if you win you have
different companies that sponsor the
challenges and you win a prize from them
and so we each one a yogi surprise box
and we each got a lifestyle box they
have lifestyle and jewellery that you
can choose from so they sent us a
lifestyle box and it had a lot of really
cool things in there and some of it was
also a skincare and I thought I would
include it one is a facial oil from
kensington apothecary so speacial oil
number two pure clarifying with pumpkin
and tsubaki oils no idea if I'm saying
that right I haven't used it yet at all
i don't even think i've opened up this
package yet i have not well that's what
it looks like um facial oils are like
all the rage right now I have so many
I'm getting sent so many but I was
really excited to receive this and I
will be trying it out sometime in the
near future also in the yogi surprise
box was from Pacifica which made me
excited they are a natural skincare line
and this is their seafoam complete face
wash and i have been using this for
probably the past week and i am loving
it i love the way it smells i love the
way it feels like it's gentle on the
skin but when i get done cleansing my
face like my face has a little bit of
redness like here usually I just feel
like it feels like it's actually doing
something you know but it says I can
remove makeup cleanse and tone it has
coconut water CLG complex with
powerhouse antioxidants and it's for all
skin types so I was really excited to
get this because I think this I saw this
at Alta like eighteen dollars and so
getting in is in a subscription box that
that was pretty awesome and I'm loving
it and it smells kind of like
scotchy and I'm fan so also send to me
from the company del organics is this
vitamin C serum and Dell organics
contacted me and asked me if I would
like to review this vitamin C serum I
love vitamin C I always have vitamin C
my collection when I run out I somehow
get more a lot of times of being sent
vitamin C and I'm pretty happy with that
because it is something I use regularly
so this just has a dropper so you just
it says to put like five drops and then
you just massage it onto your skin and
your neck and I've only been using it
for about three days right now so i
can't really like say anything yet about
it but i love vitamin C then this was a
weekly special when i purchased from
sephora last it's from the company fresh
it's their black tea age delay instant
fusion the treatment toner and it says
that moisturizes and it protects and
just none of the weekly specials were
like really jumping out at me and then I
saw this one and I was like that sounds
really intriguing I'm going to give that
a try so this is what the little bottle
looks like i have not even looked into i
just got this order so i haven't looked
into exactly what you do it says after
cleansing gently sweep over the face and
neck with a cotton pad or fingertips so
give that a try i also got a few
skincare samples somewhere from my
latest afford or sommat came in at that
alta bag but from Tarte there was there
Mary kuja see brightener I treatment and
I'm really about like anything that's
making my under eyes bright I just did
how to get luminous skin and I also post
it on Instagram my favorite products
that I use to achieve bright on her eyes
and I got asked if I would do a video
breaking down those products and
processes and yes I will do that so I
was pretty excited to get that also this
is from nya 114 strivectin no idea it
says high potency wrinkle filler so
that's what that looks like I always
want to try out a wrinkle filler why not
from Murad I got a hydrodynamic
quenching essence
it supposed to target and repair it's a
little sample of that guy boscia I gotta
make up break up cool cleansing oil
again these cleansing oils are all the
rage I got a sample of the first day
beauty facial cleanser I absolutely love
first aid beauty I saw this as a sample
first before and I was like I'm just
going to get it if I travel I can just
take that with me love that cleanser and
then from Kate Somerville I got
Hollywood's two minute facial that
exfoliate intensive exfoliating
treatment I actually have another one of
these and I haven't used it so maybe
i'll use them like back-to-back nights
or something then from although they
were having a buy one get one forty
percent off on garnier so I decided to
break down and buy the micellar water
I've been hearing so many people to talk
about it and so many people loving it
and I was like I'm just going to do it
so this is new from Garnier's as it
removes makeup cleanses and refreshes
and I've only used it a few times so far
I just put it on a makeup and rub it all
over my face it takes off my eye makeup
without irritating it doesn't irritate
my face I do have sensitive skin it's
worked fine so far it does make me feel
clean but I feel like I need to come in
with something else afterwards like i
usually use this and then i'll use a
cleansing oil and it just makes me feel
like I really made sure I got everything
because it really does just feel like
you're putting water on your skin I mean
it really it's it's doing everything it
says that's going to do what it's like
in my mind I'm like I just put water on
put something else but it's so far has
been working well for me it's not the
easiest to travel with because it's a
big jug of water but I like it the other
item I got is also knew from the garden
a line it's their ultralift miracle wake
up cream for all-day hydration says it's
their anti fatigue hydrogel moisturizer
so this is what it looks like and i have
been using this a lot it has really
likely place my botanics day cream it
just has a little pump and you pump it
out it is how it says it's like hydrogel
it definitely is like a gel consistency
but it feels so light on the face like
to me it feels like
water in a gel form and that you're
putting it on your face and it like
wakes you up and it does refresh you
it's got a good smell to it I'm really
really loving it I don't know if how I
feel about like a atty fatiguer like
wake up cream but I've been using it in
the mornings and I'm loving it so far
and then the last two items I have are
from first aid Beauty first day beauty
when I do my skincare routine will be
heavily featured because I have found a
skincare brand that I am sold on I love
for a beauty i'm recommending it to
everybody i'm talking about it i'm now
making repurchases i'm all about it but
the first thing i picked up is their
facial radiance polish and that this i
have not used before but i'm going to
put this in my shower it says it
exfoliates brightens and purifies it's
safe for sensitive skin it which I
believe that's kind of like first-aid
beauties whole thing is that it is
geared toward people with sensitive skin
which is great for me because I do and
it says that's a gentle formula and uses
natural exfoliant that safely resurfaced
the complexion for smoother more radiant
skin I like to keep some sort of
exfoliator in my shower and I recently
just ran out of my exfoliator that was
in there because I liked it like after
I've been in there for a while and hot
water and the steam opens my pores I
feel like that's a really good time to
exfoliate and get all that dead skin off
all that good stuff so I thought this
would be a really good option to put in
my shower so I will be trying this next
time I take a shower the last item I got
is a repurchase this is also known as
like my best friend this is the facial
radiance pads I love these things I I
first got into first aid beauty because
i bought a little sample kit on sephora
around the holiday time it came with
like the cleanser the repair cream
vitamins spray mist and these these
radiance pads and i just ran out of the
pads and i was like i have to repurchase
these are key these are key in my skin
care i love them i got the big guy they
do come in a smaller size other one had
30 pads and this had six
with the 60 which sounds like I'm going
to go through these I love them they
feel so good they definitely exfoliate
the skin like when i get done using them
my skin just feels very tingly but also
very clean major key right here all
