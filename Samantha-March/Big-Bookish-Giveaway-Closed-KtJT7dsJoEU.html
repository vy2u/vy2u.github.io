excited for today's video because it's
going to be my first giveaway video so
I'm so excited to bring this to you guys
and I wish everyone the best of luck in
the giveaway I jump into it I know I'm
looking slightly more fancier than I do
in my other videos but i am recording
this on a weekend and it's a big
traveling weekend for us and my hair i
don't know if anyone else is like this
but when my hair is straight and you
know i don't i don't ever straighten my
hair if i use a hot tool i'm only
curling it but if I just leave it like
as is as I get out of the shower it just
is like limp and gross looking and
especially I'm like two to three day
hair it just is a hot mess so whenever I
know that we're going to be traveling
for a few days I will always curl my
hair because my hair keeps curls for
like the two to three days so I can just
wake up in the morning wherever it is
that we are and be like ready to go so
that's why I'm just a little bit more
fancy you probably as soon as I get done
with this video we are out the door so
hopefully this will be a quick one I'm
just going to run through all of the
prizes that I have for you guys and then
kind of explain how to win but all of
the prizes plus all of the ways to enter
will be in the description box below I'm
going to close the giveaway on Friday
may 22nd and that's just kind of a
random date it's a friday and i just
learned that we're going to a concert
that night it so hey why not make
someone's day and then go out and have
fun at this concert sounds like a great
deal to me so the prizes I have print
books and ebooks and then just a few
like swag items that I picked up so for
the print books I have all of these for
you guys that it's going to be one
winner so someone's going to win all of
this so I'm like super excited for you
guys but I either went through my shelf
then one author also did donate a print
copy to this
but I kind of tried to pick like a few
different genres I have so many books
and so many different genres on my shelf
so I was trying to like maybe pick broad
and so you're kind of getting like a
mismatch of a lot of things but the
first one is called the rebel pirate and
it's by donna thor land and it looks to
be a little bit more on the historical
side it happens it takes place in 1775
in the Boston Harbor so that's one that
you will be winning you will also be
winning it felt like a kiss by Sarah
Manning I have actually read this book
not just not this one this is a new copy

it's a little thick but don't let that
scare you away because it's pretty good
so you'll also be winning that one and
then the next one you'll be winning is
death and real-time by bryn Bonner so
this one I had read this one actually

you should probably pick up a few over
other ones because they're really cute

arc copy of this one and I thought it
was extremely interesting I'll be

think it's a very thought-provoking book
and one that you can really kind of talk
to other people about but also be
winning that one last print book
to you will be winning paperback copy
was donated by Allison caiola and she
watched my video which video did i do
for Allison I think I reviewed did I
review I think I did a review video for
her first book which is called the seeds
of a daisy and then I also mentioned
that I had this one or maybe I did a
mailbox post with this one in it and I
mentioned how much I love the seeds of a
daisy that might be it but anyway so
Allison saw it and she thought it was so
cool and she asked if she could send in
a print copy for the giveaway that I was
going to be running which I thought was
amazing so she sent this over this one
is the silver cord and it basically
follows after the seeds of a daisy I
haven't read this one yet so I don't
know for sure if you need to read the
Seas of a daisy first before reading
this one but i highly recommend you do
because i thought that book was so
amazing i will link the video below
where i kind of touch on it and talk
about it but oh it was such a good book
so I'm really excited to be able to give
this one away to you guys as well so
that is all the paperbacks that you'll
be winning so there was six paperbacks
and total up for grabs and then moving
on to the ebooks the first ebook that
you'll be winning I actually have a

same author and her name is savannah
paige i love Savannah like with my whole
heart she has an amazing series it's the

two books from that series and I'm just
like yes because

you should read this one will hands-down
be on it I recommend it wholeheartedly

girlfriends there's how many books does
she have seven maybe I don't know for
sure but there is a lot of books in the
series and they're all amazing but you
will be winning two in the giveaway and
the first one is when girlfriends break
hearts and this is actually booked one

great that she's going to have that one

girlfriends you can kind of understand
the layout of the books so she's giving
away that one and then the second book

girlfriends series I hope you fall in
love with them just as much as I fell in
love with that series and that you can
read more from the series because it is
so fantastic and then the next ebook
that you'll be winning is called the
walk on the wild side and is by susie j
and it's a new release the book just
came out so and i love this cover i just
mentioned something on social media
about how much i love the cover because
the girl on there reminds me a bell with
like the brown hair in the yellow dress
and I'm just like yes takes me back to
Disney World when I freaked out when
Beauty and the Beast came we were
watching it's just me my husband what do
you do but we were watching the parade
and I was watching like the dancers and
my husband saw Belle first and he was
like look look look and I nearly dropped
my phone because I was so excited I just
thought it was really
I let my husband like new hell excited I
was going to be overseeing her I'm not
eight years old maybe they do with the
giveaway so you'll be winning a copy of
walk on the wild side bye Susie new
release just came out a few weeks ago
kind of the I just tweeted something
about the other day and what I said
about the book is kind of like a trophy
wife that is no longer with her husband
and she kind of tries to go out and
reinvent herself and chase her dreams a
very chiclet but very much like kind of
like self-improvement and and things
like that and I really really enjoyed
this book I really loved it and I'm so
happy that Susie offered to give away an
e-book because I think you guys will
really like it too and then the next
ebook that we're going to give away is
from marching inc which is my publishing
company and it's a collection and it
includes these three babies right here
so the e-book is it's on amazon it's for
sale on amazon only includes all three
of these books so you get three
full-length novels in the collection
called twenty-something because all
three of these books the main characters
that we follow are in their 20s so
marching inc me a cat and Laura we
decided to put a bundle together for
people who wanted to check out marching
ink and kind of wanted to get a sample
of what we publish so we put that
together in it sells for 499 on amazon
and each of our ebooks separately are 2
99 so i think that's what basically like
buy two get one free type of thing with
the with the bundle but I wanted to give
away an e-book of that and since I have
all the print books right here i just
thought i would show you the print books
because it's so much easier showing you
guys actual paperbacks than like trying
to deal with my tablet one day it froze
completely in the middle of me trying to
do a video i had to cut out like
seriously like a six-minute section of
that video because it was just me like
hidden buttons on the tablet and nothing
was
Finnegan and I was trying to figure out
what to do next in 20-something include
breaking the rules and this is by cat
Lavoie and it also includes hard hats
and door mats which is by Laura Chapman
and then it also includes my third novel
which is called a questionable
friendship by Highsmith march so those
are the three books that will be in the
20-something collection and you will be
winning an ebook copy of that so those
are so those are the paperbacks and the
ebooks that you guys will be winning so
yay I'm so excited and I have just a few
swag items that you guys will win too
they're like these are like so super
random you guys I don't even know like
once I started going around and looking
for stuff for it it just was like
getting weird but first up is just some
post-it notes but they're shaped like
hearts I love post-it notes and I have
so many post-it notes and have so many
different kinds of post-it notes and
it's like my post it note obsession it's
just like a little on the weird side but
i thought i would share that with you
guys and give you some post-it notes a
surprise because who doesn't use post-it
notes also have a movie this is the heat
if you guys can see the heat with sandra
bullock and by my spacing on her name
melissa mccarthy hello and this movie
it's still in the packaging because i
actually i think i have like three
copies of this may be why do i have
three copies I don't know but this one
is still in the packaging so I thought
that would be the one that I would give
away to you guys I think this movie is
hysterical of me and my best friend saw
it in the theaters and we were like yes
that movie was brilliant so it's just
one of like my favorite movies that I
like to watch with girlfriends so I
thought you might like it too and then i
have this clutch it's just a pretty
basic clutch it's white and it looks
like it has like little flower designs
maybe all around it and I don't know if
you guys can see this because I don't
have that view finder but it just has
like this magnetic pole and open
magnetic oh it's from express its yes
this is from express which is like one
of my favorite stores but it's I mean
it's fairly large on the inside does
have one little zipper too so I thought
this would be really good for like
spring summer time so you guys will be
winning that as well then the very last
thing that you'll win in this giveaway
is a bookend it's just like a black got
some designs on it bookend but I used to
have I mean I still do but I have so
many bookends for my bookshelf but now
my bookshelf is completely overflowing
so I actually don't need bookends
because i have so many books that they
hold each other up so I thought this
would be cute from my bookish friends if
you need any bookends I will be throwing
that one in your package to that is all
of the prizes I hope you guys like them
and want to win them I try to do kind of
like a variety of not only books and
genres with just a few other fun things
that I could put in for you as well that
means something to me or that I could
tell you a little bit of a story about
because I like to ramble on in these
videos so you know why not her all of
the prizes the Gibbon so the giveaway
will be open internationally so I was
kind of like a little hesitant to do
international but I just want everyone
to be able to be included so even though
i know sometimes like i'm sure the
shipping costs will probably be pretty
high to send out a big old box of books
and stuff but my main concern is just it
getting there I have so many you know I
work with so many book bloggers and the
ones that are overseas they're like you
know there's no point in sending me
print copies because I just don't ever
receive them they get lost somewhere
along the way or they just don't get
delivered or whatever happens so I'm
just really going to cross my finger
