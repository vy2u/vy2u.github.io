excited for today's video because it's
going to be my first giveaway video so
I'm so excited to bring this to you guys
and I wish everyone the best of luck in
the giveaway I jump into it I know I'm
looking slightly more fancier than I do
in my other videos but I am recording
this on a weekend and it's a big
traveling weekend for us and my hair I
don't know if anyone else is like this
but when my hair is straight and you
know I don't I don't ever straighten my
hair if I use a hot tool I'm only
curling it but if I just leave it like
as is as I get out of the shower it just
is like limp and gross looking and
especially I'm like 2 to 3 day hair it's
just just a hot mess so whenever I know
that we're gonna be traveling for a few
days I will always curl my hair because
my hair keeps curls for like the two to
three days so I can just wake up in the
morning wherever it is that we are and
be like ready to go so that's why I'm
just a little bit more fancy you
probably as soon as I get done with this
video we are out the door so hopefully
this will be a quick one I'm just gonna
run through all of the prizes that I
have for you guys and then kind of
explain how to win but all of the prizes
plus all of the ways to enter will be in
the description box below I'm going to
close the giveaway on Friday May 22nd
and that's just kind of a random date
it's a Friday and I just learned that
we're going to a concert that night so
hey why not make someone's day and then
go out and have fun at this concert
sounds like a great deal to me so the
prizes I have print books and ebooks and
then just a few like swag items that I
picked up so for the print books I have
all of these for you guys but it's gonna
be one winner so someone's gonna win all
of this so I'm like super excited for
you guys but I either went through my
shelf and then one author also did
donating a print copy to this
but I kind of tried to pick like a few
different genres I have so many books
and so many different genres on my shelf
so I was trying to like maybe pick rod
and so you're kind of getting like a
mismatch of a lot of things but the
first one is called the rebel pirate and
it's by Donna thorolund and it looks to
be a little bit more on the historical
side it happens it takes place in 1775
in the Boston Harbor so that's one that
you will be winning
you will also be winning it felt like a
kiss by Sarah Manning I have actually
read this book not this not this one
this is a new copy I read the AR C of
this one but I have read this one and
it's super cute and don't let like it
kind of looks like it's a little thick
but don't let that scare you away cuz
it's pretty good so you'll also be
winning that one and then the next one
you'll be winning is death and real time
by Brynn Bonner so this one I haven't
read this one actually let's see on the
back it starts with a killer makes his
final cut so probably a little bit of
mystery in there which I always enjoy so
you'll get that one too and then I'm so
excited for you guys to win this one
because I love this book it's called new
uses for old boyfriends and it's by Beth
Kendrick I love best book I've read the
AR C of this on and I think it is
amazing so I picked up this one because
it's just it's such a good book and so
are all the best books so even if you
don't win or if you do win you should
probably pick up a few of our other ones
because they're really cute too the next
one you'll be winning is the never never
sisters and this is by Elle Allison
Heller and I've also read the arc copy
of this one and I thought it was
extremely interesting I'll be excited
for if you've read this one or if you
win it and you read it please tell me
what you think of it because I think
it's a very thought-provoking book and
one that you can really kind of talk to
other people about but also be winning
that one last print book
- you will be winning paperback copy was
donated by Alison keola and she watched
my video which video did I do for Alison
I think I reviewed did I review I think
I did a review video for her first book
which is called the seeds of a daisy and
then I also mentioned that I had this
one or maybe I did a mailbox post with
this one in it and I mentioned how much
I love the seeds of a daisy that might
be it
but anyway so Alison saw and she thought
it was so cool and she asked if she
could send in a print copy for the
giveaway that I was gonna be running
which I thought was amazing so she sent
this over this one is the silver cord
and it basically follows after the seeds
of a daisy I haven't read this one yet
so I don't know for sure if you need to
read the seeds of a daisy first before
reading this one but I highly recommend
you do because I thought that book was
so amazing I will link the video below
where I kind of touch on it and talk
about it but oh it was such a good book
so I'm really excited to be able to give
this one away to you guys as well so
that is all the paperbacks that you'll
be winning so there was six paperbacks
in total up for grabs and then moving on
to the ebooks the first ebook that
you'll be winning I actually have a
paperback copy so I was gonna show that
to you
so it's cashing in by Tracy creamer and
I have the paper back so that's why I'm
showing that two verses my tablet but
the winner will be receiving an e-book
copy of this and I haven't read this one
yet but it's coming up soon on my shelf
so I really love Tracy and I'm so
excited that she offered to give away an
e-book so I'm looking forward for you
guys to win that have two e books from
the same author and her name is Savannah
Paige I love Savannah like with my whole
heart she has an amazing series
it's the girlfriend series and you'll be
winning two books from that series and
I'm just
yes because if I do like a top-five
series that you should read this one
will hands-down be on it I recommend it
wholeheartedly is such a good series
that follows girlfriends there's how
many books does she have seven maybe I
don't know for sure but there is a lot
of books in the series and they're all
amazing but you will be winning two in
the giveaway and the first one is when
girlfriends break hearts and this is
actually book one in the series so I
think that's really great that she's
gonna have that one so you can get into
the series you can see how it starts you
can meet all the girlfriends you can
kind of understand the layout of the
books so she's giving away that one and
then the second book that she's giving
away is when girlfriend's step up and
when girlfriends step up is book two in
the series so you'll get books one and
two of the girlfriends series I hope you
fall in love with them just as much as I
fell in love with that series and that
you can read more from the series
because it is so fantastic and then the
next ebook that you'll be winning is
called the walk on the wild side and is
by Suzy J and it's a new release the
book just came out and I love this cover
I just mentioned something on social
media about how much I love the cover
because the girl on there reminds me of
Belle with like the brown hair and the
yellow dress and I'm just like yes takes
me back to Disney World when I freaked
out when Beauty and the Beast came we
were watching it's just me my husband
what do you do but we were watching the
parade and I was watching like the
dancers and my husband saw Belle first
and he was like look look look and I
nearly dropped my phone because I was so
excited and I just thought it was really
my husband like new hell excited I was
gonna be overseeing her I'm not eight
years old maybe I didn't do it the
giveaway so you'll be winning a copy of
walk on the wild side by Susy new
release just came out a few weeks ago
kind of the I just tweeted something
about the other day and what I said
about the book is it's kind of like a
trophy wife that is no longer with her
husband and she kind of tries to go out
and reinvent herself and chase her
dreams very chiclet but very much like
kind of like self-improvement and and
things like that and I really really
enjoyed this book I really loved it and
I'm so happy that Susie offered to give
away an e-book because I think you guys
will really like it too
and then the next ebook that we're going
to give away as from marching Inc which
is my publishing company and it's a
collection and it includes these three
babies right here so the e-book is it's
on Amazon it's for sale on Amazon only
includes all three of these books so you
get three full-length novels in the
collection called
twenty-something because all three of
these books the main characters that we
follow are in their 20s
so marching Inc me Kat and Laura we
decided to put a bundle together for
people who wanted to check out marching
gang can kind of wanted to get a sample
of what we published so we put that
together in it sells for $4.99 on Amazon
and each of our ebooks separately are
$2.99 so I think that's what basically
like buy two get one free type of thing
with the with the bundle but I wanted to
give away an e-book of that and since I
have all the print books right here I
just thought I would show you the print
books because it's so much easier
showing you guys actual paperbacks than
like trying to deal with my tablet one
day it froze completely in the middle of
me trying to do a video I had to cut out
like seriously like a six minute section
of that video because it was just me
like hidden buttons on the tablet and
nothing was
and I was trying to figure out what to
do next and that 20-something include
breaking the rules and this is by cat
Lavoie and it also includes hard hats
and doormats which is by Laura Chapman
and then it also includes my third novel
which is called a questionable
friendship by Ice Man March so those are
the three books that will be in the
20-something collection and you will be
winning an e-book copy of that so those
are so those are the paperbacks and the
ebooks that you guys will be winning so
yay I'm so excited and I have just a few
swag items that you guys will win -
they're like these are like so super
random you guys I I don't even know like
once I started going around and looking
for stuff for it it just was like
getting weird but first up is just some
post-it notes but they're shaped like
hearts
I love post-it notes and I have so many
post-it notes and I have so many
different kinds of post-it notes and
it's like my post-it note obsession it's
just like a little on a weird side but I
thought I would share that with you guys
and give you some post-it notes as a
surprise because he doesn't need post-it
notes also have a movie this is the heat
if you guys could see the heat with
Sandra Bullock and by my spacing on her
name Melissa McCarthy hello and this
movie it's still in the packaging
because I actually I think I have like
three Happy's of this movie why do I
have three copies I don't know but this
one is still in the packaging so I
thought that would be the one that I
would give away to you guys I think this
movie is hysterical of me and my best
friend's side in the theaters and we
were like yes
that movie was brilliant so it's just
one of like my favorite movies that I
like to watch with girlfriends so I
thought you might like it too and then I
have this clutch it's just a pretty
basic clutch it's white and it looks
like it has like little flower design
maybe all around it and I don't know if
you guys can see this because I don't
have that viewfinder but it just has
like this magnetic pole and open
magnetic a oh it's from Express it's yes
this is from Express which is like one
of my favourite stores but it's I mean
it's fairly large on the inside does
have one little zipper too so I thought
this would be really good for like
spring/summer time so you guys will be
winning that as well then the very last
thing that you'll win in this giveaway
is a bookend
it's just like a black got some designs
on it bookend but I used to have I mean
I still do but I have so many bookends
for my bookshelf but now my bookshelf is
completely overflowing so I actually
don't need bookends because I have so
many books that they hold each other up
so I thought this would be cute for all
my bookish friends if you need any
bookends I will be throwing that one in
your package too that is all of the
prizes I hope you guys like them and
want to win them I try to do kind of
like a variety of not only books and
genres but just a few other fun things
that I could put in for you as well that
means something to me or that I could
tell you a little bit of a story about
because I like to ramble on in these
videos so you know why not sure all of
the prizes the gift
so the giveaway will be open
internationally so I was kind of like a
little hesitant to do international but
I just want everyone to be able to be
included so even though I know sometimes
like I'm sure the shipping cost will
probably be pretty high to send out a
big ol box of books and stuff but my
main concern is just it getting there I
have so many you know I work with so
many book bloggers and the ones that are
overseas they're like you know there's
no point in sending me print copies
because I just don't ever receive them
they get lost somewhere along the way or
they just don't get delivered or
whatever happens so I'm just really
gonna cross my fingers
that if you're an international winner

really want you to get it but so it
