going to be doing like three halls and
one for you I recently purchased a few
things from Ulta walgreens and i did an
amazon order as well kind of put
everything that i've been getting into
my alta bag because yeah thought it
would make it easier for me so I've just
my kind of like throwing things in here
as i get them so i remember to talk
about them so let's just get into it
earth because this is like the biggest
item in here first I have this Garnier
fruity style sky high volume mousse and
it says it's a 24-hour high volume and
hold extreme and the scent is apparently
cotton flower mmm I can't really smell
anything yet but I haven't actually used
it at all but I use mousse whole lot i
would say but days where I'm just kind
of like feeling rushed I don't have a
lot of time to spend in the shower like
shampooing and conditioning my hair and
then I don't have time to like wait for
it to dry and straighten what I will do
is I will only shampoo my hair and then
i'll skip the conditioner and i'll get
out and i will just run most through my
hair and I'll like scrunch it and then I
get like these I mean they're not curls
and they're not waves but they're just
kind of like really like beachy hair
with a little oomph and that last me for
like three days and simply all i have is
shampoo and most in it I don't use
anything else those days where it's like
oh I have no choice I use mousse I'm
just running out of what i have now so i
picked this one up as a backup for when
I do run out this is such like a bag of
goodies like I'm trying not to look next
up I purchased these from amazon they
are the bedhead urban antidotes
resurrection shampoo and conditioner and
I got these
I saw luster Lux talk about him um and
she mentioned that she's been using
these for like years or something like
that and I was like okay I feel like I
never really hear someone like yes I've
used the shrimp same shampoo and
conditioner for years like I'm
constantly switching on my shampoo and
conditioner trying to find one that I
really really love recently I've been
using like the kenra volumizing shampoo
and conditioner and I liked it a lot I
wouldn't say I was like I can't live
without this shampoo and conditioners so
I heard Lester Lux talk about it and
then there was one other youtuber that I
saw mentioned us and I was like okay now
the two people have said it like I'm
definitely going to give it a try but it
seems pretty interesting they actually
had so they have like the number three
on it I think they had one two and three
and each one kind of did a different
thing but I got three because it says
it's for damage level three meaning you
have really damaged hair and I was like
yes that's me says the girl who just
highlighted her hair four days ago like
oh I'm really excited to give this a try
i'm not quite done with my kinder
shampoo and conditioner so i'm going to
wait until I finish that out and then I
will give this a shot have some samples
to show you guys this was from my
purchase on Alta oh yeah because I did I
did technically two different all the
purchases when I did in store and what I
did online so my online one I bought
some two-faced lipsticks and it came
with a sample of the too faced chocolate
soleil bronzer and I'm really excited to
try this I haven't tried it yet you open
this thing oh that's what the bronzer
looks like and I've heard really good
things i actually just posted a picture
on my Instagram I have a new instagram
account called March books beauty and
it's simply for a chiclet plus I've
never had an Instagram oh really smells
like chocolate I've never had an
Instagram account just for
that like I've had my personal Instagram
account under my real name and then I
have a fitness Instagram account but I
just never really got one for my blog I
don't know why but I finally did it so
you guys can follow me there if you want
it's down the description box under my
social media info but I posted one of
this and I had several people commenting
like a bronzer is life that's all I use
my cool I don't know if it's likes
watching on my hand very well I don't
know if you guys can see that but oh
maybe you can but it's so it's medium
deep matte bronzer that's kind of fun
I'm really excited to give that one a
try and i also got so when you put an
order in through alta online you get to
pick like a sampler pack and i think
there's like a fragrance pack a face
pack in a beauty pack or something like
that but i did the face one and so what
they sent me was the Porefessional from
benefit they were Porefessional i guess
is what they call it but it says it's a
pro bomb to minimize the appearance of
pores I've heard really good things
about this it says that silky oil-free
quickly minimizes the appearance of
pores and fine lines for smoother than
to the skin and you use it under your
makeup so i'll give that it's just this
little symbol right here a shot and then
i also got the smashbox photo finish
foundation primer so again I've heard
pretty good things about all the
smashbox farmers they have so many of
them so curious to give this one a try
the thing that I don't really love about
ordering from alta online and the
samples that you get is that you don't
actually know what you're getting
whereas when you order from Sephora
online you get to pick three free
samples plus a free deluxe size sample
and you get to pick them so you know
what you're getting so I'm just glad I
don't have either of these and I've
never tried them so I'm excited to try
something new but it's like what if you
get two things that you already have
then you're like oh cool i did it i
bought some of the two face
melted lipsticks I got them I got some I
did it so I got these from Ulta and now
I can't remember how much they were but
they're pretty expensive for lipsticks
like let's be serious but they were
having a deal like if you purchased $35
or something of two-faced you got the
free bronzer sample and I was like okay
I have heard so many good things about
him in these head they've had so many
fun colors especially for summer that I
was like I just really want them so this
is what they look like I love the
packaging they're so cute I got just um
three and the regular one just like the
regular melted not the metallic melted
because I'm not a huge fan of like
metallic lips if that makes sense but I
got strawberry melted jelly donut and
fig melted faith so they're all the
melted ones and I i just have been
really excited i did use a strawberry I
just could not wait to use this one and
so that's strawberry and I don't know
once again to me I thought it came out
more pink than red and I had to like
apply it a few times to really get the
red in there like that means a lot out
on to my hand and I don't know do you
guys think that looks more red now so I
was like I had to keep adding coats and
I wore this when I went to a concert and
at one point my friend was like I'm your
lipsticks like down here like it really
did bleed a lot outside my lips I didn't
have a lip liner on and so I was like
okay duly noted like they're really
really long lasting but again and I
don't know if that this is just because
I wanted that red lip look but I felt
like I did have to keep applying it to
make sure i was getting that read like
yes the lipstick was staying on but it
was like fading to that pink color and I
was like no but I want red so I kept
putting it on a lot and I think you
really need a lip liner maybe just with
like the darker colors but it was kind
of like feathering outside
my lips so that was strawberry and I
have not used I just got these ones so i
have not used these ones yet but this is
big different color for me so the purple
one that's fake and i don't really have
any like purple-ish lipstick and so I
just thought that would this would be a
really fun color I watched a lot of
youtubers like lips watch videos and fig
each time was one that I was like that's
interesting I kind of like that so we'll
see it's watches really well on my hand
so I like that and then this one is the
jelly donut and if you guys can see like
this is what the applicator looks like
so it's just all white and it's like
soft what the applicator looks like if
you're wondering oh this is like really
pink I like this a lot so this is the
jelly donut the really pink one I really
like that color that's like Barbie pink
to me and I I enjoy my Barbie pink not
gonna lie so those are strawberry fig
and jelly donut from the to face melted
line really excited to try both now fig
and jelly doughnut I really like the way
that was watched on my hand so yay to
ulta and during i think it was in may
and i didn't find this out until like
the last two weeks of may but they were
having a special like every time that
you went to also a new placement order
you got a free hair care product every
thursday it wasn't every day it was
every thursday and i just happened to
stumble in there one thursday so then I
went back the next thursday in my free
hair that i got the two weeks that i was
able to make it in May and I was really
excited about it because this one is
that it's a 10 miracle leave-in and I
got the one for blondes of course but
I've heard a lot about this project and
so it says that
ten things that does instantly tones
hair enhances brilliance reduces bathing
and extends vibrancy add shine and
restores moisture restores elasticity
and strength detangle simdi frizzes
seals the cuticle as a thermal protector
a UV protector and designed for all
blondes I love this you guys I have been
using this like I would say I have maybe
a little bit more than half a bottle
left but it's just like the regular
spray top and I use it right when i get
out of the shower usually I would use
like a detangler on my hair I have one
from Victoria's Secret and then I have
one from another company that sent me to
review and I just kind of was going back
and forth between them but I started
trying this out and I haven't gone back
since I really do think it works I think
it smells good really like this one so
far and then the other free sample that
I got was this big sexy hair full bloom
and to be honest okay says this is a
long lasting thickening and refreshing
spray I have not used this yet because
when i was reading the directions
basically it's like so it's to give you
volume so after you get out of the
shower you would spray it like on your
roots and then you would use a blow
dryer to blow dry your hair and it would
activate this spray but i really don't
use a blow dryer at all I try to very
rarely use heat on my hair like
sometimes if we're going to a nice event
I will curl my hair but that's about all
I do I don't straighten my hair I I
can't remember the last time I used a
blow dryer I tend to try to keep Hot
Tools off my hair because it already is
so damaged I really don't need to help
the process any further so I have
actually not used this and I was my
hairdresser the other day and I was
telling her about the products that i
got and she mentioned that maybe I could
bring this in
next time I go to her because I don't
personally blow dry my hair at home but
when she does my hair obviously after
she highlights it then she washes it
blow dries it and then cuts it and
styled it for me so she's like bringing
it now I'll use it on you so you can see
what it's like I'm like okay so if you
guys have used this let me know what you
think and if you think it works okay the
next one that I got another just like
Alta trip it was my second trip that I
was like but would if i go i can get a
free hair care product like yes gotta go
get something and i was like i'm
actually almost out of my regular
moisturizer so why don't I just go get
some moisturizer and get over your hair
product so what I got is the Garnier
moisture rescue refreshing gel cream and
you guys this moisturizer I've been
using for years I mean it's when I run
out I don't get a new one this is what
it looks like and they have Gagne has
this green one and then they also have a
pink one which is what i'm using now and
i'm almost out of when i use up the
green one then i go back to the pink one
and i just kind of mix and match them
each time but I I love these they do say
that they are for like normal to
combination skin so I don't have like my
skin is normal my skin is not really dry
and it's not really oily so I am finding
this moisturizer to be perfect for me
two or three years and I've been using
this moisturizer and I love it so then I
went on a slight nail polish freak out
for a second and i will explain to you
why I freaked out i was watching Nicole
Guerrero's video I don't even I from
saying that right I was watching her
video and she mentioned the sally hansen
gel shine 3d topcoat and she's you know
she said like how amazing it was and how
well it works and i was like mmm okay
I'll go give it a try so I found this at
walgreens and it was either like 11 or
13 dollars like it was more expensive
I kind of like backed up like who do I
really want to do that but I decided to
just go with it and I am so happy I did
my nails you guys I never paint my nails
at home I barely own any nail polish
because I will paint my nails and then I
will take tektite boom nail polish is
screwed it's tripping off already it
doesn't last me a day I can't take a
shower with nail polish onyx like it out
and over half my nail polish is gone
it's like well why did I waste all that
time not only painting my nails but then
waiting for your nails to dry and you
can't do anything you're just like
around your house like this hey Bob this
and I tried it out and I wrote on my
social media like is it too soon to call
this a life changer because old my gosh
so what I did was you know paint my
nails like regular do the one to two
coats whatever it is you need to do let
it dry then I put this stuff on and it's
it like smooth out your nail polish so
especially because I'm right-handed my
left hand can sometimes just look like
super crazy like I don't even know it
just looks horrible but you put this on
and it's like it's like magic it just
like fixes your nails and I'm like what
how to do that and it makes them shiny
and it honestly makes it look like you
just went and got a gel manicure at the
salon it's incredible and then not only
that is my manicure will last like five
to seven days when i use this i can take
a shower and it's fine i can sneeze and
my nail polish doesn't fly off I mean
it's really incredible so then I found
this and was like but now I need nail
polish because I did not have a lot of
nail polish nail polishes and let's see
i bought these two i bought on amazon
and these are both from OPI this one is
don't bossa nova meet around and this
one is mod about you and modi about you
and these colors are so cute this pink
one is actually like a pretty bright
pink it's like it's not hot pink but
it's it's like a light pink
but bright it doesn't make any sense but
if I can find a picture that I'm wearing
it in I will like let you guys know or
if you follow me on instagram i'm
posting a lot of different nail polish
pictures so you can see what the
different polishes i look like and i'll
try to post one of this because i
thought it was a really unique color but
so pretty like it's not like an
in-your-face pink or a hot pink or
anything like that it's just like a
really good pink and then this one the
bossa nova me around this one was
another like just really interesting
color because it's not pink it's not
purple it's not gray it's like it's like
a mixture of all of those colors I don't
even know how to describe it like its
got like a grayish undertone but then a
little bit of light pink thrown in there
and I just thought it was a really great
neutral color for the summer and if you
know you don't want to be like too over
the top with your nail polish like maybe
you have a nice event that you're going
to and you don't want like your bright
pink or your bright coral or your green
or whatever it is that you're doing I
think this one is a really really good
option I also had to get some fun colors
to those are kind of like a more neutral
colors then I got these two just from
the sally hansen insta-dry line and this
one is in set sail and this one is in
leapin lilac and both of these colors I
think are so cute honestly I think they
kind of look like each other I got the
blue one first and i absolutely love
this color it reminds me a lot of like
that Cinderella blue that was really
popular like when the movie came out
just a few months ago and like make up
lines for doing full Cinderella lines
this blue was really really popular and
that's a lot of what it reminds me of
but then honestly I bought this one a
few weeks later probably and I put it on
and I was like hmm it almost kind of
looks like the blue so I try to put a
few more coats on so you can tell it's
more of a purple color but hmm you might
only need one of these if you're trying
to choose and I
I would do this as sales because I love
this color yeah we're almost done so
this was also a repurchase but I wanted
to tell you guys about it this is from
the Maybelline New York unstoppable line
and it's just an eyeliner killer
eyeliner like this are these in sapphire
this is the only color I've ever bought
from the sign but I absolutely love it I
love being able to put a little blue in
my waterline I think it just can like
totally change up a look but very subtly
sometimes if I do just like a very
neutral I I will actually just smudge a
little bit of blue on my upper lash line
and kind of smudge it out a little bit
it's different if you don't only want
like black or brown and your eyeliner
collection this is just a really pretty
dark blue I've had this eyeliner in my
collection always since when I went to
college and I'm celebrating my 10-year
high school reunion this year so if that
tells you how old I am then I just have
a few lip products to talk about the
first one is from wet and wild and this
is called oh it's not on here I think
this one is called like bear at all and
that's it right there that kind of
thinks that it's not on the packaging it
must be like on the wrapper and then
when you take the wrapper off that's
gone but I'm pretty sure this one is
called bear at all and it's by wet and
wild I watched kathleenlights video and
she did like Mac dupes and she said this
was a dupe for Mac velvet teddy and I've
wanted Mac velvet teddy for a really
long time so when she said this was a
dupe max lipsticks are like sixteen
dollars this was a dollar ninety-nine at
walgreens like I mean just like why not
and I actually really love the color
it's it actually shows more pink on my
hand when I swatch it but it's just like
a very nice nude color but with just
maybe a little hint of pink and honestly
I almost thought there was like a hint
of orange in it when I put it on my lips
but I think it's beautiful the only
thing I don't love about the lipsticks
is that they
go down so like yeah you can go up but
you can't go down so when you put it in
you have to be careful because I wasn't
one time and I got lipstick all up in
the cab so I final two lip products I
got these both from walgreens there a
lip liner in a lipstick and they're
actually both what I'm wearing on my
lips today this lip liner is Sedona Red
and it's by jordana and today was the
first time I'm using it that's the lip
liner right here and it is red but it's
almost more like of on the pinkish red
side but it was very easy to line my
lips like maybe you almost a little bit
too easy i started to line up and i'm
used to like my mac pencil where you
kind of depressed a little bit no no not
with this one it came out just fine pair
it with this L'Oreal Paris collection
exclusive lipstick and this is the color
and this is blake so i also have this
like same packaging the l'oreal
collection this is their nudes
collection and i have J Lo's nude and
like look at that it's been one of my
favorite lipsticks and I saw that they
put out a collection of Reds that Blake
Lively had a lipstick and I don't know
about you but I'm like a hardcore blake
lively playing like dude but so i was
like oh my gosh i need to get this and
then i realized that the collection
actually came out like towards christmas
time and my walgreens that i found this
at just like apparently had a few left
and they're actually running a special
price promotion on them to get rid of
them and i didn't realize that until i
left came home looked up the collection
realized what it was and that basically
once walgreens sold these they were
going to be gone and then I got up and
left again and went back to walgreens
just so i could buy this that's so
serious it was about behind this
lipstick but i think this is really
gorgeous i talked about in my drawer
cosmetics video that i was looking for
just like a deep like pure red color and
my one from Gerard cosmetics
I our engine I didn't think quite did it
it was more like the pink red side to me
and when I put this on just a few
minutes ago I was like yes this is what
I was looking for I love it I actually
think on camera it's turning out more of
like the reddish orange but in person I
don't see any orange at all I just see
red so I thought that was interesting
once i was looking at some of the
earlier play box and I was like that
kind of looks a little bit on the orange
side but oh I just know this is going to
be like my go-to red lipstick and
especially with that Jordana liner I
think they will make a really good pair
and I don't know if you'll be able to
get this anywhere at all anymore but if
you see any places selling the l'oreal
Reds collection just know that it's like
a special edition collection so go ahead
and snatch w can so those are all my
items of my big haul I hope you enjoyed
it i know that was probably a lot for
you guys and hopefully this video isn't
going to be too long but i wanted to
