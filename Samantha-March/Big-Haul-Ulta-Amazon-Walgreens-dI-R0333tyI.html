going to be doing like three halls and
one for you I recently purchased a few
things from Ulta Walgreens and I did an
Amazon order as well I kind of put
everything that I've been getting into
my Ulta bag because yeah I thought it
would make it easier for me so I've just
kind of like throwing things in here as
I get them so I remember to talk about
them so let's just get into it
because this is like the biggest item in
here first I have this Garnier fruity
style sky high volume mousse and it says
it's a 24 hour high volume and hold
extreme and the scent is apparently
common flower mmm I can't really smell
anything yet but I haven't actually used
it at all
but I use the mousse a lot I would say
but days where I'm just kind of like
feeling rushed I don't have a lot of
time to spend in the shower like a
shampooing and conditioning my hair and
then I don't have time to like wait for
it to dry and straighten what I will do
is I will only shampoo my hair and then
I'll skip the conditioner and I'll get
out and I will just run most through my
hair and I like scrunch it and then I
get like these I mean they're not curls
and they're not waves but they're just
kind of like really like beachy hair
with a little oomph and that lasts me
for like three days and simply all I
have is shampoo and mousse in it I don't
use anything else
so those days where it's like oh I have
no choice I use mousse I'm just running
out of what I have now so I picked this
one up as a backup for when I do run out
but this is such like a bag of goodies
like I'm trying not to look next up I
purchased these from Amazon they are the
bedhead urban antidotes resurrection
shampoo and conditioner and I got these
I saw luster Lux talked about them
and she mentioned that she's been using
these for like years or something like
that and I was like okay okay I feel
like I never really hear someone like
yes I've used the same shampoo and
conditioner for years like I'm
constantly switching on my shampoo and
conditioner trying to find one that I
really really love recently I've been
using like the kenra volumizing shampoo
and conditioner and I liked it a lot I
wouldn't say I was like I can't live
without this shampoo and conditioners so
I heard Lester Lux talk about it and
then there was one other youtuber that I
saw mentioned us and I was like okay now
then two people have said it like I'm
definitely gonna give it a try but it
seems pretty interesting they actually
had so they have like the number three
on it I think they had one two and three
and each one kind of did a different
thing but I got three because it says
it's for damage level 3 meaning you have
really damaged hair and I was like yes
that's me says the girl who just
highlighted her hair four days ago
like oh I'm really excited to give this
a try I'm not quite done with my kinder
shampoo and conditioner so I'm gonna
wait until I finish that out and then I
will give this a shot
have some samples to show you guys this
was from my purchase on Ulta oh yeah
because I did I did technically two
different all the purchases one I did in
store and one I did online so my on line
one
I bought some two-faced lipsticks and it
came with a sample of the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer and I'm really
excited to try this I haven't tried it
yet you open this thing boom that's what
the bronzer looks like and I've heard
really good things
I actually just posted a picture on my
Instagram I have a new Instagram account
called March books beauty and it's
simply for chocolate plus I've never had
an Instagram oh it really smells like
chocolate I've never had an Instagram
account just for that like I've had my
personal Instagram account and
my real name and then I have a Fitness
Instagram account but I just never
really got one for my blog I don't know
why but I finally did it so you guys can
follow me there if you wanted it's down
in the description box under my social
media info but I posted one of this and
I had several people commenting like
bronzer is life that's all I use my cool
I don't know if it's likes watching on
my hand very well I don't know if you
guys can see that but oh maybe you can
but it's so it's medium deep matte
bronzer that's kind of fun I'm really
excited to give that one a try and I
also got so when you put an order in
through Ulta online you get to pick like
a sampler pack and I think there's like
a fragrance pack a face pack in a beauty
pack or something like that but I did
the face one and so what they sent me
was the Porefessional from benefit they
were Porefessional I guess is what they
call it but it says it's a pro balm to
minimize the appearance of pores I've
heard really good things about this it
says it's silky oil-free quickly
minimizes the appearance of pores and
fine lines for smoother than smooth skin
and you use it under your makeup so I'll
give that it's just this little sample
right here a shot and then I also got
the Smashbox photo finish foundation
primer so again I've heard pretty good
things about all the Smashbox primers
they have so many of them so curious to
give this one a try the thing that I
don't really love about ordering from
Ulta online and the samples that you get
is that you don't actually know what
you're getting whereas when you order
from Sephora online you get to pick
three free samples plus a free deluxe
sized sample and you get to pick them so
you know what you're getting so I'm just
glad I don't have either of these and
I've never tried them so I'm excited to
try something new but it's like what if
you get two things that you already have
then you're like oh cool I did it I
bought some of the Too Faced melted
lipstick
I got um I got some I did it so I got
these from Ulta and now I can't remember
how much they were but they're pretty
expensive for lipsticks like let's be
serious but they were having a deal like
if you purchased $35 or something of Too
Faced you've got the free bronzer sample
and I was like okay I have heard so many
good things about them and these head
they've had so many fun colors
especially for summer that I was like I
just really want them so this is what
they look like I love the packaging
they're so cute I got just on three and
the regular one just like the regular
melted not the metallic melted cuz I'm
not a huge fan of like metallic lips if
that makes sense but I got strawberry
melted jelly doughnut and fake melted
face so they're all the melted ones and
I I just have been really excited I did
use strawberry I just could not wait to
use this one and so that's strawberry
and I don't know once again to me I
thought it came out more pink than red
and I had to like apply it a few times
to really get the red in there like
mommy's a lot out on to my hand and I
don't know do you guys think that looks
more red now so I was like I had to keep
adding coats and I wore this when I went
to a concert and at one point my friend
was like um your lipstick is like down
here like it really did bleed a lot
outside my lips I didn't have a lip
liner on and so I was like okay duly
noted like they're really really
long-lasting but again and I don't know
if that this is just because I wanted
that red lip look but I felt like I did
have to keep applying it to make sure I
was getting that read like yes the
lipstick was staying on but it was like
fading to that pink color and I was like
no but I want red so I kept putting it
on a lot and I think you really need a
lip liner maybe just with like the
darker colors but it was kind of like
feathering outside of my lips so that
was strawberry and I had
not use I just got these ones so I have
not used these ones yet but this is big
different color for me so the purple one
that's big and I don't really have any
like
purple-ish lipstick and so I just
thought that would this would be a
really fun color I watched a lot of
youtubers like lip swatch videos and fig
each time was one that I was like that
looks interesting
I kind of like that so we'll see it
swatches really well on my hand so I
like that and then this one is the jelly
donut and if you guys can see like this
is what the applicator looks like so
it's just all white and it's like soft
what the applicator looks like if you're
wondering oh this is like really pink I
like this a lot so this is the jelly
donut a really pink one I really like
that color that's like Barbie pink to me
and I I enjoyed my Barbie pink not gonna
lie so those are strawberry fig and
jelly donut from the Too Faced melted
line really excited to try both now fig
and jelly donut I really like the way
that I was watched on my hand so yay to
Ulta and during I think it was in May
and I didn't find this out until like
the last two weeks of May but they were
having a special like every time that
you went to Ulta and you placed an order
you got a free haircare product every
Thursday it wasn't everyday it was every
Thursday and I just happened to stumble
in there one Thursday so then I went
back the next Thursday and my free hair
that I got the two weeks that I was able
to make it in May and I was really
excited about it because this one is
that it's a 10 miracle leave-in and I
got the one for blondes of course but
I've heard a lot about this product and
so it says the 10 things it does and
gently tones hair enhances brilliance
reduces fading and extends vibrancy add
shine and restores moisture restores
elasticity and strength detangle sandy
frizzes seals the cuticle as a thermal
protector a UV protector and designed
for all blondes I love this you guys I
have been using this like I would say I
have maybe a little bit more than half a
bottle left but it's just like the
regular spray top and I use it right
when I get out of the shower usually I
would use like a detangler on my hair I
have one from Victoria's Secret and then
I have one from another company that
sent me to review and I just kind of was
going back and forth between them but I
started trying this out and I haven't
gone back since I really do think it
works I think it smells good really like
this one so far and then the other free
sample that I got was this big sexy hair
full bloom and to be honest ok says this
is a long lasting thickening and
refreshing spray I have not used this
yet because when I was reading the
directions basically it's like so it's
to give you volume so after you get out
of the shower you would spray it like on
your roots and then you would use a blow
dryer to blow dry your hair and it would
activate this spray but I really don't
use a blow dryer at all I try to very
rarely use heat on my hair like
sometimes if we're going to a nice event
I will curl my hair but that's about all
I do I don't straighten my hair I I
can't remember the last time I used a
blow dryer I tend to try to keep Hot
Tools off my hair because it already is
so damaged I really don't need to help
the process any further so I have
actually not used this and I was my
hairdresser the other day and I was
telling her about the products that I
got and she mentioned that maybe I could
bring this in
next time I go toward her because I
don't personally blow joy my hair at
home but when she does my hair obviously
after she highlights it then she washes
it blow dries it and then cuts it and
styles it for me so she's like bringing
it now I'll use it on you and you so you
can see what it's like I'm like okay so
if you guys have used this let me know
what you think and if you think it works
okay
the next one that I got another just
like Ulta trip it was my second trip
that I was like but what if I go I can
get a free haircare product like yes
gotta go get something and I was like
I'm actually almost out
I'm my regular moisturizer so why don't
I just go get some moisturizer and get
her for a hair product so what I got is
the Garnier moisture rescue refreshing
gel cream and you guys this moisturizer
I've been using for years
I mean it's when I run out I don't get a
new one this is what it looks like and
they have Garnier has this green one and
then they also have a pink one which is
what I'm using now and I'm almost out of
when I use up the green one then I go
back to the pink one and I just kind of
mix and match them each time but I
I love these they do say that they are
for like normal to combination skin so I
don't have like my skin is normal my
skin is not really dry and it's not
really oily so I am finding this
moisturizer to be perfect for me two or
three years and I've been using this
moisturizer and I love it so then I went
on a slight nail-polish
freakout for a second and I will explain
to you why I freaked out I was watching
Nicole Guerrero's video I don't even
know if I'm saying that right
I was watching her video and she
mentioned the Sally Hansen gel shine 3d
topcoat and she's you know she said like
how amazing it was and how well it works
and I was like mmhmm okay I'll go give
it a try so I found this at Walgreens
and it was either like 11 or 13 dollars
like it was more expensive and
I kind of like backed up like who do I
really want to do that but I decided to
just go with it and I am so happy I did
my nails you guys I never paint my nails
at home I barely own any nail polish
because I will paint my nails and then I
will take tektite boom nail polish is
screwed it's chipping off already it
doesn't last me a day I can't take a
shower with nail polish on because I get
out and over to half my nail polish is
gone it's like well why did I waste all
that time not only painting my nails but
then waiting for your nails to dry and
you can't do anything you're just like
around your house like this hey not this
and I tried it out and I wrote on my
social media like is it too soon to call
this a life changer because oh my gosh
so what I did was you know paint my
nails like regular do the one to two
coats whatever it is you need to do let
it dry then I put this stuff on and it's
it like smooths out your nail polish so
especially because I'm right-handed my
left hand can sometimes just look like
super crazy like I don't even know it
just looks horrible but you put this on
and it's like it's like magic it just
like fixes near nails and I'm like how
to do that and it makes them shiny and
it honestly makes it look like you just
went and got a gel manicure at the salon
it's incredible and then not only that
is my manicure will last like five to
seven days when I use this I can take a
shower and it's fine I can sneeze and my
nail polish doesn't fly off I mean it's
really incredible so then I found this
and was like but now I need nail polish
because I did not have a lot of nail
polish the nail polishes and let's see I
bought these two I bought on Amazon and
these are both from OPI this one is
don't bossanova me around and this one
is mod about you and MODY about you and
these colors are so cute this pink one
it's actually like a pretty bright pink
it's like it's not hot pink but it's
it's like a light pink
but right it doesn't make any sense but
I can find a picture that I'm wearing it
in I will like let you guys know or if
you follow me on Instagram I'm posting a
lot of different nail polish pictures so
you can see what the different polishes
I look like and I'll try to post one of
this because I thought it was a really
unique color but so pretty like it's not
like an in-your-face pink or a hot pink
or anything like that it's just like a
really good pink and then this one the
bossa nova me around and this one was
another like just really interesting
color because it's not pink it's not
purple it's not grey it's like it's like
a mixture all over those colors I don't
even know how to describe it like it's
got like a grayish undertone but then a
little bit of light pink thrown in there
and I just thought it was a really great
neutral color for the summer and if you
know you don't want to be like too
over-the-top with your nail polish like
maybe you have a nice event that you're
going to and you don't want like your
bright pink or your bright coral or your
green or whatever it is that you're
doing I think this one is a really
really good option I also had to get
some fun colors too those are kind of
like my more neutral colors then I got
these two just from the sailing Hansen
insta-dry line and this one is in set
sail and this one is in leaping lilac
and both of these colors I think are so
cute honestly I think they kind of look
like each other I got the blue one first
and I absolutely love this color it
reminds me a lot of like that Cinderella
blue that was really popular like when
the movie came out just a few months ago
and like makeup lines for doing full
Cinderella lines this blue was really
really popular and that's a lot of what
it reminds me of but then honestly I
bought this one a few weeks later
probably and I put it on and I was like
hmm it almost kind of looks like the
blue so I tried to put a few more coats
on so you can tell it's more of a purple
color but hmm you might only need one of
these if you're trying to choose and I
I would do this on sale because I love
this color and we're almost done so this
was also a repurchase but I wanted to
tell you guys about it this is from the
Maybelline New York unstoppable line and
it's just an eyeliner killer eyeliner
like this buy these in sapphire this is
the only color I've ever bought from
this line but I absolutely love it I
love being able to put a little blue in
my waterline I think it just can like
totally change up a look but very subtly
sometimes if I do just like a very
neutral eye I will actually just smudge
a little bit of blue on my upper lash
line and kind of smudge it out a little
bit it's different if you don't only
want like black or brown and your
eyeliner collection this is just a
really pretty dark blue I've had this
eyeliner in my collection always since
when I went to college and I'm
celebrating my 10-year high school
reunion this year so if that tells you
how old I am then I just have a few lip
products to talk about the first one is
from Wet n Wild and this is called oh
it's not on here I think this one is
called like bear at all and that's it
right there
that kinda stinks that it's known on the
packaging it must be like on the wrapper
and then when you take the wrapper off
abscond but I'm pretty sure this one is
called bear Adal and it's by wet and
wild
I watched kathleenlights video and she
did like Mac dupes and she said this was
a dupe for Mac velvet teddy and I have
won it Mac velvet teddy for a really
long time so when she said this was a
dupe Mac's lipsticks are like 16 dollars
this was a dollar ninety-nine at
Walgreens like I mean just like why not
and I actually really love the color
it's it actually shows more pink on my
hand when I swatch it but it's just like
a very nice nude color but with just
maybe a little hint of pink and honestly
I almost thought there was like a hint
of orange in it when I put it on my lips
but I think it's beautiful the only
thing I don't love about the lipsticks
is that they
go down so like yeah you can go up but
you can't go down so when you put it in
you have to be careful because I wasn't
one time and I got lipstick all up in
the cab so I final two lip products I
got these both from Walgreens they're a
lipliner and a lipstick and they're
actually both what I'm wearing on my
lips today this lip liner is sedona red
and it's by Jordana and today was the
first time I'm using it
that's the lip liner right here and it
is red but it's almost more like on the
pinkish red side but it was very easy to
line my lips like maybe almost a little
bit too easy I started to line them and
I'm used to like my Mac pencil where you
kind of depress a little bit no no not
with this one it came out just fine pair
it with this L'Oreal Paris collection
exclusive lipstick and this is the color
and this is Blake so I also have this
like same packaging the L'Oreal
collection this is their nudes
collection and I have J Lo's nude and
like look at that it's been one of my
favorite lipsticks and I saw that they
put out a collection of Reds not Blake
Lively had a lipstick and I don't know
about you but I'm like a hardcore Blake
Lively playing like dude but so I was
like oh my gosh I need to get this and
then I realized that the collection that
actually came out like towards Christmas
time and my Walgreens that I found this
at just like apparently had a few left
and they're actually running a special
price promotion on them to get rid of
them and I didn't realize that until I
left came home looked up the collection
realized what it was and that basically
a once Walgreens sold these they were
going to be gone and then I got up and
left again and went back to Walgreens
just so I could buy this that's so
serious it was about behind those
lipstick but I think this is really
gorgeous I talked about in my Gerard
cosmetics video that I was looking for
just like a deep like pure red color and
my one from Gerard cosmetics
by our engine I didn't think quite did
it it was more than like the pink red
side to me
and when I put this on just a few
minutes ago I was like yes this is what
I was looking for I love it I actually
think on camera it's turning out more of
like the reddish orange but in person I
don't see any orange at all I just see
red so I thought that was interesting
once I was looking at some of the
earlier play box and I was like that I
know looks a little bit on the orange
side but oh I just know this is gonna be
like my go-to red lipstick and
especially with that Jordana liner I
think they will make a really good pair
and so I don't know if you'll be able to
get this anywhere at all anymore but if
you see any places selling the L'Oreal
Reds collection just know that it's like
a special edition collection so go ahead
and snatch it up while you can
so those are all my items of my big haul
I hope you enjoyed it I know that was
probably a lot for you guys and
hopefully this video isn't gonna be too
long but I wanted to share with you
