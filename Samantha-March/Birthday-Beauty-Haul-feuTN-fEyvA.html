channel so I'm very excited for today's
video because it's going to be a haul
video but not just any haul video this
is going to be my birthday haul video so
my birthday was on march twenty third
and i actually had put myself on a know
by like a month or so before my birthday
because i was like you are hauling way
too much and not only is your birthday
coming up you'll probably be getting
some makeup and beauty products from
friends and family and i was like an
gift cards you know so you can buy your
own things and then of course you know
you have to buy yourself a few little
birthday presents in there too am i
right but also this is for vib sale is
coming up Austin's 21 days of beauty was
just here so I'm like whoa let's just
chill out calm down hang out till your
birthday and then go ahead and buy a few
things and so I'm so excited to share my
birthday haul with you I have gifts that
was sent to me I have some items that i
purchased through the gift cards or
money that i received i have a
big-ticket item that I'm very excited to
share with you guys but also i have a
few like free gifts from like sephora
and alta if you're a part of their like
loyalty program you get free birthday
gifts which is very cool so i will go
over it those as well yeah very excited
to share my birthday haul with you I
felt so much love on my birthday like it
wasn't like it it was insane it left me
speechless I felt so much love I just 29
is going to be a great year and I
absolutely cannot wait to see what is in
store for me this year but before I get
all like choked up and emotional and
crazy let's just have a few items from
my mom that I wanted to share with you
guys my mom ha I just love my mom she
showed me so much love on my birthday so
not only did she send me all these like
lovely presents and we gotta talk on my
birthday but she also made it a point to
tell me how proud of me that she was and
that's such a special thing me to hear
from a parent um so I love my mom she's
awesome I'm really excited to share all
these goodies with you but first I was
super super super excited because she
sent me the carli bybel palette that
we collaborated with BH Cosmetics with
it is an eye shadow and highlight
palette so this is what it looks like
sorry this mirror here we go okay there
we go so these are what it looks like I
do have a few like close-up shades on my
Instagram as well I also did a birthday
bronze to make up tutorial using this
palette I love it so far there are a few
shades that are kind of powdery like
they kind of kick up a lot of powder but
nothing on the extreme side i have owned
several pallets from BH Cosmetics and
this by far is is such a better quality
than I have seen from them so I was
really really impressed with this
especially the highlight shades they are
so stunning I find myself wearing them
all the time very impressed with this
palette it's super super affordable it's
like 1250 or something on the
bhcosmetics website so if you haven't
grabbed it I give it a go so also very
excited because she sent me a pair of
eyelashes from house of lashes and are
actually the ones i am wearing today
they are in the style heartbreaker and
she also sent to me the adhesive from
house of lashes as well it's just their
black adhesive add the heartbreaker
lashes I chose these ones it was a tough
choice between heartbreaker and the
Iconix that everyone talks about but I
was drawn to the Heartbreakers because
they are so wispy they are very long but
very wispy so they're not like boom in
your face like the ardell double ups
that I wore in my last makeup tutorial
they're more on the natural side I mean
I'm not going to say they're natural
because they're false lashes and it
looks like you're wearing false lashes
but they're not totally in your face
they also reminded me a lot of the
Samantha lashes from hooter beauty and
I've actually been like struggling with
those lashes so hard I've warned him
twice and I can barely wear him anymore
but I love the style of them and so
that's why when I was choosing a pair I
was like I gotta go with heartbreaker
and I am so happy with them you guys
they are beautiful they are so stunning
I love wispy lashes the adhesive so I've
heard a lot of people talk about house
of lashes and not being able to get
their lash glue
at least I thought it was house of
lashes and I noticed they have glue and
adhesive on their website i bought the
head I asked for the adhesive versus the
glue because in my time with putting
eyelashes on I have found glue just does
not work for me so I always buy adhesive
and actually like I didn't have trouble
getting this off like it's not that it
doesn't make the eyelashes stay because
it does but people are saying like at
the end of the night when you're trying
to pull up your lashes it's like nearly
impossible with the house of lashes and
so I'm thinking that must be the glue
and not the adhesive because even though
yes it makes your lashes stay I was
still able to get him off just fine at
the end of the night so I don't that's
my little mini review of that but yes
house of lashes heartbreaker and the
adhesive so happy and then the last
thing makeup-wise that she got me I got
a few few other things including a
really cute tank top that I was actually
gonna wear today oh oh I haven't watched
it yet that's what I was like why did I
wear that tanked up gotta wash it first
my been have done laundering a few days
oops but the last makeup thing that she
sent me a word to Milani I shadows and I
was super excited these are there what
do they come The Bella eyes gel powder
eyeshadow and I have had my eyes on
these eyeshadows for for sure for at
least a year and for some reason like
I've just been like I don't know if I'm
too scared to buy them or what but I see
people using them in the tutorials and
I'm like what am I waiting for I
actually don't own a lot of Milani and I
feel like that's probably what it is I'm
not super familiar with the brand so I'm
very brand loyal so the eyeshadows that
I do by are usually from the same
companies over and over again but I was
really excited that she sent me these
Milani shadow so I can try them out she
got me the shades espresso which is a
brown and then she also and it's a matte
shade these are both Matt and then also
i've read so that is the ivory shade i
have used them both I think they're
amazing I want more of these now and I
know they smell my CVS i feel like i'm
going to pick a few up but they are so
smooth going on the eyes and actually
what
I did is I put this in like my outer V
and kind of blended it in words and then
I used this just all over my lid blended
the two together and it was perfection I
loved it so thank you mom so much from I
guess I love you so one thing that I do
want to talk about that I bought for
myself for my birthday and I'm so
excited for I finally purchased a new
camera I did talk about this on like my
snapchat I know I mentioned it in my
last video that I was filming with a new
camera i bought the sony a 5100 camera
um it's the camera that i hear a lot of
youtubers and beauty vlogger is talking
about the reason i decided to go with a
51 is because even though i hear it's
good for filming but not great for
filming but it's great for taking makeup
and product photos my phone films videos
it just fine I've never had a problem
filming videos on my phone but it does
not take good product photos and it does
not take good makeup photos so I thought
do I want to get a camera good for
filming or would I rather get a camera
good for taking those photos I wanted
the photos that's why I went with a 5100
this is going to be the second not this
is going to be the third video that i am
recording on this and i think the
quality is coming out just fine I feel
like I need to mess with the lighting a
little bit especially when I use the
zoom feature I feel like I'm losing some
of the brightness but i'm still learning
so please bear with me as i watch
tutorials and ask questions and try to
figure out all the settings that i need
to adjust and that sort of thing and the
only downside really that I'm seeing
right now filming with this camera is
that it gets like the internal
temperature gets too hot very quickly
and the camera will shut down and did do
that when I was filming my last to make
up tutorial and I needed to wait about
10 minutes turn the camera back on and
then could keep filming so especially
for longer videos it's probably not
great and now i'm filming a hole on it
but I just I'm trying to get more
comfortable using it and editing with it
because then editing is
little bit different using the camera as
well but i'm just i'm very excited I'm
so happy to finally have a nice camera
especially to make just the quality of
my photos turn out better I'm really
excited to be stepping up my game it's
been almost a one-year here on YouTube
and between it being my almost my
one-year and my birthday I was like what
a good present to buy for myself camera
so happy I got it also got it on sale
saved two hundred dollars that's a good
day so I also picked up myself some
goodies from Tarte um so actually this
is kind of a fun story but a few weeks
ago tart reposted one of my photos on
their Instagram and it was using that
one of the new lipsticks that i bought
from them so tart is like my new best
friend right now they are the first like
major beauty brand or an account to post
to repost me and like I cried and I was
like telling everybody on snapchat and
it was so sweet like reading the
comments even on the tart website like
people were tagging me like smooth March
lug this happened and I'm so proud for
you and I'm so happy for you I was like
oh my gosh thanks guys like it's such a
small thing I know that I'm sure there's
people out there they're like rolling
their eyes like seriously you are not
cool and not think not that I'm thinking
I'm like queen bee but it was just
something very cool that happened and
pretty cool that target was the first
one to do it feel like tarts always
going to hold like special place in my
heart now but i really enjoy the lip
paints from them i have one in TBT and I
wanted to get another one because I
really like them and the shade I decided
to go with is self-etch and it is just
like a super super bright pink color I
do have up clothes watches on my
Instagram and I also wore it in my
skincare routine video but it is a
bright pink like this is spring and
summer ready but i love the TARDIS
clippings i want to buy more I loved
heart now even more than I did before
but yeah so fetch if I didn't say the
name did I say the name so fetch I also
picked up some of their Brazilians skin
rejuvenating Mary kuja self-tanning
bass tablets that is a mouthful but
basically what they are is just a
self-tanner pad for your face so it
comes in just like this little guy right
here it's just a little square pad you
just rub it all over your face and it's
supposed to be a self tanner
specifically designed for your face I
saw luster luxe talking about these
quite a bit and so I decided to go for
it they were on sale when I got it I got
a pack of 10 for it was like ten dollars
or something like that maybe they're
normally like 15 I got for 10 or
something and then with the order I got
a free one is like you know you're like
a little bonus gift or whatnot I got
another one so I got 11 i have used 393
right now and i'm just using one a week
because i want it to be like a gradual
tan I'm not looking to be like super tan
for any reason right now so I'm
gradually building up the tan but there
is a difference that I'm seeing and I am
loving it I use the tantowels right now
at hand the rest of my body but because
i only use one tan towel for my whole
body by the time i get to my face I
don't really want to use it I brought
the towel on my body there's probably
not a product a lot of product left so
usually just leave my face alone and you
know because I wash my face and
exfoliate my face up watch oh my god no
big deal just use bronzer or whatever to
try to color match my face to the rest
of my body but when i saw that these
were specifically for your face i was
like i'm gonna give them a world and so
far i'm really impressed with them I do
have sensitive skin they haven't broken
me out and to go over what i got from
sephora and alta if you are now to part
us before and Altos loyalty program I
definitely suggest you do it both of
them are free basically you just get
points when you make purchases like for
altos you can redeem your points for
cash and for Sephora you can redeem them
for products and it's a really good deal
I suggest in both and if you are part of
their loyalty program you enter your
birthday in there and so then you get
free products around your birthday so
first before you were able to choose
from two different gift sets one from
fresh beauty which was skincare and then
one from marc jacobs and it was a
lipstick and maybe like an eyeliner i'm
totally on a skincare kick right now and
i love fresh beauty so I just
to go with the fresh set the fresh soy
face cleanser which looks like this I
have to add a few samples of it and I
really enjoy it and then this one was
new to me it's their rose face mask so a
little guy of that one I have used this
probably two or three times and I have
really been enjoying it so far so I was
really trying to hold out for using
these until I filmed this hall and then
I was like girl now I'm not waiting any
longer so I had to dip into the row
space masks and i really like it was
very gentle on the skin it kind of had a
little bit of a funky sent to it but
gentle on the skin I thought didn't
break me out and yeah I'll keep using
these then for alta i got an email and
it said for your birthday your free gift
is from benefit and it is a little
sample size of their rollerball mascara
Joe is really excited because I have not
tried this mascara yet and I have been
wanting to I haven't opened it yet so
let me see if I can actually get this
open and then you also I think you've
got like double points at Alta as well
for anything that you purchased during
your birthday month which I thought was
pretty cool but here is the little guy
of the roller lash so super excited to
try this want to get it through a few of
my other little sample mascaras before I
open this bad boy up but I feel like it
won't be long because I've Martin to try
this for so long but it was also pretty
nice to get the double points during my
birthday month because my birthday month
also happened to fall under the 21 days
of beauty at Alta now I actually was not
familiar with Aldous 21 days of beauty
until right around the time it started
but basically it's every day there was
like one two or three products that were
on sale and these included high end
products which usually at Alta high-end
doesn't go on sale and your coupon like
your 350 off or ten percent off doesn't
work on the high end side of Alta and so
when I was seeing these products that
were going on sale and going on sale for
like decent amounts I was like yes
please so I went in there one day to get
my free mascara but also the day I went
in it was because the Mario Badescu line
was
five percent off which I thought was
pretty awesome I've been hearing a lot
about Mario Badescu I've been really
wanting to try them out one thing I got
is the facial spray with a low herbs and
rosewater and I'm getting pretty down
there on my mac fix+ and I have another
spray it's from victoria secret i
honestly don't think it does anything so
i wanted to find one to replace that one
and probably just throw that one away
because I don't really think it does
much but really excited to try this
haven't tried it out like literally just
bought this but so excited to try it the
other thing i bought from him was the
drying lotion a ton of people are
talking about this drying lotion desi
Perkins is talking about it Kylie Jenner
was on snapchat the other night talking
about it basically what people are using
this floor is putting it on breakouts
like when you get your breakout you're
supposed to put this on there and it
acts as basically like a pimple cream
and so I'm going to try it because when
I do get breakouts which thankfully
isn't super often but when I do they are
usually like big and like Queens I mean
they're just Queens so I'm hoping if I
put this on it I'll shrink them down and
attack them but it's also a really cute
little like glass bottle probably not
good to travel with but very excited to
try the Mario Badescu aligned and I
actually posted about it and the Mario
Badescu account like responded on my
picture and was like hey thanks for
trying us I was like the you're welcome
also the day that I went in they were
having one of the tart mascaras was on
sale is normally a $21 mascara I got a
full size for ten believe it was the
lights camera lashes and you'll see that
in a giveaway coming soon if you want a
hint I would say go follow me on
instagram and see what happens and a few
more things that i picked up for myself
i got these at the drugstore well i got
them at target technically got them at
target but i actually have it on my eyes
right now and it is the new wet'n'wild
pressed glitters i got the gold and the
silver they were the only two I could
find I couldn't find him at CBS and
target had these two colors and so I
decided to grab them and give them a try
because I've been seeing it making the
rounds on the social media outlets and
everyone is like going crazy right now
worthy pressed glitter pigments glitter
injection pigments and now I'm here like
some funky feedback from him so I'm kind
of glad I didn't order from him yet
because there's some like weird things
happening right now but those are like
twelve or thirteen dollars apiece and
these were ninety-four cents like
ninety-four cents they were like
ninety-nine cents and then on cartwheel
there were 90 for son so I was like okay
so I picked him up I put up a gerbil on
Instagram and asked if anyone use them
and the feedback was mostly negative
like there was some people that were
like yeah I think they're great they're
awesome but honestly the feedback was
mostly negative and I was like okay I'm
a little bit nervous i think i am going
to do a full video on these and also a
few other new drug store items i'm
thinking of doing like a new at the
drugstore almost like a buyer by or hit
or miss type of video so if there's
anything else that's new at the
drugstore that you guys are interested
in seeing a review on please let me know
because i'm going to go pick up a few
more things so i'm going to do a full
review in that video um I do have him on
my eyes today like I said it was very
easy to apply so far I've only had this
makeup on for about an hour I haven't
seen any creasing yet it was easy to put
my eyeliner and my lashes on but you
know obviously it's only been an hour I
need to see how it wears and you to see
if it creases a lot of people are saying
it creases really bad there wasn't a
whole lot of fallout there is a little
bit especially around my inner corners
so if I look kind of like a unicorn you
know that slot impressions honestly was
pretty good but of course I'll need to
see how they last throughout the day so
check back for a new video coming soon
so if you guys watched one of my recent
videos i did a video all about my nails
and how i have found the brand nail her
and have been loving on my fake nails my
press-on nails these are the nails i
have on right now so i do have a whole
video dedicated to nail her and
explaining about the nails etc if you
want to watch that i can leave it linked
down below but i went ahead and ordered
three more pairs for myself because i
really enjoyed the first pair that i got
so i got three more the first one I got
is Nagy and I got this in
squall leto so the squall leto is like
almost comes to a stiletto like almost
comes to that tip but then it is
actually square at the end these nails I
did not think I would really like them
but I actually really do I will say they
are hard to type with I've been really
trying to get used to typing with them
because I type all day long it is a
little bit hard especially the first day
I was like I felt like I was learning
typing again like doing the one finger
thing I've had these on for like four
days now I think and it's going much
smoother but still a little bit hard to
get used to because if you can see they
are like pretty long but I don't know I
actually really do like them I don't
think I could ever have these nails like
forever like yeah I can wear them for a
week and then take them off but click
kudos to the chicks you can have these
guys forever nails because I don't know
how you go through life it's pretty
crazy another set i got is in marble and
these are oval so the tips are just an
oval really excited to try these i
thought these were very cute I'm kind of
mad because I did open them and like
kind of size him because I thought I was
going to wear next and then I do have a
giveaway coming up like I said I might
want to follow me on instagram because
something might be coming soon and i
think i'm going to give away a set of
nail her nails and I thought about doing
these ones and then I realized I opened
them so I can't do that but next time I
place an order I might do another one in
there for a giveaway and then the last
set i bought is in wonderland and these
are the stilettos so these do come to a
pretty like pointed tip they're like
pink and glittery and sparkly and i
bought them because i want to wear them
at my birthday party which is this
coming weekend so i don't know i might
keep these on I might put these on I'm
not really sure what I'm going to do yet
but I'm sure let you guys know but I
just thought these were like so cute and
pretty and I just really liked him but
those are the nail her nails for me the
nail stay on for at least eight days um
the few times that I've warned him I've
had him on for seven to eight days and
then I've soaked him in hot water and
removed him myself and they came off
fairly easily so yeah they lost me at
least a week which i think is really
awesome
with them a shot with them I do the
dishes with them I just think they're
really good nails and I really enjoyed
them if you guys do want to check them
out I do have a coupon code with them it
is Samantha March and that gets you ten
percent off your order so I will leave
all that information in the desert can I
just have one more set of items to talk
about and then we are done with this
hall OMG how long is this video going to
be but I was so very excited because
this is an order that I have wanted to
place for a very very long time and I've
just been kind of waiting for the right
time to do it and you know when the
right time to do it is when the
company's having a flash twenty percent
off sale so i bought a bunch of brushes
from morphe morphy is a company that I
don't see do sales a lot probably
because so many of like beauty gurus
have the ten percent off code and so
usually when i order from morphe i used
someones code like Jaclyn hill amanda
and sing that sort of thing they all
have a ten percent off code but they
were having a flash sale one day and it
was twenty percent off and I was like
what i'm totally taking advantage of
this it was a couple days before my
birthday and I was like doesn't matter
doesn't matter it's for my birthday so
it's okay so I got what did I get seven
brushes oh no I got eight but i forgot
to bring one down and I even like I knew
I forgot and I ran upstairs and I
changed my hair and forgot to grow up
the brush I'll just have to tell you
about it but I'm actually I'm not going
to really go in depth into these brushes
because I feel like this video is
already long enough but I plan on doing
a whole morphy hall because I actually
plan on putting another order in very
soon I'm so mad today as I'm filming
this the 35 all came back in stock but
by the time I got home and checked the
website it was already out of stock I'm
waiting for the 350 to come back in
stock so i can find that one more
palette and a few other brushes that i
want to purchase so i will run through
these very quickly that i got but I got
the m5 30 which i am using for
contouring I've got the e3 which is from
the Elite Collection this i'm using as
for like setting my face or dusting off
my under-eye powder I got the e4 which I
am you
as a blush brush the e36 which is just
this little guy and I'm using it to
blend out shadows on my lower lash line
I got the e 18 which is kind of similar
to the 36 but a little bit bigger and
I'm using it that for like inner corner
highlight and I got to eye brushes that
are kind of similar one is the m4 33 and
one is the m4 for one I obviously use
the 440 one today for my eyeshadow look
and these are both I brushes blending
brushes that sort of thing these are two
that I feel like are the most popular on
youtube so i grabbed them both but yeah
i'm so excited so stay tuned as soon as
i can place the other more if you order
i will be doing a big morphe haul and
review so i can go a little bit more in
depth about the brushes and actually
review them i've only used them all just
like two or three times since i got them
so recently that i can't really review
them yet for you guys but and that was
