today's video is going to be any makeup
tutorial on this look right here but
it's not just any makeup tutorial it is
my birthday and makeup tutorial today as
this video goes live I am turning 29 and
that is pretty crazy it's really weird
to think that this is going to be like
the last year of my 20s like what so
what's going on but I'm so excited and
of course I wanted to do a makeup
tutorial look for you where we actually
are celebrating birthdays the following
weekend is that right the first weekend
of April is when are actually
celebrating birthdays and I have been
going through and starting to think like
what am I going to wear and what make a
man am I going to use and I decided to
go with us like bronzed up makeup
tutorial mostly because I has a birthday
present my mom sent me the carli bybel
palette that she collabed with that BH
Cosmetics with and it's just a lot of
like browns and golds in there so when I
was looking at it and trying to think of
like the looks that I wanted to create
with it I just kept going back to those
bronze and those golds and especially
when i swatched him i was like this
palette is just so gorgeous so that's
what I used mostly on my eyes I think
everything on my eyes is from that
palette and it's just gorgeous so that's
the inspiration that I got when I was
looking at it that's what I wanted to do
I was like I love this I feel like like
the bronze step look and like the
intense highlighter luck is just kind of
like the sexier vibe and I feel like
that's what I'm going to go for on my
birthday so that is what I decided to do
I am so excited for my birthday i love
birthdays I have so much fun celebrating
them with friends and family
and just being able to have a day to
yourself and a day to be like I want to
eat this I'm gonna eat that I want to
get ice cream cake for dinner I'm gonna
get ice cream cake cake for dinner you
know like whatever thank you all ready
for like the well wishes that are coming
in I think I've been celebrating my
birthday now for like a solid week by
myself things and just like doing nice
things for myself and i'm like it's
because it's my birthday it's my
birthday it's my birthday and I've
gotten a lot of like happy birthday is
already so thank you guys so much I
cannot wait to see what 29 has in store
for me I truly have no idea well my last
year in my 20s is going to be like not a
clue but I'm excited to see it and if
you guys want to see how I got this look
for my birthday please keep watching all
right jumping in with the bhcosmetics
color Bible palette I'm taking this
first vanilla shade and I'm placing that
underneath my brow bone and then just
kind of bringing it onto the eyelid I
did prime my eyes before hopping on
camera and this is kind of to set
everything and then I'm picking up this
gold shimmer shade with a blending brush
from bhcosmetics I'm placing this into
my crease and then kind of blending it
out bringing it down onto my lid the
reason why I chose this look is because
it's two eyeshadows and it's a very
simple look not a lot of funding any
sort of definition it's very easy and
very quick actually and when I am doing
my makeup sometimes I can kind of get
lost i can start dancing it can take a
while and i know we have a lot of people
celebrating so i don't want to be the
last one and i'm going to pick up this
intensely beautiful gold shade from the
palette and apply that all over the lid
with a flat shader brush this is
technically one of the highlight shade
but when i swatched it i was like i'm
putting this on my eyelid it's clearly
too dark of a highlight for my skin tone
but it is so so beautiful this is
without any like mac fix+ or anything
it's just this intensely pigmented on
its own it's gorgeous
and then I'm coming in with the
Maybelline master graphic eyeliner and
I'm just creating a line on my eyes and
basically I'm just doing this to have
something to place my false lash line on
when I come in with my false lashes band
not line lash band yes girl so I'm not
like really creating a wing or anything
I'm just putting down some eyeliner or
when I come in with the false lashes
then I'm going to prime my face sorry
that clip was so fast and this is the
Maybelline blur and illuminate primer
just putting that all over my face I'm
using an illuminating primer because
then I'm coming in with a matte
foundation this is the fit me matte and
poreless bluffing that in with the
morphe em 439 if I'm doing a matte
foundation and then I like an
illuminating primer so my face doesn't
look too flat same thing as if I do an
illuminating foundation I come in with a
matte primer just to balance each other
another reason i'm using this foundation
in particular is because there is no SPF
in it which means there will be no
flashback if we would use flash
photography which on my birthday we're
going to be taking pictures all night i
need not to have that like weird white
cast that you can get in photos so if
the trick is to apply foundation with no
SPF for concealer i'm using the
maybelline a better skin concealer and I
am just placing this under my eyes I'm
also going to play some on my forehead
down the bridge of my nose my Cupid's
bow in my chin and then I usually get
some redness around my mouth so I'm
putting it there as well and then I'm
going to buff that out in with the
morphine g2 and this is my ride-or-die
brush for this task I use it another
video I love it
and then to set that concealer I'm going
to use the wet and wild contouring
palette and this is an elf small tapered
brush i believe is this one it's like
two dollars at target it's my favorite
brush for this task as well I use it
every day and I'm going to set it pretty
quickly and also kind of a lot because I
think the Maybelline better skin
concealer creases up more than the other
Maybelline concealers that I have so I
make sure to come in right away and set
that and then also using the wet and
wild contour palette and a small angled
brush from bhcosmetics I'm going to
contour this palette is amazing for
these two tasks I love both the shades
in there at first I thought I like the
contour more than I like the setting
powder but honestly I love them both the
same it's amazing it's like five dollars
at the drugstore you need it so I am
contouring my cheekbones and then I'm
also going to place that shade on my
forehead and under my jaw line as well
and that was another quick club but this
is the Rimmel exaggerated eyeliner and
it's kind of like a beige nude eyeliner
pencil and I'm placing this on my
waterline I'd love to use a light color
under here or on my waterline because it
just helps open the eyes more and it's
just it's one of my go-to it's
especially this Rimmel pencil back in
the bh pilot i'm going to grab this like
dark brown shade and a flat definer
brush from BH and I'm going to pack that
pretty tightly on my lower lash line and
then I'm going to come in what's this
second-to-last gold shade with a like
larger pencil brush from BH and I'm
going to smudge that on my lower lash
line and I'm kind of bringing this down
pretty far because i want the lower lash
line to like really pop with gold and
then off camera i'm not a plasma apply
my house of lashes eyelashes in
heartbreaker and use their adhesive
thanks mom for the birthday gift for
blush I'm using Milani Luminoso blush
and this is a blush brush from
bhcosmetics i went with luminoso because
it's a beautiful peach color and i
thought it would work well with like the
gold from the bronze that we have going
on I didn't think like a pink would work
so that's why I went for the peach and
then this is just a blush brush from
Real Techniques but I use it as like a
blending brush and I'm just blending out
all the work that I've done so far it's
not something that I do with every
makeup look but for special occasions I
like to make sure my makeup salt will
lend it out and then you're going to see
me go a little ham with the highlighters
but it's my birthday you know I can do
that I'm first coming in with champagne
pop from Becca cosmetics and I'm taking
an elf flawless concealer brush brush
and applying it to the tops of my
cheekbones and a little bit in that sea
motion up towards my eyebrow and then
I'm going to come in again with that
second-to-last gold shade in the palette
using the same brush and I'm going to go
right over top of that
and I don't know just a combination with
Luminoso champagne pop and then this
gold shade just I just I loved it I
tried this look out the day before I
filmed it and my highlighter popped the
entire night it was awesome I was also
sitting at home by myself but that's
what we do I'm also placing some just a
little bit below my eyebrow and then
right on top of my eyebrow to help give
it a lifted look and then I'm taking
that same gold shade and just popping
some on my pinky and putting that in the
inner corner of my eyes and then I'm
going to take this pink shade and just
use my finger again and use it for a
nose highlight this is the nose
highlight that Carla uses every time
like even if she's not using this
palette she's always using this as a
nose highlight I did try it on my
cheekbones and I didn't think it had it
much respect but on the nose it actually
does work really well so new nose
highlight my lip combination is going to
be from colour-pop cosmetics I'm first
going to line and then fill in my lips
with the Lumiere lip pencil and then
over top that I'm going to use Lumiere
to which is one of their ultra matte
liquid lipsticks and I do want to say
going back to the eyes for one sec when
I put on my false lashes I then also
made a wing using the NYC liquid liner
what I do with NYC liquid liner is after
i put my lashes on i use that to go over
the lash band so you can't see you know
to kind of disguise that lash band and
then i also wing it out from there it's
just a technique that works easier for
me than trying to make the wing first
then putting my lashes on and then
trying to figure out if the wing has on
the right spot I like to put my lashes
on first and then make the wing and then
while I was doing that I kind of took
the gold and winged that out as well
right on top of the eyeliner and it
almost kind of gave me like Cleopatra
vibes and it's not something I would
normally do but I was like hey this is
my birthday look I can have fun with it
no one's going to call me out on it
because it's my birthday and I can wing
it out anyway that I want to
all right and then after we finish up
with the lips I'm just going to spray
with mac fix+ and the final result so I
really hope you guys enjoyed my birthday
makeup tutorial I would love to know
