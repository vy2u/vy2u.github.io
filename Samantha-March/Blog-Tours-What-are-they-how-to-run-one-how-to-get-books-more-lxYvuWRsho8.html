are you today today's video I'm going to
be talking about vlog tours I run the
company CLP blog tours and I've been
doing it since it was like 2011 2012 and
I started seeing people walk tours and I
get a lot of questions about them
especially since being on YouTube more
questions have come in on what block
tours are that I kind of talked about it
in these videos or books that are
reading for blog tours so I get
questions from readers and authors alike
so I thought I would break it down in a
video for you just let you know you know
what block tours is what the purpose of
them is how seal people on tours run the
packages that we have but then also the
benefits for both authors and bloggers
in readers now as well and then also you
know others what you need to do and same
thing for bloggers and readers what you
need to do to get signed up and all that
good stuff so hopefully this will be
kind of an informational video today for
those who have some questions on blog
tours and if you would like to see all
about CLP blog tours and virtual tours
then please keep watching okay so of
course the you know biggest question the
most common question that I get is what
is blocked tours and I guess the easiest
way to describe a blog tour is basically
putting their book on tour but only in
the virtual world and only on blogs like
you know some of like the bigger name
authors they actually go on press tours
and they go all around the country and
they do book signings at bookstores and
things like that it's kind of the same
idea is that but no one has lived at
home no one has to travel it is all done
in the virtual world so basically for a
regular blog tour a bunch of bloggers
would sign up in during a specific time
frame that seal people out tours will
market this book and they will share
their posts on scheduled days either
review of the book you know the media
kit of the book and interview with the
author whatever it is that they sign up
for they share it on their schedule day
we post about it on social media they
post about it on social media the
authors post about it on social media
and the goal of a blog tour is to get
the author's name out there get the
book's name out there hopefully bring in
some more reviews just bring in more
buzz around
book but it's nice because it's all done
from the comfort of your own home that
is basically the breakdown of what a
blog tour is another question that I get
asked a lot is why I started you know
when I started how I started that sort
of thing so Chiclets plus started in
2009 which is my blog thousand eleven I
had published my first book and I had
also started a publishing company and I
was always looking for new ways to
market the book and how to get the book
out there and I started noticing these
blog tours were out there but at the
time I mean back in 2011 block tours
were really new and so it seemed like
only companies had blog tours that were
really really expensive and weren't
really geared toward indie authors which
is more in the bubble that I am in and
so I thought well why can't I do that
and you know over the time that I had
been running chiclet plus I'd met
several other book bloggers as well and
so I just sent out an email to a bunch
of bloggers and I said hey would you
guys be interested if i start at this
company and i asked you you know do you
want to promote this book are you guys
on board do you think that's a cool idea
and i got a lot of really good feedback
and so I thought okay you know let's
start this let's do this I started out
as a free website so my website was CLP
blog tours dat wordpress com I didn't
hire a designer or anything I just did a
free wordpress site just to see how it
went just to put it out there created it
kind of have the idea in mind I had like
two packages or something available and
put it out there on social media you
know anyone want me to book you a blog
tour and I think I had five scheduled in
the first two weeks which is a really
big deal to me i thought okay people
really do want this to happen and i mean
it has just grown since then we create
it like an a more professional looking
website from then and now we are just
CLP blog tours com i now own the domain
I on the website I hired a real designer
who actually knows what they're doing to
design the blog to our website and all
that good stuff the packages change
constantly I'm always trying to look and
see what it is that authors want what it
is they're needing you know what we're
looking for what best ways to market
so always updating packages there are so
many packages that we have available now
so it can be difficult to keep up on the
trends but you know especially because
this is my full-time job I am an author
I'm so immersed in book marketing that
you know it's really not too difficult
for me because this is part of my job so
that's kind of why I started CLP blog
tours if you're wondering about the name
CLP that's a spin-off of course from
chiclet plus I just add a blog tours to
it I wasn't very innovative back in the
day but I've kept it because chiclet
plus and CLP blog tours obviously I mean
we work so closely with each other to
clip+ host almost every single to her
that is on tour you know we put all of
the books on the chiclet plus page as
well they're on the social media pages I
mean they just go hand in hand so I
thought no need to update the name then
another question that gets asked a lot
is you know what genres do we take do we
take every author the way I look at seal
people up tours as I look at it how I do
chicklet plus and basically chiclet plus
you know we're very heavily focused on
Chiclets women's fiction romance you
know young adult new adult yes like
Chiclets mr. yes so you know anything
that falls within those genres those are
who we really do take on and it's never
like I don't want to take on a book but
really I need to think about my audience
I need to think about the bloggers that
are signed up with CLP blog tours don't
have a lot of like thriller mystery
bloggers signed up so it's going to be
really hard if an author comes to me and
says you know I want a 15 stopped or for
my thriller mystery and I'm like well I
only have four signed up so that's gonna
be hard so boys down to try unless I
really you know know that it's not going
to be a good fit but I'm always down to
try and see what we can do and see how
many bloggers we can get signed up and
you know try to be flexible but yum the
main genres are the ones on Chiclets
Plus as well Chiclets women's fiction
romance yna the lighter side of
mysteries you know that sort of thing
that's who we really cater to and that's
where our biggest audiences need to be
published some people very few authors
have
asked you know can we put a blog tour on
before the book is published and I don't
know if that just maybe as a personal
preference of mine but i prefer the book
to be published because what i want in a
blog tour is i want you to get more
sales i want you to get more amazon
clicks I want you to get you know a
bigger social media file you know all
that stuff but the biggest parts of it
is driving people towards your book and
if your book isn't published yet it's
kind of like well what are we doing I
mean we do do tours for things like
cover reveals which obviously your book
is not out yet in a cover reveal but
cover reveals are a good way to get some
hype around your book so we do do those
those are probably the only tour package
that we have where a book is not already
published is the cover revealed sewer
breakdown of CLP blog tours what a blog
tour is and kind of what we're looking
for but next I'm going to jump over to
the author side of things and give
benefits for authors and kind of what
you need and can expect out of a blog
tour ok so for authors that are curious
about booking a blog tour some of the
benefits that I see of doing a blog tour
is for is kind of taking what marketing
you should be doing for your book and
you're basically giving it to someone
else and letting them do it put a book
out you really do want to make sure you
ask book bloggers to share about your
book into you know possibly review the
book or at least just shared on their
social media because both buggers are a
really important part of any marketing
plan I believe and this isn't only on
the indie side of things I work very
closely with the publicist of you know
st. Martin's and penguin and you know
they are constantly emailing me you know
I'm on their email list when they have a
new book coming out the email chiclet
plus to ask if we will share about it
bloggers have a big social media
following but they also are very trusted
in the book world and readers really i
believe readers look up to them and they
want to hear their thoughts about books
and they want to know the new books that
are coming out they want to know what
they should be reading so people look to
book bloggers a lot to know you know
what should they put on their reading
schedule so both bloggers are so
important I believe to hit up when
you're going through your marketing
and and especially if you're a new
author and especially if you're new to
like the social media world you're gonna
have no idea where it turn and you know
I get that a lot from authors saying you
know I'm brand new and i just opened my
twitter account i've never talked to any
book loggers before like what do i do so
it's really nice to be able to hire a
company that has those relationships
already developed with book bloggers and
already have you know a database and an
email list that we can send out and
trying to get bloggers on board for you
so you know yes of course a blog tour
does cost money but you're putting that
money towards your marketing and you're
having someone else be able to do that
work for you you're having someone else
send out the email you're having someone
else follow up making sure people are
sharing the reviews sharing their posts
you're making sure people are getting
their media kids you're taking all those
tasks that you would normally have to do
as an author you're giving it to someone
else and saying like you know you do it
you go with it you roll with it if
someone is late or someone has a poster
review you tell them I'm just going to
sit back here at my house and wait for
you to do it so that's what I think is a
big benefit for authors that you can
save that time and you know maybe you
can take that time and be doing
something else like writing another book
or focusing your efforts in your
marketing elsewhere and someone else is
taking over that part of your marketing
for you so I just think that is one
really big benefit for authors and then
of course the other benefits are just
getting your name out there and getting
your book out there and having those
bloggers tweet about you and share about
you on facebook to you know all of their
readers and another thing that I think
is really important with blog tours you
know you go on one blog tour but one
thing that I say the authors is you know
you keep a list two of those bloggers
that worked with you because then when
you publish your next book those
bloggers now know you and they do have a
connection with you maybe they've read
your book so when you publish your next
book you're already going to have you
know that's how you're going to start
your list that's how you're going to
start it out and I know some people
sometimes are like that's a really
stupid business ideas method like why
are you just handing over your your
business your contacts to your thoughts
I mean new authors pop up every day so
I've never in a feeling of like oh no I
don't have any tours coming up or
there's no
authors coming in new authors are
popping up all the time but even some of
the older ones I've done 67 blog tours
for one author before simply because
they don't want to take the time they
want to be focusing their time somewhere
else so yes they could have this great
list built up from their tours but they
just simply don't want to take the time
they have something else they want to
focus on so they asked me to do it now
we've worked together several times they
trust me they trust my blogger is all
about helping people and helping authors
and giving them the confidence that they
need for when they publish more books I
just I think that's the most beautiful
thing of it all it's not just me staying
in business so when people say that to
me I'm just kind of like huh that's not
where my mind goes and I mean yes I'm
went to business school I have a
business degree but that's just I'm just
more about helping people in helping
them understand the marketing part of it
I think that part is just really cool
but I've I've had several several
authors that are repeat on repeat on
repeat authors another big benefit I
think is that now you're making the
connections now you're getting out there
hopefully you're getting more
comfortable being on social media and
talking about your book you know that
sort of thing so I think those can
really be the benefits to authors for
getting a blog tour I know how to submit
um if you go to CLP blog tours com I
mean all these links will be below as
well too so you can easily find the
links below I'm chiclet plus there's a
whole section dedicated only to blog
tours and you'll see all the different
packages but on the seal people out
tours website the very first like item
on the menu will say packages and if you
click on that all the packages will be
there all of the rates will be on there
you can see everything there's
information listed below like what that
package includes how many stops it
includes packages will be listed there i
mean the cover reveal packages we have
release day packages we review only
packages we have longer virtual tours i
mean we just have a plethora of packages
a new one that we added recently is a
review opportunity and a review
opportunity is open to not only book
bloggers but just readers in general as
i mentioned earlier that i'm always
trying to keep up with what it is that
authors are looking for more and more
these days the really big focus when
publishing a book is getting reviews
your book and especially getting reviews
on Amazon so that's why I created the
review opportunity package because it
opens up the door is not only two of
those book bloggers but also to readers
in general who have an amazon and a
goodreads account and they just get a
review copy of your book and then they
leave you a review so that's a really
good way to build up the reviews but yes
if you look at all those packages like I
said the packages will be there the
rates will be there what's included you
know that sort of thing it will all be
listed on there and there's also a form
underneath all of the packages there's a
form that you would fill out with like
your name and your title and the genre a
time frame that you're looking for what
package you're most interested in and
then once I receive that request from
you I'll email you we'll talk about it
we'll make sure we got everything set
that we need a request a few items from
you in order to put a sign up going for
your blog tour the items that I need are
your cover art and your blurb if you are
having reviews in your tour I need to
know what formats you will have
available for reviewers will you have
print copies available if you do have
print copies I do have any shipping
restrictions some authors only want to
ship to the US US and canada some are
open worldwide you know I need to know
that information because we owe bloggers
from all over the world signed up with
CLP blog tours I need to know will you
have a kindle file available and epub a
file available for nook readers well you
have a PDF copy available for those that
maybe don't have any readers but read
off the computer so those are the items
that I need to know in order to get your
sign up running and that'll all be
listed under that packages page if you
just click on that look at the packages
find one that you think will work out
for you you fill out the form and I'm
email you and we get it going and kind
of I just wanted to touch base really
quickly on kind of what happens during a
blog tour so let's say that you're just
doing like a virtual tour which is a
specific package you're going on the one
week virtual tour package with the seven
stops so after I get your sign up
running put the sign up on chiclet plus
and then I put it down on social media
and then I also email it out to our
newsletter list that has all the
bloggers on there once we have the
specific amount of stops OH
say it seven stops once we have seven
blog signed up I closed that blog tour I
take away the signup form I then
paypaled the author the invoice so I
don't pay pal you until we have your
list fold this is just to ensure you
know nothing crazy goes on like we can't
fill your blog tour list it's just in my
nature to wait until I know that I have
fulfilled my commitment on my end then I
send the invoice once the invoice is
paid then I send you the blog to our
list using a google doc that we will
share I used to do microsoft word now I
send a google doc that we can share we
can both me and the author can see the
names of the bloggers that are signed up
their blog names their blog URLs what
they signed up for that they sign up for
a review an interview they just want a
promo post I don't think that will
happen your tour includes reviews review
copies need to be sent out once review
copies are sent out and those can either
be sent out by the author or by me and a
lot of authors want me to do it and I'm
totally I kind of prefer that because
then it's just easier for me if I have
the files on hand that in a few weeks if
I am checking what the bloggers to make
sure they've all received it someone
says no I have the file on hand myself I
resend it to them I don't have to go
back and father the author I can just do
it all myself so review copies are sent
out once review copies are sent out then
we get blog tour dates firmly in place
the reason why I wait to confirm the
blog tour dates is because sometimes
with tours that include reviews there's
delays in the books proofreading got
delayed their formatting got delayed now
the review copies are being delayed it's
not fair to only give my bloggers two
weeks to read a book even one week to
read a book that's not fair to them so
that is why I wait until I review copies
are finished done they're sent out there
in the hands of the reviewers then we go
ahead and schedule the dates because
then I know for sure that my bloggers
have enough time to read that book
because book blogger is like I mentioned
they're so important in the marketing
world of books that they are also super
busy we look out chicklet plus books out
usually three months so I need to make
sure that I'm giving them enough
once the dates are scheduled I get back
to the bloggers I have them pick dates I
put dates into that Google Doc I create
a tour page on CLP blog tours I create a
graphic for your blog tour and from
there i'm just doing things like
checking what the bloggers huh do they
have their review copies do they have
their media kits sent out and getting
with the author to make sure i have the
media kits from them do I have your
author bio your photo your social media
links the by links for the book are we
doing a giveaway we're getting the
giveaway ready so that's what we're
doing leading up to the blog tour and
then the week before the blog tour is
when I send out media kids to the
bloggers I confirm everyone with their
dates again make sure we're all good to
go and then the actual tour kicks off if
during the tour I do ask the bloggers
that they have their posts up by 8am
every single day in the morning so right
when I wake up I can go and I can insert
those direct links to their posts right
onto the tour page if they are not up by
like nine or ten a.m. I'm emailing them
reminders like hey can you send me that
link once it's up I'm also emailing the
author saying okay I acknowledge this is
not up yet I'm feeling emailing the
bloggers trying to give them reminders
I'm trying to contact them keep in touch
with you a big thing to remember with
blog tours as is that the bloggers are
not employees of CLP blog tours they are
not being paid to do this it really is
they're happy so it's really just like
the honor system I I trust you that you
signed up for this that you're then
going to post I trust that you accepted
a review copy and you're going to review
it does it always work that way now you
know unfortunately we do have tours
where I just never hear back from a
blogger we have tours where bloggers
says you know my personal life has
gotten in the way or we've had a family
emergency or it just wasn't able to
finish or whatever reason we at that
point that a blog tour is going on
there's really nothing I can do in that
situation I can try to put an extra post
on chocolate plus I can talk about it
more on social media but because the
tour is already in the works it's really
too difficult for me to find a backup
blogger because like i said the buggers
are also busy
make sure that i mentioned that because
it can happen on tours and it's you know
unfortunately it's not uncommon but I
also do send that out in an author
acknowledgement email I just list you
know this is a possibility that it could
happen so of course just want to throw
that out there for you but usually in
the mornings everything is going fine
I'm putting the links into the tour page
so when an author or anyone comes to
look at that tour page they can say oh
chocolate plus hosted a review today and
boom click right on it it takes you to
the review on Chiclets plus and then in
the mornings i'm posting on the chiclet
plus facebook page and twitter page and
sue page i'm tagging the author and
taking the blogger I'm retweeting the
bloggers legs and retweeting from the
author you know we're just trying to
create as much social media buzz as we
can so that's kind of the schedule
leading up to a blog tour kind of the
things that we need to sign up so I hope
I touched on everything you know there's
a lot of information on CL p-block tours
and on Chiclets plus of course you can
always email me at any time if you have
questions but also if you're an author
are watching this and i miss something i
missed a big obvious question that i
should have answered much i'm sure could
totally be the case please just comment
below let me know just ask away and i
will be so happy to get back to you and
answer that I'll be monitoring the
comments very closely because even
though for this video I actually did
write my points down because I wanted to
make sure I touched on everything but
i'm like i just know i'm probably
forgetting something so if you still
have a question after watching all that
please just comment below and then left
i've talked about is our fabulous
bloggers and readers I mean really
without all of the work and the
contributions that the bloggers and the
readers make I mean CLP blog tours would
not obviously be able to operate so I am
so incredibly thankful for the
relationships and the connections that
I've made since i started chiclet plus
we celebrate six years in October this
year which is absolutely wild it's so
wonderful and amazing and beautiful and
all of those things to be able to know
that I have a group of virtual
friends not even all across the country
but all across the world it's so amazing
to me that I'm friends with people in
Italy in the UK and that we get to talk
on a daily basis about books and what we
love I just think that's so beautiful
benefits of course to being a blogger or
being a reviewer with CLP block tours
thinking about the book bloggers first
you know a big benefit is you are
getting more content for your blog
starting out with Chiclets plus I was
only getting my books from like our
local library or I was borrowing from
friends and so you know if you're a
newer blogger or if even if you're a
more seasoned blogger and you're just
always on the lookout for how to get
more books how to be able to feature
more books how to make sure that you're
getting a lot of content out on your
blog to keep people coming back to your
blog along those same lines is having
something to talk about on social media
honestly does seem like a struggle these
days sometimes to think of something to
post on social media something to share
on Instagram of something good to say on
twitter that are going to get people
interested and if you are sharing
authors and books on your blog you of
course want to share about them on your
social media so it's a good way to beef
up your social media content as well so
many benefits I think to being a book
blogger I mean it's it's really changed
my life since starting chiclet plus I
mean I just did a whole video about my
top five moments in starting chiclet
plus and since becoming a book blogger I
have interviewed authors like emily
giffin and jackie collins and I have
gotten to have good relationships with
their publicist and I get to review
their early copies and just do all these
wonderful and amazing things it's led me
to more opportunities that led me to see
all people out tours that led me to
publishing it led me to owning a
publishing company it's now led me to
this is my full-time career I do books
full time and that started with me just
having a very small idea of starting a
book blog there's just so many
opportunities out there I feel like for
book bloggers if you're really invested
you're really passionate about what you
do keep working hard keep posting keep
reading keep reviewing keep building
those relationships and just see where
it takes you because it could take you
to incredible places being on a good
relationship with blog to our companies
and even publicist like I mentioned you
know I was just starting out doing
the library and borrowing from friends
and I kept going and now I'm on the e
mailing list for penguin and st.
Martin's and you know the places like
that and so I can get to read really
awesome books that are coming out so
those are just a few benefits of being a
book blogger and if you do not have a
book blog but you love reviewing books
and you would like to sign up for those
review opportunities and of course your
big benefit is is you're getting free
ebooks and if you love to read I mean
getting free ebooks is amazing and
incredible but i always do want to point
out that they're not just free ebooks no
one's just handing you a book and being
like okay you know have fun with that
you are expected to do a review for the
author because reviews for authors are
so so important and of course we don't
want to just be giving our books away
for no reason we do expect something
back from that and what we expect with
review opportunities is that you will
share your honest review on places like
Amazon good reads your blog you know
shelfari librarything wherever else you
have accounts we do want to see those
reviews there and we want to see you you
know even just talking about it you know
hey I read a good book the other day
this is who it was because that social
media that word of mouth is so important
to author that's another big benefit if
you want to sign up to be a reader with
cl people out tours how to sign up is
basically the same way as what I
mentioned with the author's if you go to
seal people out tours com again links
for all of this will be below and you
will find on the top menu bar there will
be one that says fantastic bloggers and
this does have links to all of the blogs
that we have worked with forever I mean
I honestly don't go in there and update
it a lot and like remove links and
things like that because some people
just take a blog hiatus you know so I'd
really don't go in there and remove a
lot i only ever update so there's a lot
of blogs on there but if you scroll to
the very bottom there will be a list
that you will be able to submit a form
it all gets sent to me and i will send
you a confirmation email saying hey
you're now on our newsletter list you
know thank you for signing up the
information that i want to know from you
is of course your name your email
address your blog URL if you have an
e-reader because that is very important
because a lot of authors these days
especially with blog tours along
times they're only sending out advanced
reader copies and majority of times
these are done only by ebooks so I want
to know if you have an e-reader and I
also want to know your desired
preferences now do you like to read only
chocolate do you like Chiclets women's
fiction and romance do you only want to
read romance you only want to read why
ice so I'll ask for your preferences so
if you do want to sign up to be a book
blogger or a reviewer the links to be
able to do that will be in the
description box below so be sure to
check those out it's just one simple
form that you fill out and boom you're
on the email list and i will send you an
email confirmation once you are on that
list to know that you have been added
flip plus in our top header form this is
Chiclets plus comm versus CLP block
tours if you go to Chiclets plus comm
one of the menu bars says for bloggers
if you click on that there will be links
to all of the open signups that we have
right now i'm also always posting on
Facebook and Twitter once we have open
signups if we have new signups just the
reminders that hey these signups are
open so be sure to follow us on our
social media because you'll be able to
see new tours as they come in that we
are signing up for you can sign up for
it like normal every single blog tour
just has one of those simple google
forms that you use to sign out the
information gets sent to me I again send
a confirmation email to you saying thank
you for signing up usually I say
something like review copies will be
sent out shortly or I will have more
information shortly or something like
that but that is getting you on the list
for the blog tour so I will be sure to
post that for bloggers link below as
well in the description box for you to
see and the expectations for bloggers
sickly what I ask is if you sign up to
do something that you follow through on
it because really there's nothing more
devastating that was my dog there's
really you know it's such a blow for
authors when people sign up to do their
blog tour and even just one stop missing
especially if it has a review involved
with it it's just such a bummer when
someone doesn't post but especially
doesn't give any sort of feedback to me
you know are you on vacation in your
post student schedule are you sick are
you ill are you having emerged
see you know what's going on it's just
so nice if you touch base with me and
let me know hey I'm so sorry I'm on
vacation my flight got delayed I don't
have my post up yet but I can get it up
tomorrow great then I will take that
information I will relate it to the
author and I will update the tour page
to show that but really nothing is worse
because all I do in the morning for my
first two hours of my morning as I'm
checking on blog tours and I'm making
sure posts are going up I'm trying to
reach people and it really really sucks
pretty bad for me when I'm not hearing
from people and 11am and i'm still like
where are these poles like I want to get
on with my day people I do ask for
bloggers to post by 8am everyday a.m.
CST central time zone that is the time
zone i am in i start work about eight
o'clock every single day and the first
thing like i said that i do is i work on
vlog tours so that is why i asked for
that if i don't see something by like
9-930 ten o'clock i'm emailing the
blogger is saying hey can you send me
this link when it's up and i'll send
another one to two emails and try to
find you on social media to say hey is
this post coming i really need to give
the author and update let them know
what's going on so just the biggest
expectations from the bloggers is you
know getting your posts up when you say
that you're going to get them up and if
there is an issue that you email me or
facebook me or Twitter me and just let
me know what's going on so the author
isn't in the dark expectation is of
course if you receive a review copied
that you actually share a review don't
just get a review copy and then leave it
sitting and not read it because you know
authors are not giving away those review
copies just for fun they're doing it
because it is a review copy they do
expect a review in exchange for you
receiving the book post on your social
media you know tag the author if you can
when I send out media kits it includes
links to the author social media like
their facebook and our twitter page grab
their handles send him a tweet hey i'm
on your two or loved your book you know
you know something so simple like that
honestly honestly just makes an author's
day when a reader are a blogger or
whoever sends us the tweet to let us
know like hey happy to read your book i
loved your book you know that sort of
thing that's really really big deal to
sew you up sharing on your social media
that's just another
added benefit that you could do as well
I think that about wraps it up for
bloggers and reviewers i will say for
the review opportunity i don't think i
mentioned this yet once review copies go
out for review opportunity the readers
have three months to share the reviews
on amazon amazon the review has to be
posted on amazon and then it's optional
if you want to post elsewhere like like
I said like good reads your blog or any
other review sites but Amazon needs to
be where your review is definitely
posted too but you have three months
from receiving your review copy and I
send out an email saying okay three
months starts today your reviews are due
at this time and then every month I'm
sending an email checking in with you
guys hey you got your book right hey
this is when that review is do you know
don't forget let me know if you need
anything let me know if you're getting
behind all that good stuff so for review
opportunities there a little bit
different because they don't have a set
schedule like blog tours do you just
have three months from receiving your
review copy so i did want to be sure to
mention that but i think that is all i
have to say for bloggers of course just
like i said with authors if i missed
anything or if you have any other
questions after this please do comment
below and let me know i'll be sure to be
checking in the comments so i can answer
any questions i come in i mean i'm sure
i forgot at least one if not more
questions that i should have answered so
yes any questions that all that Papa
please just come up below let me know
and I'm so happy to answer them like I
said I'm just I'm so grateful and
thankful to be doing something that is a
part of what I love I love bringing
authors and readers together I think
it's such a beautiful thing and to you
know be able to consider this as part of
my career it's just so amazing so I just
want to give a huge thank you to all of
the authors who I've worked with over
all of these years you know the word of
mouth that you've given CLP block tours
has been absolutely incredible I
wouldn't be where I was without the
amazing support of the author's and you
know telling their other author friends
about CLP blog tours referrals is the
biggest way that I get business coming
in so thank you so much to all the
authors who have let me work with you I
you know I definitely understand
how personal writing a book is I've
written for myself now I know how
personal it is to write a book and to
put it out there you want someone with a
passion for books and someone who really
believes in books and believes in
marketing the books to be working with
you on your side and i truly hope that I
am that person because I have such a
passion and such a huge love for books
and for what I do so I love that I can
do this every single day I just think
it's beautiful and for the bloggers I
mean there's been so many bloggers
throughout the years that I have met
made connections with I've even been
able to meet some people in person at
different book signings and book events
around the country these past few years
I mean seal people have tours honestly
could not run without the support of the
bloggers and the readers you guys do
amazing things I am so happy when I seen
you book vlogs pop up and you know new
bloggers coming to CLP blog tours and
wanting to sign up because I'm just like
yes people are going for and they're
pursuing their passions I mean it does
not get any better than that when you
see that happening and I'm so proud like
I'm proud when I see new book box pop up
even though it has nothing to do with me
and I've had nothing to do with their
decision to become a book blogger but
I'm just like yes you go that's so it's
so amazing my biggest thing ever is if
you have a passion you pursue it you
just you go get it and I just love being
able to work with all sorts of book
bloggers from all over the country new
old I just it's amazing my job is so
incredible and seal people hug tours is
a huge part of my job I mean it's a huge
part of my job and my daily day it's my
to-do list is often filled with blog to
