clap my hands at the start of videos i
noticed that I like I just clap that's
weird anyways so today's video is going
to be a book haul and I'm really excited
because I have for print books to show
you guys I don't have to be like
fumbling with my tablet the entire time
because that's fun so for books that
will be reviewed throughout the next few
months the first one is 800 grapes by
Laura Dave and I think this cover is so
cute i love like the simplicity of it i
love i love the title because i love
grapes I mean I could eat grapes all day
and then I think I'm being really
healthy and I'm like hey I ate like two
pounds of grapes today people are like
that a so much sugar in it it's fruit I
don't know I just think it's healthy but
that does nothing to do with this book
you so much to Laura for sending me this
book i just posted a book selfie of it
like last week on my social media
because i was like look at this cute
little cover i really enjoyed laura
Dave's books I can leave some links to
her books and the reviews that I've done
below it's like it's going to take place
in a Sonoma vineyard which I'm already
like yes let's read that follow George
afford and she's going to learn some
important secrets the secret number of
grapes it takes to make a bottle of wine
800 the secret ingredient in her
mother's lasagna chocolate mom I've
always liked your lasagna what's your
secret recipe do you put chocolate in
there that's interesting i'm gonna have
to don't have to read about that for
sure the secret way to end any fight
hold hands but just a week before her
wedding georgia discovers her beloved
fiance's been keeping a secret so
explosive it will change their lives
forever that's a really cute synopsis
like I literally wanted to read that
entire thing too because i thought the
secrets and i thought that was
really good way to write the blurry but
immediately had me interested as an
advanced readers edition like our most
of the books that I get our advanced
copies which means usually it means it's
not been like professionally formatted
yet it might still need to go through
proofreading so sometimes there's like
little errors that you'll find or
sometimes I even find like notes in our
copies that say like have like a note to
the author Ajay think is funny sometimes
like the dedication say to be decided so
that's kind of when art copy is in case
anyone's like wondering what I'm talking
about but this goes on sale jun 2nd so
that means my review will probably be
probably becoming like that week or the
following week or somewhere around that
time so that's 800 grapes really cute
book I'm looking forward to it the next
one that I have is the art of baking
blind and this is by Sarah Vaughn that's
a cute cover as well and i have to tell
you guys just piece of paper in here
from who I got it from I got it from st.
Martin's Press so thank you st. Martin's
I love food books like whenever I get
something like this the art of baking
blinds so clearly there's going to be
some sort of baking and felt and food
and whenever I see books like that I'm
just like aha me I want to read those my
interest in books I mean I've talked
about it they just spread everywhere
chiclet romance women's fiction I like
mysteries I like food ebook what do you
do I just like both again it's funny
because I get a lot of review requests
and I look at them and I read them and I
have to decide which ones i'm going to
take myself and which ones i'm going to
pass on to my review team to see who
wants to read and review on and i got
this one this request and i was like my
schedule is so full because this this is
a real copy this is not an AR see um it
comes out May fifth and I was like my
may schedule for reading is so full i
don't think i can do it and then i
started reading about it and I was like
oh
to read it so kind of a little bit from
the back cover it says take five
strangers with nothing in comment except
a passion for baking add a hotly
contested competition and beat to stiff
peaks heat to just the right amount of
tension ice with the bittersweet tale of
the iconic women who inspired them all
enjoy in snatched bites or devour at
once inning and relish the exquisite
combination of dark and light flavors
the delicious moments and mouth-watering
twists and I'm like okay so I need to
read it so I'm going to and I'm really
excited for it like the cover it's kind
of a bigger book so and at the hardcover
which i think is cool II don't really
get a lot of hard covers anymore so
really looking forward to the art of
baking blind by Sarah bond the next one
let's just wait a minute before i show
you what we got going on here this is a
book from Jackie Collins I'm so excited
to read it I love Jackie I think I might
have mentioned and talked about my past
with Jackie before she was one of the
first big authors that I was contacted
to review for in Chiclets plus had been
able to interview her I talked with her
own social media I think she is such a
cool person and author and women and I'm
on really good terms with her PR people
so they send me her books which is great
and so in the mail the other day I got
the Oh am I going to be able to
pronounce this right says the San
tangelos the same tangelos am I saying
that right I could be maybe I'm not
saying it right but the book is called
the same tangelos and then I took it out
of the wrapping and was like oh my god
Vegas book ever that's a log book that
to me that's like that's a lot of book I
was immediately intimidated and then I
had to remember that a lot of Jackie's
books are fairly larger i wish i had
pulled him from my shelf so i could show
you guys but she tends to have
big books and every time i get 1 i'm
like there's no way I'm get this is
going to take me like a week to read how
am I going to get through it but her
writing is so good her storytelling is
so strong you just I get transported
into wherever it is we're going whether
it's Vegas are going to boat or an
island or Italy wherever it is that
Jackie's going to take us I immediately
fall into that story and I finish her
books so fast because i think they are
so good so i'm trying not to get to
intimidate it by the stand tangelos so
really excited to read this one again
it's my early reader coffee and this
goes on sale june sixteenth so that's
kind of around when my review will run
but the first line is lust revenge and
power run in the family spend your
summer with the San tangelos an epic
saga from the legendary Jackie Collins
so that's what we got going on really
excited about it if you haven't heard
any of the San tangelos ikea Santangelo
is so much fun to read about she like
she's so fun to read about her stories
are just awesome he totally can get into
her world because she's such a cool
character to read about so if you
haven't read any of Jackie's books or
any of the Santangelo books or any of
the books about lucky i highly suggest
you do because they are so much fun to
read and i'm really looking forward to
reading this bad boy so cool cover two
and then my last one one more book for
the week is from Tracy I totally should
have asked her how to pronounce her last
name I think I've mentioned that I get
so worried about pronouncing people's
names because I'm afraid I'm going to
say it wrong so this is from Tracy
krimmer krimmer and it's called cashing
in and kind of a play on words here with
the cashing in very cute cover very it's
just like a cute cute reading I really
like it she sent me some okay she said
get this in the book just kind of a
thank you card can you see that it's
from frozen but it has old off on it and
Olaf is my absolute favorite and I
opened it up I was like Olaf that's so
cool Thank You Tracy I see the first
line on this one is can a compass lead
you to love probably not me because I
don't think I can read a compass but we
follow brokenhearted alley whose have
enough with her ridiculous life her job
is knowing going nowhere her love life
is so she could try something new I i am
very looking forward does that make
sense i am very much looking forward to
reading this one from Tracy and I'm so
thankful for her that she sent it to me
she was watching i think it was so she
was watching a video and and asked if
she could send me a copy of a book to
review and mention and I was like yes
girlfriend I will do that for you I
follow her on social media she thoughts
me we have yoga chats and all that fun
stuff so thank you so much Tracy I'm
very excited to read cashing in I will
