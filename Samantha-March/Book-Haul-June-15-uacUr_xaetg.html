hey guys thanks for watching today's
video is just going to be a quick little
book haul I almost forgot what I was
going to be doing I only have four books
to share with you guys I have more that
we've gotten of course but I'm just kind
of crunched for a time because i'm
heading to a wedding here shortly but i
wanted to get this feeling really quick
the book hauls here on youtube but i
also do some in my mail boxes on
Chiclets plus and so i can leave a link
to the section on Chiclets plus that has
all the in my mailbox post so you guys
can see what else we are getting if you
are interested but i will just hop right
into it the first bucket that I got is
the knockoff and this is by Lucy Sykes
and Joe Piazza and I don't know if
you'll be able to see the smart ok
excessive really shiny cover and then
filming with my flash on because of
course it's raining and storming in Iowa
because that's all it's been doing for
weeks it seems like but this book has is
like hugely talked about this summer
it's a really big deal and I was really
excited to be able to get it for review
it kicks off the inside front cover says
it's an outrageously stylish wickedly
funny novel of fashion in the digital
age and I got some bookmarks came flying
out at me leave this book from the
doubleday publishing group which is a
division of random house and then they
also sent me a bookmark with it oh yeah
thank you please yes this one is very
very talked about this summer um I'm
really looking forward to reading it
sounds like it's going to be a lot of
Chiclets I know it was kind of compared
to like the devil wears prada it's like
somewhere on those levels you guys hear
my dog she's ridiculous but so this is
the knockoff and I think my review was
coming up actually pretty soon i have
set up that was my dog i had set up the
review for it and everything but then I
didn't get the book so I actually had to
email them
back and be like I still haven't gotten
it just now got it so that's why it's
just being included in a haul video but
the review is coming soon the next one
that I got is the cake therapist and
this one is by Judith fertig verdict
dang it dang it you don't have this
problem when you only write your reviews
and you write down people's names you
don't have to pronounce them the cake
therapist and like look at this cover
come on like you knew I would probably
want to read it because it's definitely
on that food ebook side and I love those
as it wasn't often that I had a
difficulty tasting something flavor with
the way flavor was the way people like
me made sense of the world we knew that
there was a flavor that explained you
even to yourself a flavor whose truth
you recognize when you tasted it a
flavor that answered the question you
didn't know you had I'll keep reading it
for you because I'm quite intrigued now
perhaps it was a voluptuous vanilla that
year sharp edge itself could sink into
like a pillow or a homesick pomegranate
each seed like a ruby slipper that would
take you back to the place where you
were loved and where people had missed
you that's where I was going if only I
could taste it that's a really
intriguing blur like I was only gonna
read you guys the first line and then i
read it was like a whole lot i need to
read more and then i read the second one
was like okay I'll read the last one but
i'm still like is there more because
that was really interesting look how
cute this inside cover as though look at
QC all like the little treats on there
that's so cute i love that again foodie
book i really love those type of books i
love this cover it intrigued me right
away so this is the cake therapist and
then i have to ebooks to show you guys
as well the first one is the broken road
and it's by Melissa Huey that is the
broken road and it is the first in a
series and what I kind of found
intriguing about this i'm actually
reviewing it for CLP blog tours but what
I found really interesting when I was
trying to decide you know I
review it or someone from my review team
going to read it I went to the Amazon
page to look at it one I found the cover
really intriguing you know you found it
and drinking too didn't you girls yeah
that I thought was really interesting
was that is that it has over 200 Amazon
reviews which that's a pretty big deal
it's not easy to get Amazon reviews
especially because Amazon um amazon just
very freely deletes people's reviews if
they don't believe that they should be
posted for example anyone in my family
my mom my mother-in-law my husband no
one can post amazon reviews from my
books for me amazon will delete them
which is crazy even my good friends are
not able to leave reviews for me
understand if i'm going off on a hold
hand in here sorry you guys this is
supposed to be a really quick video I
understand if someone from like marching
aimed my own publishing company I
understand that we can't review for each
other because we're probably going to be
biased but even just other connections
that I've made in the blocking world in
the author world we offers can no longer
review for each other because Amazon
doesn't theme those acceptable and they
delete them and I think that's crazy
because especially in the authors we
work our butts off making connections
online on social media on YouTube
wherever it is we're going we work so
hard to make these connections because
reviews are so important amazon reviews
are what we use to be able to be
featured on other big-name sites bookbub
is a huge website that authors want to
be featured on and you have to have a
minimum number of Amazon reviews in
order to be considered so for Amazon to
just be pulling these reviews just
because they don't feel like someone
that you have a good connection with can
post your review that's why it's me
there's a there's been a really big
issue these past few days actually as
I'm filming this that amazon has just
been doing a purge on so many authors
books my books are effective marchings
books are being affected so many of my
other funds books are being affected and
it sucks I feel like we should be able
to review what we want to review and
Amazon is always you can't buy anything
on Amazon without getting an email from
them
review that's review this review this
they come to my phone after you read a
kindle book it wants you to review it
but then amazon wants to pull all the
reviews that doesn't make sense to me
I'm not gonna lie that doesn't make
sense to me back to the book that I was
talking about it just caught my eye that
she has so many Amazon reviews like I
get um 212 out the time i'm filming
amazon reviews which a means a lot of
people read the book but it also means
you know not everyone not just you know
a regular reader versus like a book
blogger or book reviewer not everyone
will leave their review and a lot of
times you see people leave their reviews
because they felt something about the
book whether it be good or bad they're
reviewing because it stirred up
something in them and they want to talk
to other people about it so that's what
immediately kind of caught my eye and
fifty one percent of those reviews are
five stars thirty percent of those
reviews are four stars so I mean that's
eighty-one percent only took me a second
there to remember what I was adding up
those are really favorable reviews so a
lot of people seem to be really enjoying
this book so based on the cover and the
Amazon reviews that is what made me say
yes I want to review this book that was
a lot on that book I'm sorry you guys I
had the next one that i have is things
you won't say and this one is i totally
don't know how to pronounce her name
either sarah sarah p let's call her
Sarah p in this video because I'm kind
of afraid to say her last name because
it's probably gonna be comical I did
have one author email me just a few
weeks ago and they're like not a big
deal but this is actually how you
pronounce my name and I was like light
years away from it dang it so this one
by therapy she is oh I I love her books
I love when she puts out new books
because i think i am fairly confident i
have read all of her books reviewed all
of them and I just absolutely love them
she's also one of those authors who is
very good on so
media she's always responding when I put
a tweet out there saying I'm reading her
book she responds back and you know says
thank you and I hope you like it and I
think that's such a big deal these days
so I love being able to read from her
this one is a little bit interesting
because I have actually already started
reading it normally when I do these help
videos I haven't started reading the
books yet but this one I have because
it's my very first audio book that I'm
reading I go on like three to five mile
walks with my dog every single day she
is a high-energy breed she is a vizsla
she is only one and a half she's still
very much a puppy so now that our
weather is kind of turning warmer we try
to get outside as much as we can and
take long blocks saves me a little bit
money from having to take her to doggie
daycare to get her energy out but if we
don't do things to burn her energy
throughout the day it is just bad news
and especially when I work from home and
she's constantly all up in me and just
wanting attention it's really hard to
get work done so we've been going real
early in the morning and then in the
afternoon pending our weather because
it's been raining so much here but I
don't like to just walk and stare into
space but obviously I can't be reading a
book well hooking my dog that doesn't
work and so I finally signed up for an
audible account and the first book that
I decided to put on my phone is things
you won't say bye Sarah and this was
because it was a book that's already out
but it's still farther down on my rape
you schedule a lot of times I review
books like the day that they come out or
you know like the next day or something
like that because I get the aarc copies
of them but Sarah's was going to be a
little bit after the book was already
released and so the book was inaudible
that I was able to download and and
purchase and I just thought it would be
a really good one to read a longer book
so if it give me plenty of time to to
walk and to be able to listen to it and
I'm really really glad I did I won't get
into the full
view now because i'm sure i'll share it
in a review video but this one is a very
thought-provoking novel it is basically
the story of a white cop who shoots and
kills a Hispanic boy during a gang fight
and I mean I feel like so many of us are
already going to be aware of the police
officer issues that were that are
happening in our society today so I've
cried while walking my dog I have
started talking to myself while walking
the dog and listening to this audio book
but I'm also talking to a lot of people
about the book and I'm not even fully
done with it yet so it's going to be one
that i feel like i'm going to highly
recommend so i am about halfway through
the story right now and i'm just really
enjoying it so i wanted to include it in
this haul video because i did just
recently receive it and even though i'm
not reading it I'm listening to it and
sarah also posted on her social media
the other day the woman who was her
narrator for the audiobook is the wife
of a cop who was involved in a deadly
shooting so that kind of just like amped
it up and I just thought that was so
crazy that this is the audio book that I
chose to be my first audio book and this
is what it's turning out to be and this
is commemorated and I just thought that
was really interesting so if you're
looking for a thought-provoking read if
you're looking for a read that you know
probably be good for a book club because
it opens up a lot of discussions things
you won't say is one that I just know
that I'm going to recommend when it
comes review time those are the four
books plus my little bit of tangents
that I seem to go off on in these videos
but those are the ones that I have for
you guys this week I hope you all have a
wonderful week if you enjoyed this video
please do give it a thumbs up and
subscribe for more videos and I will
catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
