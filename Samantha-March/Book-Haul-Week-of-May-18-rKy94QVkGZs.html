going to be doing another book haul and
I have four books to talk about so
before I get into that I just want to
know who watching students from the
stars and who you think is going to win
tomorrow night because I think like the
last few weeks they've had the
eliminations on Tuesday nights and i'm
pretty sure they're doing it again but I
should probably look it up I usually
actually record the show and then I
watch it after my husband goes to bed
most nights I stay up later than him
working if I've like run errands during
the day or things like that I'll stay up
and work later but he works for like
early in the morning so he goes but
earlier so I record it so I'm not
watching yet while we're like having
family time and playing with the dog and
watching supper eating supper and all
that but then I will watch it at like
eleven o'clock at night and because I
want to watch it because I want to see
who gets eliminated live and I don't
like go online and see yet what's
happened but tuesday i might have to
just watch it in real time just so like
I know what's going on but I'm really
curious to see who wins I I mean I
really liked all three I'm kind of
pulling for Ryker because his week that
he did the Johnny Depp routine I mean it
just like sold me completely on him I
thought that routine was awesome I
thought he was so funny and how he's
stating character like the whole time
like the whole show I just thought that
was really cool so I think maybe he's
the one that's going to give my vote but
I'll just have to watch on Monday and
see who does the dances and who's the
freestyle is I'm really looking forward
to I'm really curious how knows
freestyle is going to go just because
they I think we're all curious who knows
freestyle is going to go but like every
day and so Mike how's he gonna pull this
off and he always does it's absolutely
incredible so should be a good show but
I'm really curious who watches it and
who you think is going to win so please
comment and let me know so we can talk
about it because I don't know a lot of
people that watch Dancing with the Stars
my mom does and we live in different
states I'm an Iowa and cheese in Alabama
and it's nice to be able to talk
each other about it on the phone when we
chat three times a week because that's
how much I call my mom what do you do
for the actual part of this video so I
have a book haul for books to show you
three of them are going to be on my
tablet because I got the ebooks but I do
have one print book and this is called
the art of adapting by Cassandra done
and I'm I'm really looking forward to
reading this because Cassandra actually
found me on social media and if you guys
follow me on social media especially my
author page versus my blogger page I
share so many photos of my dog her name
is Aries I mean I'm sure like literally
every day i will share at least one
picture of her because she's so funny
she cracks me up she's a year and a half
full of energy she's just such a fun dog
and Cassandra found me somehow through
the villa post because she also owns a
beach love which is the breed of our dog
she found me and she commented and just
mentioned that you know if she has a
beulas and I was going to her page and I
was looking to produce a pair of Isla
and that's kind of how we connect it
which I just think is so amazing like
how fun is that that I find a new author
a new friend a new visual owner I wrote
a blog post one time about how you know
and I'm sure it's with so many other
breeds but you're like breed-specific
you you find friends that have dogs in
that same breed and you guys are like
immediately friends I'm walking on
street and I see someone walking of Isla
or like hi oh hi your visual was destiny
or how old are they still crazy do they
have a lot of energy yes mmhmm yeah
that's just that's just how it goes
Sandra asked if she could send me her
new novel which is the art of adapting
to review on chocolate plus and I said
yes I don't know if you guys can see it
but there was a little like silhouette
of a dog and I believe that's a visual
and I thought maybe she said that
there's like there's a visual in the
story like somehow in the book there's a
vizsla involved so which I would think
if there's one on the cover that there's
power
one involved in here so I'm just looking
inside the front cover because this is
this is a real copy this is not an AR
see that was sent to me so that's nice
and a hardcover which i always think
hard covers are really cool but it looks
like we follow Lana and this is seven
months after her husband has left her
and now she is single with two teenage
children looks like she's having some
money issues her brother Matt moves in
and he has Asperger's syndrome I mean
she clearly has a lot going on and now
she has her brother moving in as well as
online says I complex smart and
genuinely moving debut novel the art of
adapting celebrates the small moments
and small changes that add up to one
bountiful life okay so this is her debut
novel oh that's so awesome ok so the art
of adapting by Cassandra done her debut
novel a fellow visual owner I love it
I'm really looking forward to reading
this one if you guys are dog owner
please comment and tell me what breed of
dog you have if there's any visual
owners i will like probably die because
visuals are not a very common breed we
just don't see or hear others having it
a lot so when i do i get that's why i
get so excited but if you feel like
you're in that club with your breed
please tell me so i don't feel like i'm
the only crazy one out here and the next
one I have is Sex Lies and cruising and
this is by Katherine Chapman and I think
the next three are all four block tours
first the elf you blog tours Sex Lies
and cruising believe this is Chiclets it
says exotic locations sexy men and crazy
crew parties Ellie has her dream dream
job or does she okay so her fiance has
cheated on her with a younger slimmer
blonde from the office mmm that's not
good he has a photography job aboard a
Caribbean cruise shed that sounds very
interesting for hours on board and she's
already shagged her sexy tech okay let
me try again cuz that mean maybe laughs
24 hours on board and she's already
shagged her sexy
Senate colleague who happens to love her
muffin top you guys the blurb is already
killing for me you guys like Chiclets
and humor this looks like a really fun
you've read so that is sex lies and
cruising by katherine chapman and that
looks to be really good and the next one
i have is the broken hearts society of
sweet 17 c and this is by leanne coppens
and this one i believe was classified
this is for seal people walk towards as
well i believe this was like a young
adult new adult novel um and it says
friends don't let friends make the same
horrible relationship mistakes twice and
looks like we follow a group of friends
looks like they're in college so it
probably would be more along like the
new adult kind of lines but looks like
there's a lot of heartbreak and in over
ice cream and pisa their first week the
girls found never again to date anyone
like the a-holes who rip their hearts
out and smeared them across the quad and
that is how the broken heart society of
sweet 17 c is born is on pre-order you
can pre-order it it goes on sale on May
22nd so it is available for pre-order on
amazon if you like new adult books which
is new adult is the genre where it's
older than young adult so your
characters are a little bit more older
they're usually like in college or just
out of college there's a lot of
different opinions on new adult some
people say new adult has to be like very
overtly sexy a lot of sex scenes and
like graphic sex scenes so I think I
when I do my research online about new
adult I see both I see you have to have
this like really sexy sexy side for a
new adult and then I see new adult just
means your characters are older so
people know that they're not reading
young adult or middle grade but they're
not reading about adult adult characters
so I've seen it both ways if you guys
are new adult readers or if you have a
opinion on what you think new adult is
please comment because I'm really
curious to see I i like to hear what
other people think about it because i do
so much marketing for books i find it
interesting and my first two books have
the main characters are college students
so i always think of these books as new
adult but then some people are like but
you don't have enough sex in your books
I'm like but they're in college so that
is the broken hearts society of sweet 17
c and the last one that i have is a
little bit different it's called
conquest and it's by steam buys you so
this is a conquest and i also have it
for sale p block tours uh if I talked
about it in a previous video I did a
review on book club by Jamie vows and
this is another pen name for Jamie she
also writes under steam buys you hope
I'm setting that right bub was more like
new adult chick lid and then this is
going to be more on the sexier romance
side from what I'm understanding and I
think this is really interesting because
the books are broken down into like
episodes so what we have for CLP blog
tours that I'm running for Jamie / steam
is the reviewers are getting episodes
one through three of conquest and if you
go to the Amazon page it says 10
delicious episodes and then it says sexy
smart chock-full of pop culture
conquests is the it series of the year
help Bree cross each item off her list
and they go through it's an older man a
younger man a teacher her boss a woman a
stranger a 3some in public make a sex
tape and dominate a man until he cries
those are the 10 episodes and like i
said i have one through three that i
will be reading and I'm really intrigued
by this idea I it's so fun to see kind
of the non-traditional books that
thurs put out like I've read books that
are written entirely in like emails and
Facebook messages and tweets and letters
and things like that and those are
really interesting and it goes so fast
like it's so quick so I have a feeling
that that's what this will be like and
it looks like four episodes one through
three which is available on amazon right
now it's 299 so 299 is basically a
pretty standard price for e-books so it
makes me think that these three episodes
will probably be pretty darn close to
what like a bowling novel would be maybe
just a little bit shorter but I don't
know yet because I haven't started
reading them but that's kind of an
interesting one I also think it's a
really good idea marketing wise for
authors because if you do something like
this and you break your series into
chunks or episodes then you know people
will read one through three and then
they're like well I have to keep reading
about what was number four how she gets
her boss and a woman and stranger those
are four through six so it will probably
make readers want to read the next ones
and then they'll go out and buy them and
I think that's a really good idea and I
think this will be really interesting to
read and like I said a little bit on the
sexier side so for those of you who
enjoy maybe a radical rotica romance
really heavy romance this one might be a
good one for you but if you tend not to
like that then that's just a warning I
mean just by reading what those episodes
are and it sounds like they get sexier
as we go on so well I'll just have to
see how it goes i'm sure i'll be posting
a review video on all of these books in
the very near future are the four books
that i have in my mailbox this week with
Chiclets plus i'm looking forward to
reading all of that all new authors to
me except for Jamie flash steam but it's
kind of like another identity of her so
that will be pretty fun to read as well
but if you think any of these books look
interesting or you'd want to pick them
up or you want to chat about dogs or
dancing with the stars
