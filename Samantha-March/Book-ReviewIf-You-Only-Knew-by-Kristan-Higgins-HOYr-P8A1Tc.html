today's video is going to be a one book
book review the book that I will be
talking about is if you only knew this
is by kristan higgins that's what the
cover looks like so I'm just going to be
giving my kind of in-depth review on
this book what I thought of the plot the
characters if I'd recommend it who i'd
recommend it to how many stars i gave it
all that good stuff so if you would like
to see my review on if you only knew
please keep watching all right driving
into it so this is if you only knew by
kristan higgins just in case you needed
a reminder let's see from the amazon
page it says the drama hilarity and
tears of sisterhood are at the heart of
the thoroughly captivating new novel by
New York Times bestselling author
kristan higgins a funny Frank and
bittersweet look at marriage forgiveness
and moving on this is a book that I
listened to via audible or listen to it
through audible on my phone while I was
out walking my dog so that is how I
listened to it I've asked to review it
and I was sent a regular like ebook a RC
copy of it I just chose to purchase it
with my own money from audible because I
thought it would be a really good one to
listen to online via a narrative and I
was right I've suffer I've made really
good choices with the audible books
because any book that I say that i buy
from audible to listen to i am buying
with my own money these are books that
are not being sent to me for review a
lot of times I am being asked to review
it and I do say yes I get sent the
regular copy but then I'm like you know
I think I'll just purchase it myself and
listen to it be audible so I don't want
to throw that one out there so this is
what I did for this one as well it takes
me a little bit longer to listen to then
would it be to read a regular book or
something on my Kindle because even
though i would say on average our walks
are like 30 to 40 minutes long and we
usually take one two or three a day but
sometimes i am calling my mom during
those times so I'm not listening to the
book sometimes and walk
my husband so okay enough about audible
that's really not interesting at all so
basically in if you only knew we follow
two characters and this is Jenny and
this is rachel and they are sisters and
they both are at a time in their life
whether going through some hard times
both very different but still they are
in the same boat that they're going
through a lot of stuff right now now for
Jenny she is a wedding dress designer
which I thought was really cool because
a lot of times in the book she has a new
store that she's opened up and she's
working with brides there's a lot of
really good subplots in there with
brides that she's designing dresses for
including one bride in particular who I
will get to in a little bit here but I
thought that was a really interesting
thing to read about but Jenny's
situation is that she is divorced from
her ex-husband and her ex-husband he is
like the greatest guy in the whole world
and he's a good doctor he's just a good
man he's a good person he didn't do
anything wrong to Jenny like he did not
she don't hurry didn't have an affair he
didn't abuse her I didn't do anything
like that he just one day basically said
you know I don't love you anymore I
don't see us being happy together and
they got a divorce and it was just a few
months later that he meets i believe
it's anna sophia and they get married
very quickly they have a baby and jenny
is very hurt by this because she just
wants to be a mother so bad like all
throughout the book that's a big part of
her is that she wants to be a mother so
bad she wanted to have children with her
husband he didn't want to that was one
of the big things in their marriage and
then he immediately remarries and has a
child with his new wife which really
hurts Jenny but kind of an interesting
twist on this is that they are all still
really good friends oh Jenny is still
like she has dinner with her ex-husband
and his new wife they like to go to
parties together like they talked to
each other on the phone and
interestingly enough Jenny actually
helps deliver the new wife's baby at the
baby shower because of course it's like
the classic
she went into labor and gave birth on
her own baby shower and jenny is the one
that helped deliver the baby I'm like
huh no like that's pretty wild so
there's that whole interesting take on
things is that even though she is
divorced from this man he's still a big
part of her life but not only key but
now his new wife and our new baby which
is constantly to me I feel like just
like rubbing salt in jenny's would like
they didn't have kids now he's got a
child and I mean whoa so she basically
is going to start over moves out of
Manhattan over to Hudson and opens up
her new wedding dress shop she's going
to be closer to her family her sister so
she just wants to try to start over and
try to move on even though it's so hard
for her to do because it's like she
always has this link to her past that
she just can't move on from which is
kind of wild because like yes it's great
to be friends with your exes in
marriages it's a little harder but if
you have children involved I get that
it's easier they didn't have children
involved so it's like why are you still
friends what do you who doesn't that
hurt every time you see them no okay so
that is Jenny then we have her sister
Rachel her younger sister Rachel Rachel
situation is is that she is married to a
successful man they have three triplet
daughters they were not able to get
pregnant for so long and they friendly
went through you know these these
treatments and got pregnant with
triplets so now they have their three
girls and pretty early on in the book it
appears evident that Rachel finds some
evidence that possibly her husband is
having an affair she confronts Adam her
husband about it it's a text message
that she found on his phone she
confronts Adam about it and you know
asks if he's having the affair and his
response is basically like how could you
think I would do that I would never do
that to you kind of like guilt trips her
into it and then of course it turns out
yes he is actually having an affair with
one of the partner
his work so we go through that I mean
that happens pretty fast in the book I
don't feel like I'm giving anything away
by saying that because that happens
pretty quickly in the book but still it
was like I just remember walking and
like my heart was pounding when she
actually figured out that he was really
having the affair and listening to him
talk and try to talk his way out of it i
just remember my heart beating so fast
because i was so mad like i was so mad
that this man tried to guilt trip his
wife into thinking that you know he
wasn't having a fair he's never done
anything wrong made her feel so bad
about herself and questioned herself and
then he really is and especially the
things that he says to Rachel about the
affair that he's having about why he did
it and how he just couldn't stop himself
and all this like oh my gosh I was so
mad and I just think that's such a mark
of good writing is when you can just
feel so many different emotions as
you're reading or listening to a story
that i felt like i was writing there in
that office but them I felt like I was
Rachel's best friend who you know felt
it in her heart to when everything was
coming into play like I felt it so I
just I can't say enough good things
about kristan higgins writing I just the
whole book to me was so good but anyways
before I get in to that as well little
spoiler um so then the rest of the book
is basically life after finding out your
husband is having an affair you know
what will Rachel do well they stay
together they now have three daughters
she hasn't worked in so long because
she's always stayed home with their
triplet girls and you know what do they
do and I just I hated Adams character I
just hated him because she would say
things like you know I'm going to leave
you I'm going to take the girls and I'm
going to leave you because I don't
believe that you're stopped having the
affair he keeps lying to her and she's
finding out his lies and his response is
back is basically like well what are you
gonna do where you gonna live you know
like you you can't make anything for
yourself basically as what he's saying
to her like you don't have a job you
probably won't be able to get a job like
what are you going to do without me like
you you can't not
me and it just infuriated me so much and
so Jenny and Rachel and their two lives
you know they come together they're
talking about their issues rachel is
leaning fairly heavily on Jenny as the
whole affair is playing out and Jenny's
trying to be the older protective big
sister and help her out there's a lot of
sister drama that also happens as well
basically because of the affair that the
night that the three characters Rachel
of Jenny and Adam get together and have
a very kind of public argument I was
just I was so mad at everybody I was mad
at everybody like I remember having so
many emotions and telling my husband
about it like can you believe that
happened he's looking at me like it's a
book like why he so worked out like my
husband I think he struggles to
understand how I get so invested into
the characters but I was I remember like
talking his ear off about it one night
which again just a mark of another great
book as these all these scenes are
playing out then we kind of have to
other subplots coming in and one is with
Jenny that she meets so she moved from
Manhattan to Hudson her new landlord is
Leo and there's some sort of connection
between her and Leo but he has a very
like mysterious past he seems very
guarded you kind of think that they're
probably going to get together but then
you're kind of like oh I don't know
because he's just a very unique
character a lot of fun to read about
then we also have another subplot with
one of Rachel's friend's one of her guy
friends is getting married and her guy
friend is like from a very successful
well known wealthy family and he's
marrying someone who doesn't fit into
that mold and there's a lot of issues
between the bride and the groom's mother
jenny is making the wedding dress Rachel
as a bridesmaid in the wedding so
they're very heavily involved in all of
this and then if all that isn't enough
there's a crazy plot twist in here that
I did not see coming and once it clicked
that it was happening I was like no way
so the flat twist I really won't get I'm
not gonna tell you what it is because I
want you to read it for yourself because
when it happened I was just like poo I'm
walking with my dog and I'm like oh my
gosh he was happening oh my gosh where
do they gonna do what is she gonna do
but basically the plot toast revolves
around Rachel and Jenny's dad who has
passed away he was involved in a murder
I guess is that the right word for it I
mean yes murder at like a gas station a
gas station was being robbed and he
happened to be in there getting
something to drink and he ended up being
one who got shot so their dad has been
passed away for several several years in
there their mom is a funny character but
at the same time I hated her too because
the mom is someone who is very like all
about me all about me and very much
making like snide and rude comments to
her daughter's all the time that I was
like oh my gosh what is wrong with this
woman but she's never been able to get
over her husband's death the plot twists
has a little bit to do about an affair
that rate or that Jenny discovered
several years back that her dad was
having an affair and then before really
anything was able to come to light he
was murdered and killed so she's kind of
always hung on to this grudge about her
dad and she's never let little stir
Jenny know because you know jenny has
all her dad is the greatest person in
the whole wide world yeah the audio so
she's never wanted to kind of taint that
version of their dad for her sister
something about that plot twist that
comes into play that I just thought oh
man it really shocked me and if you've
read the book I'd love to hear your
thoughts on it and what you thought
about that part especially but that is a
very long-winded explanation of what we
have going on in the book as I've
already said I absolutely loved it I was
always so excited to get out there and
walk with my dog because I couldn't wait
to hear what was going to happen next
again truly a mark of great writing to
me is when you feel like you are in
these
situations with the characters and you
feel like you can relate to them you
feel like they're talking to you you
feel like you could talk and they're
probably going to hear you and take your
advice you know just crazy things like
that but I was just I was so impressed
there's so much going on and the booklet
there's all these different subplots
there's all these different characters
there's all these different things going
on but it was never confusing it was
never confusing to me especially you
know sometimes even when you only have
two main characters you know sometimes
the book set up three or four it can be
a little bit more confusing but even
sometimes when you only have two
characters and you're going back and
forth especially when you're listening
to it in narration and you have the same
voice going on you know you have the
same voice in your head you're kind of
like okay this was the situation and
this was her and like it's almost can be
confusing as to what's going on I was
never confused between the two
characters as never confused at anything
as what was going on nothing ever felt
rushed to me but at the same time
nothing ever felt like it was being
drugged out that there's any situations
being drugged out the ending surprised
me in a lot of different ways there's
another kind of very smaller sub plot
twist plot twist that happens with Leo
that kind of explains a lot of things
and what happened with his character at
the end honestly I was kind of surprised
and I really wasn't sure where that was
going and then I thought I was going in
one direction and then it flipped and
one in another and I wasn't mad about it
and then especially with Rachel I had no
idea I had I truly had no idea what she
was going to do if she was going to be
able to move on from the affair if Adam
was really ever going to end any of his
affairs I just thought he was like the
slimmest of all slimy creatures and I
just really had no idea where that
family was going to end up and then I
was really excited I mean it is a
smaller sub plot but I was excited to
see about the wedding with Rachel's
friend and Jenny's client that she's
making the dress for I was really
wondering how that wedding was going to
come to play if there's going to be any
more twist their surprises along the way
there kind of is but overall I mean I
give it a five star review I
I loved it is one I very highly
recommend if you can get it on audible I
