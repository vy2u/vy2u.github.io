is Samantha March and I'm with Chiclets
plus this is my second video the first
video has not even gotten up yet on
YouTube I'm still trying to figure out
all the workings and editing I don't
have any fancy software yet or would
even know what to do with it if I did so
I'm just using the YouTube Video Creator
to turn my video and things like that so
hopefully that will be up by the time by
the end of the day maybe I'm filming on
Tuesday so I felt it from first video
yesterday and I have just a little bit
of time before I have to leave so I
thought I would try to do another video
real quick I uploaded the first one last
night so I filmed in the afternoon and I
started working on it last night it took
all night to upload this video I had no
idea it was gonna take that long so I
thought I have some time you know since
I don't have any fancy lights I'm
recording my office has a huge window so
that is what is right in front of me
because if I try to film any later it's
just gonna be dark and you won't be able
to see me so I thought I have a few
minutes I put my dog outside and I'm
gonna try to record this real fast so
before I leave I can start the upload
process so maybe it'll be faster so
lessons learned I'm sure this is gonna
be a huge learning experience for me but
I'm having fun with it so far so we'll
see how it goes so the first video I
wanted to talk a little bit about the
books that I will be reviewing on
chiclet plus this week I will be
reviewing three I reviewed one yesterday
on Monday I have one coming out on
Wednesday and I think Friday is my next
one but I have an amazing team of
reviewers on chocolate plus so we
usually post between either 1 or 2
reviews a day but but several growths
throughout the week I can't really talk
about the review is that they will be
doing because I of course haven't read
the book and I don't know what their
thoughts are yet so the reviews that
I'll be doing on here will just be for
the books that I have read of course so
again like I said there are three the
review that I posted
on Monday of this week was for playing
all the angles by Nicola Lane and I
should mention real quick the majority
of the books that I read and review our
ebooks publishers don't really send out
a lot of print books basically the only
print books that I receive are from like
the traditional publishing companies st.
Martin's and Penguin things like that
they're usually the arc copies that come
out but you know just these days
everything is a lot of e-books which is
fine for me because as a reviewer it
actually really helps because I can take
my Kindle anywhere you know I can read
it on the treadmill things like that so
it's just a lot easier for me as a
reviewer to have those ebooks but I love
getting the print books if I if I ever
am talking about a book that I have a
print copy of I'll be here enjoying it
and excited about it but I'm gonna
hopefully find a way to like put the
cover in this video I have no idea if I
can do it the first video when I was
editing I managed to put a speech bubble
in because I screwed up at one point I
called my phone like a GS or something
like that it's the galaxy s6 so I put a
little speech bubble in there saying
that but I don't know if I can put a
cover and we'll see but so that's a
quick thing about the books I'll talk
about I will really try hard to somehow
put the covers in here we'll just see
how it goes if anyone knows how to do
that please tell me because I would love
to know but anyway so the first book
that I reviewed was playing all the
angles by Nicole Lane it was a romance
book and I reviewed it for my to
accompanies the LP block tours
I loved the cover it was kind of racy
and saucy I started reading it the main
character is Eve and I thought why am i
reading this book I'm gonna hate it I
can't believe someone wrote a book about
a character who is so cruel she's
sleeping with her sister's boyfriend I'm
gonna hate this book and I keep reading
it and there's three sisters and Eve is
kind of like the black sheep of the
family she's got two sisters one is just
terrible you know she's really need to
Eve back and then there's Isabella and
she's a great person she's super nice
she's always friendly to Eve she tries
keep the family together and of course
that's who is sleeping with Isabelle's
boyfriend and I just thought I'm gonna
hit this book you know you want to like
it the characters that you're reading
about and the majority of the book is
about Eve and I got maybe like 20% in
and I thought I need to separating this
because that's just gonna suck and I get
so mad when I don't like books um so but
I kept reading and thank goodness I did
because I ended up really loving the
book it all makes sense once you keep
going and and once you see Eve's flaws
but you keep reading and you and you
understand there's a lot of family
backstory in here and once you started
peeling back the layers and uncovering
what was happening in the family I
couldn't put the book down I was truly
fascinated by it there's some oh it's
just it was so good I think I gave it a
four point five out of five star rating
I'm chiclet plus and I just highly
recommend this book I couldn't believe I
was just so happy that I didn't stop
because of how Eve's character was that
I kept going with it because it it was
really good so I I do really recommend
that one the next review I'll be doing
is for confetti confidential they do I
don't
and it's by Susan Murphy and this was
first to help you block tours as well
when I picked up this book I thought it
would be Chiclets because the cover I
had a very Chiclets feel to it it was
about weddings and I just thought it was
gonna be Chiclets all the way it really
wasn't but that didn't stop me from
enjoying it you know once I kind of read
the blurb you know I maybe thought maybe
this isn't gonna be exactly what I'm
expecting there was a lot of chocolate
elements to it but it was I think it was
a more mature read then sometimes
chocolate can be you know there there is
a woman Biff who her marriage is falling
apart
you know she's separating from her
husband she's she's having a lot of
difficulties with um she's a wedding and
in the book I believe that authors
Australian so sometimes the wording I'm
like what are you saying again but she
was a wedding celebrant which I believe
is and like an officiant for
letting in us terms and she decides that
she's not gonna do it anymore because
she's so just down on her luck she's
getting divorced you know how can she
officiate these weddings but she decides
she has 10 weddings left to do and she's
going to get through each wedding so it
was kind of fun because each wedding
kind of got detailed in the book and
some of them were super funny to read
about and so that was a lot of fun and
what I also thought was really
interesting was the love story because I
really didn't know what was gonna happen
she had her husband who you know of
course makes to come back like they all
do at one point she has her best friend
who you know you kind of think maybe
there's something with them and then he
goes away and you think maybe not and
then if there's another guy I really had
no idea until the end of the book what
was gonna happen and who she was gonna
end up with and it was really fun to
read along the way I think I haven't
written the review yet but I think I'll
do a four star cuz I really enjoyed it
the last one that I'm reviewing is an
anthology actually and it's called fools
rush in it was in april foolís
anthology I know I'm a little late on
posting my review but our schedule was
just so busy that mid-april was the best
I could do trying to get it as close to
April first as I could but this is from
several authors
I think there's eight authors in total
who they each have a real short story in
there I actually read this I was
recently on vacation in Orlando with my
husband and I read this on the plane a
little bit in the hotel room somebody
the pool I thought it was a great
vacation read and each story was was so
short and snappy and I thought it was
really good I'm not a super huge fan of
like anthologies are not even just
anthologies but short stories or
novellas you know sometimes I feel like
I can't get as into them as I would a
folding a novel because it's so hard and
especially in this anthology the the
stories are so short I mean it could
literally take me like maybe a half an
hour to read one of the short stories
and sometimes I'm kind of left at the
end like what just happened who did what
but with that thrown out there I will
give this a four star review it not five
because just simply because the short
stories just really aren't my thing but
this one was really good it was really
cute I don't think it needs to be read
you know simply around April Fool's Day
each story you know revolved around
April Fool some of them had April Fool's
joke there was one really funny one I'm
not gonna even think of which one the
author was but it was a workplace
setting it people are playing April
Fool's jokes on each other I thought
that one was super cute I thought that
was so funny I'm really mad that I can't
think of the author but I'll think of it
later um and maybe try to post it in
here for you
so those are the three books that I will
be reviewing I hope you will review or
read the reviews on check lip plus I'll
try to link to them in the video as well
I also did kind of want to just touch on
what I'm reading right now it's called
the Royal we and it's by oh it's two
authors I'm probably gonna mix up their
names
it's Heather Cox and Jessica Morgan I
think it is possibly and I'll try to
show the cover for you as well it
basically looks like William and Kate
and it's about you know it's it's very
much about the human gate story except
you know that of course there are the
differences
Rebecca is actually from America and she
comes to study in in London and that's
where she earned England and that's
where she meets William and you know
there's it's not the full story
Nicholas is the prince his mom is still
around there's actually a really
intriguing backstory on the mom in that
book and so far I'm about I think 70% in
it's really long I think I've been
reading this for like two days which is
really unusual for me and I'm still it's
probably gonna take me another at least
one day if not two to get through so
it's really long but it's really funny I
love the royal family I'm such a huge
fan I was awake at four I had and when
William and Kate got married and I
watched the wedding on TV
so anything to do with the Royals I'm
watching the show on he called the
Royals I think it's hilarious I love it
I'm totally hooked so I enjoyed this
book I just wish it moved a little bit
faster maybe it was shorter that's all
and then one more last piece of exciting
news so today as I'm filming is Tuesday
the 14th and a marching and book has
released that is the publishing company
that I own and one of my own novels is a
part of it it's a multi author
collection it has three novels each are
full-length novels the other authors on
there are cat Lavoie and Laura Chapman
and it's breaking the rules from cat and
hard hats and doormats from Laura and my
third novel a questionable a friendship
so they're all in this collection and
right now it's on sale it's for a dollar
ninety-nine for the week of release so
for two dollars you get three books so
that's like a huge savings so if you
want to pick it up that would be amazing
I'm sure I'll find a way to post a link
below to the Amazon page it is it's only
gonna be an e-book for right now and
it's exclusive on Amazon right now as
well so that's the only place you can
get it as long Amazon as an e-book but
I'll post those links below cuz it's an
exciting day it's our first multi author
collection from marching Inc and
hopefully everyone likes it the the
three novels that are in the book are
all on sale separately as well but it's
a much better deal right now if you buy
them in the collection because you'll
save some money so that is I'm talking
about for the second video I hope I
didn't make it too long and now I can
probably ramble once I start talking
about books that I really do need to
leave so I need to wrap this up
hopefully we got it all in one take
because I don't know if I will have time
to refill for the next few days but I
hope you enjoyed this video I hope I can
make a few more for you this week and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
