week and it is going to be another
review video talking about the three
books that I'm reviewing on chocolate
plus this week kind of giving you my
thoughts into them the first one is
called the other wife by Kathleen Irene
peterka i think i'm saying that right
maybe i'm not i'm going to try to show
you the cover again on the tablet i hope
you guys can see it um this book you
should probably go read it right now I
loved this book from the very first page
I couldn't put it down I read it in like
a day day and a half maybe because it
was so intriguing to me so the there's
there's two women there's Eleanor and
Claire both are married to the same man
my mind's already like racing like how
did this man do it is he falsely married
to one of them you know what's going on
he dies he dies very suddenly he has
like a heart attack in his sleep he dies
and then after he dies Eleanor who's
been married to him for you know ever
that she finds out that he that she is
not on his will anymore she's basically
not really going to get anything because
he signed everything over to Claire he
has children with Claire yes children
with Eleanor oh my gosh I was so
invested in this book you guys I just
really hope you can go get it I really
had no idea how the ending was going to
play out like how do these two women
come together what do they do when they
come together and the way that it
happened was absolutely nothing that I
thought of in my head and it was so much
better and I can't say enough good
things about this book I gave it a five
star review i'll link it below and
basically just saying the same things
over and over like i love this book
please i hope you go get it book let's
see if I can pull it up on this tablet
that I still am trying to figure out how
to even work this thing but it's called
secrets in the sky and it's by pauline
wiles secrets in the beasts guy that's
what i typed that'll get me far fun i
read for sale people walk towards i did
with Kathleen's as well and seekers in
the sky I read Pauline's book that it's
called um saving saffron's tweeting and
I've read that one also and then this
book secrets in the sky takes place two
years prior to that novel here it is can
you see it stickers on this guy um so
that takes place two years before it
both can be read as a standalone just
kind of fine to go back it's a quaint
little town small town type thing so
it's kind of fun to read about but in
this one we follow Sophie and it's kind
of funny because she kind of has a lot
of Lies going on but not you know she's
not trying to be a bad person I I don't
dislike her she's got reasons for why
she is making up of these tall tales
some mr. protect people that she loves
the her big one oh it's just so funny I
don't want to give too much away and
what I'm talking about because I just
had such a fun time reading the book
she's a really funny character she gets
into a love triangle did I was really
intrigued about I thought the love
interest for a really really
well-written boyfriend who makes a
comeback after Sophie's aunt dies and
leaves her a bunch of money all of a
sudden this ex-boyfriend is back and you
slowly can tell that he wants things
from her he wants her to be his business
partner and and all these other things
and then she's got the other love
interest who is a part of one of the
lies that she is leading more the big
lies that she's leading in her life and
he kind of has a big role in that and so
it's really it was really interesting to
read I thought it was a really cute read
it's a pretty fast one so I definitely
would recommend that one to you too
because I just had a lung a lot of fun
reading it I would also say the first
book saving saffron speeding and I can
link both the
links below in the box but I've really
broken my both of those up there cute
chick lit book so i would say give that
one a go and then the last book that i'm
going to talk about is the royal we and
i mentioned this in a previous video
that i was currently reading it and I
kind of like wasn't sure what was going
on and what I would think the book but
this is the Royal we you can see that
it's by heather cox and jessica morgan
um this one and i mentioned before that
I'd look I'm a huge fan of the Royals
I'm still like Kate let's make this baby
happen because I'm dying to know if it's
a boy or a girl i can't wait i'm
watching the news frantically not
wanting to miss a moment of that so I
thought I would just totally love this
book I haven't actually written my
review yet so I'm kind of just thinking
of thoughts as they pop out of my head
but the only problem that I had with
this book is that it was super long it
took me it took me like four or five
days to read and it does not take me
that long to read a book and sometimes
it just seemed like certain situations
were so dragged out that I was like why
are we reading about this let's just get
to the good parts people so that was
really just my main problem with the
book is that it was just so long but I
really enjoyed it you know it it really
is kind of like a spoof on William and
Kate you know a regular girl falling in
love with the Prince of Wales and what
they have to go through but it was
really interesting to read some parts
because you know some things that are
said like makes my mind start whirling
like in the book after she gets engaged
to him in the book the Prince's name is
Nick and her name is Rebecca or she goes
by box after they get engaged and she
starts doing all these royal appearances
she slowly has a hair extensions being
put in so she has this like thick
beautiful brown hair and I'm like what
you got going on Kate you don't have
fake hair do you that was like devastate
me if I realized Kate had hair extension
her hair is amazing let's get serious
and my hair
is you don't even want to see what my
hair looks like today I just threw this
in a braid because I was gonna scare
everyone if I just left it loose and
down I didn't even want to attack it
with a curling iron because I went to
bed with it like slightly damp and woke
up and it's like so this is what we got
working with today I'm no Kate Middleton
but really I read that part about the
hair extensions and I was just like hmm
that's really interesting and their
scenes with the becks and Nick's brother
that I'm like interesting and there's
things with bex and her sister that
happened and you know I obviously the
rows are so tight-lipped we'd never
really know what's going on with them
they only put out there what they want
to be put out there I truly loved those
parts but it made my mind like diddle is
it I wonder if that really happened I
wonder if this could happen I wonder you
know that was a lot of fun so it got my
my mind working i got my thoughts
rolling I loved all the royal parts of
it and thought that was super fun I
think I'll give it a four-star review
and really my only downfall was that it
was really long but I think it'd be
really cool if they did it like another
one continuing to follow their lives and
how it is to be royal and the babies and
all that so so yeah that's my thoughts
on the the royal we I I hope you'll give
it a read especially if you really do
like the Royals because I think you
could find it really interesting and I'm
really curious to hear anyone's thoughts
about what certain parts like mine was
the hair extensions is there any certain
parts that you thought like wait what
that can't be true or can it I would
love to hear those from you so that is
all I have today just those three
