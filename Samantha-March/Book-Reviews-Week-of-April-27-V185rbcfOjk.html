doing a review video this week for books
to review so it's a very busy week so
I'm just going to go ahead and jump
right into it the first review that I'm
doing yo country boneyard and it's by
Susan lawyer and I think my dog wants to
say hello okay look here she is say
hello hello hello okay good time and I'm
back okay so like I was saying the first
book is for low country boneyard and
it's by susan Boyer and the low country
is actually a series there's low country
boil and then Lowcountry bombshell and
then the one that I'm reviewing this
week is low country boneyard this series
so this is what the book looks like um
this series is mystery and it's the
series name is al is tail bat mystery
and I love a good mystery book I like
I'm all about Chiclets and I like
romance and I like women's fiction but I
have a very special place in my bookish
heart for mysteries especially when
they're not like really like thriller
suspenseful people are like being gouged
and mmm all that I don't like that but
these these type of mysteries like
Lowcountry boneyard and the whole list
tale about series I love basically
you're following Liz who um you follow
Liz who's a private investigator and
through each book you're following her
through a certain mystery this one
happens to be sushi is searching for a
missing person in one of Charleston's
oldest families so a very rich family a
very powerful family the daughter goes
missing and it's up to Liz to try to
find her and at the mystery part was so
good I'm of course not going to give
away the ending
but the ending actually surprised me how
the missing person how it kind of all
came together I was surprised and I
loved it there's obviously there's some
romance in there liz is having a
struggle with she's really in love with
her man but they can't agree upon which
city they're going to live in so you
kind of are watching them struggle
through that and then there's also a
ghost ah and i love the ghost and it's
not like a silly ghost story that you're
like why is this girls are involved the
ghost is liz's friend who has passed
away and it's super cute it's super
awesome the way that she's writing is so
good and her goal like her mission for
being in the books I think it is really
good to a lot of good parts with her so
I actually gave this one a five star
review I really enjoyed the other books
in the series too i highly highly
recommend this series if you like you
know some light mysteries like almost
kind of like Chiclets mysteries type I I
definitely would recommend these books
because i think they are super fun the
next ones i'm a reviewing our again a
series and i actually read both books
one and two are out now the third book
is not out yet the series name is the
accidental series the author is Celia
Kennedy the first book in the series is
Charlotte's restrained and I never know
what side like NAT is going to have a
glare so we try to show you on both so
this is the first book in the accidental
series and it's called Charlotte's
restrained the accidental stalker and
the series so I've also read the second
book and it follows a group of friends a
large group of girlfriends kind of just
as following their stories and we kick
off with Charlotte who really wants to
meet a certain celebrity and she gets to
meet him and the way that they meet is
pretty funny and not only that but then
she kind of like keeps running into him
and certain
situations that are accidents like she's
the accidental stalker and then it kind
of looks like she is stocking him she
has a restraining order and it's funny
it's totally laugh out loud it's it was
it was self under read I love books
about friends and about especially
groups of girlfriends and I love when
series follows each friends in the books
because then you you know you're already
starting to get to know everybody and
then you just get to know everyone more
and I think that is so so cool this one
I would definitely recommend i loved it
i think i'm gonna give it like 4.5 maybe
even five star review what am I going to
do I don't know I haven't written the
review yet so usually I get some ideas
as I'm starting to write everything out
so that is that one and then the next
one that i read from the series and i
read it i love being able to read series
back to back and that's what i was able
to do with this one so the next one is
kathleen's undressed pants and large the
cover this is kathleen's undress tub so
this one we're obviously following
Kathleen and I thought it was
interesting that we were following
Kathleen next because she was one of the
characters in the first book that I
didn't feel was really like touched on a
lot so I was kind of surprised that we
were getting Kathleen story next but
then i also thought that's brilliant
because I in my opinion I don't feel
like we heard a lot from Kathleen in the
first book so I was like me now we get
to know about her as i'm reading the the
synapses it talks about how Kathleen has
secrets dark secrets her friend would be
devastated to learn and I'm thinking I
wonder what those are I wonder what it
would be and we start to follow the book
she meets a man and they have this whole
love story but she kind of keeps hinting
back to these secrets that she had all
the girlfriends are involved again and I
thought the beginning was really good
because of the beginning
catch up on each individual character
like before I just jumped into Kathleen
story little snippets from each other
girlfriends lives so you could kind of
like ketchup and see what was going on
and then we went into Kathleen's story
so I thought that part I thought that
was really cool like total kudos Cecilia
for writing it that way so I thought
that was awesome fun mm-hmm I'm usually
typically a fan of first books in series
that's just kind of the way I am I
always seem to gravitate towards them
more and I like them more and that's the
same same case here which didn't
surprise me at all really love the first
book the second book I thought maybe was
just a little bit slower then the first
one I wasn't reading it as fast type of
thing and not totally unusual for me but
I still really enjoyed it i loved the
romance and how that aspect worked out
the secret that she's hiding I'm not
going to tell you what those are of
course um but the secrets that she's
hiding I don't know when they said like
she had really deep dark secrets I was
kind of like oh I wonder what those
secrets are and my mind is like running
about what she could have done and I did
think they were like to deepen dark I i
get i get it and i get the secrets I get
why she kept them I liked how she was
able to tell her friends and her mom
kind of plays a role in that too and I
thought that was really well written but
I was just kind of like all that wasn't
as bad as I was expecting I don't know
what that says about me maybe that I
don't know i mean my third book is
called a questionable a friendship a
little little my own self-promotion here
going on but and then that book i feel
like they have some pretty deep dark
secrets in there so maybe that's kind of
what I was expecting but overall still
very good book really enjoyed it I'm so
excited for the third one in the series
to come out and I hope Celia tells me
right away when it does because I will
want to read it so definitely a cute
series to start with fourth and final
book trying to make this as fast as I
can especially because my dog still in
my office she's trying
on a bond but I don't know and she's
going to want to make another appearance
next one I actually can't say a whole
lot yet because I'm still reading it my
review is doing like three days I'm like
oh my god and I just started today
that's so bad I this weekend was kind of
busy so I wasn't able to do as much
reading as I was would have liked one is
called book club and it's by Jamie Faust
boost boast I don't know this is this is
probably one of the hardest part about
the YouTube channel is getting people's
names right because I've never had to
pronounce them before I've always just
had to write them down so I'm like I
sang this right eek eek ok so I just
started this one like three hours before
i'm recording this video and i'm already
twenty one percent in which isn't too
bad so i think it's going to be a really
quick read but basically what it's about
is these friends and they've started a
book club and not only is it a book club
where they read books and they talk
about the book but they also try to like
help each other with their dreams and
ambitions and if they have problems and
they're really good at talking about
things like that so that's kind of where
I've gotten so far and we're just like
slowly I'm starting to meet the
characters read theirs okay I did read
that thus there's a sister thats just
kind of entered the story I just started
the part where she comes in and she
really starts to shake up the group like
she's telling people like your group
really isn't getting all that in depth
like you're reading these self-help
books and you're trying to help each
other but you're really not there's you
know one girl has a cheating husband
that everyone's like fairly confident
one of the girls has even seen him
cheating on her but no one will say that
out loud to her so it's like yes they're
trying to help each other but they tread
very very carefully and then this sister
shows up and it's like I got you guys
let me tell you what's wrong with you
and that part i just read she was just
like
this is wrong with you and this is wrong
with you and this is what you need to do
and thank goodness I'm here and I'm like
okay I'm probably gonna like you I'm
excited like I said I'm only twenty
percent in so I can't give my full
review yet oh it does say in the
synopsis that there's something to do in
the book what the disappearance of
people's sexiest man alive which i think
is really funny like I am excited to see
how this turns out those are the four
books for book club I'll be sure to link
my review my review should be up by the
time this video goes up so I'll link my
full review in the box below so you can
check it out and see what else I thought
about the book but another really great
week of book reviews those two series
that I talked about I really hope you
can go pick up and I'll have my full
review on book club coming shortly so
that's all for this video so until next
time I hope you enjoyed this video and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
