video is going to be another review
video and I have a lot of books to talk
about because i haven't done one
recently but before I jump into that I
just want to say I really hope this
video quality comes out okay I record
they fly in my office and it's driving
me insane forward in front of my big
window in my office and usually it's
like bright and sunny when I record and
it just helps with the quality so i
don't know about lighting we have had
rainy stormy severe weather for what
feels like a week I mean it probably has
been weak and I have looked at our
forecast for the next few days it's all
cloudy and rain and gross and I'm like
okay but I really need to record a video
so I have the flash on the video and
then I have my office later on as well
which both those things I normally don't
have on because it's usually so bright
in my office hoping this it turns out
okay and I don't go blind from staring
into this bright light after so on but
jump right in the first book is called
french coast and it is by anita hughes
the time this video goes up all my
reviews will already be on chocolate
plus so i will link all of my reviews
below they'll try to make this a little
bit of a faster video since I have so
many books to talk about I probably
won't go as in depth into all of them
the Hughes is one of my favorite authors
if you haven't read anything by her I
highly suggest you do i highly suggest
french coast i absolutely loved it i
gave it five stars anita is an author
who i think has such the ability to put
you into her story and then take you on
the journey with her characters and
french coast was no exception and i
loved it because it has that chiclet
feel to it you know it has a daughter of
a politician who was about to marry
up-and-coming politician himself a
scandal gets broke out and she heads to
the French coast for her job it's to
interview he gets to interview a very
famous like X
her of French Vogue so there's a lot of
fashion involved which i think is a lot
of fun she meets someone along the way
she first meets a woman and be friends
her and there's kind of a mysterious
part to this gal and she also meets a
man and there's a very big mystery with
the man that she meets her family is
kind of going through something there's
so much going on and I don't really know
how to say it so I'm not giving anything
away but it was fantastic and there was
a part in the novel kind of more towards
the end that I read it and I looked like
this to the point where I was sitting on
the couch my husband was on the chair
watching TV and he looks over at mean
he's like are you okay I'm like wait
what just happened in this book so good
French coast by nida Hughes if you
haven't read anything by her please do
and especially this one I thought it was
really great and that i reviewed is
Irene in college by Lori Goldson fine
i'll i'll be honest i save this in my
review to the cover didn't exactly grab
me the cover didn't stick out to me or
even really give me an idea of maybe
like what i was going to read I won't
say that I judge a book by the cover to
the point where I won't read something
if I don't think that I am going to
enjoy it just based on the cover alone
but I do kind of go into the story with
an idea like if I don't totally love the
cover I can you know I might not love
this book but you know I'm i always like
to give her everything a chance and
that's kind of how I felt with this book
and I'm really glad that let's fly
though I am really glad that I gave it a
chance because I actually ended up
really enjoying the story ah so we fall
out Irene who was in college if you
couldn't have guessed that from the
title but she's kind of going through a
lot with her family especially with her
mother who was having some certain
health issues she has a relationship
going on that maybe isn't quite the best
thing for her she has a fur
chip with a roommate that is kind of
funny to read about because they're very
different people and they are really
best friends and roommates but they're
so different that you're kind of like
how does this work I thought that there
were really funny moments in the book
but there were also very serious moments
in the book domestic violence is touched
on mental health issues are talked about
so you kind of get a wide array of
topics in this novel and I thought that
was very interesting I thought it was
very well written I get a velour
Eagleson major kudos for how she wrote
this book because I thought it was easy
to follow I thought it was very well
paced and I thought the characters were
about one-dimensional characters even
the couple of main characters that we
kind of followed not just Irene but
other people in her life too they were
all very well written and so on a whole
I was very impressed with this book and
I gave it a 4 star review and the next
one that I read was the silver cord by
Alison quiola and if you have seen some
of my other videos where I talk about
Alison and the first book in this series
which is the seeds of a daisy you know
that I was like super super excited to
read this book and oh my gosh I mean I
don't even really know where to start
with this one because it is very
different from the seeds of a daisy sow
the seeds of a daisy makes may slay hmm
make up my own words basically follows a
mother-daughter relationship in a very
serious car accident there's family
secrets that it get uncovered though we
follow Lily Lockwood and it's you know
her mother who was fun in the accident
but we also follow her life as an
actress and her as going through her
relationships and you know trying to
find that mr. right and she's dating an
actor she meets a doctor all these sort
of things and then we pick up I believe
it's two years later we pick up in the
silver cord and basically so at the end
of the seeds of a daisy Lily falls in
love with Robbie who was a doctor
and he is going to be leaving he works
in like a doctors with borders type of
association where he goes to not as well
off countries and and works there for
like years at the time he knew he was
going to be gone for about two years and
then in this story Robbie has been
kidnapped again there's a whole like
terrorists theme throughout the book and
Lily gets involved and they're trying to
to save him from these terrorists and I
mean it was a totally totally different
story from the first book and honestly
it's not quite what I expected I read
the blurb room was kind of like okay so
terrace kidnapping that's interesting I
wonder what's going to happen but I
don't think I like quite fully expected
what we were going to get and I mean it
does go into some pretty gruesome
details about what happens to Robbie
while he is a prisoner and being held
captive and there's a lot of like the
CIA is involved in navy seals and I'm
reading this and it was like it was like
an action book it was it was so much fun
to read about I told Allison you know
that I thought her book was so well
researched and in my point of view I
thought it was very well written you
know i'm not totally up to date on the
CIA and the Navy SEALs and how things go
about from but from as a reader's point
of view I thought everything flowed
really well everything made sense to me
and I absolutely love it and it gave her
so much props for writing this book
because I just thought it was so much
fun to read it literally was like a
chiclet adventure book so awesome so
that is the silver cord by Allison
caiola I gave it five stars along with
the first one in the series which is the
seeds of a daisy I highly recommend both
of those the next one that I read is
from Nikki wells and it's called seven
years bad sex and Nikki I will say that
I pretty much consider Nikki a friend we
have worked together in a
setting for years i fried all up bridger
brought all of her bugs I think she is
such a fabulous writer she's so much fun
to talk to online I really hope one day
like she's someone who I would just
absolutely love to meet if you haven't
read anything by Nikki I highly suggest
you do because Chiclets books are so
much fun to read and she sent me the
information on seven years bad sex and I
thought okay and I kind of thought I was
going to read about a couple that
struggles in their marriage for seven
years and it would kind of take us
through their seven years of marriage
and how much they're struggling and how
this kind of thing it's not like that at
all no it's not like that at all I will
say ah there is a lot of sex in the book
so this is definitely for a more mature
audience only and I'll try not to get
too detailed in my review here but it
basically follows a couple who gets
married and once they get married they
can't have sex on their wedding night
they're just too tired and I just can't
can't do it literally and they go to
sleep and then there's all these crazy
things that happened for why they can't
seem to have sex like seasickness is one
of them that's kind of a funny part of
the story and there's just little things
that keep getting in the way people
interrupting them people getting sick in
one thing that i found was really funny
she tries to wear a costume for him
thinking it would like kind of help
their situation and it turns out she is
allergic to like the rubber latex that
she's wearing it ends up in the hospital
and that's kind of funny he tries taking
pills that he gets off the internet and
of course that ends badly but there's
one scene where I was laughing so hard
because the bed broke and the roof was
caving in and the bathtub was going
through the floor and I
remember as in the bathroom and this is
in my review I'm in the bathroom doing
my eye makeup my makeup in general and
reading because i liked multitask and i
was laughing so hard I smudge my
eyeliner all over my face because it was
one of the funniest scenes that I've
read and so I put that in my review and
Nikki caught that real fast and when she
was tweeting about the review she made
sure to put that part in there because I
was like seriously you rumba makeup
girlfriend is super funny it is you know
can get graphic at times because it
basically is a book about people trying
to have sex and things that they do so
um I do recommend that you be older to
read this book but it's really funny I i
highly recommend it along with any of
Nikki's books because she's such a good
writer and she is super funny the next
one thought I read is the art of baking
blind and this is by Sarah Vaughn and
this book this was a book that from
reading like the very first chapter the
very few for the very few first pages I
was like yes I'm gonna like this book
and this is going to be hard to put down
and it was it's definitely a foodie book
which I've mentioned in my videos before
that like I'm a huge fan of food ebooks
even though I can't bake or cook to save
my life this book definitely made me
want to try to bake and I got on
Pinterest well like while I was reading
the book I got like a big pinterest itch
and went on it was like painting all
these crazy recipes that I know I'll
never be able to do in my lifetime but
that's what book did to me it made me
want to try i was very interesting
because it has it follows a baking
competition and all of the competitors
in the competition and kind of covers
their backstories why they want to be in
the competition with their home life is
like and that sort of thing but then
what I really loved is the baking
competition that they're in is to find
the new mrs. Eden she definitely was
like an icon and in the book she has
passed away and they're trying to find
the new mrs. Eden so that is what the
baking competition is for but we follow
several women and then
man in the competition as well we don't
really get a lot of his backstory it's
mostly only the women that we're
learning about and so we follow it that
way and it's divided into sections on to
each part of the banking competition
that they're doing and the part that I
think that I kind of liked the most was
that we also get point of views from
mrs. Eden or her first name is Kathleen
every once in a while she has a little
part in there and you slowly start to
piece together what her life was like
and she's known as this like perfect
icon with her perfect family with her
perfect career with her perfect life and
as you read through it you know
obviously she doesn't have that she had
a lot of struggles with being able to
have children and suffering through many
miscarriages and towards the end we
learned something about her family life
and about her children that really
caught me off guard it very much
surprised me but I absolutely loved it I
I have a real fondness for books that
take place in the past and the present
and we can move between them and that's
exactly what this book delivered and I
thought that was great my only problem
with it is that we were kind of
following so many different women who
have different lives I kind of got them
mixed up every once in a while and I
would think like jenny was Karen but
maybe Karen is Vicki and I was like wait
who what she is she the one with the hut
no hmm and that was my only impart that
sometimes it kind of tripped me up and I
had to like really think about who I was
reading about but I gave it a 4.5 star
review on Chiclets plus and i highly
recommend it i really really enjoyed it
so that's the art of baking blind by
sarah vaughn and the next one I have
this is going to be the last one I'm
gonna go through but this is called
deadly race and it's by elk Fiore p or a
hmm i don't know if i'm saying that
right actually now that I think of it I
just go ahead and say and I'm like oh I
don't know if that's right but this is
booked to in the deadly series and I
have read the first one which is called
deadly bloodlines and I really loved it
and I was excited to read deathly
race and the books take place in the
Cayman Islands which is where elkus from
which I just think it's how cool they
are very much mystery books and this one
kind of it this book follows Remy a
female and she really wants to be a race
car driver and the book kind of follows
her struggles as being accepted as a
female race car driver and kind of the
issues that she goes with along with
that but then of course the the mystery
starts almost right away with the owner
of the race car track being shot and
killed and remy is basically being
framed for it she gets arrested for it
because the murder weapon is found in
her car but the book follows rummy not
only trying to clear her name but trying
to find out who did it and trying to
save the race car track now in the
Cayman Islands because no one wants to
to lose that and what I really enjoyed
about this novel is very quick i read it
and i think a day I mean it didn't take
me long to read it all of us very fast
it was very well written it was very
suspenseful so you wanted to keep
reading but what I liked is at the end I
thought I had figured out the mystery
and I thought it was just going to be
wrapped up and we were just going to get
a nice little ending and it turned out
not to be like that I actually was wrong
and there was more to the story and you
just had to keep reading to figure it
all out um Jackson is kind of Ramiz love
interest in the book and he also has
some scenes in the first book so it was
neat to see how they tied together so so
far I'm really enjoying I know there is
a third book coming from this series and
I'm hoping that I'll be able to read it
because I have a soft side for mysteries
as well especially ones that aren't like
super gory bloody like move no I don't
really like those as much but these kind
of mysteries I really enjoy like yes
there's murder and all that but it
doesn't go into like the specifics of
that stuff because then I'll just have
nightmares mystery series if you are
three bands i would recommend that you
check them out so that was deadly race
by elk Fiore and I give it 4.5 stars on
Chiclets plus so those are all the books
I don't even know how many i did like
six or seven maybe so those are the ones
that i'm reviewing if you check in the
description box below i will have my
links to my full reviews on Chiclets
plus plus the amazon links for them as
well if you do want to check any of them
out if you like this video and you want
to see some more review videos please
give this a thumbs up I will try to be
making them as fast as I can hopefully
the weather improves so I don't have to
make another video and the dark I really
hope you guys can see me in this video
and that's all I have so until next time
