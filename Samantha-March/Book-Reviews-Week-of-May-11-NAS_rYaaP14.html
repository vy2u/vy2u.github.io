doing a review video today and i
actually didn't post one last week so
today's video is going to be for the
books that chicklet plus had on the site
last week and reviewed laugh strike so
kind of playing a little bit of catch-up
here but i have i have like two full
books to talk about 1 i'm in the process
of reading and one got reviewed on
chiclet plus but not by me but i
actually have read the book so kind of
kind of a lot going on so let's just
jump into it the first book that I have
to review and I know I'm going to
slaughter like every single name known
to man when it comes to this book so
just like bear with me but the book is
called stages and thieves I at least can
get that part right and this is the
cover you can see that and the author is
danielle claude and i'm not sure how to
say the last name and I'm kind of even
afraid to attempt it because i feel like
i'm just going to completely slaughter
it but i will leave the link to my
review on chocolate floss in the
description box and then also the amazon
link to it so you guys can find it
easily and this book i reviewed for CLP
blog tours and i was a little bit
nervous about picking it up because it's
actually part of a series and its book
five and i haven't read books 1 through
4 at all and so I was a little bit
nervous like would I be able to get into
this book would I be able to understand
it would I know what the characters are
doing type of thing but i do like
mystery so I thought I'll just give it a
shot and the beginning I will say I was
kind of like I have missed so much and I
want to know what happened over here and
I want to know what happened with this
character but as I kept reading it
really started not to matter anymore
because the book is so
fast pace it just like even when i would
get down with one chapter i was like
well i could prolly just keep reading
this one more chapter to see what
happens it's fast paced it's full of
action there's the mystery to it they're
suspense to it there's a lot of
questions is a really great friendship
that I enjoyed reading about as well and
then just like what i said with the
mysteries there's like not just one
mystery in the book there's several and
so but there's so much mystery in the
book and i really do recommend this I
gave it a 4 star it did make me want to
read the other books in the series so
maybe if you can check those out as well
and then this one I just from the one
that I've read I really enjoyed it and I
bet the series would be pretty good too
so that is stages and thieves and they
got four source from me the next one I
reviewed is one that I know so many
people are looking forward to reading
and are excited about and it is I regret
nothing by jen lancaster and jen is one
who when i first started chiclet plus i
think as bitter as the new black has one
of like one of the first books that I
really raved about on chiclet plus and I
was so excited for this new author and I
read all of Jen's books and I think they
are so cool and I was so excited to
receive a copy of I regret nothing
because i just i love Jen's riding and i
think it's very unique and I think her
books are just so much fun to read so I
was super super excited to get this one
and it probably shouldn't come as a
shock that I loved it I haven't written
my review yet but I'm sure that I'm
going to give it five stars because I
feel like once I start writing down all
of my thoughts and feelings on it like
I'm just going to get even more excited
but it is a memoir help and to get her
take from it and I also thought it was
it's more towards the end of the book
but she talks about her weight struggle
and what she did
did to lose weight and get healthier and
I found those parts really really
interesting and I found them really
inspiring which I just thought I thought
that was was awesome so like major kudos
to her because so much good stuff in
this book it's a lot about
self-improvement there's a lot of lot of
talk about self-improvement and her trip
to to Italy played a big part in that
too and she talked about while being in
Italy everyone is so like laid-back and
calm and they take so long at dinner
because like dinner is the main event
for so many of them and you know in the
u.s. we're always rushing and we're
multitasking and we're going here we're
going there and we're trying to impress
people and like she said in Italy there
was like no Home Depot's or like pure
ones or anything like that and she's
like Italians not try to impress each
other like Americans do and I thought
that was hilarious in very interesting
so I thought that this book was filled
with great material I think it if you
haven't read any from jen lancaster i
highly suggest you do she has several
books out and i think they're all
fantastic and this one just gets added
to the list and the next one that we are
reviewing is a perfect man and it's by
cecilia dominic and i'm still reading
this one so my review well my review
should be up by the time this video goes
up but I'm about fifty percent through
it though this is a perfect man and like
I said I'm about halfway through it
right now and i'm totally loving it i'm
getting through it so fast because kind
of like with stages and thieves I kind
of just don't want to put it down sure
that we follow is Karen and I find this
interesting from an author perspective
because she's taking a writing course
and first up I don't know if we'll get
other ones in the book to but so far the
first one there studying the romance
your honor
and she has a class i think it's like
five or six other students and they
learn how to write romance and then
there's are going to go through
different genres but right now the one
we're focusing on is romance and so
they're trying to write and there's like
tips along the way from the professor
and so as an author I'm having a
fantastic time reading lid if you are a
writer you would probably get a kick out
of this book especially if you're a
trial bands out there so I'm really
enjoying that but she gets teamed up
with another guy in her class and they
have to basically collaborate on a
romance book together and give the
female and the male perspectives which i
think is so cool I know that there's
whenever I see authors write books
either from a male perspective or they
have the male perspective in there I'm
just like you go because I feel like
that'd be so hard that's in the spoke to
because we also are getting the male
perspective in the book as well while
they're writing the book that make any
sense I said I don't think you just have
to be a writer to be able to enjoy it
because you can tell there's a cute
story going on I I kind of liked the
heroine a little bit the main character
because she can be kind of a b-word
sometimes and she I don't know for some
reason I'm not finding her to be like
the most likable character in the whole
wide world but as I'm like reading more
and more of it I'm starting to like warm
up to her more and more so that's always
nice it's you know you don't want a main
character who's like a total pushover
but you don't want main character who
you can't support it all and get behind
so it's nice to see them like go through
a journey type of thing and I think
that's what we're really getting with
Karen in a perfect man I haven't
finished all of it yet so I can't tell
you yet what I'm going to rate it
because I need to be able to finish it
to tell you that but by the time this
video runs I should have that up and the
final one that I want to talk about like
I mentioned it's a book that I did not
do the review for but I have actually
read the book and but the review ran
chocolate plus last week and I believe
it was a four-star review from Michelle
but I just kind of wanted to give it a
little mention just because I have read
it so I can kind of talk about it it's
called crazy little thing called
matchmaking and it's by megeve and well
it is the first in a series so book one
in a series and it takes place on Long
Island and it's a really super cute
romance book I think like it's not when
I say it's a romance book it's not like
heavy and passionate and blow a lot of
romance too and it's got the matchmaking
is involved but the matchmaking is from
the main characters to children so the
main character female wise is Kate and
she is a widow and she has two sons and
she works as a nurse and they get a new
doctor in her practice which is dr. Jake
Harris and he's much younger than Kate
but you can tell that there's the
attraction between them right away and
her sons who are both teenagers they
decide that they want to matchmake their
mom and dr. Harris who also lives in
their neighborhood I believe he moves
next door to them well they kind of come
together to put together a plan to get
their mom and this doctor together
because they really enjoy our new
neighbors you know he's finally man in
their lives after their dad has passed
away you know he's teaching him how to
play ball and all these sort of things
so the two boys start to try to slowly
like get them together and there's so
many funny scenes with that but you know
there's like that stubborn like no we're
not gonna be together or I don't think
she likes me I don't think he likes me
you know what obviously it takes a while
for them to decide what it is that
they're going to do but it's a book it
just it made me smile throughout reading
it
and I just thought it was such a fun
little read so i will put the link to
michelle's full review in the
description box so you can read what
Michelle thought about it but that was
just what i wanted to mention because
the review did run this week and i have
read it so i can actually talk to you
about it instead of just like reading
you the synopsis or something because no
one wants that to happen so those are
the four books that ran last week on
Chiclets plus and i really hope you
enjoyed them and i hope you can check a
few of them out because there were some
fun ones i want to say i am going to be
