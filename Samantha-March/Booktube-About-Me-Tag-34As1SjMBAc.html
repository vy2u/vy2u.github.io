thank you for stopping by today well I
have another tag video that I'm going to
do is the booktube about me tag so I
have one other tag to do with the
reading habits one and so I asked on
like social media what you guys wanted
to see and I'd say the majority said the
about me so that is what I'm going to do
today I'll do the reading habits
sometime in the near future but yeah if
you'd like to get to know a little bit
more about me please keep watching the
first question is what do you study or
what is your job so my job I am a
full-time author I say I'm full-time
books because I've not only an author I
have published four novels under the
name Samantha March that is not my real
name samantha is my real name but
Samantha March is the name I go by in
the book world also a publisher I own
the indie company marching ink if you
guys hear me talk about different titles
on this channel like release days for
them that's usually always for marching
ink books I also do freelance editing
proofreading I do marketing for authors
i run CLP blog tours which is a blog to
her company so I set up like different
marketing tours for authors i do more
marketing as well other than just the
blog tours I do like I work with a few
other publishing companies usually with
with marketing for them I do run
chocolate Plus which is what started all
of this it is my book Beauty lifestyle
blog we have book reviews on there we
talk about Fitness on their beauty tips
on there all sorts of things that's kind
of what started everything back in two
thousand nine was just starting that
little blog yeah so that's what I do
full time I wear a lot of different hats
but I absolutely love it I feel very
grateful that it is what I get to do and
I have done a full video kind of
explaining what i do because i know that
people can get confused or wonder or
athlete you know how i started or how i
do this or you know things like that so
i can put it in
up here but I can also link in the
description box below if you guys want
more like in-depth explanation as to
what the heck it is i do question is
what is your favorite social media
channel and I'm not sure I know what
this means is that YouTube channel or
like is there a certain plat form of
social media that I prefer i'm i'm sorry
i'm not exactly positive what that is
asking favorite social media platforms
right now are probably like YouTube and
Instagram I really love YouTube I'm I
mean that's basically like what I do all
day is watch YouTube my husband will
walk into my office and be like now that
video are you watching I'm like oh you
know just just hanging out of my office
watching YouTube videos and but I
absolutely love it before I started on
like doing videos for YouTube I was
watching YouTube videos all different
kinds of videos I love watching Beauty
videos book videos obviously because
that's what I do but I like to watch
fitness videos I'm always watching like
new ways to do yoga some of the yogi I
like to watch like organizational tips
like you know how to decorate your
office how to organize your closets
things like that so I really loved
youtube I also really enjoy Instagram
when it first came out I was like I
don't I don't understand what this is
but I feel like it's been that way with
every social media like when Twitter
came out I was like ain't nobody gonna
want to tweet but so I've really come to
love Instagram I do have a fitness page
on there with my best friend we are the
cheeky chicks we basically we just focus
on our Instagram we do have like
Facebook and Twitter but and we do post
on those but Instagram is like our main
thing that's how we connect with people
we really love it I've recently started
I finally got chocolate plus on
Instagram everyone not everyone but a
lot of people are like asking like what
where's your trick lip bless Instagram
page and I'm like oh should I get one of
those so I'm March books beauty on
Instagram and that's everything for
Chiclets plus have yoga on there my dog
off their beauty on their books on there
it's a lot of fun I like it number three
is if you had another channel what would
it be about that's kind of hard because
my channel is basically split into two
focuses I have the
looks in the beauty side of things and
sometimes people you know have asked me
like why I decided to do them together
basically the reason that I've decided
to do them together is because this is
my channel for chocolate Plus which
features books and beauty chicklet plus
from the start from you know my
brainchild was to have more than just a
book blog in more than just a beauty
blog I wanted to provide more because
some of my favorite websites to go to
are considered more lifestyle websites
where they feature more than just one
topic and that's what I want two
chocolate plus to be so that's why I
have it together like we have guest
bloggers on chocolate plus i talk about
fitness i've i've talked about fitness
there myself when I did jelly michaels
30 day shred I talked about fitness I
blogged my LASIK journey I got LASIK
surgery on my eyes Paula about four
years ago I blog that whole thing I just
like to talk to people about things that
I'm interested in and I'm interested in
more than books and I'm interested in
more than beauty so that's why I wanted
to do it like that so when I was
thinking about starting my channel I was
like why would I split it into two
different things that have like a
chiclet plus one and it shook plus two
like that wouldn't make any sense to me
so that's why I did it as one kind of an
explanation of why I did it that way but
if I were to have another channel what
would I talk about I don't know maybe
maybe like solely focused on fitness and
yoga with the cheeky chicks maybe that
but it's kind of hard we actually we
thought about it once like we tried
really hard to come up with its like
workout routines and things like that
but we were still very new at the time
but just like not really sure where we
were going or what we could do we were
new to yoga too so it's like we couldn't
really give a whole lot of tips and
advice yet we've been doing it for just
over a year now but maybe we'll think
about starting the YouTube open with you
guys maybe number four is do you play
any instruments no I don't at all ah I
played the violin in like elementary
school hated it I played it for a few
weeks made my mom like buy me an
expensive violin and like the bow and
then like all the accessories in the
case I was like I don't want to do this
my bed 45 is what hobbies do
have other than reading of course beauty
makeup all that good stuff I love it
fitness yes talked about it love working
out my other hobbies you know probably
just hang out with my friends and my dog
is that a hobby those are my hobbies
number six is what is my favorite TV
show I don't really watch TV you guys I
it's one thing if I really wish we would
cancel our cable because I don't watch
it and I sit at home all day but I have
no mmm to watch the TV like I don't know
what I would do the only reason why we
don't cancel it is because both my
husband and I love sports I love sports
I love football I love baseball I can't
not watch my games it sucks I just wish
I could have like cable only for sports
can that happen has that happened can
someone tell me if that will happen
because that's what i want but TV shows
sometimes i'll try to record things
especially for in the winter i like to i
still like to work out usually i would
take my workouts like outside walk with
the dog run you know we do you'll go
outside you look at the park etc but in
the winter I'm like no no no I'm not
going outside so I'll work out in the
living room sometimes I'll do DVD
sometimes I do my own thing but I like
to have something like some sort of
noise so in the winter a lot of times
I'll try to record shows on the DVR so I
can watch them I recorded the royals i
think that season just sewed it up again
i need to start watching that if i
recorded anything else that like
sometimes I'll watch like HD TV because
I like to like get little ideas of like
decorating and redoing things we're
currently in the process of finishing
our basement so I feel like am I giving
a few ideas but other than that I like
sports number seven is what got you into
reading and what got me into reading is
probably just like my mom and my grandma
they were big readers and that's what
they did and you know that they were two
women that I loved so much and looked up
to and wanted to be like them so I would
read to and you know we would take
little trips together we'd always go
library together like the library was
like my stuck at home when I was a child
and I don't know I guess that's what got
me into reading and then it just became
a huge passion of mine in a child it
helped me escape to another world
another place because I'm definitely a
reader that when i read a book I get you
know usually if it's a good book I can
get transported into other worlds and
some things from my childhood were kind
of rough and so by reading it kind of
helped me like escape into that world
and I could kind of forget about what
was going on in mine and it kind of
helped me mentally I would probably say
and a lot of the books that I read when
I was younger had a lot of good like
life lessons in there that I would learn
but then also it I feel like reading
helped keep me positive and helped keep
my outlook positive because I could have
gone down I could have gone down a very
wrong path and I really do credit
reading and the books that i read that
kept me on the right path that makes
sense mairead is what is your favorite
and least favorite genres my favorite
genres are definitely Chiclets women's
fiction romance romantic comedies
Chiclets mystery like books that kind of
tie in the past and the present i think
those are a lot of fun so those are
probably my favorites my least favorites
i don't know i don't i don't like horror
I don't like horror movies I don't like
anything horror I don't want to read
horror I get scared so not a huge horror
person are like sci-fi I'm really I'm
not very much into like sci-fi as well
so maybe those are my least favorite
number nine is what books define your
childhood and there's wondering if that
means like the books that like I always
read as a child but really I mean it's
the baby-sitters club those books like
when I talked about books that helped
keep me on the right path those are
definitely the baby-sitters club I mean
I truly credit and i'm martin and her
and her baby's hairs and her characters
for helping seriously like like helping
shape Who I am because those books I
thought were so good to read as a child
I started reading them at too young an
age because I actually found out one of
those bugs that the Tooth Fairy wasn't
real and I remember storming into my
mom's office or my mom's bedroom I mean
like what is this and she was so mad but
because i read at a like more advanced
level even when i was younger i was i
started reading baby-sitters club too
soon like I learned a few things in
there that I'd probably shouldn't have
and my mom was not very pleased but the
books were you know the word I want to
use this wholesome and they really were
and they just I read those books for
years and years and I collected so many
of them I should find them so I can
share them all with you I'd put him on
my bookshelf because even though I would
take up my entire bookshelf definitely
those books when I think about my
childhood and I think about what I read
and I think about all that good stuff I
mean I think about the baby-sitters club
number ten is tell us an interesting
fact about you and this is so hard but
you know what is so funny not that long
ago what was it like two weeks ago I was
with a few friends and we were like
telling funny facts about ourselves and
I legit told the one about finding out
to the Tooth Fairy wasn't real in a
baby-sitters club book and I already
just told you guys that so like can I
use that one again that was me why it's
like fresh in my mind because I just
just told someone that so yeah I can
that count can that count as my
interesting fact because I than that I
don't have anything off the top of my
head to get more like interesting facts
about myself written down so if these
ever pop up again somewhere I could be
like got one because right now i don't
think i have one the booktube about me
