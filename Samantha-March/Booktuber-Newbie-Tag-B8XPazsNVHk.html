a different kind of video it's one that
I found just going through other
booktubers YouTube pages and kind of
seeing what they have on there and I
found something called the book tuber
newbie tag and it's basically the same
set of questions that every like new
booktuber just answers and and does a
video for it a lot of people were doing
it as like our first video and for my
first video I just did like a random hi
this is who I am this would be a fun one
to do and since i'm still super new I
figured it would be okay to do I did
want to just kind of a throw something
out there because as I've been doing my
research on booktubers amok videos
they're doing what they're talking about
just kind of reading people's comments
and seeing what they have to say I
stumbled across something about like
there's some sort of animosity between
booktubers and book bloggers which is
very odd to me I am a book blogger
that's where I got my start and from
what I you know I have found other
booktubers that our book bloggers to or
who started a book blog after they
started their YouTube channel and things
like that so I'm really not sure I don't
like to focus on negativity so honestly
I saw it was just like I'm not even
really going to delve into it because I
don't want to read people's like nasty
comments that's just not how I prefer to
spend my days so I really didn't even
look into it I don't even know what it's
about maybe it's nothing I really have
no idea so far I've only been on YouTube
for a short time I feel pretty welcomed
a lot of the people who are commenting
and liking and subscribing are from my
book blogging world and I think that's
pretty cool that some new people are
finding other booktubers here on YouTube
and finding new people to subscribe to
and authors are getting a new outlet so
I think that we should all get a lot
and if we're talking about books that's
cool I know that I'm also a little
different because I'm going to be
talking about books and beauty and
probably fitness and not going to be
solely focused on books probably the
majority of this channel will be about
books but not all of it so hopefully
that doesn't cause any problems with
anybody else either but I wear a lot of
different hats I have a lot of different
interests so that's my brief little
intro that probably wasn't briefed at
all let's be serious but so let's just
jump into the actual part of this video
there's a few questions I don't even
know maybe like eight questions that I'm
going to answer hopefully not trying
like this as fast as I can but I just
thought this would be kind of a neat
video I have no idea I don't think
you're supposed to be like tagged by
someone in order to do this video
because i thought other people were like
i just saw this and thought it would be
fun to make so that's what I'm going
with let's do it why did you start this
channel is the first question and I
started a YouTube channel it literally
was just like a crazy idea i had one day
I it was a few weeks ago on a weekend I
was watching YouTube videos and a bunch
of book one started popping up and I
thought cool and I was going through
them and watching the videos and I
thought this could be really fun to do
why not and that's what happened it it
literally was like an idea that I
thought about for maybe two hours and I
was like let's put some makeup on and
click record on your camera and just see
what happens and that's what happened so
that's that's how it got started the why
I literally just thought it would be a
fun idea I thought it would be a new
outlet I thought it would be a new way
to meet people and I thought it would be
a new way to give authors connections to
readers and vice versa and that's my job
and that's what I do all day so why not
try to find new outlets what are some
fun and unique things that you can bring
to booktube and like I said I'm not
going to be solely book focused so
well if there is anyone else out there
who is a huge lover of books but also
wants to see like makeup reviews and
time we talk about fitness I mean if
there's anyone out there that likes that
that kind of has the same passions that
has me please let me know because
sometimes i just am off in my own little
bubble here not really knowing what
other people like but that's what i like
so that's what i like to talk about so
you'll get not only books for me but
you'll get other stuff and then also not
only am i a book blogger but I'm an
author and the publisher I do a lot of
marketing for books and have my fingers
in a lot of different areas of the book
industry and the publishing industry and
I would like to use this channel to talk
about that how I started writing and how
I started my career how I started a
publishing company some ways to market
books you know maybe authors will be
interested in what I have to say about
that i've been working in marketing for
several years now for books and and then
also as I've been looking around at
different booktubers I really don't see
a whole lot of Chiclets or even like
women's fiction romance kind of the
genres that I read and that I would be
talking more about I see a lot of why a
um a lot of why a which is which is
great I like to read why I to so but I
haven't seen a whole lot of booktubers
in my genre so maybe if you're out there
please let me know because I would love
to follow you so if you are please tell
me because i will subscribe right back
to you I have another thing maybe I can
get a new genre here on booktube so in
what are you most excited about for this
new channel that's probably just making
new connections I've already found
several other booktubers that I've been
talking to which i think is really cool
like I just keep meeting more people
when i started my book blog I now
consider like I have this huge yearbook
of virtual friends and sometimes I'm
even lucky enough to be able to meet
those
friends I've gone on trips to like
Canada and New York and I've been able
to meet other authors and book bloggers
and readers and I think that's so cool
so if I can just make more connections
and more friends that have the same
passions that I do and we can connect on
that level I think that's amazing why do
you love reading I mean how do you I
don't even know how you answer this
question how why I don't know I just do
it's just what I do I don't know I think
I've said this in a prior video but
you'll never ask me when I'm reading and
I say nothing because I'm always
breeding sometimes I'm reading several
books at once sometimes I'm reading a
book but I'm reading a manuscript for an
author I mean I'm always reading
something if I'm just like sitting
around I would rather be reading than
just like staring off into space are
playing games on my phone I don't even
have any games on my phone because I'd
rather be reading then eze love reading
I mean why else would i started with
blog I don't know what book or series
got you into reading that would probably
be the baby-sitters club I mean who
didn't love the baby-sitters club right
I have so when I was younger and in
school I was told that my reading level
I can't remember what great i was in
when i was told this but my reading
level was like grits higher than what
the normal reading level would be so i
started reading the paper sitters club
kind of at a young age the baby-sitters
club actually one of the books is where
i found out that the Tooth Fairy wasn't
real and I remember storming into my
mother's room and being like the tooth
fairy's not real mom it says it in this
book that the tooth fairy's not real and
she was so upset because I was reading
these books probably a little bit before
my time and that was finding out certain
things but thanks baby-sitters club you
read you take away my innocence that's
really I mean those books and how many
of those books were there not only were
the regular books but then they had all
those specials
they had the vacation specials and the
mystery specials I mean I loved at the
baby-sitters club I loved the movie I
still follow ana martin everywhere that
i can follow her and she's always
talking about the baby-sitters club and
if it's someone's birthday one of the
characters birthdays I get so excited so
the baby-sitters club most definitely
loved it what questions would you ask
your favorite booktuber I mean I
wouldn't try to like harass them with
all my questions on youtube like how do
you edit your videos what software do
you use because that's really annoying
no one wants me to ask them that I would
probably ask like where do you live like
are you close to Iowa at all a lot of
people I'm fighting to or in the UK or
Canada and I like I like Canada I've
been to Canada one of my virtual
Bessie's is lives in Canada hello to
Kaylee at books etc I'll link to her
blog below cuz I think she's fabulous
she's awesome she took me to Niagara
Falls she let me stay at her house one
time and we didn't event in Canada so I
probably just try to find out where they
live if there's under ever any like book
to her events that happened i would i
would love to know that like i said i
just looked i just like to make
connections and i like to meet those
people if that's ever possible and do
any sort of events with them so that
would probably be a big question I have
and yeah that'd probably be like my
biggest question how stalkerish is that
where do you live do you wanna come to
Iowa do you want me to come visit you I
mean that's really creepy that's creepy
okay I'll try to think of some better
questions to ask challenges do you think
starting a booktuber channel will be the
hardest to overcome well I mean my hair
today is like how often have I been
playing with my hair in this video I'm
sorry you guys it's really wild honestly
I mean I've talked about it a lot of my
videos before the editing and the
software I'm just trying to figure all
that out like it takes me hours upon
hours upon hours to edit in a video and
it's literally just like trimming the
beginning and trimming the end so you
don't see me like sitting and turning
my camera on and la vida and then I
finally just learned how to like cut
myself in little sections so when I'm
sitting here like you don't see all of
that I cannot cut myself and those are
literally the only things that I've
learned and it took me a while and it
takes me a long time to edit so I see
some of these booktuber videos and they
have all these like cool things
happening in the video and all these
noises and videos in videos and I'm like
how do you do that so that I mean
probably just the technical stuff and
the editing stuff is going to be the
hardest yeah that's probably what I
think it's going to be the hardest I
don't know if that really counts as like
a booktuber question but I know that's
going to be really hard for me to
overcome hope that works but those are
all the questions for the booktuber
newbie tag hopefully I answered them
okay and I do still want to do I
mentioned this in a prior video but I
still do want to do a Q&amp;amp;A and I'm still
writing down the questions that are
coming in but if you do have any
questions that you want to ask me
whether it's on the channel my book blog
my books my writing my personal life my
dog my anything at all please do comment
below or you can find me on like Twitter
and just send me a tweet and I'm just
like screen dropping them on my phone so
i'll have them when i want to do that
video but I just kind of wanted to do a
little more like in-depth about me and
what I do Q&amp;amp;A just so you guys can kind
of get to know me a little bit better so
again please do comment below if you
have any questions or like the video if
this video if you want to see me do the
Q&amp;amp;A maybe you guys don't like q and A's
I don't you know I don't know I'm new so
you guys just tell me what you want to
see and I will be doing that for you and
I think that's all I have so until next
time thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
