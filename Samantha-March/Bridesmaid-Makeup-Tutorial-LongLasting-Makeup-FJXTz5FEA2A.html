today's video I am super excited about
it because it is going to be a
bridesmaid makeup tutorial video so it
can be used if you're in a wedding
coming up and you just need a bit of a
glamorous look I've even seen some
graduation tutorials going up a little
bit more on the glam side it's just kind
of like a soft glam look like not super
in your face Kapow but just a little bit
more glamorous and I think perfect for a
bridesmaid this is definitely look I
would do if I am going to be a
bridesmaid coming up I'm also really
excited because I'm partnering with
Scandinavia for this video Scandinavia
sent me two of their sprays they look
like this one is the makeup primer spray
and then one is the makeup finishing
spray and i have seen skin and Naevia
products I'll vlog on youtube and I've
been super super curious about them I'm
so excited to be able to try these
products and thank you to skin and
Naevia for sending them to me and for
working with me on this video like I'm
just super super excited can you tell
should we play a game like how many
times I can say excited it was gonna be
a lot so I have been using both of these
products for about two weeks now pretty
steadily because I want it to be able to
kind of give a review as well and just
to be able to make sure that I know what
I'm talking about I can get my feedback
and I am so impressed with them so to
first talk about the makeup primer spray
so this is obviously what you would put
on to prime your face and it is oil free
and it is paraben free and basically you
just need to like make sure you shake it
well because it actually like activates
the product and then you spray it on
your face it helps prime your face and
then from the back it says it's an anti
shine vitamin based primer it absorbs
excess oil while creating a smooth
lightweight canvas for flawless makeup
application it helps to even out skin
tone reduce the appearance of large
pores and prevents breakouts and it is
silicone free which is really well
because then you know that it's not
going to clog your pores because I can
kind of have a little bit of issues with
that like everyone smile i get like
weird large pores right here it sad i
don't want to talk about it let's move
on I thought it was interesting because
while I was reading this it does say
it's formulated for
to skin which I have sensitive skin
cells like thank you very much it's also
oil-free and cruelty-free which is
excellent of course what I really really
like about this primer is that it just
makes your skin look so nice even before
you put makeup on like there is a
noticeable difference when you spray
this on your face even before you put
makeup on it just makes your skin look
almost like healthier I feel like it
makes it look a little bit smoother and
I just I'm impressed with the results
like even if I'm gonna go run errands
and I don't have time to do makeup I'm
finding myself just spraying this on my
face so I'm like I just feel like it
gives me like a little bit of an oomph
like maybe a little bit more confidence
but I'm gonna go see people with no
makeup on my face I'll spray this and
I've really been enjoying the results of
it and then for the makeup finishing
spray so for the makeup finishing spray
it says it's specifically designed to
resist the effects of excess moisture
and our Bridal miss helps keep makeup
looking flawless and photo ready it
absorbs quickly and last for up to 16
hours and is for all skin types so it
does say where's that it says Bridal
right here because it's kind of like
specifically formulated for bridal looks
which is why I thought it'd be really
cool to create a bridesmaid tutorial
with this makeup and because when you're
working with bridesmaids brides
graduation day like I mentioned or just
anything where you know that you're
going to need your makeup to last all
day maybe you're going to be out in like
the sunshine and warmer conditions you
need your makeup to stay on and stay
looking good the primers and the other
makeups that I use that I will be
talking about the tutorial these are
like the key things that are going to
keep your makeup on and keep your makeup
looking good so having an excellent
primer to be able to help you out with
that is always very important as doing a
little bit of research on Scandinavia as
well and just watching other videos and
watching other people who use them what
they have to say about them how they use
them you know that sort of thing
counselling life's I know is a big fan
of Scandinavia she mentioned this in her
like bulletproof makeup tutorial she's
mentioned it in her favorite setting
sprays I also found out that you know
how everyone loves the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray I don't have it
myself but I guess Scandinavia is the
company that actually makes the Urban
Decay setting spray hopefully I'm saying
that correctly but I've seen that in
several videos I've looked
the like the ingredients in both of them
and they both have the same 17
ingredients in there and it just that's
really cool because I mean I urban decay
is just like raved about and basically
you're getting something a super duper
duper similar in these sprays also
Scandinavia does have a coupon code if
you do want to try these out this is not
an affiliate code but it's just a coupon
code for if you do want to try it you
can get fifteen percent off your order
also get two free like pocket sized
sprays and then also free shipping in
the US the code i believe is set 15 i
will put it in here and use it below and
you also will need to follow the link
that is below and then use the code set
15 and you'll get the fifteen percent
off the two free products and the free
shipping which is pretty awesome that is
not an affiliate link so I'm not like
making money off that just so you guys
are aware it's just for if you do want
to try it scandinavia is offering that
code but if you're in the market for a
good setting spray or if you're a makeup
artist a lot of the videos that i've
watched that our makeup artists that
have kids they really really recommend
these especially if you do a lot of
bridle on people i feel like this would
be really really amazing for your
collection I'm excited that I got these
like right in time for summer because
there's so many events where we leave
the house at 10 11 noon and we're not
coming home until well in tonight and
you just want your makeup looking key
I'm really excited to bring this
bridesmaid tutorial for you guys
actually last year when i first started
YouTube a bridesmaid tutorial was one of
the very first videos ever requested by
a subscriber and I never got around to
doing it because I didn't have like a
filming schedule yet I really wasn't
doing tutorials at the time yet because
I didn't even like I was still filming
off my phone I really didn't know what I
was doing yet so I just never got around
to it and then by the time that I felt
confident to do on you know I was like
dead of winter and bridesmaids aren't
totally common at that time of the year
but now that we're getting into summer
and wedding season is coming up I
thought it would be the perfect time to
do I brides my tutorial so I hope you
guys are excited for this video get your
bridesmaid look on get your graduation
look on just get your long lasting
makeup look on so without further ado
let's put some makeup on alright gay so
starting our first of course with the
skin
via makeup primer spray giving it a good
shake spraying that over my face and
letting it soak in do its wonders do a
little dance mmm so for the foundation
I'm going to use the Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless foundation I'm going
to pour some of that directly on to my
Real Techniques makeup sponge and this
is damp then I'm going to pants that
into my skin the reason why I chose this
foundation is because if you're going to
an event or you know you're going to be
a lot be around a lot of flash
photography you don't want to use
anything that has SPF in it and this
foundation does not so you won't have to
worry about getting that creepy white
cast with a flash photography I also
really like this foundation because it
is full coverage and it does not budge
throughout the day so you'll also see me
bring it down onto my neck just so we
can make sure we are totally matched
seal area i'm gonna use the Maybelline
fit me concealer I'm going to place this
on my under eyes also my forehead down
the bridge of my nose Cupid's bow and
chin for bigger events I go a little bit
harder on the concealer so we not only
conceal like you see here I'm covering
up some redness around my mouth but you
also are using it to brighten and
highlight and when you do that under the
eyes you also want to do that for the
center of the face to give you a balance
to look I do kind of go into more detail
in this with my full coverage foundation
routine because I also cover contour
highlight and baking so you can check
that out if you would like I'm going to
also put the concealer on my eyelids and
have it act as my eye primer and then
once again I just take it the Real
Techniques makeup sponge and buff
everything into the skin
and then to set the foundation i'm going
to use the Maybelline loose powder I've
talked about this a lot I think it was
just in my last favorites video and then
I used the more feet III and I lost the
clip of this but I just apply that all
over my face to set my foundation and
then to set the concealer i use the wet
and wild belle je de leche contouring
palette and my ELF small tapered brush
and I put the setting powder on the
areas where I applied my concealer to
make sure it stays in does not crease
anywhere and then to start with the eyes
i'm going to be using shadows from
Anastasia Beverly Hills the first one is
birkin and i'm going to pick that up
with my sigma e25 blending brush and I'm
going to apply this into the crease and
then not be very precise just kind of
smudge it around anywhere for this look
since it is for bridesmaid I wanted to
make it very simple and very easy
because when you're a bridesmaid you
never really know what kind of duties
are going to be handed to you the
morning of the wedding or how long you
will actually have to get ready so I
don't want to make a super complicated
look just because you never know what
that Brides going to need because
whatever she needs you guys to go do it
that's your job so just applying working
all over the eyes and then I'm going to
spray my morphe g13 brush with a little
bit of mac fix+ and then i am picking up
pink champagne also from anastasia
beverly hills and i'm just going to Pat
this onto the eyelid pink champagne from
Anastasia is such like a beloved I
shadow and for a good reason it's
absolutely gorgeous especially when
you're going for more of a clam look
like this is just the most perfect a
shadow it is so pretty and then outdrive
place that I'm just going to use my
Sigma e25 and blend everything together
no extra product on the brush just
blending and then for eyeliner I'm going
to use from unique it's their liquid
eyeliner pen and it's in proper which is
brown and I prefer brown when I'm going
for more of a softer look because it's
just a little less harsh than Black is
and it also really
like this pen because I feel like it's
very beginner friendly and user friendly
and even though we are going to put
false lashes on so I'm not concentrating
too much on making the wing you know you
also want your liner to look good at the
same time and this is just really easy
to apply like I would never use the NYC
liquid liner on an important event like
this or you really only have one shot to
get your makeup right because its just
oh that one's too hard when it's bad
it's really bad so this is a really good
option I also do like the Maybelline
master precise eyeliner but I have mine
in black and I wanted to use a brown
liner so that's why I went with unique
and then I'm going to take the
Maybelline master skinny gel pencil also
in brown and put that on my waterline
and then I'm going to take some of the
Anastasio broken again on my morphe e36
and just buff that into the lower lash
line and then for mascara I'm going to
use the Smashbox x-rated mascara this
was just mentioned in my previous
favorites video I believe and I'm going
to apply that to my lower lashes and
then I'm also going to prep my tab
lashes for false eyelashes so I'm going
to apply that on top lashes as well and
for my eyelashes i'm using the ardell
wispies i think they are gorgeous
they're still glamorous but they aren't
like too over the top or crazy because
you know we don't need all the attention
focus on us we just the bridesmaids so
for contour bronzer i'm using the
wet'n'wild at the contouring palette
again in the contour shade and my morphe
m530 brush line this on the cheek bones
and also the temple near my hairline and
underneath my jaw as well
for blush I'm going to use Dulce pink i
believe it is from Milani and my morphe
for brush i did also just do a top 10
makeup brushes video and this eve or is
mentioned in there it is my favorite
bullish brush of life I love it so far
highlight i'm going to use from becca
cosmetics and jaclyn hill champagne pop
and use my morphe m5a1 brush to apply
that to my cheekbones also above my
eyebrow to give a bit of a lifted look
then i'm also gonna place it down my
nose and on my Cupid's bow I just love
champagne pop it's one of my favorite
highlighters I feel like the name is
just you know it's like wedding e
champagne weddings you know for lips I'm
going to come in with kandi kay from
Kylie cosmetics i'm going to use both
the lip liner to line and then fill in
my lips and then also the liquid
lipstick which is just such a pretty
natural pink color so it's still going
to make your lips look really pretty but
you're not being too bold if which i
think is important as a bridesmaid but I
also chose Kylie cosmetics because I
feel like it is just such a good formula
and it stays on for hours and hours and
hours without needing any retouching it
just it just stays on and so that's what
you want of course when it comes to a
wedding then to finish the look off I'm
going to spray my face once again with
this in Navia make up finishing spray
for 16 hours of long-lasting where
you're going to be sweat proof you're
going to be to your proof it's going to
be all good what this primer and after
we have sprayed that shake it up shake
it up spray it and then in this look at
the finished look I really hope that you
enjoyed this tutorial for a bridesmaid
look or maybe a glam graduation day you
can even do this as a bright a look
honestly I can't even remember what my
makeup was on my wedding day nope I
don't remember I'd have to look at
pictures to see what I looked like as a
bride the whole day of getting buried is
just like the most overwhelming thing
ever so I truly can't remember why to my
Bridal makeup
look like but if you like a soft glam
look this could be it for you I will
leave all of the products that I use
