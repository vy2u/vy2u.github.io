today's video I am super excited about
it because it is going to be a
bridesmaid makeup tutorial video so it
can be used if you're in a wedding
coming up and you just need a bit of a
glamorous look I've even seen some
graduation tutorials going up a little
bit more on the glam side it's just kind
of like a soft glam look like not super
in-your-face Kapow but just a little bit
more glamorous and I think perfect for a
bridesmaid this is definitely a look I
would do if I am going to be a
bridesmaid coming up I'm also really
excited because I'm partnering with
Scandinavia for this video Scandinavia
sent me two of their sprays they look
like this one is the makeup primer spray
and then one is the makeup finishing
spray and I have seen skin and navy are
products I'll log on YouTube and I've
been super super curious about them I'm
so excited to be able to try these
products and thank you to skin and Avia
for sending them to me and for working
with me on this video like I'm just
super super excited
can you tell should we play a game like
how many times I can say excited it was
gonna be a lot so I have been using both
of these products for about two weeks
now pretty steadily because I want it to
be able to kind of give a review as well
and just to be able to make sure that I
know what I'm talking about and I can
get my feedback and I am so impressed
with them so to first talk about the
makeup primer spray so this is obviously
what you would put on to prime your face
and it is oil free and it is paraben
free and basically you just need to like
make sure you shake it well because it
actually like activates the product and
then you spray it on your face and it
helps prime your face and then from the
back it says it's an anti shine vitamin
based primer it absorbs excess oil while
creating a smooth lightweight canvas for
flawless makeup application it helps to
even out skin tone reduce the appearance
of large pores and prevents breakouts
and it is silicone free which is really
well because then you know that it's not
gonna clog your pores because I can kind
of have a little bit of issues with that
like everyone smile I get like weird
large pores right here it sad I don't
want to talk about it let's move on I
thought it was interesting because while
I was reading this it does say it's
formulated for
to skin which I have sensitive skin so I
was like thank you very much it's also
oil-free and cruelty-free which is
excellent of course what I really really
like about this primer is that it just
makes your skin look so nice even before
you put makeup on like there is a
noticeable difference when you spray
this on your face even before you put
makeup on it just makes your skin look
almost like healthier I feel like it
makes it look a little bit smoother and
I just I'm impressed with the results
like even if I'm gonna go run errands
and I don't have time to do makeup I'm
finding myself just spraying this on my
face cuz I'm like I just feel like it
gives me like a little bit of an oomph
like maybe a little bit more confidence
that I'm gonna go see people with no
makeup on my face I'll spray this and
I've really been enjoying the results of
it and then for the makeup finishing
spray so for the makeup finishing spray
it says it's specifically designed to
resist the effects of excess moisture
and our bridal mists helps keep makeup
looking flawless and photo ready it
absorbs quickly and lasts for up to 16
hours and it's for all skin types so it
does say where's that it says Bridal
right here because it's kind of like
specifically formulated for Bridal looks
which is why I thought it'd be really
cool to create a bridesmaid tutorial
with this makeup and because when you're
working with bridesmaids Brides
graduation day like I mentioned or just
anything where you know that you're
gonna need your makeup to last all day
maybe you're gonna be out and like the
sunshine and warmer conditions you need
your makeup to stay on and stay looking
good the primers and the other makeups
that I use that I will be talking about
the tutorial these are like the key
things that are going to keep your
makeup on and keep your makeup looking
good
so having an excellent primer to be able
to help you out with that is always very
important doing a little bit of research
on Scandinavia as well and just watching
other videos and watching other people
who use them what they have to say about
them how they use them you know that
sort of thing Kathleen lifes I know as a
big fan of Scandinavia she mentioned
this in her like bulletproof makeup
tutorial she's mentioned it in her
favorite setting sprays I also found out
that you know how everyone loves the
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray I
don't have it myself but I guess
Scandinavia is the company that actually
makes the Urban Decay setting spray
hopefully I'm saying that correctly but
I've seen that in several videos I've
looked
the like the ingredients in both of them
and they both have the same 17
ingredients in there and it just that's
really cool because I mean our urban
decay is just like raved about and
basically you're giving something a
super duper duper similar in these
sprays I'll tell Scandinavia does have a
coupon code if you do want to try these
out this is not an affiliate code but
it's just a coupon code for if you do
want to try it you can get 15% off your
order also get two free like
pocket-sized sprays and then also free
shipping in the US the code I believe is
set to 15 I open it in here and use it
below and you also will need to follow
the link that is below and then use the
code set 15 and you'll get the 15
percent off the two free products and
the free shipping which is pretty
awesome
that is not an affiliate link so I'm not
like making money off that just so you
guys are aware it's just for if you do
want to try it
Scandinavia is offering that code but if
you're in the market for a good setting
spray or if you're a makeup artist a lot
of the videos that I've watched that are
makeup artists that have kits they
really really recommend these especially
if you do a lot of Bridal on people I
feel like this would be really really
amazing for your collection I'm excited
that I got these like right in time for
summer because there's so many events
where we leave the house at 10 11 noon
and we're not coming home until well in
tonight and you just want your makeup
looking key I'm really excited to bring
this bridesmaid tutorial for you guys
actually last year when I first started
youtube a bridesmaid tutorial was one of
the very first videos ever requested by
a subscriber and I never got around to
doing it because I didn't have like a
filming schedule yet I really wasn't
doing tutorials at the time yet because
I didn't even like I was still filming
off my phone I really didn't know what I
was doing yet so I just never got around
to it and then by the time that I felt
confident to do on you know it's like
dead of winter and bridesmaids aren't uh
totally common at that time of the year
but now that we're getting into summer
and wedding season is coming up I
thought it would be the perfect time to
do it I brides my tutorial so I hope you
guys are excited for this video get your
bridesmaid look on get your graduation
look on just get your long-lasting
makeup look on so without further ado
let's listen makeup on alright guys so
starting off first of course with the
Scandinavia makeup primers
giving it a good shake spraying that
over my face and letting it soak in do
its wonders do a little dance mm-hmm so
for the foundation I'm going to use the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
foundation I'm going to pour some of
that directly on to my Real Techniques
makeup sponge and this is damp then I'm
going to bounce that into my skin the
reason why I chose this foundation is
because if you're going to an event or
you know you're gonna be a lot be around
a lot of flash photography you don't
want to use anything that has SPF in it
and this foundation does not so you
won't have to worry about getting that
creepy white cast will hit the flash
photography I also really like this
foundation because it is full coverage
and it does not budge throughout the day
so you'll also see me bring it down onto
my neck just so we can make sure we are
totally matched seal or how to use the
Maybelline fit me concealer I'm gonna
place this on my under eyes also my
forehead down the bridge of my nose
Cupid's bow and chin for bigger events I
go a little bit harder on the concealer
so we not only conceal like you see here
I'm covering up some redness around my
mouth but you also are using it to
brighten and highlight and when you do
that under the eyes you also want to do
that for the center of the face to give
you a balanced look I do kind of go into
more detail in this with my full
coverage foundation routine because I
also cover contour highlight and baking
so you can check that out if you would
like but I also put the concealer on my
eyelids and have it act as my eye primer
and then once again I just take it the
Real Techniques makeup sponge and buff
everything into the skin
and then to set the foundation I'm going
to use the Maybelline loose powder I've
talked about this a lot I think it was
just in my last favorites video and then
I used the morphe three and I lost the
clip of this but I just apply that all
over my face to set my foundation and
then to set the concealer I use the wet
and wild dulce de leche contouring
palette and my ELF smile tapered brush
and I put the setting powder on the
areas where I applied my concealer to
make sure it stays and does not crease
anywhere and then to start with the eyes
I'm going to be using shadows from
Anastasia Beverly Hills
the first one is Birkin and I'm going to
pick that up with my Sigma e25 blending
brush and I'm gonna apply this into the
crease and then not be very precise just
kind of smudge it around anywhere for
this look since it is for bridesmaid I
wanted to make it very simple and very
easy because when you're a bridesmaid
you never really know what kind of
duties are gonna be handed to you the
morning of the wedding or how long you
will actually have to get ready so I
don't want to make a super complicated
look just because you never know what
that Brides gonna need because whatever
she needs you guys to go do it that's
your job
so just applying working all over the
eyes and then I'm going to spray my
morphe g13 brush with a little bit of
mac fix+
and then i am picking up pink champagne
also from Anastasia Beverly Hills and
I'm just going to Pat this onto the
eyelid pink champagne from Anastasia is
such like a beloved eyeshadow and for a
good reason it's absolutely gorgeous
especially when you're going for more of
a glam look like this is just the most
perfect a shadow it is so pretty and
then outdrive place that I'm just going
to use my Sigma e25 and blend everything
together
no extra product on the brush just
blending and then for eyeliner I'm going
to use from unique it's their liquid
eyeliner pen and it's in proper which is
brown and I prefer Brown when I'm going
for more of a softer look because it's
just a little less harsh than black is
but I also really like this
because I feel like it's very beginner
friendly and user friendly and even
though we are gonna put false lashes on
so I'm not concentrating too much on
making the wing you know you also want
your liner to look good at the same time
and this is just really easy to apply
like I would never use that I know I see
a liquid liner on an important event
like this or you really only have one
shot to get your makeup right because
it's just oh that one's too hard when
it's bad it's really bad so this is a
really good option I also do like the
Maybelline master precise eyeliner but I
have mine in black and I wanted to use a
brown liner so that's why I went with
unique and then I'm gonna take the
Maybelline master skinny gel pencil also
in brown and put that on my waterline
and then I'm gonna take some of the
Anastasio Birkin again on my morphe 36
and just buff that into the lower lash
line
and then for mascara I'm gonna use the
Smashbox x-rated mascara this was just
mentioned in my previous favourites
video I believe and I'm gonna apply that
to my lower lashes and then I'm also
gonna prep my top lashes for false
eyelashes assuming apply that's on top
lashes as well and for my eyelashes i'm
using the Ardell whispies i think they
are gorgeous they're still glamorous but
they aren't like too over-the-top or
crazy because you know we don't need all
these hinge focus on us we just the
bridesmaids
so for contour bronzer I'm using the wet
and wild at the contouring palette again
in the contour shade and my morphe and
five-30 brush lighten this on the
cheekbones and also the temple near my
hairline and underneath my jaw as well
for blush I'm gonna use Dulce pink I
believe it is from Milani and my morphe
floor brush I did also just do a top 10
makeup brushes video and this efore is
mentioned in there it is my favorite
blush brush of life I love it so far
highlight I'm going to use from Becca
cosmetics and Jaclyn hill champagne pop
and use my morphe m5a1 brush to apply
that to my cheekbones also above my
eyebrow to give a bit of a lifted look
and then I'm also gonna place it down my
nose and on my Cupid's bow I just love
champagne pop it's one of my favorite
highlighters I feel like the name is
just you know it's like wedding
champagne weddings you know for lips I'm
going to come in with Kandy K from Kylie
cosmetics I'm going to use both the lip
liner to line and then fill in my lips
and then also the liquid lipstick which
is just such a pretty natural pink color
so it's still gonna make your lips look
really pretty but you're not being too
bold it which i think is important as a
bridesmaid but I also chose Kylie
cosmetics because I feel like it is just
such a good formula and it stays on for
hours and hours in hours without needing
any retouching it just it just stays on
and so that's what you want of course
when it comes to a wedding then to
finish the look off I'm going to spray
my face once again what this can Navia
makeup finishing spray for 16 hours of
long-lasting wear you're going to be
sweat proof you're gonna be tear proof
it's going to be all good what this
primer and after we have sprayed that we
shake it up shake it up spray it and
then look at the information look I
really hope that you enjoyed this
tutorial for a bridesmaid look or maybe
a glam graduation day you can even do
this as a bride a look honestly I can't
even remember what my makeup was on my
wedding day
nope I don't remember I'd have to look
at pictures to see what I looked like as
a bride the whole day of getting buried
is just like the most overwhelming thing
ever so I truly can't remember why to my
Bridal makeup look like but if you like
soft glam look this could be it for you
I will leave all of the products that I
used linked in the description box below
