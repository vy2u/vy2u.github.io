today's video is going to be another of
the spin on the YouTube maybe by it
videos this one is going to be Carli
bybel made me buy it so I recently did a
Jaclyn hill made me buy it video and it
went over really well and seemed like
people like that type of video and
suggested that I do another youtuber so
I decided to pick another one and go
with it
I'll leave my video that I did for the
Jaclyn hill made me buy it down below
and then I decided to do the next one
and have it be Carly because Carly was
actually the first beauty blogger that I
ever watched ever she was the very first
one the gal who did my wedding makeup
when she was like doing at the practice
run on me I was talking about watching
this Carly on YouTube and watching her
makeup tutorials and I was like what do
you mean people do makeup on YouTube
like that's weird I haven't heard of
that and I really had not heard of that
before
and she just talked so highly about her
that I was like okay I need to go check
this out and voila like that's what
started my obsession with watching
YouTube makeup videos and eventually
what made me decide to get started on
YouTube myself so I really wanted to do
a Carly one as well so basically I'm
just gonna go through a some like makeup
and beauty and even clothing products
that Carly really loved on and raved and
recommended and encouraged to buy and
that I went out and bought them so
without further ado why don't we go up
into what Carly made me buy okay so I
actually have a few items that I don't
have physically any more but Carly
definitely encouraged me to buy these so
one is the L'Oreal telescopic mascara
she when I first heard watching her
videos I felt like that was the only
mascara she was wearing and I was like I
need to go get that mascara I got the
mascara I loved it but unfortunately it
did something crazy to my eyes I have
very sensitive eyes there is certain
mascaras I can't wear theirs eyeliners I
can't wear I have a NYX glitter eyeliner
that I love so much I can't wear it it
irritates my eyes I have yet to sit down
and figure out what the exact to agree
that makes my eyes irritated so bad but
unfortunately the L'Oreal telescopic was
one that irritated my eyes so I had to
get rid of mine which I was so bummed
because it was beautiful like even after
I kind of figured out like hey I think
it's mascara that's irritating my eyes I
was like no no it's not no it's not no
it's not but it was so that was very sad
and then another one that I don't have
on hand but she definitely recommended
that I buy is the Kat Von D a trooper
eyeliner she was one that she was using
it was like a couple tutorials in a row
or something she just kept using that
eyeliner and I was like I need that
eyeliner and not only that but she
talked about Kat Von D a lot in general
the shade + light eye palette the shade
unlike contour palette even like
lipsticks from Kat Von D and so when she
started mentioning this trooper eyeliner
I'm a big fan of eyeliner so I went out
and bought it and I I went through it
I've already used to dub it was
fantastic I definitely need another one
but that is one that I really enjoyed as
well but definitely encouraged me to buy
them I just don't have them on hand
anymore
and this next thing some I still have
products that I want to mention and some
I don't have from the line anymore but
when I first started watching Carly's
videos she talked about BH Cosmetics a
lot she mentioned a lot of BH Cosmetics
from brushes to palettes like she was
just a big fan of BH Cosmetics
she has since gone on to collaborate and
make her own palette with BH Cosmetics
which I'll talk about later but she was
just a really big fan of BH and she
talked about how it was good for
beginners and when I first started
watching YouTube I was a complete makeup
newbie I never was able to get a handle
on makeup and I was always something
that was really frustrating so once my
world was opened up to hey people like
teach you step by step on YouTube I was
like sold I'm going to learn how to do
makeups and I'm slowly but surely
getting there slowly but surely BH
Cosmetics was one of the first makeup
purchases that I ever did and that was
definitely based on Carly's
recommendations I got a ton of eyeshadow
palettes like a ton of eyeshadow
palettes but I also purchased a lot of
brushes about maybe a year ago or so I
did a it's makeup decluttering and I'll
try to find it so I can link it down
below but it was a while ago and I
decluttered most of my BH palettes
mostly because they
were older one or there was two
different ph palettes that i dropped and
they were completely shattered and
broken one I think I sent to my niece
things like that so I don't have those
in my possessions anymore but I bought a
ton of brushes I just grabbed I grabbed
a solid four here but I bought a ton a
ton of BH brushes because when I was
first starting out in makeup I didn't
really want to spend a lot of money
because I was like I don't know what I'm
doing like I need to practice I don't
want to go out and spend you know $25 on
a single brush when I can pay $20 and
get a whole set from BH Cosmetics I'm
still a fan of BH Cosmetics to this day
I'm definitely a fan of their brushes I
talk about them a lot brush sets are
fantastic I love the cases they come
with I use them to travel all the time
and I'm still constantly reaching for my
BH brushes so thank you for that
recommendation okay and then moving on
the next one that I want to talk about
is from Mac and it is the vanilla
pigment home and she used this in so
many tutorials and I was like I just I
absolutely have to have this I've never
owned a pigment before but I was like
doesn't matter doesn't matter that I
don't know how to use this I'm going to
get it and whenever she would use her
Mac pigment she would obviously use the
mac fix+
as well and I was like okay so I got to
get both these were my very first two
Mac purchases ever I had no idea what I
was doing I didn't even know if we had a
Mac where I live I had to look it up I
was like it doesn't matter like she uses
these all the time I clearly need it and
you know obviously she would use this to
spray her face as well not just to use
with the pigment but I was like I got to
have it I looked it up I found it was in
one of our balls and I was like I am
going there so I know that she doesn't
use Mac anymore because it's not cruelty
free and she has since gone cruelty free
but I still didn't want to mention these
because I definitely purchased them
because of Carly another spray that she
talked about was the rose water spray
from Mario Badescu so this is their
facial spray with aloe herbs and rose
water I think everyone just calls it the
rose water spray from Mario Badescu but
she was I believe the very first one
that I saw talking about this and then
kind of everybody was getting into it
everybody bought it I purchased mine at
Ulta it is actually relatively
inexpensive I'll leave it linked down
below but I also got it during one of
feed like Ulta I think it was there 21
days of beauty so I got it for even
cheaper I used it to spray my face
before I did my makeup today and I
really liked this like in the summer I
always took it with me and I've just
sprayed my face every once in a while
it's just really hydrating I don't know
if it really does much more than that
but it feels nice on the skin gives you
a little boost you know but this was
definitely a recommendation from Carly
as well so I think Carly was the very
first person to kind of put first date
beauty on my radar she mentioned this
product in a I think I was like like
all-time summer must-haves type of video
and then she also mentioned again in a
favorites video and when people like
reapeat products either using it in
makeup tutorials or men turning it in
different favorites videos when they
start to repeat I'm like okay I need to
pay attention to that and I know that
she mentioned this product twice and so
first day beauty was already like on my
radar should I get something but what
she was talking about was the ultra
Repair Cream and I ended up when I first
purchased from first day Beauty I
purchased a set if you're new to my
channel I'm obsessed with sets that's
just what I like to do especially when
I'm trying new brands I prefer to get a
set and try a bunch of different things
so when I did buy this it did come in a
set but I'm almost out I don't know if
you'd be able to see it's white in there
I am almost out I'm starting to like get
to the bottom when I dig my fingernail
on there and I'm very sad about that
I love this stuff it is bomb I have gone
on to love first day Beauty I was
obsessed with the first kit that I
bought from them I came with a full-size
of this that came with facial radiance
pads that candidly cleanser came with so
many different things and now I've gone
on to be like really absolutely obsessed
with first day beauty I love them but
the ultra Repair Cream is what I use
nearly every single day all over my body
especially like when I get out of the
shower I just slather it all over me
and I don't care I love this stuff so
these next two products I want to talk
about are definitely like kicking it
old-school so like I said Carly was the
very first beauty blogger at that I ever
and kind of got me into YouTube and she
was one who is still to this day I just
find Carly to be extremely glamorous
like she's so glamorous and she's so
beautiful and so when she was going
through these tutorials and she was
mentioning products and recommending
them
I just learned I had a list and I was
just writing everything down because I
was like I want to look like you two she
is just so stunning but it it meant that
I was purchasing products that I maybe
didn't even know what I was doing and
the first one I have some stories to go
along with it I'm sorry I'll try and get
through these videos as fast as I can
have gotten a couple comments lately
like people don't want to hear your
stories they just want to see the
products and I'm like that's not why I
watch YouTube like just for products I
also like to get to know people and you
get to know people by hearing their
stories so I'm still gonna include my
stories you guys can let me know what
you think about that but that's what I
like for YouTube and it's my channel so
I get to do what I want to do and I'm
gonna do what I like to watch you know
what I'm saying
but one product that she recommended was
these Revlon Photoready skin lights so
when she was doing her tutorial or
recommending them she had two that she
mentioned one was pink light which I
have right here and the other one I
can't think of what it's name was I want
to say it has like rose in it or
something like that but I can't remember
when I decluttered I got rid of one
because I very rarely used these and I
really didn't need to buy two but in her
video she mentions both of them so when
I went to Walgreens I was like I need
both of them obviously but the problem
was is that I bought these and then I
couldn't exactly remember what she used
them for but I bought them right before
a trip to New York City I have book
signing in New York City if you're also
new to my channel I'm an author those
what I do full-time so I had a book
signing in New York City I'm so excited
about it me and my husband were going
for like four days to New York and a
couple of those days we're gonna be
spent at book events and then assigning
as well super excited I bought these
right before I left for the trip and
then I get to New York and I'm like crap
what does she use these for again I
cannot remember and so it was so
embarrassing
but I put them underneath my eyes like
where you put your concealer that's
where I was like I'm four I think she
put him right she put him there yeah I'm
pretty sure she
we should put it there yeah because you
want to make you know I was like you
won't even have your braid under eyes
like already back then that was like you
need to have braid under I see I totally
get it so that's where I put it in every
single one of those photos from the
event that night at the book signing
I look crazy I look insane because it
just is no it it did not look right it
did not look right I should have just
taken the time and looked up her free
new Tube video if I'm like okay oh oh
she used them on her cheekbones
I get it but like I said brand-new to
makeup people brand new to makeup didn't
quite understand illuminating and
highlighting and all that jazz so I put
it on my under eyes and I freaking just
rolled with it another like blast from
the past product that she had me buy you
guys if you've been around my channel
for a while you're gonna laugh
hysterically when I tell you this it is
the brow bar to go from whitening
lightening
yes brows brows brows brows if you're
not new to my channel I'll let you know
that I have got a lot of flack for my
brows when I started YouTube I did not
do my brows didn't know that was the
thing I started making a lot of like
Instagram videos like little like mini
tutorials over on Instagram and I was
getting called out in the worst ways for
not doing my brows like people were
DMing me like hey if you want to keep
doing makeup and doing what you do your
brows and I'm like oh okay whatever this
is proof that back in the day I I kind
of was getting it I knew that I needed
to do brows sometimes but honestly
that's not that's not the full reason
why I purchased this product like yes
she did use it for brows because it has
two different powders in here and it
also has a wax but she also used this as
like eyeshadows this was like my very
first crease color that I ever used ever
I used this in the crease all the time
and then I used this on my lid
this was my eye shadow palette when I
first started out right here
this is what it was like every once in a
while I would take the little brush that
came with it that I since lost and I'd
kind of like run it through my eyebrows
and I'm I'm like it's like I don't like
good so what I'm supposed to do it
probably wasn't what I was supposed to
do but mostly I used this for eyeshadows
so that was fun but yeah the brow bar to
go I mean she mentioned this in like
every single video when I first started
watching her videos this was always
talked about I was like I
so Lully have to have it fit and then
just the last few products here they're
both going to be collaborations that
Carly's done so one is with BH Cosmetics
like I mentioned Carly did collab with
them and she created this eye shadow and
highlighter palette so this is what the
inside of it looks like it also does
have a nice mirror so this is what looks
like so you have your eyeshadow shades
and then highlighter shades is what I'm
wearing on my eyes today I was really
excited to see Carly team up with BH
Cosmetics
mostly because Carly's the one who like
let me know about BH and I used them so
much when I was first starting out in
makeup so it was really cool to see her
team up with a more affordable brand I
know she mentioned in one of her videos
that people are like why are you teaming
up with an affordable brand like you
could have done something more high-end
and she talked about her reasons of you
know like why it being affordable to so
many people really meant a lot to her
and just how much she liked BH in the
first place and to me that really showed
me a lot about Carly because I'm sure
that she probably does have several
opportunities to work with more high-end
brands but I thought it was really
amazing that she teamed up with BH and
not only that but made a fantastic
product I love this palette I've talked
about this palette in favourites videos
I've mentioned it so much I've used it
in tutorials like I said it's on my eyes
today I just have a great time using
this palette I love that mirrors
included I love that she has like the
little penguin on the side because she
loves her penguins I love the quote in
here I don't know if you'd be able to
see it that it says aspire to inspire I
love it like from every last little
detail on this palette I loved it and I
and I paid $12.50 for it well if not me
my mom did my mom got this for me for my
birthday but also I came out this is
what I want for my birthday and it's
only $12.50 so you're welcome so thank
you to my mom for Perkins for me for my
birthday really appreciate his mom but
again just one of my favorite palettes
and I I was so incredibly happy with his
collaboration so huge congrats to Carly
I know it's an alt now which is so
exciting so amazing palettes last clap
that I want to talk about is actually
what I am wearing right now so fairly
recently it's just a couple months ago I
think it was Carly teamed up with
misguided and came out with her own like
fashion line with
guided and I was so excited like I can't
even tell you guys how excited I was for
this to me it was I've never really seen
anything done like this before I'm not
saying it hasn't because maybe it has
but for me it was the first time that I
was seeing a youtuber collapse for
fashion instead of like just makeup so
that was really exciting and then when
she came out with the video and she
showed all the clothes I was like in awe
I was like I want everything I want all
of those pieces I watched her video so
many times explaining what the products
were showing them showing them on her
she would talk about the sizes I made
notes I was so ready for that day to
come where the collection came out and
that oh man the release was a mess it
was such a hot mess Carly knew it this
guy didn't knew it everybody knew it it
was a freaking hot mess yesterday my
computer for two hours trying to buy
these items two hours I tried to buy and
it didn't work and everybody was really
upset about it and they decided that
they were going to do a relaunch and
they were gonna restock some of the
favorites so during the relaunch it went
so much smoother I just it went a lot
better so I was able to get a few pieces
I did do a clothing haul and try on that
I can link down below I don't really
know if any pieces are in stock still or
not I haven't visited the website lately
but I picked up this it is a I don't
know if people see it is a crop top and
has the turtleneck and long sleeves
which I really like and then I also
bought the matching separates which is
just like a pair of cropped pants in the
same color I love this set I love this
top I love this top I didn't think I
really would because I'm not a huge
turtleneck person but I love it it's a
lot so in another pair of matching
separates that I got cuz I'm really into
matching separates as well one was just
this blue top another crop top and then
the matching pants as well which again
were crops and I've been wearing them so
I actually had to take these out of a
laundry because I have been wearing them
lately we've been having like
unseasonable warm weather here in Iowa
so I've been wearing these but I love
them I love that they're high-waisted
they're super comfortable I think I got
size two in everything for size
reference in case these are still in
stock but each piece was only nineteen
fifty so I did not think
is bad at all and I do wear pretty
frequently I don't know I'd probably
wear man in the summer even more or if I
were to like go on vacation or things
like that cuz you know winter's coming
so crop tops and crop pants probably
aren't the best but one thing I'm super
excited to wear since fall is getting
here is I bought the rose gold bomber as
well so it is a bomber it has these
really pretty like lace sleeves right
here I loved the color
I loved the sleeves the only thing that
I don't love about it is how long it is
it's like freakishly long on me I mean I
think it's long on everybody but like on
me I'm like this is really long I don't
think it's a jacket that I can
necessarily just like grab on the go
it'd have to be like a part of the
outfit type of jacket if you know what I
mean but super excited about it I do
still need to get it steamed it hasn't
been steamed yet so it definitely needs
to be steamed but those were what I
purchased from the collab that they did
I really wish I could have gotten more I
just suppose it in a great time
financially at the moment I had just
lost one of my jobs like I've worked for
a publishing company and it closed down
so the timing was like really awful for
me but I'm still really wanted to get
stuff I wanted to support karlie but
also I thought her pieces were amazing
so I was really careful about my my
purchases and making sure what I got was
things that I knew I was gonna wear a
lot and really get a lot of use out of
so I could you know justify the purchase
in my mind but I knew that I definitely
wanted to get some from her collection
because it just looked fabulous Carlo
his fashion sense is like off the chain
here I really hope she's talked about
like doing another collab like that or
you know possibly even like or her own
clothing line in the future I really
hope that she does because I was super
impressed with what she came out with
with misguided so there's also my first
purchase ever from misguided so she
definitely recommended me to that
website and I still go on it frequently
and look at the clothes that they have
because they have some super super cute
pieces down there so if I can find
anything on carlee's that's still
available on mascara I will link it down
below I'm just not sure if there is or
not but yeah that was definitely
obviously a recommendation from Carly
alright guys those give me everything
for the Carli bybel made me buy a tag I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video as well again I chose car
you know not just because she was the
first beauty blogger that I ever watched
she also did inspire me a lot just the
same way that Jaclyn Hill did and she
was someone who I learned a lot from I
really liked when I started watching her
videos I learned a lot I you know
rewound the videos I went back I would
pause them I looked so closely at how
she did something like going to eyeliner
I mean I just I paid very close
attention to Carly because I thought her
tutorials were so helpful and she was
really someone who I credit a lot to
helping me figure out certain makeup
techniques so I definitely definitely
appreciate her for that but she's also
someone who I just think cares so much
about her subscribers I've seen some of
the giveaways that she has put together
for people and they have been seriously
amazing which is so cool and she's also
just someone who is very passionate
about whatever it is that she does and
whatever it is that she cares about you
can tell that she has a lot of passion
behind it so I think that's really
awesome I follow her obviously
basically everywhere follow her on
snapchat of course I love seeing little
glimpses into her life and and what it
is that she does and she's just like I
said she's someone who continues to
inspire me and motivate me and still
teach me things whenever she has a
tutorial
I love how close-up she gets on the eyes
so I can like really understand what it
is she's doing and where she is placing
products because seriously as someone
who's still trying to learn makeup her
tutorials are so completely helpful for
me and he actually just as someone who
also just motivates me to work hard at
what I do and continue to aspire at a
passion of mine I love her quotes that
she has in the beginning of her videos I
always read each of them and I just
think they're really special touch that
she has in there so yeah I really wanted
to focus the next video on Carly for all
of those reasons I just mentioned but if
you guys do like these videos and this
type of tag video please do let me know
