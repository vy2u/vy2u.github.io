today's video is going to be all about
the new BH Cosmetics and Carli bybel
deluxe edition eyeshadow and highlighter
palette I'm really excited to finally
have this in my hands I'm going to be
going through the palette giving you my
thoughts about it showing some swatches
I'm inserting a demo of this I like and
the space look I have all the eyeshadows
and highlighters on my face right now
and just kind of giving you my feedback
letting you know if I think this palette
is worth it or not
I also have an extra one that I picked
outside we'll be doing a giveaway for
this palette so stay tuned until the end
I will also be chatting a little bit
about these bracelets these are from
print out of beauty which is Carly
Bibles company so I picked a couple up
as well and I do have a bracelet that
will be in the giveaway also so why
don't we go ahead and get started and
chat about this eyeshadow palette ok so
I know some of you might be thinking
like girl these palettes came out a
couple weeks ago why are you just
putting your video up now and I will
tell you so if you guys tried to order
this on the launch day you know that it
was a hot mess I mean everybody knew was
a hot mess BH knew Carly knew everybody
knew it was just like a plain disaster
found the BH website at the time that it
launched I kept getting kicked off the
website kept crashing couple hours into
the launch Carly made a comment on her
snapchat like stop ordering stop trying
to order from the age it's clearly not
working they were going to take it down
off the BH website and Carly was going
to launch it on her company website
which is Pranava beauty.com
so I waited and then when it was up I
went to print out a beauty I got my two
pallets I picked out three bracelets and
call today was able to check out is in
super easy process it was really a
frustrated with the entire situation
obviously because it just took a lot of
my time trying to buy makeup and that I
was frustrated because I actually did
get charged from BH Cosmetics my bank
account was charged and at first it was
in like the holding you know like your
charges are in like ourselves hold
amount in our bank account and then they
actually process and go through so
I thought it was on the hold amount I
was like no big deal you know Carly MBAs
have both said online that none of the
orders like no one will be charged from
it if you purchase from BH all those
orders were cancelled no no charges will
go through and of course my charge went
through so then I contact BH Cosmetics
and say you know my charge went through
oh and they were like oh well we can't
find your order so we can't refund you
and I'm like no that's not right so it
was a big ordeal with BH and my bank and
just everything I finally ended up
getting refunded and the pellets were on
like a pre-order you could pre-order
them on a certain day and they were
going to ship like three weeks later and
then I start seeing people put videos up
with this palette and I'm like wait
again orders of shift I haven't got a
shipping confirmation and I started
asking my snapchat and everybody's like
yeah mine order ship my ship
I have mine and I'm thinking okay so I
wait a little bit thinking like surely
mine must be coming out soon and nothing
happened so I finally emailed print out
of a beauty and I'm like hey I just
wanted to check on my order and they're
like oh you know we're processing
everything manually but it'll be
shifting okay so eight I wait an hour
wait and you know I'm so going to do
this video I'm so phase because it's
palette so clave to do a giveaway for
everyone this is my month of May
giveaways up so many giveaways going on
right now then at wait a little bit
longer and still not coming in someone
from my snapchat tagged me and Carly and
pH on Twitter and said have you got your
palette yet or have you got your
shipping information and I said no not
yet you know I'm feeling super
frustrated and Carli bybel
actually direct message me on Twitter
that was like hallo what is going on and
I explained the situation tour I was
like you know I'm just really frustrated
I even said in my message I'm like yeah
I'm a small youtuber and I try to
purchase new makeup releases early so I
can get my videos out so I can get my
reviews out so I can try to help people
who are wondering if they should get the
palette and I'm just really bummed that
this is happening and you know I said
not always that I ordered an extra
pellet or a bracelet like I spent over a
hundred dollars and nothing's happening
with my order and at one point when I
emailed print out of beauty they were
like oh I checked on your order and it's
still in the warehouse we don't have an
expected ship date now look what do you
mean how come everybody else is getting
their pallets
- still sitting in a warehouse was no
expected ship date how does that happen
so I let Carly know about information as
well and she was like no we'll get on it
today we'll get it shipped out like I'm
so sorry about this give it a few hours
and she still haven't heard from her
have a beauty team at that time like let
me know but we'll get to six today we
did six hours and I emailed Carly I was
like you know I hate to do this but can
I just cancel my order I just found out
that I needed to have my wisdom tooth
extraction I knew it was going to cost a
lot of money and I knew I was probably
going to be down and out for a while so
I was like can I just cancel it and get
my money back like if it doesn't even
have an expected ship date like how long
am I going to be waiting and she was
like no worries well I'll get you refund
it right away but we'll still send you
out your package you know as an apology
and you know hope you love your goodies
so I was like what is like that is
insane I did not expect that at all I
did not expect a package I didn't ask
for it I didn't say like oh you should
still fund me of my stuff I just want to
refine I I just want my money back so
that's it kind of a part of me was like
oh I don't know they refunded me right
away and I was like I don't know maybe
the package won't ever ship or maybe it
won't for another month like who
knows but it actually shipped like right
away I think because I got the Box like
four or five days after having that
conversation with Carly so she sent me
everything both pallets and the three
braces that I ordered and still refunded
me my money and either thought that was
very very cool not something that they
had to do at all and I'm just extremely
grateful for that and it just makes me
appreciate Carly so much more Curly's
than one of my favorite youtubers for
such a long time but to see her as also
a businesswoman and see how much she
cares about her business was really
something to me when my snapchat friend
messaged me on Twitter and which he tied
Carly in BH Carly direct messaged me
like within five minutes and she was on
my messages every time I wrote her
message back she responded to me right
away and I was very impressed I don't
know if a lot of people would go above
and beyond like that and she really did
and then to still send me the package
completely free like I was just
I just thought that was really truly
amazing I'm sorry our son keeps going up
and down to my lighting might be
changing but I just thought that was
really really amazing so I know I'm kind
of making this video a little bit longer
because I wanted to tell that story but
hey I wanted to explain why this video
is coming too late but B I just really
wanted to give a shout out to Carly
because I was very impressed like not
only was the pH launch going absolutely
horrendous and she stepped in and fixed
it but going on for now but beauty but
then I see her not only just to me but I
see her on Twitter and Instagram like
responding to people and trying to get
help for people and then in my situation
what she did for me like I'm just so so
very thankful and just grateful and I
just wanted to share that story because
I just thought that was amazing I just I
think she doesn't think things I've
continually been impressed with Carly
not only for what she does on camera but
for a lot of what she does
off camera I'll talk about her company
purnama beauty and a bit as well and
kind of what she's doing there but I
want to let you guys know it's why this
is a little bit late and just give a
huge shout out I mean not that I need a
shadow currently by any means but just
let you guys know that I just thought
that was really cool
so let's actually get into the palette
now I'll give you my thoughts on it I
will insert some swatches in here like I
normally do but I will go through and
pick out a few of my favorite shades and
go through these swatches with you that
way as well the first three rows are eye
shadows and things these all down here
are highlighters this is the deluxe
edition eyeshadow and highlighter
palette because this is the original so
you can tell that it is much smaller in
size and the original came with 14
different shades versus the 21 our
repeat shades which at first I was like
like it kind of bugged me out a little
bit but I also kind of get it but Carly
did mention in her video when she talked
about the palette that they did work on
the formula and they kind of gave it a
boost and I would have to agree with
that I could tell that the shades in the
newer palette were butter in here now I
do like this palette I recommend it a
lot I have used it a lot I have traveled
with those a lot and I really did like
it but definitely the shadows in here
were step up I could also tell I didn't
feel like this one had a ton a ton of
Fallout but it had a little bit and they
were a little bit powdery and I was very
very impressed when I was flying with I
had no fallout no fallout whatsoever and
I really didn't think the shadows were
too powdery again like just a little bit
but I mean even I just use this there's
like no color residue on the actual
pallet I was super impressed with it so
I was very happy about that
this original pellet has been
discontinued I think it was the day that
this went on the pre-order this one was
discontinued to enjoy that it does have
the mirror and it does have Carly's
quote aspire to inspire in there I love
the mirror I think it's a really nice
mirror I think this is still travel
friendly especially because it does have
the mirror but it's a very thin and I
think that it would be easy to travel
with which I do appreciate that
so the palette when I got it was in 1950
it is in fact right now on the BH
website I will have it linked down below
of course and it is still 1950 I did
hear that the purse is going to go up to
2250 I'm not effectively positive when
that date is going into effect it was
still 1950 2250 I mean that's still
really fantastic price for an eyeshadow
palette that I think it's really good
quality and has a really beautiful
shades inside so I just I'm very
impressed
again impressed that Carly teams up with
affordable brands because not all of us
combined are really expensive things and
you know we love to support our
youtubers and it's really nice when they
do collabs with affordable brands like
BH like color pops and that sort of
thing it just really it is very helpful
to our wallet so inside these are all of
the beautiful shades and I really enjoy
this palette because these shades are so
me we have beautiful bronze we have
beautiful box and they're what I like
about this palette the shimmers are
absolutely stunning like I swear I
bought this helmet like for those shade
which is all over my lids there's
definitely more matte transition shades
in here there really wasn't a ton and
the other palette and sometimes that can
make it a little bit difficult so I
really like that we added a few more of
those matches in there so I'll go
through and share some of my favorite
shades in here these two are from the
bro the first one is what I have all
over my lid right now and I just thought
it was beautiful like a pinky peachy
type of shift and then this one I can't
wait to put that one on my lid as well I
think that one looks stunning
again these shimmers are just like the
shimmers of the ones that are really
calling out to me but the maps are
fantastic and we need that I like at
least I do
I typically always need a mat and then
here are two more shimmers from the
second row or both very varied this one
on the end I'm really excited to put on
my eyes as well so I thought that one
swatch really beautifully a highlights
I'd be really excited as well especially
these two like bars of highlights I
thought were really pretty since what I
have on my teeth once a day and like
look at that like it is so so stunning
excited about the gold for summer like
when I have a bit of a tan I think it
will look really pretty I mean those are
just stunning I had to do two more
highlights that are kind of more what I
would normally wear these are the first
two in the bottom row and like look at
those it's crazy
super pigmented super beautiful when
though I said I want to cancel the order
I still wanted the palette I was
planning on just picking it up from Ulta
booyah when it came available they're
like you know don't harm no foul so get
the palette I'm tile it wasn't something
it's like especially with the other one
it wasn't something that like if you
didn't get it within the first five
minutes you weren't going to be able to
get it at all which is another thing I
very highly appreciate so two will be
for sale at Ulta as well but seriously I
mean both the eye shadows and the
highlights
they swatch very beautifully but then
they actually look really good on the
eye as well I'll be inserting a demo in
here also but I did a pretty simple
standard smith ilyich which is what i
like to do when I am using a new palette
but I used this matte brown shade and I
used a little bit of this matte color as
well in my crease and then I did put
this really beautiful like I was so
excited when I saw that shade when this
palette first launched a pinky peach
beautiful shimmer color I put that all
over my lid and I absolutely loved it
and again I did put this first
highlighter on my cheekbones which I
thought looked amazing so after I put
everything on my eyes I got even more
impressed I thought they blend it out
really well I thought they were
segmented like I mentioned before mill
fallout there was no fallout on my face
at all and I didn't see that they were
super powdery and I just I thought they
were amazing
the shimmer color that I used on my eyes
I did not use any fix+ a lot of times
when I am using a mule a shadow pellet I
will not use a fix+ because I know not
everybody likes to use eye makeup mist
with their eyeshadows and I know not
everybody has some sort of like 6 plus
or anything like that to use on our eye
shadows so when I get a new I show
pellet I like to test it as is and see
what it's all about and this definitely
passed the test I thought it showed up
beautifully without needing any sort of
help with it I think if I were to use
the fix plus it just looked very it
would look much more like metallic which
is what still be super pretty but
definitely it's not something that you
need so this isn't a palette that needs
additional reinforcements to help it
show up I thought it was beautiful so
overall I have been super happy with
this palette I'm really thankful that
Carly sent this to me I really am
super shocked but super super grateful
because I had such a fun time playing
with it I think it's going to be a
beautiful spring/summer palette I'm
super excited about all these highlights
in here in the beautiful eyeshadow
shades so if you are still thinking
about getting this palette it definitely
gets my stamp of approval if that means
anything to you but I think is really
beautiful it definitely want that I will
be playing with if you do have the
original palette I mean it's definitely
still a good palette but for sure this
one is a step up from that one so if
you're a huge fan of BH if you're a huge
fan of Carly or you just love new
eyeshadow palettes you like affordable
eyeshadow palettes I think this would be
a good choice for your collection I was
very happy with it so like I mentioned I
did purchase two bracelets for myself
from purnama Beauty when I bought the
palace so Carly came out with four
different bracelet designs and then part
of the proceeds go to a charity I will
have pronoun UT linked down below so you
can read all about it there I really
don't want to like misspeak and say
something incorrectly on behalf of Carly
or behalf of the charity and so I will
have the website linked down below watch
our vlog all about the charity and her
bread actually taking the trip and being
a
to deliver a check and it was really
amazing like it makes me want to tear up
I think it's really cool to see people
with a platform like this that maybe
isn't like a traditional platform like a
celebrity to see her work so
passionately and have a dedication
outside of you know all that other stuff
I think it's really inspiring and so
it's really excited to support but not
only that I just like loved at the
bracelet I can do a bit of a close up
here so I got a gold one in a silver one
for myself one says serenity and then
one it says Fallon and they do have the
crystals on here and I just thought that
they were really beautiful they're very
like dainty and feminine and if you like
that kind of look I would definitely say
to check them out they are $20 apiece
but again of her that it's going to a
charity which I just think it's really
amazing it's kind of shift over into the
giveaway because I do have a bracelet
included in the giveaway so I do have a
texture palette it isn't here it is in
the bubble wrap I'm not taking it out of
the package at all but there is another
pellet in here for you guys which I'm
very excited about to be giving one away
