today's video is just going to be a
casual probably chatty get ready with me
I'm just gonna be doing some makeup here
on camera I have some new makeup to play
with it that I'm pretty excited about
some will be first impressions some I've
already been trying but it's still new
to the market and then I also do want to
add in doing my hair and then it's
showing my outfit for this get ready
with me as well I've seen a couple of
requests that come in to do this and I
thought maybe it could be fun so I'm
gonna go ahead and do my makeup first
and then I will show hair and then also
some outfit details as well so if you
are ready for a little get ready with me
why don't we go ahead and get started or
we jump into the makeup - I did just put
my ears on but there is gonna be a
giveaway in this video as well I really
enjoy it the brand yard watches I have
one of their wood watches already and
they asked if I would want to do a
giveaway with them this is not a
sponsored video or anything like that
it's just going to be a giveaway in this
video so go ahead and check the
description box I'll go ahead and go
into a little bit more detail and
they'll watch just when I go into the
outfit portion visit my newest watch it
from them and I just think this watch is
so beautiful
I did mention your watches in my latest
gift guide that I did and I said that
they do make a really beautiful gift for
females this again is my latest watch
and I do have another one from them also
but I said that I actually get a lot of
compliments on my watches from men which
i think is pretty funny and my husband
is super super into these and I've been
wanting to get him one for a while as
well but yeah go ahead check the
description box there's a giveaway down
there if you are interested in some more
information and again I'll touch on this
when I get into the outfit portion but I
did want to throw that out there makeup
time let's get to it so I am going to
start with my face I'm going to use
these Smashbox a photo finish primer
Iser I just picked this one up in my
latest haul and I haven't tried it out
yet because I've been trying another
primer to review in my next make up
monthly and I feel like I have a pretty
good review down for it so now I'm going
to switch over and start trying out this
guy which I'm really excited about
so that has hyaluronic acid in it which
makes me pretty excited a mini guide but
it was $15 which I didn't think was bad
because the full-size is like $42 but
people actually comment it in my
nopal and said it's what it looks like
they said that it's actually a better
deal to get the mini like you get more
per fluid ounce or something for the
price which I thought was pretty sweet
so I'll be testing this one out because
I will be doing a follow-up to my haul
and also to my latest first impressions
video that I did I think it was last
week so Haitian I'm gonna use as the
Becca ultimate coverage complexion creme
I did use this in my first impression
video as well and it's the foundation
that you know I always link out all my
makeup in my description box and you
probably been seeing this one quite a
bit but I do want to get my review for
it which means I wear it a lot my shade
is in buttercup which I don't think is
the best shade match for me and it's
kind of yellow but that's okay that's
okay we still make it work
I'm gonna use my Sigma 3d HD max kabuki
I forgot helpful coverage this is I did
not need that many pumps especially when
using a brush like I do my eyes first
and I'm gonna use the color drain Queen
of Hearts palette today which I'm so
excited about to me the first time I
just got it in the mail so I'm really
excited but I thought I would do more of
a because like my first impression video
I did more of a colorful look with a
dubious placed palette and I did lashes
and all of that so I figured for today I
would do not quite as intense of a look
and like no lashes and things like that
I swear every time I use that foundation
I'm like I forget how full coverage it
is like you need such little product
because it's super liquidy too for my
concealer I'm going to use this
covergirl buy Tillis healthy concealer I
don't doesn't have my shade on here I
don't know if it says my shade on here
that's kind of weird and this is a new
product from covergirl they did send me
a package with some items in here it is
like you twist it up which I don't
prefer those types of concealers but I'm
just gonna go ahead and put some on my
under eyes because I thought I have to
like keep twisting it I don't know I
just I prefer a regular applicator um
I'm gonna put some on my eyelids as well
to act as my primer use this yesterday
as well so this is just my second time
using it and again it's just it's not my
favorite applicator ever and
I don't know I didn't quite like
following up with it on first impression
but I definitely want to keep trying it
and see what I think I'm using a Sephora
57 brush to blend this out I took my
acrylics off the other night and wow
that was that was a process I have been
getting my nails done like getting our
critics put on on a like fairly regular
ish basis since I was probably like 16
years old I've just always loved having
nails because my nails are terrible I
mean keep in mind that I did just take
off acrylics three days ago four days
ago but these are what my nails just
look like anyways like that's what they
look like they peel though and they
crack they don't grow like I just have
never really enjoyed my actual nails and
that's why I've been getting fake nails
like forever
but I am in need of a new nail salon
I've been going there since last summer
I think I started going in like June or
July and I finally found a tech there
who I really liked and he was the owner
and he was really nice and I felt like
he always did a good job
I felt like once I started becoming a
railer there and consistently going to
him like requesting him like all of a
sudden like I felt like my appointments
for being like really rushed and like
there was just certain things that he
wasn't do it like even just like
cleaning up the nails and things like
that did I notice that he wasn't really
doing any more and I was like okay what
if you want to keep your like regular
even happier like I don't know it was
starting to frustrate me and then around
that same time my nails started breaking
a ton like just I mean I would like to
smooth and my acrylic with split and I'm
like what is happening here it wouldn't
even be like getting a nail jammed or
something third would be for no reason
like I would set my hand like on my
keyboard nail breaks I'm like what is
going on here this is ridiculous he
started adding like a clear gel polish
to my nails because they said it would
help keep them stronger and I paint my
nails at home I just I have a huge nail
polish collection I like painting my own
nails I have no problem doing it and I
prefer it and so he was like well I'll
put a gel polish
because like I don't know it was almost
like you tried to blame me like will you
change your nail polish color so that's
why they're breaking and I'm like I
don't think so because that's what I've
been doing for a very long time but okay
I had a nail break once and I went in
there to get it fixed and he wasn't
there like my regular guy wasn't there
and so someone else did it and they like
didn't hell that was broken they took
the tip off completely put a new tip on
but then when they went to like file it
a they kept it really long like it was
weirdly long and then they filed it
completely differently from my other
nails and what kind of like put me over
the edge was last Friday we were gonna
go to a concert we were leaving like
early afternoon to go out of town cuz we
had tickets for a concert and my nail
split at like 8:30 in the morning I
looked down at my computer and my nail
had just completely split half the
acrylic was gone and I'm like what the
heck even happened what like how how is
this happening and I just got my nails
filled last week so I'm like what in the
world so I go to the nail salon and he
is not there and I hear him say that the
guys on vacation which I'm like okay
bummer so guy comes out and starts to
fix my nail takes the rest of the
acrylic off and doesn't put a new tip on
just puts the gel over my regular nail
and I'm like what does it happen what is
happening here and then it like doesn't
file it it doesn't do anything like
literally it just puts the gel wad and
then kind of like just the powder away
and he's like okay you're good I'm like
I don't think I am I why did you not put
what just happened here and so I leave
and when I leave I post a photo of it on
Twitter and maybe snapchat too there was
so much gel piled up behind my there was
like a mountain of gel you could ski on
the amount of gel that was behind my
nail and I'm like how did this just
happen so I come home and I paint my
nail to match the other nails and it
just it looks different and then
immediately the nail polish starts
chipping I mean it was a couple hours
later don't get me
but within a few hours my nail had
started chipping and then two days later
the nail broke anyways I was like
because it was my real nail it wasn't a
fake nail what what is going on here and
so that happened so when my real nail
broke and then three other nails broke I
just was like no no no so I just I just
took my nails off and we're gonna get a
new nail place we're gonna get a new
nail place okay I'm gonna switch over to
my eyes for a little bit I'm going to
use the color drain a Queen of Hearts
palette I'm so excited about this but I
do not know who sent it to me there
wasn't a note with it
and I'm fairly confident and didn't come
from color green so I said something on
a few of my social media platforms that
there was no note with it but I'm so
excited I'm so excited about this one
this is such a hyped and like a loved on
palette and I feel like what like put
color green like on the map so I'm so
excited this isn't my first time getting
into it and I mean she looks beautiful
I'm sure you've seen it plenty of times
before but there's what she looks like
so I'm gonna take a real techniques this
is a deluxe concealer brush and I'm
gonna pick up the shade err right here
and since I did put the concealer on my
lid I'm just gonna go ahead and put this
over into to make applying the shadows
real smooth so like I was saying with my
nails I have the sony a 5100 so I just
had to give it some time to cool down
and whatnot but I decided to just take
the acrylics off and just try to start
somewhere new but I'm going to put some
Royal Prerogative
onto my volume tools blending brush and
put that into the crease so we had a new
nail place just open up in town where I
live and I was saying something too much
about it like oh maybe I should try that
place you know just something like her
new and different and whatnot and he
actually surprised me with a mani pedi
to them for Valentine's Day which I'm
filming on Valentine's Day I hope you
guys all had a great one um so he
surprised me with that and I was so
excited and it's funny because he
actually gave me the my gifts on Monday
because he called me he's like what are
you doing I go taking my nails off and
he was like what I was like
I'm just decided that I just need to
start over I need to find a new place
etc and so he came home and it's like
well I'm gonna give you your Valentine's
Day present early and so he gives me
that along with an ice cream cake which
is delicious
and he's like he's like I wasn't gonna
give it to you this early but I didn't
know if you were gonna like go to the
new nail place tomorrow and I want you
to have your gift card and all that
which was super funny so nice of them
I'm really excited about this I haven't
gotten a pedicure in two years it was
the last time I did one was my birthday
two years ago so I'm really excited
about the pedicure we get some new nails
put on um so I was like well maybe I'll
leave my nails off for like a week or
two or whatever and I immediately it was
like this is not gonna work like they
just they look horrible I can't type I
feel like I'm like ah when I'm typing
because I'm just I'm not used to it I
can't text oh my goodness
you know first role problems over here
but I was like oh man I'm probably gonna
cave and get my nails done sooner and
then it gives me the gift cards so I'm
gonna point out for Thursday morning so
I'm pretty excited about it I grab a
smaller Sigma e25 I'm going to use the
shape princess and put that one into the
crease as well but I took my nails off
and I'd asked on Twitter like what's the
best way to take nails off and everybody
was like oh you know soaked like a
cotton ball and acetone and then wrap it
with tinfoil and I'm like that never has
worked for me cuz like I said I've had
nails a very long time and I've tried to
take them off by myself and that's what
I've tried doing I'm like that has never
worked for me like why why is that like
even in a salon when they've tried
taking off their then they still have to
it's so painful they like take another
nail and pry my nail off and it's so so
I'm like what am I doing wrong like
clearly there has to be something that
I'm not doing and finally someone wrote
in and they said that you really have to
file your nails down before you do the
acetone because you need to basically
kind of like file away the top coat of
gel or something like that so that the
acetone is actually penetrating the
acrylic instead of just sitting on top
of the nail or something along those
lines so I was like okay I can I can
file my nails and so I spent a good 20
minutes of filing my nails
and it looked like there was snow all
over my hands but I was like okay I feel
like I did a really good job there and
then I soaked a you know like little
pieces of cotton balls in straight
acetone wrapped them with tin foil and I
let him sit for 20 minutes and then when
I took him off and started to like push
it with like a little
cuticle thingy it did it came right off
I was like oh my gosh so if you try to
take your acrylics off at home make sure
to file them like crazy before you
actually go in with the acetone because
that is what worked for me and I was
really happy about it I just don't like
getting to take them off at the salon
because I feel like it hurts so bad and
I cry and I'm a baby
it's embarrassing people look at me so
now that I finally figured out how to
get them off at home and what the trick
is I'm much happier about that but we'll
see how my payment goes tomorrow I'm
excited I don't know if I've ever had my
nails and my toes done at the same time
like I feel like I'm gonna be there for
so long but I'm excited for it these
shades are applying really nicely very
pigmented easy to blend really happy
right now I want to take this shade
royal highness it's kind of like a
lighter purple shimmer I'm gonna use the
Sigma E 54 and put that onto my lid I'm
not gonna use any setting spray first
because I just want to see kinda how it
applies before I do that okay I feel
like it applies pretty well but it is
such a really intense shimmer I am gonna
do some setting spray mostly because I
have done my face in my concealer and I
don't want to get too much fallout
either but I would have to clean up so
let me spray my brush shot my brush is
sprayed and we will see how that applies
now what they damp brush oh yeah see I
just really like to spray my brush with
all my shimmers I just feel like it
really brings brings it out but then it
does also help not having as much
fallout to so I'm just gonna place that
on the inner part of my lid and like I
said I don't want to do anything too
crazy today I tried to since I'm doing
more either like get ready with me their
first impressions or things like that
I'm gonna try to flip it back and forth
like more colorful or lashes or just
more an intricate and then you know
something a little bit more simpler no
lashes things like that so I'll try to
kind of go back and forth here as a
spell
tines day do you guys do anything for
Valentine's Day I'm filming this on
Wednesday which is Bella pen today and
we actually went out for dinner last
night cuz I was like no I do not I do
not do anything on Valentine's Day I
don't want to go anywhere and like kind
of a fun story when I was dating Mitch
we've been dating or we've been together
for 11 years they started dating in
college and we've been dating for
probably we were probably running the
one-year mark and Valentine's Day came
up and he asked like what I wanted to do
and I was like I don't want to do
anything I don't want to go anywhere
like it's just it's too busy it's too
crazy you know I don't like to go out on
Valentine's Day and I think he thought I
was gonna be that girl that was like I
don't want to do anything for
Valentine's Day and then when we didn't
do anything for Valentine's Day I was
gonna be like why don't we do anything
for Valentine's Day you are the worst
boyfriend ever
so he made dinner reservations at a
nicer place in town and I served for us
we were in college our first date was at
Applebee's my joob but that was pretty
good some college kids okay but so he
makes the reservation and he's like oh
we're going here tonight and I'm like
okay and I'm like well maybe it won't be
as bad if he made a reservation like we
won't have to wait forever
we still had to wait like 40 minutes but
we had to wait such a long time and I
was like are you sure you made
reservations and he's like no I did like
I did make reservation and I finally
seen us and they had one of those like
limited menus because it's Valentine's
Day and it's special so there was only
like six different things you could
order from and nugge foam was like my
staples because in college I was super
super picky with food like typically
when we would not to eat chicken strips
chicken strips that's what I ate it was
chicken strips and there was no chicken
strips on the limited venue and I had to
choose something else I was like this is
why I don't want to go out for
Valentine's Day like I wasn't kidding I
wasn't I wasn't trying to like set you
up to fail man I would have been so
happy that in the dorm room watching
Talladega Nights and eating popcorn like
that would have been fantastic so yeah
we don't do anything on actual
Valentine's Day it's just it's not
really not really our thing eyeliner I'm
going to use this mr. right from the
balm it's a purple eyeliner
which I feel like could maybe go with
this look so I'm just gonna add this to
the water line and smudge a little bit
below my lash line and then since I'm
not doing lashes today I'm gonna come in
with the Maybelline net total temptation
mascara this is just my favorite mascara
right now so I wanted to apply this to
my lashes and then I'm just gonna do my
brows off-camera because that takes me a
while to do and since I'm adding in
outfit and hair I know this is gonna be
a longer video anyways in like my nail
story probably took up what 15 minutes
of this video so I'm just gonna go ahead
and do my brows off-camera and the
interest of saving some time here to do
my brows before I finish off my face I'm
just going in to finish off the eyes
because it's going to be really simple
I'm just gonna do the brown and the
mauve here and put them on to the lower
lash line with the morphe M 5:07 it was
always going on a stack and I felt like
I was just this was a palette that just
wasn't meant to be with me so thank you
so much to who sent it please tell me
who you are so I could say thank you to
take a little bit of crown and put that
on the inner corner as well with the
morphe 36 know we've had so much like
love and support with everything going
on with Mitch's job and whatnot and I
don't have anything like official to say
yet but I think like maybe some time
soon I'll have something to say everyone
of course as always for the love and
support and messages and emails and all
of that and really awesome and it's been
it truly has helped get through
everything so I just I appreciate it so
much that's gonna do it for the eyes
though for my bronzer I do want to try
this new bronzer from the balm they're
coming out with the take home the bronze
bronzers and they have three different
shades tawny is like the medium shade I
would say so that's the one that I
wanted to try today and I'm going to use
the Mota buffer brush as a bronzer brush
and it does have a mirror here so I
think you can pre-order these on the
balm website right now and then they
ship like early March it's so exciting
that ivory
I gotten on the bombs PR liske because
very lou manizer from the balm was my
first ever highlight that I bought and
so I don't know it's just like one of
those weird things like to get noticed
by the bomb it just feels like so
freakin cool but when they sent over
these bronzers I was like a little
bronzer so much so I was so excited when
I saw that so I'm just gonna go ahead
and browse up at the skin here but yeah
like I said I think things are going in
a good direction but I and I don't want
to say anything for sure until we do
know because if it's going where I think
we're going it's actually gonna be a
fairly large like life change and like
moving it and things like that so if it
doesn't work out that way and we do end
up like staying here and staying in this
area and whatnot I mean that's totally
okay too but there is the the
possibility of that happening as well so
that's kind of stressful to think about
yeah that's just a little to think about
I've never this is our first home so
I've never had to deal with like selling
a home while trying to buy a new home
and that just sounds like a really
stressful time to me yeah hopefully soon
I'll have something to say whether it
goes one way or goes another way we
don't know we don't know we'll just see
where life takes us for my highlight I
want to use pillow talk from Oprah my
friend Ellie sent this to me and I am so
excited because I think it's so
beautiful I'm gonna use the Dell iam
tools at tapered contour brush for this
one and I did try this out the other day
and I thought it was so starting over on
highlights man they do not play around
and they just look wet on this skit like
look at that and I just into the
highlight I mean that is some craziness
I saw a comment on one of my videos
recently and it said people were saying
pillow talk was not like the other over
highlights and did I think that and
honestly I don't think that I think it's
the same I mean over highlights to me
are just like blinding you need so
little product it looks really nice on
the skin it does look the same so I
think it's gorgeous and I'm super into
the pink highlights right now so I'm
gonna do just a little bit on the
bridge of the nose and the tip of nose
as well and then that's gonna be it for
that highlight this spray my face before
I do my lip color with the covergirl
look lock up all day setting mist can I
get the cap off this is new from
covergirl excuse me the first time I'm
using it so I'm just gonna go ahead and
do a quick spray here first thoughts I
did not like the sprayer it like oh I
don't know I didn't do like a fine all
over Miss it was like in your face in
your face I don't know if I really loved
that I'll try it a few more times but
that was like very intense each spot
that I sprayed so alright I'll try that
a few more times but moving on to my lip
color I was really excited because a
Lollis reached out to me and they send
me some lip products and I'm so excited
I'm so intrigued by this brand I know
they're coming in to Sephora soon so
when they offered to send over some
lipsticks I was like please I'm so
freaking pumped about this so this is
their soft matte liquid lipsticks and
have Leo and George and I think I'm
gonna go with George let's go with
George Leo and George also sent me Dane
which is kind of a more uh
Vampir shade but I did want to do a new
today because when don't I want to do a
nude I don't know it's Valentine's Day
it just seems right it just seems right
to do a nude today so there's what the
applicator looks like it almost has like
a candy scent to it but it applied
really easily that's just one layer I
don't even feel like I need to do a
second one so really enjoying that color
I really like how it looks with the eye
look as well mm-hmm I like it this is my
first time trying it so of course I'll
be testing it out to review and all of
that good stuff but again this one was
George I really like that so this is the
final makeup look so I will also do hair
in alpha I'm gonna do hair net I think
I'm just gonna pop in some extensions I
don't really have a lot of hair skills
so there's that but let me go grab my
extensions and we'll do something with
this hat mess of the hair so for my hair
I'm just gonna be clipping in some
extensions these are what my new
extensions will look like I did get
these sent me from amazing Beauty this
is what the box of the thang
looks like so I've been trying these out
for a while I mean I don't know how many
times I've worn them it's been quite a
few you've been seeing me wear them in
videos so I always get comments of like
but your hair looks really good today
I'm like yeah cuz it's extensions I know
so because I'm on like day 4 hair right
now I'm just gonna spray it some a dry
shampoo in here first this is from a dry
bar it's the detox at dry shampoo so I
just kind of lifts my hair up and spray
at the roots I'm not a hair person like
I've been asked for like hair tutorials
and things like that I'm just not good
with hair um I hope to be one day I said
like one of my 2018 resolutions I just
kind of shake it through what am i 2018
resolutions is to like be better with my
hair and like figure out how to style it
and the best products to use for it so
I've been testing out some new products
and brands and things like that and
trying to find like what works the best
for my hair I like using the direction
of food too because I feel like it kind
of gives me a little bit of volume which
helps with these extensions or with any
extensions really so for my extensions I
just make sure everything is unclipped
and then I do it by sections what I do
is I do this for clip in the back and
then I have two one clips and I do them
like more towards the front so I just
make sure I have my hair tie and then I
section off my hair above my ears this
is kind of hard to do by myself
I filmed by myself so it's a little
challenging to do hair stuff then I will
take the four clip and I start on this
side and I would just clip it in and
make sure it's secure over here first
and then I just follow along the rest of
my hairline till I get to the other side
and then clip it down I just want to
make sure it's really secure and tight
to my head so that way it's not like
loose or like having my hair down you
can't see like a lump it back there and
then I'll take this aside down and for
this side I like to kind of have my
clips close to each other though
actually so like I can tell my clip is
over here so I'm just gonna bring down a
little bit of hair again hard to do hard
to do by myself this might not be the
best application you've ever
seen in your life but then I just take
the one clip and again I just make sure
it's tight to my hat like that and then
I do the same thing on the other side I
find where that clip is and then I'll go
ahead and clip this guy on the side kind
of in the back now I have my extensions
in and I feel like they blend really
well I'll have my details down below
I'll have the link to them and then I'll
have like which extensions I have
because I feel like it blends in really
nicely with my hair it's the viol lash
extension so everything linked down
below
I know amazing Beauty did give me a coat
as well if you're interested in
extensions it's just a discount code for
you and I feel confident recommending
them because I've been wearing them so
much lately but it's not an affiliate
code for me so I don't to make any money
off of it but if you've been looking for
some extensions this is like the extent
of what I do with my hair when I put
extensions in sometimes I will curl them
but not usually I try not to use a lot
of heat on my hair because my hair is
already very damaged but I think just
adding in three clips of extensions I
mean it just it gives me more volume it
obviously gives me more length I really
like these extensions because they are
so soft like so soft even my husband
commented on how soft my hair was in the
middle of the rock concert and made my
other friend touch my hair so if you can
see how soft my hair was which was
really funny so I've been really liking
theists but I like the way that this
looks so that's all that I do for my
hair most days I know pretty well and
crazy sometimes I'll put hairspray in it
too but why don't we go ahead and get
changed and I'll show you my outfit
alrighty welcome to my bedroom and this
is the outfit that I have we have areas
here with us as well so this is my
completed look my top is from honey bum
and I really enjoyed it is a cropped
sweater and then it has these kind of
like details right here I liked it so
much I got it in this kind of like burnt
orange color and then I also got it in
red and I really enjoy it my jeans are
from a fashion Nova and my boots are
also from a fashion Nova they do have
quite a heel on them but I do think that
they are pretty comfortable and this is
actually an outfit that I wore out just
the other weekend so I thought I could
share it as well
or my jewelry I did just put in like a
little stud earrings I don't wear
earrings much but I've been trying to
wear them more so I put some earrings in
and then I also have my watch here from
yard like I mentioned they are doing a
giveaway with me in this video it's not
a sponsored video but I thought it would
be pretty cool to do a giveaway with
them because I really do enjoy these
watches I will have this one linked down
below and I really liked the kind of
bigger face on it was really stylish and
it could pair well with any outfit then
I feel like is more of like a classic
watch for outfits where my other one if
you've seen me wear a wood watch and
other outfits I feel like that one is
more casual and then this one could be
like my little bit of a nicer watch but
I'll have it linked down below as well
as all of the giveaway details and
things like that but I really enjoyed
these watches I get a lot of compliments
on them especially from men when I put
this in my gift guide I said that as
well I have so many guys compliment me
when I wear my wood watches which i
think is really funny so that will be
down below but here is my outfit so
after that that is gonna do it for the
get ready with me with my hair my makeup
