today's video is obviously going to be a
different style of video if you can't
tell since I'm in my bedroom so Poshmark
reached out to me again and asked if I
would want to work on another video with
them and I decided to do kind of like a
dresser declutter if you see this
dresser in the background you can see
how some of the drawers are still not
fully shut I've been meaning to go
through that dresser for the longest
time because I can't close so many of
the drawers and I wanted to be able to
get rid of a bunch of things either just
declutter them um if they need to be
tossed or thrown away or to add them to
my Poshmark account so when they reached
out and asked me I was like yes and
let's do a clothes declutter so this
video is sponsored by Poshmark so big
thank you to them for working with me
again and I thought I could do this kind
of style video where I'm actually
wearing the pieces of clothing that I
will be adding to my Poshmark app I saw
Jackie I'm gonna do something kind of
similar to this the other day and so I
thought that was a fun idea so that is
what we are going to be doing so if you
are interested in seeing kind of like a
decluttering of my closet slash dresser
and some of the items that I'm going to
be adding it to my Poshmark account why
don't I go ahead and get started ready
so of course I will have my Poshmark
closet linked down below of the Poshmark
app link down below if you haven't seen
my previous videos Poshmark is just a
free app where you can sell the items
that you do not want any longer I have a
ton of clothes up on my Poshmark app a
ton of them I just did a really really
big closet declutter not too long ago
and like I said I'm excited to work on
this dresser because it needs help it's
a lot of help so I thought it could be
kind of fun or to do it this way I'm
actually seeing me try on the clothes
instead of just me going through my
dresser so I did that this morning I've
no makeup on it's still fairly early but
I thought it could be a lot more fun
than just seeing me like pull stuff out
of my dresser so hopefully that makes
sense but first I'm gonna focus on the
bottoms that I'm wearing so this top
won't be included it's just the top I
was wearing so first I'm gonna go
through all of the like leggings that I
have a lot of it is going to be leggings
workout leggings and then I have some
sports bras as well but this is the
first pair here and this is
from a Victoria Secret I really really
like these leggings and once I put them
on I was like oh do I want to sell these
but I haven't worn them in such a long
time and I know that it's just time to
get rid of them I have a thing for
leggings I just this is what I wear the
most I work from home so I love my
leggings these are from at Victoria's
Secret
they're kind of like a grayish like
almost like a grey purple and then they
have this kind of see-through detailing
that goes all the way down to the ankle
and it is on both they're not
high-waisted and other series I was
wondering when she was gonna come in
they are not high waisted and I tend to
lean more towards high waist at liking
so I think that's another reason why I
don't reach for them a ton I'll have a
girlfriend but these are the first pair
of leggings I have another pair like
these in another color that I will also
be adding to my Poshmark but they're
really comfortable I believe they're a
size small I'll have all of the details
of course listed on the app as well but
this is the first pair of leggings so
the next pair is the same thing except
these are in kind of like a olive green
type of color and then the detailing is
more on the side of the leg versus the
other ones which were more down the
front of the leg but you still have the
whole side leg on both side that has
kind of a sheer panel with some designs
in it so again it's it's the exact same
pair from Victoria's Secret not
high-waisted or anything like that but
they go all the way down to the ankle I
feel like they're very comfortable I
used to wear them out quite a bit but
like I said I just I kind of prefer high
waist at these days so I just find
myself not reaching for them a ton but
this is another pair from Victoria's
Secret that will be going up on Poshmark
next up I have a pair of crop workout
leggings these are from a low yoga if
you are not familiar with a low yoga
they have a really nice quality workout
where and I own quite a few items from
them so these are a pair of cropped
leggings they're gray they have this
orange stripe on the side and then also
the pink down here and the pink is a
little bit more on the mesh side as well
and then it's the same thing on both
sides this isn't high waisted either and
again I just kind of prefer high waisted
even with my workout clothes because
with my leggings I still wear them out
because that's how I roll so I would
prefer something a little bit more high
waisted but
I've also just have these for a really
long time and I have a lot of other new
leggings like I said I mean you can see
that my dresser drawer won't close so
sad so I just knew it was time to get
rid of these but again these ones are
from ala yoga they are cropped I did cut
the tag off but these are also a size
small next up I have another pair of
cropped leggings and these ones are my
hand as soon as I put them on I was like
do I really want to get rid of these but
again I know I have a bunch of new
leggings I need to say goodbye to some
but these are from Victoria's Secret and
they are high-waisted you can see that
they go up really high so these are high
waisted leggings and they are kind of
like the ombre effect they're a really
bright pink up top and then they fade it
to kind of like an orange right here and
then they fade to a lighter pink after
the knees so these are what these
leggings look like I really do enjoy
these ones I think that they're very
comfortable I like that they are
high-waisted but I just need to be
making room for some of my newer items
in my collection so this pink ombre
cropped pair from a Victoria Secret will
also be going up on my Poshmark closet
the last pair of leggings that I have to
show these are from adore me I really
like the adore me athletic wear I have
quite a bit from them but this is
probably like one of my least favorite
pair of leggings just kind of how they
look on me I really like the floral
detail on the side and I love the kind
of crisscross here but it kind of ends
in like an awkward spot so like
sometimes if I wear these out and I wear
boots like the boots either don't go
high though for kinda looks a little
strange to me in the summer I can get
away with them more but then I also wear
cropped leggings in the summer more so I
don't know they just weren't my absolute
favorite pair they are high-waisted
again and I do find them to be really
comfortable and they feel really they
feel really nice they feel really nice
and high-quality like I said I do have
quite a bit from a dorm a star I also
believe a size small and just for a
reference I am about 5 5 in case anyone
is wondering about height but these ones
are from adore me will also be going up
on my closet alright so that's it for
the legging so I'll have a few more
bottoms that I'll put on Poshmark that's
everything I'm going to show for the
video so I'm gonna move on to sports
bras so I mean if this parts gonna make
you uncomfortable you don't have to
watch but I do have quite a few sports
bras and I've got a nail
lot more lately that I just need to get
rid of some this one is from Victoria
Secret it's part of the vsx line I
really liked this line and I feel like
these are really good quality a sports
bras I have one in another color as well
it does have a zip right here then the
back is a little bit hard to show but it
is a racerback but again if you do a lot
of like cardio or running are things
like that like this sports bra is going
to hold you in place which i think is
awesome so I really do like this one it
has the nice thick straps and it's kind
of like a green color again from the
Victoria Secret vsx line I'll have the
sizes listed on my Poshmark because I
didn't check before I put this one on
but this is the first sports bra that I
will be adding into the closet so I have
another one that's really similar to
this one just the back is a little bit
different it's still at the racerback
but it has thinner straps at the top and
then these straps are a little bit
different as well but same concept here
and again it really holds everything in
and it does have the zipper detail here
as well as the size on this one and this
one is a 32d so this is the next sports
bra that I will be adding to my closet
next up I have another one from
Victoria's Secret if you can tell I
purchased most of my workout wear from a
Victoria Secret this one is actually a
glow-in-the-dark sports bra so if your
gym turns into a dance club you will
have a glow-in-the-dark sports bra this
is also from the VF vsx line and again
it's soup like these brawls I just feel
like are so helpful for when doing
cardio and things like that running
anything it really does hold you in
place and this one I did cut the tag off
but I'm gonna go ahead and assume it is
a 32d like if you absolutely have to be
for short on the sizing I will have to
make a note that the tag is cut off but
I wear a 32d and I typically buy a 32d
in sports bras so I'm gonna go ahead and
say that this one is probably a 32d as
well really similar to the first a
sports bra that I showed it is a
racerback with a little hole cut out as
well but this one just fits really nice
so this one from a vsx is the next
sports bra that I'm saying goodbye to oh
she's so cute though it's a bit still
very similar in style this is AVS exit
bra from a Victoria's Secret
the size it is a 32d so it's this really
cool kind of like a turquoise color it
has some purple on here as well but
there is this kind of netting over it
but you can see I did rip it here so I
mean it's kind of in the shape of a
heart so that's cute and stuff honestly
it doesn't bother me and I ripped it
almost immediately I really don't even
know what happened but it ripped almost
immediately when I got it and I still
continue to wear it I do work out from
home so even if I am taking my shirt off
when I work out this doesn't bother me
at all so I continue to wear it but
again really thick straps here does a
really good job of holding everything
into the racerback as well and then it
does have a clasp kind of like a regular
bra clasp in the back also so this next
one from Victoria's Secret the bsx I
just got to make room for my other
sports bras that I just got but I really
like this one I think it's really cute
and I do like the colors but it's time
to say goodbye the last item that I'm
going to show for this video is this a
sports bra that's also from a Victoria's
Secret it says Happy Holidays on it I
know I know too funny Clinton is a
little bit more on at the regular side
it doesn't have any sort of like
underwire or support or anything in
there so I just need something a little
bit more in my sports bra so this one
just kind of does not work for me for
the actual purpose of a sports bra it's
fine if I'm just like lounging around
and whatever but I definitely cannot
wear this when working out and even
though I thought it was cute and funny
again I don't really I'm not like going
anywhere where people are reading my
sports bra okay so I figure I can go
ahead and get this one out of my
collection and make a room offer a few
more but if you don't mind something
that's not very supportive or you just
want something like cute and funny
this one Happy Holidays it is also from
a Victoria's Secret sure that that's
gonna be the last item that I am sharing
for this Poshmark declutter I'm coming
for the rest of you drawer so I'm coming
for you okay so that's gonna be
everything for this video change back
into my regular clothes here I hope that
you guys like the style of video I know
it was different but I'm always trying
to come up with different ways to do
videos and like I said when I saw Jackie
I need to do it this way I thought that
was a good idea and I thought maybe I
could do mine a little more like vlog
style so I don't know you guys can let
me know what you think about it but I
gotta thank you too Poshmark for working
with me on this video Michael
that link will be down below and all of
that other information will be down
there I think it's a really cool place I
utilize it as a seller a ton I have so
much on my closet and it's really
helpful for me especially when it does
come to decluttering it's really nice to
be able to do this especially because in
the wintertime we don't do garage sales
in Iowa does anybody else do you do
garage sales where you live we typically
have to wait till spring/summer to do
them so in the wintertime this is a
really good option for me that's going
to do it for today's video I hope that
you guys enjoyed it a little bit
different but let me know what you think
of it and if you'd want to see more
clothing to clutters if you like the
style of video please do just let me
know but as always if you guys did enjoy
this one or you found it helpful I hope
that you'll give it a thumbs up I hope
that you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I'll get you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
