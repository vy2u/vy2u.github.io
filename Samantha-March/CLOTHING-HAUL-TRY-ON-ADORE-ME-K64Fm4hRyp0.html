today's video is going to be a clothing
haul and Tryon video and this is
featuring all items from adore me so I
have talked about adore me in two
previous videos and I just got a third
order from them now this is not a
sponsored video and adore me did not ask
me to make this video but they have sent
me all three of my packages the first
time that adore me reached out to me it
was because they were just launching and
athletic line I was super excited about
that because I work out every day I like
living my workout clothes so I was able
to get a couple outfits from them and I
featured them a while back I mean that
might have been in like September or
October maybe and then they reached out
maybe just over a month ago and asked if
I wanted to have another package and you
know maybe future some other clothes at
my videos and I did talk about that in
one of my previous PR hauls I had three
different body suits that I got from
them and then they just asked me again
if I was like to have another package
from them and maybe mention some of
their clothes so I decided that I wanted
to do more of a haul and try on video
the past few times that I have talked
about their clothes I've just kind of
like held them up and showed you guys
and insert some pictures so what I
decided to do is feature the most recent
package that I just got from them today
doesn't filming this video I wanted to
feature the body suits that I got from
last time as well because again I was
just like holding them up and I didn't
really have a lot of pictures of me in
them yet the athletic wear that I did I
have like my yoga photo so I insert it
in here also so if you don't follow me
on snapchat I share a lot of my workouts
in some competition or like the photos
that I take and stuff like that too so
I'm stamping that March on snapchat if
you'd want to follow me over there for
some fitness stuff as well but those are
what I'm going to be showing you in
today's video now warning my style can
be a little bit on the sassy side so if
you don't want to see things like that I
would recommend closing out this video
if you don't want to see cleavage I'd
recommend cleaning out of this video so
I do try on the body suits but I do have
leggings on with them because the body
suits are very very cheeky and I just
think we needed to go down part of this
video but I wanted to warn you
that's just kind of what my personal
style is I do somebody suits I have some
athletic wear and then like pajama type
of things to show you as well and some
accessories also but if you would like
to see my clothing haul in China
featuring adore me please keep watching
so I'll make the adore me website linked
down below they do have a regular
membership and then a VIP membership
that if you're interested in joining you
could just get what you want to purchase
at a deeper discounts but you don't have
to be a member to sign up with them and
then just if you wanted to buy any of
this or anything that you see online you
would just pay for its full price versus
up a discounted membership price but
I'll leave that information listed in
the description box down below but the
first item that I had is this body suit
so this is like a really pretty like
light light purple bodysuit it has an
all lace front and then it does have
little cap sleeves here and the neck
does come up pretty high you'll see when
I'm doing the Tryon and in the back it
does have a little button here and then
as I'm actually trying them on and turns
them on a load in my house I do need so
much actually button and on button dues
for me so be rewarding that that's also
and there and then so it is the body
suit and they do have snaps here as well
all through the body suits that I got
does have those snaps which is really
helpful especially wouldn't like go into
the bathroom so you don't have to take
the entire body suit off to go to the
bathroom but this material right here is
very like very slinky and smooth I love
the color i think it's self feminine I
love all the lace up here it does dip
down really low so there is a lot of
cleavage with it but again that's like
my personal style the body suit I think
are actually listed under lingerie on
the website I think I'm saying that
correctly but I would wear all three of
these bodysuits out because again that's
just my style
so throw on that out there but I
wouldn't wear them like alone and I
wouldn't even wear them what like tights
and try to be like Beyonce over I carry
I would wear them with leggings or
high-waisted jeans no matter what so I'm
not gonna be walking around with body
suits like I do have confidence but I
don't have that
confidence but yeah this is the first
bodysuit and then the next year that I
have are both black as I was taking out
the bodysuit I remember I picked out
these two and then I have a third black
one I was like maybe I should go with
something with a little bit of color but
you can tell I do love black so this one
is probably the sauciest bodysuit that
you're going to see so this is what this
one looks like so it does have cutouts
on the side here and then the top is all
lace as well I wear this with a black
box I just feel like it fits in really
well I just have the same bra on the
whole time with the purple one I
wouldn't wear a black bra with I would
wear I have like almost that exact color
bodysuit I have that in a bra so that's
what I would wear but in the interest of
saving time I wore the same bra
throughout and then like I said the
front is pretty sheer and it does dip
down really low but then it has like
some coverings here for the breast area
which is good and then the back is
pretty fun it's very very cut out very
sheer like the sides are completely cut
out so this is definitely a softer
bodysuit again probably fine for the
bedroom but again I would wear it out
with like the leggings I wore the video
have like sheer panels in them I would
wear it with that or even like really
dark high-waisted jeans or like black
jeans I would wear the side to probably
not in Iowa where I live but this would
be like a good like Vegas outfit type of
thing but yes this was the next bodysuit
so the next product I have is what I
think is my favorite so it is actually
long sleeves and the sleeves are sheer
so again it's pretty much all sheer and
then in the stomach it has like some
lace detail which i think is really
really cool but again I would just wear
a black bra with this and actually this
it does have the button in the back as
well and then the snaps on the bottom
too like I said each of the body suits
to help the snap this one I just really
like I just find it super feminine like
I know it's really really sheer is
what's wrong and I get it but
I like it and that's my type of style
but I think look like the long sleeves
even though those are sheer like I just
feel like they add something to it and
this is definitely my favorite one I
like these a lot
you know these definitely probably or
not for everybody
you know not everybody will want to like
wear them out like I would want to but
that's my style so that's what I wanted
to do but yeah this one is probably my
favorite bodysuit I just really like it
I like how it fits I did get all three
bunny suits in an extra small I had saw
someone on the website say like there
were five six and I think they put like
what gene size they usually wear maybe
and they said that they were an extra
spawn that worked out really well for
them and I'm only five five I was
thinking about getting a small but
myself that they said they were five six
I was like I'm not super familiar with
bodysuit so I'm just going to go up that
recommendation so I got extra smalls in
all of them and I probably would have
been fine with the small they're just
like when I try to pull them up enough
to like cover my bra in the front I just
feel like I'm giving myself a huge
wedgie so probably smalls would have
been fine and then they are a little
tight in the chest
I am a 32d so they're little pain in the
chest so I think I could have gotten
away with a small instead of an extra
small so if I order more body suits from
them I would definitely order the small
like I said on five five till you wear
like a size two pants and then just like
small tops so put some idea of some of
my sizes but yeah those were the body
suits and I've been really happy with
all of them and then moving on to my
most recent order so I did like the
athletic wear the first time and then I
did the body suits the second time and I
tried to do like a variety this time so
I did get some sleep wear from them this
is called the Primrose and think it is
like I said everything will be linked
down below but it's just some pretty
black sleepwear of course it has some
sheer panels on the sides as well and it
has some lace detail on the bottom it's
pretty short it's not like super super
short but it was still short enough that
I didn't show the whole length and I was
doing the Tryon but it's not like it
just hits right at the booty or anything
it is a little bit longer than that
but still it's pretty short did like at
the top I just thought again it was
really pretty and feminine it rented me
a lot of the top of the second body suit
that I showed so I think it would just
be really comfortable sleep where I
wouldn't go out in this it looks more
like a dress but it's not something that
I would go out in but I would definitely
sleep in this or like we're going on
vacation somewhere or something like
that I would bring this to sleep in it's
really comfortable it's also really soft
they're really feminine and girly at the
same time so I really like that
yeah this one in a size small and I
think that it's a really really well the
next item I got I had to go back with
some athletic wear I really really like
the adore me leggings I like leggings
that I can not only workout in but I can
also go out in and the last two leggings
that I got from them were just like fun
like one word navy blue with sheer
panels and one was black and it had cut
out along the legs and I really liked
them I went out with them I thought they
were great so I decided to get another
pair as well because I really did like
them so these are just a pair of grey
leggings and then they also have some
black lace detail at the bottom of the
leggings these are super comfortable
very easy to work out in again I got us
a small and I think that they said
really well I like the lace detail at
the bottom I would totally go out in
these as well like maybe not just
somewhere like super fancy but just like
going out for a while like I would go
out in these and like flip-flops or
something that wouldn't bother me at all
again just super comfortable it was kind
of harder to show the lace detail when I
was doing the Tryon but so you can see
here how much lace they have and what it
looks like and then it does go all the
way around too so you can see that and
then it also came with a matching top so
the athletic wear typically will always
come in a set you can choose different
sizes so maybe you're a small chocolate
a large bottom or whatever you can mix
and match your sizes but they completely
all do come with the top this one came
with a pink top some of them come with a
t-shirt some of them come with a sports
bra but they are mostly all in sets so
this is the king cap that it came with
and again it just matches the same
colored gray and then the lace detail on
top and then this is what the back looks
like so this is an athletic wear shirt
in the training video I do still have
one like my regular bra but typically I
would wear a sports bra with this one
again I got the size small fit really
well
super comfortable it's very like
breathable it's not like tight or
anything like that so when I work out I
don't think that it would bother me I
haven't worked out in them yes because I
just got them I was wearing the leggings
around the house almost the whole day
and I was just going to wear them for
the video but I thought no I should hold
them up and show you especially at the
lace part which I didn't feel like I got
him to try on very well but they were
super comfortable and again I think the
tab will be fine to work out in I might
even wear this out sometime I don't know
I might do it I might do it I have a
very athletic style as well so there's a
lot of times where you catch me out and
about in my yoga pants and I don't
apologize for it because I like to be
comfortable but that was the isolate
this is called the Alice set I'll leave
a link down below as well but I really
like this I really really do like the
adore me likings like if I had to
recommend one thing to like everybody
from the adore me line it would be the
athletic wear and especially the legging
well the last clothing out in my badge
I'm actually still wearing it it's just
a simple black top it is long sleeves
but then the back is kind of cool
it has a very deep cut out in the back
and then it ties in a ribbon as you can
see in here it just has like the ribbon
on top it's like a lilac type of ribbon
I really like it this was under their
sleepwear and then because it does come
in the set as well it came with a like
little pair of shorts they were a little
bit too cheeky for me to put on in the
video
paid I'd be like what we call top pants
back in my cheerleading days what we
would wear underneath our cheerleading
skirts but these are really nice to have
around the house for like loungewear
comfortable wear that sort of thing I'm
not going to wear these out because
that's not where I have my body
confidence in is my booty and my legs
so I just really like the top it's super
comfortable like very very soft it kind
of has the material that I was afraid it
was going to pick up a lot my dog
doesn't really shed but everyone smile
like her hair
fly around and I've been wearing this
most of the day as well and like she's
been up close to me and her hair has not
been speaking to it so really grateful
for that because you know it's kind of
when you feel some materials you're like
oh that could like pick up everything it
hasn't it's super comfortable like I
said it's long sleeves I love the back
detail I love the bow I thought it was
super cute so I was really excited about
this set I was looking at the website it
does say it sold out at the time that
I'm filming I hope that it's going to
come back because I just thought it was
so adorable and cute so fingers crossed
that it well but I'll have the
information listed down below and maybe
they will come back with this one
because clearly it was a pretty hot item
okay and then the last thing that I have
to share are accessories so I didn't
even realize the first times that I
ordered from them that I had accessories
or maybe they're new and I just now
stumbled upon them on the third time but
I was super excited to see these so I
got chokers and I got a bunch of
earrings so this does come in one set I
believe is called the Dixie set I think
the regular price for non-members is
like $40 and you get one two three four
five chokers and two four six sets of
earrings I think that's a really good
price so one of the chokers I'm wearing
right now and I'm not going to lie like
I am super excited about this one I just
put it on and I'm already in love with
it and I know that you're going to be
seeing me a lot in it so it also has
another black one that has this cool
design here two gold ones and then this
one is a gold one with some white detail
as well as kind of like a white gray
detail and then the earrings I do have a
one set and they're just really simple
gold studs like that's like I'm pretty
simple when it comes to my earrings but
some of these can kind of get me out of
my comfort zone as well but these are
what the earrings look like so we just
have like some more regular studs but
then we have like funner ones like I
don't have anything like these these are
kind of fun too these are mine me did
anybody watch the charms back in the day
I don't know why but when I saw those
earrings sounds like charms they
reminded me of the charm symbol I don't
have a ton of earrings like I don't buy
myself jewelry a lot so a lot of times
you see me in my videos without earrings
or like I've been wearing chokers more
lately but I don't
really have a lot of earrings so I
thought this could help step up my
earring game but honestly what I was
most excited about was definitely just
five chokers and I love this one so much
I can't wait to test out these other
ones I was really excited about the
accessories had the tooth out a lot for
a really good price so I was pumped to
see that they also have swimwear in
there too I have bras and panties they
have lingerie
like I said bodysuit save hosiery the
athletic wear accessories they have
pretty much anything that you need and
so again always I'll list everything
down below the membership details and
all that I'll link everything that I
talked about as well but I just thought
it would be really nice I've been really
grateful to adorn me that they've sent
me 3 packages now and I thought it would
be just be kind of cool to do a clothing
haul and try on I want to start doing
more fashion videos on my panel anyways

stuff opened up I'm working with her as
