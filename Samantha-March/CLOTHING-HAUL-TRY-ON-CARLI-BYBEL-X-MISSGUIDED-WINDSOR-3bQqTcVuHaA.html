today's video I have a little bonus a
Saturday a video for you it's going to
be a clothing haul and try on video so I
recently picked up a few items from both
Windsor store and also the Carli bybel a
misguided collection so I'll show you
all of the pieces that I picked out let
you know what I think of them how they
fit all that fun stuff
and then I will also insert some trend
clubs so you can see what they actually
look like on me this is not a sponsored
video and no one sent me any of these
products I did purchase all of them with
my own money because I'm excited to show
you what I got one thing if you have
never seen my clothing hauls in the past
I describe my style as saucy so if you
do not like that type of style and you
do not like cleavage this is my
suggestion to you to click out of this
video so fair warning but why don't I go
ahead and jump into it where we get
started let's just let's just take a
look at the shirt I'm wearing now
because I might come on now it says I
love my Vizsla with a picture of a bee
on it if you guys do not know my dog
Aires she is a Vizsla and she's
basically like the love of my life my
best friend I love my dog so much my
friend Candace sent me this shirt and I
was immediately like I'm going to wear
this every single day so so I had to get
that out of the way first but to get
into the clothing haul the first time
I'm going to talk about is a Windsor
store no I found Windsor store was I've
seen some other youtubers like desi and
Katy I love Sarah E I believe they have
done outlook books featuring a Windsor
store and I've just seen you know them
on Instagram posting OoT D's and hanging
winter store quite a bit in there so I
went to check out their website and I
immediately was very impressed filled
like a comparison I would compare it to
like a fashion Nova they have a lot of
different choices in there and a lot of
like the trendy pieces I would say but I
did also think a lot of it was very
affordable which is fantastic I picked
up four different pieces from there so
the first one is this a bodysuit which I
just think is the cutest thing on the
first night that I got on the Windsor
website this immediately stuck out to me
and I was like I have to have this not
only because I love body suits but I'm
kind of obsessed with them these days
but this color is like everything to me
I love this color this is called the
basic of the body suit it's in the color
rust I got mine as
small and it is and $19.90 which I don't
think is bad at all so it has the short
sleeves it dips it very low in the front
and then it also does have the snaps on
the bottom which are so important for
body suits seriously I don't understand
body suits that don't have snaps can I
understand it so it does have the snaps
and you'll be able to see in the try on
haul that is very form-fitting to me it
fits like a glove and I appreciate that
I think it looks really good was
high-waisted jeans like I'm wearing in
the Tryon clips and I like the minute I
put it on I was like yes I cannot wait
to wear this if you do have boobs I mean
you're probably going to show a lot of
cleavage because of how far it dips and
how how well it fits like I want to say
it's tight but for me it's not like
super overly tight I can still breathe
in it and all of that fun stuff so I
enjoyed my size and I like the way that
it looks on me they did have quite a few
other body suits on the website but I
wanted to just order this one because I
wasn't sure of the sizing yet for a
Windsor store because I've never ordered
from them I am typically a size small
sometimes an extra small for certain
brands or certain websites but I feel
like this one with everything that I've
tried I feel like they're pretty darn
true to size so the small worked well
for me and if you don't like clothes to
be as tight as form-fitting and maybe if
you're in between sizes I would say a
size up but this one from the moment I
put it on and us going to be in love
with it I would definitely get more body
suits I feel like they're just such a
staple like it's just such a classic top
I really enjoyed it for only $20 I
didn't think that was bad at all
so next up I have this crap top and this
is what it looks like it is a black with
some flower designs on it it is a
long-sleeved and then it also ties like
underneath the chest area you can tie it
up this is called the pretty girl crop
top in black and the price was 20 to 90
again I got mine in a small I really
like the way that this one looked too
and I liked the contrast between the
long sleeves but then also the crop top
at the same time and enjoy that when you
tie it those ties are pretty along times
but those ties being so long you can
kind of help
her up the stomach in case tear maybe
not feeling super-confident but you
still want to rock of crap top I don't
know I felt like I died those ties it
being as long as they were but I thought
this one was really cute on to I enjoyed
the long sleeves when I first pulled it
out I wasn't sure cuz I was like I don't
know what these flowers kind of like
older like more mature style looking I'm
not a hundred percent on that but I
actually really enjoyed the way that it
looked I can see myself wearing this to
concerts I go to quite a few concerts so
I can see myself wearing that there
because especially in the wintertime I
would still have long sleeves but I
still wouldn't be super hot it's a crop
top and I can tell that the fabric is
very breathable fabric which I enjoy so
again I got mine in a size small it is
$22.90 and I really like this one too
next up I have a gray cropped sweatshirt
so this is what it looks like so it is a
crop and then I loved the sleeves cuz
they're kind of like bunchy sleeves I
thought that was super cute I didn't get
mine in a size extra small it was 24.90
but it was on sale for $19 when I picked
it up I just thought it didn't really
say anything about it being oversized
but just kind of like looking at the
photos I thought maybe it would be kind
of bigger especially because the sleeves
are you know kind of different so that's
why I want that extra small and I think
it fits it really well I do think the
small maybe could have been a little bit
too big on me but I really like it I
enjoy that it's long sleeve but a crop
again I just like the contrast of that
and I feel like it kind of makes it more
wearable in the winter time when like I
want to go out but I don't want to be
freezing cold but I don't want to be
super hot when I go out I feel like I
like that contrast and also it's not
really tight at the bottom here it's
more of a looser fit which that can be
really nice too in crop tops I tend to
gravitate towards them also and I feel
like it can also kind of give an
illusion of you having a smaller waist
when you have more of a baggy fit crop
top so that's kind of where I go for
those sometimes as well so I really
enjoyed the way that it fit and I also
did think it was super cropped either
especially if you wear like high whisset
leggings or high waisted jeans the high
waist with a longer crop top can make it
look maybe not quite as like you know
you're wearing a shirt
that goes right underneath your chest so
I really enjoyed it I liked the fabric
on this too it's really like comfy and
cozy I love the color grey is one of my
favorite colors and I don't like to
where to put my opposite I mean I just
love the color gray so I am super happy
with this sweatshirt again it was only
$19 I thought that was a huge steal so
really happy with this one and the final
item that I picked up from Windsor store
is a pair of leggings they are olive
leggings and they have little like rips
and kind of tears in them along the leg
and then they also have some like in the
hip area as well you'll probably be able
to see a little bit more in the Tryon
clip too but these are called the fatal
attraction of leggings and the color I
picked up is olive of course one of my
favorites it's $25.90 arjen seriously
yes I put on my snapchat are these my
new favorite leggings duh the olive the
rips I love the ripped style they're not
super high waisted they do have any
thicker wasting in which I appreciate I
don't feel like they're traditional high
waisted but they're not like a low-rise
maybe I would say mid rise mid to high
rises what I would say so I just think
they are so comfy they're so soft I
actually had them on before I was
filming this and I was like wait where I
know I got four pieces from winter storm
like oh yes yes yes I'm wearing the
leggings that's my bad so I am really
really happy with these they go all the
way down to my ankles a very comfortable
very cute
I love them overall I am super happy
with everything that I ordered from
winter store I think the sizing is very
true to size I'm happy with all of my
pieces like honestly if I had to pick a
favorite piece I don't know if I could I
love that body suit the gray sweater is
so cute I'm gonna wear these all the
time and I love that black crop top
before like going out events so I don't
know if I could pick a favorite only
downfall I would say is that I feel like
it took a quite a few days to get to me
I think it almost took a full seven days
I wish I would have wrote down the dates
I need to remember to do that when I did
the clothing hauls but I feel like it
took almost like six to seven days to
get to me which was a long time but I
believe I also did have
shipping so fee you can pay for faster
shipping you could get it that way that
would really be my only downfall
otherwise I was super happy with it I
like to the website I thought the prices
were good too I love the pieces on there
I will definitely be purchasing more
from Windsor store very happy with it
so that's everything I got it from there
and then why don't we move over to what
I got from the misguided and Carli bybel
collection so I didn't mention this and
I pass it will I buy a video but Carli
bybel is one of my favorite youtubers
she's the very first a youtuber that I
ever started watching she did a
collaboration with misguided I think it
was a last year I purchased a couple
pieces and I really did enjoy it I got
very excited when I saw that she was
racing a new collection I will have
everything that I'm talking about of
course linked it down below but I did
notice there is still quite a few items
are that are available for this
collection and she's also doing a second
job with misguided that will be coming
sometime in November I don't think we
have the exact date yet but I will be
watching for that as well I'm just very
excited to support a youtuber and I was
excited over if you had the pieces that
I saw so I just picked up a three pieces
from this collection at this time so I
will show you guys yeah so the first
item that immediately caught my
attention before Carly even had her
video out about it I saw her wearing
these on Instagram and I was like I'm
going to need those so these are a pair
of nude high waisted leggings they are
called the nude ribbed high waist
leggings they were $25 and I love the
nude color I thought that was so cute I
thought it would be really cute to pair
them with and like a pair of nude pumps
I got mine in a size two and I think I
could have done a zero big on me but not
so much like in the waist but they're
incredibly long I'm not super tall I'm
about five five I'm more legs than I am
torso that's where my height comes from
but it still somehow these were like way
too long on me and it was kind of like
the problem was like the crotch area is
would go like really far down unless I
pulled them really high up but I can
pull these all the way up to my boobs
which I don't really need to pull my
leggings up that far and then it would
kind of make the
crotch area look okay but otherwise it
just is it's almost like if they're just
too much like they're too long so I'm
not have to present yet if I'm going in
to keep these and really I don't know if
a size zero would have made that much of
a difference so I would say to maybe a
size down from misguided because I
definitely could have done a zero on
seeing if they would have helped it all
I mean I do like that they're
high-waisted but it's almost like they
have to be too high way set to get
everything else to look right and if I
have them where I would actually wear a
high-waisted jeans like if I was gonna
wear these out with a crop top I
wouldn't want them pulled all the way up
to my boobs like if I was wearing a
longer sweater or just a longer shirt in
general it wouldn't be as big of a deal
but if I'm gonna wear it with a crop top
then I don't know it would look a little
funny because if I put it down to where
I want it to be then it's just kind of
like baggy and bunched up weird in other
areas so I don't know that's kind of a
bummer about that I will say that it
also definitely shows like panty lines
I've tried this with a couple different
pairs of underwear and I've just decided
that you can't wear underwear with these
because no matter what you were able to
see like not see through them like
they're sheer but you can see the actual
lines of your underwear which was a kind
of a bummer but again if you wear
something longer it's not gonna be that
big of a deal but I'm not sure you can
let me know what you think in the try on
clips which think of them and if you
think I should keep them I really like
the quality though they feel like really
nice quality I love the color I love all
of that I just wish that they fit a
little bit better and you know maybe
didn't show the underwear lines as much
but I didn't think $25 was a bad price I
feel like miss Qaeda is you know fairly
affordable as well even doing a
collaboration with Carli bybel I don't
think $25 for a pair of like nice like
quality leggings is bad because I pay a
lot of money for my leggings because
that's what I wear the most I know you
can give me your feedback what you think
of these I'm just I'm not a hundred
percent sure yep I'll keep them that I
got is a gray cropped hoodie I
personally find it to be more blue than
anything I think that happened when she
did her last collaboration she had a
blue - pate - piece in there but it was
called grey but I was like now this is
definitely blue to me this is blue but
like a bluegray more blue and this is
called the gray cropped hoodie it's all
it's called it was $30 and I got mine in
a size two again I really like the way
that this one fits fairly I do like this
one a lot of the hemline is the raw cut
and then the top goes up nice in along
if you can see in the Tryon clips but
again I love the long sleeves contrast
it with the crop top and this is kind of
like the gray one from Windsor store
where it's not super tight so it can
kind of help give you that illusion of
the smaller waist as well but I love the
color the inside is so like soft and
cozy I just enjoy this as so much ease
with like high-waisted jeans are the
highway set leggings I think would look
really well too but I love how
comfortable it is I love the color I
love the crop top um I kind of do like
that raw detail from the hemline I think
it is pretty cool this is definitely my
favorite piece that I got from the
collection I'm really happy with this
one and I will definitely be keeping it
so the final piece of that I've got is
called the nude oversized sweater dress
so this is what it looks like again I
love the color and it's definitely
oversized
and sweater dress it has it long sleeves
I got Miami size - I definitely should
have gotten it in its 0 but when I saw
oversized that to me I should have known
to get a zero I wasn't thinking it
released it like seven eight on my time
and I just went in it was like boom boom
boom order to everything on size - and
was done with it but I definitely
could've should've ordered this one in a
zero as well because it's just a little
bit too big on me like lengthwise and I
think what's kind of bothering me is
that on the bottom here there's like you
know these extra inches of fabric right
here what I do when I've been trying it
on is I've been tucking that under and I
feel like I I think I remembered to show
both ways in the Tran clip but I've been
tucking it under and I like that a lot
more so I don't know if I should just
pin it I don't know I don't know what
I'm gonna do yet let me know what you
think about this one it's this one too
and the in the Tryon clips and if you
think I should keep it or what I should
do with it sweater dresses definitely
look good with like knee-high boots or
thigh high boots or something like that
so I do have my boots on and the try
clips you can see what the outfit
actually looks like because definitely
without having the shoes on this just
looked kind of like potato sack II on me
that word I just looked a little bit too
oversized and too big I do like the
fabric inside it's very you know it's
similar to the blue one it's very comfy
and cozy inside and I do like that it's
oversized I do just wish I would have
gotten the size zero to have it fit a
little bit better I love the color I
love the nude I was wearing this the
other day in the wilayat video as I was
walking around my house in the boots
trying to decide should I keep it or not
I still have yet to decide so help me
out because it was $40 so I don't know
if I should try to return it or if I
should try to get the size zero I'm not
a hundred percent yet but I don't know I
like everything about it except that
it's just a little bit too big on me so
this one I am not a hundred percent on
either so let me know what you think I
would say with misguided I ordered from
them the last time and I didn't really
have any issues of sizing wise but that
might have been because I ordered like a
jacket so like sizing there wasn't too
bad I know that I ordered tops like I
just I don't remember having sizing
issues and I feel like I'm having a lot
of sizing issues here I don't feel like
I've shrunk from the last year maybe I
have those are the three items that I
got from the Carli bybel collection let
me know what you think when you see the
Tron Clips let me know what you think
about the leggings and then the
oversized sweater any suggestions you
might have or you think I should keep
them or return them do let me know
