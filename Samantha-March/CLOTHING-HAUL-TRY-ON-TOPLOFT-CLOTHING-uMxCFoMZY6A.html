today's video is going to be a new
clothing haul and try on video I'm super
excited for this video because I'm
featuring all pieces from top off
clothing I have talked about pop off on
youtube before and then ultimate other
social media accounts but if you are new
here or you don't know yet top off
clothing was started by my sister-in-law
step and I recently started working with
her in my online marketing influencer
marketing type of department so that has
been very exciting and a lot of fun to
you know just learn something new and be
a part of something new I been having a
lot of fun doing it so I dis place an
order recently on the top lock website
i'm going to show you everything that i
got and then i also include some clips
is me actually trying everything on I do
have a discount code with tab walk
clothing it's just Samantha and you'll
get fifteen percent off so i'll leave
that listed in the description box down
below i always do like full disclaimer
in my video this video is not sponsored
this isn't paying me to make this video
and i did purchase everything myself
nothing was sent to me but I do get an
employee discount so I did buy
everything but I do get a discount for
working with the store so just so you
guys know I love Eve top less clothing
obviously the website will be down below
I'll link to all the pieces that I'm
talking about and then I'll also leave
the social medias a lot of times it's me
on the social media accounts as well so
sometimes you're chatting with me over
there but I will leave it to all listed
down below but basically just have less
clothing across the board right now a
chop block is only shipping to the US
but I know that stuff is working on
expanding that so that's really exciting
definitely follow on the social media
and you know you guys will be the first
one to know when we have more shipping
options available and there is free
shipping on orders over $25 and it is
like the two-day priority shipping so
you get it really fast which is awesome
and then tap off has a little bit of
everything you know tops and bottoms
with and also shoes handbags jewelry
accessories everything like that so I'm
excited to share with you what I got if
you guys can't tell I'm very sick as
soon as i get done filling this video
the hair extensions are coming out
eyelashes are coming off
going to bed I am super sick but I
wanted to get this video films I don't
think there's anything else and I have
to say about top lock if there's any
questions you can always ask me or just
ask through the top wall social media
and one of us will always get back to
you so yeah I think that's all that I
have to say I'm really excited to be
doing this video I'm really been loving
the work that I'm doing with top Lofton
obviously i love my sister-in-law very
much and I'm super grateful that she
gave me the opportunity to be able to
work with her in a different type of
setting and it's been a lot of fun it's
been a lot of fun so far I've been
enjoying it but why don't we go ahead
and jump into everything that I picked
up so the first thing that I got is a
t-shirt and like the moment that I saw
this come online I was like yeah
obviously I need this so it's just a
basic grey tea but it says running on
caffeine and dry shampoo and like I
don't know if anything could sum me up
better it was basically my life I just
thought it was so cute I'm a really big
fan of just like comfy casual t-shirt I
work from home so that's like what I'm
in the majority of the time I just like
to be comfortable but also going out
running errands even going to gym
whatever it is I feel like you can never
have to make t-shirts I'm that person
that still has teachers from my high
school days anybody else cuz i do I now
also have like when my husband tries to
get rid of his t-shirts I'm like oh I'll
take them I'll wear them at the problem
but I thought this one was super cute
and just sold me this one is a $29 they
do run a little bit on the big size so i
got mine in a size small and i can tell
just a little bit roomier but i like
because it's longer and i just glue or
lightnings a lot so it's a little bit
longer and just fits a little bit looser
but it's not like loose and baggy if
that makes sense so I've been really
liking it I liked a little bit more of
the comfy sighs come beside and not like
quite so fit it in tight there's another
one that says running on diet coke and
dry shampoo which I thought was really
funny but I'm not add a coke cranker
much more just like coffee so I doesn't
sure it which is like perfect for me
I've been loving it so much I just think
it's so funny so will be linked down
below but I just love that shirt item I
picked up was a tank top so it's just an
army green tank top but then it has like
a fun design here so we have like the
black and then kind of like the class in
the front I just thought that was cool I
love the color I love like I was green
hunter green army green like I'm just
like 1ml about right now so when I saw
this top I just thought it was so cute
and I mean it would be good to wear
alone of course and like spring or
summer but even like now like wearing
just like putting a bomber jacket over
it or something I just think would be
super cute so I love it I got a size
small and I would say that it runs true
to size again it's a little bit on the
longer side which i prefer because I
wear leggings a lot so I think that is
great this one is $22 on the website but
again just like more of a kind of casual
pink top yet I felt like the design on
the front like give it a little bit of
it themselves yes really liking this one
as well the next I might have is
definitely one of my favorites this is
the Courtney top so this is just a gray
sweater but then it has the distress of
detailing all along it which I'm just
like obsessed with the distress right
now so it's just dressed all the way
down long sleeved it is more of like a
sweater material so it's a little bit
warmer I love this top again I got mine
in size small i would say it runs true
to size but again it is a little bit
longer I didn't think it was like super
tight fitting anywhere and so I think
the true to size would be okay but like
I said it is a little bit longer which I
prefer because i live in yoga leggings
but I just love this I think this is so
trendy and just so cute it's so
comfortable I've just been loving
wearing it I love all the distressed
detail on it I'm just loving this one
again this is the Courtney top and this
run is running for thirty-eight dollars
I was wearing it on my snapchat the
other day and asking so many questions
of what my top was and where it came
from but it is just the Courtney tub the
last item that I got in my order are
some moto leggings now i recommend the
Moto legging all of the time these are
what they look like I got mine in my
kind with the powder blue so they have
this texture kind of on the thigh area
and then they have
zipper at the ankles I love these
leggings because they are so comfortable
they have a stretchy waistband so lots
of stretch there's no button nose that
for subsonic you're wearing regular
jeans and it doesn't look like you're
wearing like just leggings either like
it's such a perfect in between I have
these in a love as well I picked him up
in blue there's also now like a really
pretty like pastel pink color on the
website to that I'm i am pretty hard as
well but i recommend these leggings all
the time just because they are so
comfortable I feel like they fit so well
I like them because I feel like they
actually like kind of making me look
like I have a booty cuz I don't really
have one but I shared my butt looks
nicer when I wear these liking I don't
know what it is but that's that's just
me again i would say they would run
pretty true to size I'm small and that's
what I got mine in and I don't have any
issues with them again I mean the way
sin is really really stretchy which is
definitely helpful so that's why I would
say that they run more true to size so
length they go like about to the ankle
and then you can zip lamar not with the
Engel zipper detail that it had but
that's about where the length falls
which for me I like but I love these
leggings I'm constantly recommending
them just some of my absolute favorites
and I love these blue ones I just think
they are so cute i love them i've been
wearing them so much as well these are
the Moto legging these are thirty-nine
dollars on the website and there's a lot
of different colors like i said there's
the blue there's the pink and then i'm
not sure what all is in stock right now
like i said i have olive ice cream coral
like black blue I mean there's just tons
of different colors on my yourself be
sure to check out the motor lanes ok so
that's everything that I picked up in my
online order that I just did but I have
two more items that I'm always
recommending from top lofts or just like
when I'm constantly wearing so i wanted
to throw them in here real quick to give
you guys some more ideas too so one is
just this lacy racerback bra less i love
these i know i've even features even
like favorite videos like when i first
picked these up they made it into a
favorites video that's how much make
surely love these this one is in blush
which i'm not sure this colors in stock
anymore but there's multiple colors on
the website and i also have mine in
royal blue these are twenty four dollars
and i really like to wear them if i'm
wearing anything even Mike
off the shoulder because then to have
this peeking through like being shown on
your shoulder instead of like a regular
bra strap I just think you look so much
better and I'm saying also super
comfortable there's no like padding or
anything to it so it's just no whining
or anything like that so it's just like
a very comfortable piece as well I like
practically live in these I mean it's I
wear them a lot I really like them I'm
glad that I got the two colors because
I'll wear one for a very long time and
then finally wash it and I'm like oh no
and all were the other wasn't so yeah
the lacy racerback bra let's are a
favorite of mine and then the other save
I have it's my little CC beanie so this
is the beanie with the pom-pom on top I
believe there are so also just like the
regular CC beanies online as well but
then there's also ones with the palm and
they also have these four kids as well I
think are still in fact how about also
does have top lost kid so if you do have
like little girls and I know I've even
seen like a little boy onesie they do
have a kid section so definitely check
that out stuff has three young daughters
for channel of fun shopping to the
little girl's clothes and those are for
three helpers they're on snapchat quite
a bit as well but I lovely pass I think
they are just like super fun or they
have fun and that one thing I really
like about these two that they are
actually warm when I bought this I was
like and you know it's probably just can
feel like my pretty head like if I'm
running somewhere too but I want my ears
covered but I'll just wear this but this
is actually really warm so if you live
in like clothes are things like I do I
live in Iowa I can actually wear this
when it's really cold outside and going
outside and it does keep my tears form
so this is just a big favor as well
again there's multiple colors these are
sixteen dollars i believe and then the
regular CC vini is 14 if you don't want
the palm on top but I'll leave these
link down below as well I just think
they are so cute and I've just been
wearing it non-stop so i just want to
mention these two favorites as well
because their favorites of mine and i'm
wearing them a ton and so i thought i
would throw these in here as well
