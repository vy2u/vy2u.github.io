hate is suffocating and always
hesitating kryptonite desires of my
heart of fire
thank you for watching so today's video
is going to be a clothing haul slash try
on so I don't you like clothing or
fashion videos a whole lot mostly
because I really don't go shopping a
whole lot like in these like big chunks
here that I can actually make a video
out of like I'm mostly just like pick up
pieces here and there if I need them
mostly because I work from home so I
don't have like the pressure of having
to wear something nice to work you know
that sort of thing I'm I just work from
home and I wear yoga pants most of the
time and I also like don't really go out
a whole ton so I'm just not really a
huge clothes shopper but usually at the
change of the seasons like it's a big
seasons like this like we're going from
summer to fall that is when I will try
to grab a few pieces to add into my
collection for the upcoming season so
that is exactly what I have recently
done I did pick up a few pieces from the
Carly Bible and misguided collection
when they did their relaunch the
original launch was such a crazy mess
that I ended up giving up but when they
did the relaunch I was able to get the
few pieces that I actually really want
it and then I do have quite a few
clothes to show you from a top up
clothing as well if you watch my channel
for a while or you follow me on snapchat
you would know that type of clothing is
a boutique that was started by my
sister-in-law stuff her off as an online
boutique only and she now has a physical
store as well in Carroll Iowa where she
lives and it's just where I shop out all
the time you know of course not only to
support family but I just truly love
what she brings in she is so trendy and
has such a good eye for fashion and the
styles what's on trend that I just I
love going there I love shopping online
I love the clothes that she gets in so I
have quite a few in here and then I also
did a Tryon as well as all insert clips
of me what the clothing actually on so
you can see what I think about them and
I will try to link everything down below
I know there are still some pieces from
from the Carly and misguided collection
that are still available so anything
that is I will link down below and like
with tabla I will link anything that I
can down
the boutique so it's you know changes
quite a bit but anything that I have in
here that I can find on the website I
will link down below so why don't we go
ahead and hop into the clothing hall
I've got is a top and it's like a tan
khaki color maybe call it and has the
pocket right here and it does have the
long sleeves and then they're kind of
like rolled up and buttoned at the end
but I liked it because it's just like
comfy and casual like you can wear it
around the house but you could also wear
it out you could wear it to work I did
get a size medium I tried on the small
first and I thought it was just a little
bit too like tight in certain areas so I
went with the medium and I thought it
worked out much better it is a
twenty-two dollars so again this is what
it looks like and then I will insert a
couple of clips in here as well thing
with tapleft that i wanted to let you
guys know i've been talking about chop
off a little bit more on my snapchat
especially when i'm wearing something
and people are asking me what I'm
wearing and then I'm showing you guys
top left and stuff said that she's been
seeing a lot of support from it which is
so cool so of course we both want to
thank you so much but she wanted to give
me a coupon code for my subscribers
which I thought was really amazing so if
you do purchase anything up from a top
off clothing you can use the code
Samantha and that will get you 15% off
your entire order and you also do get
free shipping on orders over $25 or more
so that's pretty cool
I'll leave my code down below as well
but it's just Samantha for 15% off so
thank you to stuff for doing that I
think that is really cool so I hope you
liked some of the pieces that I picked
up and I will leave tough block link
down below if you want to check out the
website as well but again this was the
first piece that I got just the
long-sleeve shirt I think perfect for
fall and then next I have his hair pants
that I'll show you that I actually
paired with this outfit like I put it on
together and I thought it was super cute
they went together really well and you
run with like boots in the scarf I think
would be a really pretty fall look so
these are the pants that I got they're
like an olive green color and I got a
size small and they are $39 so they have
this cool like textured pattern on like
the thigh area as well I like them
because they're stretchy like they don't
have a button they don't have a zip or
anything like that
they're just kind of like the stretchy
material which I thought was really cool
and really comfortable there is no
pockets so if you're someone who like
has to have pockets and their pants
these do not have front or back pockets
so I just wanna make you aware of that
but I thought the color was really cool
I like the like different detail here as
well and they ended up being really
comfortable they also have a zipper at
the end of the lake's they have the
zipper detail right there so I paired it
with the first shirt that I showed you
and I also tried on a couple other tops
with this as well I think what's like
brown boots gray boots tall boots I
think this would look really cool and of
course I love the olive color I don't
know if I should blame a man to anything
but I'm really into olive and the greens
which you will see in this hall as well
but I really like these jeans I thought
they were really comfortable again I did
a size small and they were $39 got is a
top as well and this seems to be a
pretty popular top I think it was called
by the Stasi top or the Stasi top so
this is what it looks like again kind of
like this mint I kind of like a mint
color here and it has a long sleeves but
then it has a shoulder cutouts so like
this if you can see so it has like the
shoulder cutouts right here and I just
thought that detail was really cool
I love the mint green color as well I
got mine in a medium and it is $36
I think the medium fits just fine on me
I don't think it's really even too big
but the reason that I got the medium for
this particular one is cuz they didn't
have any other size small left in the
store so I went with the medium simply
because I wanted the shirts so bad
because I thought it was so super cute
but yeah the medium fits just fine on me
I just really like the the detail of it
I like the color of it that could pair
really well with leggings or skinny
jeans again boots fall love it all so
again this was $36 so another top that I
got is like the olive green color and it
is a more like a tank have like cowlick
cowl-neck details right here and it is
Sulli vollis and i really like the way
it feels it's like soup
soft material I love the color and I
thought it went really well with my eyes
too so again I just couldn't pass it up
the color the material I even liked the
cowl-neck which like usually it's not
super my thing because weirdly enough
like I'm claustrophobic and sometimes
like anything around my neck I can kind
of get weirded out about but this was
super comfortable and I thought it was
really flattering on so really excited
that I got it I got mine in size small
and it is $44 for myself are these like
lace bra tops so I've been seeing a lot
of people wearing these lately and they
are super comfortable I wasn't totally
sure what I was gonna think about him
when I put them on but I ended up loving
them so much I bought two different
colors I mean I think that's just how it
works but I really love this like blush
nude one right here I just thought it
was super cute then this is what the
back looks like so I just love the lace
detail it it's like so feminine you can
wear them under tops you could wear them
alone I guess if you really want to I
don't know I probably would but even
like working out like if you have like I
have a few sports bras that aren't like
super cute and I do allow my workouts
like for online or for like social media
I'm posting pictures and um so sometimes
I try to wear like nice they were
looking close but I have a couple sports
bras that I could like wear and then put
this over it and it would kind of be a
little bit cuter you know what I'm
saying I wouldn't recommend working out
in these because there is like no
support to them so probably not
something to easily work out in and in
the clips I'm showing you I did keep on
like my regular bra when I tried these
on because I didn't have anything to put
under it and I just wanted to make sure
we didn't have any any issues no issues
at all just want to make sure there was
no issues so I did keep my regular bra
but I'm regularly I probably would that
unless I'm doing something like working
out for you know filming or doing a
video but I just thought these were
super cute a lot of people are wearing
on that right now I know Victoria's
Secret has them too but I decided to
pick up two I also got a blue one as
well so I mean exact same thing just in
this really pretty like deep blue color
so I just thought they were so pretty I
got both of mine in the size small and
they are $24 of
our liking the lace trend that's going
around right now these are a really good
option that I picked up from top off
clothing again remember you can use the
discount code Samantha and get 15% off
you get free shipping and four orders
over $25 or more everything that I
mentioned will be linked down below so
that's everything from Topalov so why
don't we go ahead and jump over to my
misguided haul in case you missed it
youtuber Carli bybel did a collection
was misguided who I believe they are
like an online retailer out of the UK
I've never ordered anything from
misguided before but I did hear a lot of
really good things about him I just
never myself ordered from them but when
I saw that karlie was doing a collection
with them I watched her video on the
collection I was looking at the
different photos online and there was a
few pieces that really stood out to me I
got was like you know what I can really
see myself wearing them and wearing them
often so and like I said the original
launch day was just a mess I mean I'm
not shocked getting anybody when I say
that misguided knew it Carly knew it
like it was just craziness I tried for
like two hours to get clothes and you'd
put something in your basket and all
sudden it's out of your basket and you
try to check out your basket empty all
of a sudden like it was just weird so
they ended up doing a relaunch for it
they ordered in a few like up the most
popular pieces and did a relaunch and it
went much smoother and I actually was
kind of worried because I was gone the
day that it relaunched and by the time I
saw her snapchat saying it was backup it
said it was from five hours ago and I
was like well there's no way that
there's gonna be anything left but they
ordered I think she said it was like
triple or quadruple of the original
quantities they ordered so much more to
try to get everybody accommodated
because so many people were upset
so even when I went on five hours later
there was still pieces there and then
even now I checked the website the day
that I'm filming and there's still
pieces there so if you haven't gotten
anything I would check it out
it does mean like mascara does a lot of
sales quite frequently they were just
doing like a 30% off sale if they are
running a sale it is available on the
Carli bybel collection as well
I kind of wondered if that would be the
case and it is and Carly's been saying
that on her snapchat too so I will leave
the missguided up link down below of
course as well and all these pieces that
I will be
you but I thought it was really cool
that they ordered so much stock that the
craziness was not there my order took me
like five days to get to me or something
like that it was not very long so it's
pretty impressed with it but the first
thing that I got was the like rose or
blush matching separates I've been
really into the matching suffers lately
and like I said these are close to that
like for the likings especially I'll be
able to wear around the house the tops
you know maybe I'll be able to wear out
sometimes or to wear both of them like
in a workout clothes as well so so these
are what the leggings will look like
they're really pretty like rose color
they are a cropped legging and they are
high-waisted they have a pretty thick
band and I thought they you know they
sit up pretty high I wasn't sure what
size to get in I ended up going with a
size two honestly I probably could have
done a zero and I don't wear your zeros
I'm gonna sleep between a 2 and a 4 and
it's not that I think they're too big
like they're fine and I am gonna keep
them but I could have gone smaller and
it would have been just fine so that
could be something to keep in mind like
I can keep pulling these up to like my
chest it's like that's how much room
they have in them but it doesn't look
too wide on my hips but so it worked out
but I could have done a size smaller but
they are really really comfortable and
like I said they're high-waisted which I
really do like in the leggings but I
mean I can see these for going out I can
see these for lounging I can seem for
working out like I ended up really
really liking those leggings and then
the matching top that went along with it
is a turtleneck crop top so this is what
this one looks like so hopefully the
turtleneck right here and then it does
have the long sleeves and it is a crop
as well I really like it together this
would be really pretty with skinny jeans
or black leggings anything like that I
got a size two as well and this again I
probably could have done a zero and it
would have been fine but I really loved
the way it looked both pieces were only
like $19.50 or something which I thought
was really affordable and I think that I
will be able to get a lot of use out of
these other set of matching separates as
well and this was the gray blue matching
separates there's been a lot of
confusion over if it's gray or it's blue
I think at the website listed it as
gray I honestly when I see in a person I
think it's more blue so who knows
but again the leggings are basically the
same as the pink ones they are the crop
legging they have the thick band and
they are more high-waisted as well again
I ordered a size two probably could've
done a zero but a two is just fine I
mean really basically they're the same
things as other leggings just a
different color at the very comfortable
I can wear foot working out for lounging
going out so I really like it these
leggings and again they were only $19.50
or something like that and then the
matching top that came with it is a
another crop top and this is what this
one looks like and so it has the
sleeveless and a bit more of like a
scoop neck but nothing like super low I
didn't think again I got a size two I
think it's nice to was good in this top
the zero might have been maybe a little
bit too tight in the chest area so I
thought the two were felt well for me so
I really like it I like the way they
look together I mean I could probably
mix and match between the matching
separates again I could probably wear
this with leggings I don't know if I
would like I'm like it a lot what's
denim maybe if I had like a jacket over
it maybe but I don't know if I would
love it with denim but other leggings as
well definitely I could wear this with
so again this was the $19.50 as well so
I thought it was really affordable I did
get free shipping with the order too so
it wasn't anything crazy for shipping so
I ended up really liking both pairs of
the matching separates that I got so I
was really happy about that the last
piece I was really excited to get and I
was also really surprised that I got it
since I told you guys I was on five
hours after the launch I figured this
would be one of the first things that
was sold out and actually I checked as I
was filming this video and it's actually
still in stock but that is the rose gold
satin bomber so this had so much hype
around it it is a beautiful bomber
jacket it has this like gorgeous tie
detail along the sleeves its satin rose
gold which is such a beautiful color
it's a zip up in the front does zip in
the front that does have two pockets as
well really excited that I got it it was
kind of surprised like I mentioned that
I did and
wasn't
to me is that I thought I ordered this
in a four and I did order it in a two
huh
I thought I got a four cuz I figured I'd
go size up four coats but it is actually
a size two and I like the way it fits I
like the way it fits in the arm I like
the way it fits along the waist but it
is a really long like in my opinion it's
like awkwardly long and the other bomber
that she had up was more of like a
pistachio green color and that was a
very short bomber and I was kind of
going back and forth between the two and
I ended up going for this one
mostly for the color and for the detail
along the arms but I the only thing that
I don't like about it is how long it is
and when I first heard when I first
heard it on I was like no way not nope
I'm returning this it was $64 I'm like I
think it looks weirdly long on me
I liked in the pictures that were shared
like the satin dresses and then wearing
this over it but I was like I don't
really have any satin dresses nor do I
think I would wear that out so I was a
little conflicted on that also it's not
really thick by any means it's it's it
really has like not much to it so I was
kind of hoping for more of an actual
jacket for when we get into fall and I
want to wear a jacket for warmth - it
doesn't really offer that so I was like
you know I don't know and I took it to
top luf and I showed it to stuff and I
tried it on for and you know I'd like to
give her opinion because I think she's
really stylish and at first she was like
I agree with you you know it was just a
few inches shorter I think it'd look
really well if it hit more hips I think
it would look really good and I was kind
of walking around the store for a while
in it looking at the different clothes
and she kept looking at me and she's
like okay the more that I see it the
more it's growing on me and I was like
actually me too
like now that I'm wearing it for a while
I keep looking in the mirror like I kind
of think I do like it too so right now I
think I've made the decision that I am
going to keep it I just hope that I can
wear it enough to make it worth it
because I think it will only look good
with certain things like I don't think
this is going to look good with denim
through with dresses it might pair well
I've tried it on with both of the
matching separates that I had and I
think that it looked okay I liked it
with the blue a little bit more than
with the pink because it was kind of
like a little too monochrome for me so
might be able to do it there
but I think this is really like a
standout piece like I feel like no
matter what it would get like
complimented or you know the girls that
you know when you go out they've want to
know where you get it from so hopefully
I'm able to wear it enough to make it
worth it because I think I really have
to cite it that I am going to keep it
cuz I just ended up actually really
liking it the more I wore it the more I
tried it on the bar I looked at it I was
like okay I'm going to keep it I just
wish it was a few inches shorter and
more toward on my hip area and maybe
with a little bit important for a jacket
for it but I did end up liking it I'm
really glad that I got it if you are
still interested in getting it you know
that's just kind of like my honest
feedback again this was a size 2 that's
kind of my feedback on the rose gold
bomber if you were still interested in
getting it if it's still available in
the site's that you need it's kind of my
feedback that was helpful for you guys
because this was the only piece that I
was kind of like hmm not sure about this
one I also didn't want to say too I
didn't mention with the leggings you
know some leggings can be kind of like
see-through these were not see-through
at all I didn't find them to be
see-through at all I took pictures of
them and took pictures with it in flash
there was no see-through
I think maybe panty lines might be an
issue first time that I tried it on at
home I had more like regular underwear
on and you could see panty lines through
it the other time that I tried it off
when I was on top laughs I was wearing
like thong underwear and you couldn't
see it what's the thick waistband that
it has so just want to point that out to
you guys as well but I did want to make
sure I said that about the leggings but
again the rosula bomber I got - sighs -
and it was $64 the u.s. so that was
everything that I got from misguided
overall I was really happy with what
I've got you know the initial launch was
a little bit of a headache but the
relaunch went really well my package
arrived in a timely manner so overall I
was really happy with my misguided order
everything for my clothing haul and try
on I really hope that you enjoyed this
type of videos like I said I don't do
them a whole lot but I felt you liked it
or found it helpful and maybe you found
a few items that you want to get again
