today's video is going to be a new
collective haul so I have some makeup I
have some lifestyle I have some fitness
that I thought I would share and then I
also have some new clothes that I
thought I would share also so just gonna
be a little collective haul of a few
things so I purchased here lately I am
making this video in partnership with
Poshmark which I'm so excited about I
love when I get to work with Poshmark on
videos because Poshmark is truly one of
my favorite apps and one that I've been
using for such a long time so a huge
thank you to Poshmark
for sponsoring this video I love being
able to use the app to sell some of my
clothes and my fashion especially when
I'm going to be making new clothing
hauls it's a great way to be able to
clutter up my closet and just not feel
as guilty about making some of these
purchases in here so I'm going to share
everything that I've picked up recently
and then also I'm just gonna chat a
little bit about Poshmark first and show
you some of the items that I've
decluttered
out of my closet recently but if you're
interested in seeing a new haul why
don't we go ahead and get started so if
you're not familiar with Poshmark I've
done a couple videos with them in the
past but like I said it's just one of my
favorite apps it's a free app that you
can get onto your phone I'll have a link
in the description box if you wanted to
assign up for Poshmark my closet name is
Samantha March I feel like I get asked
so often what my closet name is it's
just a-- samantha march over there on
Poshmark no space is there anything and
it's where you can buy and also sell you
know clothing shoes things like that
accessories all of that and I really
love doing it because like I said it's a
good way for me to be able to
continually kind of be decluttering out
my closet it's also of course a good way
to earn extra money so then you don't
feel as bad when you buy new clothes
because not only have you declared your
closet which is great but you've also
made some money so when you're spending
money you don't feel as bad that's the
way that I look at it so I really enjoy
Poshmark I put a lot up there also good
place to be able to buy items that
you're interested in because you can get
them for a little bit of a cheaper price
over there as well so it's great for
both buying and also selling I'll go
ahead and insert a couple photos here
like a closeup of my closet you can see
it sometimes when I put my
you can't see them the best of course so
I'll put a couple screenshots here on
the screen I've liked what my closet
looks like I do a video with Poshmark I
want to try to give like another little
tip in these videos to help either
buying or selling and what I wanted to
mention this week is bundles I feel like
it's maybe an obvious thing to some
people if you've been using the app for
a while but maybe if you're newer I've
kind of come across this as a seller a
couple times where I have the same
person buying several items in my closet
but they've purchased them separately
and when you do that you actually have
to pay for shipping on those separate
purchases so if you see a seller and you
want multiple items from their closet
you can bundle them together so not only
that when you check out with the bundle
you're only paying for shipping one time
on several items which is great but also
you can even some like for me I have a
bundle discount turned on automatically
where if people put a certain number of
items into their closet it will
automatically take a bundle discount off
for them or maybe if a seller doesn't
have that turned on you can actually
message them and say hey you know I want
to buy these five things in a bundle can
we take 10% off 20% off whatever it is
and you can put a listing in there and
then the seller can either come back and
counteroffer it or they can accept it
and that sort of thing but that way it's
a good way to be able to get a discount
on several items but then also I think
the biggest thing is only having to pay
for shipping one time I think that's
really important and they want to
mention that like I said I thought I'd
show a couple of things that I decided
to declutter from my closet this guy
here I wore it one more time just to
make sure I was okay getting rid of it
and then I just washed it so I do need
to dry it to get some of the wrinkles
out before I list it over on my Poshmark
but it's just a tank top it's kind of
like a burnt orange tank top and then
the back is really funky and crisscross
and all that kind of like an oversized a
shirt I would say but I had had it for a
couple seasons now and when I wore it
the other day I was like yeah I haven't
worn this in a while and I remember like
it's it's just no longer my favorite so
I was like you can go ahead and get rid
of it
some new shirts and tanks lately you
said you can say goodbye so that's just
one of the items that I decided to
declutter out of my closet and then I
also was trying to focus on my dresses
because I feel like I've purchased more
dresses lately especially probably cuz
we have like four or five six weddings
this year I can't remember so I was
buying dresses for them so I was like
you need to get rid of some of your
dresses so this first one here that I'm
putting up on my closet is just a black
and white dress so it's a simple kind of
like tank dress and it kind of has like
these white ruffles here I actually
bought this for one of my bridal showers
I thought it would be cute to wear and
it's from Venus which is like an online
like women's clothing boutique and it's
a USA small is what it says but it fits
really comfortably like it's not too
tired it's not overly baggy I liked it
the way that it fit but I'm just I
haven't worn it for a while so I decided
that I could go ahead and get rid of
that one and then another one that I
decided to declutter was a dress I wore
so often for a while and I just can't
runner the last time I've worn it and so
it's this black dress here and it has
kind of like really cool crochet detail
on the top and on the sleeves too again
it's just kind of like a looser dress
it's not too tight it's just really
comfortable but again I just haven't
worn it in a while so that said it too
declared that one out of my closet and
then this one is it's kind of more of
like a sweater dress type like it's more
like a softer material the sleeves the
sleeves are about three-quarter sleeves
and then it does have a little zip in
the back here as well it is pretty sheer
so when I wore it I would just wear like
a really long white tank underneath so
you couldn't you know like see-through
it totally but this was really cute to
wear with like tall nude boots because
again it goes about it's a little bit
above my knees I would say and I'm five
five but I thought it was really
flattering again nothing like too tight
but it was I will say form-fitting
without being like too form-fitting so I
really liked wearing out the other tall
boots are short like brown booties again
I hadn't reached for it yet as of this
season and like
buying some new dresses so I was like go
ahead and declutter that so those are
just a few items that I have recently
listed in my posh market have a few more
dresses and tops to that I put up there
when I did my latest closet declutter
just a couple weeks ago so I wanted to
share that with you again I'll have a
link in the description box if you're
interested in joining Poshmark
or if you already have you know feel
free to like leave your closet name or
whatnot in the comments and we can all
find each other over there because I
always love finding new people on
Poshmark as well but I thought I would
mention that and then also a Poshmark
tip if you have any good tips to make
sure to leave them in the description
box but because I did a good job
decluttering I have I'll end it with
some new clothes that I picked up but
when I'm gonna go ahead and hop over
into the makeup that I decided to
purchase okay so I have purchased a ton
of makeup lately outside of the like
kind of traditional halls that I've done
just by quite a bit of makeup but there
was a new release that I was eyeing and
I said go ahead and get it so this is a
from Mac it is their prep and prime fix
plus but it is the matte fix plus I was
really curious when this came out the
mac fix+ is one of my favorite setting
sprays I absolutely love it I like the
regular I have the lavender scented one
that is so good but when they were
coming out with a matte version I was
like especially for summer where I get a
little bit more glowy or dewy if I'm
gonna be outside for a long time I was
really really interested in this so I
just got this I did spray it on my face
today I've used it one other time I
don't know if I've noticed anything like
like instant effect results but I also
feel like I haven't used it at a time
yet where I notice that I'm like super
super glowy and I want to turn it down
so I'm kind of waiting for that to
happen so I can like really test it out
but I just got this so I haven't used it
too often but I'll definitely be giving
a review on it but that's just kind of
my first thoughts I guess kind of
looking in the mirror like do I notice
anything but I don't really felt like I
was like super glowy yet so I don't know
has anybody else tried this I'd love to
know I did go ahead and purchase this on
the Mac website because I was talking
once about wanting to try their strobe
cream and a lot of people told me on the
Mac website if you place an order you
can get a free mini
of the strobe cream and I was like okay
just had a lot of different minis to
choose from which I thought was pretty
cool so I went with the strobe cream of
course and I think this is just the
original strobe cream to have it on
today
underneath my Charlotte Tilbury magic
foundation this I could definitely tell
oh this one is in pink light pink light
it's the one that I got there was only
one option for the strobe cream so
that's what I chose but I noticed when I
put it on I mean you can instantly tell
that your face has an illumination to it
that it has a glow to it which I thought
was pretty cool since we are in summer
now I don't wear a lot of heavy
foundations if I'm going out think then
I'm really gonna like this this summer
like under the tinted moisturizer or
powder or even just days where I feel
like I don't even need foundation I'll
put this on because it like it doesn't
do anything to like cover or anything
like that so I don't have to be a timer
I'm not dealing with any breakouts or
anything but just putting this on I
really like the way that it made my skin
look I thought look pretty good so I'm
excited to keep trying this out who else
has tried the strobe cream but I'm
pretty pumped thank you for everyone
telling me I could get a little mini on
the Mac website that is what I did are
you so I did mention this next product
in my summer essentials but I picked it
up recently and I was planning on
putting it in my collective haul but
these are new sunglasses these are from
ki Australia they were a collaboration
at that youtuber does he Perkins did
with them she's done a ton of different
collaborations with ki Australia I think
there's like a whole section on their
website dedicated to all the different
sunglasses she's done but her high keys
which are these her high keys I think
are some of the most popular ones on
there I did purchase her high keys when
they first came out I purchased the gold
ones but I have like a small and like
narrow face so big sunglasses like and
these were big aviators they don't look
the best on me and I couldn't even wear
those like I couldn't take myself
seriously in them I did not look good I
ended up putting them in a giveaway and
fortunately but then she came out with
the Heike minis so these are just a
little bit smaller like same style and
everything and they have a lot of the
same colors I think all the same maybe
not all the same colors but close all
the same colors if not all but they're
just smaller so they were having
/ I think it was Memorial Day weekend
where they had 20% off I think it was
everything and does he sunglasses for
included so I've got the hiking minis
and these are the black fades so you can
see that the lens kind of fades a little
bit and I really do like these and I was
a little bit nervous because I put them
on and my husband said that they were
big on me and I was like man cuz these
are $65 sunglasses you know I did get
the 20% off but still they're expensive
sunglasses and I was like are you sure
and then I was wearing them around he
goes no I think those are a good fit
like they're not too too big like
they're big but they're not too big I'm
like okay and he also wears them and he
looks really good in them too I think he
looks better than me when you are so but
don't talk about that but I really have
been enjoying this they're kind of dirty
right now because I did wear them on the
water the other day but I'm really
liking these I put them on my summer
essentials because I feel like Sundays
are needed but yeah I really really have
been enjoying this pair I did pick up a
few like Fitness related items from
Amazon and I thought that I showed them
when I was initially thinking of my
collective haul I really wasn't thinking
about these but I get asked a lot of
questions on my fitness routines if I'll
share my fitness routines I share some
of my yoga photos over on like Twitter
now and you know I recently reviewed
like fabletics and I once again got
asked a lot of questions about fitness
in there so I'm trying to figure out the
best kind of way to talk about them cuz
I've done at least one fitness related
video in the past but like the amount of
views on it like I just I don't know how
to incorporate Fitness with a beauty
channel you know what I'm saying and I
don't want to create a little different
Fitness channel because I'm not like a
trainer I'm not an instructor I'm not
certified I just do it because I enjoy
working out so I don't know if you guys
have any ideas you can let me know but I
haven't decided what I'm gonna do but I
thought I could share in this haul what
I purchased Fitness wise to incorporate
into my routines so I've always wanted
to get some ankle weights and so I
finally got them these are from I can
never pronounce the sandwich I should be
able to but yeah you got em these were
like $15 and obviously you get to ankle
weights and these are I think they're -
they're 5 pounds so it's 2 point 5
pounds for each ankle but I just always
wanted to incorporate some ankle weights
especially
I'm working up like I'm focusing on my
lower body because it just kind of adds
an extra dimension and extra level to
your workouts so I'm excited to finally
have some ankle weights and then what
I'm really excited for is this here from
peach bands so again I got this right
off Amazon I think there were like $17
but their resistance bands for you eight
legs and I just was kind of scrolling
around on Instagram for like a
resistance bands workouts because I was
planning on picking up a pair of
resistance bands and I kept finding
peach bands and I was like what I want
what are those and they have a great
Instagram account I take a lot of
inspiration now since I found them of
the different workouts that the girls do
one there but obviously they're all
incorporating these peach fans you know
speech for your booty and they come in
this nice little pouch and then you have
all these different resistance bands
there is a four different bands that you
get and they are separated by so there's
a light a medium a heavy and an extra
heavy so you can kind of decide what it
is that you want to use in your workouts
so I'm really excited I'll leave the
peach bands in serum down below they
don't like know me or anything I just
kind of stumbled upon them using some
hashtags for some fitness ideas but I
don't have any resistance bands like
this so there's like the smaller glute
fans that you can put it on your knees
your hips you can pair around your
ankles whatever it is how you want to
incorporate them I don't have anything
like this I have like long resistance
bands are like rope resistance bands but
nothing like a loop band so I'm excited
I just made a new little like workout
routine for myself I usually change up
my fitness routines every month just so
I don't get bored and so my body doesn't
get used to certain routines
and I'm excited to be incorporating
these in there now so again I got both
these off Amazon I'll go ahead and leave
them linked down below but yeah I
thought I would share those in this
video so I don't typically share a lot
of what I get sent to me I don't do like
PR hauls or anything like that a lot of
times with like makeup and such I do
like trying to make a full face of you
know trying new releases and things like
that and that's kind of how I work what
I get in PR into my videos I just am not
really comfortable doing like this is
everything
it's just not really like my vibes at
the moment so I don't really show a lot
here on camera but I thought I would
show this because this pack is so
beautiful and I just like it makes me
feel a certain way when I carry it it's
a it's a handbag so it's not makeup so I
can't really be like showing it trying
it on or anything cuz that's the purse
but this is from Teddy Blake and this is
my new handbag I think she is so pretty
and I just feel I feel like so classy
when I carry it I carried it the other
night we had dinner with friends and I
was like feel like everyone's staring at
my handbag I'm sure no one was looking
at me but like in my mind that's how I
felt but again this is from Teddy Blake
I have received one other handbag in the
past from Teddy Blake it's what I've
been carrying for over a year and it's
still in great shape which is awesome
I'm just planning on carrying this for
the summer since it's more of the blue
color and then switching back to my
other nude Teddy Blake handbag but I
really really like this one so this one
is called the Bela Palma Wado
I think I'm hopefully I'm saying that
correctly and it's the 12 inch bag and
the light blue so again here's what she
looks like it has the Teddy Blake logo
logo right here it says Teddy Blake New
York I'll have the website listed down
below and then inside it's a really
really big bag so it opens up like this
you can see my wallet and my allergy
medicine I was staying with my brother
I'm allergic to dogs and he has two
beagles and they shed a lot so I had to
take my allergy medicine when I went and
stayed at his house being allergic to
dogs is really cruel when you're a dog
lover off topic but it has a huge inside
here and then it also has two zippered
pockets on the side so you can put in
whatever you want in here so there's two
zippers on each side it also did come
with a big strap if you'd want to have
it as like more of the regular strap but
I love the handles on the side and I
don't know what it is it just like makes
me feel a certain way and I'm just
really really liking this bag so a huge
thank you to Teddy Blake for sending
this to me I love the color I think it's
so beautiful like this is the color I'm
into right now you guys have seen me
wearing a lot of blue like
recently in my videos and I've been
getting so many nice compliments on the
color and now to have like a matching
handbag I feel like so it's just thought
it's just like really exciting for me
you know it just really is so a big
thing you did Teddy Blake for sending
this to me I I thought I would mention
it in here even though I did not
purchase this myself it was sent to me
but so that was really beautiful and
since I've carried one of their bags for
like I said a year now and it's still in
great quality like in great shape I just
thought I would throw it out there in
case anyone's interested or you're
interested in a new handbag or anything
like that I just think this one was
really nice sell so again I'll have the
tape like website listed down below and
also have this bag listed down there as
well but I thought she was really pretty
so I just thought I would throw that one
in here as well but then to wrap up the
video I'm just gonna share some of the
new outfits that I bought so I made a
couple purchases from Laura's boutique I
mentioned them in my last collective
haul too I have just been loving Laura's
boutique I found them on Instagram I
think again through a hashtag and I have
now made like 6 or 7 different purchases
from Laura's boutique like it's just my
type of style my type of 5 they're very
like trendy pieces as well and I think
the prices are good and she runs sales
every once in a while I don't think I've
purchased anything that she hasn't had
like a coupon code for coz I'm a deal
chaser but like every time she offers a
discount code I'm like yep I'm gonna buy
something else today their shipping is
super quick as well and again Laura
doesn't know me or anything like that
but they're shipping us so fast usually
when I order sometimes it ships same day
or something if I order late at night
its shipping out the next morning and I
always get it within two days so I've
been pretty impressed with it but I'll
go ahead and try on some pieces you can
see what I got okay when I do clothing
hauls like this I typically just do them
in front of my mirror in my bedroom and
the Sun has gone down so hopefully you
can see me okay I can brighten it up in
editing but I don't have any place for
lights but this is the one of the pieces
that I got from Laura's boutique it's
just a like kind of like rust colored
dress I would say it's called the Mele
dress I believe it is I'll have
everything listed and linked down below
but I really like this dress it is
double line so it doesn't show a lot
which is awesome and then it just has
you know like a regular
style straps and it goes down just past
the knees and in like it's tighter down
here but like I can still you know like
move my legs and all that fun stuff but
I just thought it was a really pretty
dress and kind of like it's just like a
casual like a casual staple you know I
thought this one was really pretty this
next item is a romper and I think it is
so cute I was actually wearing it in my
latest will I buy it video and I just
thought that this was the cutest thing
so it kind of ties over here on one side
and then the sleeves are a little bit
longer
she literally pushes open the door and
then runs down the stairs cool I thought
that this was a super cute and actually
I ordered from Laura's boutique and like
I said I've ordered there several times
and I've never had like a mix-up but
they actually didn't send this and they
sent a body suit instead that I hadn't
ordered and I was like no I really
wanted the romper and luckily I just
emailed them and I sent him a picture of
the body suit and then also they asked
for a picture of my invoice and then
they sent me over the romper right away
I was like thank goodness because the
smaller boutiques you know a lot of
times if they run out of something then
they're out of something they can't
order it again unless they were to order
in bulk so I was like please don't run
out please don't run out before you see
my email because you know I have seen
them sell out of items and I really
really wanted this because I thought it
was just so cute but I'm really excited
to get it I gotta say small it is a
little on the short side and I don't
like love my legs a time but like I'll
get over it because I think it's super
cute so the last time that I have to
share is the bodysuit that they actually
dentally sent me so they did say that I
could keep it which I thought was really
nice like I didn't know if they were
gonna want me to ship it back but they
said that I could keep it and I actually
quite liked it I don't think it would be
something that I would pick out on my
own because it's just kind of like a
regular white body student you know it
has the the different here and really
small straps but it just like wasn't
something that caught my attention but I
actually really liked it on it's very
like I mean it's very very form-fitting
you can see but I just threw it on with
a pair of trousers from Express cuz I
just thought it made a cute outfit and I
actually quite liked it so I was I was
impressed with their customer service
you know they got back to me right away
they sent me out the romper right away
and they let me keep the bodysuit which
I
we'll wear so I think this one is pretty
darn cute but I don't know the name of
it that I should have asked when I
emailed them I'm not sure the name of
this because I didn't actually order it
but I think it's pretty cute but after
that there's going to be everything from
my collective haul thank you guys so
