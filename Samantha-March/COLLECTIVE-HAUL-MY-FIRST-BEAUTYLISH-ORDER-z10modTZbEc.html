today's video it's going to be kind of a
collective haul I have my first order
from Pew delish
and then I also have some clothing
purchases to share with you as well
both fitness and then also just like
casual summer wear I am doing this video
in partnership with Poshmark which makes
me so excited Poshmark is one of my
favorite apps I've done videos with them
in the past so a big thank you to them
for sponsoring today's video I'm going
to be going over just a little bit of my
declutter process and how it kind of
plays into the purchases that I decide
to make and then I also have a couple
Poshmark tips that I thought I could
share with you as well down we are ready
for a new collective haul video let me
go ahead and get started
alrighty so like I said this video is in
partnership with Poshmark which has me
excited because it is one of my favorite
apps I am in the Poshmark app every
single day both as a seller and also as
a buyer definitely do sell a lot of
clothes on Poshmark
and it's just such a good feeling to be
able to do a closet declutter get rid of
some of the items that you haven't worn
as much but are in still good condition
give them a new home but then it also
makes me feel not quite as guilty of
making these purchases I have wanted to
purchase from beauty lace for the
longest time and I've wanted some higher
price brands you're gonna see some
Charlotte Tilbury in this video which
has me very excited but I was doing a
declutter recently you know we have the
warmer weather the spring weather I'm
definitely on spring cleaning mode and I
was like I'm really gonna go after it
I'm gonna clean out my closet I'm going
to be more focused because you guys ever
have that thing where you go through
your closet and your declutter and
you're like I haven't worn that in a
year but next month I might where I do
that all of the time and it's so
frustrating because the next year I come
back and I'm like I remember keeping
that last year and I didn't wear it once
so I really did like a pretty good
closet declutter recently I think and I
was very excited about it and I was like
you know what if I can do a good job and
sell these clothes on Poshmark
I will make this beauty list order and
also in order you'll see like a fitness
outfit that I purchased as well from a
company that I was talking about them
last year saying I wanted to make a
purchase but athletic wear is expensive
like no matter what brain that seems you
go with they're very high-priced
so again I was like do a good job
clean out your closet and then you can
kind of like reward yourself like not
only did you make room in your closet
and your drawers but you also you know
you earned that money back with selling
on Poshmark and now I don't feel as
guilty buying these outfits that I
really really want are these makeup
products that I really want so that's
kind of what I did it was about two
weekends ago I think it was I had some
time and I just went after it so I
thought I would show a few pieces that
are in my closet I really went through
and tried to look at what I had for like
my kind of like my nicer dressier
clothes I did used to work at a hospital
I left oh I don't know five years ago I
think it was but I did work at a
hospital and I worked in admin and so
you know I wore nice clothes a lot now I
do work fully from home you know on
YouTube and then I'm also an author of
my next book my sixth book is coming out
next week which is super exciting and so
I do get to do this full-time but it
means that I don't wear these clothes
anymore and I mean it's always nice to
have a nice you know pair of trousers or
two in your closet or if you do
something nicer you know I just spoke at
a Writers Conference last week and I
wore you know a nice pair of pants in a
nice top but I had a lot in my closet
that I was like you are not touching
this and these are nice clothes
I love Express and I purchased from
Express so much these are a pair from
Express and they're a pair of just like
khaki capris so which are really nice
going into another spring summer these
are the editor pants and again in a size
two but again just not something that I
get a ton of use out of it but I kept
hanging on to them in my closet like
maybe someday and I'm like that's not
gonna work and then I also put like I
have some denim in there as well my
Victoria Secret jeans have really been
selling quite a bit I just went to the
post office this morning with another
pair of Victoria's Secret denim but I
think there's still a few pairs up there
you know some tops some workout wear but
this is a dress that I think is really
pretty this is from Venus they're like
an online company and I shopped with
them quite a bit like right around
post-college but it's just kind of like
a new dress and it has these kind of
like ruffles over here and then the lace
detail I wore this to one of my friends
like her rehearsal dinner for her
wedding and then I
never wanted since so this was only one
one time this is a US size two and I
don't know why I don't wear it more or
why I just never really gravitated
towards it a lot but I saw it in my
closet and I was like you've not burn
that since her rehearsal dinner like why
are you still hanging on to it and
especially I feel like I'm kind of
buying more dresses and like casual
summer dresses and stuff and this one is
a little bit more fancy and I just don't
have as many places to wear it now
you know as we get into our 30s we don't
have as many weddings that were going to
so that's probably a part of it as well
I do sometimes put some stuff from my
husband up there as well he really wears
his clothes like to the ground today I
mean until they're just like dirty and
holy and there's really nothing to do
but throw them away but every once in a
while he'll tell me something that he
doesn't like or I'll go through his side
of the closet be like once the last time
you've worn this and if it's a new
condition I'll go ahead and put it on my
Poshmark I know Poshmark is mostly
focused towards women but if you're ever
doing any searching for your husband you
know I know some sellers do put up men's
stuff as well and like for example like
these are a pair of shoes that he bought
last year and a lot of our friends were
buying shoes like this we got from DSW
and they are an original penguin sarah
ten-and-a-half but it would be on the
app for a shirt but like all of our
friends were buying these shoes and like
he thought he needed them so he bought
them and then he wore them one time and
he was like no these are just not for me
which looking at them I'm like these are
not Mitchell style at all I don't really
know why I bought born in one time and
then he was like I'm never gonna wear
these again so I added those of my
Poshmark as well but those are just a
few items that I have up there as it is
just a Samantha March but this is just
what my closet looks like I do have my
ring light on today but you can see I
just have kind of a variety of items in
there from shoes and bags and denim and
shorts and casual tops and you know some
of it just stuff is in there as well so
it is just a free app I'll have it
linked in my description box of course
I'll have my closet name down there as
well but it's just a free app to be able
to buy it and sell and it just helps me
out so much I will also say one tip and
one thing that I've been really into
lately is the private offer that you can
send to people as a seller you can send
them a private offer if they have liked
something in your closet so this is kind
of a tip for both sides buyers and
sellers if you are looking to buy
something and you're in someone's closet
and you see something that you like but
maybe it's a little bit out of your
price range right now maybe you get paid
next week or something but you don't
want to forget about it make sure that
you like it I think that part is really
important but also on the seller side we
have an option to send a private offer
to anyone who has liked a product and I
think that is pretty cool and I've been
really really utilizing that lately and
I feel like I've seen my sales increased
by doing that so you're not actually
changing the price publicly on that item
in your closet so if someone wouldn't
knew would go to your closet and they
would see you know you have this shirt
list it for $20 what you can do is you
can send a private offer to anyone who's
liked it and say you know what you know
I want to get rid of this product I want
to move this product because you liked
it I'm gonna offer it to you for $10 and
that will go out to everybody who was
like that product and then you know it's
kind of one of those things who ever
decides to buy it first can buy it for
that $10 you know maybe no one will but
it still it's not gonna change the
public price of it it's still gonna be
the $20 and I think that's really cool
so that's a tip for both a buyer and a
seller because as a seller you're able
to maybe move more product and then as a
buyer you can possibly get something for
a little bit cheaper simply because you
liked that product so that's one of the
new things that I wanted to say I've
never mentioned that in any of my other
past Poshmark videos because it's kind
of something newer to me but once I've
started doing it I've been really
enjoying that feature on it so that's
just a little bit about Poshmark I just
wanted to share a few things that I have
and they're kind of talk about my
declutter process and how it kind of
helps me when I decide I'm going to make
a purchase and then I wanted to offer
that little tip in there as well just
because it's something that I've been
utilizing so much lately but again if
you don't have the Poshmark app I'll
have the link down below and it's a free
app and I think it's pretty darn cool
and like I said I'm in there every
single day as both the buyer and the
seller and I just think it's really
awesome so a big THANK YOU to Poshmark
for sponsoring that portion of the video
and for letting me show what I got in my
collective haul but if you would like to
see some of the new items that I've
picked up we go ahead and jump into that
Before we jump into the outfits that I
purchased I'm going to talk about my
Jewish order I'm so excited
like
that I've been trying to purchase from
Beauty lish for the longest time but a
lot of the brands that I want to
purchase on Beauty lish we're definitely
more high-end they're more costly and
all of that so that kind of is what
played a big part in my you are going to
declutter your closet and declutter it
good girlfriend I mentioned bootylicious
in my last video but I've said that I
was extremely impressed with how
ordering went when I was placing my
order and I was on the last page at the
very bottom it said you know in like
italics it was like oh due to a high
number of orders your order might not be
processed for an additional one to two
days and I was like that's okay like I
mean I wasn't in like an extreme hurry
or anything like that I was getting the
free shipping so I was like no big deal
I know the shipping confirmation three
hours later three hours after placing my
order I was like I thought this wasn't
gonna be processed for like two days or
three days or something in three hours
my order had already shipped I was like
okay Beauty lish I see you it got to my
door the two days after I ordered it and
everything I wish I would have taken a
picture
everything was so nicely wrapped like to
the items were wrapped together with
nice paper and had a little bow on top a
little black bow was tied on top of it I
was like ah yes did someone give this to
me like it was the cutest thing and you
know when you order from Sephora they
just throw your stuff in there no bubble
wrap and they put that crinkly piece of
brown paper on top and like you cross
your fingers that your stuff from
Sephora is gonna read undamaged
and a lot of times it doesn't Oh major
kudos to Beauty lish they also do have
their payment plan it offered it to me I
think that it offered it to me in three
separate payments so if you don't want
to pay the full price right up front I
think how it went was you could pay a
portion of it after it shipped so you
would be billed once it shipped and then
since mine said it could split into
three it was just gonna be the next two
months there was going to be a portion
of it taken out I think that's really
cool it's kind of a little bit about my
experience with Beauty lish and like I
said I got some items from Charlotte
Tilbury
and I'm very excited I wanted two of
these items for the longest time you've
heard me talk about them in videos but
they're just pricey so I've never
but I did it okay so from here we have
the Hot Lips lipstick I'm very excited
about this and this is in the names not
on the box but it's in the Kim K W which
is a nude and I'm really hoping that I
like it this is a $34 lips tight guys
$34 the packaging looks really nice okay
okay let's open it up whoo
that looks nice okay so there's what
that looks like and then yeah so it has
the name on the bottom here so Kim K W
I'm gonna go ahead and do a swatch there
is a swatch of Kim K W it's extremely
light it's very nude and it's kind of
has it's more of like a pinky nude I
would say and it looks like it has a bit
of a sheen to it as well um not like
glossy but just a bit of a sheen so I'm
excited I'm excited to hopefully I love
it it looks like it would be a good
summer color for me though as I'm
wearing like dark dark lip but it looks
really pretty fingers crossed I like it
because $34 be pricy and then the other
item this is one that I've won it for an
extremely extremely long time and look
at it all bubble wrap
nice and slow I can't even get it now
it's so bubble wrapped in here so this
is the airbrush a flawless finish powder
this is $45 of the skin perfecting micro
powder I hear everybody talking about
this and I've been getting more and more
into setting powders recently I've been
using them a lot I really like the one
from covergirl I just feel like I've
been going to my powders quite a bit and
especially as we get into summer I
notice that I tend to wear powder more
so I thought it would be a good timing
purchase and all of that so here's what
she looks like very reflective I got
mine in the shade 2 medium again mostly
knowing that I'd wear it a lot in the
summer sometimes I just wear powder like
I won't wear foundation if I'm gonna be
like going out I won't wear a liquid
foundation or anything so I'll just wear
a powder
honestly that doesn't even look too dark
here's what it looks like on camera it
really doesn't even look that dark so oh
it feels nice and soft it has a mirror
inside whoo I mean it's a pretty light
powder but there's the swatch of the
number two I'm excited to try that on my
face it feels really smooth - ooh as I
blend it out a lot of people say
really good things about this I've seen
people pan this before like I've gone
through the entire thing they've
repurchased it so I really want to give
it a try so I'm very excited about that
can't wait to use it and then the other
item that I purchased I'm pretty excited
about this - this is from Asia way and
I've never bought anything myself from
g'way cosmetics I've received a couple
like some other samples and like if see
bags and things like that but I've never
made it purchase myself a fridge away so
this is one of the blush of bouquets I
talked about these ennoble I buy a video
back when they were releasing which was
a while ago and I said that I wanted to
purchase one so I finally did look at
that I think as you wait they're not at
Sephora or Alta I know you can get them
on their website and some beauty
influencers do have codes but when I saw
them on Beauty alysha's well I was like
this is gonna be perfect so I bought the
one in a Coquette I think that packaging
is really nice on these as well so this
one is in Coquette and inside you have a
mirror and the two different shades so I
was thinking about getting the nude one
I think it's called like adore me and
it's just kind of got like a peachy or
blush in there and then almost kind of
like a more neutral blush that one was
actually sold out on the Beauty lush
website but honestly when I was looking
at them I was like you know what I have
those blushes in my collection so maybe
it was a good thing that it was sold out
I don't have a lot like this especially
this kind of deeper shade right here I
don't have a ton like that in my
collection was I feel nice and smooth
nice and soft so there is what those two
will look like and we'll just do Wow
okay so there's those two swatches right
there of the blushes they look really
nice these were $30 but you know it's a
little bit pricey so it'd be $15 per
blush but I can see myself reaching into
this blush palette quite a bit I like
those two shades in there I like the
mirror packaging is really nice really
sturdy if I wanted to like travel
anywhere with it so I'm excited my first
is you weigh purchase really at my first
Charlotte Tilbury purchase I have a
couple other products from her but they
were all sent to me in PR so that's my
first I show that till they are
purchased as well and my first beauty
lush so I'm really excited let me know
if you have any of these through
products that I picked up from Beauty
lish
than that moment we go ahead and jump
into showing you some of my new outfits
okay so I'm gonna do this part kind of
vlog style since it's not like a
traditional one of like my clothing haul
and Tryon videos but this is the Fitness
outfit that I got that I was telling you
about this is from a bombshell
sportswear they are kind of known for
these soft leggings like I said I was
talking about them last year and really
really wanted to make a purchase but
they are in the $80 range so they just
came out with their high-waisted sock
leggings which is great but these are
$86 so like you see why I was trying so
hard to get as much as I could up on
Poshmark $86 it's definitely very pricey
for leggings unfortunately I mean I I
love yoga I love working out and I love
having cute workout clothes and they are
just all expensive and it just kind of
is what it is but these are so cute
these are their peach ones again they
are high waisted and they have kind of
like this sock legging detail which I
just think is like the cutest thing and
they're super super comfortable and I'm
just I am loving them and I also got the
sports bra from them this is also a
peach one and then this is kind of what
that looks like if you can see the best
eye film by myself of course that's a
little bit hard but I just thought all
the detailing on here was super cute but
again this was $58 so very pricey but
I'm really happy with this outfit I
think that it is super cute everything
fits really well I got a small in both
the sports bra and in the leggings and I
think that they look really nice I did
notice that they have a rewards program
which i think is awesome you get points
just for signing up you get points for
every purchase you get points on your
birthday and you can use those points to
redeem for money off your your clothing
so I think that's awesome I'm a loving
the sock leggings they're expensive but
I just think they're great and I
definitely going to plan on purchasing
more so next up I made some purchases
from the website Laura's boutique I just
found them on Instagram one day and I am
really enjoying them I made a purchase I
don't a couple months back and I really
liked a lot of what I got so I've
actually just made two purchases I just
got another set in today what
my banks this is from the first purchase
that I did about a month ago this is
called the Laurent app I believe it was
and I think it was like 14.99 I got it
in olive it's just kind of like a super
casual top it is more of a crop but I
like that it's not like super tight it's
just kind of more of like no it's just
kind of more casual I just think it's
really cute and it fits me really well I
got a small when I went to make my last
order she was doing the sale for
Mother's Day it was 20% off I was
actually gonna purchase more of these
and they were sold out in every single
color so clearly this one was a big hit
on the website I'm gonna wait and see
and when they come back because there's
a gray one of these that I really want
but I just think these are like a nice
staple like I can see myself wearing
this a lot this summer except I just
kind of threw this yellow top over the
sports bra but I actually kind of don't
hate help a peach in the yellow look
this one I want to say it was called
like the eliza top I think it was 2099
so I got mine in this really beautiful
yellow shade I'm really feeling on
yellow for like spring/summer I just
think it's really cute and it's nice and
like lightweight and you know it's like
fairly see-through as well and then it
is a crop and it ties here you can
either tie it you can leave it untied
you can leave it longer kind of like a
cardigan style
I think tied is really cute I was
wearing in a video the other day and I
just had like a white tank top on and
then this this could be a cute swimsuit
cover-up even I mean maybe if it's gonna
get like chilly on the boat or something
you could throw this on over your
swimsuit but I just thought it was
pretty cute as well and again they have
a lot of different colors of this I
might actually pick up another color
because I just think again this could be
a really cute summer staple so I really
like this one and I love the color this
next one is a crop top this is the
assembly at the top I also have the
Samantha jeans from Laura's boutique in
white they're super cute I got this in a
size small it says it's a mustard I'm
it's kind of like I feel like it's in
between a yellow and a mustard and sorry
I don't have the best lighting in my
bedroom of life but you know that's like
real life I don't I don't have lighting
in my bedroom weird but I think that
it's still super cute and again it is
cropped it's more form-fitting than the
other one that I was showing but I don't
think it's like too short especially if
you wear it with something high waisted
I still think it's super cute so again
this is these Samantha top I got it in
sighs small and yeah I just got this one
in the mail so that fits really well
that is cute
okay this is super cute this is why I
made my purchase on Mother's Day because
I had wanted this but I was a little
unsure if it would look great on me
Laura
from Laura's boutique has like the best
body ever so sometimes I try to be like
okay Samantha what do you actually look
like in clothes but this is super cute
this is the ginger wrapper so it is a
one-piece I love the coloring kind of
this very light blue and pink and it has
adjustable straps I'm gonna have to
tighten them up a little bit I just got
this one so sorry it's a little wrinkly
I just got out of the bag and then I
just had to go ahead and tie this a
little bit tighter than how it came but
this is so good I cannot wait to wear
this this summer
this was the ginger romper I got a size
small and this one was 32 99 oh the last
item that I have to show is this is
called the mini dress in taupe I'm not
sure why it's called a mini dress
because I mean it does go past my knees
I am five five but I don't know but I
definitely want to say it's a mini so I
really do like this color I like the
stripes on it as well
I like how long it is I think it would
be nice for if we have like not like a
super formal event but not like a super
casual event type of thing I think it
would look really pretty even just with
like fancy or flip-flops or something
and then of course heels would look nice
but I think this one is really pretty as
well I got a small it was $36.99 so
again I got the 20% off with the
Mother's Day sale on all of these items
from bombshell and also Laura's boutique
I bought them I think I've said that but
they know no one sent me anything no one
knows I'm making this video or anything
like that I just bought them myself but
I think this one is pretty as well so
hey that is pretty good I do like this
one but this is actually where I'm going
to end the video so thank you guys so
