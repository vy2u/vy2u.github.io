so excited to be doing today's video
because it is all about color path so I
have a color pop how to show you I have
two blushes tulipe six and four of their
liquid lipsticks and I'm so excited
because I I'm just a newfound hardcore
fan of color pop I am totally behind
these guys I think their products are so
amazing I was so impressed with what I
received especially for the price that
you pay for them so impressed so liquid
lipsticks are obviously like the huge
craze right now that is what everyone
wants that is what every makeup company
is making that's what we're all talking
about on YouTube everyone loves liquid
lipsticks and my first thought when I
first wanted to do and I know I
mentioned this on Instagram was I wanted
to get a couple liquid lipsticks from
Kat Von D and then I wanted to get a
couple liquid lipsticks from Anastasia
Beverly Hills do a video and kind of
compare both brands give my feedback on
them see if I had like a favorite
because those are two you know pretty
high-end very popular brands especially
when it comes to their liquid lipsticks
there's so many colors out there that
people are loving but people are loving
them so that means they are sold out
there there was a few specific colors
for each line that I really wanted to
get for myself and then kind of my
thought plan was to get the colors that
you know I really want for myself and
then I'd wear and then also get like a
few wild cards in there to be able to
show you guys as well but it seemed that
all of the ones that I want it for
myself were sold out could not find I
mean I was going to the Sephora we have
like three different sephora sin my town
i was driving all over town going the
difference of forest couldn't find him
couldn't even find these shades when we
went on our chicago trip and I went to
the Sephora in Chicago not there either
i'm talking about of course like Lolita
and bow and arrow those are probably the
top two that I wanted to get from kat
von d from anastacio I mean what color
Denton I want the one that I wanted so
bad was Veronica and
just was so impossible to find the
Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipsticks
are sold exclusively at Macy's you can
get them at Macy's online but I found
that the online just did not have a lot
of shades out there I think another one
that I really want it was lovely
couldn't find it wasn't even on the
macy's website at all we don't have any
Macy stores in Iowa but again when we
went on our chicago trip last month i
made my girlfriend's go into a Macy's
with me and I couldn't find the liquid
lipsticks and I finally asked someone
and they were like oh no we don't carry
anastacio at this store you'd have to
drive in our crosstown across Chicago to
go to a different Macy's to find them
and I'm like just forget it because I'm
sure we'll get there and they'll be sold
out anyways so that idea really fizzled
through but I really still want liquid
lipsticks and I still wanted to be able
to buy some for myself be able to wear
with and also of course talk about them
on here I saw a bunch people talking
about color pop like kathleenlights
talks about color pop a lot coffee break
with Danny comp talks about color pop a
lot as well then I saw the prices and
then I thought let's just go ahead and
place an order so I'm going to get in
the full reviews i will do swatches of
everything on my hands versus on my lips
because i'm going to talk through
everything this is my first color pop
video i wanted to be able to chat with
you guys and let you guys know like my
thoughts and all that good stuff IM
planning on placing another order for a
few more liquid lipsticks probably a few
blushes maybe a highlighter and I don't
have any of their eyeshadows yet but I'm
going to place another order so I
thought for that swatch video maybe I
can do them on my lips and not do any
sort of talk through but for this one
I'll splash on my hands but i do have
each individual lipstick swatched or
knots watched but a photo of it on my
lips on Instagram you know holding the
lipstick and then you can see it on my
lips and I say what shade it is the only
color I did not do that for with sallow
which is what I'm wearing on my lips
right now so you guys can see it all of
those pictures are on my Instagram page
I am March books beauty on Instagram
that will be linked below there also is
the big giveaway still going on now on
the Instagram page so be sure to head
over there and check it out but for now
let's get into my home so first I'm
going to talk about the blushes and
got two of them I got quarters and
between the sheets and i got these
because i have both or i thought that
both would be pretty good fall colors
and so that's why i gravitated towards
them in the sheets okay one thing i will
say if you see me like struggle to open
these is that color pop says it when
they shipped the package there's like a
little notes in there to say like how to
care for your color pop and they do say
for the blushes to make sure you close
the lids really tight or else it can
kind of like affect the product and dry
it out so if you see me like trying to
struggle to open these blushes it's
because when I close them I close them
real hard because I don't want to lose
any product Bentley a different formula
it's like it's it's like you can press
down on it it's almost kind of mu C is
the word I here being described like it
honestly almost actually kind of feels
wet when I put my finger in it but it's
so it's just very different okay so
between the sheets is right here it's
subscribed on the website as like a cool
mid-tone pink color and it also is in a
matte finish but I think it's really
gorgeous not a super light pink I think
calling it that like mid-tone beige pink
is a really good way to describe it of
course with his why else would they put
it on their website about what a good
way to describe it but I really love it
I thought it was good for fall because
it's not a super light pink or baby pink
it's got a little bit more emphasis to
it so i thought i'd be really good for
call for fall so that is between the
sheets and the other ones that I got is
quarters and that is a close up of that
one and quarters is a satin blush so it
has a satin finish that's what it looks
like on my finger so that one is
quarters right here if you can see that
one okay i have never swatched the blush
before I wasn't quite sure where to
swatch that that's kind of a weird spot
I will work on that for the next video
but that is quarters and it is what I'm
wearing on my cheeks today described on
the website as a dusty coral and I mean
coral I would agree with but it's almost
kind of like a deeper core
honestly and I that's why I thought it
was so good for fall it just seemed like
such a good fall color for me so
honestly I purchased these last month
but in my mind I kind of knew like I
really don't have any fall blushes I
have Dolce pink from Milani which is a
really light pink shade and then I have
like two other one really bright pink
from elf and then a kind of a lighter
one from ELF as well so I didn't have
anything was like more color to it so I
really wanted to expand my blush
collection and I'm really happy with
both of these blushes I think they'll
work great for fall but then of course I
think you be able to wear me around the
blushes are eight dollars on the
colour-pop website which i think is a
fantastic price you get a lot of product
this is again what it looks like these
are called they're super shock cheek
just so you know as well that you get so
much product in there and I just think
it's wonderful the way to apply color
pop because it has such a different
consistency people either say that you
can use your fingers to apply it or if
you have like any duo fiber brushes or
like I use a stippling brush from ELF um
I think it's considered like a concealer
brush but I use it as a blush brush and
something with that instead of using
like a regular fluffy blush brush I
don't think you'll be able to get the
same like Kapow from colour-pop so they
actually recommend it as well when they
sent the blushes that had that little
like guy down there saying you know how
to close it with brush to use that sort
of thing I am going to be putting in an
order with morphe brushes here shortly
and I'm going to get an actual like duo
fiber brush brush that's a little bit
bigger than the brush I'm using now but
I'm getting that specifically for these
color pop blushes because I'm obsessed
with them and I'm wearing them like but
I have two lippie Stix and I got the
colors cookie and Westie now they're
lippie Stix are five dollars what I
think is really interesting about their
lippie Stix is that each lippy stick
comes with a like matching lip pencil so
it's basically like a lip liner but they
have a corresponding color for each
lippy stick so I mean the kind of the
point is like you buy
together and then you already have
imagined lip liner you don't have to
worry about trying to find a lip liner
in your collection or going out and
buying a new one because they make it
for you because this was my first
colour-pop order and I just you know
really was I'm sure how I was going to
take to the products i just purchased
the individual lippie Stix and I did not
do their lip pencils with them but that
is an option and honestly I think the
next color pop order i do if i do any
lippie Stix i'll probably to get the
pencil just so I can you know again see
what that does but then also hey I have
another lip liner in my collection the
first one that I have here is cookie and
this is in a matte finish it says on the
website that this is a true nude beige
and I just think it's so pretty and
these are so creamy like they're just so
creamy so that is cookie in the lippy
stick and it is I mean it is a true nude
beige it looks so beautiful on the lips
it's such a like how would I describe it
it's just such a neutral color you can
wear it anywhere you can wear it to work
you can wear it out you know maybe I
don't know what exactly their lip liner
is for cookie but you know you could put
maybe a darker lip liner and kind of
bring out the darker color and the lippy
stick you could wear a lighter one and
keep it more on the mutant side I mean I
just think it's gorgeous and such a good
neutral to have in your collection and
then the other lippy stick that I got
was westie and this is also in a matte
finish described on the website as a
soft dusty baby pink and again that's
what it is it almost has like a purple
undertone maybe to it like a lilac
undertone but that is what that looks
like and it is super super light pink on
the lips like I can I can apply it a few
times to make it a little bit of a
darker pink but if you just put on one
coat maybe even two coats it is a really
really light pink but again it's so
beautiful if you love pinks in your
collections this is such a good one to
have and the livi six are only five
dollars I mean like to buy Maybelline
lipsticks those are still like seven or
eight dollars and your
getting these for five dollars and I
know on the club website I think it's if
you order thirty dollars or more I think
then you get free shipping so I mean
what i would recommend doing is you know
kind of taking inventory of what
products that you want to get and
building a list up and then putting your
order in so that you make sure that you
can get that free shipping instead of
just starting like one or two lipsticks
and then in a few months like ordering
one or two more like put it all together
to get that free shipping but yes again
this is cookie and Westie cookie westie
and i love both of them those are really
getting into what i was really excited
to purchase is their ultra matte liquid
lipsticks so this is like the packaging
that it comes in a bit of a bigger
package than the lippie Stix but I got
four different shades to show you guys
the first one that I have to share is
MIDI and thought that is midi right
there this is midi i swatched on my hand
the website describes it as a soft
neutral beige it definitely is it does
kind of remind me a little bit of the
cookie lippy stick except it's a little
bit more on the pink side versus the
brown side it's like such a soft almost
like icy pink on the lips it's gorgeous
I wore it alone with my wine maybelline
lip liner I've worn it with Worrell from
Mac as a lip liner I mean it's just
absolutely gorgeous it's just it's so
pretty this is this is probably one of
my favorites in the order that i did and
i just think it's gorgeous it comes
everywhere with me because again i think
it's really pretty that you can wear it
to something like work or a family event
but you put a little bit of a darker lip
liner on there and then it kind of
brings out something extra and you can
wear it on right out I just love this
one so much next one I have is sallow
and it is what I'm wearing on my lips
right now so that is what sallow looks
like it's described on the website a
neutral new
pink I honestly think it's got a little
bit more oomph to be called neutral
that's right here I mean you can see it
on my lips right now it's definitely a
darker pink is just a little bit of a
darker pink but I I mean definitely
still on the neutral side it's not dark
it's not really flashy but it's not neon
it's not bright it's just such a good
cool pink color I think it's absolutely
gorgeous I do think it's going to be a
good one for the fall and the between
this one and many like these are my
favorite they're the ones that I assumed
would be my favorite they're more like
the color that I we're on an everyday
basis but both of them they just come
with me everywhere because i think they
are so gorgeous this one that i have is
bumble i bought it because i saw online
that people were saying it was like the
kylie jenner lip color which i know a
lot of people are like so over hearing
that but i really like that lip color so
when I heard that I was like oh yeah you
know I'll give it a try so this is
bumble and honestly was pretty different
than I thought it was going to be on the
website it describes it a dusty warm
terracotta which was interesting so that
is bumble I honestly think when I first
put it on and like how I first swash it
on my hand when it's still wet I think
it's too dark for me like when I first
looked at myself after putting this on I
was like oh I don't really think I like
that at all and then I let it dry to the
matte finish and then I liked it so much
more than I was really happy with it
honestly it's not what I it's not what
comes to mind when I think of the kylie
jenner lip color to be honest it's a
little bit darker and redder than i
think is what the kylie jenner lip color
is but maybe I'm wrong maybe maybe I'm
wrong it definitely could be wrong I
don't know if you've been able to notice
that it's dried at all it doesn't really
take very long for these to dry also by
the way but I just thought it looks a
lot better once it actually is the mat
dry finish on your lips then I thought
it looked really pretty haven't really
worn a lot of lip liners with this
sometimes I wear the wine but that's
about it usually I just wear
plane with no lip liner and I think it
looks fine one thing that I will say
about these liquid lipsticks is I don't
think you need a lip liner with any of
them like when I where the melted
lipsticks from Too Faced I need a lip
liner or else they just feather out and
bleed everywhere and the lip liner
really helps make sure that lipstick
doesn't go anywhere on my lips but with
these I don't think you thought you need
a lip liner with any of the colors that
I've had so far myself I don't think you
need a lip liner with them I also think
the lasting power is crazy good like
I've eaten a burrito with this and I
won't say it was like I you couldn't
notice that I eaten anything because I
think the color definitely faded a
little bit but not to the point where I
needed to like run to the bathroom and
apply another layer I thought it held up
really well it's so nice to be able to
like drink out of a straw or drink a
glass while you're wearing this and not
have it come off on your glass or your
straw I think that's so amazing so
that's a one thing that I just really
really love about these last one that I
have to share with you is limbo and
limbo was definitely like my big big
wild card that when I do these swatch
videos I always want to try to get
something outside of my comfort zone to
share with you guys because I know that
you know we have different skin tones we
have different taste than what we like
etc I don't always just want to be
purchasing the same like pinks and light
Pink's every single time so I try to
throw a few wild ones in there and that
limbo was definitely it because this is
a deep chocolate brown color so that is
what it looks like so wash on my hand
definitely very different I did do one
video wearing it I think it was my tan
towel review video I wore it and was
like what do you guys think and everyone
was so nice that you were commenting and
you know putting on Instagram that you
really liked it I was like oh okay thank
you guys and I actually felt confident
enough to post a selfie on facebook and
be like hey brown lips and people again
were so nice I was like okay thank you
for not like slaughtering me because I
think this is the first time ever in my
life I've worn brown lipstick I liked it
a lot more than I thought I was going to
I thought this was going to have to be
something that you know I really
couldn't wear I didn't even know if I
going to be confident enough to wear it
in a video and I I ended up really
liking it and once again this is going
to be perfect for fall I mean Brown how
much more fall does that get so I
actually think you are going to be
seeing me where this more and more
because I ended up really really liking
it so there it is again so watched on my
hand now that it's dry to the mat and I
think it's not just so cool I think it's
really cool so I was really really
impressed with this color I'm not going
to lie I i mean really i was impressed
with every color i liked all of them i
will continue to wear all of them yes of
course i have a few of my favorites
because that's how everything is right
we always have our favorites but overall
i was so happy with all the colors that
i got and I'm excited to make another
those are all the swatches and my
reviews and feedback on my first color
pop hall I hope you guys liked all of
these shades and I mean can you guys see
that I'm like rubbing my hand over these
ultra matte liquid lipsticks and like
nothing's happening they're not smudging
they're not moving I mean isn't that so
cool so just imagine that on your lips
it's not going to go anywhere it is so
so nice they'll ultra matte liquid
lipsticks I don't know if I said this
yet but they are only six dollars six
dollars I mean again like with the
lippie Stix being five dollars these are
only six dollars the lasting power is
great how they dry on your lips is great
I did not have a problem i will say the
very first liquid lipstick that i tried
i felt like it was really dry my lips
and i was like oh this is just kind of a
weird feeling like I kept feeling like I
had to lick my lips and like kind of rub
them together like oh this is so bizarre
and after that I don't know it was like
I got used to it and it does not bother
me at all anymore I think I just
understand the feeling I get what's
happening on my lips but I don't feel
the need to lick my lips anymore like
rub them together I really don't even
notice the lipstick is on which is so
incredible so I think being that was my
first time ever putting on liquid
lipstick it just kind of caught me off
guard for a second because liquid
lipsticks are drying I mean they just
they really are so I've watched a lot of
different review videos on a
lot of different brands and products and
liquid lipsticks and you know that's
kind of the method behind a liquid
lipstick is that it's going to be a
little bit drying on your lips but not
to the point where it bothered me
sometimes just when I take off the lip
liquid lipstick which by the way I need
to take them off with a makeup remover
wipe I mean you can't just like put
water on and expect it to go away
because it's not going to but after I
take the makeup remover and put it off a
lot of times I just put on like a
chapstick or a lip gloss which most
nights I do anyways I usually wear like
a chapstick to bed because that's I
don't know that's just what I do so um
that's just a little piece about that
but I think that's all I have to say so
there are only six dollars for the ultra
matte and definitely be ordering more I
really have my eye on deeper right now
I've heard that it's that dupe for the
veronica from Anastasia Beverly Hills so
I'm like mmm think I need you but again
I'm just so impressed with color pop
this is definitely like a brand that i
know i'm going to keep purchasing from
and you know keep my eye on because i
think they have so many cool things
going on i love their website it's very
easy to navigate their Instagram always
has cool things on it I'll leave links
to the colour-pop website and Instagram
below direct links to all of the
products that I mentioned in this video
I hope you guys enjoyed it I was so
excited to make this one because I've
just been the loving so much on the
colour-pop lipsticks I just keep wearing
them I love the blushes I'm wearing them
almost every single day so excited to
get more they did just put out a fall
collection which looks absolutely
beautiful they have blushes and
eyeshadows and lipsticks all based
around fall and I think their theme was
like 90s I don't know those 90s grunge
or just 90s in general but there's
really fun names out there like beepers
one of them clueless is another one
never been kissed and you know for
someone who grew up in the 90s I'm like
that's so much fun so I think the next
order that I place will probably be
pretty soon because had my eye on a lot
of different things I know I've already
