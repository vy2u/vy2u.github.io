video I am super excited for because I
finally got my colour-pop box in the
mail so I'm going to be doing a
colour-pop haul but it's gonna be a try
on haul clearly because I've got a
handful of different things so I thought
we could just try them on together and
kind of create a flow face so I did pick
up you know filter foundation that was
kind of the driving force behind my
colour-pop haul so I got the foundation
I also picked up a new shade of the no
filter concealer because they concealer
that I first picked up is way too light
for me and I can't use it as a concealer
so maybe we got a better match I don't
know I also picked up one of their new
face duos I was talking about this in
one of my recent lullaby videos and I
said I wanted to try one out so it
picked one up and then also one thing
that I've been eyeing for a while and
was waiting for it to come back in stock
and it did is the perception that
palette in collaboration with makeup
Shayla so I have a lot to put on my face
today I have some shadows to put on my
eyes so I'm really excited for this
trying haul so when we go ahead and get
started alright it's very zoomed in got
my ears on I don't have any makeup on
except for my face primer and I used the
elf of poreless face primer I've been
trying this one out recently I really do
like it and so that is the primer that I
have on I am gonna do my face first it's
just kind of what I'm feeling today and
so of course I'm going to use the new no
filter foundation you pick up the shade
light 75 there is 42 different shades
and I really I really tried hard trying
to figure out which one I should go for
I don't really know if this will be a
good match for me or not hopefully so
light 75 on the colour-pop website it
says it's a neutral foundation with
peachy undertones for light to medium
skin so fingers crossed foundation is a
$12 so the packaging looks like it does
have a pump it is glass as well comes in
42 different shades this is 0.85 fluid
ounces it's supposed to be full coverage
and also have a matte finish and like a
blurring finish for your skin as well
I'm going to use a Beauty Blender so I
was a little bit nervous about the color
pop on day
because I don't prefer matte or full
coverage foundations I'm more of like a
medium Lumi kind of girl but I was like
go ahead and give it a shot twelve
dollars isn't too bad and I know a lot
of people were really excited for this
this is colourpop's first foundation but
typically if I'm going to do matte and
full coverage I'm going to apply it with
a damp Beauty Blender and it kind of
helps a shear out the coverage just just
a little bit and it just makes me feel a
little bit more more confident so it
came out a lot more liquidy than I was
expecting actually really when I hear
like matte and full coverage I think of
like kind of a thicker foundation but
we'll just go ahead and see so I'm just
gonna kind of dot it around my face
first and then start to blend it in
shape back she doesn't look crazy bad
right away I do my ring light on because
it is storming once again today boo it
really is seeming to cover really well I
had a lot of redness around my mouth and
I covered it like immediately Wow okay I
blend out my forehead here ooh get it in
the hair perfect just washed it love it
I'm also gonna blend down on my neck it
does appear to be in personnel is it
appears to be a pretty good match for me
I still had a pretty exciting I have it
pretty much all blended out onto my face
you know obviously this is the first
impression I'll come back and do a
follow up with everything that I'm gonna
try on my face today from colour-pop and
let you guys know after I try it out and
you know wear it a couple different
times and all that good stuff but but
how first impression I'm actually I'm
actually pretty impressed that really
covered everything and that was just one
pass I did about two and a half to three
pumps and I'm just really quite
impressed by how much that I covered up
Wow
usually like a lot of times with
foundations I'll you know I apply one
layer to my face and I'll come back and
put a little bit more product on and I
put it around my mouth because that's
what I deal with the most breakouts and
so then I do it again to kind of cover
it up but that did a really solid job
I'm so
I don't notice it like sitting anywhere
like crazy weird yet or anything like
that but also just kind of right off the
bat is that it feels very lightweight
that's another thing when it comes to
more full coverage foundations I feel
like I have so much makeup on my face I
feel like it's very heavy I feel like
it's very cakey and I do not feel that
at all with this this feels so light
weight on me Wow I'm very impressed I
mean it does definitely look more matte
on my skin as well but it's nothing like
too matte I don't feel like cake face
don't far so good with the foundation
I'm liking the match so far the color
matches so far again I was late 75 hey
I'm pretty impressed so that's awesome
why don't we just go ahead and move on
to the concealer that's what I'm really
curious about how the shade matches well
for my concealer this is the no filter
concealer from colour-pop this is a $6 I
won't want the shade medium 20 this time
and it says this is a neutral cool
concealer for medium skin tones the one
that I have prior is like light 15 or
something like that and it's like so
like I normally would not do a medium
concealer because I like lighter under
eyes I'm usually in the like family but
that was a no-go I literally only use
that concealer for like cutting the
crease and stuff like that so let's go
ahead and give this one a try and see if
we have a better luck and I can actually
use it as a concealer that is still
pretty light wow that is really freaking
wild to me it's a way better though it's
a way better I'm gonna bring some on my
eyelids to attack as my eyelid primer
I'm gonna take my same sponge this is
from a company I'll have it linked down
below
it's sigma beauty's like sister company
it starts with a P but I'm not sure how
to pronounce it and I actually quite
like they're sponges which is wild to me
because the new like Sigma Beauty redid
their 3d HD sponge and I used to love it
and now I don't really love it as much
but these are actually really nice so
I'm just gonna take that and blend that
out okay I feel like I can actually work
with this color it's still later than I
expect it but
it'll actually work on me so that's
that's good news that's good news I can
finally actually test out the color
public concealer because the color match
was so wrong with me last time I'm like
I look ridiculous I can't actually
review this concealer which was a bummer
but this one it's looking pretty good
so it's blending out really easily and
once again I feel like it covered really
well I mean look at that difference
between my eyes like you can see that
this eye is dealing with a lot of
redness this eye are looking good it's
concealing who feeling much better about
life at this moment feel much better the
same thing on the other side
I like the applicators on these it is
like that flat applicator it's flat on
each side and it's really bendy as well
which i think is helpful so I'm gonna
just take my sponge and blend out this
side so usually I would take my
concealer and cover up any other areas
that need it but honestly I don't think
I really have to do that at this moment
umm it's looking pretty good down here
thanks to that foundation so um that's
pretty cool I think the concealer is
looking really good so far it blended
out really easily color matches so much
better I can already tell that I'm
getting some creasing on my under eyes
so I'm gonna go ahead and set it with a
powder quickly so we cannot look like a
crazy mess most of the day but it felts
it's not a super thick concealer but
it's also not like super like thin and
runny and those typically start creasing
on me right away so I'm a little
surprised to see those creases so fast
I'm gonna go ahead and use a powder and
set the concealer on my under eyes
sometimes I've been powdering my face
with a finishing powder like the
covergirl or Charlotte Tilbury or Urban
Decay all nighter I'm gonna go ahead and
skip that for today it's not something
that I do every single time and because
I want to see how the foundation kind of
reacts on its own I'm going to go ahead
and skip the powder for that but my
camera is gonna overheat so I'm gonna
let it cool down I'm gonna set my under
eyes and I'm also going to fill in my
brows before I come back
alrighty so I did just put some powder
on the concealer and then I used the
color
brow pencil this is the colour-pop brow
pencil in taupe taupe it's not a great
color brush for me it's a little bit too
dark and just like a hint on the auburn
side but these pencils are like so BAM
pigmented that like if you screw up like
it is going to it's gonna show and it's
just slightly hard for me to work what I
still like these but I wouldn't
repurchase another one because there's
other ones I just think are a little
more user-friendly are you girl here but
that is what I use to fill in my brows
so before I start the eyes I am just
gonna go ahead and use this house of
mirrors face duo so I've been wanting to
try a color pop face duo for a while
because I've heard really good things
about there ones in the past so when
they came out with these new guys I was
like Melissa's gonna try so I got the
one in house of mirrors it's $10 it does
come with a mirror and it also has a
bronzer powder and then a highlight as
well so go ahead and grab my Sigma f30
brush to bronze and see how we do the
foundation I was looking at they don't
get definitely dried down like even more
max like once they completely settled in
and I was like okay I can definitely
notice that it's very matte so I would
probably use like either a Beauty oil
underneath this foundation I really
hydrating primer and then also have but
definitely I mean I I use this I think
spray every day but I would use
something that's maybe a little bit more
on the you know hydrating the side with
a matte foundation because that is just
what I prefer okay so the bronzer
appears to be going on pretty smoothly I
am just taking my time and building it
up but so far I like the color of that
but I was also like really trying to
look closely at my skin like around my
nose and give my chin and all of that
and just seeing if I noticed anything
like settling into any lines anywhere
like especially on my forehead I can
have some lines up there notice anything
so so far so good I'll be curious to see
how it wears as well and like
I said I'll be sure to come back and do
a full review on it but have you guys
purchased it I think I feel like a lot
of people made an order for it as well
guys thinking of it so far I'm just
gonna go ahead and also brings up my
forehead so so far so good so they have
three new face deals on here and this
one to me was kind of like the middle
guy and I feel like for my skin tone the
bronzer worked pretty well I did have to
build it up so it is on the lighter side
but it's nothing that I couldn't work
with so so far it's so good for that I'm
just gonna pop on a little bit of blush
I'm going to use the blush from a collab
beauty and then after that I'm going to
pick out the highlight so I'm just gonna
swatch it first
that feels very feels very smooth so
let's give it a swatch so here is what
the highlight looks like it looks pretty
it looks kind of softer then you know
sometimes I'm very into like bleeding
highlights sometimes most the time but
we'll go ahead and see so I'm going to
use my Sigma F of three and apply okay
that's more that has more to it than I
thought it is super super soft on my
skin wow that feels nice
okay so that's more Bellinis than I
thought it was going to be and it's a
really smooth highlight like it's not
it's not powdery at all it's not like
any sort of like chunky or anything it
doesn't have any glitter in it mm-hmm I
think that looks really nice I don't
pick up any extra product but I'm just
gonna kind of like tap above my forehead
here I usually do this when I'm using a
matte foundation as well again just to
bring like a little bit of luminosity
and then I'm gonna tap just a really
small amount and I'm gonna run it down
the center of my nose and then also just
on the tip of my nose nothing too crazy
though ooh I actually really like that
highlight when I swatch it does kind of
like mmm okay but oh I do like that okay
so good good first impression on the
house of mirrors as well okay so now
that the face is done I'm finally gonna
move over to the eye
so I'm using the perception eyes shadow
palette in collaboration with makeup
Shayla I'm really excited about this I
put this in a will about video inside
was planning on purchasing it the day
that I went to purchase it it wasn't the
day of the launch but it's just a couple
days later I felt like it sold out like
an hour before I was on the colour-pop
site I was like dang it
but then once the foundation came out I
was like I'm gonna get that palette if
it's also in stock when I go to buy the
foundation so I'm really excited that it
was so I'm sure you guys have already
seen it there's been a ton of tutorials
with this palette but all of the
tutorials were really impressing me as
well all the looks that people were
coming up with it's a very heavy palette
like it feels very legit and has a
mirror which is awesome and then we have
all these different shades in here it's
gonna take the sticky off the mirror so
I can see myself the shades look so
pretty and I really haven't decided what
are those that I want to uh what I want
to do today and it does have names on
the palette as well underneath each of
the different shades there is the name
also the palette doesn't have like a
mattes
you know like a lighter shade so I just
went ahead and applied one from another
palette to kind of set the concealer on
my eyes as well I'm not gonna do
anything super crazy today as I've been
doing so many different I looks
throughout the week and like multiple
ilex that I feel like my eyes are just
like slightly bothered with all the or
who have been putting them through last
week so I'm gonna do something just
fairly simple so first I'm gonna take
the shade cultured I'm use the Sigma
e-40 and I'm just going to blend that
into the crease that shows up right away
it looks nice I'm gonna pick up a
smaller brush this is the e25 and I'm
gonna come in with the shade revenge
down here and I'm just going to add this
to the outer part of my eye and then
slowly blend it into the crease keeping
it just a little bit lower than that
first shade and really focusing most of
it on the outer part that looks really
pretty as well
I'm just gonna add just a little bit
more and then blend it out again since
it is a bit of a darker color I'm just
gonna kind of take my time and build it
up but that looks really nice and it's
really easy to blend back and forth so
many times on what it is that I want to
do but I think I know now so I'm gonna
grab a sum of plate out and then a
smaller brush this is the e45 from sigma
and i'm gonna work this right on the
outer part of my eye and silver so I was
gonna go with the green and then I was
gonna go with the purple and then I
decided to do more of a rose gold look
and I remember watching a tutorial from
I love Sarah II and I love the look that
she did so I just pulled up her video
and rewatched it and I was like we're
gonna try to do something similar to
that she's beautiful so look just go
ahead and see how we do but I'm just
gonna kind of place that color onto the
outer part of my eye and then I'm going
to grab the e25 that I used with revenge
and I'm just going to blend that on the
outer part of the eye impressed with how
well everything is blending even some of
these two darker shades like Megan
Marvel hello even some of these darker
shades are blending really well for me
like I'm just not having to take a lot
of time and work with them a lot so
that's awesome because I'm not a
professional makeup blender and
sometimes especially when I'm filming I
just feel very rushed because my camera
overheats after like 15 minutes so I'm
like whew trying to hurry and all that
so okay okay
hmm so next I'm going to put a little
concealer into the crease so I'm going
to use this one here which was in light
neutral of 15 so if you can see the
difference between my two colors like
clearly there's quite quite a color
difference there so like I said I've
just been using this one to like cut the
crease I'm gonna use my Sigma F 70 brush
so I'm just gonna go ahead and put the
concealer like in the middle of my lid
and then market towards the inner part
as well it may be something a little
like that's not the best I can see the
replacement but I'm trying so I'm just
gonna spray a brush with some fix+ this
is the Sigma e-40 8 and then I'm going
to pick up the shade spill the tea
I'm gonna put that everywhere where I
placed the concealer I think I missed a
step I think she blended the concealer
out first but just we'll just go with it
and see how we do that is a really
pretty rose gold eyeshadow is so easy to
pack on and look how like wow that looks
really good just started to get like the
smallest amount of fallout from that
shimmer but nothing too much I'm not too
concerned so I'm gonna grab just like a
tiny amount of revenge on the e25
and kind of blend the edges over here
like the way that looks she did a wing
and lashes and hers but like I said I
have been putting on makeup and removing
it and putting on makeup like almost
every single day for the past five days
and my eyelids hurt so I don't think I'm
gonna do that I think I'll just do
mascara but I think that looks pretty
darn good a little bit of pure liner
into my waterline so to finish off the
look I think I'm first gonna go in with
revenge and the Sigma pencil brush and
I'm going to work that really close to
the lash line I'm gonna use the same
brush and I'm going to come in with
which was this one culture culture that
brown and then use that one to really
kind of smudge out the first shadow then
I'm going to add a little bit of
unbothered into the inner corner finish
it off so that's where I'm going to
leave the eyes I'm gonna add a little
bit of mascara this is the new one from
milk makeup the push mascara been
testing it out cuz my review might
follow a video from my latest haul is
coming up so far so good on the
perception palette I'm really impressed
with that that took me like no time to
do that I look no time at all even the
blending and I use some of those darker
shades this has me pretty pumped now I
only did use a handful of shades so I'll
definitely be trying some other ones
that green I'm really interested in some
of these goals I think are really
beautiful too so yeah I have a lot of
different ideas with this palette but
let me know if you'd like to see
something else for my Instagram tutorial
but I'm
press it back okay so I add some mascara
and then I also did that spray my face
with a bit of my fix plus as well so I'm
just gonna finish it off with a lip
color figured I would do one from
colour-pop as well this is one of their
Lux lipsticks in still crazy I've tried
a couple of their Lux lipsticks I don't
love them but this one is my favorite
color
so I'm gonna go ahead and play this
alright so this is the final look that I
came up with doing my try on haul with
my latest at color pop order so to run
through everything first of all why am i
the messiest person when it comes to
foundation the no filter foundation
actually has me pretty impressed I can
definitely tell that it's matte on my
skin like I was saying so I would just
kind of you know come in with the
primers that I mentioned and make sure
to spray my face but so far I'm really
impressed at how full coverage that was
that covered everything I didn't need a
lot of foundation and it still feels
really good on the skin I've been
sitting here for over an hour now and it
still feels really good on the skin it
doesn't feel any sort of cakey or heavy
and it hasn't been sitting weird or
settling into lines or anything like
that yet so I'll keep an eye on it
throughout the day and yeah I'm excited
to see how it holds up so so far so good
on the no filter foundation now the no
filter concealer I'm not quite as
impressed with because it definitely was
creasing pretty bad on my under eyes I
did a smoke out the lower lash line you
know a bit and it helped kind of cover
those creases but it crease right away
as I was applying it and then even after
I put a powder on I still felt like I
was getting quite a bit of creasing
we'll have to go ahead out to try this a
few more times and see what I think I'm
just glad I got a color match that I can
do that with the house of mirrors
palette I'm pretty happy with the
bronzer I just have to work with a
little bit but the highlight was I think
this is called was the main attraction
really is like the main attraction I was
gonna say it's like the star of the show
but that highlight is freaking gorgeous
and again this duo is $10 so for a
bronzer and a highlighter that's not bad
in a mirror and it's nice and compact to
travel with pretty happy with that one
so far but honestly I mean this in the
foundation has me most impressed I think
the perception palette with makeup
Shayla so far so good on this
I felt like I was not sitting here for
as long as I thought I was going to
because it was so simple to work with
those shadows you know I did a fairly
simple look but I still used you know I
had a little different shadows but I
feel like it went really well
I think seem to be pretty darn pigmented
that spill the tea shimmer is so
beautiful but yeah I had a great time
working with us so I'm excited to give
it another try I really like the
packaging I like the mirror this is $23
I believe if I didn't say so I'm excited
I'm excited to finally get my hands on
it so so far I feel like it's went
pretty darn good I'll be back in a
couple weeks of course I can give my
reviews on everything but yeah first
impression I have to say that I'm pretty
happy overall with my new colour-pop
hull so I would love to know if you did
pick up the new foundation did you order
anything else with it
do let me know but other than that
that's gonna do it for today's video if
you enjoyed it and you enjoyed seeing a
try on haul style video please do let me
know or give this video a thumbs up I
hope that you'll also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
