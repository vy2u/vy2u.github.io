today's video is going to be a lip
swatch video we are going to be a lip
swatching the color pop just peachy lip
set so it comes with three of the
colour-pop lippie z' we have an
instigator which is anna matte finish
screen shot which is in a satin finish
and speed dial which isn't another matte
finish so I picked these up during the
Cyber Monday sale and when I shared them
in my video I got a lot of requests to
do swatches on them so I thought I would
go ahead and do it I know this video was
a little bit behind there is probably
other videos out there watching these
ones as well but I thought I would still
do it just because I had so many
comments come in asking to do it so I
wanted to get it done the color pop
order was super super delayed it was
like it took two weeks or something to
get to me it was a while and they were
really nice and they actually sent in a
couple of like mini lip glosses as an
apology because color popping that they
relate to so that's why this video is
coming later as well but I wanted to
still do it ah the just peachy bundle is
still in stock on the colour-pop website
but also I believe the three lippies
inside are also for sale individually
like anytime I'm not sure they're
limited edition it didn't say that they
were on the website but not only is the
bundle available but you can purchase
the individual lipsticks as well so if
you like any one of these or two of them
but you don't want to get the bundle you
can purchase them individually so
they'll be linked down below you just do
get a bit of a discount if you get the
bundle do I believe the ultra matte and
the ultra satins are six dollars apiece
so it'd be eighteen dollars for three
but you can get the bundle for $15 so
you save a couple of dollars so that's
good I've decided to go with the bundle
because this packaging it's a really
cute packaging okay also I really do
like how the shades looked I looked at
them on the website they seemed like
what I like to wear and like the peach
craze of course everybody is super into
the peach craze the Too Faced sweet
peach palette just came back in stock
I'm wearing it on my eyes today I'm
having a sick day so this is like as
much as I can muster up with myself but
I'm trying I'm trying but I wanted to
try all three I just thought it would be
fun and I thought the bundle was super
cute so there's that
I also am going to be having a little
giveaway that all announced at the end
of the video so stay tuned for that but
when I go ahead and get into the
swatches of the colour-pop Just Peachy
flip bundle okay so first up I'm going
to try instigator it's one of the ultra
matte lips and it is a muted peach
according to the website so color pop
came out with I think there lippie stix
were first I have a couple of those I
think they're just great then they came
out with the ultra matte lips and I
tried them and at first I was like yes I
love these but the more like liquid
lipsticks I tried I was like mmm not
sure if I'm the biggest thing on that
formula because it's super drying and
can get pretty crumbly on the lips but I
recently was sent perky from colour-pop
it's one of their holiday lip colors and
I was scented to review from actively I
mentioned it in my last haul video as
well and I was actually super super
impressed with that formula it was so
much better than what I've been trying
in the past so I'm very curious to see
if this formula is going to be the same
like I'm very curious so again this is
instigator okay so there is instigator
swatch on my hand that looks beautiful
okay and then let's try the lips
okay so here is instigator on my list I
really like this one you guys let me
look at the mirror again mm-hmm I really
like this one this would be like an
everyday type of color for me and it
feels really nice it feels like the
holiday one which really excites me and
it's so hard for me to explain what I
feel like this formula is like now it's
almost like when you put it on your lips
it's almost like it's hard to drag the
applicator along your lips because it is
so quick drying like by the time you
swipe once across your lips it feels
like that formula is already drying and
you need to like be really really quick
with your application like do not mess
around when you are applying these so
that's what this one feels like as well
so I have really high hopes that these
are going to be just like the perky ones
and just be super long-lasting and also
very very comfortable oh that's super
excites me you guys like I said I mean I
just applied this and they are already
completely dry they're completely
transfer proof I'm really impressed so
it appears that colour-pop has revamped
their ultra matte formulas I'm impressed
with it so far this one an instigator I
just think is beautiful mmm mmm loving
it okay next up we are going to try
speed-dial which is described as a rich
peach let me tell you that first one was
not easy to get off my lips these are
I'm I'm really really happy with this
formula you guys with this latest change
I think it's really good and for only
six dollars like I might be going back
to ordering from colour-pop like every
other week now so here is the second one
this is in speed dial so it was funny
because like as you are looking at them
and even as I look at them on the tube
they look really really similar but I
mean this one is still drying of course
but you can already tell that it's going
to be very different when we go ahead
and put this one on the lips
okay here is speed dial on the lips so
you can see it's much darker and richer
in color than the first one this one is
really nice too I wouldn't consider this
of like an everyday color because it is
a little bit on the darker side but it's
still a beautiful beautiful shade so far
we are two for two and I'm really
excited because these colors just like
speak to me mm yep I'm really liking
this one as well and again same thing
with the formula I just applied it
already completely dried map transfer
proof I mean this is looking pretty good
you guys I really do like this color mmm
this is pretty okay so that one was
speed dial and let's go ahead and move
on to the last shade okay and then the
last one that we have is in screen shot
this is described as a deepened peach
and this is an ultra satin lip so I do
own a couple of the ultra satin lips I
immediately like this formula better
than the altar mattes that I had tried
because it was super similar to the
ultra matte formula except it was much
much more comfortable on the lips I
didn't do as much of like the crumbly
inner lip thing and again just way more
comfortable than the ultra mattes that I
had tried with the new ultra matte
formula I feel like it's on par with the
ultra satin so I don't know we'll see so
here we go here is the last one that was
in screenshot so you can see the
difference in them all here I would
definitely say the two that are most
similar are these ones right here this
one is still drawing so I do need to
give it a little bit of time but this
one definitely is a standout on its own
but these two are the different formulas
so again we'll see what that one looks
like dry and almost looks like maybe
it's going to be lighter but I'm not
sure it needs to dry but while it's
drying why don't we go ahead and put it
on the lips and see what it looks like
so this one I definitely feel is like
that everyday type of peach color as
well if we look at the swatches again on
my hand I mean you can see now that
there definitely is a difference between
the two I would say actually the first
one is definitely more of a kind of like
a deeper type of peach and the other one
is more lighter I would say and you have
to keep in mind that they are different
formulas as well so with the alter
statins they don't dry down completely
matte they're like super super close to
it but there still is a tiny bit of
transfer that can happen so that's
really the only difference that I've
seen between the ultra mattes and the
ultra statins
while the ultra statins are super close
to the ultra matte formula they are more
comfortable I think on the lips
not quite as drying and they will
transfer a little bit it's not like a
regular lipstick or a creamy lipstick
where like you'll get like the full
transfer is going on you know it after a
while and after you let it dry down a
while it is mostly matte but there still
is that little tiny smidgen of transfer
that can happen so that is the
difference between the ultra mattes and
the ultra sentence that I've seen with
the new revamped formula of the ultra
matte I'm not sure if the ultra satin
has changed I will test this one out
today and see what I think but that is
what I've seen in the past from using
the ultra matte and the ultra satin from
colour-pop okay so I just kissed my hand
as you can see there is some transfer
but those were kind of the differences
that I've seen between the ultra man the
ultra satin two still very good formulas
I think from colour-pop and it's six
dollars for all of them it's something
that I feel like cannot be beat
especially with the revamping of the
ultra matte formula which I just think
is absolute key I'm actually curious to
see now if I like that formula better
than I like the satin ones because the
satin ones have been my current faves so
we will see what happens I'll be testing
them out and being able to give a full
review here shortly but I am very happy
because I really liked all three shades
on my lips I thought all of them looked
great I don't know if I have a favorite
I'm like looking at the swatches to try
to like remind myself again I mean these
two I just think are really good for
like everyday neutral type of colors and
this one I kind of liked when you wanted
to like jazz your look up a bit or spice
it up a little bit I really
like to that second one so overall I'm
super happy with the gist PG bundle from
colour-pop I'm really happy that I
decided to get it not only was it $15 so
you're saving a little bit then buying
these individually but then I also
purchased them at Cyber Monday so I got
and goes 20% off as well so I'm excited
about it three new lippies dies my
collection just what I need because I
should like don't have any lipsticks
that is a lie that is a bold-faced lie
right there really I'm very happy with
this purchase
I like color pop I wish that things
weren't always as limited-edition our
limited quantity that color pop usually
does that's usually what holds me back
from purchasing from them but I was
excited to see the bundle is still in
stock but then also you can get the
individual lipsticks so maybe if you saw
one and you thought it looked great you
can go ahead and purchase it for only $6
on the Claire pop website the bundle and
all of the individual lippies will be
