today's video is going to be a new
makeup tutorial on this kind of like
cranberry bull smoky makeup look and it
is using the modern renaissance palette
from Anastasia Beverly Hills I recently
did a first impression and swatch video
on this I can leave it linked down below
I was so excited to finally get my hands
on it and a lot of people said that they
wanted to see a makeup tutorial with it
so that is what I did today I know it's
not quite like how would i look I mean
if you're going for like a bold bold
holiday cranberry look this can
definitely be it but I did want to get
out a makeup tutorial using this so
that's why I went with this one today
this look is totally inspired by carli
bybel and her cranberry I look that she
recently came out with I was watching
her video the other day and she used
this palette and I was like oh my gosh I
just love the way that she did that I
look so I definitely took a lot of
inspiration from that look it's not an
exact recreation I kind of did my own
thing with it but super inspired by
Carly's look so I will leave her video
down below if you want to check it out
if you haven't already this is going to
be just an eye makeup look the reason
being for that if you don't follow me on
snapchat you should I'm Samantha dat
March but my snap family lot of updates
over there but I'm having laptop issues
and I currently cannot record any
voiceover something is wrong with my
speakers I don't know what it is but
it's affecting my voice overs I learned
that when I was doing the Instagram vs
real life makeup challenge that
something's very wrong there and so I
can't do voice overs so to do a talk
through tutorial definitely takes more
time I did a full like full face talk
through tutorial video and those just
take a little bit longer so I thought
until I can get my laptop fixed I can
kind of go back and forth between a full
face talk through and then just an eyes
talk through just to make sure that my
videos aren't getting like too long or
too repetitive so it is all focused on
this I look today then I also show you
the lip that I use as well but I did
just want to point that out I know that
I've done two very Boulder type of looks
here on my channel since I have
reintroduced doing tutorials more I mean
this is my second one so I've been like
whoa
well but I do have a third one in mind
and it will definitely be more of like a
simple classic glam to paw they look and
I'm really excited to film that one so
that will be coming soon but i'm really
excited to start doing tutorials again
and yeah i'm just having fun with it i
had a lot of fun playing with this
palace today i think it is beautiful and
gorgeous and amazing and thank you to
Carly for the inspiration but if you
would like to see how I got this a
cranberry eye makeup look please keep
watching so my eyes are already primed
and ready to go so we are using the
modern renaissance palette from
Anastasia Beverly Hills so first I'm
just going to pick up my morphe m4 for
one it's just a big fluffy blending
brush and I'm going to come into the
shade of raw Sienna right here on the
end and just blend this into my crease
and using the same brush I'm going to
grab some of realgar it's a really
pretty orange color I really like this
one and I'm going to do that just
basically the same thing that I did with
raw Sienna just blending it into the
crease I'm going to focus this one more
on getting it on the outer V first like
a good amount on the outer V and then
I'll slowly bring that one in as well
I mean you can tell with these shades
you don't need to pick up a lot of
product as their self it meant it I
definitely picked up too much of real
guard but that's okay you can blend it
out and just work with it but yeah these
shades are super super pigmented you do
not need to get a lot on your brush
I'm going to grab a smaller blending
brush my morphe m4 33 and a little bit
of cyprus number right here and just
again just need a little bit of this
product and i'm going to focus this one
on the outer v of my eye so again just
placing it really lightly again I hold
my brush towards the end to have really
light pressure and then I just slowly
blend away in circles and this is just
going to darken up that outer be a
little bit
I'm going to work it in towards the
center of the eye a little bit but i'm
not going to actually drag it in towards
the inner corner I want to keep this one
at the outer V
it's going to be depending on your
preference if you want to come in more
with more cypress ember darken it up for
you totally can you can do this as many
times as you want until you get it to
where your preferences when I'm doing
this I like to hold my brush flat as
opposed to having it like tipped up here
because I don't bring the shadow more up
towards the eyebrow so I have the brush
on its side and that's how I apply it
for when I want to keep it like more
focused right here that's how I'll lay
the brush down and then just do the
circles to blend it in
then using the same brush again I'm
going to grab some Venetian red it's a
really pretty burgundy color with some
shimmer to it and I'm going to put this
one I'm going to start at the outer V
and then work my way into the middle
this one I am going to make just a
little bit on the sloppy side that's
what I did when I was first trying out
this look and I ended up really liking
it so again just start on the outer part
of your eyelid and then I'll work my way
in then even is kind of like in the
middle of my eyelid just kind of having
fun with this shade i like the little
bit of shimmer to it as well so i could
just kind of had had some fun playing
with this color and this is another one
where you can add more keep going in and
building it up until you get it to where
you want to be
because i'm working with like brighter
colors darker colors typically this
would be a look that I suggest doing
your eyes first and then following up
with your face makeup but because this
was just going to be an eye makeup
tutorial I figured I might as well do my
face first just to get that out of the
way but yeah normally if you're working
with you know a lot of colors dark
colors bright colors I definitely
suggest doing this first because then
you can easy or clean up like if you get
messy I mean I still will do that with
some concealer but normally it's just
easier to do this first and then move on
to your face
and then of course with this look I mean
you can added more orange you can add
more pink you can keep going back and
forth it just is whatever your
preferences but just to make note of
that you might see me throughout here
adding more orange adding more pink and
then blending everything in but just
until you get the shades to where you
personally want them so to create a wing
and use the Maybelline master precise
liner I am going to go for a boulder
weighing not super super bold like in my
last tutorial but still like we want to
let people know that we wanted to do a
wing that day so like usual I just draw
the line straight o'clock across first
and then work on my wing
once I have my line down then I'm going
to draw my line up and I draw it up
towards my eyebrow I just started about
three fourths of the way and bring it
back down this liner is like on its last
leg here it's almost out but we're gonna
make it work because my new liner has
not gone in here yet so then I just fill
it in
and I'm going to use my Vegas nay in I
lower lashes in Grand glamour because i
love these lashes are some of my
favorites and they're just super glam
super dramatic lashes so that is what
they look like again I just love them
and I'm going to apply them with my duo
dark tone adhesive I always recommend
using a dark tone for your eyelash
adhesive it just will make your life so
much easier forgot again just like in
the last tutorial it almost be like
something with being on camera that I
forget this step but I'm just going to
take some of my roller lash mascara from
benefit and put that on my top lashes it
just helps blend your natural lashes and
the fake lashes a little bit and
especially when you're using more bolder
lashes it's a good step to remember if
again and once the adhesive is nice and
tacky I usually let mine dry for about
60 seconds then I just take it in my
tweezers and I come from the top and
place it onto the lash I press down the
middle first and then work on getting
the sides down
and then once I have them down I just
press on with my finger and then I'm
going to do the other side off camera
and then I will come back to finish up
with the s face you finish off the eyes
I'm first going to grab my color pop
liner and get paid they really pretty
metallic rose gold and I'm just obsessed
with this liner I use it all the time
it's going to place this into the water
line
and what I like to do when I've used
brushes and I views like multiple colors
on the brush what I do so I'm just going
to grab my m4 33 this is what I used
cyprus number on and then also the pink
shade as well I just take it and start
to lightly buff it along the lower lash
line and it just helps deposit some of
that same shades that we've been using
and then I just look at it and decide
what I want to do from there sometimes
it shows up bowmore sometimes it shows
up less but that's just normally what i
do first kind of like my first step you
don't let no I shadow product go to
waste here though then I'm going to do
is grab my morphe e36 it's just a small
detailed brush first going to pick up a
little bit of Cyprus number and focuses
mostly on the outer part of my lower
lash line and just sweep it across and
kind of bring it out like towards the
wing to like extend it along there and
then I'll pick up some real guard next
and sweep that along the lower lash line
this one I'm going to come through like
start at the end and sweep it nearly all
the way through not quite towards the
inner corner of the eye but most of the
way and then lastly I'll grab just a
little bit of the Venetian red and place
this like right in the center of the
lower lash line just for a little bit of
a pop of pink instead of before that I
really love a smoky lower lash line I
tend to go pretty heavy on my lower lash
line most of the time it's just what I
prefer so use as many or as little
shadows that you want on the lower lash
line this is a yarmulke book this
wondrous happens to be my makeup look
and then I'm just going to use my
benefit roller lash on my bottom lashes
so that is going to complete the i look
like i said i do of my face makeup on i
can leave that linked in the description
box down below I want to share the lip
colors i'm going to choose and that is
from hooter beauty and it is an
bombshell I kind of wanted to pair this
kind of Boulder I with more of a nude
lip and I just absolutely have been
loving on these huda liquid lipsticks I
just did a snatch it or scratch it on
them and I will leave that link down
below but seriously been loving these so
this one is just like a nice like kind
of nude subtle pink think it would
complement this book really well
and then once the lips are done I'm just
going to spray my face with some mac
fix+ to hold everything in place and
then this look is complete guys and this
is the final look I really hope that you
