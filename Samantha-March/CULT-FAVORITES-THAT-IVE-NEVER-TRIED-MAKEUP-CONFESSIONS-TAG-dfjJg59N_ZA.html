today's video is going to be the makeup
confessions tag talking about cult a
favorite makeup items that I have never
tried I saw my friend at Kelly post this
video and I thought it was such a fun
idea and then a lot of you guys were
asking me I was getting sent snapchats
of it asking me if I would did this
video and I was like oh yes yes I will
so I will have Kelly's channel linked
down below I highly suggest you to head
over there and subscribe to her because
she is an amazing Channel and we've
becoming very good friends which has me
very excited I will also link her video
down below if you want to click on that
it'll take you directly to her video and
you can see her cult favorite makeup
items that she has not tried but if you
want to see the ones that I have yet to
try let's go ahead and get on with the
confessions so I'm gonna kick it off
with a some eyeshadow pellets I would
love to know who here has been around my
channel for a while and who remembers me
always saying back in the day like I'm
not an eyeshadow palette junkie don't
really buy a lot of shadow palettes I
don't really see the need to have a lot
of different eyeshadow palettes anybody
else remember those days because
something changed something changed real
quick that means that there's a lot of
these kind of like cult favorite makeup
items and these like og eyeshadow
palettes especially that I have not
tried one of them or a couple of them
really is the lorac Pro palette I have
not tried any of like the lorac mega Pro
one two three all the way I think they
just released the fourth one I have not
tried any of them I hear really good
things about them
I actually didn't start trying lorac
until this year when I purchased the
brunch palette from them which was in
like early spring I want to say that was
the first time that I was trying lorac
cosmetics so I haven't tried any of the
and make a pro palettes I hear amazing
things about them maybe one day I'll do
it but I haven't yet another eyeshadow
palette a couple eyeshadow palettes that
I haven't tried is from Too Faced and
it's the chocolate bar palette I haven't
tried the original chocolate bar I think
there's a couple of different chocolate
bar palettes I haven't tried any of
those that the only one that I have
tried is the chocolate bon bons palette
I did have a subscriber to send that to
me and I really enjoy that palette but I
hear so many good things about the
original chocolate bars but I
never done it I don't know why you know
I'm on my break
currently with to face right now but
even you know a couple years ago and
everything I was always hearing really
good things about them but I never went
out and purchased any of the chocolate
bar palette so for myself I don't know
what it is but I just didn't do it so I
definitely think of the Too Faced
chocolate bar palettes would be
considered a cult favorite I've never
done it do you guys have the job of our
palates oh let me know so also the urban
decay naked palettes like the 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 I
believe is what they are I have not
tried any of those I did get the Urban
Decay Naked smoky as a Christmas gift I
did purchase the Urban Decay Naked heat
when it released and I ended up
returning it but those kind of original
cult favorites is what I would say those
original and naked palettes from Urban
Decay
I have not tried any of those have you
guys tried them have you only tried the
items like the smoky and the heat and
all of that I would love to know but no
I have not tried those eyeshadow
palettes yet either so I'm moving on to
another face palette that is the Kat Von
D shade + light contour palette I do
have a Kat Von D shade + light eye
palette which I have definitely
considered that to be a cult favorite
but the contour palette I have never
tried but I'm super excited because very
recently at my friend Candace sent it to
me and when I pulled it out I was like
no way I have always wanted to try this
I've always heard such good things about
it I'm pretty pumped about that and I
will be diving into that shortly and
seeing when I think about it but I can
remember when I started to watch the
YouTube channels and really like watch
them on a regular basis everyone was
like oh let me pull up my Kat Von D
shade + light contour palette Kat Von D
shade + light contour palette that was
like I need that palette but I never did
it for myself but I finally have it so
that is a cult favorite that I will be
trying really see a couple of like
different products of the NARS orgasm
blush I always hear so many things about
NARS orgasm and I remember that was a
blush that there was a time I went into
Sephora in the mall and I was in the
NARS section and I saw the blush and I
was like you need to buy that you need
to buy that because everybody's talking
about it and you haven't tried it so you
need to pick that blush up and buy it
and I ended up talking myself out of it
at the store but I had it in my hands
for so long I was like everybody loves
this blush everybody talks about it and
I ended up
putting it back I still have never tried
the NARS orgasm blush and it's funny too
because as I'm filming this the night
before I was doing the YouTube live I
was talking about Milani Luminoso blush
we were talking about new brands at Ulta
and I mentioned Luminoso and so many
people were like that's a dude for NARS
orgasm and I'm like how have I gotten
this long and I didn't even know that I
had no idea Luminoso it was considered a
dupe for NARS orgasm and I've had
Luminoso for such a such a long time
probably have them we know so when I was
walking around Sephora with orgasm in my
hand but that is another one that I have
never tried and then of the final item
that I believe is to be a cult favorite
that I have not tried yet is the Laura
Mercier a setting powder I mean
everybody and their brother and their
mother and their uncle and third dog
does the laura mercier setting powder
and I'm like nope haven't done it I did
buy the laura mercier secret brightening
powder I mean that's completely
different that's like a very
highlighting because I mean obviously
it's called the brightening powder it's
a very highlighting setting powder and I
like it because I like bright under eyes
especially like last year I would say I
was obsessed I would use like the
lightest concealers the laura mercier
secret brightening powder I was like
white under eyes maybe I didn't go that
far but I really want it really bright
under eyes so I bought that powder and I
very much enjoy it like the original the
regular Laura Mercier setting powder I
haven't tried it and honestly I don't
know if I will because I like the secret
brightening powder so much I don't know
if I'll try the regular one but yeah I
would consider that one a cult favorite
that I have not tried I guess oh that's
gonna be everything for the makeup
confessions tags cult favorite makeup
products and that I have not tried you
know this video was short and sweet but
before I saw Kelly do this tag I
actually have been working on buying a
couple of the cult favorite makeup
products because I want to do a video of
is are they worth it
type of video so I've actually slowly
been purchasing items here and there and
trying them out because I wanted to make
that video so as I was making my list I
was writing down some money but I was
like no I just bought that one for the
next video nope I bought that one for
the next video so stay tuned because I
will be having a cult favorite makeup
product test
do and if they're worth the hype if
they're not worth the hype I'm really
excited about that one I've been working
on that video for a long time but when I
saw Kelly do this video I was like
that's such a good idea and I want to do
it too so I probably would have had more
items had I not been working on this
other video but it was still a lot of
fun to go through and you know hear what
she hasn't bought and then a couple
other people have done the tag as well
and I've been watching their videos and
seeing what they haven't bought and some
of the items that are cult favorites
that I just have not bought yet but I
would love to know what are some of your
cult favorites that that you haven't
tried yet and do you plan on trying them
I would love to hear that in the
comments down below and of course make
sure to check out at Kelly's channel who
has started this tag she will be linked
in the description box along with her
video as well and as always if you guys
did enjoy this video I hope that you
