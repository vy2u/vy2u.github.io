today's video I'm really excited to do
because it's going to be all about
skincare I'd like to do skincare
collection videos about two times a year
so that's what today's video is going to
be I'm going to be focusing on all of my
favorite skincare products so the
skincare products that I use like most
consistently what's in my collection
right now when I'm using on a really
consistent basis so I love skincare I
love trying out skincare finding
skincare products that I love so that's
I'm so excited to do this video Before
we jump into it I do have dry skin I
also have a sensitive skin and I'm not
super acne prone here and there I will
get breakouts
I don't struggle with anything like
rosacea but I do have pretty textured
skin again every once in a while and
then I'm also 31 so I do not have the
most youthful skin of anybody around so
that's a little bit about my skin type I
also do want to let you know the first
portion of this video is going to be
sponsored by the brand male of you're
talking about their glow maker
antioxidant serum in the beginning of
this video so I didn't want to let you
know so thank you to my love for
reaching out for me for letting me try
this product and for letting me Chad
buttocks I think it's pretty darn cool
but if you are ready to see some of my
skincare favorites my most used skincare
products let me go ahead and get started
so like I said I'm gonna be kicking it
off it's talking about this may love the
glow maker antioxidant serum so Jackie
from may love reached out to me and
asked if I would want to try this serum
and work together with her in a video so
I said sure thing go ahead and send me
the serum I'll give it a try for a while
I'll check in I'll let you know what I'm
thinking about it so this is what the
bottle looks like and it does come in a
dropper form such as this but says you
get an extra boost of nourishment and
protection with this balanced formula
that includes vitamins A C and E and
then in there how to use it says in the
morning after cleansing you apply three
or five drops to a dry face neck and
chest
that's exactly how I've been using it
I've been testing it out for well over a
month now I don't know if you'd be able
to see through the labeling I'm about
right here like I said I've been using
this basically every single morning for
over a month and I feel like a little
bit does go a very
way so you would be able to have this
bottle for quite some time so the serum
is going to be $28 and you do get free
shipping I of course will have a link
down below and it also send me a 10% off
code if you are interested in trying
this out at a Sam fan Sam fan it'll be
on the screen and also in the
description box it's not an affiliate
link for me it would just be discount
code for you if you know what I think
was pretty interesting and kind of like
the first line that caught my attention
when I was emailed to try out this
product was as a skincare start up brand
and I started by MIT engineers I was
like tell me more I wanna know more and
they said kind of like their mission of
their brain is to provide a luxury
skincare at an affordable cost which
again I thought was pretty fantastic if
you have a little list of ingredients
here that I want to read like I said
there's vitamin C and E in there and
there's also hyaluronic acid which I
love in my skincare it's great for
hydrating the skin
there's also grape extract aloe and
Magnolia it says to keep your skin
hydrated which i think is fantastic and
this is made in the US as well also one
thing that I thought was pretty darn
interesting is that they offer a 100 day
money-back guarantee so if you get this
and you try it out up to a hundred days
and you don't love it you don't see the
results from it you can get your money
back for it and I don't know anyone I
don't think who offers a 100 day
money-back guarantees I feel like that's
pretty intense and that shows how much
they really stand behind their product
um you do get one a fluid ounce in here
for the $28 as well and just like what
it says it's the Glo maker it's supposed
to be really hydrating for the skin it's
supposed to be really brightening afford
the skin what I like to do in the
morning like I said a little bit goes a
long way and I kind of found if I drop
it onto my fingers I kind of make a mess
because it's very liquidy so I just go
ahead and drop it on to my skin I have
an Instagram video from a few weeks back
maybe even a month back using this serve
and you see I just drop it on that's not
to be like Instagram cool I think that's
the best way to apply things with a
dropper otherwise it like drips all over
my sink and stuff like that so I just do
like one on my forehead one on my cheek
one on the other cheek and then I blend
to add it to my face and then also on to
my neck and like I said I've been using
this very consistently I'm really liking
the way it makes my skin feel it's kind
of one of those things where you can see
I don't want to say like an instant
instant glow like the second
oh I'm so glowy it's not quite to that
effect but you can tell over I would say
within a week's period of time of me
using it that you're able to see the
results you're able to see that it's
brightening your skin so I've been
having a great time using this in the
morning and again like I said I think a
little bit goes a long way so for $28
for the one fluid ounce and a money-back
guarantee I think that's all pretty cool
I'm interested like I want to keep an
eye on this brand and see what they come
out with next and we're kind of like the
direction that they're going to go
because I think that they sound a pretty
darn interesting but that is the glow
maker the antioxidant serum from Mela
thank you to them for letting me talk
about this product for letting me try it
out and for also working with me on a
part of this video I do appreciate it so
again the link and then also my discount
code will be down below in case you're
interested or has anyone tried this yet
I would love to know so next up I am
very brand loyal when it comes to skin
care when it comes to makeup when it
comes to like clothing companies and
things like that so how I usually do my
skincare videos is I kind of break it
down by brand and that's um what I'm
gonna do in this one to instead of going
by like process of the skincare
collection I like to go by brands that's
just what I prefer so first up I'm gonna
talk about pixie beauty I really really
enjoy pixie skincare I've tried a lot of
products from them and a lot of items
are my favorites now this one is the
glow tonic I just mentioned this one and
the products that I wish I would have
tried sooner because I really really
enjoy this guy I have a smaller one of
it as well this is my big guy that was
sent to me from pixie lips uh samantha's
glow tonic which i think is really cool
it's an exfoliating toner and I've
recently been getting into toners after
watching other skincare videos and
seeing how people say that toners can be
really good for your skin after
cleansing and stuff it's nice to come in
with a toner just to make sure you do
have everything removed sometimes even
when I double cleanse I'll come in with
a toner and I'll see on my makeup pad
that I have not removed all of my makeup
so if you're going to bed with makeup
still on your skin that's a great way to
have your skin break out this gives me a
little tingles on the skin it's taking
everything off and I do think it's
helping to hydrate the skin make it a
little bit more glowy so the pixie glow
tonic I really enjoy this has been one
of
my favorite products from Pixy and it's
in my 18 and 2018 project pan actually
because I want to remember to use it on
a consistent basis because this is the
peel and polish now I can only use this
once a week so something that I don't
use like every day or every night I can
kind of sometimes forget about it it can
get kind of put to the bottom of my
drawer so that's one of the reasons that
I put it in my project pan because like
I said I do have sensitive skin it says
this is a resurfacing concentrate and it
does have like those exfoliating kind of
gritty beads in there so like I said I
can only use it about once a week
otherwise my skin will become too
irritated but it says it's a salon peal
treatment made easy at home there's
natural fruit enzymes to exfoliate and
polish
lifts away dead skin cells and I just
feel like when I use this I really do
feel like I've just done something at
the spa but I'm doing it at home and it
only takes a few minutes if you have
sensitive skin I recommend only once a
week I love using this weekly and then I
typically follow up this with the glow
tonic and then another item that I love
and I've gone through one of these
already this is the pixie in
collaboration with Carol and her bronze
this is the double cleanse so on one
side you have a solid cleansing oil to
remove your makeup and then on the other
side you have a cleansing balm so this
ID here is the cleansing oil will come
in and just remove all of my makeup and
then I'll come in on this side do the
double cleanse make sure I have
everything off and just make sure like
my skin is clean ready for bed and all
of that good stuff
like I said I've already gone through
one of these and I just really enjoyed
them I like kind of having the two in
one in here that's really nice and
convenient but this is another favorite
from pixie next up I want to talk about
Olay I have three items here from Olay
as well these daily facials are some of
my favorite products just hands-down
so this one I have two different boxes
actually but this one is the daily
hydrating clean grapeseed extract
five in one cleansing cloth so basically
it is just a dry cloth you get it wet
and activates it it will remove your
makeup it'll cleanse your skin and I
just think these are balm especially for
traveling so this is what the little
cloth looks like and you can just kind
of open it up here you run it under
water and then you can scrub your face
with it you can remove your eye makeup
with it it takes everything off I love
these for traveling because they're so
easy to travel with
not bringing a big bottle with me you
know especially if I'm flying on a plane
and you got pull lid with situation
going on these are so small they can fit
so easily into your bag into your purse
whatever it is you want to do for my
Arizona vacation I was gonna be gone for
five nights I grabbed out five of these
put them in my little skincare bag and
boom I have what I'm gonna have to
remove my makeup so they're super easy
to travel with I've gone through several
several boxes of these and they're just
one of my favorite products so I highly
recommend the daily facials and then
this is also a product that I've either
mentioned in a favorites video or I've
talked about it somewhere because I love
this guy oh I think it was in my makeup
backup drawer I think it was this is the
Olay eyes deep hydrating eye gel and
it's a good thing that I already have a
backup of it because this guy is pretty
much God I'm like trying my best to
scrape out every teeny tiny last bit of
this this is such a nice IGEL it's
really cooling it's really hydrating for
the under eyes it helps to deep Hough I
love using this in the morning
especially if I've gotten like a rough
night sleep and you can tell by my under
eyes this is one of my favorite idols
hands down I've already repurchased one
for myself and then the last product
that I want to recommend this is a new
one from Olay but I'm trying to really
like this one this is the luminous whip
moisturizer this is a moisturizer that I
like to use in the morning you can see
I've put a considerable dent in here
this is one that I like to use in the
morning because again it's super
hydrating but it's so lightweight this
is a moisturizer that I feel like the
first time I was using it I was like wow
this is a really different consistency
and I feel like I've tried in a
moisturizer because it's lightweight but
it's like you're putting water on your
skin if you have dry skin I think that
you would really really like this guy I
said let's talk about Dermalogica
another one of my favorite skincare
brands these are the three items that
I'm using very consistently right now
but there's a lot from Dermalogica
that I recommend and you've probably
seen over time in my videos this is the
pre cleanse
I love the pre cleanse this might have
been mentioned in my makeup backup
drawer if not I did recently purchase
this as well because I love the pre
cleanse and I
right here on it and this is one of my
favorite ways to remove my makeup you
have a little pump here I put it onto a
cotton pad and it takes everything off
liquid liner mascara liquid lipstick
flash flash at false eyelash adhesive it
takes everything off for me if I have
glitter on my eyes this is what I'm
using I love this it works so well I
think it's fabulous I have two cleansers
that I want to talk about one is just
like a staple cleanser in my collection
I can't even remember it's been forever
since I've been using this cleanser this
is the special cleansing gel this is a
travel sized version of it I do have a
full-size but honestly it's kind of like
in rough shape it's almost gone it's
it's about gone and it's just like kind
of dirty and it kind of like bothered me
so I have a travel version here as well
but this is what it looks like the the
bottle that you get is giant and this is
the cleanser that I use almost every
single morning and it is going to last
you for cover and I don't skimp on my
cleanser like I'm putting a decent size
in my hand and I've had that bottle for
ever I also have a little travel guy of
it because like I said I just enjoyed
this cleanser I like it too come with me
so instead of having to take my huge
bottle I have a little guy here as well
again if you have sensitive skin I think
this will be really nice for you because
it's really like a gentle cleanser I
like using it in the mornings because
I'm not really worrying about like
taking my makeup off I'm just kind of
cleaning my skin and getting it ready
and I think it works really well for
that this one is a new cleanser to me
but the moment that I started using it I
was like yeah we're gonna get along
great
this is the skin resurfacing cleanser I
wanted to get this one because it says
and it helps with texture and like I
said I do deal with texture so I thought
that was really important it says it's a
dual action exfoliating cleanser to help
retexturize skin it says it has highly
active lactic acid concentrate to help
retexturize skin suffering from visible
signs of aging by removing dulling
service debris and helping accelerate
cell turnover it has vitamin E and rose
a flower oil to calm the skin and again
this is just one I like using this at
night because I can feel it just has a
little bit more umph than the special
cleansing gel but I feel like I've been
using this for three to four weeks now
and I feel like I
been able to see a difference in my skin
I just I really like Dermalogica as a
brand I've bought a lot of their
products myself really enjoy them but if
you suffer with texture dull skin you
know maybe like aging skin this isn't
their age smart line I would suggest
looking at this one next up let's talk
about lenders in one of my new favorite
favorite brands so kind of what started
my obsession with them is this poor
balance of facial asana scrub I
purchased a many of this in a trio and
instantly fell in love with it I keep
this in my shower and it's really unique
when you put it on it's actually really
born almost hot I leave it on while I'm
like conditioning my hair shaving my leg
I love multitasking why not do it in the
shower that's what I do with a lot of my
masks and this one I just think is so
cool when you take it off it's actually
very cooling like as I put my face on
her to the stream and wipe it off it's
very cool I think that is really awesome
but I like to do in the shower too
because the you know the hot water and
the steam kind of helps open up the
pores and that's when I like to go in
and mask I feel like it's a really good
time to do that but this one I've just
really been loving and like I said I
have the mini I went out and purchased
the full-size myself and that's kind of
what startup me was like maybe I'll try
some more products from Lula Hendrickson
and so the next one that I want to talk
about is their truth serum I have a mini
guy here and now I also have a full-size
and I mean my mini is getting down there
it's about two here I took this on my
Arizona vacation with me as well this
one I I kind of go back and forth
sometimes I use it really consistently
in the morning sometimes I use it really
consistently in the evening right now
I'm in the morning I like using this in
the morning but I also will use it in
the evening I'll switch it up a little
bit it is it says it's collagen boosted
and I feel like you can kind of notice
like especially if I use it before I go
to sleep when I wake up it's almost like
your skin's just a little like plumper
but like not in a bad way in a good way
so this one I really do like a lot of
people give a lot of hype to the truth
serum and I would agree I really enjoy
it
I know the product that I want to
recommend from them that I really really
love this is the uncover the truth three
and one
melting cleanser I mentioned this in my
Sephora VAV stone recommendations video
because this is one of my favorite ways
to remove makeup as well so it's just
this cleansing balm it smells really
good it smells very very orange very
vitamin C and
it just does such a good job of taking
everything off but I also love the way
that it feels like it just feels like it
just feels nice on the skin I do need to
talk about drunk elephant I do have some
favorite products from them as well
drunk elephant as a very pricey skincare
brand AB if you guys would like to see a
full dedicated video to all of my drunk
elephant products and everything I've
been trying out what I don't think is
worth it what I think is okay and some
of my favorites do let me know because
I've been working my way I got a really
generous PR package from them and I've
been working my way through everything
so I could review it all but if you'd
want to see it in one video let me know
if you would find that helpful but a few
of my favorites I mean definitely hands
down this guy I feel like a lot of
people talk about it but it's the TLC is
to carry baby facial if you watch my
Instagram stories every single Monday
you see me using this it is this is
something that like makes me look
forward to Monday because this is it's
basically like an at-home facial for you
but it's very intense and it's very
powerful it recommends only using it one
to two times a week if you have
sensitive skin only use it once a week
because like I said it is powerful every
single time I use this one you can feel
it on your skin and it's just it tingles
a little bit like maybe the first two to
three times I put it on it's not painful
but it's definitely like whew
something's happening and then over time
I've kind of like gotten used to it I
think but you can still feel the tingles
there and you leave it on for 20 minutes
and then when you take it off I mean
this stuff this is just good stuff this
is good stuff I will repurchase this
myself and it does have 25% aah a in it
I think it's fabulous once I get done
using this I immediately come in and put
on their virgin marula luxury facial oil
again I basically only use this on
Mondays this is a very expensive product
as well and I use this right after this
because this is it's really nice to use
an oil after such an intense treatment
it just feels like nice and like you're
kind of like soothing your skin that
type of thing and it's a really like
thick Luxur luxurious
oil it definitely is but because it's so
pricy like I don't want to just use it
anytime like I want to use it if my skin
like is really calling for this thick
oil but this is really nice as well this
is one of the first products
that I got from drunk elephant that I
started trying it that I mentioned as a
favorite because it's really good to
others that I would highly recommend
from a drunk elephant one is the c4 my
day serum I feel like a lot of people
say really good things about this too
and I do get it the packaging on it is
awesome with this kind of like airtight
container here you use this in the
morning and the only it's like the only
only thing that I don't love about it is
that if I'm doing something where I'm
gonna get up and I'm immediately gonna
do my makeup I tend to skip this because
it kind of like stays on your skin for a
while like it doesn't immediately absorb
into the skin so to use this and then
immediately do your makeup but will not
work out because it'll just be funky but
if I'm gonna have you know usually it's
a couple hours before I sit down and
start filming sort of thing so that's
what I do like to use this but I feel
like once I started using this very
consistently I could see really good
results with my skin and same as the
next product that I was going to mention
this is the TLC glycolic night serum to
refine and retexturize again these are
two products that I started using and I
thought were pretty good but once I
started using them consistently it was
consistently like I stopped kind of
trying out other skin care products and
I was like no I want to give these a
good go I feel like I could notice a big
difference in my skin so the night serve
this is another one that almost kind of
gives me a little bit of tingles when I
do put it on it does have aaj and BHA it
says it'll resurface dull congested
congested skin by gently lifting white
dead skin cells and again a little bit
goes a long way with both of these guys
packaging is great on both of them but
they're expensive but I think that they
will last a very long time and I think
the actual ingredients inside will still
last a very long time because of the
packaging and these are just another two
of my favorite products from Jung
Culloden I'm a big fan of sheet masks if
you watch my empties videos there's
usually several sheet masks that are
getting mentioned in there so that
brings me to my next brand which is
ecology I started using with hydrology
with their sheet masks and these are two
of my favorites if I had to choose two
to recommend these are the two that are
it and probably the most often seen the
sheet mask in my empties video this one
is the smart mud mask to detox it's a
two-part mask every
did an Instagram video and I use this
mask I'll link it down below in case
you're interested so you have a bottom
strip and a top strip but it's a mud
mask in a sheet mask which I love
because I love mud masks for really
pulling any impurities out of the skin
or the detoxing the skin but they can be
super messy I can get messy my hair can
get messy this thing can get messy and
nobody I've got time to clean that so
having it in a sheet mask I think is
fantastic the other one that's my
favorite from ecology this is the milk
peel this is a 5-minute mask I usually
keep this one on for 10 this is a
five-minute mask so it's really nice and
quick for someone who's usually very
busy throughout the day such as myself
and it's good for sensitive skin it's a
peel in a sheet mask it has a lactic
acid in it but again it's good for
sensitive skin I'm not super red when I
get done using this I'm not super
irritated but I feel like I've noticed a
difference with my skin so these are two
of my favorite sheet masks and also this
one I think I mentioned this recently in
a favorites video this is the restoring
night cloud mask I really enjoy using
this as a sleeping cream as well I have
quite a bit gone from here this is
another one that when I put it on you
can kind of you kind of like just feel
it working on the skin this guy does
have retinol in it as well I use it
usually two to three times a week and
then typically when I'm not using this I
am using the drunk elephant but I really
like this guy as well and I would
recommend it from petrology misstep I
have an item here from number 7 I was
kind of surprised to see that this is
the only item that I'm using very
consistently right now in my skincare
routine from number 7 but I do recommend
a lot of their skincare they have a lot
of really nice serums as well I've gone
through a lot myself I've recommended
them quite a bit but the item that I'm
using it consistently right now is the
eye cream and this is the protect and
perfect intense advanced eye cream this
is one where you know some people go
back and forth and eye creams I've
already mentioned the one from Olay I'm
a big fan of them I always use them and
I always have for the longest time my
grandmother always recommended using eye
creams and I just always kind of took
that to heart this is a nice kind of
like thicker eye cream I like to use it
for nighttime it doesn't have any
benefits like the Olay like cooling or
hydrating it's a little bit of a thicker
eye cream but again I just really
enjoyed this one and I feel like with
eye creams you either kind of know that
it's for you or you know that it's not
for you and this is what
for me so I would recommend that one
from number 7 from glossier I have their
milky jelly cleanser which is a
conditioning a face wash I keep thinking
that my overheating light is coming on I
don't know what it is I'm seeing in my
camera but if you keep seeing me look up
I'm like oh no my camera's about to shut
off it's not stood weird things so this
guy I got from glossier and I really do
enjoy it actually I feel like I finally
started to put a pretty good dent in it
I like to use this especially with a
double cleanse like if I use a cleanser
that I just feel like hasn't gotten
everything off I like to come in with
this guy because I feel like it really
does a good job of taking everything off
I like the kind of jelly consistency of
it like it's not too thick but it feels
kind of like nice and like just really
cleansing on the skin I know a lot of
people say really good things about this
one and I'm happy to say that I really
enjoyed this as well and that I seem to
always have in my skincare collection is
from a Kate Somerville this is the
exfoliate exfoliate excuse me it's an
intensive exfoliating treatment it says
it's the Hollywoods
two-minute facial again this is very
intense a few of sensitive skin I
recommend only using this once a week
you only keep it on the skin for two
minutes but it is really taking
everything off it's getting your dead
skin cells off all of that good stuff I
used to think if I had dry skin that
exfoliators would not work for me but
actually it's kind of like the opposite
you want to make sure that you're coming
in and removing any of those dead skin
cells that are sitting on top of your
skin and exfoliate her's are a great way
to do it but you don't want to over
exfoliate at the same time again I would
only recommend using this once a week I
typically have minis in my collection if
I see like a skincare set at Sephora
that you know it's like a point perk or
you know one of those where you put in
the code and you can get a couple
products if I see this one I almost
always pick it up because I really do
enjoy it and I feel like it's really
doing good things for my skin next up I
have some items here from fresh this is
the same thing and I've talked about
this in several videos but the soy face
cleanser again I always have a many of
this always haven't been any of this in
my collection this is just a really nice
cleanser I prefer to use it in the
morning kind of reminds me a little bit
of the glossy a jelly cleanser that I
was just talking about like the
consistency kind of reminds me of it
it's just a nice lightweight cleanser
again I think it would be nice for
sensitive skin and it
and I also can help remove some residual
makeup as well I just got this item from
fresh so take this one with a grain of
salt but this is the Rose deep hydration
at facial toner I was so excited that
fresh sent this to me cuz I was gonna
purchase it in the vib sale
I've only been trying it out for
probably like 10 days or so but this is
a product that I'm excited to try and
like one of those that I'm like Samantha
you don't need to use a toner today or
like you've already used your pixie
toner but and I'm like but I I want to
use this toner so I've only you know
I've only put a very small dent into it
but I like the way that it smells I love
the way that it looks it's so beautiful
but I feel like it's really nice you
know it's making sure that I do get all
of my makeup off and then it's just kind
of like a soothing hydrating toner for
the skin I would say my my face seems to
be liking it so that's good I'll have a
full review coming up shortly but I
wanted to give this guy mention I know I
mentioned it that I was going to buy it
in my wishlist video so I didn't want to
say that fresh did send this to me they
didn't ask me to review it or anything
but I'm really liking this guy one of my
favorite eye makeup removers is from
Lancome this is the bi-facil eye makeup
remover again mentioned this in my swear
vib recommendations I also did purchase
this during the vib sale I purchased a
mini of this guy and also the bi-facil
face makeup remover so I'm excited to
try out the face remover but you can see
I'm almost out of this one so I wanted a
backup of the eye makeup remover a
little bit goes a very long way and
takes everything off again glitter lash
adhesive stubborn mascara waterproof
mascara it doesn't matter this takes
everything off and it's it's literally
one of those like if you watch like
makeup remover commercials and someone
puts a little bit of remover and just
goes through and you're like that
doesn't happen in real life
no it does it does with this we are
almost done I want to talk about first
aid Beauty the facial radians pads from
first sight Beauty I consistently have
these in my collection and I have for
several years now they're just as some
of my favorites again they're really
nice and easy to travel with it's just a
little cotton pad here that is soaked
with the product it will help exfoliate
to tone to brighten again I get a little
tingle with these when I use them but I
continually buy these guys I always want
in my collection I like to take them
traveling with me so I really enjoyed
those another one I want to give like an
honorable mention too because I've only
trying it out for a few times now but I
thought I would mention it here this is
the coconut my seller makeup melter I
believe this is a new product from first
aid beauty I did get this as sent to me
from octoly which had me pretty excited
it's supposed to dissolve all of your
makeup even long-wear makeup it's safe
for sensitive skin first aid beauty I
started purchasing from them because
they were good with sensitive skin or
like for people with sensitive skin and
so when I saw this pop-up of my octoly
store I was like I really want it so far
I like it it does have a pump on it it's
very I don't know if you could tell from
the product in here but it's very like
almost almost more of like a cleanser
slash lotion type of thing I don't know
it's very interesting but it takes a
very little product to get it all over
your face I you know remove my eye
makeup with this and I don't have any
problems with irritation or anything the
only thing that I'll say is I don't
really I don't quite feel like it's
getting everything off I do feel like I
need to double cleanse or do you use a
toner when I use this product it's
getting like the first layer off um it's
really good with eye makeup remover I
will say that but like for my face I
still feel like I'm removing a lot of
foundation in my double cleanse or with
my toner with this guy budge on this one
briefly because I've mentioned it in a
pretty recent video this is from
colorscience it's the total I three and
one renewal therapy I put it in a
skincare video because it's really been
helping underneath my eyes it's also
it's a treatment product as well so even
though you get instant results when you
use this it's also supposed to be
helping over time I'll insert a before
and after photo of me with this product
but basically it's just a little pump
like this you pump out some of the
products here and it's kind of a got
like a peachy tint to it so it helps to
color correct around my eyes but it just
instantly makes your eyes look more
awake a lot of times in the morning when
I wake up this is just what I used right
away I took this to Arizona with me on
the early mornings when I didn't want to
like full-on get ready I still put this
on because it does color correct my eyes
it makes me look more awake
it just looks me makes me look a little
bit more human so I really appreciated
this product for that and like I said
it's a treatment product so it's helping
over time so I've really enjoyed this
guy the last item that I want to put in
here just because you know this is what
I use I've been talking about oh I put
this on a cotton pad
on a cotton pad it's the Shiseido cotton
facials oh yeah I love these guys I
still have so much left in my bag that I
purchased not in this past vib sale but
the previous vib sale like the fall
winter time is when I purchased these I
think these are a great deal I love them
they are now only what I use when I am
putting a cleanser a toner anything onto
a cotton round it is only these you
don't get any cotton fiber stuck to your
face to your lashes they don't fall
apart they don't disintegrate and I also
use these to remove my nail polish
because same thing I'm not getting
cotton fibers stuck in my fingernails
when I'm removing my nail polish so I
think these are awesome you can find
them at Sephora highly recommend hi guys
