channel so today's video is going to be
a first impression demo and like all day
first impression I have no idea what I'm
going to call this thing but it is all
about the clinique beyond perfecting 2
11 foundation and concealer is right
here so so I feel like recently everyone
is raving about this foundation so I
purchased fun during the Sephora vib
sale so I could see what all the hype
was about it is a $27 foundation which
is why I watched by during the VIP sale
because of course that is a little bit
more expensive than the typical
drugstore foundations that I use but I
wanted to give it a try and see what I
think I'm going to be applying it to my
face I'm going to be doing different
check-ins throughout the day and let you
guys know how it's holding up and then
at the end letting you know how the
entire day went if i think i would
recommend it who i would recommend it
for hang out together today and see how
the clinique beyond perfecting
foundation and concealer so i will be
doing a first impression and i'll be
doing like check-ins throughout the day
living you know how it since the
foundation is holding up well you guys
see how it's holding up all that good
stuff it's the first video that i'm
doing like this i'm a little like what
am i doing but i will try it out so
obviously the foundation we're using is
the cleaning be on purpose beyond
perfecting the foundation plus a
concealer this is what the packaging
looks like and this is the second one
that I've had to get so this video is
coming a little bit later I ordered one
during the Sephora vib sale but it was
like six shades too light for me and I'm
not even kidding I don't know if I just
didn't pay attention to the shades like
I was just so excited about the vib sale
that I just like put something in my
cart and then checked out and didn't
even bother to look at the shade I have
no idea because literally the shade that
I got was in one linen and then my
correct shade when I went to sephora the
other day this is in 6.5 buttermilk like
I was way off but when you open it up
this is what it looks like it's a really
nice glass bottle might not be the bus
we're traveling because glass is kind of
scary but it does look really nice feels
heavy
II and when you open it up has a little
bit of a different applicator so this is
what the applicator looks like from what
i have seen I've watched maybe to review
videos of this and people are saying a
little bit goes a long way so I will
keep that in mind when applying i have
only applied this to my face once and i
did like a instagram demo of if you buy
a to light a foundation how you can
darken it up that's the only time that
I've used it and I only left it on my
face for maybe a couple hours before I
washed it off so I don't feel like I've
actually been able to like see what's
going on with this but that's what we're
going to do today so from the box some
you see it says if allergy tested one
hundred percent fragrance-free says
moderate to full coverage and natural
matte finish it says this is a
foundation and concealer and one for
unnatural beyond perfect it look that
lasts all day lightweight moisturizing
makeup covers thoroughly without
clogging pores color stays true even
through spot and humidity for complete
coverage dot all over the face and blend
use the unique applicator to spot
conceal and oil-free okay so right now
it is 955 you can see that on my phone
so 955 button o'clock i'm going to go
ahead and put this on i think i'm going
to do one side on my face with a brush
and then one side of the face with a
Beauty Blender and see what I think dot
it on so I don't know do a little bit of
this section feels kind of kind of
strange but we'll go ahead and do this
I feel like that's a lot I don't know
we'll see and then I'm going to use the
Beauty Blender for this side and I have
primed my face I of course forgot to let
you guys know that but I prime my face
with the tart clean smoothing primer
hold on sir with the tart clean slate
timeless smoothing primer I just
mentioned this in my favorites video so
that is the primary that I'm using okay
so if I'm saying this is a much better
color match than one linen that didn't
do anything i'm also using my new nude
beauty blender that i picked up during
the sale as well i think it's super cute
this is my first beauty blender I have
the Real Techniques sponge but I've
never owned a Beauty Blender and I just
thought the nude one was so cute so
actually like I don't feel like that was
too much it blends out super easily to
me it's a little bit sheer I would say
it's more of a lighter coverage but that
very well p could be because using a
damp Beauty Blender but i'm going to go
ahead and do the other side and then
buff that in with a foundation brush and
see what I think okay so i'm just going
to do maybe i'll do something different
on this site i'm gonna use swipes
because that's actually how i've seen
people do it is kind of doing more than
the swiping motion like this I have no
idea of this will make any sour
difference but that's what we're going
to do we use the morphe em a 439 this is
one of my favorite foundation brushes
i'm going to use that to buff in the
foundation okay so i can already like
tell a huge huge difference from the
Beauty Blender to a brush the brush
you're definitely getting a
lot more full coverage I've hair like
flying everywhere you're definitely
getting more of a full coverage when I
use the Beauty Blender it was much more
on the lighter scale and even just like
looks darker on that side of my face so
I think that will be something good
because there's days where I want a more
full coverage foundation you know
there's just like Thursday's that that's
what you prefer and there's days where I
want a little bit of a sheer foundation
and you can go both ways with this
depending on what you want to use to
apply it so today for what like I'm
thinking for what I want to do I would
rather have fuller coverage so I'm going
to put just a little bit more foundation
on the side of my face that I use the
Beauty Blender just like a little bit of
swipes here and I'm going to blend that
in with the brush and also see how
buildable it is it seemed to build up
just fine didn't turn chunky or cakey or
anything like that when I put another
layer on that set in my face so that's
good I think it does look really nice on
the skin it covers everything pretty
well so far if you guys can tell like it
covered everything pretty well it looks
good on the skin it doesn't look cakey
or anything like that it's definitely
more of a matte finish there's not i
need like much luminosity to it if you
do like more luminous foundations you
can always use like a luminous primer
underneath I didn't use when I just used
more of a regular one but there's not
really any luminosity to the skin it's
definitely more on the matte finish side
but it's not like matte finish you know
because I actually I don't like that
kind of look I'm going to set the
foundation as well and I thought about
like I was like should I do this or
should I not set the foundation but I
said the
foundation no matter what so I don't
feel like I would properly be able to
review it on myself or compared to my
other foundations because when i use
other foundations i'm always selling it
so i'm going to set the foundation i'm
going to use the Maybelline master fix
thy face to do its they're setting and
perfecting loose powder it's freaking
bomb and I'm going to use the morphe III
I just mentioned this in my favourites
video i believe it was so i'm just going
to use this loose powder and set that
all over my face i do like the color
matching and i would say when I went
into sephora to exchange it and i was
looking through the colors i'm not a
very tan person but i'm not super duper
pale either but i would say like their
shades were pretty pretty light a lot of
them were on more of the pinkish side
which actually i use more pink toned
concealers versus yellow concealer so
that actually work out for me but i
would say like male ego a shade darker
like pick out what you think your shade
is and then maybe cloche a darker
because i feel like that's what I kind
of had to do and that worked out well
for me so that would be my suggestion on
the color matching okay so that is done
a foundation in place it is now 1008 and
I will check in in a call on back so
this is my first check in it is now a
127 so I've had it on for what three
three and a half hours three a half
hours so let me get a mirror I don't
even know what i look like i have not
managed to put on any other makeup and
not three and a half hour time span but
i feel like this is holding up pretty
well
can you guys hear that noise
what is this what what what is this
vehicle I have no idea what is going on
outside my window some huge truck it's
going by
okay so I do feel like it is holding up
extremely well I don't see any cake eNOS
I do have a little bit of redness like
right around my nose and I think it's
from I was being outside and I was kind
of like itching at my nose a little bit
so I might touch up a little bit there
but other than that I don't really see
any issues I don't have oily skin I have
a pretty normal skin so I don't feel
like I need to blot or put powder
anywhere I don't see any real dry
patches so I'm just going to put a
little bit more around my nose I might
that red spot kind of popped up back
through that's underneath my eye so I
might put a little bit there to spot
conceal that redness but so far after
three and a half hours we are looking so
it is now 341 so it's been what like two
hours since my last check in yes i know
i only have one I dad I'm actually in
the process of filming this glitter look
but I thought before I like jumped fully
into the tour tutorial I would just pop
on here but also because I just took my
dog for a walk and it's pretty sunny out
and I mean I won't say that like I was
like full-on sweating but it was warm
out though I wanted to do a check in and
see how everything looks I also did
apply some bronzer and some blush
obviously I have one I den I think my
nose is still looking good i did a
little touch-ups around my nose that's
looking good this little red guy is
still I don't know what that is or where
it came from but that poked back out I
do have a like slight break out right
here you're not glitter in my hair don't
mind me and that's kind of peeking
through too but other than that again
like no nope achiness no dry spots like
i mentioned i'm not an oily person
nothing looks oily on me nothing looks
too dry or like gunked up the coverage
is still there for the most part besides
those two little areas so yeah I think
we're still looking good
ok so far what are we in totally I'm
like five and a half hours since I
applied it and I think it's still
looking good I've gone about my day I've
taken my dog for a walk so yeah I'm
going to finish doing this tutorial and
then I will try to check back in the
latest that i can tonight before i
absolutely lose every single bit of
lighting that i can so try to give and
try to give it like a full day but yeah
i will check back in welcome back ok so
it is now 6 48 in the PM i've tried to
wait as long as I could to do my final
check-in but I'm going to work out if I
need to wash my makeup off we've almost
lost all the sudden as well so i only
have natural lighting two films so I
could wait until like 11 o'clock to do a
final check in but ok final check-in so
I'm looking pretty crazy I look what up
stick on for several hours after i did a
makeup tutorial and then I ate a
sandwich I ripped my lashes off because
I did not like my lashes today but i
have like full makeup on my eyes are
done i have highlighted on my highlight
still looks really good hello Stiles a
Beverly Hills dripping in gold ok but
foundation wise it's still looking
really good like around my mouth like
sometimes around my mouth I can kind of
settle into fine lines are kind of cake
up and I seriously don't see any of that
around my nose looks time I did touch up
i think it was in the first check-in i
catched up a little bit of redness
around my nose haven't touched up since
then that still looks fine my second
check in i touched up this breakout up
here that actually still looks pretty
camouflaged this little red mark is
still kind of there but it's kind of
like blending into my blush and
highlight so not a big deal though even
though I do have makeup on like I think
my chin is just getting a little bit
shiny which I don't really struggle with
oily skin like I've kept saying but
everyone smile I can notice like just my
chin and I think it's because I rest my
fingers are so much which I know I
shouldn't do it's bad for you should
touch your face so I would say if
anything like if I was going to keep
going
like going to go out tonight or
something I would touch up just a little
bit on my chin and put some powder on
there as well but other than that
everything else looks really good on my
face I am very impressed with this
foundation i'm very happy i got it i
think this is actually my first like
higher-end foundation that i have so
that's pretty cool yeah so kind of my
final thoughts on the clinique beyond
perfecting a foundation + concealer was
very impressed with it if you remember
from when I put it on I used a Beauty
Blender on one side a foundation brush
on the other if you want to make this a
more sheer coverage i would suggest
using a damp Beauty Blender if you want
more of a fuller coverage use your
foundation brush again my shade is in
6.5 buttermilk if you guys want a little
bit of a reference what I noticed in
stores is that they're light shades are
light light light that they tend it to
range more into the like pink undertones
versus the yellow undertones which like
I mentioned it's good for me because I
pull cooler than I do warmer so I
actually didn't mind that again it is
twenty seven dollars i got mine on the
sephora website oh i just i'm super
impressed with the foundation it stayed
on all day a few minor touch-ups here
and there but overall stayed well on my
face and I like the coverage that it
gets its not a luminous coverage
definitely is more of a matte coverage
so that is what you like I would suggest
this again I think it would be fine for
people with oily skin it does say that
it's oil free and I didn't notice any
like big problems with oiliness at all
even though I'm not oily I'm more of a
combo skin so again I didn't notice
anything either like there was no dry
patches there's a few foundations that
can kind of like cling to dry spots and
I didn't see that happening with this on
it didn't settle into fine lines which
really really impressed me because that
can happen to and that sucks because
that looks weird so I don't know first
impressions and for leaving it on all
day I am super impressed with it I would
definitely say that I would recommend it
I'm very happy with my purchase I'm glad
that I
finally got the right shade I would
suggest if you don't know your shades
very well like me maybe go into sephora
test a few on your hand maybe put some
on your face see if you can figure out
your shade before you buy it or all too
hot to go back and return it like I did
yeah so that is going to be everything
for this video I hope you guys enjoyed
