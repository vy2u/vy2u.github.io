I'm going to be doing my first fashion
haul so I was really looking forward to
doing this and I've been shopping to a
few places so i thought i would show you
what I got I like to watch other fashion
halls and clothing hauls I like to see
where people are buying things from you
know there's new websites and stores
popping up all the time so I like to
learn about new things and it's also
nice to see when like new lines are
coming into certain stores so I got a
few things for like working out if you
know that I'm big into like yoga and
fitness got a few things for that got a
few new things from the Victoria's
Secret sportline to share and then also
from a boutique that I'm excited to
share with you guys so if you'd like to
see what I got please keep watching k so
first i went to kohls and for some
reason i do not seem to shop at clothes
a lot we have several here in towns have
real close to where I live I have a
kohls credit card but for some reason I
don't know I just don't think to shock
there a lot and I think we got like a
gift card so my husband and I went one
night and I was like wait a second I
like all these things and on one of our
recent trips I learned that they now
have like a rewards program so they did
have a credit card you did get really
good benefits of credit cards I never
want to push credit cards on anybody
because i know that's credit cards
aren't for everybody and all that sort
of thing but they have a lot of good
benefits like we went there recently and
I don't even know we had like thirty
percent off and we used the kohls card
we had like fifty dollars off a home
purchase and we had another ten percent
off like it was while we were just using
coupons everywhere it was kind of
awesome but so they have really good
rewards to that but now they actually
have just a plain old reward system so
you don't have to do a credit card or
anything like that I think it's just
called Cole's rewards or like yes
rewards or something like that so it's
just every time you shop you Hannah me
reward card are you plugging your phone
number and then when you get so many
points then you get like a coupon or
cash back or cash off things like that
so I just signed up one of like the last
times I was there so I think it's a
pretty new program but if you shop at
clothes a lot or you're really into like
the reward
grams I would check that out but I got
two things from there and the first one
is this chart and you can see the bottom
is really fringy I think I might have
worn this in one of my past videos and I
was like this is a straight up yoga
shirks if you can see the top so very
yoga ask what you drew me to it I have
an Instagram account with my friend we
are the cheeky chicks on Instagram and
we post yoga photos every day and it
seems like it's super popular to wear
the most outrageous you have the clothes
you can get some of our leggings and
tops and sports bras and things like
that can get pretty wild but people seem
to love it so we keep buying it so I
just love this I thought the top the
tie-dye the fringe like I just loved it
all it's super super comfortable it does
kind of come in on the side a lot like
you show a lot of sports bra on the side
but I don't mind that I guess and my dog
tends to like to eat the strings when I
wear it she's like thanks for playing a
game all day long so that's kind of fun
but this was from kohls the brand is
something karma wrecked karma maybe I
can't quite read that this is an extra
small and it's fairly big like this part
covers my entire stomach and then the
fringe goes like over like the waistband
of my yoga pants and things like that so
it's not particularly small it's not a
crop top by any means I don't show a lot
of stomach at any point but i just
thought it was fun and cute so that's
the first thing that I got from Kohl's
and another one I got this is from about
a girl brand and it's just another tank
top and it has this like fun out on it
which again it just drew me to excite
felt like it was very like yogi but the
bottom is really interesting because of
like the hemline can you guys see like
how wild this is it's like short in the
middle and then on the sides it goes
really really long and when we went camp
being a few months ago she had one of
these and she actually used it as like a
swimsuit coverup and it was an awesome
swimsuit coverup and that's pretty much
the ring main reason i bought it i
borrowed hers when we were camping and
then i was like i feel like i need one
of these two so I mean it could be a
good like tank top t-shirt as well I
honestly bought it as a swimsuit coverup
and that's what I will probably use it
for the most but again I just thought it
was super cute kind of fun yoga e so if
you guys can see that and this is a
small but really worn it yet i just got
it not too long ago so i tried it on in
the dressing room and you know it's big
it's along the sides come down like
probably halfway to my legs but i don't
know i just thought it was fun and
something kind of different i don't
really see those like different kind of
hems on shirts these days so i thought i
want to point out one thing if you guys
have noticed i did um go to the mall
today so I've swatches on my hands I
went to Sephora and swatched some of the
kat von d in the Stila liquid lipstick
so if you're seeing the swatches on my
hand that's why these are not come off
very easily like i need to dedicate a
few minutes to like scrubbing and
putting soap on my hands to get these
liquid likes to liquid lipstick swatches
off so i haven't done it yet i just got
home and started filming this video so
yeah if you notice this watch is here
they are whoa i have kat von d liquid
lipstick Berlin on my lips I tried this
out at the Sephora in our mall a few
others on my hand that i really like i
just wish i could find freaking lolita
no one has lolita not the savour is here
and not the sephora online no one has
low lead anyways that's my hall so the
next place that I went shopping is
called topple off clothing and I've
mentioned this in a few of my videos
because it actually is my sister-in-law
that Owens the boutique I think it was
last year maybe has it been last year
that she got an idea that she wanted to
start an online boutique and she did
just that it started off online and it
grew so popular that she decided to open
an actual physical store and the town
that she lives in which is care
Iowa it's about an hour and a half west
of Des Moines Iowa which is where I live
so she opened up a store there and it is
super successful I love going there I
love seeing what she has there and what
I can purchase super trendy and always
like she knows what's going to be in
style next so it's always so fun to go
there and see what she has and see what
i can find from there I recently
mentioned that i picked up the tan
towels and i was like super Danna one of
my videos because i had just cant held
myself but like she sells the tan towels
at the store and she has shoes and like
bandeau bras and more casual clothes and
I know like I don't know if she always
has clothes for kids but like clothes
for kids have been there too I love
going to her store I'm so proud of her I
think it's so amazing what she
accomplished in a short amount of time
with papal off clothing I just think
it's so incredible so I always want to
give her as many shots as I can't
because obviously I love her she is my
sister oh I got two things most recently
to share with you guys and the first one
is this top and it seemed like a pretty
basic top to me I picked it out because
I liked the color it's kind of like a
periwinkle blue kind of cool grey color
the brand is wasabi and mints well well
that's an interesting name so that's why
I like picked it up it seemed like a
good you know cab like not super casual
i'm wearing a t-shirt but not like super
fancy shirt kind of like the in-between
and now as i was walking around the
store as a sales girl was like oh I love
that shirt because I love the open back
and I was like what do you mean the open
back yeah for sure it has an open book I
was like okay now I really love this
shirt because as I mentioned like
sometimes I were a lot of crazy sports
bras or even with the bras from
victoria's secret these days are kind of
fun they have fun backs and all this
stuff so the open back it doesn't you
know you don't have to wear the bras
that look like you're wearing a regular
bra and it's like oh I can see the back
of your bra and that looks upward type
of thing you can have these fun sports
bras or these fund regular bras with the
fun
faqs so you can have open back now and
it's not as weird so I when I saw that I
was like yes now I have to get this
shirt so there's the really cute open
back and then just a really plain front
I've worn this a few times now I've
gotten compliments on it especially when
I turn around people are like wow that's
so cool so I really really dig this
shirt at the next one that I got our
Chisholm absolutely in love with this
shirt the brand is Miss Avenue and I got
a size small and it is just this like
beige color tank top but what I love is
that so it has the zipper detail in the
front but then it also has the same
zipper detail in the back and I remember
when I wore it the first time my husband
came up behind me and like unzip the bag
zipper all the way like what are you
doing is like on why do you have a
zipper there Mike cuz that's cool like
leave me alone this is this is what
we're going with right now he allows the
first happening I love it I think it's
super cute I think it's super trendy
it's very like lightweight and
breathable so we're in August now in
Iowa which basically means humidity it's
humid it's humid outside I really want
to put my hair up because it's even hot
inside my house today like for somehow
like the Sun is not really out it's kind
of overcast right now but it's hot and
it's humid I just went walking with my
dog and I had like long kind of like
longer capri pants long so I was like oh
it doesn't look like it's too bad
outside and we started walking and I was
like I can't breathe I can't breathe not
the heat the humidity so sure it's like
these i just think are awesome it
doesn't have to be super dressy but if
you're going to you know someplace nicer
and you don't want just like a casual
shirt this is a really good option for
it so i love it it's kind of long and
flowy at the end like it's it's not
short like if you raise your arms it's
not going to go up in like show any
stomach it's longer so it would even
look really good paired with like long
black shorts are like longer nicer dress
shorts type of thing and typically I
just wear like a black cami under it is
what I've been doing and yeah I love it
the few things that I've gotten from
tapleft clothing and
I said her store is in Carroll Iowa if
anyone's watching and you're in the Des
Moines area the store is in Carroll and
then they also have a website and you
can order off the website is file so i
will make sure to post the links in the
downbar below what I will try to do with
everything that I'm sharing is fine the
direct product links to that I know
sometimes that can be harder especially
with a store like top-left being a
boutique and they're always changing
their inventory but sometimes it's even
hard at like Victoria's Secret I can't
find something online like I've found it
one week and then I go the next week and
I can't find it so I will try to link
the exact products that I can for you
but regardless links for Topalov will be
below and then like I mentioned the last
door I have to talk about is a
Victoria's Secret so first I picked up
the sports bra and I feel like somebody
you guys are going to be like that's a
sports bra so this is the sports bra
that I got in its from their pink line
it says the pink on the straps I was
walking by and I was like oh that looks
super cute they were sold out so I had
to pick up an extra small which um I
didn't know if that was going to work
but all they had was extra smalls and
largest so all the smiles and all the
mediums and all four colors of this were
sold out there was pink blue I think red
and also like a neon yellow all the
smalls and mediums were sold out so I
was like clearly this was a really
popular sports bra and I gonna be able
to fit into an extra small and is this
going to do anything or is it going to
be more like I'm just going to take fun
yoga pictures in this sports bra I was
really surprised I think maybe because
it's an extra small versus a small which
i think would have been better for me it
actually is tight so it keeps them like
locked in and down when I run or even
like walk I'm like a power walker with
my dog when we go on walks I'm not
uncomfortable I don't feel like I'm
going to fall out of it at any point I
don't feel like it's too loose and I
honestly think it's because I have the
extra small so this might be better to
go a size smaller in but I'm just
shocked that it works so well because
there's like nothing to the
fabric I mean it is just there's no like
padding or lining or just what you think
would like need to hold you in for a
sports bra there's none of that in this
bra so I am just I'm shocked that I love
it so much but it also looks super cute
if you guys follow the cheeky chicks on
instagram i'm sure i don't have any yet
in the sports bar but i'm sure i'll be
posting some because it also looks
really cute i really like this like
polka dot feature on here and then just
the back is really fun so I'm really
excited for the sports bra it was from
the pink line i think it was like $32
and again they had about four different
colors and it seems to be a really
popular sports bra so apparently i must
not be crazy for liking it because it
seems like a lot of other people do too
another shirt that i got from the pink
line I thought this was super cute
because from the front it's just great
it has these like bluish green stripes
up here and then also the matching
pocket but the back is that same color
so I just thought that was super cute I
wore this in a video recently think
maybe it was like my July book favorites
that I did it in the sleeves so it's
like sleeveless but then there's pretty
large arm holes so you know you'll
probably show a lot of your sports bra
if you wear it but again that's kind of
like popular right now to do so it's
super cute is so comfortable both shirts
like athletic shirts that I got from
victoria secret are very very
comfortable so again this was from the
pink lines are small and it's pretty big
like it goes pretty long on me so I'm
happy with it if you like more beg your
workout shorts I think probably going
staying true to size or even going up
one size could work well for you
Victoria's Secret I feel like in their
clothing does tend to run big I usually
a small in most clothes but was victoria
secret i find myself going to the extra
small a lot and it works out well for me
but if you're into more like begire
workout clothes i would say either
staying true to size or going up a size
might work for you as well but this is
one shirt that i got this other one that
i got
from their vsx sportline so pink is
typically like a more affordable
victoria secret line and geared more
toward like the collegiate audience type
of thing our Victoria Secret has a lot
of like our schools like our big school
around here is the University of Iowa
they always have a bunch of University
of Iowa clothes and like Hawkeye themed
clothing and things like that they're
pink line is a lot of like baggy
sweatpants and like boyfriend sweatpants
and things like that and then they're
vsx sportsline is more for like older
women and I don't want to save like more
serious athletes by any means because i
buy from both lines pink is pink tends
to be more inexpensive and the victoria
secret sportline tends to be more
expensive but I don't know there's you
can kind of tell like an age difference
in there if you were to compare the two
but this one is from the vsx sportsline
and I just thought it was super cute
it's this like gray and orange combo I'm
really into orange right now I've
recently bought some new shoes from nike
and they're grey and orange so really
into the orange but the front it says
work and I thought that's all it said
and I was like yeah I like that and I
didn't realize till I was trying it on
on the back it says for it I'm like oh
okay whatever that works and then has
the vsx on there but this one also has
the really large arm holes and this is
even bigger than the other one that I
showed a lot of sports bra shows with
this shirt so just to beware if you
don't particularly like that a lot of
sports bra will show with this but I
thought I was super cute it was so
comfortable i went i did like an
eight-hour road trip by myself the other
weekend I went home to see a family
member and it was three and a half hours
each way and I did it by myself and I
went there I was home for like three
hours and then was immediately back on
the road it was a long day this is the
shirt I wore and I thought it was so
comfortable and I absolutely loved it so
I think this was a little bit more
pricey was like $45 I think but yeah
from the vsx sportsline and I will try
my hardest to find it so I can link it
for you below
the last thing that I got is also back
to the pink line I don't know if
honestly if they consider this I'll
workout shirt or a fun shirt I don't
really know but it's this fun like blue
green color can you tell that i like
blues and greens and oranges grace but
this one also has a super fun back so
this is what the back looks like and so
the straps are kind of like twisted by
themselves and then it has a big open
back so this is perfect for the fun
sports bras or even a regular bra that
has a fun back Victoria's Secret has a
bunch that have like a real lacy back I
have to I have one in orange and one in
blue that I honestly could probably wear
with this shirt that the back is like a
triangle of lace and so that's really
pretty so this could be an option that I
would wear with this shirt this is a
small and it just looks like it's going
to be very comfortable very breathable I
have not worn this one yet but it looks
to be like its pretty long the front
does appear to be shorter and then the
back is a little bit longer which can be
nice especially if you have like
low-rise pants orgies or even I have
some yoga pants that are so low rise and
I'm like I need to wear a long shirt
with this so it can be kind of nice when
the back is a little bit longer yeah so
this is also from the victoria secret
pink line that is everything for my
