channel thank you so much for watching
today I'm very excited for this video
because I'm glad she's doing a
collective makeup all and when I say
collective it means I'm going to be
hauling some products from Sephora color
pop and then also the drugstore so
instead of like I didn't get a whole lot
from each place so the haul videos would
probably be pretty short so I decided to
just clump it all together in one and
now I'm like well this could take a
while but we're just going to do a
collective makeup all I hope you enjoyed
what I have picked up I do have a few
reviews also on some of the products is
because i have tried some of them out
some of them i just got yesterday but
yeah let's see what i thought i got from
sephora and i will say i probably
wouldn't have done this much like makeup
shopping if i wasn't shopping for a
purpose and that is because i'm going to
be doing a big makeup giveaway once i
hit 1000 subscribers here on youtube we
are getting so close and I just have one
item left to buy for you guys and it
comes in store this weekend and I'm
going to go out and buy it on that day
i'm pretty sure each time i would go to
place an order for the giveaway I was
like would be I should pick up a little
something for myself too so that's why
I've been buying so much makeup lately
but once the giveaway is over are
probably going to like have to put
myself on a no x because I'm getting a
lot of stuff I need to get more like
makeup organization tools because I got
a lot going on but first from sephora i
picked a hub three lipsticks and a
primer but so the lipsticks that I got I
got two from the kat von d line and i
have never tried out any of her liquid
lipsticks before and i've been wanting
to for so long actually picked you guys
up one for the giveaway but then I was
like you know what I bind them one I'll
by myself too yeah why not to be honest
I did review these on my Instagram
and I don't love them and I'm really
really sad about that I'm not going to
lie you guys I'm pretty bummed out that
these don't seem to work for me because
so many people love them and have good
things to say about them and then I put
them on and I was like no that didn't
that doesn't work at all for me but the
colors that I picked up our Requiem
which is this like light purple and then
also noble which is like a nude peach
shade and I like the colors just fine
both of them were a lot lighter than I
expected them to be like I put one layer
on and you could still see my lips and
so I'd have to layer them up which is
pretty hard to do with liquid lipstick
it's not the easiest thing but those are
the swatches right there requiem as the
purple noble is the nude so the colors I
didn't mind building them up did kind of
suck but I tried Requiem on first and
I'm telling you guys I applied the
liquid lipstick I came into my office I
answered one email it really did not
take me too long I went into the
bathroom to take makeup photos and it
had already done the Krusty lip sing
like my inner rim of my lip gone it
looked horrible and I was like I've had
this on for no more than 10 minutes
there's no way I've had this on for more
than 10 minutes and I had to try to go
back reapply to take my makeup photos
and it just was kind of a hot mess and I
tried noble thinking you know maybe it's
just this one shade that's doing it I
tried Noble and it was basically the
same thing so I'm bummed out that didn't
work the liquid lipsticks our twenty
dollars and that's kind of expensive to
spend on a shade that I really can't see
myself wearing a whole lot just because
of the way they wear it would be so like
uber paranoid every time I was out so
that is kind of a bummer i'm a huge fan
of color pop liquid lipsticks and those
are six dollars i believe for their
liquid lipsticks and i think they wear
better than the kat von d i'm very
bummed but again that's just that's just
my opinion and my experience i know my
best friend has said
same thing about the kat von d liquid
lipsticks but so many people love them
maybe there's some good shades out there
everyone raves over lolita that's what
is going to be in my giveaway so
hopefully like that shade and formula is
just like the bomb and everyone loves it
but yeah that was my experience with the
kat von d so i also picked up one of the
new TARDIS lip paints from Tarte and I
picked up the shade TBT they have like
the best names ever for these shades I'm
not kidding but this is what I'm wearing
on my lips right now and I love it I'll
show you guys the applicator because it
is pretty different like if you guys
it's just like straight there's no curve
to it there's no bend to it it's it's
very interesting I read that it said
like what their applicator it's supposed
to make it super easy to apply and I
kind of don't see that because it's kind
of hard like you don't have that little
curve in there to get like on your top
lip you just have a straight line so I
had to be a lot more careful also when
you like pull this out you really have
to like pull it out because it's so
small on the top I guess to like not
overload your applicator with product
which I appreciate but I just noticed
that too but there is the shade TBT and
i love it I love the shade I love the
color I really like the formula what I
will say with the tardis lip paints and
what I'm hearing as more people are
getting it and reviewing it these do not
dry completely matte so they are not
like a cap on d liquid web sites are not
like a color pop liquid lipstick we're
after you apply it it's dry and you can
you know drink out of glasses and you're
not going to have the transfer like this
does transfer it let me see yeah can I
don't know can you guys see that and
I've had this lipstick on for probably
like 10 to 15 minutes and it still has
not dried completely down and to me when
I've worn it I think two other times it
just doesn't dry completely matte so if
you if that is what you are looking for
in your lipstick then you are not going
to like these lip paints now what I will
say about that
is that this formula is extremely
comfortable on the lips and I appreciate
that it also does not do the inner rim
thing at least for me I don't have any
worries with that I can wear this all
night long yes I might need to touch it
up if I'm like you know drinking out in
the bottle or something like that or I
just like I'm really loving on my
husband I'm going to need to reapply but
it also is easy to reapply because of
this formula it's almost like a moosey
texture and it does make it easy to
reapply it doesn't look thumbs up like a
normal liquid lipstick would so it's
different the formula is definitely
different but I appreciate it more
because it's just much more comfortable
on the lips I think it wears a lot
better it is going to transfer again so
if you do not want that in your lipstick
do not go for these but the shade the
formula like I'm all about these i'm
going to buy more there is one for you
in the 1k giveaway last thing that i got
from sephora is a make up for ever step
1 skin equalizer for whatever reason
i've used this but I saved the box and I
thought today and I was like I'm gonna
put it back in the box because that's
what all the feeds pants do on YouTube
and I want to be fancy to got the oh I
got the smoothing primer number two the
smoothing primer I've got it in just the
little guy because if you guys are
familiar with my channel like you know
how much I love little sample sizes but
i think the full-size is in the 30s like
maybe thirty seven dollars or something
I think maybe this was like 17 now I
can't remember I can put it in the
description box below but I was like why
not save some money get a little guy try
it out I still have primers that I've
been using for like a year so like why
do I need a big one and spend more money
and then I'm going to use this a few
times and then a new bomb primer is
going to come out I'm going to need to
buy it like just the head little sizes
it's so much easier I swear it's so much
easier I have used this twice it is what
i have on my face today and yeah this is
kind of bomb like everyone talks about
these primers I feel like especially the
smoothing and the Hydra
I think there's one other one that seems
to get talked about a lot and I'm like
okay I understand I have put this primer
on and it's like your face is just like
like it just it just looks better before
I even put foundation on before I put
concealer on before but anything on I
just put this primer on and I'm like
okay yeah my skin looks nice all of a
sudden it's crazy so I really like it on
you when you open it like I don't know
why but this like extreme like it like
it reminds me of like a needle like I'm
gonna get injective unlike you inject my
skin because it looks really pretty so
I'm really happy with this if you've
been on the fence about getting one of
these I would say go for it but I mean
maybe just stick with the little guy
that is everything I got four so far so
why don't we jump over to call it
alright so for color pop I'm a huge fan
of color pop I have been for I think i
placed my first order with them like in
the last spring or last summer and i
order for them very frequently i love
their liquid lipsticks I really enjoy
the lippie Stix I have a couple of their
blushes I really enjoy but I did not
have any of their eyeshadows and
kathleenlights a very popular youtuber
she recently did another collaboration
with color pop and she put out a odd
called where the night is and everyone
was really loving it so I picked that up
to go in the 1k giveaway and when I went
to place that order I was like you know
what I'm gonna buy some shadows because
I don't have any eye shadows I hear a
lot of people talk about him like I just
want to get the eyeshadows too so i did
so i picked up for myself 5i shadows and
because i bought these five by shadows
and then the kathleenlights squad I got
a free liner as well they came out with
new like gel liners in both pencil form
and platform I do also own a few of
these as well but it was I got a free
one with it so i'll show you guys that
too is pretty excited about that you
guys follow me on snapchat I do all of
my like unboxings and like when I get
any new packages in I do them all right
there too but I also
swatches on my Instagram I can post up
here if you guys want to see it but I
can share it with you here too so the
first one I got is puppy love and puppy
love was one that I was like yes like
this is one that I just so obviously
have to have because the proceeds for
this one are donated to the no-kill
shelter in LA and I'm a puppy owner a
huge puppy lover I thought that was so
cool it's only five dollars for the
shadow but so many people are buying it
so it's like that's just amazing that so
cool that they're doing it but it is
this really light pearlized shimmery
shade and actually it makes a beautiful
eye shadow it really does especially on
the inner corners but the first few
times that I used puppy love I used it
as a highlighter and I thought it looked
fantastic I'm not kidding i think it
could double as an eyeshadow and a
highlighter I thought it was beautiful
so that is puppy love and if you can see
the packaging right there it comes with
a little paw print on it yes girl
another shade I picked up is so quiche
and this shade is like the freaking bomb
can you I hope the camera is picking
that up because holy Toledo like this
one is so darn pretty it has a lot of
sparkle to it it's like an olive green
base and then it has gold sparkle in it
if you guys can see that one but it is
beautiful like an even when I was
sharing my swatch photos and posting on
snapchat this is probably the one that
people responded to the most was so
quiche like people are like holy crap
look at that one and I'm like I know I
put it all over my eyes and it's just
like well BAM like if you want to obey
them look pick up so quiche because this
color is Devon another one I picked I
picked up I picked it up it's no big
deal I picked up is mixed tape
and that's what it looks like in a
little pan okay mixtape was when I
swatch to this this was the one that I
was like oh honey this is for me it's
like a beautiful light purple but kind
of on the Mavi side time I'm like
running out of room on my hands but if
you guys didn't see that one that's like
probably the most awkward swatch in the
world but holy cow this one is so
stunning and I actually wore this in a
makeup look that I posted on Instagram
and I had some people coming back and
asked if I would do a makeup tutorial on
it and I totally am I have a tutorial
video coming up using some of these
color pop shadows and i will be using
mixtape because i think it's gorgeous I
don't have anything like this in any of
my collections and I love it so much
something about color pop shadows too
why am i dropping everything and even
like their blushes their consistency and
formula is just like so different and if
you see me like struggling to open these
is because they recommend that you
really like close them tight because
when you feel them they're like a moose
type consistency and they almost feel a
little bit wet but if you don't show
them tightly or heaven forbid you don't
cap it they can dry out and then it's
basically like game over so you don't
want to do that next one I got is plaid
and it is like a deep green and I can't
even like tell you how much I love this
shade because it is gorgeous there it is
right there I mean it's just a deep
green it's a matte shade it's stunning I
wore the other day and during the day I
just put plod all over my eyelids i
buffed like a light brown transition
shade in my crease but then I put platt
all over my eyelids that was it I didn't
have any eyeliner on nothing and I guess
just especially with me having green
eyes like my eyes just popped but when I
came home that night
it and we were going to go out I then
put so quiche on top of it mind blown
that might have been one of my like my
favorite makeup looks that I ever did
and then I realized I didn't take one
picture I didn't take one photo what I
don't know what I was thinking I don't
know why I don't know if like aliens
took over my body I don't know why I
didn't take any photos but I'm going to
do that look again because it was one of
my absolute favorite looks but this
blood oh the shade and the last color I
picked up is called Central Perk
obviously i got this because i'm a fan
of friends so that is Central Perk it's
kind of like a burgundy shade and I
don't know I kind of thought it was
going to be a little bit different from
what it is but when I got it and i
swatched it I thought that it looked
like bitten from a makeup geek and
honestly I kind of think plaid looks
like envy from makeup geek and I haven't
done side by side swatches of them yet
but I plan on doing it see if they are
dupes because that would be kind of
funny if it was but that's kind of what
it reminded me of I will do swatches
back-to-back see we can actually see and
make sure so that way if you have it and
you probably don't need Central Park and
vice versa but yeah it's a beautiful
like deep burgundy red shade it is so
pretty I actually used it in my makeup
look with mixtape I just took a little
bit of that was like a point of brush
and put it into my crease as a
definition and I feel like it really
took the look to a new level like it was
so so pretty with mixed tape and then i
put a little bit of Central Park in
there and it was just like love ever
similar I picked up I'm not mad at any
of the shades and honestly like I say
you probably need all of them I'm just
going to say it free liner that I got
and I mentioned this on snapchat that I
was a little bit bummed because I saw
their special and it was like if you buy
forty dollars with the products you get
one free liner if you buy 60 you get to
all the way up to you could get six free
liners and I was like oh my gosh there's
so
any colors that I wanted to get I love
the pencils the pencils are bomb the pot
form stay away from don't go near it
don't even click on it just buy all the
pencils that you can seriously the best
ah but I got so excited because I was
like there's so many colors that I want
and then I went through everything I put
everything in my cart and I got ready to
check out and I realized there were only
three colors you could choose from you
could choose from black brown and then
this one which is like a metallic rose
gold shade and you could choose from
either the liner or the pot or you could
get both I was like well that was kind
of a bummer I thought it was going to be
something else but I decided to get the
liner of get paid because I have this in
the platform and it's horrible and I
can't use it on my eyes and it's just
crazy but I love the color so much that
I was like okay I'll just get it in the
pencil form and cross my fingers that it
will be great I have three other pencils
and I absolutely love them I've showed
them in my color pop videos I think
they're great they're so creamy they're
so pigmented they're so smooth they last
so long they last so long i'm fairly
sure the colour-pop liners are the
longest liners to last in my waterline
ever hands down and there what what are
these six dollars five dollars they're
not expensive at all when I first place
my order and I got the get paid in the
platform it's a beautiful rose gold
metallic like i said but in the platform
it is so hard to get out like it's so
hard that it was very hard to get out of
the pot and then when i put it on like
it just does not apply smoothly it was
jagged it was falling off I have so much
fallout underneath my eyes it just
looked really really bad and it also
burned my eyes and I do have very
sensitive eyes it's hard for me to wear
glitter even some mascaras it's hard for
me to wear and so just like well you
know that sucks and then I saw this come
out and I was like I'm gonna try it
because maybe maybe the pencil or will
will work but maybe it's
just the metallic that's hurting my eyes
because the glitters can hurt my eye so
bad but like we wanna it's free I'm
going to take a chance on it whatever
nope this is perfect it's perfection
it's perfection it doesn't hurt my eyes
at all I wore it for like 10 hours the
other day and it was absolutely fine I'd
like totally run out of room it was
totally fine I didn't have any problems
with it whatsoever I was so happy with
it I love this color so much the pencils
are so easy to apply okay so it's going
to be on the top here so that is get
paid from colour-pop beautiful color
metallic rose gold really makes your
eyes stand out Ln a 999 little bottom
line is I'm gonna run out of it okay I
really reckon if I can suggest I mean I
definitely say get the pencils versus
the pots pencils are the way to go
finally that wraps up clutter pop let's
head to the last segment which is
drugstore you are a part of my snapchat
family you will understand the struggles
that I went through to get these two
items if you don't follow me on snapchat
I hope you do I'm doing so much better
at getting on there every day I'm so
proud of myself and I love talking to
you guys you guys are bomb I especially
love when you tell me where you live oh
you do those cool graphics to tell me
where you live I love that so cool but
first thing I picked up is this NYC
right yeah NYC liquid eyeliner so it
looks like this it's the eyeliner that
has this like crazy brush and everyone
talks about it on YouTube and it how
much was this like two or three dollars
I don't know it was super inexpensive
NYC is a very affordable brand but
everyone talks about it and I'm like you
know what I'm going to get it i'm going
to try it out i just ran out of another
liquid liner that i have so I'm like
gonna do it it is what i have on my eyes
today I basically have like I knew I
just really wanted to test this out so I
just left a little bit of brown into my
crease and then I did this and lashes i
will say i think it's going to take me a
couple try
to get the brush completely right and
understand how it works because I've
never used a brush before with my
eyeliner I've used felt tip pens and
I've used like the Maybelline master
graphic eyeliner but not a brush but I
think it went really well I was kind of
worried I was gonna have to like wash it
off and start over but I kept powering
through I made these wings pretty fierce
today but I was into it I really like it
I got the color extreme block in case
you're wondering but yeah I was really
happy with it like I said it's only been
one application but so far I feel like
we're going to get along pretty well
this next one is the one that my
snapchat family understands my struggle
with and it is the wet and wild contour
palette it's their mega glow contouring
palette why is it's a wet and wild mega
glow contouring palette contour oh I got
the shade the Dolce de leche no idea if
I'm saying that right hope I am that's
what it looks like and it has your
contour shade and your highlight shade
so this is something that I want it for
so long and I love our CVS I go to the
CVS like every single week I think
they're bomb com and I could not find
the stinking contour palette it reminded
me a line of the Marc Jacobs palette
which is why I wanted it because you
know why not and it couldn't find it and
I was saying something on snapchat and
so many people are responding back to me
and saying like I can't find out CBS
either go to walmart or walgreens so i
went to walmart that's where I got the
NYC liquid liner but they were
completely out of this one they had the
darker shade which i think is like
caramel toffee but I figured that would
be too dark for me so then I went to
walgreens and I hate walgreens oh my god
do I hate walgreens so much i can't
believe i went in there but i found it
it was in the greeting card section i
didn't understand what was going on but
i found it and i bought it very happy i
did then i went to CVS yesterday to pick
up a few more items and guess what was
there you know how unhappy I was
oh I'm so unhappy let's move on we got
it that's all that matters I'm wearing
it today I really love it I was so
worried out saying my snaps like I'm
gonna get home and just absolutely hate
this and it's going to be such a waste
but no this powder oh but it feels so
nice ok so those are what they look like
on my fingers and like find a spot to
swatch it here I'll swatch it on this
hand I don't know can you tell from
those swatches on my hand how nice they
are because they are really really nice
and I totally just like stuck my thumb
in it too that's awesome yeah ok fair we
can break it yeah this contour shade oh
I love it so I tried it this morning and
I you know I started started putting it
on and I was like it makes such a pretty
shadow I was so excited I honestly don't
have a whole lot of like straight
contour shades and so I got when I was
like this is gonna be worth it I don't
know and I put it on and I was so happy
with it the highlight shade I think
works really well especially with my
skin tone it's light it's almost got
like a peachy pink undertone to it but I
thought it worked really well I have it
under my eyes and my forehead my nose my
Cupid's bow and my chin and I thought it
worked really well so far I mean first
impressions like first first impressions
I've probably only had it on for like
six hours I'm really happy with it I'm
very glad I got it thankfully it was
worth it the few more items in this hole
is over but I needed to pick up a few
new makeup remover wipes and so I just
got the Neutrogena ones if you watch my
empties video you'll know that I
absolutely hate it the pink grapefruit
wipes because they just like really
irritated my eyes because apparently
they just have a bunch of alcohol in
them which one of my subscribers told me
thank you for that because my bad I
didn't look at the ingredients but these
I loved it she like tried and true and I
saw it when I was like I'm just going
back to the regular blue ones so that's
not very exciting but picked up a new
nail color from the sally hansen gel
miracle
and i love this nail polish I feel like
I'm buying a new shade all the time but
this is in headbang and it is the color
that I'm wearing right now you guys can
see that it's like a it's like a brown
but it's like a plummy brown like it's
not just like chocolate brown it's got a
little bit a little bit something
something in there I really like it i
used the 3d gel top coat with it and
I've had it on for probably about 24
hours now and we're still looking good
no chips no cracks good and I picked up
was from the OGX line and it is they're
weightless oil and lifting tonic I just
got this little bottle but it was still
like nine dollars mm-hmm and then I got
home when I was like wait it's only down
here like what a ripoff but actually
this must be like the oil up here and
then to use it you have to like shake it
really well that mixes it all together
and then you're supposed to spray it on
your hair you can use a dry or wet and
it says discover luscious body and
hydration with this breezy light blend
with advanced oxygen technology and
cloud berry extract this fresh formula
moisturizes volumizes and breathes life
and define hair I don't know we'll see
because I have extremely fine hair I
really do need to get my hair done like
it's it's just not been pretty the last
few days I actually wore my hair up in
my previous video I never do that
because I'm very self-conscious about my
years but I did it because I just didn't
know what else to do with it but I just
feel like it's looking so lifeless
lately that i saw this i had a coupon I
was like whatever let's just do it i
think it was like six dollars my coupon
but i'll let you guys know what I think
I sprayed it in a few hours ago and I
guess I feel like it looks maybe a
little bit fuller because when I'm
saying like I have like very fine limp
hair like I read my hair was like it was
kind of gross looking and I feel like it
gave me like a little bit of body but I
definitely want to try it out with damp
