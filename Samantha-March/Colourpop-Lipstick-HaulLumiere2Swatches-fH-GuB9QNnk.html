video and for like a spur-of-the-moment
video I just got a new color pop package
in the mail and it features the new
Lumiere 2 liquid lipstick that
kathleenlights create it with color pop
so I got the package and it's usually
like it's a 2 hours after I would
normally film a video but I'm like I'm
gonna film it because I want to put this
on and I want to show you guys some of
the other lippies that I got so I hope
this doesn't come off as too rush but
I'm like it's about to get like
pitch-black here but I just really
wanted to show you guys my haul I wanted
to show you guys Lumiere - if you guys
are still wondering if you want to
purchase it so let's hop guys are not
familiar with Lumiere - this is it right
here
but basically kathleenlights she is a
well-known youtuber she has collaborated
with color pop on several occasions and
she made a Lumiere lippy stick back in
the day and she just released this was
like a surprise release no one knew it
was happening it released on her
birthday and I remember waking up that
morning and getting on Instagram and
everyone was like oh my god Lumiere -
Lumiere's now in a liquid lipstick and I
was like what what should I buy it okay
and so I just bought it I was like half
asleep when I bought it and I was like
I'm gonna buy it because it looked so
pretty Kathleen put out a video about it
did the swatches for it and I was like
this looks like a lipstick I could
really get behind I love the color pop
ultra matte liquid lipsticks I have
probably over ten right now I would say
and I love them I do think their
formulas are getting better I can tell
from the first liquid lipsticks that I
bought they do dry pretty fiercely and
can kind of do the inner lip thing and
then from the second color pop order
that I got which include it like chili
chili the formula feels much more
comfortable on the lips and then I just
here like it just keeps getting better
so I'm like okay so I'm gonna try it so
this is the Lumiere 2 and it is what I'm
wearing on
right now of course I was so excited to
get it and holy crap I love this color I
figured I love the color obviously
because why else would I buy it if I
didn't think I would love to come up
love the color but I love it way more
than I thought I would at least from
first impressions it is so stunning so
here is a swatch on my hand isn't it
just so beautiful
oh and I'm so happy with this color and
I got it because I honestly don't have a
whole lot of Pink's in my collection for
some reason I have like Reds and moths
and browns and I have light Pink's but I
just did not feel like I had anything
like this in my collection and I knew I
wanted to get it and I am so so happy
with it so far like I put it on and then
I finished up my makeup like when I say
this is for the moment this is like my 5
minute makeup look for short like one
eyeshadow color a winged liner eyelashes
and some Luminoso blush from Milani and
I'm like ok good to know I gotta get
this filmed but I put it on and I
finished up putting my makeup on and
then I looked in the mirror again and I
was like oh girl your lipstick look good
I was so excited I can't even tell you
guys how freaking pumped I am for this
color if you guys have been going back
and forth you're not sure if you want to
get Lumiere to I say go for it the ultra
matte liquid lipsticks are six dollars
like you cannot beat that price now I do
not have the first Lumiere I did not get
the lippy stick of it so I can't do a
comparison swatch to that but I did
order the Lumiere lip liner so I can do
a swatch of that one too but I'm loving
it here's the swatch again I will be
sharing these swatches on my Instagram
as well so if you don't follow me on
Instagram I will link it below but be
sure to follow me there because I share
all the swatches there as well as on
snapchat
I haven't even filmed this first
snapshot yet I literally got the package
and was like I need to film this video
right now through some makeup on got in
front of the camera so so happy
okay so then also in my package let's
bust out what else I have in here okay
so also I picked up in the liquid lip
the color clueless
I will admit I kind of got it on the
name because I'm such a huge clueless
fan I'm like who can't I mean like I
can't not have clueless in my collection
right yeah this is pretty oh yeah yeah
I'm gonna like this one
ooh yeah okay so that is clueless and
next to Lumiere 2 so it's definitely
like a lighter pink but that Mavi pink
as well it reminds me a little bit maybe
of salò solo from colour-pop but I can
do swatches side by side too for
Instagram of that one but it looks a
little bit not solo I think it's more of
like a brighter pink and this one is
definitely more of the mob
so that is clueless and wooo yeah I'm
not like that you guys want me to swatch
I here I'll swatch solo right now this
is my if you guys have like good
organization for your color pop please
let me know because I would love to know
what you guys do that's dress okay cuz
this is like so hard when you're trying
to find something deeper here we go
solid let me swatch that alone next to
this one just so we can see totally
different totally different okay so the
Solow is next to it and yeah definitely
like what I thought it's just a brighter
pink we're clueless is more of the Mabi
pink oh so happy okay so also and bag
let's see what we got next
ooh this one is called teeny-tiny
seriously like cute name too right and I
feel like these are all gonna be in the
same color family about it
okay so teeny tiny whoo this one's
pretty fun is different okay so that is
teeny tiny the last watch there this is
definitely much deeper okay a teeny tiny
teeny tiny is kind of reminding me a
little bit of chilli chilli so I will
swatch those side by side as well so
that one is teeny tiny
yeah it's definitely a deeper mouth
Brown looks like it has a lot of brown
undertones in it let me swatch Chile
Chile next to it got it in one but
they're definitely similar but different
okay so the first one is teeny tiny and
then the one right next to it is Chile
Chile
so you can tell like same color family
but they are different teeny tiny is
definitely more of like the deeper mauve
and Chile Chile is like the reddish
brown okay let's just keep the other guy
having way too much fun here clearly
okay so next some for you guys maybe so
next is
Lumiere too so I had to get you guys one
as well I just reached 1000 subscribers
on YouTube excited I'm so happy it to
know that you guys are enjoying watching
my videos that I make in my office in my
home in my slap hands recording on my
phone because I can't afford a camera
yet like thank you so much I feel like
I'm gonna get emotional and I'm going to
try not to it was good god big eyelashes
on whoa winged liner can't have no tears
with that but thank you so much it means
so much to me
I'm so excited I started at YouTube
literally just an idea that I had one
day at home seeing a bunch of people do
like booktube videos and I thought I can
do that too I can reach more people I
can connect with more people social
media has been my job for seven years
like I need to be on YouTube as well and
to know that you guys enjoy these videos
and to see the connections that I'm
already making with you guys it's
absolutely incredible so thank you so
much I'll be doing a full video so I
don't want to get into this too much but
thank you thank you but to celebrate
1,000 subscribers I've been putting
together a really big makeup giveaway if
you follow me on snapchat or Instagram
you see I have like the Kat Von D
like contour palette I have a glam glow
mask for you guys I have a couple of
drugstore items in there I have some
liquid lipsticks from Kat Von D's from
Tarte and when I saw this come out and I
knew I was gonna get one for myself I
was like I gotta get one for my
subscribers too
I I think I'm going to love this color
so much and hopefully they will as well
so I had to pick one up for you guys so
this one will be included in the 1000
subscriber giveaway if you are not

sure you are subscribed because that
video is coming very very soon and you
do need to be subscribed to get enter to
win so make sure you're subscribed
because this will also be included in
and then I get wake up to of the lip
liners I hear a lot of good things about
the lip liners and I never purchase any
because I honestly don't use lip liners
a whole lot but I hear so many fantastic
things I love that you don't have to
sharpen them because I can't find a
pencil sharpener right now to save my
life so I have a couple lip liners back
here that are so dull I can't use but I
can't find I've looked at all so I
looked at before I've looked at
Walgreens I can't find a pencil
sharpener just saved my freakin life not
gonna lie and my husband had one in the
basement and we used it and I don't know
why but it just chewed up my next lip
liner and I was like well I'm glad I
gave you my next one first instead of my
Mac whirl won't do that again but I'm
glad you don't have to sharpen them I
hear really good things about them I see
people use the lip liner as a full like
lip color and I'm like you know what I'm
gonna get to and test it out I wanted to
get the Lumiere pencil just because I
was getting the liquid lipstick I was
like I might as well get the pencil with
it as well I don't have the pencil on
today I just wanted to wear it Lumiere 2
as by itself to test it out for the
first time that I'm wearing it but these
are what the lip pencils look like and
then I will swatch this one as close to
Lumiere 2 as I can okay so that is the
lip liner swatch right there so it does
definitely obviously look similar to it
but it's a little bit lighter so I'll be
really excited to use this I think I I
know that I have so many different lip
combinations that I can use with this
type of color so very excited and
the other lipliner I got is in oh snap
it just looked like an interesting color
to me I've been seeing a couple people
use it in their like makeup tutorials it
just broke oh it broke what do you what
what do you do okay so oh snap broke and
I guess you can't I guess once they're
done they're done you you don't get to
sharpen them or do anything with them so
um I guess I'll probably have to eat my
little colour pop because here's oh snap
their third there it is so that's a
bummer I just open the cap and it fell
right off it look like it had already
been broken once in there but that's
really sad has anyone else had that
happen to them there's no snap I'm
obviously not gonna swatch it because
it'll just fall apart again
but bummer but I thought you could like
I mean I get I don't know I guess you
can't sharpen them or do anything with
them so once you use them they're done
they're only five dollars so I guess
that's not a huge deal but well that's a
bummer
that's a sad way to end a haul right
that's a pretty sad way to end a haul
but at least I still have my Lumiere lip
pencil that I can try out hopefully I
like it now I feel like I'm gonna be
paranoid every time I go to open this
that is just gonna come flying out
I guess I'll contact colour-pop I don't
know if they would even like send me a
new one or I don't know what they would
do but I'll at least give it a try to
contact them because that's kind of a
bummer but still excited I can still at
least it didn't happen with Lumiere
because this was the lip pencil I was
really excited for I just kind of
grabbed oh snap on a whim to have
another lip pencil in hand but yeah okay
then so that's everything that I got in
my father pop border dang it I can't
believe it and that is everything that I
got in my color pop order that kind of
is a bummer that it ended
on a broken product note but hey real
life I'd mean that stuff happens I'm
kind of sad about it I guess I can give
you guys an update life you know what
color pop lets me know in case this
happens to any of you guys and you
wonder like how their customer service
works I truly have no idea this did
happen to me once with another company I
think it was an eyeliner that I got was
either an island or a lip liner and I
opened it and it fell right off and you
couldn't resharpen it and I contacted
them and they never even got back to me
so I don't know what color pop will do
but I can let you guys know give you an
update under what they say I'm so bummed
because I really wanted to try oh snap
but that's okay that's alright I'll get
over it look at all these beautiful new
lippies that I can use if you guys want
to see here's a close-up of the swatches
again now that they are all dried to
their matte finish so I feel like
they're you know they're pretty
different teeny tiny is definitely the
darkest one out there
Lumiere to us I think is so beautiful
and clueless I cannot wait to use I'm so
happy that it doesn't look like I got
any like repeat colors which since
they're from the same brand you know
usually they don't things will be
similar but they're not going to be
exactly the same but they're actually a
lot more different than I thought they
would be with like their color matches
that I had in mind
so that really excites me but I hope you
guys enjoyed this quick little spur the
moment haul please give it a thumbs up
if you do be sure to check my Instagram
because I'll be sharing more swatch
photos as well and snapchat I'm always
on there talking to you guys it's like
become my weird obsession to do I can't
stop looking our guys at snaps I love
talking to you I think you guys are all
bomb loved it so be sure to follow me on
those social media accounts make sure
you are subscribed because that 1k
giveaway video will be coming very soon
and your own Lumiere 2 will be a part of
that giveaway because I hope you guys
enjoyed this I hope you find it helpful
I hope if you were on the fence about
getting Lumiere 2 I say you go for it
because it looks absolutely stunning it
feels so comfortable I probably hide it
on my lips now for half an hour I don't
feel like when some of the earlier ones
like I said you can feel it drying like
within 10
of putting it on I don't feel that
happening right now it is transfer proof
I just kissed my hand there's nothing on
my hand so you won't get any transfer
which I absolutely love I'm so glad that
I got this color before Valentine's Day
because you can bet this is what I'm
gonna be wearing on date night with my
husband it's beautiful it's not gonna
get all over him he's gonna appreciate
me for that but yes I hope you guys
