today so today's video is going to be a
makeup tutorial on this look right here
it is a cool toned makeup look using the
Kat Von D shade + light eye palette this
is the look that i will be using for my
Christmas card photo that i will be
taking with my family coming up here
soon and someone had requested that look
so i was thinking about it and this like
cool tone grey I is just a look that
I've been going was so much lately and
then paired with the nude lip I've just
been loving it so I've decided that
that's what I'm going to do for my
holiday card so i thought i would film
this for you i ended up doing more of a
cat I then just like a regular winged
liner than I thought I was going to do
but so now it's my cool toned cat eye
makeup tutorial look but if you would
like to see how I got this look please
keep watching hey guys so first I'm
going to go in with my primer and I'm
using the Maybelline master prime my
face to do the blur and illuminate
primer it is like the pink one and i
actually do my eyes first so after this
step then i move on to my eyes but I do
my primer first quite honestly because I
tend to forget it so when i'm doing a
look that I really know that I want my
primer to be on for I tend to just do it
first that way I don't forget a lot of
times like I finished my eyes or the
part of my eyes that I want to do first
I'm like yes foundation and then I put
foundation on I'm like oh no primers so
that's what I'm doing first and what I'm
going to do to prime my eyes is use the
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
and I'm going to put it like all over my
eyelids and then also down around my
eyes to help cover the dark circles so
I'm like starting the concealing process
even though after i'm done i'm going to
come back in and conceal a little bit
more but basically I
I've just been really loving using
concealer as my eye primer so that's I'm
doing that and I'm putting it like I
really struggle with the dark circles
like right here right on the inner
corners of my eye so I'm making sure to
get it there and just kind of around my
eyes I'm not doing the full like
highlighting procedure yet this is
mostly just for the concealing part and
then I'm going to buff that in with my
pro airbrush concealer brush it's number
57 from Sephora and all of the products
that I mentioned in brushes that I use
etc will be listed in the description
box below of course times with this part
i tend to use a brush versus my Beauty
Blender and then sometimes when i'm
doing like the actual like highlighting
part with the concealer I'll use my
Beauty Blender but if I haven't done
this step ok does that make any sense so
if i only use like a I primer or just a
little bit of concealer and I haven't
brought the concealer all the way around
and I'm like concealing my whole I then
when I highlight i use my Beauty Blender
if I do this step like this first with a
little bit heavier concealer then I
don't use my Beauty Blender I have no
idea why it's just my preference I just
thought I'd throw that out there because
I really do like my Beauty Blender for
this but for some reason when I'm doing
this I just prefer to use my brush we
all have our weird makeup work right for
my eyes I'm using the Kat Von D shade of
light I pellet this is what the inside
of the palette looks like so i'll be
using shades only out of here this is
the only shadows that i'll be using on
my eyes first I'm going to come in with
my big fluffy blending brush and this is
from bh cosmetics and I'm going to use
this like PG shadow over here latest or
something like that I think it's called
this has a big mirror which is really
nice but just get some product on there
tap it out and then
I'm applying this directly in my crease
just back and forth and with this being
my transition shade I'm bringing that
shade like up towards my eyebrow versus
down I'm just going to use a brown to
deepen it up just a little bit i'm going
to use this second brown i think it's
called citri and i'm going to use the
same blending brush just get a little
bit of product on there tap it out and
then I'm going to put it still in my
crease but I'm not going to bring it
like up as high because i want that
first transition shade to be like the
top color and then this brown is going
to blend into it yeah
and I am bringing it you know like
pretty far in but I'm mostly focusing
this color on the outer half of my eye
and then when there's you know basically
no product left on my brush I'm just
gonna go back and forth a few times and
blend those two shades together and then
I'm going to go in with my Sigma
blending brush this is the e25 and I'm
going to pick up this gray shadow love
liver right us liberate us look at these
names in this palette are quite kooky
but I'm going to pick up that gray color
and that's really good as well Kuna is
what is going to make this like the cool
Tom look because so far we've used like
the peach shade is pretty warm the brown
is more on the cool side and then this
gray is really what is making it the
cool tone makeup look and you really
don't need a lot of product on your
brush for this like that's how much i'm
going to start off with and with the
gray because it's darker i always
suggest building it up because if you
put too much on and then you're kind of
like II crap but if you slowly build it
up a friend that it really helps and
what I'm doing with this one is I want
like I'm going to Pat it into my crease
at the end and then just focus it
basically on the outer V and once I
start to not have as much product on my
brush then I'm going to swoop it in
towards the inner corner of my eye but I
don't want to do it too much too soon so
I just Pat it up here like this start
kind of the blending process keep it
focused on the outer V
and then slowly work it into the inner
corner as well here it's just blending
blending blending adding more color if
you want to add more color and just
blending until it is blended to your
satisfaction but the goal is to have
most of the gray focused right here in
that outer V and have it kind of like
gradient in towards the inner eye then
after you've gotten both eyes how you
want them I come back in with the fluffy
blending brush that should have no
product on it and I just do another
blend of all the shades that you got
going on so far and then this is a good
time to look it over like right now it I
want it to be a little bit greater so
then I'm just going to go back in with
my sigma brush put a little bit more of
the grey on there and basically just
repeat the whole process working on my
outer V slowly working it in and then
blending it out I'm just going to take
my base but big fluffy blending brush
give it one more blend then I think i'm
good at the hardest part hope that i'm
going to come in with just like a
regular flat shader brush this one is
from bh cosmetics and I'm going to grab
this really white shade right here Pat
that onto my brush and Pat it focusing
on the inner corner of my eyes and then
slowly working it over my entire eyelid
to kind of bring this whole cool tone
look together and with this Kat Von D
shade and light palette all the shades
are matte so this is a matte white shade
and so you'll just kind of
keep adding until you get it to the
white color that you want I keep it
focused on my eyelid I don't bring it
past my crease can you see me hopefully
I didn't get out of focus there yeah
this thing I'll just go in one more time
so use that same white shadow in just
the same brush I just put a little bit
on the brush and then I use this as like
um my eye brow highlight as well just
really lightly nothing nothing really
crazy here if you don't do eyebrow
highlights feel free to skip it's not
the most needed thing in the world once
that is done I come in back in with the
big fluffy blending brush and I just
blend all of that together so there is
no harsh lines between the work that
we've already done and the white that
we've placed on there sometimes doing
this ache in lesson the white shade so
sometimes I mean you'll just want to
gauge and see what you might want to go
back in out a little bit more white
blend again I mean it just depends on
the look that you're going for how many
times you want to go back in and do it
and then I do one more step before I
move on and start to work on my face a
little bit and I actually come back to
the eyes but i'm going to do eyeliner
neck i'm going to be using my maybelline
by I studio it's their gel eyeliner and
it is an blackest black if you can tell
by the little pot here that is pretty
loved I like using gel eyeliner um for
like longer lasting makeup looks because
I just feel like the gel eyeliner stays
longer than the lip liner and today is
much longer than pencil liner so that's
why I use the gel did I already show you
my brush I don't think I did this is the
Sigma small angle the e65 brush I love
using an angled brush a small angled
brush like this for doing a winged
eyeliner I think it's really helpful
when doing it after i get a little bit
of
addict on my brush I start like kind of
in the middle of my eye and brush a
little on there and then I actually
start my wing so when I was doing my
eyeshadow and I was focusing on the
outer V I kind of was already creating
my guide for where my eyeliner is going
to be what you can do you can use like
tape to help you with this you can grab
like like an angled edge like a lot of
people will use like the adhesive for
your fake eyelashes the little tube has
a nice little edge on it that you can
use if you're not sure how to get that
yet I have done it enough times that I'm
okay doing it without for this look in
particular but that's kind of like how
I'm going to do my wing as I've kind of
already etched it out for myself which
is nice but then also a lot of times
when I do when the eyeliner I come back
in with concealer and clean it up I am
assuming I'm going to do it in this look
I don't know yet cuz let's just let's
just keep it moving but I take I'll take
my brush and kind of follow like where
my lower lash line is I'll just kind of
act like I'm gonna keep drawing on that
lower lash line up towards the tail of
my eyebrow and this is really hard to do
on camera just an FYI
I'll go in and I'll keep going
I'll go back in get a little bit more
product on my brush and then I flip my
brush and I find the wing that I made it
that I've already made and go about as
far up as you would like I start about
here and just swoop it down and then I
just keep filling in along the rest of
my eye i'll probably leave the wing
alone for a little bit until i do my
other eye I made it thicker then I
normally would I blame being on camera
but I don't hate it and I'll say that I
normally would like probably for family
pictures I probably wouldn't make the
wing like quite this thick and intense
but it works for this look I'm also not
doing fake lashes for the look so
sometimes if i'm not doing fake lashes
i'll do a thicker wing just because I
feel like it helps like kind of add more
emphasis so I'm not mad but I will say
it's a little bit thicker than I would
do for my family pictures but then again
like I don't do false eyelash or
somewhere feel and pictures some people
would etc it's just it's just your
comfort zone just your comfort zone then
I'm going to go ahead and do the other
eye the same way and this sometimes can
be the hardest part is trying to make
your wings even but I just follow along
that same route I go along my lower
lashline create the wing and then
connect it I think I've managed to get
them pretty darn even and then I just
look at the wings because i usually just
make like a really small tail and i do
it up towards my eyebrow so then I just
kind of make sure this one is the same
and I use like the small pointed end of
the brush and just kind of flick it up
and again so as of right now I actually
don't think I need to come in with the
concealer but if I would I just put the
concealer wherever
need to sharpen up the wing like maybe
like right here I would do the concealer
and then I use just a very small angle
brush like that that's one is from
bhcosmetics and I would just use it and
kind of like blend it out but I think
since I've made them like thick and
that's the look that we're going for
we're just gonna we're just going to
roll with that look eyeliner I lied when
I stopped getting the shadows where you
want them and blend it is the hardest
part winged eyeliner it's no joke okay
then i'm going to leave the eyes alone
for a hot minute and move on to some of
my face so i'm going to be using the
maybelline fit me matte and poreless a
foundation the reason why i like to use
this is because there is no SPF in it
which means when i use photography
especially flash photography that you
won't get that like white glare
flashback and so whenever i'm doing
anything that involves a lot of pictures
even if it's just like a girls night out
but i'm like who and no we're going to
take pictures tonight i will try to use
a foundation that does not have the SPF
in it because then i just think the
pictures turn out so much butter
unfortunately this foundation does not
have a pump so you have to literally
just pour it out on your hand which is
the worst part about this foundation and
then i'm going in with my Sigma f80 flat
kabuki brush and just going to apply
this to my face I also bring it down
onto my neck as well and then just start
to blend it all in together I usually
like bring it pretty far down onto my
neck like over onto my earlobes I try to
get it up into my hairline just so
there's no d'marco fication at all and
then in order to like make sure i'm
getting all around my lips I mean I
really like go over my lips to which
then your lips will look really funny
until you put your lipstick on but
sometimes if I like I would find when I
would try to like avoid my lips I would
then leave like literally like a white
circle around my mouth because I was
for some reason afraid of getting it
getting like foundation on my lips and
then that's just not cute so just blend
in your foundation going to do some
actual concealing once again and i'm
using the maybelline fit me concealer
and i'm just going to put a little bit
under my eyes since I already did quite
a bit of concealer like I'm only going
to put a little bit down here to help
brighten it since we put the foundation
on a little bit on my forehead down the
bridge of my nose on my Cupid's bow and
on my chin just to highlight a little
bit
and I don't usually go really overboard
with this step honestly I just don't
interests at me like some people like
load up their face for this part it's
just not my preference that you do you
always just do you now go back in with
my Sephora number 57 brush and just
blend it out so this part even though
I'm not like really doing this part to
sharpen my wings I mean you still kind
of can you can use that concealer and
your brush or your finger or whatever it
is you want to use and just kind of
sharpen it up if you think you need it
I will go in and set my concealer but I
don't do that until a few steps later
and I'll explain why then after a few
steps that I do I just go in and kind of
like blend everything out and I'm just
using it's actually a blush brush by
Real Techniques by just kind of run it
over my face blend everything out make
sure we don't have any like harsh lines
going on the foundation that I use is a
little bit darker than my skin tone
right now so it actually gave me some
color so i don't think i'm going to go
in and use any bronzer simply because i
just don't feel like I really need it
today so just make sure everything is
blended in and then I'm going to go back
in and finish I might not come back in
to the Kat Von D shade in light palette
i'm using my two favorite brushes to use
for underneath my eye one is a flat
definer brush another one is almost like
a bigger pencil brush it has like at the
pointed end and first I'm going to come
in and grab this second brown shade that
we use after our transition color I'm
going to use the flat definer brush and
just smudge it along my lower lash line
between those two eyeshadow shades I'm
going to use the knicks trays you'll a
gel eyeliner pencil and the shade is in
black and i'm going to put this on my
lower waterline
and then I'm going to grab this brush
from bhcosmetics I'm going to grab the
gray shade again and then smudge all of
this together on my lower lashline and I
have a package from UPS I'm going I'm
going to use mascara today is mascara
I'm using the Hypnose drama this is by
Lancome this is my little sample version
that I got in my lash stash to go I
actually have really ended up enjoying
this mascara I think it works great
that's what the Wanda looks like like i
said i'm not using fake eyelashes today
because that's just not what i would do
in my photos and I'm sorry my dog is now
whining at the dork she doesn't
understand why someone would just come
to the door and then leave her are and
then I'm going to come in and set it and
why I do it this fight is because I like
to basically just avoid any mascara
because there will be times where like
clumps of mascara will fall on under
here and then I can just take my setting
powder and fix it right up and we're all
good to go so I'm using the Rimmel stay
matte translucent powder and an elf
small tapered brush and I'm just going
to put that on any place where I put
that concealer and that's just to help
it stay in place and to also help it
avoid creasing finish up my face I'm
going to be using this Milani blush this
is in dolce pink I'm just using a blush
brush from bhcosmetics putting that on
the apples of my cheeks I think this is
a really pretty pink blush and it has
like just a little bit of like sparkle
shimmer to it and I tend to put a little
bit more blush on than like maybe I
normally would because blush tends to be
the first thing to go and I don't think
this Milani blush is particularly long
testing so I put on a little bit more
than I might normally for pictures I so
it stays a be civil it shows up then I'm
just going to run this blending brush
over it again real quick like to make
sure everything is going to finish off
the base with some highlighter so i'm
using this elf flawless concealer brush
and going in with the becca and jaclyn
hill champagne pop highlighter and i'm
just going to add that highlight to the
tops of my cheekbones a little bit down
the bridge of my nose and right here on
the tip of my nose and then a little bit
on my Cupid's bow and then i usually go
back in for at least one more dip and go
on the tops of my cheekbones again and
to finish off the look with my lips i'm
going to be using the mac whirl lip
liner and then the cookie lippie Stix
from call it from Mac world if you guys
saw why did I mention this in my last
video and I was like if someone could
please send me a pencil sharpener that'd
be great no one has sent me a pencil
sharpener yet try not to be mad but I
heard all I went to Alta and I could not
find a pencil sharpener wasn't that
weird I'll they sell them there but I'm
just going to line my lips
then I'm going to fill them in with the
cookie lippy stick from color pops and
this is a matte lipstick and it's just a
really pretty neutral brown and then
paired with the like pinkish brown whirl
I just think it makes a really pretty
combination and like natural with a
little bit of emphasis which I really
like for photos because I'm not someone
who wears like bright red lipstick at my
family pictures you know what I'm saying
but again you do you if you want to wear
your bright lip you go ahead and do it
and this I works really well with if you
want to do the bright red lip if you
want to do even like a pink lip it looks
really good I don't love the gray lip
with the gray I I just think it like I
don't like the way it looks but nude is
probably my favorite combo and then just
to set everything in place I use the mac
fix+ I definitely recommend using some
sort of settings bright alright so this
is the finished result but this is my
cool tone cat eye makeup look even
though I didn't really know what I was
going to be doing the cat eye look but
this is my cool tone cat eye look this
is what I personally will be using for
my upcoming family photos that I will be
taking with my husband and my dog so I
hope this kind of give you an idea if
you're still looking for an idea for
your family card again normally I
wouldn't actually do a cat eye for
family photos but that's how it turned
out for me today and who knows i'll take
some photos and see if I like it but it
might actually just recreate this whole
look when we do our family photos again
you can change it a little bub if you
want but just this is just an idea and
the cool tone that look from the kat von
d palette it's just one that I've been
using so much lately so I really wanted
to do a tutorial on it I hope you guys
like this video about it helpful
enjoyable please give it a thumbs up if
you did sure to subscribe before you go
if you have any other makeup tutorial
ideas that you
like to share with me please do comment
below and I will check those out I don't
think I have any coming up on my list I
do have a Murphy palette coming and i
will be doing some sort of tutorial on
that but i'm not sure yet what that will
be so if you have any other ideas please
