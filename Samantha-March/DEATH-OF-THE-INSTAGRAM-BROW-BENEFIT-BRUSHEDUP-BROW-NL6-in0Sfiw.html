to be a hopefully a fun one I really
kind of have no idea what I'm doing
that's a really great way to kick off a
video but basically what we're going to
be doing is talking about eyebrows and
the death of the Instagram eyebrow so a
couple weeks ago I saw the benefit
cosmetics they do have a youtube channel
which I'll a link down below but they
came out with a video it was all about
the brushed up brow and the title of
their video was the death of the
Instagram brow and you know I clicked on
that and you know I watched it maybe you
don't know if you're new to my channel
welcome my name is Samantha and I really
don't like doing my breath I don't like
it i don't i don't like it i understand
it it makes me uncomfortable I don't do
them right and I'd never really thought
about eyebrows ever until i started
youtube until i started instagram and i
had people from all over the world
telling me how ridiculous i look how
horrible my brows look what a terrible
person i am that i don't do my brows I
was like whoa whoa whoa whoa what you're
not new to my channel you know so maybe
you're like thinking like what is she
gonna do this video where are we going
with this but when i saw that benefit
put out the brush Dubrow trend i was
like you know what i want to try it
fingers crossed that it works out for me
and maybe this trend will actually like
happen and people will want to do it and
then we can leave other people alone
about eyebrows because there are so many
bigger problems in the world that this
why brought then continues to puzzle me
every single day but what benefit was
doing in their video was only using two
products and it's all about I really
like natural almost kind of more like
edgy type of eyebrow look getting rid of
like the pencils on the eyebrows and the
super defined eyebrows and the eyebrows
that take you an hour to do and if you
mess up you have to wash your whole face
off and do them again I typically do not
have time for something like that so I
was like okay I'm gonna give it a try
and why not try it out on camera I've
never done this before I've been waiting
for a time to be able to film it so I've
never done it I've never tried it a
little bit nervous about it I have no
idea if it's going to work but we're
gonna try we're going to test out
benefit
cosmetics and their brush Dubrow trend
we're going to see what we get so you're
only using two products so i'm using the
goof proof pencil which in their video
they did use the precisely my brow
pencil because i think it's just a
little bit smaller and more precise but
i don't have that one but i do have the
goof proof and then the Ready Set brow
so I will leave these link down below
these are the only two products that
you're supposed to need I will say that
with this trend I think that you do need
more like fuller eyebrows to be able to
do this if you only have like a few
hairs or you have really really sparse
eyebrows I don't think this is going to
be a trend that you're able to do so
you're going to have to keep penciling
on your eyebrows I'm really sorry I
don't I didn't make the rules guys if I
could make the rules I would make the
rules different but I do just want to
say that so I'm going to try this real
quick we're going to see if it works
we're going to see what happens and then
I'll give a little bit of a PSA at the
end as well because that was another
reason why I wanted to make this video
but let's just go ahead let's give it a
try so first I'm taking the goof proof
pencil and I'm taking the spoolie side
and the first thing that you do is brush
up your brows like so I could zoom you
in a little closer for this I did just
wake up I'm sick and I'm so tired that
it's like it hurts to keep my eyes open
you know like every time I blank I'm
like just cut a slice just go to sleep
but no that's not we're working on our
eyebrows right now so I got bigger
things to do okay so once you brush up
the brows and then I'm going to take the
other edge of the pencil which is the
product side and in the video they just
very like casually like filled in any
sparse areas kind of played at the front
a little bit I mean it was like super
quick not a lot of detail not a lot of
time spent on it so that's what I'm
going to do here so I'm going to fill in
a little bit at the front and then I
kind of have some sparse areas back here
and then when they were filling in like
towards the end they started to instead
of filling in like straight like a brow
they would like flick upwards and
outwards
so we're going to go ahead and try that
as well and they went all the way down
to the edge of the brow upwards and
outwards okay all right so I'm gonna try
the same thing at the other one so fill
in the front a little and then do the
outward and upward strokes and then they
took the spoolie side again and once
again rushed everything up
and then once you do that the brow is
done besides for the clear brow gel so
then after this I'm going to take the
Ready Set brow it's just a clear brow
gel and then you run this this is not
ready set brow this is gimme brow that
would have been bad if I just want to
run that through my eyebrows hold on let
me grab my right eyebrow okay this is my
Ready Set brow and it is just a clear
brow gel so looks like this so then you
just run this through the eyebrows as
well again going in like the upward
motion
always so once you have that done the
brows are complete leave but this is the
brush of a brow trend that benefit
cosmetics shared recently i'll go ahead
and see me an even more okay so here is
a close up of the brows what would you
try the brushed of brow trend do you
like it do you think you might work for
you let us know in the comments okay so
I have the brushed up browse going on so
they definitely are edgy I will say that
I honestly as this is the very first
time that I'm doing it first time I'm
seeing it with me having the brushed up
brow trend it was super easy it was very
fast very quick didn't use a lot of
product and that was great I don't know
if I love it though honestly it just it
kind of reminds me a little bit of when
I did like the werewolves halloween
tutorial and I am focused on like having
like the brushed up kind of wild and
crazy browse it's kind of what it's
reminding me up and giving me those type
of vibes but I don't know I feel like
I'd have to like really be in the mood
to be able to do this I'm not sure that
this would just be like an everyday brow
type of thing and I'm not gonna lie you
guys when I go out on an everyday basis
even if I go out somewhere nice or fancy
or fun or clever or whatever I promise
you that half the time I don't do my
brows usually I'm only doing them if I'm
going to be taking photos for Instagram
or for being on YouTube because I know
that if I don't I will get the nasty
comments and so I think that my natural
brows are just fine I really do like
this bro is definitely much more sparse
than this proud there's like a whole
like chunk missing on my brow I don't do
a little where it went but this one is
definitely like more sparse and kind of
harder to control i guess but honestly I
think my natural brows are just fine and
it's a trend that I rock every single
day so you know kind of what I wanted to
do with this video is just bring a fun
and light-hearted video try out a new
trend I mean benefit is known for their
brows for their brow products for their
bro knowledge so when I saw him come out
with the brush up trend I was like hey
why not give it a try and then they had
tag on there and you know death of the
Instagram brow which I'm like please
like love can we have that happen can we
select people be natural and let them
live so I wanted to try it out I can't
say that I think it's going to be a
great one for me or one that I really
love but again it's because I like going
with my natural brows and I think it's
just sign but like I said I wanted to do
a little PSA in here and I don't want to
get too preachy because I've already
been mentioning it but you know whether
it has to do with eyebrows or just any
sort of look in general what it is that
you like for yourself it really is so
discouraging sometimes to see the
comments come in from other people but
my Instagram like started picking up
follower wise I actually got a lot of
comments from other beauty bloggers and
beauty creators about my eyebrows and
I'm not even kidding you guys it's so
ridiculous but I was getting messages
from people saying like if you want to
continue doing this and if you want to
have a successful Instagram or beauty
page you probably really should do your
eyebrows I mean I have saved all those
messages i could probably read them to
not like i would say names or anything
but i could read them word for word for
you what people were saying that people
are saying that i wouldn't be successful
because i didn't want to do my eyebrows
when you say that out loud i hope that
you guys are understanding how
ridiculous that sounds sincerely hope
that if someone is telling you that you
can't make it with what you want to do
or you can't be successful in an area
that you want to be successful in
because of what they think is right and
what they think it's normal and what
they think period i hope that you will
not listen to them because that's
ridiculous whatever it is that you want
to do whatever field you want to be in
whatever it is that you want to be when
you grow up you will always have those
nasty comments and those people that
want to put you down I just wanted to
come on and remind others and remind
myself that whatever it is that I'm
doing if I think it's right or I think
it's right for me or is what I'm
comfortable doing then that is right it
shouldn't matter what other people's
opinions are or what other people say
but I also wanted to give a reminder
that instead of leaving comments on
someone's pages or someone's photos
nitpicking something or saying you
should do it this way or you should
that way leave a compliment it is not
that hard you guys leave a compliment
leave something uplifting leave
something positive the times these
comments come in from people who don't
have beauty pages who have private
instagrams you know things like that
that they're not opening themselves up
to all the negative comments which can
be such a hard part of being on social
media because you are opening yourself
up to all this negativity that can come
into your life with that and maybe those
people don't have to deal with the
negative comments that come on to their
page because they get to choose who gets
to see their page and who gets to see
their pictures and they're not trying to
you know have a public profile and such
but it was really really discouraging
when the amount of beauty bloggers that
wrote in messages to me I mean a huge
thing that you see it so many people say
on their channels is makeup has no rules
makeup is for you what you're
comfortable in what you like to do yet
so many people seem to have this opinion
of we have to do things one way we have
to have our eyebrows looking this way we
have to have our winged liner this way
we have to have our lipstick this way
there are no rules when it comes to
makeup and you get to do what you want
to do and you get to do what you're
comfortable in a lot of times when I do
focus on my brows when I try to fill
them and just right and I try to line
them out just right and map them out and
put concealer on them I don't like the
way that I look and it makes me
uncomfortable and it makes me want to
like high like it it doesn't make me
comfortable in my own skin so I should
not have to do that you know be sure I
think you practicing I can keep having
fun with it I sure Ken maybe there will
be a day where I can be like desi
Perkins and have that beautiful
wonderful yet still somehow natural
looking brow after she fills it in maybe
there will be a time where I'm
comfortable having the filled in
eyebrows but you know right now it's
really not so I can take a few minutes
and run you know goof proof through my
eyebrows or a lot of days I just do that
gimme brow in my eyebrows so I can at
least say I have something on them but
you know I'm not going to worry about it
that much and I'm not going to let those
comments affect me so I wanted to make
this psi just for if you're someone who
deals with the negative comments you
know you do have to not listen to them
not focus on them and keep doing what
you want to do
what makes you comfortable and whether
you have a beauty page are not I just
really do encourage you guys don't leave
the negative comments don't tell someone
on their page that they should do
something this way or they should do
something that way or they should change
this about themselves that is not fun
that is not fair leave positivity
there's so so much bad in the world
there's so much negativity out there
that when it comes to makeup and beauty
and people just trying to have fun and
change up their looks and experiment and
do fun things we shouldn't have to deal
with all that negativity especially when
it comes to something as small as brows
so I just wanted to make this video I
hope that it was fun to see the brush
Dubrow friend let me know what you guys
think about it in the comments down
below but i also just wanted to talk a
little bit about the issues and the
comments and the negativity and
hopefully give a reminder to some of you
guys you know don't spread negativity
spread positivity and if you deal with
the bad comments then i feel you i
understand you and we just have to rise
above it and keep doing what we want to
do and work hard at what we want to work
hard at so i really hope that you guys
enjoyed this video i know it was a
little bit different for me but it was
one that I really did want to make and I
hope that you had fun watching it please
leave me some comments down below and
let me know what you thought about it
the trends the PSA all that good stuff
thank you guys so much for watching I
really do appreciate it I do have a big
giveaway going on right now i'll leave
