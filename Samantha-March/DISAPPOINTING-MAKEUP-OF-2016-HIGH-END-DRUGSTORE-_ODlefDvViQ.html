today's video is going to be a different
type of video for me I've never done one
like this but I actually had a couple
requests coming through and I thought
about it like I could do that so today's
video is going to be disappointing and
makeup products from 2016 so these are
going to be products that I tried out in
2016 or maybe even like super late 2015
there's some old ones in here but we're
gonna be makeup products that I tried
out last year that actually disappointed
me either I didn't like them I didn't
like formulas I don't like colors I
didn't like how they looked on me
there's gonna be a variety of different
reasons for why I found them
disappointing and you'll see as I go
through I'm not saying each product is
super bad or you shouldn't buy them you
know some of them are disappointing just
for you know personal reasons for myself
or even like pricing you know things
like that but I'm definitely not trying
to say that nobody should buy these
products or you shouldn't get them or
the companies are bad a lot of these
products I'm going to talk about I
actually love products from their brands
some of them are like my favorite brands
even so definitely not trying to say
anything super negative here but I find
these videos pretty interesting because
a lot of times we do pass over things
that we don't necessarily love and we
won't talk about it as much but those
are also really helpful to know and to
understand why because maybe something
didn't work for me but my con isn't a
huge con for you and it could still work
for you if that makes sense but yeah
because I saw a few requests come in for
this video I thought I could go ahead
and do it I have posted my best of 2016
video if you want to see that that will
be linked down below where I go over my
favorite products I also do have a best
of beauty giveaway going on where I
chose a 16 of my favorite products that
were featured in my best of beauty video
and I'm giving them away to you guys and
that one is ending in a couple weeks so
make sure that you get entered into that
giveaway but if you would like to see
some of my more disappointing products
from 2016 please keep watching so some
of these products I do have on hand some
I don't I've returned them or that word
of home or whatever but few things I can
have to show you other things I'll have
to insert pictures but one that was
really
pointing to me and it was disappointing
because it was super hyped up like this
was definitely a YouTube made me buy it
is the NYC liquid liner so many people
talked about it and when I first got on
YouTube everyone was like in all of its
of how to do a winged liner videos
everybody was using this eyeliner so I'm
like clearly I have to go good I have
found it at Walmart is you know super
inexpensive so I'm not bummed that I
didn't love it because of the price but
this is what the wand looks like and
it's just a very very like flimsy wand
which I don't think is great for making
a wing especially if you're just
learning because it's harder to have
control of it like when I take it to
flick it out I have no idea where it's
gonna go I mean it could go on my face
it could go to my next-door neighbor's
house I don't know where this eyeliner
is going and it just is not for me it
also transfers a lot I remember the
first time I used it I was trying so
hard and trying so hard and then I
lifted my head to look up and then just
boom eyeliner everywhere I'm like what
the heck I have kept it around I play
with it on days where I'm not doing like
a makeup look I'm not filming I'm not
doing anything like that I still play
with it and I'm trying to get a handle
on it because I've heard some other
people say like yeah it can be difficult
to use it definitely is but I was just a
disappointed in this one because so many
people hyped it up so many people said
you had to have it and I just found it
really hard to use but another product I
found pretty disappointing this one
because the like a launcher on it was so
hyped up and the product just did not
work for me at all I don't even have it
anymore
I might have actually just thrown it
away when I was doing a little bit of
cleaning up right before the holidays in
my office but it's the Too Faced better
than sex mascara the waterproof version
the regular version in the pink tube is
like one of my favorites I have a ton of
the better than sex mascara around my
house I got the waterproof one it was
actually in a like one of my
subscription boxes that it came in and I
was super excited to try it was just
like a deluxe sample size but it's so
excited to try it because I remember one
that's launched everybody was going
crazy about it the packaging was super
cool where it almost has like raised
water drops on the packaging and
and it was supposed to be like the best
waterproof mascara ever I didn't find it
to be waterproof at all in the slightest
there was nothing waterproof about in it
for me the amount of flaking I used it
in a makeup tutorial once it might have
been like my first impression makeup
tutorial I was using some new makeup and
I applied it and within probably two
minutes I zoomed in so you could see
that there was mascara flakes all over
my eyes and I was like I haven't even
put my lipstick on yet and my mascara is
already flaking off like that one just
did not work for me like I said I don't
even have it anymore I think I probably
threw it out but that was a definite
pass for me so the next one I want to
talk about is a liquid lipstick from
Kylie cosmetics and some of you who
might be a little confused if you watch
my best of beauty video because I
mentioned Kandy K from Kylie cosmetics
and I say it's one of my favorite liquid
lipsticks so the one that I want to talk
about is in exposed so this is from
Kylie cosmetics one of the matte liquid
lipsticks same as Kandy K and what I
found really interesting about this one
was that when Kylie first came out I
didn't place an order I thought it was
too expensive shipping was too expensive
I said I was gonna wait and see how the
reviews came in they came in really
positive and I was like okay so during
one of the other like launch times I
purchased the Kandy K lip kit I got the
lip liner and a liquid lipstick and I
loved it fell in love with it obviously
mine should my favorites video thought
it was great super long-lasting
comfortable no problem with it so then a
couple months go by and then she's
having a promo it was like a free
shipping promo so I decided to pick up
another liquid lipstick for me and then
a couple of other like giveaway prizes
and I decided to go with exposed because
it's a nude shade and I love nude the
problem with this one is that it's a
completely different formula than candy
cane I understand that companies changed
their formulas color pop is one that
like continually changes their formulas
Kylie cosmetics I know changed her
formulas quite a bit too so Kandy K was
one of the like initial shades that
Kylie put out exposed came afterwards so
when I purchase exposed I purchased it
because I loved candy K and I was
expecting to get the same formula or an
even
better one companies don't usually move
backwards with their formulas they move
forward so I purchased those thinking
I'm getting a bomb look with lipstick
and it really wasn't to me this where
time on this one is not good at all
definitely not the worst a liquid
lipstick that I've ever tried I'm not
trying to say that but what's
disappointing to me is that it's not
like Kandy K and I love that liquid
lipstick and now truly I haven't
purchased another liquid lipstick from
Kylie because I don't know a formula I'm
gonna get and that's the frustrating
part when companies change their
formulas so much like it seems like with
every launch you're getting something
different from Kylie and I'm like you
don't know what to expect and like I
said if it was only continually
improving as the launches went on then
great fine but this was after Kandy K
person way after Kandy K and I was just
disappointed that it wasn't the same
formula and that just seemed to be not
as good of a formula it was really
drying on the lips Kandy K to me is not
drying at all super drying on the lips
and then it wore off very very quickly
on the center of my lips Kandy K I can
wear for the entire night I wore it in a
wedding I did my makeup at 11 a.m. and I
touched up one time throughout the
entire night and was out till 1 a.m. so
this one just doesn't last like Kandy K
so that's why I'm disappointed I still
like it I like the color it's an okay
nude for me it's not my favorite nude
it's a good formula but it's not
fantastic and that is what has me
disappointed I think if I would have
bought this first from Kylie cosmetics I
would have been like oh great that's a
really good liquid lipstick but it
wouldn't have blown my socks off like a
candy k did so since I purchased it
after Kandy K that's why it's so
disappointing to me but let me know in
the comments down below what you think
about Kylie cosmetics and the different
formulas or even companies that
continually changed their formulas it
makes my job
honestly harder when I'm recommending
products to you because you just really
never know what you're gonna get so I
feel bad amending products that aren't
you know going to have like that
continuity throughout kind of makes me
feel bad but it was my thoughts on
exposed from Kylie cosmetics did have
some skincare that was disappointing to
me in 2016 it was from Juice Beauty I
was excited to try Juice Beauty because
I was hearing a lot of different
bloggers talk about it I've seen
the snapshots a lot of skincare routines
I was like okay I got righteous beauty I
tried out a set and I do I do have a
full snapchat or scratch it video on the
set that I purchased and it was hard for
me because there was a lot of items in
there like one of the moisturizers I
just didn't even use I tried it during
my testing period and then immediately
threw it away I was like nope I'm done
with that I think I featured it in my
most recent empties video I was really
disappointed there was a product in
there that had such a tiny tiny amount I
was really only able to use it three
times how do you even test something
with such a small amount of product I
don't know it also said there was like
some sort of like bonus gift inside the
kit there wasn't just overall it was
disappointing to me I did like a couple
of the products in there the peel
especially was a standout to me but also
the kit on a whole like I buy a lot of
skincare sets I bought a lot of sets in
general but I do buy a lot of skincare
sets and you usually can be able to use
them for a pretty good period of time
and get an idea if you really do love
them or not and these ones just each
product was so small like even the
cleanser which was the biggest item is
already empty for me I've already used
it up so that was just a little bit
disappointing and just for how much hype
i'd heard about them i don't know i
didn't i didn't see that it was worth
the hype for me but that was some
disappointing skincare for me in 2016
being a foundation that i really did not
get along with was the marc jacobs
remarkable foundation this was sent to
me in a social a box I partnered up with
social off for a video a couple months
back it's a subscription box but you
actually get to pick out exactly what it
is that you want you get to pick out I
think it's like five items and they send
you like small sample sizes of it so you
get to pick everything right down to
your shade I've picked to try the Marc
Jacobs remarkable foundation because a
lot of people have talked about this
foundation and said they really loved it
it looked horrible on me it was so thick
it was so full coverage that it actually
like hurt my face like my face felt
tight I was putting it on in the social
video and I remember just wanting to be
like I want to turn this off I look so
awful I tried it two more times just to
make sure I used a smaller amount of
product but it was just a total total
mess or me
it's a really high-end foundation that
gets a lot of like good feedback and bad
feedback - it's very mixed but for me
that was a definite no so the next one I
want to talk about is an eyeshadow this
single eyeshadow it's actually pink
champagne from Ozzie Beverly Hills I got
this I purchased this quad from Ulta you
could get for some black shadows and
then they sent you a BH little palette
as well I got it because I feel like
everybody was talking about pink
champagne there was so many tutorials
that were featuring pink champagne
it's being mentioned in favorites like
everyone just talked about pink
champagne from anasazi Beverly Hill it's
like to me it was right up there with
Birkin which I also purchased for this
little palette and I just really didn't
do much of anything for me it was super
light on my eyes I just I had to use you
know some sort of like mac fix+ and
really spray my brush and really dip it
in like seven times just to get the pink
to like kind of show up on my eyes I
don't know like I wondered for a while
if I got a dud because it just doesn't
really do much for me and that made me
pretty disappointed but yeah the pink
champagne from Anasazi Beverly Hills was
was not doing it for me then I have to
brow products to talk about oh where
else you guys follow my channel for a
while you know that I have like a
serious struggle with eyebrows but this
proves that like I've tried and I've
tried different products but one product
that really did not work for me was the
Browder and this is from pure cosmetics
and I love pure I use pure all the time
they're one of my favorite brands but
this one just really I just I don't know
I thought was really strange so it's
there perfecting brow powder so this is
what the applicator looks like and I
don't know if it was just between the
applicator which it is pretty stiff but
I don't know if this because of the
applicator because it's kind of like a
powder but then it like morphs into it
jail I don't know but I just couldn't
vibe with this thing I tried it several
times just to see if I could get it but
I couldn't I couldn't get it um I just
really didn't even understand the
product as a whole so that was a little
disappointing because I love pure and so
I thought I'd try something different
and maybe you'll really love it but
that one was a no-go and then another
one that I tried and just really didn't
love is the NYX micro brow pencil so a
lot of people like the Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow Wiz brow pencil I don't know
I'm a saucier one get the top I've never
used it obvious of it it gives a ton of
hype and people always say that this
next one is a dupe for it and it's you
know less expensive because it's from
the drugstore and so I thought okay I'll
give it a try it does have the spoolie
on one end and then it has a really
really like precise brow pencil on the
other and I don't know like first of all
the spoolie actually pulled my eyebrows
out which was crazy just like I remember
the first time using it being like am I
supposed to lose lose eyebrows when I
use an eyebrow ability like that's weird
and then I just couldn't get a lot of
product out of it like I would have to
press so hard and I dragged across my
eyebrows to get anything to happen and
it just it was not for me I tried I
tried this a lot I did not want to give
up on it I just kept thinking it was
probably user error because I'm not
really super eyebrow friendly so I was
like no it's got to be me and keep
trying it but definitely did not work
out the goof proof-- from benefit it's
definitely the way to go so these two
brow products were big disappointments
for me I had a couple products from
wet-and-wild that did not work out the
best for me so one was their glitters
and what's really interesting about this
they're just like single glitters
they're 99 cents at Target what's really
interesting to me is that one of them is
really good and one of them is really
bad but I seriously can't remember which
one like one when I used it and went on
so well I want to say it was like the
silver that it went on really well and
looked really nice so then I grew up
with gold and I actually was filming a
makeup tutorial I'm glad to scrap it
because this is so bad it was just like
oil like you were just putting oil on
your eyes and there was like a little
bit of shimmer to it it was really
bizarre I think it was the gold one but
it was weird because you know the exact
same product launched at the same time
bought it from the same store bought it
at the same time and they were just
totally completely different so that was
really really frustrating to me even
though they're only 19
Suns like I was excited because I
thought they'd be really good after I
tried the silver but I just hate that
inconsistency drives me crazy and then
another one from wet-and-wild that I
didn't love is their matte liquid
lipstick this was released with their
Fall collection and it's in the shade
don't be a plum plum and it ended up
just being super super patchy there's
what that one looks like it just ended
up being really patchy really streaky
and especially with such a dark color
all of that that's really gonna show and
it just did not look good I gave it a
couple tries trying to be fair and it
just was no good for me I did recently
just talk about the liquid cat suit
lipsticks from wet and wild and I didn't
love them but they're good like they're
good for a drugstore liquid lipstick for
five dollars like they're good this one
to me like isn't isn't wearable I just
need to get rid of it so yeah that was a
big disappointment for me I love wet in
wild I like so many other products but
these these guys were were no good for
me
the last two that I have to talk about
our products that recently launched and
I did videos lots of videos on them on
my channel and they were really cute
massive disappointment failures to me so
one is from a Smashbox it was one of
their new cover shot eyes shadow
palettes I got mine in soft light so
first of all the biggest disappointment
with that one was that I thought I
ordered a different one from Sephora
when they launched I was sent off light
I really didn't have a lot of interest
in soft light but before I was able to
make the decision to exchange it for
what I actually want it they of course
were sold out because everything sells
out in five minutes and then you can't
get it again so the palettes did come
back in stock later but it was already
you know I was like I buy things super
early like that and get them shipped to
me super fast so I can make the videos
on them that's why I didn't exchange
them even when they friend they did come
back because I just had to bust and do
it and use it and make my videos I'll
leave them linked down below if what I
thought up the soft light palette but
not only was I disappointed on you know
obviously I wasn't the wrong palette but
I just I didn't love it at all they were
way too soft just way too not my you
know type of style but what really like
disappointed me the most I truly think
about it was that
we were really given like no information
this launch like kind of came out of
nowhere
we'd had very little time very little to
go by they released seven of these mini
action out of house at the same time and
then when they released even a day
earlier on the sephora website which
nobody was expecting either you had to
make the decision and make it fast
because they were gonna sell out because
again all makeup sells out so freaking
fast these days so it was kind of like a
mad scramble and you know that was
really like just the launch was weird to
me we didn't get a lot of information we
didn't get a lot of swatches we just had
to pick from seven eyeshadow palettes
it's you know it's not like they're just
really saying one eyeshadow palette and
being like here you go you know get it
if you want it you're trying to decide
and they're $29 a piece so you don't
want to start you know getting two would
three and four because then you're
spending a lot of money on little
eyeshadow palettes so that one that was
what was really disappointing to me
didn't I just didn't like the way that
the launch went and then getting the
wrong palette just disgruntled me even
further and then I didn't like it at all
so then that truly made me very angry so
I ended up returning it to Sephora so
the Smashbox cover shot palettes did not
work for me and then the other one that
didn't you guys are probably not
surprised at all we could probably just
all say it together was the Too Faced
white chocolate chip palette oh my word
I was so disappointed in that palette
there was of course a lot of hype around
about the white chocolate chip palette
and the chocolate chip palette they've
released at the same time again they
were mini palettes and I decided to
purchase mine because I don't have any
of the chocolate bar palette from Too
Faced so I thought it would be a good
way to get in because they're supposed
to be like like minier versions of some
of the chocolate bar palettes so I
thought it would be a good way I have a
mini eyeshadow palette they have a
little bit of money still get in on it
and no it was so bad you guys again I'll
leave my videos I'll link down below but
I was super disappointed in that and I
remember I actually took about the Too
Faced palette and the Smashbox palette
at the same time I took it back to the
Sephora and got up to the dusk and the I
set him down not in a bag or anything
just had him in my purse I set him down
and the woman like not even I mean
probably she saw me that I wasn't
walking around the store but she just
immediately goes returning them
and I said yes and she didn't even ask
me why reasonings anything like that
like usually they'll ask me some sort of
questions did not work out for you you
didn't like the color was something
wrong with it and she just like gave a
little laugh and asked for my email
address and off we went and I was like I
think she knows I think she knows that
between these two pallets that a lot of
returns are coming in I didn't see very
much positive feedback on the toothpaste
pallets both of them and the white
chocolate chip and the chocolate chip
palette so super super disappointed in
them that was that might have been like
my most disappointing project of the
year quite honestly if I had to pick one
really bummed about that and honestly
it's kind of like made me weird about to
face in general I did a will I buy it on
the two-faced peach collection I
recently talked about the collab that
they were coming out with Kat Von D and
I'm like you know what I'm gonna need a
little bit more time to get over the
white chocolate chip fella like I'm
gonna need a little bit of time so yeah
but that is gonna be the last item that
I'm talking about for my disappointing
products about 2016 alright guys that is
gonna wrap it up for my disappointing
products of 2016 I hope that you guys
enjoyed this video or found it helpful
in some way again I hope that you guys
know that I'm not trying to like bash on
any of these products or companies or
anything like that but this video had
been requested and I thought it would be
an interesting one to do I do my will I
buy up videos where I talk about
products and you know if I'll buy them
and go into depth in there but I don't
try to be a negative Channel I don't
have like the clickbait titles and and
covers just to bring you guys in to bash
about other people and gossip and you
know do that kind of thing that's not
what I want my channel to be but I do
like to do reviews and product reviews
and a lot of times if I don't like
products I do just kind of gloss over
them skip over them sometimes I'll talk
about on my snapchat and things like
that but a lot of times I just kind of
like pass over them and pretend like it
never happened sometimes not often but
sometimes I'll do that but one this type
of video I had been requested I thought
you know what I'll go ahead and do it
and you know try to give a fair and
honest review on each of the products
that I'm talking about and again they
were disappointments for me in different
aspects and hopefully I explained them
good enough but I
something you guys enjoyed this video
thank you for requesting them I really
appreciate when you guys request videos
I don't think this would have been a
video that I would have thought of by
myself like I've seen other people doing
them but I never had it in my mind that
oh I should do that video so I
appreciate it please do keep the
requests coming in because they really
do help me out so much but that's gonna
be it for this video please do give it a
thumbs up if you did enjoy it make sure
you are subscribe before you go and I'll
catch you real soon in my next one bye
