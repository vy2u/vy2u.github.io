am a super excited for today's video
because it's going to be all about my
new ring light I finally finally got a
ring light and I'm going to be telling
you guys about it how I set it up and
then also giving you a very brief tour
of my office where you see me film all
of my videos and then talking a little
bit about like how I record what camera
I use what editing I use so kind of just
going through my filming setup and what
I use to make and create in YouTube
videos I know I get asked a ton of
questions all the time about the cameras
I use the lights I use an editing
program that I use so I thought I could
address it in this video video is
actually sponsored by Ziva ring light
and they did it send me my ring light
and if you guys have been following me
for a while you probably understand how
appreciative I am to be making this
video and to have a ring light I have
wanted good quality lighting for so long
and I talked about there's a lot about
how I have always been very locked into
a certain time of hours three times a
day that I can film my videos because I
was only filming off natural light so to
be able to have a ring light has just
opened up so many more possibilities for
me it has made my video content quality
so much higher and I'm just so super
thankful so I want to focus this video
on my ring light of course but show you
how it looks when I set it up though you
the differences between having my ring
light and then not having my ring light
so you can kind of see that but also I
thought it would be fun to pop in this
video a little bit about the space that
I film in and how I actually film so
that's what we'll be doing in today's
video and a huge huge thank you to do
the ring light for sponsoring this video
design so so thankful so all of the
links will be down below for the deeper
ring light and everything that I chat
about all of that will be down in the
description box but why don't we go
ahead and get started first when I got
my ring light it comes in this ginormous
box I mean the box is absolutely huge so
it's kind of a glimpse of what the box
looks like and then I do have my ring
light right here so right now I'm
filming
natural light because I wanted to show
you to bring light but I will also close
my blinds as you can see what it would
look like without the ring light in non
natural daylight hours and then what it
would look like with the ring light semi
ring light right here on the stand I do
have the diffuser on it I will jump to
the other side of the cameras release
you can actually see the entire setup
but for the actual vivo ring light Nova
it is 199 dollars again the website will
be linked down below and they do ship
internationally which i think is great
and then the other accessories are not
included with the light but you can
purchase them separately so whatever it
is that you would need you can purchase
them separately to have the diffuser
cloths on it like I said which is 29.95
it just depends on how I am filming if
I'm going to use it if I'm filming in
like absolute darkness like I'm filming
at you know eight o'clock at night and I
have absolutely no light coming in I
will take the cloth off because I feel
like it makes my videos brighter and I
need like all the lighting help that I
can get it when I'm filming in the
pitch-black but if I'm filming you know
when maybe the Sun is going down or we
just it's a cloudy day but we still have
some light I'll put the diffuser cloth
on it so it's not quite as bright and
just kind of almost as a little bit more
warmth to the video my husband did put
it together for me because this is not
to where my skills are and I think it
took him less than 10 minutes
it did have you know directions in there
as well but it was very very easy to set
up easy to put the cloth on and it just
has a little switch on the back and it
immediately worked so there was no like
difficulty setting it up or anything
like that and I've just been so
impressed with the first time I turned
it on after we set it up I mean it lit
up my whole office and I was like okay
this is going to be amazing
because I actually have two soft boxes
that I bought instead I bought them off
Amazon when I knew I needed to get some
sort of lighting going on for my video I
decided to purchase them because they
were cheaper than the ring light and now
that I have the ring lights it just
would have made better sense to
just purchased the ring light because
with the softboxes I would have to have
both of them set up and they are pretty
baked I don't have a huge office
especially for things like storage so
it's hard for me to have these two
really big soft boxes in my office
because you couldn't just use one of
them when filming at night I had to use
both and they both had to be on me and
then I didn't have anything in the back
what I've learned that from looking at
different still make setups is that you
really need some sort of light in the
back or else your back is just like all
shadows and your face can look really
shadowy as well so I didn't have that
option now that I have the ring light I
can put that in front of me and that's
all I need and I put one of my soft
boxes in the back and it just has really
I think improved my quality on my
lighting in my videos so I know the
diverting light is a more expensive and
that's what always kind of scare me
about purchasing it and then I just
thought well what if I can't get it
anyways you know I'm such a beginner
still even though I've had my channel
for over a year I'm like I'm still such
a beginner with this and I'm not a great
lighting and tech person what if I can't
figure it out and then I've just wasted
$200 but after getting it after seeing
how easy the setup was and easy just
positioning it and working with the ring
light it just really didn't press me and
made me wish that I would have just gone
that route anyways because it would have
saved me a lot of like time and
frustration hey you want some you lose
some you learn and then I can pass these
lessons along to you guys as well in
case you are interested in getting a
summit lighting also but that's just a
little bit about the diva ring light and
how I came again everything's linked
down below but I also want to flip
around so I can show you how I have it
set up and then also show you how I have
my filming set up when I actually film
because I thought that might be a little
bit interesting it to see so I wanted to
go ahead and jump into that part okay so
this is what my ring light looks
assembled so I believe they're just an
18 inch light again I have the diffuser
cloth on it right now but you can see
underneath what the light looks like and
then this here in the back is where the
switch is to turn it on and off and I
have it on the regular stand right now
instead of the hardware mouse
for my camera one thing that I really
like about it too is that the cord is
extremely along on my softboxes the
cords are not very long so that I'm even
more limited as to where I can put them
but with this the cord is nice and long
this is what my diva ring light looks
when it is all set up okay so this is
what my videos look like when I am just
using my ring light I don't even have my
softbox
set up behind me because it looks like
or whatever light you can see everything
is really thread you can see me clearly
and it looks great and then I'll show
you what it looks like without the ring
light so this is new without the ring
light and I just have a one light in my
office it's on above me
obviously you pretty much cannot see me
so definitely three light is a very much
needed and very much useful when making
my videos I have popped the light back
on but that is what it looks like when
it is a dark outside and clearly I just
can't film without a ring light in those
conditions and like I said I was able to
film before only in natural light which
was only a couple hours a day obviously
you could see a huge difference in how
much the ring light does come in handy
and I will also insert some photos in
here as well what I look like without
the ring light and then what I look like
with the ring light so you can see the
difference in my still shots as well
which you know I post all those on
Instagram but basically the ring light
has just been a huge lifesaver to me I'm
so appreciative I'm so grateful to have
one I've been saving up for a ring light
for so long but they are more expensive
and I just was scared I was scared I
wasn't gonna be able to figure it out
I'm scared it was just going to be too
complicated and too much for me but once
I got it and I saw how easy it was kind
of made me feel a little bit silly that
I've been holding out but you know I do
also always see what time giveaways on
my channel purchase a nice camera
because previously before I got my
camera I was filming off of my phone so
I bought a camera first and then I was
going to slowly try to start working on
the lights but between giveaways and
just trying to purchase new makeup items
to review made it a little bit
challenging to keep saving up so I'm
just super super grateful to be verbing
light so for sending me the ring lights
so sponsoring this video I'm just
insanely insanely grateful for this
opportunity so that's kind of my
thoughts and feedback on the ring light
and a little bit of a demo as well and I
wanted to get into like my actual
filming a set up so you can see where I
film and also how I film so let's hop
into that part next so I do have doors
that lead into my office and then once
you come in this is where film every day
so this is my office this is where I
work every day this is where I film this
is where I store everything like this is
this is my place this is my home so kind
of the main focus of my office is of
course my desk because it is ginormous
and I was just really proud the day that
I got this desk because I just love it
so much those like all of my eyeshadow
pellets it's a disaster I'm not getting
too deep into what my room looks like
because I'm in the middle of like
reorganizing and just trying to get my
edge together because it's really badly
needed this section is usually makeup
that I'm wearing that day tumbler with
my name on it my Kindle perfume that I
love my lip scrub from fresh that I love
so much my calendar another calendar
because I love calendars this is
actually my bridal bouquet I had fake
flowers so I keep them off for decor
just some random pictures some skincare
up here this is my bookshelf I have a
lot of skincare up top here and then my
brush collection which is like
completely out of hand I also have some
more makeup on here this is like a
little lipstick holder here and I have
this tourney vanity and then on this
shelf I have a bunch of my makeup miss
this is full of nail polish that's full
nail polish as well and then this bottom
shelf is just completely crammed what
books I also have some floating shelves
on the wall over here at that holds of
books over here I have my printer and
then some acrylic shelves that hold our
acrylic drawers that hold makeup as well
this is like my favorite drawers full of
lashes but again I just need like
our organization and then this bottom
drawer is where I have like a bunch of
my makeup bags then this desk is kind of
what's always behind me so I received
one of these fitting vanities from an
online store from Amazon that I'll leave
a link down below and then my mom got me
the other one
it's QVC this was also sent to me from
the same store that sent me this
spinning Tower
a lot of times in here I have new makeup
our products to review our products that
I need to remember to review and you
know keep trying out needs to be
organized because as it lasts I have a
girl blast mug here that holds more
makeup in it out sent to me from an
author friend this drawer needs a ton of
help I can barely ever open it like this
is a big reason why I'm working on
organization it's just neat it's so bad
this drawer I can barely open them it's
filled with giveaway items I did get
these shells from an Amazon company
called pre display if you follow me on
snapchat you know I should have cooked
them on this wall
and so I put them on this wall and I
just like looked too cluttered in my
YouTube videos because it's behind me so
instead of filling these with makeup
which looked really cool
instead put a magazine article that I
was featured in it wasn't puff and then
also my fifth book so that's kind of
easy in the background now but they want
to eventually put them over here but
they're like anchored into the wall so
it was like rip up my wall so that's
that's going to be for another day a lot
of people always asked what's on my wall
it says quiet please novel in progress
if you don't know I'm an author and this
is pretty much always the case for my
office but that's just a quick overview
of what my office looks like what my
filming space Oh looks like as you can
see I have the diva ring light set up
here and then my tripod goes in front of
it my mom kept this for me off of Amazon
so that's where my tripod goes and then
I sit here on a high top stool that we
have for our kitchen a lot of people
have asked me if I sit or stand in my
videos I sit but I sit on a high top and
then behind me is
the desk our review of my filming space
I'm hoping to I'll get more organized
here shortly
maybe film a video as I organize or I'll
at least do an aster so you can see what
it looks like after I kind of switch
around my organization but then for the
final for the video I just wanted to
touch on what I use to film so you kind
of saw my selling set up like I said
sometimes if I am filming in like
complete darkness I'll put a softbox
behind me low to the ground and flip it
up so I have some backlight coming in
but a lot of times it's just my tripod
from Amazon my ring light from diva ring
light my camera which is a sony a 5100 I
get asked a lot of questions on what
camera I used to film it's the sony a
5100 when I was researching what cameras
to get this is kind of like the one that
everyone seems to start with I do find
it very beginner friendly and I really
appreciate that I'm not going to really
go through all my settings like some
people do because mine are basically on
the default settings I'm not a tech
person I'm not grated that kind of stuff
and I feel like the default settings
those on is pretty darn good
so I'm very happy about that but I don't
really know anything about f-stop and
white balance and I try and I try to
learn and pick up little things here and
there but I'm not a professional on it
so I really like to so many a 5100 it
does have the flip screen so I can look
at the viewfinder on the top which I'm
really happy about I also really like it
because it has a wireless feature on it
so when I take photos on this camera and
a wirelessly send them to my phone which
I think is amazing there's just an app
that you put on your phone and then you
can wirelessly transfer them over which
i think is awesome just starting out the
sony a 5100 is relatively inexpensive
compared to other cameras out there I
think I paid four to five hundred
dollars for mine I know I get asked
sometimes if I use a filter on my videos
and I don't I don't even I don't even
know how to do that I don't know how
people put filters on my video but it
seems like very very recently like in
the past couple weeks I've been asked
about why I use filters and I need to
stop using filters and I don't and I had
a conversation with this on my
chat and I know there's been some talk
about beauty bloggers using filters in
their videos and how you know it doesn't
make us truthful and whatnot and it was
like after these videos from like Wayne
Goss and I know someone else did a video
about it that's when the comments
started coming in so I like I've had
this camera for a year and I've never
once been asked that question until
after these videos came out but I
thought I would address it too because
when talking with my snapchat I got told
a lot that other people say that so many
a 5100 almost has like a built in I
don't even know what you would call it
has something built into it where it can
like soften your skin or whatever I
really don't know but apparently as a
part of the sony a 5100 and some people
have complained about it because it's
not something that can be turned off
it's just a seizure what the camera when
people are saying I was using it filter
I'm like you can see like redness and
blemishes on my face like if I'm using a
filter shouldn't those not be there that
just makes more sense to me there is
also a blurring background you can see
like my background is a little bit
blurred I know a lot of people really
like that and I use a sigma lens for it
but this one I really don't know how
it's doing it I don't know if someone I
thought someone said something about
like the f-stop maybe makes the
background blurry but again I have no
idea and I'm not connected appear on my
to you and act like I know that because
they don't but the background is blurry
so I don't know I was like maybe
sometimes I'm like too close to my
background and it blurs me out too but
I've never thought I have looked blurry
in any of my videos so again I don't
know but I thought it would address it
here since I'm talking about it but that
might be a feature with the Saudi a 5100
and if you're not going to like that
then you probably wouldn't like it this
camera another downfall to this camera
is that it overheats very quickly at
once is it about the 28th 50 100 but it
does I feel difficulty only some for up
to 13 minutes of time and then I have to
take a look another 10 minutes and let
it cool down completely and then I can
film again
so it has a simmer for a year and its
really done a fantastic job has been
very happy with it overall but there are
those little cons to it that I hope to
be able to upgrade cameras one day in
the near future but I didn't want to
share some of the pros and cons I'll
have it linked down below as well along
with you know my tripod and things like
that and then the editing programs that
I use I get asked a lot about - is
wondershare filmora
no Final Cut Pro is a very very popular
editing program again I'm very new I'm
not a very big tech person so final
Final Cut Pro when I was looking into it
it was like not very beginner friendly
or even really user friendly until
you've really gotten it down so I
decided to go with wondershare filmora
because it's a lot more inexpensive I
can't remember the annual fee right now
but I believe it's just once a year you
get charged a fee and I think it's a
really good editing program I thought it
was really easy to use I'll have one to
share it linked down below but I also do
have a video that I found a while back
about just starting a YouTube channel
and how to sort of YouTube channel with
no money I often refer back to that
video when people ask me questions about
starting a channel because that's how I
started a channel you'll see me filming
on my phone you'll see how I used to
edit my videos using a free tool on
YouTube you'll see how I used to take
one of the bar stools like I sit on
stack it up with books and then have a
piece of wood that would hold my phone
before I got a tripod how's that video
link down below in case you guys want to
see it but if you want to see another
video like that or how to sort of
channel tips for starting a channel
anything like that let me know the
comments down below
but other than that I think was
everything that I wanted to touch on it
for this video so I really hope that you
enjoyed it seeing about my new ring
light and seeing how well it works and
kind of my review on it and then also
like my filming setup and where I film
and all of that I just hope you found
this video helpful and I just thought it
would be really fun to kind of
incorporate these other details into
this video talking about the ring light
because it all kind of works together if
that makes sense but I do I highly
recommend the ring light I mean this is
something that I pretty much figured I
would love and get along with but now
that I actually got it the only thing
I'm frustrated with is that I didn't get
it sooner that I just kept prolonging it
I just thought I wouldn't be able to get
it and you can if I can get it you guys
can get it I've just been so happy with
it and it's just I know it's already
improved my quality because I've gotten
a lot of comments recently about how
good my lighting look and that makes me
so happy but it also will just let me
film whenever I want to I don't need to
be stuck only being able to film during
daylight hours which is going to be so
so helpful to me so another huge thank
you to diva room light for sending this
to me and for sponsoring
video I'm so completely grateful and
thankful for it I hope it helps you guys
out if you wanted some tips and tricks
on filming set up lighting anything like
that I hope this video did help you out
make sure to leave me some comments down
below let me know if it did because I
would love to know your feedback I'd
love to know what lighting you use do
you guys have a ring light what camera
do you use
I love to know because I find these
videos really interesting myself and I
watch them all the time because it's
always nice I feel like I'm always
picking out the tip or trick or two when
I watch these kind of videos so I hope
that this one it did it for you too and
it's going to do it for this video again
I hope you guys on it helpful or
enjoyable and if you did please make
sure to give it a thumbs up don't forget
to subscribe before you go and I'll
catch you guys real soon in my next one
