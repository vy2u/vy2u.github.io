today's video is going to all about some
drugstore makeup products that I feel
are priced too high I saw Lauren my
beauty do this one recently I think she
called her video like drugstore prices
that need to check themselves or
something like that and I thought the
video was really fun so I will have hers
link down below but as I was watching
her video there were so many items that
were ringing in my head like oh I
remember thinking that about this look I
remember thinking that about this line
and I thought it would be a fun video to
do so I have 10 products here from the
drugstore that I think are priced too
high that are overpriced the prices
caught me off-guard with these guys one
thing that I do want to mention before
we get started is that I do live in the
United States of America so I am going
to be going off of our pricing what is
regular for us what is normal to us at
the drugstore I fully understand that it
could be different based on the country
that you live in just as the currency
exchange could be different the housing
market the job market or healthcare
system it could be different than what
we have in the u.s. so I did want to
point that out I am in the US and that
is what I am basing this video off of so
please do keep that in mind if you live
in another country and this video style
format will bother you because of your
different prices in your different
countries I post a video every single
day and maybe you enjoy tomorrow's video
or check back on yesterday's video I
still thought this video could be fun to
do because especially more and more
lately we've been seeing drugstore
prices and some drugstore Briones start
inching up inching up inching up and
some of the prices have definitely
really caught me off guard as of lately
so like I said I do have 10 different
products that I want to chat about so
why don't we go ahead and get started so
the first fact that I want to talk about
is the one that when I was watching
Lauren's video this is the one that I
commented with on her video if that
makes sense because as I was watching it
this was the very first one that popped
into my mind and I feel like this maybe
was one of the first types that it was
like whoa I didn't know drugstore prices
got this high I went to my CVS it was
over the summertime I went to my CVS
lungs because I was starting to hear a
foundation being really talked about on
YouTube and I thought I want to give
that a try I went to CVS I found the
foundation I found my shade I grabbed it
I was like sweet
and then I glanced at the price and it
was $17 for a drugstore foundation and I
said no but I put it right back I am
talking about the Neutrogena hydraboost
foundation or as I was looking at for
this video the proper name for it
apparently is the Neutrogena hydraboost
tint because it's supposed to be a very
light coverage foundation and when I was
hearing people talk about it a lot of
people compared it to like a BB cream or
something like that and I was doing this
in the summer where I typically wear the
lighter coverage I don't do it on a full
coverage in the summer I do BB creams I
did powder foundations something just a
little bit lighter on my skin so that's
what I was thinking like oh this could
work out really well for me but then
when I saw it was $17 I didn't even have
that thing in my hand for a minute
before I put that back I was like a
doing because I think to my Clinique
could be on perfecting foundation
concealer that was $28 for me so I'm
like to spend $10 more and get a really
full coverage long lasting foundation
that I love I was like ma'am Neutrogena
that is really expensive one other thing
that I wanted to say about drugstore
makeup is that it's sometimes it can be
hard talking about prices with drugstore
because prices can vary from CVS to
Walgreens to Walmart to Ulta to the
brands website you know things like that
some retailers you can use coupons on
some you can't and all of that I'm just
going to be going off of the retail
value price that I saw so I did want to
make sure to point that out because with
the Neutrogena one
it was 1699 on someone on some websites
and then on the Neutrogena website it
said of us for sale for $14.99 so hey
there but I'm just going off retail
price I'm saying with Lauren dead in her
video next up of course I was going too
much in this one of course I was these
are the NYX in your element palettes I
purchased one myself I purchased the
fire palette and I was immensely
disappointed in this these pellets came
out I can't even think how many months
back it was I'll insert a photo of the
fire pellet here but I was really
excited when NYX was going to drop these
an asset they were like showing them and
hide
them up I was like yes I want one of
these collards
I picked out the fire pellet cuz yellow
in the red I was super excited for it I
had already made up my mind that I was
gonna purchase it and in my mind I might
get snicks it's affordable this is gonna
be great and then they drop the prices
and they were $30 for a drugstore
eyeshadow palette and I thought how did
this happen
and the reason why I still purchased it
and I pretty much talked myself into it
anyways but I was like you know what if
NYX is charging $30 for an eyeshadow
palette
they must firmly believe in that
eyeshadow palette they must think this
palette is the freakin bomb I know that
there was a bunch of influencers that
worked with NYX on there in your element
pellets and I have to say though I was I
was super disappointed in that palette I
ended up returning mine because it was
not worth $30 not even that it was Nixon
us we're not worth $30 it wasn't worth
$30 even if it would have come from a
higher-end brand and it's crazy to me
that NYX Church $30 for that eyeshadow
palette and then huda beauty recently
released her smaller pellets the
obsession pellet I now have two of them
and those are $27 and I really enjoyed
the quality of those and I was so
unimpressed with the NYX one I used it
in a first impression video people saw
me struggling to make that palette work
I was really disappointed they're not
even available on the Ulta website
anymore I don't know what happened there
I don't know if you can still find him
in stores but they're not available on
the Ulta website but I did see on thanks
website that they've now been reduced to
$15 and I'm like yeah they should be $15
what why are you charging us 30 that is
crazy
but another drugstore brand that
recently hit us up with the $30
eyeshadow palette is Maybelline when
Maybelline came out with their
collaboration with model Gigi Hadid
those were some inflated prices and I
like I had learned my lesson by that
time I was like I have not even you are
not getting me on this one Maybelline
watching some people who got the
products in PR are some people who
bought them anyways and from what I
heard on a whole of course there are
some people who love certain things and
vice versa but as a whole it seemed like
it wasn't worth the $30 and I just
thought that was crazy for me
willing to come out with a price that
high as well and that one you know you
kind of felt like you were paying for
gigi hadid sneem which I don't know I
just thought that was kind of crummy
yeah you said beer collaborating with a
brand that's known for being affordable
why can't you sell Cuba prices
affordable I don't know that would that
would bothered me I did not get suckered
into that one though Maybelline did not
get my $30 on that one but next up is a
primer that I have wanted for a very
long time
I feel like this primer was always
really hyped about on YouTube especially
when I first started watching it and
everybody was saying like this is a
really good primer from an affordable
brand it was like yeah but why is there
not more affordable I'm talking about
the NYX angel lil primer so I found it
for the retail price of about 16 dollars
and this is one where like I would see
it at my target and I'd be like I really
want to get that people say good things
about I still hear people say good
things about it and using it but it was
16 dollars for her primer and I'm like I
just don't know if I can do that I
wanted to include it on my list because
it's always been one of those that have
been on like my makeup wishlist I've
just never given into it and also though
I will say a couple of years back when I
was four starting YouTube and getting
into it I was someone who didn't believe
in primers maybe now I would consider it
more but honestly still I have some
really good drugstore primers that are
less than that the flower Beauty new
primers that they came out with I'm very
much impressed with and those are either
12 or 13 dollars so I don't know the NYX
angel availed me and that was I can
remember one day at Target I had it I
had it in my little hand for a while and
then and then I got more makeup to my
cart and I was like you know well that
you can't spend that much money and the
angel Bell primer went back who was
tried it do you think it's worth the
price tag did you get it on to let us
know some on my list is blind at that I
just kind of have a funny story about us
all because I went back and forth on if
I should include this but I like telling
stories I'm an author right this is what
I do for a living I enjoy telling
stories so I'm gonna tell this story but
this one is the Physicians Formula
bronze booster and I've owned it for
$14.99 this is one that I actually still
have and
you own that this might be the first
physician's formula product that I
bought it's either this or the butter
bronzer and I can't really remember but
for some reason I want to say that this
came first and people were talking about
this physician's formula was a new brand
to me and I was like I really want to
try it but I remember going to my CVS
and seeing the 1415 dollar price tag and
being like is that too much money to
spend on a face palette so identify it
identify identify two different shades
of this one and mine I got in the back
sculpting because it has a setting
powder a contour and bronzer which I've
been into face palettes for a very long
time because this was quite some time
ago I finally ended up buying it when
Physicians Formula went by I wouldn't
get one half off I think it was about
one for myself and I bought one to put
into a giveaway that is when I finally
broke down and decided to buy it because
I just could not pay full price for it
you guys know I'm a deal chaser I could
not pay full price for this but why I
wanted to still include it in this video
is because when I was looking for the
price of it and I saw the 14.99 my first
thought was oh that's not that much
money and I just thought it was
interesting how the mindset can change
over you know I'm gonna say a year a
year and a half a year and a half ago
when I went to buy this I refused
refused to pay full price for it because
I thought it was too expensive for
drugstore but it's almost like as you
get used to the drugstore prices
climbing and you get use of these higher
price tags all of a sudden what you
thought was pricey before is also not so
pricey so I just thought that was
interesting and I thought that I would
include it in here and that's another
thing too you know when you think about
how prices differ from country to
country you you really do have to keep
in mind that it's kind of unfair to
judge especially the person who's just
talking about the prices we don't make
the prices that's just what we pay for
them so it's really hard to say well my
prices are higher over here it's like
yes I agree with that but there's all
these other different factors that you
also have to include in and you just
kind of have to go off of what you are
used to so I thought this was
interesting that I used to think it was
prized super super high and now my creme
not as bad as I once thought it was that
was intriguing to me as I want it to
include it in here but yeah I can
remember wanting this so badly but I
wait
hell though I held up for that deal but
next time I have an item here from pixie
beauty now pink sea beauty is one of
those brands that I kind of feel like
has always been a little bit higher
price than some of the other drugstore
brands but when I was looking through
what I could mention because honestly
there I felt like there was quite a few
items from pixie that I could MAGIX like
I said that's kind of what I feel about
their brand overall but I found a
contour powder from them a single
contour powder for 20 dollars and I was
like wow that's pretty expensive for one
contour powder because anastacio just
released bronzers single bronzers and
those are $28 so like you spent $8 more
and get a Nastasia and the balm it just
came out with the new powders as well
and I use the shades as both contour and
bronzer shades and I think those are
14:50 from the balm
so even cheaper than pixie Beauty I
thought that was pretty well but has
anybody tried these pixie contour
powders I have not myself and honestly I
don't think I would I don't I don't
think I would pay the $20 for it that
just seems pretty darn pricey another
product that I want to talk about is a
newer release and these are from Milani
and these are their new eyeshadow
palettes that they came out with they
have I think it's called the bold
obsessions eyeshadow palette and then
they have a matte one as well and these
are retailing for $20 I did mention them
in a will in my video and I said I was
interested in them I'm just kind of
unsure about the price point cuz I don't
$20 for a drugstore eyeshadow palette
does just seem high to me but it's crazy
because as we were being introduced to
the $30 eyeshadow palette then sometimes
I have this this inkling of like maybe
$20 isn't that bad and I'm like dang it
what happened to like the $10 eyeshadow
palettes are like the one Wow palettes
that are like five or six dollars what
happened to that but I will say that
these Milani palettes do seem to be
getting good feedback and reviews people
seem pretty excited about them and I
know when I mentioned it in a past video
some people are also saying that you can
find them at Walmart for more of like
the $15 price range which I definitely
think is better but the retail price on
them is $20 and I did took the Milani
website and they are listed at $20 at
Milani at the time that I was putting
this list together but I thought that
was kind of high but who hasn't do you
like do you think they're worth the 20
let me know if you want to see a video
on drug surprises that are higher but I
think are worth the price I could
totally do a video like that as well
another product that I wanted to mention
is a brush set from elf cosmetics and
this is called their beautifully a
precise brush set I think I'm saying
that correctly I'll have everything
listed down below of course so this guy
is $65 for 6 brushes from elf elf is one
of those brands that I feel like
normally keep their prices pretty darn
low and as we've been seeing drugstore
prices climb there's a few of those
brands that are that are staying strong
in their drugstore zone but when I saw
$65 for 6 brushes from elf I was like hi
my like some of my first makeup brushes
when I was starting to build my
collection came from elf because they
were the $1 and $2 brushes that I could
get at Target that I could get at my
local grocery store and the beauty
section they have Elfa they have their
one down there brushes in there like
some of my very first brushes were the 1
to $2 brushes and all of a sudden I've
seen $65 for 6 brushes I was like hey I
saw this set come out and I actually do
have one of the brushes it's I use it
for contour used it for contour today
and I really do enjoy that brush and I
think I've even mentioned it in a
favorites video because I really do like
that brush for contour and so when I saw
this set finally come out at all theis I
put out a tweet about it I like to try
to tweet about like new makeup releases
and things like that over on my Twitter
account so I put a tweet out saying you
know this new scent is available and
people were like why is it $65 so for
ELF brushes and I was like I don't know
I'm just telling you what's available
I'm just telling you what's new and
what's out there I did not make those
prices because I can't pay $65 for 6
brushes for mouth I would not be able to
even though I have one of the brushes
and I think it's really good that's
still crazy to me it's crazy
ok moving on moving um this one I
actually do hold this product actually
excuse me let me head back to my messy
desk here but this next product is one
that I do have and I would like to share
another story sorry for people that
don't like start his me probably don't
like my channel very much but I started
hearing people talk about Burt's Bees
quite a bit
I thought kathleenlights mentioned a
blush and I think it was her best at
Beauty 2017 video or at least a
favorites video and I've been seeing
these blushes being mentioned quite a
bit lately so when I was at my CVS I saw
the Burt's Bees section and I saw this
blush and I thought
Kathleen likes this blush a lot of other
people like this blush I should get this
blush I picked up the shade toasted
cinnamon which honestly I use less a
blush and a bronzer and kind of go back
and forth I thought it looked really
pretty and so I went to grab it and
there was no prices there was no like
the display was there but there was no
prices anywhere and so I picked it up
and I kind of was looking at it and I
was like I mean Burt's Bees it's
drugstore I'm at CVS like looking at it
I'm like I don't feel like I see
anything like super crazy it probably
shouldn't be like in my mind I was like
oh five or six dollars I don't know a
single blush really can't be that much
so I finished out the rest of my
shopping and I go to checkout and I
remember when he told me the total I
thought dang what did I spend all my
money on like I know I was buying my
printer paper and I think maybe about
like makeup wipes or something like I
bought a few other things as well but
still the total in my mind I was like
dang I didn't think it was gonna be that
high and I get my car to look at the
receipt this was ten dollars ten dollars
first single blush from CVS I was like
oh dang it I think if I knew that I
probably wouldn't have bought the blush
you know it could have been something
where I would have waited till I had
some CVS like their reward bucks or
whatever they're called extra care bucks
maybe I would have waited for that I
would have waited for buy one get one
half off even or something but I was
like me and I spent $10 on one blush
from the drugstore though uh that's kind
of a bummer I mean I'd like it I think
it's a nice blush but I still don't know
if I would have paid $10 for it but it
was because they didn't have the prices
up there are you trying to be sneaky CVS
there what are you well it's not about
it's kind of rude
the very last item tenth and final item
and hopefully we write ten sometimes I
don't count my list very correctly but
just the Revlon Photoready insta filter
foundation or something like that and it
is $17.99 it is $18 for a drugstore
foundation like no
oh why why why but I have been seeing
other people and I think maybe Lauren
might have actually mentioned this one
in her video as well but I've seen some
people use it in tutorials and it kind
of has like an interesting concept of
like how the actual product comes out
I've seen a few people use it in their
videos and I remember it was before I
was making the the list for this video I
clicked on it I think it was in
someone's description box so I clicked
on it once and it took me to Ulta and I
remember thinking like well I was not
expecting that price tag and then I just
kind of forgot about it and then when I
was making the list for this video and
then I saw Lauren talking about it I was
like yes I remember clicking that link
and thinking like well that was a lot of
money for a foundation so I've never
tried it myself
I've never purchased it but if you guys
tried this Revlon Photoready insta
filter foundation do you think it's
worth the $18 you were able to snag in a
discount let me know your thoughts down
below but that was the tenth and final
item before drugstore products that I
think I've just too expensive okay so
that is gonna be everything for today's
video talking about ten drops our item
set that I feel like are just too
overpriced
again keep in mind of the disclaimers
that I had to mention at the beginning
of the video when you're gonna be
leaving your comments I would love to
have that some conversations down below
do you agree with me on some of these
products what are some other drugstore
products that you found were too high
and are you also someone like me who you
try to wait for the deals I would love
to know because even though they're
drugstore prices and some of them can
still seem cheaper I still am just a
deal chaser and I want to get the best
deal that I get out there especially
because I do buy me a lot of makeup but
I would love to hear some of your
thoughts and some of your products down
below as always I hope that you guys
enjoyed this video make sure to check
out Lauren's video as well it will be in
my description box and as always if you
guys enjoyed this one I hope that you
will give a thumbs up I hope that you
will also consider subscribing before
you go and I'll catch you guys in at
tomorrow's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
