video I'm so excited to do because it's
gonna be a new collab video and I am
collabing with my friend Kelly good
cheer on YouTube I am so stoked we had a
collab planned a couple of months ago
actually and then she had to do some
traveling for works that we put it on
pause and then we did our group collab
video our dethroned makeup products with
me and four other girls Kelly was
included in that so that we pushed our
collab bag even a little bit further but
we are here today to do our collab and
I'm so excited I love Kelly's channel so
much if you are not yet subscribed to
her if you have not seen her videos yet
of course if she's going to be in my
description box make sure to head over
to our channel check her out let her
know I sent you if you like my content I
think you're gonna like her content I
will say be prepared to always be really
jealous of Kelly's hair as someone who
just like struggles with her hair and
has really flat hair every time I see
Kelly's videos and her hair is like
bouncing and beautiful I'm like jealous
no but she puts out a lot of videos and
a lot of really fun video she is always
coming up with so many good ideas you
see her mention a ton around the beauty
community I feel like because she comes
up with so many fun and tagged videos
she's very creative and very unique over
here so make sure to check her out but
she is actually doing a drugstore week
over on her channel and she asked if I
would want to collab in the finale video
and that's that yes and she did it pull
on her community tab and it seemed like
the most voted on item was to talk about
drugstore products that exceeded our
expectations so she asked if I'd want to
do that video and acid of course so I
have about 10 different products I
believe here that I'm going to talk
about all drugstore and all products
that really really impressed me and
maybe I didn't think they would for our
X Y or Z reason so we're gonna be
talking about drugstore products that
exceeded my expectations today so why
don't we go ahead and get started so
first up I want to talk about this
foundation it's the foundation that I'm
wearing today this is from a covergirl
and it is the vitalist healthy elixir
foundation I'm in the shade 740 which is
a natural beige this is about $10 at
Ulta is a really nice pump on it it's a
really nice glass bottle again for only
$10 which I thought was great this one I
feel like it exceeded my expectations
because I kind of just bought it blindly
I haven't really
heard a lot about it yet I hadn't really
weighed it for any reviews to come out
but when I saw it it just kind of
intrigued me because it's called the
healthy elixir it's supposed to be made
with really good ingredients for the
skin it's supposed to be a foundation
with vitamins and has your SPF 20 in
there but it's just supposed to be good
for the skin and I was curious about it
and again for you know the drugstore
foundation price I was like I'm just
gonna go ahead and give it a shot but I
I can 100% say that I did not expect to
fall in love with this foundation this
is one of my favorite foundations not
just from the drugstore but just in
general this has become one of my
favorite foundations you can see from my
bottle I have made a pretty good dent in
there I just think it's fantastic I just
feel like it makes the skin look so good
like no matter what I'm having a really
really bad skin day actually my chin is
completely broken
I feel like when I put the foundation on
I just feel like it covers really well
without being heavy without being cakey
and it's very long-lasting but I just
love the finish that that gives my skin
and I definitely I wasn't expecting that
for a ten dollar foundation but
covergirl nailed it and I think another
reason to is like not all covergirl
products always like knock it out of the
park for me they're kind of more unlike
the brands you know what I'm saying but
I gave this one a shot and I am very
glad that I did next up I want to talk
about these powders here from a pixie
Beauty pixie Beauty is a drugstore brand
you can find them at Target but they are
kind of more on the higher price but
that doesn't always mean that all of
their products are going to knock it on
the out of the park some pixie products
I don't prefer and others I really
really enjoy these base powders I have
been very impressed with I have a blush
here in a highlight here and these are
just really good face powders and I feel
like I hear a lot of other people saying
really good things about them actually
did receive these in a PR and it was one
of like the first times I was really
trying a pixie beauty so I feel like it
kind of exceeded my expectations in a
way because I didn't really have high
expectations I hadn't really heard a lot
about pixie except for people saying
like oh it's expensive for her drugstore
brand and so I was kind of like oh my
really sure what to expect here but it
get these assent to me and when I first
started trying them I was like wait a
second these are fantastic and then more
you also need to keep hearing more more
people saying like wait a second this
blush is really good this highlight is
really good there are space palettes
that I have from pixie that are really
really good so these run you about 16
dollars each which I do think is high if
you have the target red card and get a
little bit cheaper or if there's ever
like beauty deals I target you can get
it for a little bit cheaper there as
well but I do feel like they are worth
it this blush is in it's called the
glowy powder in Rome rose this is just a
beautiful beautiful blush it looks kind
of intimidating in the pan especially to
me you know what you know a lighter skin
tone I'm like oh is it's gonna be too
dark of me I'm not quite sure but it's
beautiful it has a gorgeous Sheen and it
never looks like too much on the skin
like I can even go in heavy with my
blush brush but it never looks like too
much on the skin and then this other one
here at the highlight I feel like are so
so good this is the glowy powder in
santorini sunset this is a really really
a stunning highlight there is a swatch
of that highlight there in santorini
sunset i had another one as well and
again just a really beautiful highlight
powder very soft but still very
pigmented at the same time looks really
beautiful on the skin but it's not like
too powdery doesn't show a lot of
texture just really really good powder
so I wasn't quite expecting to fall in
love with Pixies face powders but I
definitely did and I would recommend
them both another product here is one
that I just kind of purchased on a whim
it was a new product I hadn't really
seen a lot of reviews yet but I had been
searching for a really good drugstore
brow pencil I felt like a lot of my
pencils that I really preferred for
brows were more high-end and I wanted to
have a more balanced like brow
collection and so I just kind of
purchased this from Ulta one day
Maybelline was having a sale you guys
know that I'm going to talk about the
total temptation brow definer you see me
wearing it a ton I've recommended a ton
I've given those great reviews and if
this doesn't prove it
I just bought two more Maybelline was
having a buy two get one yeah what was
it buy two get one free
sale and I'd wanted to pick up a new
Maybelline fit me concealer cuz I'd run
out a while ago and I was like you know
what I'm just going to get two more
brothels because I'm almost out of this
one so I purchased two more
got the concealer for free oh but this
really is a fantastic brow pencil I have
mine in the shade blonde you have just a
tiny little spooley over here which at
first I was like oh that's weird but
it's not weird it's just different it's
just different from the big ol long
spoolie that you usually get on other
brow pencils but really this is fine it
gets the job done
like I said I am almost like that is all
I have left from this a brow pencil but
I think it's fantastic it's similar in
shape to the goof proof like a teardrop
shape but it's smaller and like thinner
narrower and I just feel like I can get
a really precise yeah full brow when I
use this brow pencil and I was very
impressed again I went on to purchase
two more so like I'm so I got my backups
now this is after I did my makeup back
up drawer cuz I just got my package in
for most of the other weekend but I was
very impressed with these brow products
they're about eight dollars was not
expecting to love it and like loved it
so hard that I immediately had to go out
and repurchase it so Maybelline brow
definer it's a good one all right looks
like on my kids the whole time but if I
did I apologize the second video that
I'm filming today so I'm like I'm tired
I'm tired but next up this highlight
palette this highlight palette is
something else this is from us Phillippe
makeup it's the Solstice highlighting
palette I have only warned us a couple
times now I do have it on my cheeks
today but it is fantastic and I will say
that I kind of went into this like I
already kind of had high expectations
for this palette because I feel like
I've heard about this you know I've
heard about it in the community I've
heard people saying it's good and that
you know I need to try it from sleek
makeup so my my expectations were
already like high ish but it even like
exceeded my high expectations because
these powders in here are phenomenal I
haven't even touched the creams these
two over here are creams I really am not
all that interested in cream highlights
they're just not really my thing but
both of these powders over here are
stunning I just have this lower one on
it today I used this in a recent I think
it was like one of my recent get ready
with me videos it was my day to night
makeup video because I used this one as
my daytime highlight and then I used
this one as like my nighttime look and
like whoa like whoa I've only used the
bottom one today
I don't even feel like I need to add
more highlights I don't even like it's
these highlights are insane it's a
$15.00 palette you do get four different
shades two creams two shimmers you get a
little mirror in here I like the compact
I like the packaging so impressed with
this and I expect it to be impressed and
I was even more impressed from sleek
makeup you nailed it so next up here I
have a mascara this is from Catrice and
this is the rocket or 24 hour extreme
volume mascara I instantly fell in love
with this mascara and I bought it not
hearing about it I don't I'm pretty sure
I'd like I hadn't really heard any
reviews on it or people raving about it
or saying that I needed it I bought it
because I was purchasing the Catrice the
liquid camouflage concealer that they
have because everybody raves about that
one and it was like buy one get one half
off at Ulta for Catrice and I was like I
just need something and I just threw a
mascara into my car why I don't know why
I chose this one I don't even know if I
know that answer but I purchased this
one not really thinking anything of it
and was so impressed this is a
waterproof mascara this was one of my
go-to mascaras in the summer I think it
does great things for length but it also
does really really good things for
volume and I need both I'm just super
impressed a very very black mascara
again it's waterproof we play sand
volleyball in the summers and if I was
wearing makeup - volleyball is almost
always wearing this a Catrice at mascara
it went out of town with me when we were
traveling in the summer because it
stayed put I didn't have to worry about
it falling onto my face onto my eyelids
anything like that so very impressed
like this was one that I just kind of
like randomly took a chance on and I was
very impressed with this mascara next up
here I have these lipsticks and these
are from NYX these are the liquid suede
lipsticks so these are liquid suede I
actually do have a shade on today I have
a soft-spoken on these I was curious
about for a while because I liked the
NYX lip lingeries I love the soft matte
lip creams from NYX and every once in a
while I was hearing about these and I
was mostly hearing about these like in
dupe videos people would have a high-end
lipstick and they'd be like oh or or you
can find a dupe
liquid suede at the felt like that's why
I kept hearing about these and so many
times I like I would have one in my
hands at like CVS or Ulta and then I put
it back like I just I just don't know
these are about seven or eight dollars
at drugstores but I was just like you
know why I'm not I'm not completely sold
on it and once I got them I actually
received these in a PR package from NYX
they send me the entire line which was
so exciting I was so disappointed with
myself of why did I not purchased these
sooner because they aren't really really
good they definitely exceeded my
expectations and I was just like oh
girlfriend you you you could have been
loving on these months ahead of time but
instead for whatever reason I kept
holding back I wasn't fully sold on them
and now I am fully sold on them it's a
very comfortable formula I love the
matte look that it gives I love that
it's long lasting they don't dry down
completely matte and there's a little
bit of transfer with them but just a
little bit but also the pigment still
stays on for a really good amount of
time especially for a drugstore lipstick
and again I really like how comfortable
it is
I don't like super super super drying
liquid lipsticks and I really do like
this formula especially for the price
and they have some really cool colors in
the line as well
they have like purples and blues and
like a really kind of like dark greenish
blue color that everyone said well I'm
feeling wild I'll bust it out but yeah I
just the NYX liquid suede very
impressive oz definitely exceeded my
expectations this next one here is from
Jake at beauty it's the you glow girl
base highlighter I feel like I've
mentioned this a handful of times on my
channel my friend Mickey did some this
to me and I was so excited because I I
just feel like I don't really hear about
Jake at Beauty a lot I don't feel like I
see a ton of products being mentioned or
used from the brand so and I got this
one I was like well this is a really
beautiful highlighter I like the rose in
here like I could tell looking at it
that I had like a little purple shift to
it so I was like oh I'm interested but
it is a really beautiful highlight so
there it is underneath the pixie one I
think it's really stunning it shows up
so easily it's a really cool color but I
also just really like how it looks on
the skin it's like it's like different
but not like so different you know how
there's like a lot of you like
holographic hi
it's out right now and things like that
it's like leaning towards that side but
it's not like too crazy you know what
I'm saying so I really do like this one
it's about nine dollars for the Jake at
highlights and again this was one that I
really didn't have a lot of expectations
for because I hadn't really heard about
the brand so I kind of went into it like
mmm will this be any good I don't know
how come people aren't talking about it
if it's good but now I'm like how long
people are talking about it it's not
good hi laughing so you go Jake it you
go I have some different lip products to
talk about here and this one is a newer
one to me but so so good and I was not
expecting that this again is from pixie
beauty and these are their new Matt last
liquid lipsticks the shade I have here
is a pastel petal if you watched my
February lip pics where I shared all the
different lipsticks I wore in my videos
throughout February you saw this one
twice I believe it was these are really
good
lipsticks and again I don't know why I
went into this one maybe not expecting
as good of things maybe it's because
with pixie I feel like I've liked their
face products but I was a little unsure
of how a lipstick would go especially a
liquid lipstick you know I kind of was a
little bit hesitant about it but these
are really really good lipsticks they
are a little bit higher again for pixie
at $14 but they are just really good
liquid lipsticks so this is what the
wand looks like I loved wands like this
on liquid lipsticks I love the pointy
ends I just feel like they're really
nice as someone who doesn't wear lip
liner a ton it's really nice to be able
to line my lips with an applicator like
this the shade is absolutely beautiful
I'll go ahead and do a swatch here I
feel like it's a really opaque liquid
lipstick I feel like it lasts a really
long time I feel like it just looks so
good on the lips again this shade is in
pastel petals are really really nice
liquid lipsticks wasn't quite expecting
that from pixie but yes these are really
good next up here I have these from
Jordana if you are following my March
Madness series I mentioned Jordana in
the lipstick category there and I wanted
to mention them because I feel like I
don't really hear a lot of people talk
about Jordana like in general but I also
don't hear a ton about these a sweet
cream matte liquid lip colors and I
that they're really good I kind of
randomly bought them from a Walgreens I
mean this was probably like last year or
maybe you've been a little bit longer I
kind of just randomly picked up tiramisu
I'm not really sure what called me to it
is maybe it was the name sweet cream
Matt got my attention I'm a tiramisu
look like a fun shade so I went ahead
and purchased it and I have been very
impressed with these this is what the
applicator looks like so it's a lot
different than the pixie these are about
eight dollars I think that they're
really good liquid lipsticks they last a
really long time but they are more of a
drying formula so I will say that for
them these are eight dollars this one
here is tiramisu they're eight dollars
but I do feel like they hold up for a
really good amount of time the other one
I have here is buttercream frosting
which is the one that is in my March
Madness this one is a really pale nude
right there I just feel like they're
really nice and again I because I
haven't heard much about Jordana about
the brand or about these lipsticks in
general I kind of went into it like are
these going to be any good I'm not
really sure cuz like when you don't hear
people talking about things and you
don't see them like hyped all over
YouTube it's kind of like who is it cuz
they're not under good I don't know but
now these are these are really good I
like these blanks at from at Jordana and
then the final item I have here is like
one of my old school favorites if you
will this is from number 7 it is their
caravel bronzer I think these are called
like the match made bronzers or
something like that this has been a
staple bronzer in my collection for
quite some time and I just really like
this bronzer I wanted to mention it
because I know I really like number
seven I like their skincare I like a lot
of their makeup products and they the
makeup is no longer being sold at Ulta I
can still see the skincare on the
website but I'm not really sure I'm not
really sure what's going on there and I
get a lot of different questions about
number seven and I'm like I don't know
either to start at trying number seven
makeup I was almost a little bit
hesitant about it because I love their
skincare so much I was like ooh is their
makeup really gonna be any good though
and I've been very impressed with a lot
of the products but especially this
bronzer and I feel like I've seen more
and more people start to fall in love
with this bronzer which makes me very
happy because I think it's a good one
but after this one from number seven
that's gonna be it for my drugstore
products that exceeded my expectations
I guess so that is going to do it for
today's video talking about some
drugstore products that I just
highly highly loved highly recommend and
that might have exceeded my expectations
