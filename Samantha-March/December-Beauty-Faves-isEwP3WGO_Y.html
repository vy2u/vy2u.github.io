today I'm going to be sharing my
December beauty favorites I have quite a
few of them I also filming those so so
late so I basically have this much
lighting happening so why don't we just
go ahead and have it on my skincare to
start off with and a while back I think
was in my Sephora haul I mentioned that
I got a kid from first aid beauty and I
have three things from that kit that I'm
just like all about I do like the other
two that came with it was like a vitamin
spray and the ultra firming cream which
honestly don't use a lot i have so many
other moisturizers out right now but
these three I've just been like yes the
first one is their pure skin face
cleanser and I'm just about out of it
these are all like deluxe sizes because
it was a kit that i have bought them in
but i love the cleanser I use it every
single night it kicks off every single
bit of my makeup it's very gentle on my
face which is good because I have
sensitive skin and I'm almost out of it
and i'm going to buy more the thing is
these facial radiance pads and it says
they exfoliate tone and brighten i love
using these because if there's a time
like say i'm not using the first day
beauty cleanser i just use something
else to wipe my face off or like makeup
remover wipes to take all my makeup off
and i feel like i didn't get it all i'll
use one of these pads and they take
everything off there's like two sides to
own one has like rough edges and one is
smooth I like to use the ones with the
rough edges and they're like moistened
in there and it just takes everything
off but it makes my face feels so clean
and like refreshed and revitalized I
love the feeling after I use these I
don't put moisturizer immediately on
afterwards because I just love the
feeling so much that it gives my face
and the last thing is they're ultra
Repair Hydra firm sleeping cream so this
stuff I feel like I've been going
through quite a bit like I don't know if
you can see that i put a fairly
good-sized dent into it because i use
this almost every night sleeping i go
between this and the glam glow mask but
i almost always amusing
something on my face when I sleep I give
myself like maybe one or two nights off
a week but this stuff it feels so good
even when you're putting it on like it
has such a like different consistency
that you almost have to like really rub
your finger in to get product out but I
love it feels really good on the face
and I think it's helping my skincare
I've been using it fairly regularly
fairly regularly every night and I've
been doing pretty well with it so far so
this has been a big hit for me since I
did mention it I have to talk about my
glam glow mask I love this little guy so
much this is one of like the smaller
samples so that's what it looks like in
there and I feel like I'm probably gonna
run out of it any time now but this is
only nineteen dollars on so for the
full-size is like seventy dollars and
that just kind of like freaks me out but
the one I got is the glam glow thirsty
mud hydrating treatment I'm all about
hydrating right now and trying to fake
like the dewy luminous skin because it's
so cold and like we're full on winter
right now we have an arctic blast coming
next week and I'm gonna tank that you
know why not but I've just been loving
this like I said I've been going between
this and the fab the first I beauty
sleeping cream but this stuff
immediately when I put it on my skin it
feels like I've just like splashed
myself with water and I feel like when i
wake up and i go to wash it off like i
just washed it off with an oil the next
morning I feel like you can see a
difference in my skin which I really
appreciate that what products that do
that so absolutely loving glam girl glam
glow and definitely will pick up more
another skincare item i just mentioned
this in my previous video with a spice
box spice locks box I'm so flustered
because it's just it's going to get
pitch dark like any second so I'm like
oh my god trying to go through this but
this is the botanics the power of plants
hydrating day cream so I got this sent
for me from from Influenster in a box
box and I've just am so impressed with
it I have been using it quite a bit you
can see the dent that I put in it like I
mentioned in the previous video it is
very
thick which kind of freaked me out at
first but it doesn't feel heavy on my
skin and it also means i only have to
use a little bit and it goes along the
way i use this almost every single
morning very happy with it this kind of
random thing i wanted to mention and I
don't know if I've talked about this in
a favorites video or not but it's the
cinema secrets their makeup brush
cleaner and like you can see I've put
quite a dent into this one as well this
is just a little guy I think this was
like eight dollars on sephora but i just
wanted to try it out before buying the
big kahuna of it which was more
expensive like maybe twenty-five dollars
i think maybe more this stuff is so good
i don't have a whole lot of makeup
brushes yet and i have like three for my
eyes that i use fairly consistently but
sometimes when i'm doing a makeup look I
want to use one brush for multiple
shades and it be so hard because you try
to wipe it off on a you know paper towel
but there's still some residue left then
you go in with another color and then
you've messed everything up this is so
nice to have and I take this everywhere
with me now when I travel even if I'm
like going to a friend's house to do my
makeup this comes with me because it's
so nice it does not leave your brush wet
so you spray it on there and then you
can wipe your brush off and then boom
it's clean it's dry and I just i'm all
about this i need the big kahuna one
kind of random thing to talk about is my
Beauty Blender and this is actually the
real techniques like makeup sponge i
think they call it and it's sturdy
because i just used it today but to tell
you guys the truth i used my beauty
blender for like my under-eye concealer
and i never used it for my foundation
because I just didn't understand like
why wouldn't i use my foundation brush
why would I use a Beauty Blender it
sounds like it takes a lot of time
there's water in it is it even putting
foundation on what are we doing and I
kept seeing more and more people do it
and I was finally in in like three weeks
ago I was like you know what I'm gonna
try it some of the Maybelline fit me
foundations I feel like are more like
more on the full coverage side for me at
least and sometimes they can feel very
heavy on my skin and
almost kind of give me a cakey look and
so I was like why don't I try the Beauty
Blender with that because you know there
is water in it is damp maybe it'll help
lend it out better and almost kind of
give me a lighter coverage so I don't
run into that problem duh I mean it
works wonderfully and I kind of gotten
away from my Maybelline foundations
because I was worried especially in the
winter when I'm so dry but it would like
cling to my dry patches and just like
not look good using a damp Beauty
Blender fixed it I'm so impressed with
this I'm so happy that I decided to give
it a shot so if you're for some reason
like me and you're a weirdo and you
weren't using your beauty blender for
foundation I definitely recommend it
just blends everything out so well if
you have like a fuller coverage
foundation that maybe you want to use
but you don't want the full coverage try
the Beauty Blender because this is
really saved me you have some eyelashes
to talk about and they're actually the
eyelashes that I'm wearing right now
they are the Buddha beauty lashes am i
doing you're right yeah there's a huge
food abuses in style number seven
Samantha I don't know if you guys will
be able to see that the head by them
because you know Samantha but I'm
wearing them so that's why they are not
in the box I love these lashes so much
they are so like full and thick and
fluffy but they're not overwhelming and
they don't make my eyes heavy which is
really nice and they are so lightweight
I put them on the other day for just
like a random reason and I figured I'd
take them off right away because a lot
of times eyelashes can get heavy and
they can kind of like hurt my eyes I
ended up wearing these all night even
though I was just sitting at home with
my husband and my dog I was like
whatever is the Hooda beauty lashes I
got these at sephora a blush that I have
to talk about that i just mentioned in
my drugstore haul is the Milani baked
blush in luminaux so oh my god I thought
that was the like blush that fell out
apparently there was a little brush
underneath oh there's like a little
brush and mirror under here had no idea
but I thought the blush just fell out
and
take a moment this is luminoso and it is
so beautiful I don't know how I didn't
have this in my life before it's like a
peachy blush it's got a little bit of
shimmer in it I love to wear this on
days where I don't wear a lot of makeup
and I will just go like very minimal on
the eyes maybe some just like just
lashes and um like a beige eyeliner on
my bottom waterline and then I'll load
up on this and put highlighter on and I
feel like I'm just good to go this is so
beautiful if you don't have this you
need to get this to have a couple items
that I want to mention in this bronze of
Champions box and this is from Benefit
Cosmetics and i got it at sephora i know
they did just have this online and it
was in their sale items i think it was
on sale for maybe around like twenty
dollars or so but there's a few items in
here that I want to talk about and one
is like it has to stay put in here I'm
pretty sure so I had to bring the whole
box down but that is the hoola bronzer
which is right here the hoola bronzer is
I feel like very well-loved and very
well known and for a very good reason
this bronzer is just so gorgeous it also
does come with this like itty-bitty like
eat a brush type looking brush to apply
it with which i think is amazing because
that is what i use to apply it because
it's very easy to do it and then kind of
like do that it's very simple but i love
it i think it's great for bronzing i
think it's even great for contouring
because it is it's a very it's not very
warm so it's not warm and it's not
orangi so i just think it can make for a
very good contour as well it is what I'm
wearing today as my bronzer and I just
think it is so beautiful I've been
reaching for it all the time another
item in there is the they're real
mascara and I love this mascara and
sometimes I forget because I put it in
the box and then I put the box up on a
shelf with all my palettes and I kind of
forget that it's there and then I'm like
no why did I forget about this this mess
gara is just bomb it really does make
your eyelashes look longer and fuller
it's beautiful I don't have any problems
getting it off at the end of the night I
just bought a mascara and I'm like
struggling getting it off at the end of
the night with makeup remover don't run
another problem with this they make my
lashes look so good I love this mascara
so another item in there but i have to
mention it like in a combination because
i have stumbled upon like my favorite
new highlighter combination and that is
using the what's up highlighter from
benefit so i have this little sample guy
that came in the box and this is a cream
highlighter so so cream highlight so i
use either my finger or like a brush and
i will dust it on where i want my
highlighter to be and then i will go in
with mary-lou manizer from the bomb i
will go over it with this and it just
makes for a stunning highlight mary-lou
manizer is more on like the pearl
highlighted side and it just I don't
know something about this combination I
am just all about I am sharing pictures
on my Instagram because I just think
it's gorgeous I can put a picture in
here of it I just think it's beautiful I
love it this is another thing like when
I mentioned when I don't wear a lot of
makeup in one day and i will just put a
bunch of like luminoso on and these are
the highlighters that I go with because
they are just so like like you don't
miss this highlight you don't miss it
then I just have to lip products to talk
about and then we are out if you guys
don't follow me on snapchat I was just
snap chatting as I was picking my dog up
from daycare I was like I usually film
videos around two o'clock it's now four
o'clock the day completely got away from
me but I'm really going to try to film
this video I hope the quality comes out
okay because I just have a like stand-up
light behind me but fingers crossed it
works out if you guys don't follow me on
snapchat I will put my little girl from
here because you should because I like
to talk to you get us on snapchat I
think it's cool I gotta snap the other
night from someone in Malaysia and I was
like
so cool but my tulip products that I
need to talk about their kind of similar
in shade so you know what I'm feeling
right now but first is the NYX soft
matte lip cream and this is in the shade
london and i just mentioned this i
believe in like my 2015 drugstore
favorites it's just such a nice brown
nude shade and it dries matte which of
course i really like because i like the
matte lips but it also is very
long-lasting and it doesn't have the
effect of a liquid lipstick where it's
very dry on your lips and kind of like
makes your lips feel super tight all
night it's so much more comfortable than
that on the same side it doesn't last as
long as a liquid lipstick does but it
lasts longer than a regular lipstick
would so it's like I don't know I feel
like it's kind of like the best of both
worlds I really like it it's so soft
when it goes on your lips it's drugstore
it's affordable I love the color it's
very neutral it's easy to wear anywhere
and just been lovin it then another one
is truffle tease and this is from
Maybelline it's not a matte lipstick it
is from the glossy line but I feel like
when I swatch on my hands it looks
really similar and i think i just talked
about this one in my drugstore 12 and it
didn't look too similar next to each
other on camera but on my hand I'm like
these are like the same colors but it's
just a great very very light brown nude
shade and I just think it's perfect when
I bought it and I came home and swatch
it I was like I'm never going to wear
this it's so light it's like you're not
wearing anything at all but it's not if
you put on like three coats of it it
does give you that Brown like tint to
your lips so it still looks like you're
wearing something on your lips but you
don't have to take the time of a liquid
lipstick to put it on it's not a dark
lipstick where you need to be careful
about putting it on it's just it's so
easy and so nice to wear and it's
Maybelline I love their lipstick
formulas and that'll everything that I
have for my December beauty favorites in
the month of december i just said that
right ah ok i'm just hoping we made
through this video and you got
for able to see me fingers crossed but I
hope you guys enjoyed seeing my
favorites I feel like I had a lot more
beauty favorites this month and I think
it's because I'm oh I forgot to talk
about something huh yeah i forgot to
talk about this and this was like when I
was most excited to talk about it's been
staring at me the whole time and I can't
believe I almost prefer me to tell you
guys about this this is the Beca back
light filtering primer Becca backlight
priming filter you know you know what it
is the Beca backlight priming filter
this stuff is amazing I have wanted it
for so long but because it was more on
the expensive side kept holding off kept
holding off and then I heard really good
things about it and then there was the I
think I got it during the vib sale so it
was twenty percent off so I didn't feel
as bad it's so great especially in the
winter as I've been saying I'm like
really dry and all that this stuff has
been a lifesaver I'm wearing it today I
do like wearing it with a matte
foundation I have the Maybelline matte
and poreless on right now because I just
think the balance for for me with
combination skin it's just like a match
made in heaven i don't know if i would
like it with like the Maybelline Dewey
foundation or like the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi I don't know if that would be
like too much luminosity and then I put
highlight on like I feel like my whole
face would just glow but especially used
with a matte foundation I just think the
combination is so gorgeous I'm so happy
that I did get this if you guys have
been back and forth I'm buying it I
definitely do recommend it especially
for the winter months I might not grab
it as much in the summer but especially
for the next four or five months that we
have here hopefully not five maybe just
like three and a half four months of our
winter weather in Iowa this is going to
be my friend okay so that was really all
my December favorites I can't believe I
almost left that out because that was
