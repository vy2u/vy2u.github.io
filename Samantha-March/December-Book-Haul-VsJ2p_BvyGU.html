today's video I'm going to be doing a
book haul so I'm just going to share
some of the books that I've gotten
recently to review on Chiclets plus i
only have like six or seven this month
so not as many as i would normally have
but with the holidays coming up we don't
post anything on chocolate plus on
Christmas Eve or Christmas Day and then
just kind of that whole week of
Christmas is a very lighter schedule
just because I'm usually traveling and
you know people hopefully are not on the
computers as much and we're spending
time with family and all that good stuff
but yeah if you would like to see a few
of the books that I have recently gotten
and when I will be reading and the next
coming weeks please keep watching a so
the first one i have is you'll find me
in manhattan and this is by gelled nap
this is a part of the series our book
one is what happens to men when they
move to Manhattan and book too is we've
always got new york I'm pretty sure I'm
the one that read and reviewed we've
always got new york on Chiclets plus so
when Jill contacted us about reviewing
you'll find me in Manhattan I wanted to
read it myself so I'm looking forward to
reading it I love book set in New York
City it's just so like I don't know
something about books that in New York I
just think is like yeah kk nighty i'm
from amazon it says this is the third
and final book in jail nap series about
love and romance in new york city and we
follow Amelia Hastings as she dates away
around the city that never sleeps exelon
is the body in the landscape and this is
by larissa rinehart and this is actually
booked five in the Cherry Tucker series
and i have read i'm i'm fairly positive
without looking I read every single book
because I love larissa and her writing I
love cherry Tucker I think that you guys
need to read this series if you like a
little bit of mystery in your books so
to give you idea the books are I mean
they are labeled mystery but they're not
like they're the mystery that I like
where if you I have been around my
channel for a little bit you'll know
that I don't really like a lot of scary
or something that's gonna keep me up at
night something that's going to keep me
afraid when my house creaks like that's
not the kind that I like and that is
that way with the charity Tucker series
there's humor in them and there's always
a good mr.
two of like several books I have not
been able to figure out the mystery but
you try to and I just I truly love
cherry Tucker as a character she is
hysterical amazon it says when cherry
Tucker's invited to paint the killed
portrait for the winner of big rack
lodges Hogzilla hunt it seems like a
paid vacation back home in halo a
Hatfield McCoy style standoff builds
between Luke and cherries families she's
ready for a weekend away I hobnobbing
with rich and famous hunters where she
couldn't forget her troubles and nobody
knows her name so I really do recommend
reading the series and probably starting
from book one just honestly because I
love a series so much but then it really
will help as the series goes along if
you've already become like invested and
you know the characters so yeah this is
a series that i recommend it is a love
him or a list them and this is by April
Thomas this is also another book in a
series it is a part of the sunday
afternoon series and it is book to book
one is when a spade isn't a spade that
one I do not believe that I read and
reviewed but I love the way love amor
list him sounded i love the cover i love
the title i was all about it so i
decided to pick this one up and it says
what if one day in one evening all your
shocking secrets came to light as an
oven coming real estate agent at one of
barbados well established firms jolene
osborne spends her days helping people
find their perfect match and she's found
hers in bryan rafi &amp;amp; nash well would you
look at that sounds like something I'm
gonna enjoy a chiclet all the way and
set in Barbados okay the next one that I
have is the widow and this is by Fiona
Barton this was offered to us from
penguin group and this one was one that
normally I would probably pass along to
my review team because it's not like
Chiclets romance it's not on the lighter
side but something about reading the
blurb just kind of hooked me in and
every once in a while I do want to read
something out of my comfort zone because
I just think it keeps life interesting I
mean if I only read the same types of
it's over and over again I don't know if
it would get boring or not because I
don't really do that every once in a
while I throw like a wild card into my
reading list and this one is definitely
going to be my wild card it also i think
really helps to as a writer to to read
all these different genres to see all
these different writers voices and other
voices and how they write the writing
style is the widow by fiona barton it
says for fans of gone girl and the girl
on a train on the train it's an
electrifying thriller that will take you
into the dark spaces that exists between
a husband and wife so if you can
probably tell that is a little bit out
of my comfort zone I actually have not
read gone girl and the girl on the train
I will say I don't read for pleasure and
that might sound strange but what I mean
by that is that i don't read anything
outside of what i'm reviewing for
chiclet plus or queries that i'm reading
for marching inc I don't just I i simply
just don't have the time our review
schedule is always so busy my review
schedule is always just so packed that i
can't pick up books just for the fun of
it and be able to read them and so a lot
of times like people ask me like have
you read The Hunger Games now have you
read Fifty Shades of Grey no unless it's
being asked to my little book blog I'm
not reading them and so when I say is
like I don't read for pleasure that's
what I mean because to me I mean reading
is my happy space this is why I started
a book blog so to clear the air there
but no I have not read or seen the movie
I know gone girls a movie I don't know
about the girl on the train have not
read those and then just from that like
electrifying a thriller I'm like who I'm
probably gonna have to read this when my
husband's in the house so I'm not as
scared but it says when the police
started asking questions jean taylor
turned into a different woman one who
enabled her and her husband to carry on
when more bad things began to happen but
that woman's husband died last week and
Jean doesn't have to be her anymore I'm
already getting scared just reading this
there's a lot Jean hasn't said over the
years about their crime her husband was
suspected of committing she was too busy
being the perfect wife standing by her
man while living with the
glares and the anonymous harassment now
there's no reason to stay quiet there
are people who want to hear her story
they want to know what it was like
living with that man she can tell them
that there were secrets there are 0
there always are in a marriage the truth
that's all anyone wants but the one
lesson gene has learned in the past few
years is that she can't make those you
can't make people believe anything holy
crap ok so that's why I read the
synopsis one this was offered to check
Allah Plus that I was like I'll read it
because yes that's out of my comfort
zone but holy Toledo I was only going to
read you a short bit have that synapses
like I usually do in these book called
videos and I was like no you guys you
have to hear this whole thing so that is
the widow by Fiona Parton I will be sure
to give you my thoughts the next one
that i have is wild games and this is by
mila rossi i hope i'm saying that right
I actually just got this one today as
I'm filming this video I just came in
this morning so I'm pretty excited about
it the cover i'm not sure like drove me
wild but we'll see how it goes of course
we don't judge a book by it's cover
that's not what we do but it says
despite warnings of annoying mosquitoes
and beasley spiders Becca Glover
couldn't be more excited about her
expedition to Costa Rica rooming with
Matt Ritter however as an inconvenience
she doesn't see coming he wields a
machete shaves with a knife and needs to
wear a decent amount of clothes to cover
the muscles she can't stop laughing at
and the last paragraph says hot
temperatures wild animals and a shared
treehouse are just the beginning of
Becca advanced obstacles the real
challenge lies and surviving each other
so that does sound pretty good I feel
like I probably will enjoyed this book
so again that was wild games by mila
Rossi the last 1i have to share is the
juggling act and this is by carolyn
maloney Scott I got this with CLP blog

for your book you want to get more
exposure on social media or more book
reviews I hope you will check us out but
this is the juggling act this is booked
three in the rom-com on the edge series
the first one is there are no men and
the second one is afraid of her shadow
now we have had both books on Chiclets
plus I've read and reviewed the second
one afraid of her shadow and another
reviewer reviewed the first one and then
when Carol came to us was afraid of her
shadow I don't know why but I was like I
want to read this one even though i had
a reviewer who I'm sure probably woulda
retic she read book one but I was like
I'm gonna take this one and so then when
the juggling act came out I was like I'm
gonna I'm gonna take that one too
because I had a really good time with
afraid of her shadow I really love the
juggling xcover I'm really attracted to
that like light purple that's in there
and the gold liked that so from amazon
it says now that her dating days are
friendly behind her Claire is enjoying a
blissful life with her new husband and
baby boy gone are the drunken nights in
impractical shoes and internet dates
with men who lose their hair and their
pants and let's see um all these books
are stand-alones so that's why it didn't
really bother me to read the second one
when I haven't read the first because
Carol makes sure to point out that these
can be read as stand-alones but they all
you know kind of feature the same people
but you won't be lost if you read out of
order and so to keep going it says
unfortunately she's discovering that
life as a married working mom isn't
turning out to be the perfect happily
ever after she dreamed about she adores
her little boy but her husband's
behavior is about to make him eligible
for the most disappointing spouse of the
Year award so you can tell from the
synapses there is a lot of humor in
these books afraid of her shadow I don't
know for when I read like or when I saw
the title I maybe wasn't thinking so
much comedy was going to be in it but
there is it's really funny if you guys
like funny books you like romantic
comedies this is definitely a series to
check out and I'm looking forward to
reading though that is my latest book
haul I hope you guys enjoy seeing the
books that I have
coming up on my reading list please do

you do like these kind of videos

I hope some of the books looks
interesting to you if you guys are going
to pick any of them up or you have
already picked some of them up and they
happen to be in your TBR please do
comment below and let me know I would
love to hear what you are reading and
what you have coming up I don't think I
have much else left to say besides
marching ink did recently just do the
cover reveal for our next novel that
we're putting out marching ink is the
publishing company that I own January
27th we're releasing our next novel it
is called going for two is by Laura
Chapman i will put the cover in here so
you guys can see it this is part of a
series it is her queen of the league
series first and goal came out a few
months ago and basically if you guys
like football I'm a huge football fan if
you guys follow me anywhere you know I'm
die hard for green bag but basically
it's like a girl who joins her fantasy
football league at her work because she
has moved she's trying to get to know
people she works at a car dealership so
it's with a lot of guys so she gets to
join their fantasy football league to
try to like make some new friends and of
course there's like romance involved and
all that good stuff so we meet her in
every one in first and goal and now the
series continues with going for two I
don't want to spoil anything in case you
haven't read first and goal so I'm not
going to say too much about the book I
want you guys to be able to see it for
yourself but we did just reveal the
cover this week and the book is also
available for pre-order on both amazon
and Kobo i will have the links to both
of those below if you guys do want to
pre-order it it does go on sale January
27th I'm so excited for this book i
absolutely love laura i love her books I
love being able to work with her she's
such a passionate author and it's just
it's wonderful to be able to work with
someone like that every single day
because we talk every single day Laura
also is a Big Green Bay Fan so we often
chat with each other during games and
some of our conversations crack me up
because the game who else watch the game
with the Packers of the line and the
Hail Mary and oh my god that was the
most insane thing i've ever seen and i
remember immediately like Facebook
messaging Laura and said something
totally completely inappropriate just
like the first thing that went into my
mind I said it to her and then I'm like
I hope she doesn't mind that I said that
because that was a lot of foul language
and I'm normally not a foul language
group to in my professional setting and
so that was kind of funny but I I don't
think she mind it with her response back
but it's so awesome to be able to
connect with people like that it's you
know it makes my job so much more
wonderful so but anyways I could go on
forever about Laura going for to
marching ink etc but just check the
description box below i hope this sounds
like something that you want to read
because i am very excited for this book
to release in january but i think that
is all I have left to say for now please

catch you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
