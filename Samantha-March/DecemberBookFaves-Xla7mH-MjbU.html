today's video I'm going to be going
through our December book favorites on
Chiclets plus so this is all the books
that we reviewed on chocolate plus in
the month of December the gap five stars
either from myself or someone from my
review team now I did just do my 2015
book favorites so if you have not seen
that video yet i will link it down below
but i will also put it up here if you
guys want to go check that out that is
me picking my top favorite 15 books from
the entire year of 2015 that i read and
sharing them with you guys it took me a
while to come up with the list but i
think it's a good one and i hope you
guys will definitely check that video
out if you can but yeah why don't we
just go ahead and hop into the december
book favors when I have to talk about is
actually one that I mentioned in my 2015
favorites and it's Plan B from Hillary
grossman so we sure did like I said I
hope you will check the video anyways if
you haven't but that is ones that are
reviewed like December third or
something and I give it five stars but I
just knew I had to include it on my list
of book favorites for 2015 because I
loved it that much so the next ones that
I have that I gave 25 that I gave 5
stars2 is Christmas confessions and
cocktails and this is by Vicki Lesage
and the full title is Christmas
confessions and cocktails a humorous
holiday my more was sassy drink recipes
I was very excited to read those I read
this just a few weeks before Christmas
so I was starting to read more holiday
books and holiday novellas and I thought
a humorous memoir like I don't read a
lot of memoirs but I was like you know
I'll give it a go then it has these
drink recipes in here to like we could
probably get a log I enjoyed this so
much I what I read it so quickly and it
was one of the books that I kept looking
at my kindle to see how much time i had
left in the book and as we were getting
out there like I found myself reading it
more slower because I wanted to prolong
it do you guys do that with books that
you really like like I was like no I
don't want it to be over yet I'm having
so much
that Vicki just goes through a bunch of
like funny scenarios that happened to
her around Christmas time it's super
interesting to read if s wants to
restart because why not has just been
sitting unused for five days but the
moment I want to use it it needs to
restart I absolutely loved it it went by
very quickly it was super funny and it
does have a little cute like drink
recipes at the end of each chapter and
definitely want that I think you should
check out the next one I got five stars
is so gern and this is by cecilia london
and it says it is the ballot or saga
book number three annie is the one that
read and reviewed this one and gave a 5
stars and i believe that she has read
the entire series she's read books 1 and
2 in there as well those books are
booked one is dissident and book 2 is
conscious yes she has run and reviewed
both of those books so this was book
number three it says haunted by her
experience at the Fed Carolyn tries to
create a new identity a new present a
new future she can't escape the memories
that dog her when she least expected
leaving her mired and a depression that
she finds difficult to escape so she
needs to regain her physical and mental
strength if she intends on surviving the
journey to find elusive rebellion but
that's easier said than done with the
ghosts of the past constantly whispering
in her ear my surface just really is
intent on restarting but that is sojourn
from cecilia london next one that i gave
5 stars2 is another one that was on my
2015's favorite list and this is whisper
if you need me by deena silver and i
mentioned the video that I'm just a huge
fan of Athena silver I've read all of
her books I've really enjoyed all of
them I was with her when she I was not
with her you know physically but I was
with her as a fan when she first put out
her first debut novel and I've just been
a fan ever since I like to follow her on
social media I think she's really fun
there and this was her first why a book
so if you're a fan of Hawaii I know I
don't talk about why a a whole lot on my
channel because I don't read a lot of it
and really the only reason why I read
this one was because I knew it was from
Dina and so I thought let's give it a
chance and I ended up just highly loving
it I think that is really interesting i
get asked sometimes from authors that I
work with like I want to write a book
but I've only written Chiclets and now I
want to write a mystery book do you
think I should write it under another
name and some authors do that so if we
can sell it as lunch who she has written
under two names um JK Rowling I think it
came out that she wrote something
completely different under a different
name and like didn't let anyone know
when she put that book out that it was
written by her it can be a good idea but
at the same time there are so many books
that I would not have grabbed how do I
have not known the author so I think it
can work both ways but i will say that i
was the only reason that i read this
particular why a book it's just because
i knew it was from Dina and I like to
read her books so food for that but that
was whisper if you need me another
Christmas book on there this is
Christmas ever after by Sarah Morgan and
annie is the one who reviewed this one
she called it a very charming Christmas
story it's so much fun like such a good
way to get into the holiday spirit by
reading these Christmas books I just I
was like all about it this year I don't
know I don't know why um but actually
I'm looking on the amazon page right now
on my surface and there is nothing there
there's no summary it's completely blank
it just tells me the price I don't know
if it's because it's a UK book like and
I'm on the US website but there's no
summary there so there's that but I will
leave all of the review links aren't
chocolate plus in the description box
below as well as their amazon link in
case you do want to check any of these
books out the next on that guy five
stars is the wedding tree and this is by
Robin Welles and Annie rona reviewed
this one and her last line and her
reviews that it was riveting and
engrossing
and you want to read this love story so
from amazon it says national
best-selling author Robin Welles weaves
a moving epic that stretches from
modern-day Louisiana to World War two
air in New Orleans and back again and
this multi-generational tale of love
loss and redemption next one is another
five-star review from Annie and I'm not
totally sure I'm going to say this right
but it is Maddie sees daughter and it is
by Sophie Perrin not Sophie pair no not
totally sure it says in the winter of
1564 the beautiful young princess Margo
is summoned to her mother's household
where her true education begins in
earnest Queen Katherine is intimidating
and unmoving presence in France even as
her country recovers from the first of
many devastating religious wars eager to
be an obedient daughter Margo embraces
her role as a pawn to be married out to
the most convenient bitter homeboy Margo
leaves the man she loves for Henry a
leader and notorious heretic yet Queen
Catherine's games are endless and Marcos
brother plus Vengeous in the streets of
Paris my decease daughter is historical
fiction at its finest weaving a unique
coming-of-age story and forbidden love
with one of the most dramatic and
violent events in French history so if
you are a fan of historical fiction that
sounds really good so quick note on my
service I went to like backspace to type
in the next book and I'm pretty sure I
hit by now with one click so i think i
just bought Medusa's daughter and that's
a $13 you book and i got five star
review is chance harbor and this is by
holly robinson and annie also gave this
one five stars thought Catherine and Zoe
who are sisters but even their mother
Eve admits her daughters are nothing
alike Catherines common responsible Zoe
passionate and rebellious no video
surprised when Zoe gets pregnant drops
out of college and spirals into a drug
addiction one night Catherine gets a
call from Zoe's terrified daughter
willow saying her mother has abandoned
her in a bus station and disappears Eve
blames herself while Catherine unable to
have children is delighted to raise
willow on her own now five years later
he was grieving
husband's death and making reluctant
plans to sell the family's beloved
summer home on Prince Edward Island but
a series of unexpected revelations will
up on the family and rock three
generations of women that sounds really
good if I could have accidentally one
clipped something probably that one s
when I got five stars is a story of like
a decidedly unromantic romance novel and
this is bio Courtney Clark Michelle
reviewed this one and gave it five stars
and said it is such a hilarious novel it
says he's every woman's idea of the
perfect man a middle income job a
receding hairline that only mr. clean
would envy and a body fit for the
Paralympics who could resist looks like
our main character is Addison Anderson
Addison Anderson a little bit of a
tongue twister but yeah that's very
curious i decieded Lee unromantic
romance novel very interesting Annie
also read and reviewed saving Jason by
EJ Hannigan and gave this one a five
star review and it says this book as an
emotionally moving look at PTSD and the
intersection of three lives saving Jason
is a riveting glimpse into unexpected
friendships and the ripples we leave
without our knowledge and then the final
five star review of December the final
five star review of 2015 on Chiclets
plus its kind of drew a blank there what
your way in I don't know but the final
book review it was very cool that I
posted this one on December 31st on New
Year's Eve and so it's kind of fun to be
like hey here's our last book review of
the year on chocolate fluff and oh by
the way it's five stars so that was
pretty cool but the book is at the big
lead and this is by libby Kirsch it is
book one in the Stella Reynolds mystery
series I do love a good mystery I talk
about my love for mr. he's quite a bit
here on my channel so i was pretty
excited to read this one and this was
just one that like from page one I was
like yeah this is going to be good
because there is a really good mystery
element involved and there's a lot of
intrigue and suspense and you know all
that good stuff you
a mystery novel but at the same time I
found it to be very humorous I was
laughing during certain points there are
characters like the neighbor I believe
her name was Janet the neighbor that
Stella meets like when she has to still
be living in a hotel when she first
moves for her new job she had some
really hysterical moments in there
especially at the end and I just thought
it was really good I had a very
enjoyable time reading it had to give it
five stars and very much looking forward
to the next book in the series so that
is everything that I have for the month
of December that we gave 5 stars2 on
