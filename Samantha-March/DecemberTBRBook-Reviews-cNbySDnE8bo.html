today's video I'm going to be going for
line December reading list and reviewing
all of the books on here that I reviewed
on chocolate plus in the month of
December so I have done a full like wrap
up of my 2015 favorites that video is
live and I can link it in the
description box below and then I did
also just go through our December book
favorites on chocolate Plus as a whole
and that's all the books on chocolate
plus either from myself or someone from
my review team that we gave 5 stars2 so
I do have that video running I can link
it in here and put it in the description
box below but these are just all of the
books that I reviewed in the month of
December no matter what stars I gave
them that i will be sharing a little bit
more on here so if you would like to see
my december reading list and what I
thought of all the books I read please
keep watching ok so the first one that i
have is sex snow and mistletoe and this
is by laura bernard and this is one I
right at the very beginning of the month
as soon as I was getting into like the
holiday books and the holiday novellas
this is a holiday novella so it is only
99 cents on amazon um if you can't tell
from the title because we do have the
word sex in there it is a little bit on
the seamier side when it comes to view
certain scenes so I do definitely
recommend that she'd be older if you
want to check this book out but I really
really enjoyed it like I said it's a
novella so it was a very quick read but
I felt too like the plot was still very
strong sometimes in novellas it can be
like the story is so short that I I'm
almost kind of like what why why did why
did we do that but with this 1i thought
the plot was very strong I thought it
was very funny and the ending I was kind
of like I think I know where this is
going and it's bad but the ending
actually surprised me and I really
enjoyed this one and I gave it four
stars the next one that I reviewed in
December is plan B and this is by Hilary
Grossman now this is actually a book
that I mentioned in just my 2015 book
favorites I picked 15
my favorite books from 2015 to share and
this is one of them so again that video
will be linked below if you want to
check that one out and so I won't get
into into too much detail with it here
because I went into more detail in that
video and also my December book faves
but definitely if you're a fan of
women's fiction this is what I recommend
to you if you'd in December is Dorothy
Parker drank here and this is by Ellen
Meister and this was a book that just
sounded very unique to me when I was
reading the synopsis for it and I even
did mention it in my review that I
thought it was a unique read because
basically we are kind of following
Dorothy Parker who is a ghost then
they're in a TV producer that is
basically trying to find an author and
get him on the show and she'll think
it'll turn her show around the show is
about to be canceled and when she thinks
if she can just get an interview with
this Ted driver it'll all be good and
along the way Ted is at this hotel that
Dorothy is constantly at and Dorothy
gets involved with Nora and there's a
lot of definitely like interesting
scenes there's even some funny scenes in
there some heartwarming scenes and sad
scenes but i will say in the beginning
it took me a little bit to like fully
engage in the book mostly because it is
very different like I'm even I'm kind of
struggling to describe the book to you
because it's so unique just kind of took
me several chapters to really become
invested in the story and get involved
with it there is a little bit of a twist
in the plot point that I kind of saw
coming because as so on a whole like say
the book is unique within with this plot
twist I was like I could see that coming
from a mile away because that's happens
in every book like that sort of things I
was kind of like oh did we have to go
there with this one but overall I did
enjoy it I gave it four stars and I
really like the writing the next one
that I reviewed is guarded by Angela
Carell and this was another one where it
just kind of took me a little bit of
time to get fully into the book i will
say that i really really love this cover
i just thought like with the colors it's
um it was just so i catching to me that
I really wanted to read it but yeah I
took me a little bit of time to get in
there but what I enjoy probably most
about the story is that it goes back
from present to past and there's not a
whole lot of the past runnin like it's
not like dual chapters we go present
past present past but it's just every
once in a while the past would come in
here in the form of like letters and I
really really enjoyed that part I love
that about books I think they're so much
fun to read and this one I thought the
same for that so I enjoyed that aspect
of it just what it started off
maybe a little bit faster but overall I
thought it was really good and gave it
four stars another holiday book that I
read is Christmas confessions and
cocktails and this was by Vicki lesage
now I did give this one five stars so I
did mention it in my December book
favorites video which again will be
linked in the description box below as
well as for all the books that i
mentioned i will have my link to my
review on chocolate plus and also there
amazon link if you are interested in
checking any of them out i also read
whisper if you need me by dina silver
and this is a young adult book and i
don't usually read a lot of young adult
but i wanted to read this one because
i'm familiar with the author and I love
her books and I did give this one five
stars so not only did i mention it in my
december book favorites but I option
included it in my 2015 book favorites
because I loved it that much so if
you're a fan of ye i would definitely
check this one out the next one that i
read and reviewed is the new mrs. D and
this is by heather hill and this is one
that I believe I hauled here on YouTube
and as I was reading the synopsis you
could tell it was basically reading it
for the first time because i was
actually kind of surprised because for
some reason the cover I and I don't know
what I had heard about it I thought
maybe it was Chiclets but actually was a
lot deeper than that and basically it's
we follow Bernice and her marriage her
very new marriage is in big trouble and
her husband has actually addicted to
porn and it causes all kinds of trouble
while they're in their honeymoon and
Greece basically they split apart like
Bernice isn't even sure she can be
married to him anymore because of all
the problems that his addiction is
causing and she goes out and basically
is like trying to find herself again
like trying to understand who she is
what she's looking for there's a lot of
like self-worth in the book and and that
sort of thing which I really enjoyed and
it was fun to see kind of like the
adventure Bernice goes on in the midst
of all of this and the friendship just
that she forms I'm I did mention in my
review I don't know if I love the
decision that she made at the end but I
respect it and overall I gave the book
four and a half stars and then the very
last book that i have to mention is the
big lead and this is by libby Kirsch
this is another one that I gave 5 stars2
and I did mention it in my December book
favorites I it is a mystery book but
it's very humorous so if you enjoy
mystery with a touch of laughter I would
be sure to check this one out alright so
