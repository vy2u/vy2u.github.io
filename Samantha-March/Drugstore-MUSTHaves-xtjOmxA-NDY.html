today's video is going to be my top must
have makeup products from the drugstore
but I want to reiterate that it's from
the drugstore this is not drug store /
affordable these are from brands that
you can buy at like CVS Walgreens
Walmart even target you know brands that
you can actually go into and physically
buy them from a store so there's not
going to be anything affordable in here
like colour-pop morphe things where you
actually have to order them online or at
like specialty stores this is going to
be for the drugstore only I'm really
excited to do this video because i had a
couple different drugstore themed video
ideas in mind and i wasn't sure which
one I wanted to do first or if I wanted
to do them at all and I asked my lovely
snapchat squad what you guys wanted to
see or if you wanted to see them and the
majority vote was to see this video so I
just want to say thank you guys so much
because you really really helped me out
over there sometimes I have ideas in my
mind and then I come to you guys and the
response was like oh no like good idea
but no what about this and this is what
we really want to see and it helps me so
much because all of the videos that I
have asked for your guys's opinions on
and you've given me them those have been
like my most watched most viewed most
commented most liked videos so obviously
you guys are steering me the right way
and I appreciate that so much but
without further ado let's look at my
drugstore favorites wanted to these to
be my favorite favorite must have but
what I would absolutely recommend two
guys there was plenty of products that I
had that I was like I like this or I
like this right now type of products but
not something you know I want to mention
products that I've been using for a long
time that I really really believe in and
that I would be repurchasing myself when
I run out of these so I don't have a lot
for each category but i think i actually
covered most categories so hopping into
it let's start with primer my favorite
primer since i bought it it's from
maybelline it's their blur and
illuminate primer i use it so much to
love it if you're looking for a good
emanating primer this is one but I
actually think it does the blurring
better than it does the illuminating and
I appreciate that in a primer I had not
found that from the drugstore yet I was
only finding good blurring primers for
the more high-end but this one I think
is a good one I'm almost out of it and I
would repurchase this one so I just have
two foundations to talk about and that
kind of surprised me because I actually
really like drugstore foundation I have
a majority drugstore foundation but when
I was going through and deciding like
what's what I reach for almost every
single day what's what I take traveling
with me I could only come up with two so
the first one that I have is from
maybelline is from their fit me line
it's the fit me matte and poreless this
is such a good mattifying foundation
when I'm feeling a little extra oily or
like a lot of times in the summer this
is the foundation that I gravitate
towards because I tend to get more oily
in the summertime and it is bomb it is
full coverage on me in my opinion
sometimes if I want to make it just a
little bit sheer i'll just use a damp
Beauty Blender to apply it with but such
a good foundation I love so many of the
different Maybelline foundations but the
matte and poreless is my favorite and
then the other foundation that I
actually reach for even more than the
Maybelline baton poreless like if I
could have only have chosen one
foundation to future this would have
been the foundation that I went with and
it's from lore'l and it's the true Match
Lumi I love this foundation I love it so
much I actually the other day I was like
I'm running low on this and then I went
to CVS later that night and I was like
do I need to get more of the Lord like I
cannot run out of this foundation once I
started to get down there I'm getting a
new one mine's really dirty because I
used it today but it's so nice because
it even has a pump on it which is just
so handy the Maybelline you have to dump
out in your hand which is not pretty but
this is like my go-to foundation there
actually is a setting powder from the
drugstore that i want to mention i use
this in so many different tutorials and
when I was deciding if i wanted to use
it because i know setting powder isn't
like the most exciting thing and maybe
that and a must-have for everybody I
don't use it myself personally on a
daily basis but when I want long lasting
makeup or I'm going to a special event I
we'll set my foundation and when I was
thinking about it I was like yeah if I
ran out of this I would buy more of it
because I believe in it that much it's
from Maybelline it's their setting and
perfecting loose powder looks like this
I think it's amazing not only for
setting the foundation but I truly think
it gives the skin like a very flawless
finish and for that reason i love it
actually hopped outta order quickly but
one more like face product that i did
want to mention is from maybelline it's
their dream fresh bb-8 and one beauty
balm skin Perfector it looks like this
you guys i've been using this BB cream
for years and years i have this phone in
my drawer and then i have two other ones
in my drawer because i just stock up on
them like when there's Maybelline sales
and I maybe only have like one left of
these i buy more because I believe in it
that much I love rooting for BB creams
in the summer when you want something a
little bit lighter on the skin or you
know you don't feel like you need a full
face a foundation or you're just like
running to the be on a boat or something
this is what I reach for and I think it
is just bomb so another setting powder
that i have been using for years this is
one of the very first products that i
ever bought when i started like building
up my makeup collection because it's
just like raved about ever everyone
loves us it's the Rimmel stay matte
translucent powder it looks like this
I've used it in so many of my tutorials
and seriously I've had it for so long
and it looks like i have not put a dent
in it it's crazy I feel like I'm never
going to run out of the stuff but this
is what I use to like set my under eye
concealer and other places where I put
the concealer on to highlight my face
this is what I use to have it stay in
place and to not crease I think it's
amazing and it's so so affordable total
must have product is a must-have for me
for not only the setting powder but also
the contour powder you guys should not
be surprised from wet'n'wild it is their
contouring palettes mine is in Dolce de
leche I believe they have two different
shades of this I mean I use it all the
time I'm always talking about it it's
been mentioned in favorites videos I
just think it is amazing not only for
the setting powder which I really really
love like I love this setting
I probably use this and the rimmel
fairly close to like half and half of
brightens up the under eyes which i
think is so so pretty but the contour
shade is amazing as well like i love
this contour shade so much and this
palette is bomb it's like five dollars
everybody needs this so i have two
different concealers to talk about which
kind of also surprised me as well cuz i
have a lot of different concealers but
again i made myself sit down and think
about it which are the two that I take
with me what do I use every day and the
answer was just completely obvious the
first one is from Maybelline it's their
instant Avery one concealer I mean this
is like a favorite of so many of this is
I think my third one that I have I will
continue to repurchases there's no
question about it this does amazing
things to hide dark circles under eyes
when I'm looking tired looking this is
the first thing that I come in with even
just like before I put concealer on to
like use it as a highlight I'm hiding
dark circles this is what i'm using it's
amazing then another concealer that
again i hope this is not a surprise to
people but it is the Maybelline fit me
concealer mine is almost out can you see
I'm like scraping along the bottoms of
it because I love it so much and this
will definitely be repurchased and now
I'm mad at myself because like I said I
was just at CBS the other night I should
have bought a backup of these because
this is going to be out any day now for
eyeshadows I actually kind of had a
tough time figuring out I shadows
because I just don't have a lot of drug
store I shadows that are really
gravitate Taurus and like none of the
palettes have really worked out for me
but I kept digging around in my drawer
and I was like wait a second duh like
these these ones are must-haves for me
from l'oreal they are they're infallible
eyeshadow they look like this i have had
these for several years and i have worn
them over and over and over again I
think the Loreal infallible shadows are
such a cool formula I love it I think
they look so pretty on the eyes if there
is only one eye shadow from the
drugstore that I can rent recommend it's
the Loreal infallible so it's kind of
the same for me with a blush I do not
have a lot of drug store blushes that
I'm like oh my gosh totally array
have to have it can't live without it so
I just have one blush to share with you
guys but you guys know then that means
like this is a very special blush ain't
nobody gonna be surprised at this one
because it is from Milani and it is the
luminosa blush I mean hello who's
surprised not me not you this blush is a
favorite of so many people so many
people actually when I first got on
youtube I realized that I didn't have a
whole lot of drug store blushes and I
was asking people for recommendations
and everybody everybody said luminosa
when I was like okay I gotta get it it's
like a cult favorite for such a good
reason it's such a beautiful like peachy
shimmery bronzy color you can use it
with so many different looks you can use
it as like a blush and highlight like I
mean it's just it's gorgeous I will
never run out of luminoso in my
collection never got have it so I'm kind
of like an eyeliner junkie I love
eyeliner it's like the one thing like if
I can't put anything else on before I
leave the house I'm gonna put eyeliner
on like I just feel very naked and young
looking when I don't have eyeliner on so
I have a few different liners to talk
about one okay once not really a liner
it's a jumbo eye pencil and it's from
NYX it looks like this so I wouldn't
really categorize this as an eyeliner
it's more like I use it as like a base
for an eyeshadow a lot sometimes i use
it for like cut creases but sometimes i
do the white on my life bottom waterline
and i do use it as an eyeliner but man
you've got to have this in your
collection this is such a staple totally
recommend so this next eyeliner is one
that I have had in my collection for I
mean since since high school since
College since college for sure and I
think since high school I just keep
rewriting it Andrew buying it are you
buying it and I always will I don't feel
like I talked about it enough on my
channel but seriously this is like one
that I reach for all the time it's from
Maybelline it's the unstoppable eyeliner
but what I love so much about it is the
shade that is in which i believe is
sapphire yeah so it's just a really
pretty like dark blue color and it for
me it just pops the eyes so much which I
didn't think blue and would make green
eyes pop as much as this does
telling you like if I just need
something very very quick I will take
this and kind of smudge it onto my
eyelid and kind of like be messy with it
smudge it out and I'm good you know put
it on the waterline but then that's it
that's good this was like my go-to look
for so long before I knew how to do
makeup so no light like before I knew
how to do makeup what I would do is I
would pick that l'oreal infallible in
iced lattÃ© I would put it all over my
lid I would take this in the sapphire
and I would put it on my top lash line
and then I would kind of smudge them
together and put this on my waterline
and put mascara on that's what I did
every day that's what I look like in
college that's what I looked like two
other eye liners that I want to
highlight one that I think that it
should be in everyone's collection is a
like nude beige something like that type
of eyeliner my favorite that I've been
using for years is from Rimmel it's
their exaggerated eye liner it looks
like this I guess I dremel is really
really affordable I don't know it says
exaggerated yeah I think that's the
cliff note the color is in the nude so
this is in the nude this is really good
this is actually what i have on my
waterline right now using a lighter
color on the waterline can help really
make your eyes pop and look more more
awake and brighter which i think is
really important and there some times
where I just don't want to use black in
my waterline like it looks too harsh or
it doesn't go with a look and I just
think nude is such a big staple to have
in your collection another that I think
is really important is obviously a good
like liquidy type of eyeliner gel liners
are okay they're not my favorite so I'm
not going to recommend any because I
don't feel like I have any to recommend
but this is more of the liquid liner
it's from Maybelline and it is the
master precise eyeliner and it has like
a felt tip type of applicator but it's
really really sharp at the end this has
been like my saving grace for making a
wing I have tried a lot of different
eyeliners like i said i've tried july
eyeliners I've tried liquid eyeliners
with more like a brush tip nothing
worked out for me with making a wing and
I am still really new and makeup so I
needed something to better help me and
this can
lately save the day when I run out of
this I will be getting another one
because it's just it's been my go-to of
course I think eyelashes are a must-have
because i love eyelashes I loved
eyelashes even before I got on YouTube
you know even when I wasn't always
exactly sure how to do my makeup I just
loved putting eyelashes on because I
have such teeny tiny little eyelashes
like I just eyelashes are my thing so
definitely the eyelashes from the
drugstore obviously are going to be the
ardell lashes I love ardell lashes I
will constantly recommend these they're
just amazing they're super simple to use
whether you're a beginner or whether
you're more in the knowledge of makeup
like people still use the art dells
they're affordable so many times like I
stock up on them when it's like buy one
get one half off or even buy one get one
free I've seen with the our doll lashes
then I just buy a lot because I love our
doll lashes or almost done and now we're
just going to move on to lips so lip
liner I don't think is super duper
important to me personally I wear a lot
of liquid lipsticks a lot of them I
don't feel like I need lip liner with
but some you do i'm wearing Katherine
from Anastasia Beverly Hills today like
the anastacio formula does need a lip
liner and so I do have a lip liner on
today but I do think that they are a
must-have for your collection because
you never know when you will need a lip
liner and when you need a lip liner and
you don't have one that sucks or when
you need a lip liner you have one but
you don't have a pencil sharpener and
you can't sharpen your pencil so you
can't use it guess who that has happened
to many many times but the lip liners
that I'm definitely gonna recommend
these have been my favorites and I'm
wearing one today but they are from NYX
Cosmetics so these are the two I have if
you can tell which one I use more I mean
hello this is the nude which obviously I
use quite a bit I just use nude lip
liners a lot even with this dark lip I
wasn't sure what lip I was gonna wear
and I just went in with lip liner was
like I'm just going to use the nude of
course but I can't help it I think nude
lip liner so much easier to work with if
you use a dark one sometimes if you mess
up
it's very noticeable versus using more
of the nude shade hub liners are also
very cool because they can help kind of
manipulate the colors the only thing i
don't like about the knicks is that they
are not like creamy like the colour-pop
ones I think are very creamy even like
Jordana which isn't my favorite but I
think they're okay they're more unlike
the creamy side which can help with
liquid lipsticks but still if I just had
to buy one drugstore lip liner i'm gonna
bet from NYX kidding again before we get
into the actual lipsticks I almost
forgot mascara well can't forget mascara
especially because this I love this
mascara so much so my favorite mascara i
will say i'm not a big drugstore mascara
person this is a mascara that I reach
for all the time and I actually just put
it head-to-head with a very popular hi
add mascara in my dukes video and this
one it is the Maybelline lash
sensational I love this mascara I use it
all the time when I wrote out of it I'm
getting more I think it's bomb it's just
like surveying my desk to see like did I
miss anything else did I get it all but
now for the last category we're moving
on to lips I have two different ones
that i want to recommend to you the
first would be from NYX and they are the
soft matte lip creams I actually do have
another one but it's in my purse right
now because I wore it over the weekend I
love the soft matte lip creams I only
have three of them but I need so many
more of these like I wish I could have
them all even there's like a million
shades out there but they are affordable
I love the formula there most of them
are very pigmented i have rome and i
have to say i don't think realm is as
pigmented as a london or Milan those who
I think show up so much better like Rome
I'd have to kind of apply a few more
layers to it i don't know if it's
because it's a darker color or what but
mostly i think they are very pigmented
but they last a long time but they also
don't feel as drying on the lips as a
normal liquid lipstick they don't last
as long as a normal liquid lipstick but
they also don't do like the weird drying
down inner lip thing they're just so
much more comfortable on the lips and oh
love these if anyone asks me for a
drugstore lip recommendation like you
just want a good lipstick from the
drugstore eyes
maybelline this is not even i just
grabbed for this is not my phone
Maybelline lipstick collection I have
probably 8 to 10 maybelline lipsticks
because i love them like if maybelline's
having a really good sale i'm like i
don't need another lipstick but i'm
gonna buy more because i love them i
love the glossy which these two are
glossy and i love the mat even just tell
like by their packaging like this has
like the glass to it and this is
actually really cool like Matt packaging
I love the glossy I love the math I love
the nudes I love the darks I love the
bright colors I love them all if that is
just hands down no matter who asks me
I've had a friend my age asked me what
looks like they should get from the
drugstore I said Maybelline I had my 16
year old niece ask me which drugstore
lipstick she should get I said
Maybelline like Maybelline is just I
think their lipstick formula is amazing
and I'm talking about these lips x i'm
not talking about like their vivid
liquid mats or anything like that like
their regular lipstick line this is what
i recommend hands down my favorite
lipstick from the drugstore that is
going to be everything for my top
drugstore pics my must-haves from the
drugstore much older children would call
