in today's video this is going to be a
skincare focused video I'm going to be
talking about three different products
from the brand Ella Frieda this video is
going to be sponsored by cyst skincare
brands I'll let you guys know what I'm
working with brands on video and I was
very excited and curious when they
reached out to me to be honest I have
skincare companies reached out to me I
mean multiple times a day and most of
them I have to turn down because
skincare is not something like makeup or
you can just constantly be changing
around I mean you can if you want but
especially for me and for my skin when I
really disrupt my skincare routine at my
skin will freak out and I think I have
found a pretty decent skincare routine
I've figured out what works for me
and so I really just can't do it to
myself I can't do it to my skin the last
time I gave it a try and completely
changed up my skincare routine my skin
just freaked out and I dealt with so
many breakouts and other really unwanted
things on my face for a very long time
I'm not always super open to mixing up
my skincare but some when Ella free to
reached out and they explained to me
what their products for it they actually
had two products in here that I was most
interested in because of being gradients
in them and they were actually what I
was looking to add into my skincare the
nice thing about what they send along is
I have two different moisturizers to
talk about and then also the hyaluronic
acid serum so instead of giving a whole
bunch of cleansers and moisturizers and
exfoliator and masks and serums and all
these different things that or I was
going to have to completely change up my
skincare routine I was able to make
small changes and add in things and
ingredients and products that I was
actively looking for to add into my
skincare so that is why I really wanted
to be able to test out these products
from this brand and let you guys know
what I think about them I have been
using all of these for about one month
now and on a daily basis and then I also
wanted to just let you guys know why I
was looking for these certain
ingredients in my skincare and why I
thought it would be a good idea for me
to test them out so I hope to not make
this like an educational video because
I'm now a skincare expert I have no
training or anything like that in the
skincare area I just do a lot of
research and read a lot of different
articles watch a lot of different
YouTube videos and then I try to you
know make my decisions from there but I
really wanted to let you guys know why
some of these products really piqued my
interest so a big thank you to Elif Rita
for reaching out to me and allowing me
to make this video with them these
products can be found on Amazon so I'll
have the Amazon links listed down below
and then I know Ella Frieda was sending
over a ten percent coupon code as well
so that will also be in the description
box in case that you do want to try
these products or you're interested in
about some of the ingredients in here
I'll have the Amazon links listed down
below so why don't we just go ahead and
get started
okay so the first one that I have is the
facial moisturizer this is what I have
been using in the a.m
and this actually works out pretty well
for me because I have my am skincare
routine down pretty well sometimes at
night and then like on the weekends I
like mix it up and add in like fun masks
and things like that but my and skincare
is pretty much set but I'd actually just
run out of my moisturizer so again this
is what I use every morning and this is
what the inside looks like I have been
using it like I said for about one month
now and I feel like I barely put a dent
in it there was a lot of product on this
little guy at which I don't know why I'm
one of those people that when this light
comes on things I always put it back as
does anybody else do that I do that for
a very long time until I finally just
stop getting annoyed with it but
sometimes I'll leave it on there the
whole time so a lot of times when I
first started I was scraping product off
of this at first does anybody else do
that or am I just weird that's what I
was doing and so I was using this in the
morning what I really liked about this
moisturizer is that it was very
lightweight
I really cannot stand heavy moisturizers
I don't like moisturizers that are like
super white when you put it on your face
will click you have sunscreen I've
talked about these tips and moisturizers
in the past in review videos and how I
just don't like thick white moisturizers
it's just I'm not a fan of them at all
so I really enjoyed how lightweight this
was absolutely clear and a very little
bit goes Oh
way it's awesome because that means that
it can have this for a very long time on
Amazon this is 1498 so $15 for two fluid
ounces of product I do not find that to
be a bad price at all I do have some
high-end skincare in my collection and
the moisturizer that I was using
previously was in the $60 range which is
very very pricey so to be able to have
this and see that it's $15 and for how
much product you're getting for how
little product you have to let use how
long that it can wash you I really think
that's a pretty fantastic deal so I'm
going to talk about some of the
ingredients like I said I'm not a nut
skin care expert I'm not trained in any
of this stuff so I'm sure I'm going to
mispronounce things so please bear with
me but some of the ingredients in here
are sodium hip high low rate and retinol
palmitate Paul makes okay so suppose we
deep moisturizing and anti-aging that
says is good for sensitive or oily skin
now I have a sensitive skin so when I
see products that say they are good for
sensitive skin I'm like perfect because
that is what I need and sometimes that's
why my face can freak out so bad when I
change and try other products because I
do have a sensitive skin so with those
key ingredients I have some notes on my
phone here because I knew I wasn't
available to memorize all of this has
antioxidant protection against UV rays
which is a huge plus for me another good
thing about this is that it doesn't
leave any sort of greasy feeling and
like I mentioned before it's not super
heavy and it's not white like it's isn't
going to feel like you're putting on
sunscreen which sometimes moisturizers
can do so the retinol coming in here is
a form of vitamin A and then in my notes
I have that it helps to stimulate
collagen production increase cellular
cellular rejuvenation and decrease pore
size creating stuff person with their
skins are all great things have been
also one thing that I thought was really
interesting that it says well does the
retinol palmitate considered to be a
gentler milder form of vitamin A but
also this is often used in sunscreens
because of its antioxidant properties
and gentle nature so I thought that was
really good too and like I mentioned
earlier it helps ward off damage caused
by UV rays that's really important
especially to me like I said I use this
in the morning so
and I have something that can help
protect from like the Sun when I go out
that day I think that's a really huge
deal and something that I definitely
look for in a moisturizer so that's just
some information about the actual
ingredients and this moisturizer but
like I said I think this is a really
good a.m. moisturizer I will continue
using it I mean when I decided that I
was going to do this video of course
it's not just like a send me them I try
them out for two days and then make a
video type of thing because if I were to
start using these products and my face
would flare up or I'd have any sort of
issues with it
that I would not have been able to make
this video and that has happened in the
past and I have had to not make a video
because I was not able to mesh with
skincare and that happens but because
I've been using this for a month I mean
I'm not going to stop using it just
because I'm out of my review period
because I actually really do like this
moisturizer mostly facial moisturizer
that I use in a.m. and it is $15 so even
though I was really excited to hear a
new moisturizer because this is one
thing I didn't say I am like a freak
about moisturizing I moisturize in the
evening I moisturize in the morning
usually moisturize sometime during the
day I've usually moisturize my face
before I do my makeup prep I do a lot of
makeup prep videos on Instagram and I'm
usually using some type of moisturizer
in their moisturizer I definitely think
it's very important but these next two
products I'm going to talk about are the
main reasons why I decided to say yes to
Ella Freitas making this video into
testing out these products the first one
is the hyaluronic acid serum I hear a
lot of people talk about hyaluronic acid
how fantastic it is how people need it
I'm like okay but why what does it do so
again how I said I want to take this
video kind of educational because as I
was looking things up like sure I was
seeing on social media in other people's
videos like you need this this needs
being your skin care and my question was
why like what does it do
and I feel like I found a lot of really
interesting facts from this so
hyaluronic acid is a nationally
occurring carbohydrate in the human body
it provides moisture plumpness firmness
and supplements to the skin all
fantastic Fenton's right but I was
interesting it says one gram or 0.0 3
ounces of hyaluronic acid can hold up to
six liters of water I don't even
understand like that's like my fog going
to me and I thought this fact is really
interesting this was from the Ellis
to say they say how like a baby's skin
you know how it always looks so like you
know like you always say like you want
to have a baby skin I have an
exfoliating water that I've been using
recently and even says right on there
like it will make your skin baby smooth
so it says it's because babies are born
with a high level of hyaluronic acid
which keeps their skin as plump and
smooth but the amount of hyaluronic acid
in the skin diminishes with age and
significantly after the age of 40 as in
ten years for your girl so I'm like
runnig acid is also supposed to be good
for any skin types for your oily dry
combo it is supposed to help for
everybody it also has a lightweight
texture which I definitely agree with
this feels like when I put some on my
fingers it feels like I have like almost
nothing on my fingers and then when I
rub it into my face it's just
immediately like sinks right into the
skin and I go from there it doesn't feel
like I'm putting anything heavy doesn't
feel like I'm putting a cream on my face
anything like that it definitely has the
very lightweight serum feel another good
thing about it is that it is good for
sensitive skin which again this is
something that I always look for because
I do have sensitive skin so if you're
someone like me with sensitive skin this
will also be safe for you and that was
one thing that was like the main thing
that I wanted to research because when
you see the word acid I feel like it can
cause like a red flag like look what
exactly am i putting on my skin but it
is okay for sensitive skin and I would
absolutely agree with that I use this in
the morning before like I will cleanse
my face I put this on and then I follow
up
what's the Amoy stirrer Iser I've been
using this every single morning and this
is something like once I read through
everything and I read about how
fantastic it is for your skin and how
much moisture is getting like I said I'm
a big freak about moisturizing once I
saw that like this is stuff that has
traveled with me a lot of times when I
travel I don't take my full skincare
regimen with me I've been taking my like
my little travel sized bottles or I'll
take a makeup remover wipes you know I
don't usually bring my huge bottles of
cleanser and things like that but this
was something that I have been taking it
that it was really important and I want
to keep using it on a daily basis but
one other thing that I thought was
interesting it does it has a natural
calming benefit which means it can help
some skin as well as blemish prone skin
so if maybe you are someone who deals
with a lot of acne a lot of blemishes
this
be good for that as well I also thought
this was interesting because around the
time that I was using it I was dealing
with a lot of breakouts and I hadn't
figured out what exactly it was from yet
and I mean I was having like both really
painful like under the skin at first
type of pimples and even my Mario
Badescu like the drying out lotion that
I have but not even that was helping me
and I was like crap what is going on and
I'm sorry using this and I've been able
to tell a huge difference in my skin
those breakouts have definitely calmed
down and even my husband has been
dealing a lot with breakouts lately like
he's been using the Mario Badescu and
was telling me I don't know if it's just
because I'm stressed at work or what it
is but his face just like what's going
crazy and so we are now sharing this
bottle so I wanted to help him out and
the good thing is that his face is
definitely calming down as well so our
blemish prone having a hyaluronic acid
could definitely help as well so once I
started looking into what I could
definitely tell that there was going to
be a lot of benefits with having the
hyaluronic acid serum like I said this
has been probably my favorite you'll get
one fluid ounce of product and this is
about $15 on Amazon which again I don't
think it's a bad price America that I
just use it the one time in the morning
after I cleanse my face I apply this and
then I saw it with my moisturizer for
the eye cream on and I'm good to go to
start my day so I've really been liking
this if you don't have a hyaluronic acid
serum in your collection yet hopefully
what I just explained helps you figure
out if this is something that you need
in your collection again like I said I
was being told a lot that I needed it
but I wasn't really understanding why
are the benefits of it so hopefully some
of that information helped you guys out
so the last product that I have is
another moisturizer but this was the one
that really sealed the deal for me that
I was like yes I need this because I was
just talking to a girlfriend on
Instagram she shared a skincare photo
and she was talking about the benefits
of retinol and how people need retinol
in their skincare
especially if you are concerned about
like anti-aging and wanting to build up
your skincare products there that you
need retinol and I said I calm down her
photo and I said oh my gosh I don't have
any retinol in my skincare she knows I
just turned 30 and
kind of like freaked out about that fact
because you know I was like you're 30
now like whoa and she's like girlfriend
what are you doing like you need retinol
look okay and I was just just searching
to get products that have retinol in it
for my skincare routine when Ella free
to reach Tala and when I look at their
products and I saw a retinol moisturizer
I was like oh my gosh I'd be friends all
and then it went into okay so why do I
need it I know it's good for anti-aging
that's what I learned from my friends
stuff but why do I need a retinol
moisturizer this is what the retinol
moisturizer looks like it comes it looks
very similar to the facial moisturizer
and again I'm like that weirdo that
keeps the plastic I have no idea why I
do this and then this is definitely like
a thicker cream then the moisturizer is
that I use in the a.m. but it still has
more of a lightweight feeling to it it
is just a bit heavier and has more like
the al moisturizers completely clear
this has a bit of the white tinge to it
but once you rub it into your face it
completely disappears so you do get two
fluid ounces that same as the other
moisturizer and this is about $18 on the
Amazon website again I don't feel like
that's a bad price for what it is you're
getting and the benefits of a retinol so
from my notes I thought it was very
interesting looking on the Ella Frida
website were the first things it says is
that dermatologists consider retinol the
holy grail of non-invasive wrinkle
prevention I mean can you just sign me
up right there because myself it has
think this is a vitamin a derivative and
it stimulates collagen production and
cell turnover which reduces the
appearance of fine lines even out
complexion and unclogged sport I always
hear about cell turnover I was just
talking about I think it was the sk2
essence and that was one thing it
mentioned cell turnover there was
another skincare product that I was
talking about I think in my Sephora
wishlist video that talked about cell
turnover like this is a big deal so when
I saw that I was like okay I understand
this is a need retinol in my life I get
it as a threaten all you can see
improvement with fine lines at dark
spots texture and the tone of your skin
so even though retinol is you know
fantastic and has a lot of great
benefits I was also glad that I was
doing our research because I found that
there also can definitely be some
drawbacks to using the retinol and then
you have sensitive skin this was
something that really stuck out to me
because it can cause like dryness
peeling or skineri irritation some
people will recommend using a retinol
moisture there every other night to make
sure that your skin can handle it and
that you don't have any of those adverse
affects me having a sense of skin when I
saw that I was like okay I'm not using
this every night right off the bat I
will use it every other night I did not
notice anything negatives when I was
doing it every other night I had no real
dryness to my skin I had no peeling to
my skin anything like that was not
irritated at all when I use this so
after about a week of doing every other
night I moved it to every night and
again still I have had no issues so
that's definitely something I want to
recommend I mean for everybody but
especially if you do have some ciske and
try that every other night make sure
that you don't have any of those effects
and then you can go from there so I've
been able to use this every night
without any problem the thing about
retinol is that it can kind of like
increase your skin to being prone to the
UV rays so when you are consistently
using the retinol you do want to be
using other products that do have SPF or
some sort of UV ray protection which is
good because that is actually what the
am facial moisturizer has and it so it's
kind of like combating that as well so
that's something to be importan of if
you don't use a moisturizer only
products with SPF in it and you do
regularly use the retinol moisturizer
you could be more prone to sunburn sun
damage that sort of thing so again the
retinol moisture in there was definitely
the one that I had like piqued my
interest the most because it is supposed
to be so good for anti-aging for the
fine lines for the wrinkles for what I
am most concerned about with my skincare
right now you know maybe if you are in
your teens you're in your early 20s
maybe you don't have quite those
concerns yet you lucky dog for you but
if you are starting to get concerned
about that or you just want to start
preventing anti-aging preventing is
something that I think it's super
important as well you might want to
check out something was retinol in it
and this retinol moisturizer I have been
finding myself getting along with very
very well I get like I said it
more affordable to me from from the
other retinol moisturizers that I have
found so it's only $18 I think that is a
really good price but this was one that
I was definitely very excited to try I
will keep using this every night again
of course because I want to make sure
that I see those benefits from having
some time to aging skincare in my line
as well but that was the final product
that was sent to me at the retinol
moisturizer so those are the three
products that were sent to me by Ella
Freda that I have been able to test out
and share my thoughts and feedback on I
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
and you found it helpful I didn't just
want to sit up here and say like you
need this product and mute this product
and more wanted to explain what it is
ingredients how it works who is good for
that sort of thing because when with
skincare we are all very different we
all have very different skin care needs
and because something works for me and
might not work for you you know that
sort of thing so I wanted to try to make
this somewhat educational without
sounding like I totally know what I'm
doing because I don't want to I don't
want anyone think that like I'm some
sort of like skincare expert or trained
I'm definitely not I just wanted to be
able to take the time and do some
research so I could talk to you a little
bit more in depth about each of these
products but I have been very impressed
with everything I'm using so far like I
said I will continue to use these
there's a couple that you know I'm
especially excited about the hyaluronic
acid serum just had me so excited like I
said I'm traveling with this I normally
don't travel with my normal skincare
products but this was one that I was
like those needs to keep coming with me
because I'm so excited about it I think
in between a combination of this and
then also the facial moisturizer so I
have very normal skin I don't have super
oily skin I don't have super dry skin
but one thing that this might sound
really weird but I had a dry patch of
skin right along here like right towards
the edges my eyebrow and then all along
this side of my temple and there was a
point where it was even getting into my
eyebrows because when I would go to do
my brows and I was fully through them
like dead skin was falling into my
lashes and it was getting really bad and
I could tell that patch of dry skin was
getting bigger and I mean to say has no
idea what it was about it wasn't on this
side it was only on this side I didn't
have dry patches anywhere else on my
face except for my right
it was very strange since I have started
using these products that drive hatch is
completely gone
it is not they're nowhere to be seen and
I am super thankful for that because it
was really annoying especially with
certain foundation there like I said
when I was like rushing through to do my
eyebrows I was dealing with a dead skin
and sometimes if I took out liner or
eyeshadow really far I would run into
the dry skin over there I'm like what
the heck is going on so because this is
so good with moisturizing but then this
how it says how this is just like
basically like the most fantastic
moisture there ever I think in between
the combo of using these it cleared that
patch right up so I was super thankful
for that and then again like I mentioned
I think that this was good for my
breakouts that I was dealing with and
also that I have my husband on it now
too because his skin has definitely
calmed down since he started using this
as well so that makes me really happy
it's definitely some feedback that I
wanted to deliver as well and like I
said these are very big jars of rosy
moisturizers these are very big jars
these are going to last me a really long
time I have only been using them for a
month but I feel like from using the
retinol I've been dealing with pretty
bad wrinkles like right here in the
middle of my forehead and I can tell
that they are starting to lessen which I
am so thankful for this is a part of my
night skincare routine and take my
makeup off I cleanse my face this is
what I use before I go to bed it has
replaced like any of my sleeping creams
that I've used I am now using this
Monday through Friday as part of my
normal skincare routine and I feel like
I can tell that these between my
eyebrows are starting to not look as
fierce hopefully that will keep
continuing as I keep using it but that
is something that I feel like I've
noticed from using the retinol as well
again it's supposed to be excellent for
anti-aging which is what I want to be
focusing my skincare on definitely right
now and I am now officially in my 30s
but those are kind of my reviews and
feedback and hopefully a little
educational portion on these products
from Ella Frieda as well again a really
big thank you to them for reaching out
to me and for sponsoring this video and

into my routine that I've been really
