so today's video is going to be a collab
video in a tag video and I'm really
excited for it but basically Alex from
Beauty attic next door she's been one of
my YouTube friends for very long time
now and actually the first youtuber that
I ever did a collab video with she
reached out to me and a couple of other
girls and asked if we would like to do a
collab video and do an empowering women
tag I thought that was a fantastic idea
I was completely on board with it and
I'm really excited to do it so we have a
handful of other youtubers that will be
doing this tag as well I will leave
everybody link down below I'll leave
their YouTube channel and their
Instagram at the time that i'm filming
we don't have a confirmed list yet some
people are still you know maybe they can
do it maybe they can't you that sort of
thing so I don't want to list everybody
here because i'm afraid i'm going to
leave someone out to thought maybe they
couldn't do it but then they can do it
and i don't i don't want to like leave
anybody out but be sure to check the
description box because i'll leave
everybody linked it down there but i'm
excited this tag is all about empowering
women which i think is a fantastic idea
also going to do this video completely
makeup-free a lot of times when I do
these kind of more like serious like
chit chat type of videos I've found
myself just not putting makeup on and I
think that's fine I think it's kind of
refreshing to see like beauty youtubers
doing some videos completely makeup free
because usually when we do these videos
were you know in more of a glam type of
mode but I'm gonna skip the makeup i
also just woke up I probably have bed
head and I probably look tired but I got
my coffee next to me so it's all good
but we're just going to go through and
answer some questions so why don't
happen to question number one okay so
the first question is described a moment
that you felt powerless and how you
overcame it if you haven't overcome it
what could you do to overcome it so
describe I really have it i mean i saw
the questions but i haven't really like
thought of my answers because i like
doing things more on the fly but
described a moment that you felt
powerless and how you overcame it and i
have talked about this on my channel
before but i am a survivor of sexual
abuse I was abused by esta brother in my
family when I was 11 years old and you
know even at the age of 11 it's very
interesting of how truly
you powerless you feel but how how much
you know that your life is being changed
forever you know even back in analyst
happened in like 97 or 98 before there
was a lot of like knowledge on the topic
and I still knew even at eleven that my
life will forever be changed because of
someone else's decision to to make that
decision so if that makes any sense but
definitely that was a put a point of my
time where the abuse went on for six
months that I felt you know pretty
powerless the entire time I'm pretty
unsure of what to do and you know how I
overcame it was I finally confided in a
friend who took me to the school
guidance counselor who had made the call
to my mom and my stepdad and we started
the process of you know getting him out
of the house and getting him help and
and all that stuff so it's definitely
something that you know I did feel
powerless at the time and there's still
times where I get really upset about it
like you can probably tell that I'm
upset about it but it also taught me a
lot and it taught me that even as a
young girl that I could be strong and I
could overcome something and I could get
my power back question number two is
described a makeup look that makes you
feel empowered I don't know if I have a
particular make up a look that makes me
feel empowered but one thing that I do
want to say especially since getting on
YouTube is how more empowered I feel
without wearing makeup before I started
a YouTube channel if I ever went
anywhere even if I was just running to
the grocery store for a few items I
would always put some sort of makeup on
my face I'd put a powder on my face I
put eyeliner you would never see me go
out with a completely blank face and
since starting YouTube I have felt so
much more confident like when i first
started YouTube what I think that I
would ever film videos to put out for
thousands of people to watch without
wearing a stitch of makeup on my face no
I wouldn't have thought that but youtube
is definitely gave me a newfound
confidence and I definitely appreciate
that there is times where I mean I'm
constantly going out without makeup on I
went to I was just on my snapchat last
night talking about how i went to a
restaurant with my husband completely
bare faced I have no problem with that
anymore I even wanted to
a party one time like a bunch of friends
work at having a get together at the
house and I showed up completely
makeup-free and I remember one of my
friends was like where you just at the
pool or something I'm like nope I just I
didn't feel like wearing makeup today so
it's interesting that starting a beauty
youtube channel has definitely made me
feel more empowered in my own skin in my
own natural look so the third question
is name a song that makes you feel
empowered one song that I always really
loved was from christina aguilera and is
that called beautiful but it's either
called beautiful or survivor or perhaps
i'm thinking of two different songs that
both made me feel really empowered but i
remember she came out with an album
around the time that i was actually
going through some like physical abuse
from a boyfriend in high school and she
came out with this album and i would
sink so many of her songs like there's a
lot of songs on there that made me feel
empowered and even though this was like
another moment in my life where i was
definitely feeling powerless and i felt
like things were getting really out of
control and i would just listen to that
album on repeat so yeah that was
definitely like that full album I feel
like had had a lot of songs that really
resonated with me so question for is
discussed a moment when you felt
empowered so one moment where I did
definitely feel empowered was the day
that I released my first book so I man
out there if you're new to my channel
welcome but I am an author it's what I
do full-time is I write books I have
four phone like novels out there and I
also just released a holiday novella I
do have a big giveaway going on in the
month november four and so i'll leave
all that information link down below but
writing a book was something that I
always wanted to do since the time that
I was nine years old I knew that I
wanted to write a book one day
interesting because I didn't get a ton
of support with it when I would tell
people I wanted to write a book or as
working on writing a book it was always
kind of met with like but you know
you're not actually going to publish a
book right like really my mom and my
grandmother were like the only like two
really big supporters in my life like
even like friends and other family
members were like why are you writing a
book that's not going to go anywhere
that's not going to do anything and so
when I did publish my first book which
is called destined to fail I definitely
felt a lot of empowerment that day
and I felt like this was a goal I set
out for myself to do and I achieved it
and it was such an awesome feeling okay
question 5 is what is something that you
do to feel empowered um I know it sounds
it might be kind of strange but I look
up encouraging quotes every single day
and a lot of times I post them somewhere
on my social media I've been starting to
post a lot of them to Instagram and I
know a lot of people have been
commenting on those pictures that has a
quote or even sending me a message to
sing like that quote where they meant
something to me and every single time
that I post a quote it's something that
means a lot to me personally and it is
something that you know can pick me up
or can give me some motivation and it
definitely just helps encourage me and
help me get through a day because
someone who struggles with depression
and it's not easy so just taking a few
moments out of the day to look up
encouraging quotes and then not only
just look at them and read them but
really think about the quote and think
about what it means to me in my life
it's definitely a time where I feel
empowered so question 6 is name
something that you love about each of
the youtubers you are collabing with so
this one's kind of hard for me because
like I said I don't have like the exact
confirmed ballistas I'm filming this and
you know some people have been able to
do it and now they're not able to do it
in that sort of thing so I just I don't
want to name some people and then like
forget about some because I feel like
that would be really rude but one thing
that I would say about not only just the
group of women that we're doing the
collab with but so many other of like
the female youtubers out there is how
amazing it is to get the support it's
something that I didn't think would
happen when i first started a YouTube
channel that I would actually be making
friends with other youtubers who do the
same things and that they would become
really a huge support system for me I
leaned on my virtual friends so much you
know we talked to each other almost
every single day we're asking questions
we're being excited for each other's you
know milestones and achievements and
that sort of thing and it's been amazing
because I know a lot of people can maybe
think that you know girls are catty and
all this type of thing and especially
when you throw in beauty you know them
for some reason it just catapults it to
then we're just super duper caddy is all
we care about is makeup and beauty but
that definitely has not been true
um and I've just found so much support
within the YouTube community and the
other females so it's it's amazing and
it's inspiring and it's also very
empowering okay and then we just have
two questions left but number seven is
name something that you love about
yourself one physical and one
personality trait um physical I've
always really loved my eyes and not just
because they're green which I don't know
I feel like green eyes are like somewhat
unique but I really love them because
they're the same as my mom's which I
just always think it's really cool like
we have like the same eyes but one
personality trait that i love about
myself would probably just be my like
motivation there's been so many times in
my life where I've been knocked down not
just one peg but like a lot of pegs and
I'm just always really proud of myself
that I've always been able to stand back
up and fight for what I believe in and
just keep going it's it's something that
I really do admire about myself I'm
sorry if you can see like my arm moving
my dog is right next to me on my chair
and she just she just would prefer to be
in my lap right now but that's not gonna
happen the last question is provide a
tip on how we can power others in
ourselves I think a way to empower
others is to just constantly being nice
I mean it sounds strange but you know
being on social media there's so many
times where I get just crazy comments I
got a death threat the other day over a
makeup tutorial I mean it's just it's
just pure insanity to me that it's 2016
and we still have cyber bullying going
on the way that it does it just it
really does blow my mind because I don't
understand how cyber bullies haven't
figured out that we figured them out
that when you will go to such extremes
to try to cut someone down it's because
you're not happy with yourself like
we've figured it out and you're
unleashing that anger on an innocent
person so it still it confounds me that
cyberbullying is as big as it is but I
try to UM I try to set apart a time
every single day to be on my social
media and in particular Instagram
because it's probably my favorite
platform just going through people's
photos and not only just liking them but
trying to leave comments
like great wing this look is beautiful
or great quote great message that you
said in your photo just something like
that because I think it's too easy to
forget how to not just be nice but to be
vocal about it and I found myself doing
it a lot to arouse just constantly go
onto Instagram and just liking photos
but I wasn't saying anything and you
know sometimes like I like to remind
myself like one comment and a like
leaving one nice comment could
completely change another person's day
because maybe they're having a really
down day and you leave a nice comment
and it could completely changed them so
that's definitely one thing and then the
other part of the question was how to
empower ourselves honestly I feel like
empowering yourself can really come from
empowering others like what I was just
saying about leaving the nice comments
and just doing what you can to be a
better person would make you a better
person and in part I think that's what
can help empower you so I think that is
a really big deal and it's even
something so small as just add an event
this past weekend with some friends and
like a woman came up and like stood
beside beach kind of like bumpin did
mean you know she's like oh I'm sorry I
was like oh no you're fine I love your
sweater it was olive house like I love
that color olive it looks great on you I
mean even just saying something to a
complete stranger you know to just leave
a nice message to them I think is really
important so yeah my dog is just she's
just going crazy right now alright guys
so that is going to be it for this tag
and collab video I really hope that you
guys enjoyed it and hopefully you got a
good message out of it I really do
encourage you to go to the other gals
YouTube channels and watch their videos
as well like i said i'll leave everybody
linked down below their YouTube in their
Instagram so you can follow them and
watch their videos and hear what they
have to say because I think this is a
really important video to do and I'm
very grateful for Alex for reaching out
to me and asking if I would do this tag
video as well I also encourage you you
know if you do have a youtube channel i
hope you'll take some time and do this
tag video as well because i do think
it's really important and i'm really
excited to see what all the other girls
have to say about these questions
because they were very thought provoking
and i'm just i'm excited to hear what
everybody else has to say because i'm
sure we all kind of have like a
different view and
opinion on these questions but thank you
guys so much for watching I really hope
that you enjoyed this video and was able
to take something away from it like I
