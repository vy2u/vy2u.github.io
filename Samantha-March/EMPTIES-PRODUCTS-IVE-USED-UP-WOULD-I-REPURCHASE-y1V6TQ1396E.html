today's video I'm going to be going over
a few of my empty products letting you
guys now products that I've used up if I
would repurchase them kind of doing a
little mini reviews on them and all that
good stuff I have not done an empties
video in a very long time I think I may
be only done like one on my channel in
general but I can't even remember the
last time i did it i think it was like
when I first started and that was a year
ago so I really needed to do another one
but honestly I just don't go through
things super fast a lot of what I'm
going to show you is going to be samples
but I like doing the sample is because
then I actually know if i do want to
repurchase them so i can let you guys
know to like hey I like the samples so
much I decided to purchase the full size
so you guys can kind of get my review
and feedback on that's only time to
throw this trash away I'm getting so
tired of seeing it in my bathroom it's
just been building and building and
building it's time to do spring cleaning
summer's almost here I gotta throw this
stuff away and make room for new fds so
if you would like to see my next round
of empties please keep watching first I
know I haven't years from Kendra and it
is a volumizing shampoo and this is
actually is like the full size of it it
says as it's a shampoo for body and
fullness I think in my last empties
video I did the conditioner because I
went through the conditioner faster but
I have finally used the shampoo go so
I've been so serious about wanting to
get through products that I signed up
for the six by spring six by summer six
by summer challenge with me and a couple
other friends who aren't instagram and
youtube and we pick six items that we
have in our house that like we just need
to use up and we have like this goal in
mind that we're going to try to use up
all 6 by the time we get to summer so
far I've gotten through one the shampoo
I have knocked on a good roll right now
you guys I've known a good role but I
did finally use up this kendra shampoo
and I feel like the six percent
challenge really helped because I would
like in my shower i have so many
different options of shampoos and
conditioners i was like no go for the
kendra go for the Kendra and I finally
finished it kenra was recommended to me
by a hairdresser who I met on a vacation
in actually by honeymoon
st. Lucia and I just was asking her you
know I have such like frizzy hair and
thin hair my hair was like just so
unmanageable what do you recommend and
she recommended Kendra and I completely
agree with that I'm now sold on Kendra
products i love the shampoo the
conditioner i use the dry shampoo like i
have tried a lot of different products
from cameras since and i really really
enjoy them I haven't repurchased this
yet because especially in my influenster
voxbox boxes I keep getting sent shampoo
and conditioner I keep I have so much
shampoo and conditioner in my house
right now it's insanity so I have not
repurchase it yet but if I was all out
of shampoos and conditioners I would
definitely repurchase this one so I
haven't hear from pur Lisse their blue
lotus and white tee treatment see mask I
actually had two of these and I
remembered the second time to put this
one in my empties basket because i
forgot the first time i got this in i
believe it was my april Dipsy bag and i
was so impressed with it this was one of
the first sheet masks that I ever tried
and I was blown away like I really
really did love this I used the first
one and I was like I just can't wait to
use the second one like can I use it
right after i use the first one no let's
navy wait a little bit but I was very
very impressive that it just was so
hydrating like that was all i could
think when i had the mask on was this is
the most hydrating thing i have ever
felt in my life i was so pleased with it
i think they are about eight dollars
because i looked into buying more of
them i believe there are eight dollars
per shade and i will definitely be
getting some of these because they are
bomb I got a sample of the Becca aqua
luminous perfecting foundation and I
think this came in like a sephora order
or something they sent along these
samples and they looked like this and
you would just pull him back obviously I
didn't use like the darkest one because
I didn't think of it matched my skin
tone but I tried the light and the
medium I was excited to try it because
I've been very curious about this
foundation but you know it's quite
expensive and so I was like well if I
could try it out and see if I like at
first I think that would be amazing
these samples covered my nose I mean
that's how tiny tiny bit of product you
got it was not enough product
I even tried because I think I opened
the medium first to try and once I
realized that I covered this much of my
cheek I was like maybe I can try the
light as well and mix it in and you know
that covered that much of my cheeks I
was like well why even what's the point
of even sending out both samples how am
I supposed to I actually gauge if I'm
going to like this for my skin so that
was a huge bummer because I didn't pull
the trigger on getting the foundation
because I just didn't know if I would
like it for my skin so that sample
sucked so this is from strivectin
perhaps and it's a high-potency wrinkle
filler it looks like this I got like
three or four of these after a while
like they just kept coming like in the
my Sephora packages like I wasn't even
asking for them but I just kept getting
the samples of them and so I was like
okay that's kind of cool because you
know I'm sure I can't just use it like
two or three times and expect something
to happen right so I had a bunch of them
and I decided you know I have these
wrinkles in the middle of but you know
between my eyes like everybody feels
like I'm gonna I'm gonna do it every
single night I'm gonna put them on there
and I'm gonna see if anything happens I
kind of thought I was seeing a
difference maybe a little bit but by the
time I was like am I seen a difference I
ran out of them and then I couldn't
really tell so I don't know maybe I
think I was getting there it's
definitely something where you have to
use it I used it every single night for
probably just over two weeks that's how
many samples i had of these and that's
how far the samples went and I thought
that I was seeing something so if you
get it will probably take a little bit
of time to use but I think maybe it was
working maybe and through a nail polish
remover you guys that does not happen
very often I just had this like nail
polish from up and up and I was like
should I mention that I'm like I never
go through nail polish remover so I was
pretty impressed but I definitely
especially since getting on YouTube have
been painting my nails a lot more or
just caring more about what my nails
look like because you know when I show
products I don't want which my actual
nails look like because i do not have
nice nails like you know how some people
don't even have to put like nail polish
on and they just have like strong
looking nice fingernails minor not like
that they peel and crack
they're thin and there they are not cute
so I would definitely stepping up the
nail polish game or which meant i went
through nail polish remover so up and up
from target I repurchased it cartwheel
okay grabbed a few more samples one is
the liquid blender cleanser it looks
like this so it's supposed to be a
liquid cleanser for like your
Beautyblender it said it could also be
used on brushes i also i got this sample
and then i got actually got like a
little jar sample as well that i'm still
going through because i didn't think it
did anything to be honest i just shared
a video on how I cleaned my makeup
brushes and how I clean my beauty
blenders and these were not mentioned at
all because I didn't think it did
anything I also have like a makeup brush
cleaner from ELF I believe it is I don't
think it does anything i just use like
dial soap dove soap and is that all i
use and then i have a cinema secrets
like dry spray that i use and that's
what i used to clean my brushes so this
did absolutely nothing it smelled nice
but it didn't do anything from ahava
this is there time to clear purifying
mud mask it looks like this so I got a
little sample guy of it I got one use
out of it so it was hard to really like
gauge if I think that it did anything to
this skin but I really do like mud masks
I like charcoal masks I just really
enjoy masks and join role but especially
like mud and charcoal I've been really
into a lot lately I think it does a lot
for your pores which is awesome I
actually have more products from the
Ahava line if I'm saying that correctly
and I really do like them so if you're
looking for a good Basques this could be
an option so from me rad I went through
the hydrodynamic quenching essence which
looked like this a little sample guy of
this if i remember correctly i got like
two or three out and it says your two or
three uses out of this that did not make
any sense sorry it says you massage
evenly over clean face neck and chest
and follow with me read step 3
moisturizer so I'm not reading it I was
like quenching essence this was a
moisturizer is this a what is this and I
don't know if I really ever feel like I
got that answer because then it says
follow with a moisturizer or somebody
it was like pre moisturizer I mean it
felt fine on the skin it was like pretty
hydrating but I don't feel I get
something that I like have to have in my
collection well I have a full-size
product from Neutrogena it's the
oil-free acne wash pink grapefruit
foaming scrub it looks like this I
freaking love this I love the pink
neutrogena line the pink grapefruit
neutrogena line the only thing that I
tried from that line and did not like
was like the makeup remover wipes
because they stung my eyes I think
whatever like scented they had to use to
make it the pink grapefruit really stung
my eyes so I would stay away from the
wipes if you don't like that kind of
thing but I went through the foaming
scrub I've gone through a cleanser I
just I really like this new jersey in a
line and I will definitely be purchasing
more from them then from hourglass I had
a sample of their veil primer there was
not a lot in here so I only got one use
out of it it felt nice but I have other
primers that I like just as much so
probably won't be repurchasing it but I
have heard a lot about it felt nice but
I like my other primers just fine from
Kate Somerville I have the exfoliate
which is an intensive exfoliating
treatment it looks like this i also got
sent a lot of these and I'm glad that I
did because I tried them several times
and I do want to repurchase a full size
of this I have not yet but I plan on
doing so it says reveal dramatically
smoother brighter healthier looking skin
in just one use I do have a slightly
sensitive skin and I would notice after
i did use this like my skin was a little
bit you know red and kind of irritated
looking so it says that you can use once
or twice a week I would probably use it
once a week just because it really is
doing stuff to my face if you know what
i mean but i use this pretty regularly
once a week i think is breather like
three or four weeks in a row that i was
using this and i felt like i could see a
noticeable difference in my skin so I do
plan on repurchasing this had a sugar
scrub that has been in my shower and oh
my well I have to have a sugar scrub now
are some sort of scrub in my shower
after you
this but it's from Plainview farm as
their summer rain sugar scrub it looks
like this this was actually sent to me
from an author she sent me her book
called guarded by Angela Carell and then
I think she either like has a farm or
somehow is affiliated because she sent
me like a whole gift basket we actually
did a giveaway like a winner won a gift
basket as well but I had like lotions in
there and soap and then also has this
scrub and I just was obsessed with it it
smelled so good it felt so nice I would
use it like when I was going to self tan
and I would need to exfoliate this is
what I would use it was amazing i was so
sad when i used it up and i was in my
shower like trying to scrape the rest of
it like no it's not yet right i will
tried it my hardest to find the links i
remember it took me a little bit to find
the links last time in a way did they
give away but i'm going to try my
hardest to find those links because this
was amazing oh this is from needles no
more maybe says exclusive tri-blend
wrinkle relaxer it looks like this I
think I had like two samples of these
guys it was supposed to instantly smooth
expression line um I mean I was only
able to try it a couple of times and I
didn't see a noticeable difference i
noticed more of a difference with the
like strivectin i think it was there
like a wrinkle anti-wrinkle thing so i
didn't notice a whole lot with this
unfortunately because like what so i got
a sample from the new estate edit line
by us a ladder they came out with a line
that i edit and I picked up the wider
net this is a sample so I chose a sample
of the dissolve the drama 211 and makeup
remover plus cleanser it looks like this
oh this was wild this kind of blew my
mind I'm not gonna lie you guys I it
took everything off like I I was only
able to get one use out of this but it
took everything off it took off my
eyeliner it took off my mascara it took
off a liquid lipstick oh yeah that
liquid lipstick did not stand a chance
it came right off like it takes
everything off like I don't know I was
pretty impressed by it like i feel like
i want to buy it because there are
certain products that i have in my
I feel like this is good for taking off
mascara this is good for taking off like
what lipstick look I don't really have
like an all in one that takes everything
off so I was very very impressed with
this actually skin ink I had a deep sea
hydrating mask it looks like this this
was another one that like the sample
size was just so small I couldn't even
really get it all over my face so that
was kind of a bummer so I felt like I
couldn't really test it out
unfortunately but I mean I understand
samples but you just kind of got you
gotta make them a little bit bigger
sometime so we can actually try them
that's the point of a simple right
almost I'm just two more products one is
from it's a ten it's the miracle
leave-in treatment it looks like this
mine is the yellow one because it's for
blondes ok so I loved this I actually
got it for free at all today were having
like a hair of it one time and each day
they were having like some sort of
special and I didn't even know about it
just the day that i wouldnt today were
like oh here you get a free like good
sized amount of this leavin miracle
treatment thing I was like cool and I
tried it and I loved it and I don't know
why every time I go back into ulta or
even now when I look at target I can't
find the one for blondes like I don't
know i'll probably be able to find it
online but I'm like where's the one for
blondes at if it was just easily
available in the stores I would just see
it and be like oh yeah I want you but I
can't find the one for blondes but I
really liked it I do want to repurchase
it it'll probably have to be an online
thing but I hear so many people talk
about this and it's just a really good
product and then the last item i have is
from first aid beauty and if you have
seen like any of my skincare videos or
anything like that you know that i love
first day beauty and is their facial
radiance pads so it looks like this so I
got a little sample size of it I don't
know how many came in here 28 so what
they are our pads that you just rub over
your face and it says it's to exfoliate
tone and brighten i got this in like a
sample pack and blew through these
repurchased it a bigger size blew
through those and repurchased like the
Big Daddy that has like 60 or 80 pads in
there I freaking love these guys if you
have not tried per se beauty i highly
highly
Jess that you do and the number one
thing that i recommend from them is
these facial radiance pads they are
amazing like seriously they are bomb I
love force a beauty I've tried cleansers
from them I have a scrub from them in my
shower I have a vitamin spray mist that
I really like I mean I just think
they're an amazing brain especially if
you have sensitive skin because that is
like kind of food they are specifically
geared to but yes definitely the facial
radiance has a heart just a must for me
I will continue to repurchase these
