today's video is going to be an empties
video I have my little pink trash can
here and it's looking pretty fall so I
have a few empties to go over here with
you makeup skincare beauty all that good
stuff every time I finish up a product I
throw it into the little trash can and
then when I think it looks full enough
to do a video I create one for you guys
and I let you know what I thought of it
basically like giving a little review on
each product and letting you know if I
would repurchase it or not maybe i'll
call this like repurchase or regret i
feel like i've seen that one kind of
floating around and that could be a good
one like aimed towards empties because
yeah yeah maybe I'll do that repurchase
a regret so why don't we go ahead I
don't really remember how much stuff I
have in here but it looks like quite a
bit so why don't we go ahead and hop
into my trash went through this is like
teeth this is a crest ProHealth advanced
full right mouth treatment this is what
it looks like and it says it's extra
whitening and you know you're supposed
to see a whiter smile in seven days and
blah blah blah know that that didn't do
anything for me I do like having
mouthwash especially for like when I
feel like I just need like some sort of
pick me up in my mouth but I don't want
to a piece of gum are like full on brush
my teeth I'll throw some mouthwash in
there but I've tried so many different
mouthwashes that say they are helpful
with whitening because I tried anything
to help wipe my teeth and really nothing
is working so I mean what i buy this
again I don't know I probably just buy
whatever's on sale because I don't need
it for any of the fancy things that it
says it's going to do it's for when I
just need like a little for my mouth you
know is that thing since I the term it
could be so another item I have is a
body wash and this is from the brand
tone and it's their cocoa butter mango
splash body wash this is what it looks
like it's a pretty big guy honestly I
got this on sale when our kmart was
going out of business in the area and
these were on sale for like I don't know
a dollar or something so I picked one up
I took me a while to go through but
seriously like once I finished with it
and I went back to like my bath and body
works like exfoliating scrub and
shower it's such a huge difference so
will i repurchase this no i don't
necessarily regret it because it was on
sale and it works in a pinch but I like
my good stuff better so a face cleanser
that I used up is from first aid Beauty
you guys might have heard me talk about
force a beauty because I absolutely love
them but this is their pure skin face
cleanser this is what it looks like I
love for a safe beauty I would
definitely repurchase this I there I
don't feel like there's been our first
day beauty product that i've tried that
I haven't liked I love their whole line
they are kind of based more towards
sensitive skin which is me but I really
really like this cleanser I would
definitely repurchase it and if you
haven't checked out for say beauty yet I
suggest you do oderint how exciting so
the guys are curious of what deodorant
is that I where is from secrets they're
invisible salad I you typically do
they're like pH balance it has a little
sign over here saying pH balance this
one was in clean lavender normally I
think I do just like the powder or
whatever like the most regular of
regular deodorant deodorant scents are
that's the one I go to but for some
reason the day that I was shopping I was
like clean lavender that sounds good and
I didn't like did not like it I did not
like it I actually ended up purchasing
the regular one and then I just kind of
used these like off and on I finally
finished this one but I definitely would
stick to the powder 1 this is like this
is the only deodorant I we're basically
so in case you're wondering what the
owner and I where it's the secret
invisible solid I'm a hair care that I
used up that still has like some of my
hair attached to it you know no big deal
is from simply beautiful it's our marble
10 effects 10 and one hair treatment so
this is what it looks like it basically
it kind of reminds me of like the
miracle 10 spray as well because I've
used that and it's supposed to do things
like detangle reduce appearance of split
ends control frizzy Aidan brushing
replenishes lost moisture blah blah I
thought it was just fine i think this
was actually sent to me a while ago it
took me a while to get through it i do
think it's fine but i have used the 10
whatever that one is called the simply
10 miracle 10 is it miracle 10
remember it's a ye little yellow bottle
that you use for blondes I ended up
liking that one a lot more so would i
repurchase this one probably not but I
just have been to like that other one a
lot better so one sample that I went
through is from Clinique it's very
dramatically different moisturizing gel
this is what it looks like I feel like
samples are so hard to go over and like
actually review because I was only able
to use this twice did it feel like a
nice moisturizer yes can I like really
say much else about it no it's a
moisturizing gel like I have my
moisturizers that I like so i probably
wouldn't gravitate towards this one but
this still felt nice it's always nice
getting skincare samples especially to
like take to travel with you but i
probably wouldn't purchase this for
myself that i just really need to throw
away it still has a little bit left to
it but it really is not doing anything
anymore isn't from NYX and it's the
trays you'll a gel eyeliner so let me
see I think yeah I still have some left
but honestly I don't know like nothing
really happens like see the swatches
they're like it's a thing is just dried
up really bad and the last couple of
times that I've tried to use it on my
eyes that comes out like this like super
patchy and weird so unfortunately I
think it just got right up it's a really
really good pencil though so I probably
would repurchase this is a little bit
more expensive i think i paid like 11 or
12 dollar sport but it is really good
especially for the waterline so from
grace and stella i finally went through
this pack i was trying to like hang on
to them for as long as I could but this
is anti wrinkle and energizing I masks
this is a packaging look like again it's
from grace and Stella so these are I'm
ass you put them under your eyes it's
supposed to help the puff and kind of
just like brighten up the under eye area
I absolutely love these like once I
started getting down there I found
myself like really trying to wait till
us having that one like really really
rough morning where I really needed the
under eye masks because I was so sad for
them to run out these are really really
good eye masks I believe that I have a
discount code with Stella and grace it's
not an affiliate code but it's just a
code for you guys to save money i will
put that here and then I will
have it in the description box below
because I can't think what it is off the
top of my head but I really really would
recommend these and I definitely want to
get me some more so some more skin care
that I went through this is from origins
it's their clear improvement active
charcoal mask so this is what it looks
like it was just a little sample guy but
it took me a while to get through as
pretty impressed with how many
applications i was able to get out of
this I loved this stuff i would
definitely repurchase this i'm not sure
what the price of the full sizes but if
I ever even saw like another sample size
come up i would get it because it took
me a while to get through this little
guy I think it's great i really love
truncal mask a charcoal mas will always
be in my collection but i really really
like this so if you're looking for a
good chuckle mask check out origins well
that I went through is from boscia it's
the purifying cleansing gel so this is
one that I have actually tried it
samples up before and I really like it I
feel like I would purchase the full size
product based on the samples that I've
had now granite like I probably gone
through five samples or something of
these so I've been able to test it out
quite a few times and I just feel like
it would be a cleanser like it almost
kind of reminds me of the first eight
beauty wants a really nice cleanser that
left my skin and feeling very clean and
very smooth so I really do like the
bozhe line so this would be one that I
would definitely look into have some
more eyeliners here at three eyeliner
pens in here so another one is from NYX
this was there to timer pencil there was
kool on one side and more like the felt
tip liner on the other side so there was
the felt tip liner and then on the other
side you have the coal so I was really
intrigued by this and unfortunately this
product just did not work out I did like
the liner side but it ran out so quickly
I don't even feel like I got ten uses
out of the liner side before I
completely dried up and the cold just
absolutely did not work like it just
barely any product came off of it you
couldn't use it in the water line like
it just it was a mess so really I could
only use the felt tip side and again I
dried up super quickly and I think this
was a little bit more pricey too so this
was definitely a regret for me and I
will
be repurchasing that I went through is
from Maybelline this is their master
precise eyeliner if you guys watch my
tutorials or favorites videos or
whatever I talk about this eyeliner all
of the time I'm always recommending it I
absolutely love it it's from Maybelline
it is more affordable I already have
gone out and repurchase this once it
started to run out I ran out and got my
new one it sounds like I cannot not have
this in my collection it's i have it on
today it's just what I go to all of the
time when I just need like a good liquid
liner the tip is very precise but it's
also stiff so it helps to give you more
control when you're trying to create a
wing I just if you're looking for a good
liquid liner I definitely suggest this
one the last eyeliner that I have to
talk about is one that's not empty but I
just know that I need to throw it away
so I will never use it again it's from
Max Factor and it is the precise liquid
eyeliner I got this in a PR package from
Max Factor when they came out with like
a capsule collection with Pat McGrath
and I've been seeing it pop up at the
drug stores now I just saw a big display
of it and CVS the other day and I just
wanted to warn you guys away from this
eyeliner oh my goodness I just had the
worst worst experiences with this
eyeliner this is what the application
looks like like it's really thick and
flat on one side and then very thin flat
on the other side it's incredibly hard
to really do anything with this it's
really hard to make wing it's basically
impossible to make a wing but even the
application like it looks like you're
taking a Sharpie to your eyes it's not
flattering in any sort of the way this
was a huge regret not that i purchased
it myself but then i actually tried to
use it on my eyes like i normally don't
dislike a product so much but this one
was like a total makeup look runer and
then we are almost done so another
sample that I have in here is from tacha
is their pure one-step cleansing oil so
this is what it looks like was it being
oil i feel like i got like four uses out
of it or something crazy like that and
it was awesome i love cleansing oils i
use a lot of them to take off my makeup
because i just think they do amazing
things and
one was really really good I think I
know that tacha is pretty expensive but
like maybe if I ever saw this on sale I
would buy it but yeah it was it was so
awesome it takes up everything
waterproof liquid lipstick doesn't
matter it took it off I thought I have
is from Tarte and it's their lights
camera flashes this was like a little
mini guy as well and I have had this
finished for quite some time and it's
made me really sad because I thought
this was a really bomb mascara this is
what the one looks like I thought this
was fantastic I will definitely
repurchase this and I don't feel like I
see enough people talking about this
everyone talks about the lights camera
lashes which personally isn't my
favorite mascara and I think the flashes
is much better i really like this gold
packaging i don't know if this was like
some sort of limited edition something
because I'm just like why don't I see
more people talk about this I guess it's
not available anymore because I feel
like I need it back in my life I really
like this one I'm all looking into it if
I can find it I'm probably gonna
repurchase it so another thing from
Grayson Stella is their foot exfoliating
mask so they just had one foot mask in
here so obviously I went through it the
first time that I used it but this thing
was crazy this actually mentioned in my
August favorites video and I do show you
guys a photo of what my foot looks like
after I use the exfoliating mask warning
like it's a little bit gruesome I won't
put it in here if you want to see it
i'll link my August favorites video
below and i believe it was toward the
end that i mentioned this one and i
showed the photo but it was wild I have
tried foot exfoliating masks before and
they have not done anything this one
worked so well i definitely recommend it
was so insane to see my foot peeling the
way that it did it was crazy once again
i do have a coupon code with Grayson's
to ellis i'll leave it here it'll be in
the description box below but the eye
masks and the foot mask are two that i
highly recommend from this company my
final thing is a concealer this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer and I like
it kind of looks like i have some
product in there but really I don't it's
so hard to get anything on the
applicator I'm trying so hard so I have
had to decide to get rid of this one but
I've already gone to repurchase this
because the
concealer is my favorite I mentioned it
in my ride-or-die makeup tags will
obviously I've already gone out and
repurchased it because i just cannot not
have this concealer in my collection I
get the shade 10 light because I think
it's so beautiful for highlighting under
the under eyes as well it's just my
favorite concealer I don't know what
more I can say I've already repurchased
it it's amazing and my trash can is
empty it is waiting to get filled up
with some more empties I don't know for
sure how often I do empties videos maybe
like every six months or so because it
actually does take a while to go through
items so you can't do empties like every
single month that would just be so crazy
to me i mentioned like one product but i
will keep putting my empties into my
little trash can so i can share another
in phase with you very soon if you guys
do like this type of video and you like
seeing the products that I've actually
used up because that's my favorite part
of empties videos as seeing what people
are actually going through because I
think that it actually says a lot about
it like that's kind of the best review
you can give is when you actually gone
through an entire product and you can
review it or like a couple items in here
where they've just gone bad but you
still want to give you a review or you
just absolutely did not love them and
you want to throw them away but you want
to tell people how that happened because
thats that's me also but if you do find
these videos helpful or enjoyable to
watch please do leave that in the
comments below so that i know so that i
can keep filling up my trash can if you
guys want to keep seeing these videos
don't forget that i do have a very large
a fall giveaway going on right now so i

box below as well you do not want to
