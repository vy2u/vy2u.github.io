channel today's video I'm going to be
doing an empty and what I repurchase
that sort of thing this is only going to
be my second empties video I'm pretty
positive I don't have like a huge
boatload of items mostly because I am a
terrible going through things without
buying more things that's really bad I
need to be better at that but also I
just am having a really hard time
remembering to keep my empties
especially samples I do have a few
samples to show in here as well but I'm
just always throwing them away so I
think I get more accustomed to doing the
empties videos I'll start being better
at remembering but I'm still not the
greatest at it but yeah if you would
like to see a few of my empty products
and get my opinions on if I would
repurchase them please keep watching I
think I actually had more samples than I
thought I realized my bag was a little
bit fuller than I thought
everything's falling out my laughs I
wish I had a table well okay so the
first sample that I got is this dr.
Brandt pore dermabrasion pore perfecting
exfoliator little guy from Sephora I did
like this I probably got like three uses
out of it it wasn't just like a one-time
use thing I think I got a feel uses what
I will say about this is that I liked it
and I felt like it really was
exfoliating my skin the only problem
with that is that I have very sensitive
skin and this kind of felt like raw to
me like when I was rubbing it on my skin
I literally was like wincing like oh
okay that kind of hurts and then when I
would wash it off my face was pretty red
so I mean I only don't use it at night
because I feel like that's the time that
I usually exfoliate so it wasn't a big
deal and I'd usually put like a sleeping
cream on and then just go to bed and
everything would be fine but it's not
something that I could use like every
night or maybe even like on a weekly
basis because it like hurt my skin so
much but maybe if you don't have
sensitive skin and you really like deep
exfoliating it seemed to work pretty
good would I repurchase this I don't
know I probably would get
more sample sizes of it but I don't
think I would be able to go through a
full size product at a decent pace so
probably not a full size but I pick up
another sample another sample I got from
Sephora is from bite Beauty and it was
their agave lip masks and these came
like in three different like shades or
whatnot so that's kind of like what it
looked like and then I would like press
the lips and the product would come out
the top I don't know if that's how you
were supposed to do it but that's how I
did it so that worked out for me but
I've only got like two or three uses out
of each color so there was three colors
so it wasn't bad I really liked it oh it
came in champagne natural and smashed
and it says apply this hydrating lip
mask day or night for soft supple lips I
will say that I really did like it I've
heard a lot of a lot of good things
about these lip masks and so when I saw
that it was a sample on Sephora I was
like you know what I'm gonna try that
they are very very hydrating and almost
like very thick and I really liked them
I
I like having lip masks or lip scrubs
especially during the winter time you
need that but also because I wear liquid
lipstick so much that I feel like when I
take them off or before I apply them
like I need a good mask or good scrub
going on and I really did like these I
don't know if I would need a full-size
of them but I also don't know what the
full size would cost but I know I just
place an order with Sephora and I got
another sample of these because I was
like yeah I like those another sample I
got is from Korres and it was their
Greek yoghurt foaming cream cleanser
this with a little sample guy looked
like I think I got two uses out of these
I used it at night and then also the
next morning I will say that I liked it
it was very like what am I it was very
like thick and creamy which I liked a
lot but it also like foamed at the same
time it was kind of like different from
other things that I've experienced but I
will say that it almost kind of did
irritate my skin a little bit
I do have sensitive skin like I said and
I noticed like it wasn't gritty or
anything
as an exfoliator it definitely was more
unlike the cleanser side but it wasn't
gentle on my skin and it kind of left
especially like my cheek area like right
here it left it pretty Rud and I was
kind of surprised at that again I only
used it twice so those are just like
what I experienced both times I would
repurchase a full-size of it just
because if something's gonna irritate my
skin then I'm probably not gonna
repurchase the full size but I'm glad I
was able to try it out I do hear a lot
of good things about it another sample
that I got is from nude it's their Omega
treatment rescue oil and I guess that's
probably what the full-size would look
like it just came in like this little
guy out here I got quite a few uses out
of it because it's just oil but it says
rescue scandal with this ultra Shiro
ultra sheer facial treatment oil this
day and night don't like press two to
three drops on the cleanse to face a
neck so I assume the full-size has this
little dropper there with it that you
would use cleansing oils and facial oils
are like totally hot right now everyone
wants them everyone's using them all the
companies are coming out with the high
ends coming out with them drugstores
coming out with them
everyone wants cleansing oils I'm all
about cleansing oils I use them every
single day I love the one from
Neutrogena just comes in a blue bottle I
use it pretty much daily love cleansing
oils I really liked this this is another
one that I saw was still first sample at
Sephora and I picked another enough
because I really liked it do I need the
full size again I would have to look at
the price but because I love the
Neutrogena one so much I don't know if I
would need it but I really am all about
oil right now so this could definitely
be a repurchase I think this is my last
sample and it was the benefit Air Patrol
and it is their like BB cream eyelid
primer is what they call it and it just
came in like this little guy I love this
this is another one when I placed an
order on Sephora they this was still a
sample and I picked up another staple
because I love it but I will purchase a
full-size of
I have to have it I just placed an order
for Sephora the other night and I almost
got it but I think I actually have two
more samples of these and I could
probably get like two or three uses out
of each one and I will say that I'm not
a big eyelid primer girl and what I mean
by that is I don't have like a specific
eyelid primer products I usually just
use my concealer like my instant Avery
whined I put it before I put my eye
makeup on I put it around my eyes I put
it on my eyelids I buff it all out and
that's what I use is my primer and it
works really well for me but I really
really liked this primer not only
because I think it did to go junk
priming your eyes and I think it did a
good job
having your makeup last but also it's
supposed to be like a color corrector
for your eyelid so if you have dark
eyelids if you have any like a sort of
spots on your eyelids it's supposed to
be able to color correct them so your
eyelids are all one color so it's a good
base for when you actually start your
shadows and it did it really did that
for me and it just it made it it made
placing the shadows so much easier I
thought the color showed up so well and
I thought it stayed so well so I am
reaching for my samples when I know like
I'm doing my makeup early and I'm going
out all night long or if I just know
it's gonna be a long night and I want my
makeup to stay I used up my Garnier
moisture rescue refreshing gel cream it
comes in this little black bottle and I
use it up all of it all of it the night
before I was like reaching my fingers in
there like is there any more left
there's not it's all gone I think I have
talked about this moisturizer on my
channel before I absolutely love it I
will definitely be repurchasing this I'm
kind of sad that I don't have one right
now I need to get out and buy one this
is my favorite moisturizer it comes in
green which was this one and it also
comes in like a pink cream I absolutely
love it it's so lightweight it's still
refreshing on the skin I've been using
this moisturizer for years and years and
it will always be my collection gotta
get another one
just ran out last night I was like no
but it's so good I love it Garnier it's
affordable it's like my favorite
moisturizer so I went through
my cleansing wipes and these are from
Neutrogena it's their oil-free pink
grapefruit cleansing wipes it looks like
this in the package I did not like these
at all I usually use like the blue
Neutrogena Neutrogena wipes just like
their regular makeup removing wipes I
don't know but for some reason I thought
I'd get the pink grapefruit ones because
I have a bunch of the pink grapefruit
and their skin care lines like their
cleansers and exfoliators so for some
reason I thought to get this one and we
did not get along and I don't know if
it's because of the scent or what it is
but especially when I would use them to
take off my eye makeup it would irritate
my eyes so bad my eyes would be red I
remember the first time using one and I
went right in on my eyelids and it's
just like the scent and whatever
ingredients they have to use to make it
the pink grapefruit like seeped into my
eyes made them bloodshot they hurt so
bad they were so itchy
I mean for the rest of my face it's fine
but a lot of times if I'm traveling and
I'm bringing my wipes it's because I
don't want to also pack my separate
makeup remover pads I don't want to
bring my liquid along and my you know
like cotton balls or puffs over never
dust that you're removing eye makeup I
just want to get it all in one with this
but I was not able to use these on my
eyes I could only use them on my face
because they would irritate my eyes so
badly so it was getting to a point where
usually I would only use these when
traveling or like if I have a really
late night I come home and I just like
can't go through my whole skincare
routine I just know I need to get my
makeup off I'll use a makeup remover
wipe but it was to the point where I was
just using him to use them like I have a
little bit of fallout from doing my
makeup and I'm like oh let me grab that
makeup remover pad because I just wanted
to go through them so the pink
grapefruit ones did not get along with
I'll just be going back to the regular
Neutrogena makeup remover wipes but
speaking of the Neutrogena pink
grapefruit I did have their creamy
cleanser and I went through this and we
got along very well I do like the pink
grapefruit line - the pads or the wipes
I do have the cleanser in my
right now and I use it every time that I
shower I really like it I did really
really like the cream cleanser it was so
light on the skin it smelled good it was
easy to apply and left my face feeling
so fresh it took me a while to get
through this I think I purchased it like
before the summer started so it took me
a while to get there but I really did
like it would I repurchase it yeah I
sure would I liked it a lot and I'm
almost out of the exfoliator as well
I'll probably repurchase that for my
shower too so speaking of showers I have
something like super random but I just
wanted to mention it and it is a razor
and I believe it's like the Schick
intuition razor this is what it looks
like it's just less like bagel guy so
the story behind this is that months ago
I was at the store I needed to buy
razors and I bought the wrong razors and
I bought them for this intuition razor
instead of do I have like the Venus
razor I think is what I normally have
bought the wrong razors and I was like
you know what I've used that razor
forever maybe I'll just go out and buy
this like intuition razor so I can use
like the refillable blades so I went out
and I bought this and oh my gosh I did
not know how bad razors could be we did
not get along at all and the reason why
I thought I would mention in this video
because I was getting ready to just
throw this away I finally just went out
and you know I bought the regular
refillables that I would use but then I
was watching Jam Beauty 89 Jessica and
she mentioned this razor and how bad it
is and I was like girl me too oh my gosh
that's so crazy
like I don't feel like we talked about
razors a lot but I'm like okay I was
really glad that she said something
because I thought I was like going crazy
I thought maybe I forgot how to shave my
legs like I didn't know what was going
on but I think it's because if you can
tell by the hole here like the razors
are so big and I think they just have
too much of the you know like the soap
around it that's supposed to like be
moisturizing and make you not cut
yourself I think there was too much of
that
but it also would just fall apart after
one use all of that soap and stuff would
be absolutely gone but it was like the
racers were too small to actually shave
your legs so I would get out of the
shower and I'd be putting lotion on and
I'm like oh good
looks like I didn't shave my legs at all
that's fabulous so yeah I don't know I
guess I'm just happy to know that I
wasn't the only one that had the same
experience with it so if you guys have
let me know because I thought I was
going crazy for a while but yeah the
Schick intuition razor not so hot I just
have two hair care items to talk about
one is from bio Lodge it is their
hydrating shampoo it was a pretty decent
sized bottle of it it took me forever to
get throughout so proud when I finally
got through it because I feel like I've
had it in my shower forever I love by
lash I've been using them for years I
like to have a hydrating shampoo in my
shower it says that nourishes drive
stressed hair especially in the winter
time for me like I need something
hydrating in my shower love I allows
love the way it smells it's a pretty
decent price and I think I could get
these at like Ulta and Target so would I
repurchase this yes I sure would I think
I have the matching conditioner in my
shower right now actually and then I
have a conditioner from Kendra this was
their volumizing conditioner so though
it has like the standard standard Kendra
style I have the shampoo is still in my
shower I haven't gone through the full
volumizing shampoo yet I really really
liked these camera products I think I
did a haircare video like way back in
the day when I first started you know
like in May not even a year ago but I
really enjoyed these these were a
recommendation from a hair stylist that
I actually met on a vacation and you
know she said that you know Kendra is a
little bit more expensive but it also
really does work and I agree with that I
really enjoyed my experience with Kendra
this was my first Kendra products that I
purchased and I ended up buying a dry
shampoo from them and I think I have a
Hair Spray from them as well and I think
I probably would repurchase these for
some reason I'm getting sent a lot of
shampoos and conditioners lately I don't
know what it is but I have kind of a lot
to get through but would I go back to
Kendra yeah I sure would so those are
all my empty I hope you guys enjoyed
this video like I said I think it's
thought my only I think it's only the
second empties video that I have done
but I hope you guys enjoyed it I'll try
to keep remembering to save my empties
because empties are some of like my
favorite videos to watch because I'd
like to see what people are getting them
through because I think that's a big
deal especially in like the makeup and
beauty community I know how hard it is
to get through something I just hit pan
the other day on like a foundation
powder and I was like oh my god I should
be I'm like it was like the most
exciting day of are like when you
realize you are actually using products
that you spent your hard-earned money on
but I will try to be better at saving
them so like I said I love watching
other people's videos I like to know
what worked for them what didn't work
for them if they would repurchase them
because that's also a big deal because
there's always so many new things coming
out and so many new exciting different
things from all these different
companies so it's like if you know
something is like their tried-and-true
you know what it is like for mine out of
this entire line I mean for sure my
tried and true is that Garnier
moisturizer I always have one I have to
go buy one I'm devastated that I ran out
without having a backup my that's like
my one if I had to like pick one
favorite out of this empties video it
would be that moisturizer I just we go
way back and we're good friends we have
I hope you guys enjoyed this video
please do give it a thumbs up if you did
make sure to subscribe before you go and
I will check back in with you soon with
a new video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
