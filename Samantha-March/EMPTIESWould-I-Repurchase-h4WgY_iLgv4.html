today's video is going to be my very
first empties video so I see a lot of
these empties videos on YouTube people
are sharing like the makeup and beauty
products that they have used up and then
they just kind of give their
recommendations you know would they
repurchase this again I think these are
really interesting because to me it's
interesting to see what products people
are using instead of just buying them
using them once or twice and being like
it would distantly work out because I
have a like whole makeup collection of
products that I bought and I just ended
up hating and never using again but it's
nice to see the products that we
actually get through because it can be
kind of hard to get through some of
these so I kept forgetting and kept
forgetting to share my or to keep my
empties and I finally have been
remembering to do it so I have a decent
amount to share with you today so if you
would like to see my first empties video
and items that I would or would not
repurchase please keep away so jumping
in first I have the Guarnere clean
soothing makeup removing cleansing
towelettes and i think i have like one
more maybe two left in here but i
already have a new pack purchase I mean
I go through these all the time if
there's ever any sort of sales like
sometimes target has like by three and
get a five dollar gift card on like yeah
I'm gonna buy three because I go through
them so much whenever I travel this is
what I take with me it's so easy they're
so accessible you know some nights
there's nights that I come home maybe I
got home late and I just don't feel like
doing my full makeup removing routine
but I don't want to sleep in my makeup
because he wants to do that I grab these
absolutely loved and will definitely
repurchase I do like the garden a brand
i buy from them a lot I just bought they
have a few different ones i think i just
bought the pink package at target but
love them and then keeping on the makeup
removing a trend I have these all may
lash care gentle eye makeup remover pads
so that is what the bottle looks like
this is completely empty I actually
threw it in my garbage last night and
then as
I was going through my products to grab
today to bring down to do this video I
was like no but it was sitting right on
top and I was like taking it up taking
it out just don't tell me but now the
all my eye makeup remover they are just
like a small pad there a moistened towel
and I just use them for my eye makeup I
I mean I guess you could use them for
your full face but it's literally just
like one round pad and I use one and I
can usually get both eyes unless I have
a lot of mascara on a lot of black
eyeliner on then I need to use one for
each eye but I love them again if I ever
see there's any specials where you can
buy multiples these are the ones i buy
they do have green I think they have
purple and maybe even like blue as well
I love all of them I don't discriminate
i don't buy one more than the other just
love them all and it's all my it's
pretty affordable and you can find it at
the drugstore then I have a few products
from Maybelline the first one is the
Maybelline instant age rewind it's the
concealer and this one is I mean it's
not totally empty yet but it's getting
there like I have to really find myself
like pressing into it but I have to get
this one I mean this I can't go without
this in my collection the shade i have
is 215 fairlight I absolutely love this
I recommend this to everybody if anyone
asks for a concealer this is what I go
for it definitely does cover your dark
circles but it also brightens up your
under-eye I use it even sometimes
there's like a primer I'll just put it
all over my eye all over my eyelid buff
it into my skin use it as a shadow
primer I can't say enough good things
about it it's Maybelline it's affordable
I need this another one that I have from
Maybelline is the Maybelline Dream fresh
BB cream that's what that packaging
looks like it's the eight and one beauty
balm skin Perfector and it's the medium
sheer tint i bought this like a while
ago and it took me some time to get
through but I love BB creams I always
have a couple BB creams on hand I have a
few from all might as well um would i
repurchase this i I don't know that this
is like my holy
rail BB cream i don't think i have a
Holy Grail BB cream to be honest with
you I know that Maybelline has come out
with a few newer BB creams I've seen the
packaging I was just that target today
and I saw they have like a blue
packaging one is kind of like a
Bluegreen you know maybe if there was
some sort of special you know I have the
target cartwheel app maybe if something
was on cartwheel that would probably
decide which one I'm going to repurchase
but really good i mean if you want a BB
cream I thought this one did the job
really well and then the last one that I
have from Maybelline is the definer lash
mascara and I really like this mascara
it took me a long time to go through
because I don't find myself wearing
mascara like on a daily basis because I
work from home so I don't need to do my
makeup everyday and that sort of thing
and mascara I think it's the most
annoying thing in the world to take off
at the end of the night so if I'm not
going anywhere i'm not putting mascara
on because i don't want to take it off
but i found myself really loving this
mascara and it is so i just need to
throw it away that's what the one looks
like the one is very flexible if you can
see like it's very flexible so you can
really get into all your lashes i do
think it does a good job at doing what
it says defining your lashes i really
liked it i did mention i think i used
this in my five-minute drugstore makeup
tutorial i think this was the mascara
that I used and I mentioned that they
also have to find a line in their
eyeliner and I don't like it at all like
that's the product that's in my drawer
of like makeup that I don't ever use
because I just did not like it but the
mascara i really liked and I also have a
hairspray that yeah I just need to throw
this away but this is the kenra it's
just like the travel size hairspray it
says it's super hold finishing spray
number 25 it's got the pink ribbon on
there this is what i always take I'd
like to have a travel size hairspray of
course for when I travel I have like
really big like extra large hair sprays
that I keep at my house and of course I
don't want to take them what I'm
traveling so this is what I take what I
repurchases
then I would probably just want any sort
of good travel sized hairspray then my
final two thinks I have a gel eyeliner
and this is the Revlon Colorstay and
this actually has like no it has less
than I thought it was I mean there's
still some product in there but it's
kind of like in this pan if you guys can
see that pan and it's I mean it's pretty
much it's gone it's pretty dried out um
I liked this this was my first gel
eyeliner that I bought when gel eyeliner
start to become really popular this was
the first one that I gravitated to
because I liked that it came with its
own little brush like you see how that
has its own little brush and of course I
used it a lot so it's really gross um
once I bought an actual eyeliner brush
from i bought the sigma eyeliner brush
then I started to only use that one and
stopped using that but i liked it i just
i found it pretty difficult to get the
product out because of the way the pan
is set up um i have the maybelline gel
eyeliner and it's just it's really easy
the product isn't far down in there it's
very easy to pick up the product so that
was probably my biggest complaint about
this would i repurchase this probably
not because i like the Maybelline I've
also heard really good things about the
morphe gel eyeliner and i think i'm
getting ready to put in a more feet
order for a bunch of brushes and i'm
going to try that route again really
just the the packaging just didn't work
out for me and then my final product to
share with you and you guys I am so
pumped if you have been watching my
videos for a while I mean I've only been
on here since like april but i have
talked so much about the babe lash
eyelash serum i mean i don't know how
many videos that I've mentioned it but
it is an eyelash serum that you put
that's what it looks like sorry my phone
is buzzing you put it along your top
line and it's supposed to help your
eyelashes grow it definitely works I
believe that you do need I see I've seen
it on amazon and i'm a
little worried to order it on amazon
because i don't know is that the real
deal I don't know because my best friend
is um she has a recitation license and
she needs her license to purchase it at
a beauty store so I've asked her if she
could go pick me up another one because
I'm out and I'm really bummed out about
it and then again you know I did see
them on Amazon I just don't know if
they're like the real legit thing so I
would rather purchase what I know works
for me and that's what she buys at the
beauty store but I absolutely love this
up I totally think it works I've gotten
so many compliments on my eyelashes I've
cut way back in buying fake eyelashes
because this really did make my
eyelashes grow I am totally one hundred
percent out of this and I'm like please
go buy me some more okay so that was my
first empties video hopefully I kept
this one short and sweet I didn't have a
whole lot of products to talk about but
i will keep saving my empty products as
i use some up I don't know how often
i'll be able to do empties videos
because of course i want to have you
know at least like five products to be
able to tell you about so if i run out
of like one tube of eyeliner I'm going
to wait until I have a few more that I
can share but hopefully every couple
months i have an empties to share with
you if you guys like this video idea if
you want to see my empty products and
know if I would repurchase please do
give this video a thumbs up or comment
below and let me know if you guys do
then I will make sure that i put that on
my schedule so I can do it every few
months for you if you do have any other
video recommendations for me please
again just comment below and let me know
someone just commented and asked for
like a holiday makeup tutorial or even
like a Christmas or family card picture
tutorial and I think that's a really
good idea so I put that down I
definitely want to do that someone did
mention Halloween honestly so I'm not a
trained makeup artists oh I'm not
certified I don't really know what
halloween tutorial I would do I haven't
dressed up as anything crazy these past
few years I don't have any halloween
makeup around so I need to think about
that one a little bit more to see if
there's anything that I could figure out
to do for you guys
but if not I do plan on doing definitely
a holiday look and also the Christmas
card look you know such as some sort of
like family appropriate but good for
pitchers I definitely plan on doing that
tutorial as well if there's anything
else you'd like to see just let me know
please do subscribe before you go and I
will catch you in my next video thanks
