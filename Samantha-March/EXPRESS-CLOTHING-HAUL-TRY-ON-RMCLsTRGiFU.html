today's video is going to be a new
clothing haul and a Tryon video with
Express which I am so excited about
Express has been one of my favorite
stores for many many many years so
actually magical inks reach out to me
and asked if I wanted to do this video
if you are not familiar with magic links
where you can create affiliate links and
that way if someone clicks on your link
and buys a product you get a part of a
commission for that sale I've been using
magic links for over a year now and I
really enjoy the website I recommend
them all of the time and also my website
especially if you are a youtuber or a
blogger or things like that because it
is a way to be able to earn money but
they did reach out to me and asked if I
wanted to make this video with Express
it's not a sponsored video and that I'm
getting paid to make this video but I
did get sent these items and I graded to
make this video in exchange for the
items that I was receiving so a big
thank you to both magical links for
reaching out to me and also Express for
sending me these items like I said I've
been wearing Express for the longest
time I used to save of my money so much
when I was in my early college days so I
could buy just a few pieces and Express
because I just really loved their
quality of clothing one thing I'll say
about Express is that sometimes they can
have higher prices for items but they
also run a lot of really good sales
which is awesome but they have really
quality pieces so I knew especially back
in my college days when I was purchasing
an item that I would save up money for
like I still have so many of those items
in my closet today because they just
last for a really long time so they're
those like qualities staple pieces that
you can have in your closet so I'm
excited to show you the items that I
picked out for today's video I should
also have a discount code I think it's
gonna be for 15% off on the Express
website it's not going to be an
affiliate code it's just a discount code
for you
I will have that listed on the screen
and then also in the description box
down below and Express also does have a
new rewards program called Express next
if you sign up it's just a free rewards
program but you would earn points when
you do make purchases and then you can
redeem those points in for money off
your orders so just fantastic I always
love rewards programs but I'm excited to
show you the pieces that I got so why
don't we go ahead and get started first
item that I have here is the
so leafless a shirt here it does have it
two pockets on the side and then it does
also have a collar I really like this
fabric because it's very lightweight and
very breathable so it'll be really nice
coming into the warmer months but I just
really like the way that this looked on
I did get it in an extra small one thing
because I have shopped out expressed for
a very long time I know that their sizes
kind of run a bit bigger especially when
it does comes to tops I typically wear a
small but in Express I wear almost an
extra small in everything so that's just
something to keep in mind because even
though this is an extra small I feel
like I have room in it it's nice and
long on me as well and I just really
enjoyed the quality of this shirt so
again I got an extra small and this is a
forty nine ninety I have the tags on
everything still so I could be setting
it in this video I just got my package
in and I will also be inserting clips of
me trying everything on so you can see
how they fit on me but this is just a
really nice kind of more like
professional shirt but I think that it
would pair well you know with a nice
pair of pants or even like a nicer pair
of shorts to for the summer so I really
enjoyed that shirt I have kind of a gray
sweater from the 111 line so this is
what the sweater looks like again it's
really like lightweight breathable it is
a bit sheer um you'll be able to see in
the Tran Clips it's a bit sheer so you
can wear a cami underneath or you know
it's not like absolutely see-through to
are like you need to wear something
underneath but it is just a bit sheer
but I really like this kind of like gray
gunmetal color it has the short sleeves
here and it just fits like it's not like
a slouchy fit but it's not really like
form-fitting so again I think this could
be a really good work option as well if
you go into the office again I got mine
in a size extra small and this one is a
29 90 and then I got I believe this is
called a boyfriend shirt and I'm just
I'm really into this right now yes it
doesn't says it right here on the tag so
I really enjoyed this light blue color
you'll actually see some more of it as
well but this is a long sleeve shirt and
again it is pretty sheer not completely
see-through but I'm you might want to
wear like if you are wearing it to work
it would probably be good if you wore
something underneath it but it's just
kind of like you know when you hear a
boyfriend you kind of think of a more
like relaxed
type of fit and that's what
one reminds me up it's just a really
nice like casual button-down shirt again
I'm really loving this blue color here I
like the long sleeves but again I like
how lightweight and breathable it is
you're gonna see that a lot but
especially going into the summer months
I like this option whereas we're
transitioning into warmer months it
could be nice to wear was shorts you
know kind of pair the long sleeves with
the shorts type of thing I just really
like the way that this one fits again
this is an extra small and this one
retailed at 450 990 of course everything
will also be linked out down below and
I'll put it in the order that I'm trying
everything on so next up I have a couple
pair of pants to talk about this first
one here is the columnist pants these
are about mid rise so they're not super
low on the hips but they aren't a total
high rise they stop at about the ankle
and then they get skinnier here at the
end I really like these pants and again
I feel like these could be really cute
in a corporate setting especially paired
with you know especially the first shirt
that I showed I think that that would be
a nice like good summer outfit perhaps
and I do like these also because the
waist has a little bit of a stretch to
them nothing like super super stretchy
but just a nice nice bit of a stretch
within the waist so it doesn't feel too
constricting I got my Nana size too
regular
so again one good thing about Express is
that you can kind of choose the length
for your pants as well most pants do
have them so I have a two regular I am a
55 so I don't feel like I particularly
need the shorts and I don't need the
lungs either and the two hours fit
really well for me I think this would be
really good paired with like a pair of
nude pumps or something that's kind of
the outfit that I have in mind I am
speaking at a writers conference in May
and I am planning on wearing these pants
one day and I might pair it with that
first shirt as well and then a pair of
nude pumps is kind of an idea I have to
wear at that conference but I really
like these I love this color I love the
Navy color I like the fit of them and I
like that where they hit at the ankles
as well and the twos were perfect for me
so these are in olive which I really
enjoy
this color a lot they are high waisted
which I like because I do prefer
high-waisted jeans so I really like that
these were high waisted again they hit
at the ankle but I thought it was really
cute because they actually have this
kind of like belt sash that you can tie
you can tie it in the front I kind of
tie it more off to the side but again I
think that these are really cute nice
like professional pants again I think
that they would pair well with either
like black or nude pumps and maybe with
like a white or a lighter color top
again I'm thinking about bringing these
to the writers conference as well and I
do have to speak two different days so
I'm thinking of maybe wearing these with
a kind of like nicer white shirt and
then heels again for the second day but
I love the color of these and I love
that sash detail which you'll see again
and another piece but I thought that
these fit really well again I got the
size too regular again they fit really
nice on the hips and then I like the
length of them also I will say that I
think that these pants are gonna be
pretty popular though because I actually
tried to order a second pair of them in
like a really pretty light pink pastel
color and by the time I went to order it
like place my order it sold out the
massage I was really sad about that but
again I got the two are and these are 69
and 94 at the owl of high waisted pants
so if I have another tank top here and
once I thought I just knew I had to have
it again this is from the 111 line it's
a muscle tank so a sleeveless a tank
here and it has cactus on it I went to
Arizona recently at for my birthday trip
with my husband and friends and we
really want to get a little cactus plant
but we haven't been able to find one
around here which is a bummer I wish we
could have got one there and brought it
home but we didn't but when I saw this
shirt I was like obviously I have to get
the shirt so this one I got an extra
small as well and it is a 2990 again
lightweight breathable and pretty long
on me it's not super long but it's not
short it's not a crop by any means or
anything like that the back is plain and
then you have the cactus on the front so
I thought that was super cute I also got
a pair of faux leather leggings I do not
have any of these faux leather leggings
and I actually see people out and about
quite a bit with them on has kind of
been like I want to pair those so I just
picked up these pretty basic faux
leather leggings I got mine in a size
small and these ran for 49 nine
but I do like the way they fit did they
come all the way down it said the ankle
as well I mean they are the faux leather
so they fit very very form-fitting on
the body I would say the only thing that
I wish they were said that I wish that
they were high-waisted there they're
about mid rise I would say again and I
think it would be really nice if they
were just a little bit higher and just
kept everything in I will say that they
actually don't have a ton of stretch to
them if I pull really hard I can stretch
them and they just kind of seem to fit
like they just they don't fit as nice as
the other pants that I was talking about
from Express I don't feel like I would
need an extra small though I feel like
that would be too tight and I don't feel
like a medium would work either but I
just feel like they don't fit the best
on my hips they're just a little bit
loose I guess so but other than that as
long as I don't wear like a crop top
with them if I wear something a little
bit longer I think that I'll still be
able to get away with them like the way
that they look on my body I just wish
the fit was just a little bit better but
I'm excited to have these in my
collection of one and a pair for a while
but next time I have a shirt that was
actually wearing in a video earlier this
week when I was talking about new
palette releases and reviews so it is
this blue blouse right here and it has
these two vertical up black stripes and
then in the back it does zip up a little
bit you'll see in the Tran clips I film
during the day some by myself and I have
not taught areas how to work a zipper
yet that's my dog I'm gonna don't work
on that one day she's gonna get it for
me so I can't actually zip it if I'm by
myself but again I just really like this
color that's kind of baby blue sky blue
color I thought was really pretty it's
very high up on the neck as well and I
like the little sleeves I got a lot of
compliments in that video on this shirt
and I got it an extra small and it runs
for 4990 the only thing I'll say about
it is when I first put it on it kind of
reminded me of like nurse scrubs and I'm
not sure if it's the color that's doing
that or just that it's higher up or the
material I'm not really sure what's
going on but even when my husband came
home that night that I was wearing it I
was like does this remind you of scrubs
and he said yeah that's like
okay that's what I thought but it
actually did look cute paired with the
faux leather likings or in the photo
unexpressed the gal was wearing it with
like longer white shorts and I thought
that that looked pretty so I think if
you pair it nicely with bottoms I think
it won't look as nurse issue because
that's not necessarily the look that I'm
going for but I still really like this
color I like the fit again loose and
lightweight nothing too tight or
anything like that and then nice and
long on the body as well so I thought
that blouse was really cute I also
picked up a pair of shorts I'm not a big
shorts wearer but there are times in the
summer here where it does hit 100 and
the humidity is really high in wearing
pants outside is just not the brightest
move so I don't wear shorts every once
well I don't necessarily love my legs or
the back of my legs but that's okay I
still wear shorts sometimes and I saw
that these were high-waisted jeans
shorts and I thought that they could be
pretty cute you can see that they're
pretty frayed as well and then they just
have button details um that go up so
these are called the vintage high-rise
of shorty and I got a size two again
these fit me really well and I really
like the way that they look especially
on the booty I feel like they might make
the butt look pretty nice I like that
they are high-waisted especially because
I do wear a lot of crop tops especially
in the summer are like shorter shirts
and things like that so I like that
these are high-waisted they're
definitely short in the back especially
if I do make them all the way up to my
belly button they do get pretty short in
the back but not where like my butts
hanging out type of thing but you can
also kind of wear them a little bit
lower on the hips and then they're
obviously longer on the thigh area so I
really do like these I'll see I can see
myself wearing these quite a bit this
summer and I think they fit really well
except I have a tank top here and I mean
this is just such a basic piece but I
have a feeling I should be wearing those
a ton in the summer I did pair it with
the jean shorts in the Tryon clips and I
loved it with the jean shorts and I've
also tried it on with the navy pants and
I also really liked that outfit
especially if you like run a wire to
work you could put like a blazer over it
I have a white blazer that I think would
be really cute with that outfit as well
so again it's just a basic tank top it
does have one pocket here but it's super
super comfortable and lightweight
breathable
once again it's from the 111 line I got
that extra small and it's a 29 and 90 so
again I think just one of the
like basic staples though for your
closet I again I'm really attracted to
this light blue color but I'd like to
get more pieces of this tank top I just
really like the way it fit it's not too
tight but it's still like ish
form-fitting at the same time so I
really like this one and then I have a
pair of shorts here these are the ones
that I was saying that was similar to
the olive pants because they do have
this belt so you can tie it in a sash
you'll see in the video I do have it
tied
I like these shorts because they're a
little bit longer they do is zip on the
side and then you can do what you please
what the belt so I like it because they
are longer just to give them someone who
I don't love my legs and so when I'm
wearing shorts I do like something to be
a little bit longer so I do like these
they don't fit the best around the waist
though I got the size two again I'm
pretty sure these are high rise yes I
got the size two
I like that they are higher up on the
waist but they're also just a little bit
too big I would say so again I know that
Express does run bigger but I feel like
2 is the best option for me so I really
just kind of tighten the belt when I've
been wearing these the only thing that I
was disappointed about is on the website
these are listed as red and in the photo
they look red and they're actually more
of like a burnt orange color so I'm a
little bit disappointed about the
coloring on these because I thought red
would be cool like if we make it to
Wrigley Field for a Cubs game would be
cute to wear red shorts with my blue cub
shirt or like fourth of July it can be
cute for a 4th of July outfit so I'm a
little disappointed that they're more
orange than anything again these just
run a little bit big on me but I like
the sash and I like that they were
longer and I thought those were cute and
then finally the last item that I have
here is a dress this is one that I was a
little bit unsure about when I pulled it
out since like that is gonna be so long
on me it is just a little bit long on me
but if I wear it not even with heels but
even just something looks like a little
bit of like a platform a little bit of a
boost I don't mind the length on it so
it has the halter and neck here and then
it's again it's very long goes all the
way to the floor it does have a slit in
it and on the website it looked like the
slit was more like towards the center of
the leg and more high up so I was a
little concerned about that but it's
actually more off to the side and it
starts fairly far down so I feel like
this is a
appropriate dress for again you know
maybe like a family wedding are things
like that we have quite a bit coming up
this summer and I can see myself wearing
this dress to one of them because I feel
like it's an appropriate length I feel
like the splits appropriate it is a
halter neck and the only thing I'll say
is that I feel like it fits a little
like not the best up here at the chest
area like I wish this lining for the
chest was either either higher or
shorter I'm not I'm not sure I just feel
like it kind of hits at an awkward angle
for me but again I like the way that it
fit I like the length of it and I just
think it's so perfect for summer the
sunshine is actually out today which is
very exciting
maybe spring is actually here this one
is a $69.99 did to go with a small for
this one I could have made the extra
small work but the small works pretty
good for me so after that dress that is
the final piece for this express the
