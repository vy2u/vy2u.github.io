today's video is going to be another fab
or fail video I have a couple products
here that I have either bought or been
sent that I've been testing out to
review for you guys so that is basically
just all this video is going to be I'm
going to be giving you my thoughts on
these products if I would suggest them
and who I would recommend them for and
that sort of thing so we have some
Maybelline pixi by Petra my makeup brush
that benefit Real Techniques so why
don't we go ahead and hop into it have
here is probably one that was most
recommended to rebukes a lot of people
have been curious about this one this
was actually sent to me in a PR package
from benefit which I was super grateful
for because I'd never tried this product
out it is the they're real push-up liner
so this is what it looks like I was
really excited to try it but I hadn't
really heard a lot about it when someone
I would see someone using it or talk
about using it but nothing really liked
to in-depth so I was excited when I got
it I don't like this product I don't I
don't like this at all okay so i just
took the cap off and then this is what
mine looks like right now so my issue
with this is that it doesn't work and i
don't know if maybe i just got a bad one
but i started to think about it i was
like well maybe it makes sense that i
don't see people talking about this
because if it's no good then people
don't usually talk about it so what
you're supposed to do is click it up and
wait for some product to come out so
when i first got it and i saw this tip I
thought that was the eyeliner and I was
like that's really cool it's going to
make a really fierce line that's not the
eyeliner you actually have to twist it
up for the eyeliner to come out oh boy
this is just I mean this is just a
disaster so I was twisting it and like
yes product came out but like too much
product came out so that is no good I
can like show you guys on my hand let's
see if I can do it all it will continue
to do is it comes off and like chunks
and I'm like what like I would try to
put it on my eyes and literally chunks
of eyeliner would keep coming out and I
was like oh okay
I don't know I didn't understand it I
didn't know if I got like a bad one I
was very confused but its twenty four
dollars and I have not been able to use
it yet because each time that I've tried
to use it it's just been chunk after
chunk after chunk on my eyes and so this
one is not going to work out for me so
unfortunately like I think everything
else that benefit sent me was amazing
and awesome and I love benefit I think
they're a fantastic brand but
unfortunately their push-up liner was a
fail for me that was sent to me was from
my makeup brush set and it is a set of
makeup brushes so what's interesting
about these brushes is that they are
really similar so the oval brushes are
like the artiste brushes so this is what
they all look like and they sent me the
10 piece black set so all of the brushes
are that type of style and I was curious
to try these out because honestly I I
don't I don't get these kind of brushes
I don't really understand them and I
didn't know if they really worked i was
very confused about them and what i will
say is that definitely like this has
really been a nice foundation brush it's
not the biggest fresh out of there and
these aren't labeled so I can't say like
this is brush so and so they don't have
like labels to them but it's not the
biggest brush of the group like this one
is the biggest brush and astley I just
thought this was too big for my face but
this one I thought has been working out
really well and I've been really liking
it to apply foundation it's very soft
and it seems to spread everything very
evenly but also very quickly like I
didn't feel like there was any like mess
around when using these brushes and I
like the handles that they're they're
not super firm so when I'm like trying
to get around to places like my finger
can really do the guiding so I ended up
really really liking this brush and I
also really like the brush that i've
been using as a concealer brush which is
this one right here so obviously it's a
lot smaller but it fits in really well
on the under eyes the only thing that i
have an issue with is getting really
really close to the lash line it's kind
of hard to do it with that but
realistically if I'm being very honest
these are basically the only two brushes
that I use out of them
I don't like this big one because I
think it's just too big for my face this
one I've tried to apply blush with it
and honestly I just thought it was
awkward I mean I'm just being really
honest here I just felt very awkward
applying my makeup with this type of
brush I did not try I browse I know they
say like you can do eyebrows with these
brushes I don't have like eyebrow
powders or anything I just have like
pencils and stuff or gels so I wasn't
able to test that but I tried with like
eye shadow to like some of these brushes
to like kind of patent buff the
eyeshadows and I didn't feel like they
worked very well I've seen some people
use these type of brushes as like lip
brushes I don't use lip brush as a whole
lot so honestly I really like the two
that i use for the foundation and
concealer I like those a lot and I reach
for them pretty frequently but the other
ones I don't and that by the brush is
individually on the my makeup brush set
but honestly I think bi'ness that would
actually be cheaper but I mean it's
totally going to depend on your
preference I see some people that use
these type of brushes for everything and
they use it for eyeshadow and blush and
they use it for bronzer and I've seen
people use it for the lips and that's
fantastic but I just have to give you
guys my honest feedback and those two
were the really the only two that I
actually find myself reaching for so I
don't know I can leave the links below
to my makeup brush up they have a lot of
different sets and they have a lot of
different individual brushes and I think
that you might even have like a discount
code with them too it's not an affiliate
code so i don't get anything if you use
it it's just there for you guys but if
you'd be interested i can leave it down
below and while i think these are really
fun and I'm glad that I have them in my
collection if I want to try out
different techniques or things like that
with them then I'm glad that I have them
but really I'm just finding myself
reaching for those to another product
that I want to talk about I've got a lot
of questions throughout this one as well
it's from pixi by Petra it's their glow
missed so this is what it looks like I
picked mine up from target it was
fifteen dollars and it says it's an
oliver face miss for a glowing luminous
and smooth complexion its enriched with
13 natural oils you can use it before
makeup to hydrate protect and nourish
after makeup to set an added dewy finish
and protect or any time to refresh your
makeup hydrate and add a glow you're
supposed to shake well before you use it
so my thoughts on this is that it's
expensive like I'm not gonna lie i
thought at target and i was like oh cool
a new facial mist and it's supposed to
be due at the same time like that sounds
like something i would like and then I
saw fifteen dollars and I was like
really at target like for the drugstore
hmm that seems that seems a little
pricey but I went ahead and did it
anyways you know I have my red card so
let's say five percent so I did it what
I will say about this is that it works
it does what it says that is going to do
and I don't think that you can ask for
much more than that out of a product it
makes your face glowy it simply does the
first time I used it I think I was used
to like the mac fix+ where I was just
like ditched and I looked in the mirror
I like what just happened like I was
glowing so you definitely need a light
hand which means this product will last
a long time which is good because what's
also interesting about this is that I
compared the price of this and how many
fluid ounces you get it to two other
sprays that I have one being at the mac
fix+ which is the priciest at $23 but
you're also getting 3.4 fluid ounces or
again this was fifteen dollars and
you're only getting two point seven
fluid ounces I also compared that to the
Mario Badescu rose water spray which I
absolutely loved I used it this morning
that is only seven dollars from also and
you get for fluid ounces so I mean I did
the comparisons and I was like oh ok
that's interesting but again this really
does work I mean especially for making
your face glowy it's called a glomus
that's what I think it does this I
wouldn't say I think brings out any
colors and anything but I do think it
does help longevity of your makeup
because I've used it I've used it quite
a bit and I don't feel like I have it
all I mean I've been playing with it now
so I'm like shaking it up everywhere but
I've been trying to really test this out
especially in the summer and seeing what
I think of it and so far i really like
it and I think it's doing what it says
that it should be doing which is the
most important to me yes I think it's
expensive so maybe try to get like a
coupon or use your red card at Target or
something but honestly if
does what it says is going to do I'm
impressed with it so I'm gonna give it a
fab I know from Maybelline that I want
to go over is their new color tattoo I
chrome so this is what they look like I
also picked mine up from target and it
was in the shade beige luster so these
are their new color tattoo they're
supposed to be like a metallic eyeshadow
for your eyes they're supposed to be
incredibly long lasting so I picked mine
up and it was 999 which again we're
getting a little bit pricey this watch
didn't necessarily impress me I halves
watched it a few times and I have it on
Instagram but i can try to show you guys
again here the swatch didn't necessarily
like blow me away or anything color wise
I thought it was very light and like
even as I'm swatching it now I'm like is
there anything even in there so that is
the swatch of it right there so again
swash on my hand it did not impress me
but it stayed on my hand all throughout
the night all throughout volleyball and
then I came home and had to like really
scrub my hand to get it off so that
impressed me then I put it on the eyes
it looks much better on the ice then it
does watch on the hand so if you swatch
these and you don't think they're that
impressive try to put him on your eyes
because it was a world of a difference I
will say that I think they are very
long-lasting I like the color that it
gave to the eyes like it it definitely
is like a metallic pop to the eyes which
I thought was really cool I was worried
about creasing because just looking at
the formula of it when i swatched it I
was like this is going to be a crazy
mess and it definitely did crease it
wasn't anything that was super
distracting or I was like oh my gosh my
makeup look so bad but it does crease
which doesn't surprise me but like I
said it's nothing crazy I mean I would
still consider this long-lasting I'm
sorry if you guys can hear my dog she's
just usually she just lays down while I
film and she's all over my office so I'm
sure her color is making a considerable
amount of noise just fantastic well say
though that I did think it was long
lasting the day that I wore it I put it
on like ten o'clock or something and
didn't take it off until later that
night and I
still thought it looked good minus the
little bits of creasing here and there I
also thought it was nice because I could
apply eyeliner over it and it was pretty
easy to do it what's this formula I was
like I didn't know if it's going to be
almost like glitter where it's kind of
hard to get your eyeliner to smoothly go
over it but I didn't have any troubles
with it I do wish it wasn't 999 I think
that is a little expensive but really
cool color cool concept long lasting I
mean I'm gonna give it to it i'll give
it a fab it was fun to play with I don't
know if I need any more shades but it's
fun to have at least one in my
collection if a couple more products
left so another one from Maybelline is
they're super stay better skin skin
transforming powder so I also have the
foundation and I have the concealer from
the better skin line I love Maybelline's
face products foundations concealers
powders I've tried so many of them from
so many of their different lines and I
seem to love them all maybelline fit me
foundation and concealer on right now i
used them all the time so when i saw
this powder come out i was like okay I'm
interested and then I saw a lot of
people reviewing it and saying how much
they loved it so I was like I'm gonna go
buy it so when you open it up you do
have a mirror you have a sponge here and
then your powder over here now one thing
I did not realize when I bought this I
just went to CBS and was like yeah thank
you so much I got home and looked at my
receipt this is 1099 which I thought was
kind of expensive for the drugstores it
like drugstore prices are really getting
up there guys like pretty soon Alton's
just going to be one big jumbled mess
because no one's going to know what
struck store in what I end but I thought
that was interesting and I really wish
as the drugstore is charging this more
in charging us more that they would let
us test things that they would have
testers out like can we please get some
testers up in here because there's been
several times that I've come home from
the drugstore with products that have
already been opened and like tested and
slashed and then I'm like well great
that was a waste so that's one thing
that I really hope is coming if it's not
already like starting to come out but
anyways back to this so they're better
skin line is made with salicylic acid
which is supposed to be you know better
for your skin so the whole point kind of
behind this line is that
supposed to be good for your skin which
I was like all right okay really can't
say if I think that it is and they know
that they do say that you're supposed to
use it on a consistent basis of course
and I don't really do that especially
doing YouTube I'm constantly like trying
new things are trying to show new things
so I don't know if I can really say yes
to that claim but I really do like the
foundation the concealer isn't my
absolute favorite because I think crease
is quite a bit but the foundation I
really do enjoy and then trying out this
powder from day one that I tried it I
was like okay I like this too it gives
such a nice coverage to the skin and I I
have been a big fan of the maybelline
fit me powder for many years now and i
almost think that I like this better and
that really is saying a lot because i
love that maybelline powder i recommend
it all the time I truly don't know what
it is about this powder that I think is
so amazing but it looks so good on the
skin and I really really like the
coverage that it gives honestly it's not
sometimes with powder foundations I can
dust it on and then I'm like that I
actually did it put anything on my face
which is good because you know we always
want to look like we're not wearing
makeup but then ones like you put
something on and you're like no actually
I don't see a difference so that's
confusing like i do see a difference
with this so i honestly have been
reaching for it a lot a lot even days I
don't always set my foundation because
sometimes i don't think i need to
especially if i'm just going to be
sitting here at the house in filming
videos and not really going anywhere I
don't always set my foundation but I
keep finding myself like oh I'll just
I'll just set my foundation real quick
with this like no I don't need to but
I'm still reaching for it so that is
really cool the price I'm not
super-pumped about but I was actually
just looking this up an office website
and Maybelline often has at Alta like
bio and Maybelline get one fifty percent
off or even buy one get one free buy two
get one fifty percent off you know
something so i would suggest maybe
buying it there where you can get a
little bit of a break on the main
products but yeah this one right now is
a big fat in my book
really been loving it robot were
mentioned in my recent makeup haul video
there two brushes from Real Techniques
so I got these in a set from actally if
you haven't watched that video and your
beauty influencer I kind of go over the
website octa Lee and how to get products
to review and mention in your videos and
things like that but I was set this set
it has these two brushes and then it
also has the makeup sponge from real
techniques which is one of my favorites
I talk about that all the time I don't
feel like I need to put that in a review
video because you guys should know i
love it so it came with the expert face
brush which looks like this it is very
densely packed and i was i was curious
about this brush I was like you know I
don't know if I'm gonna love it but
whatever i'll give it a shot i ended up
really liking it I'm not gonna like the
first time I used it I actually use it
with the Maybelline powder and I was
putting it on i think is for a makeup
tutorial i was putting it on a mug yeah
okay this works it's kind of smaller so
i felt like i wasn't may be covering as
much area as I would with like sade the
morphe three or even the Real Techniques
blush brush which i use is like a
blending brush quite a bit so I was kind
of like yeah I don't really know if it's
doing anything but actually especially
when i pair it with the maybelline
powder for packing on powder foundation
it does a really really nice job and i
was impressed with it so now every time
that I go to reach for that may blame
powder which is quite often I'm reaching
for this brush this is the brush that I
want to use to put powder foundation on
my face this is taken over at the morphe
III that's what I used to always use
what was the e3 now the III has been
relegated to dusting away my baking
powder the poor III the poor thing but I
was very pleasantly surprised I did not
think I was gonna like this brush as
much as I did so again it is the expert
face brush again I got it in a set I can
leave the set list it down below I
believe you can get it at alta so i will
leave that set down below but if you
just want to pick up one brush the
expert face brush it's a fab should that
came in there was there deluxe concealer
brush this was a brush that I was like
I'm going to love this brush I just know
it
I was using it to set my under eye
powder and I'm very glad to say i
thought i was gonna love this brush and
i did end up loving this brush even the
very first time i used it when I was
filming that makeup tutorial I Billy
boats my back to school tutorial I was
putting on the powder and I was like yep
uh-huh this was this was one that i knew
i was going to love and I do definitely
much smaller than some of the other
brushes that I use like the elf small
taper it is one that i often use to put
under I powder on and that is much much
bigger so this is smaller but I feel
like it really is actually getting up in
the areas and especially like under my
lashes like I can really get up under
there with this brush and I ended up
really liking it so this was one that
didn't surprise me i thought i was going
to like it i ended up really liking it
so again if you want to get this
individually it's the deluxe concealer
brush but i did look up the set you can
get it at alta it's called the ultimate
base set it comes with these two brushes
that i just talked about the miracle
complexion sponge which is fantastic
it's the little orange beautiful and
you're looking thing and it also comes
with a little case as well a little
brush case with a mirror inside and it
is 1799 which i think is a fantastic
deal so i will link that down below if
you guys are interested in it and i will
try to find if you can get these brushes
a pretty sure you can get these brushes
separately as well i will link those
down below as well but the Real
Techniques brushes got a Fed from me
