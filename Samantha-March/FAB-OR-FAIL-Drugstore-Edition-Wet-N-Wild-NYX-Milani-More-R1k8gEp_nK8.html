channel so i am very excited for today's
video because it is going to be another
first of its kind i feel like i'm saying
that a lot lately but obviously you know
I'm kind of a newer channel so of course
like I haven't done a whole lot of
content and different types of videos
yes of course there's going to be a lot
of first time or videos but also I'm
just trying to pay attention to what
people like to see on youtube what I
like to see on youtube and kind of
create those types of videos so today is
going to be like a fab or fail drug
store edition so basically I have quite
a few items from the drugstore that I
have purchased that I have tried out i'm
going to review them for you guys and
tell you if i think they are fabulous or
if I think they are fail I really wasn't
sure what to call the series like I know
some do like hit or miss buyer by that
sort of thing I could not think of
anything and fabor fail came to me one
night and I tried looking around I
couldn't find anyone else with fabor
fail but I'm pretty sure there's got to
be like two million people out there at
the half ever fail just saying I just
gonna find it in my quick little
research so I was like whatever I'm just
going to use that line but i'm not
totally sold on it if you guys have any
other good ideas for like a hit or miss
x or x fabor fail type of series name
please leave it in the comments below
because i would love to like come up
with one name that i feel like i really
like but yeah so basically i'm going to
be talking about a lot of different drug
store items affordable items and you
know even though something is more
affordable versus more high-end you
still don't want to fill your makeup
collection with items that are just kind
of like either so so or downright no boy
no so i'm going to be going over a few
of these products i'm very excited for
it i hope you guys will enjoy this video
and without further ado I'm going to
jump in with those closest to me and it
was this milani Prime Sheila face primer
it's their mattifying and pore
minimizing primer ok so this primer is
point 6 flew at eight ounces the very
very first thing that I noticed about
this primer is that it feels like it's
half empty like when I picked up in the
store picked it up picked it up off the
shelf I was like is there anything in
here like this feels very strange to me
so I don't point six floating ounces let
me do a comparison
going to go ahead and compare it to the
Maybelline master Prime their blur and
illuminate primer which is one of my
favorite favorite primers and that has a
full fluid ounce versus the Milani which
has the 6.8 fluid ounces and I believe
this primer was 999 which to me for a
drugstore primer that is still pretty
pricey so for 999 I guess I felt like I
would get more than you know just over
half a little fluid ounce so that part
really did not impress me very much so
it says it's going to modify and perfect
skin and minimize the appearance of
pores and fine lines that weight and not
greasy and does not clog pores so I
decided to pick up the mattifying
because milani also came out with a new
one that is more of a lumen ating primer
hydrating primer I went with a
mattifying because summertime is almost
here and my skin just kind of varies on
the seasons usually during the summer i
can reach i can get a little bit more
oily were in the winter I usually need
something more like luminous and
hydrating so that's why I went with the
mattifying primer it does go on
non-greasy to me it doesn't feel like
sticky greasy just kind of like a key on
my face like some primers can feel so I
don't mind the way that it feels on my
face i have not had any irritation with
it i do think it does a pretty good job
i think it does a good job mattifying
the skin i will say that i saw the
mattifying happen i don't know if i see
as much like pore filling as maybe some
other primers but for mattifying i
thought it was good if you're looking
for something that was more of a pore
filler or pore minimizer I don't think
this is the best best bet but if you are
just looking for like a good modifying
primer this one does seem like a good
choice again I'm just kind of not very
impressed by how much you're getting and
for the price that you are paying but II
so if i would have to call this one a
fab or fail i kind of want to like put
it in between can I do that can I put
products in between I don't know I feel
like I would put it in between but more
towards the fab side just because I like
the way it felt on my skin and I like
that it did mattify my skin so for those
reasons i would give it a fab i would
just say like try to use a coupon code
at like CBS rubber you buy these i
bought mine at CBS use a coupon
save a few cents the next product I have
is from covergirl and it is there Oh
sugar lip balm so the packaging looks
like this i think the packaging is super
cute i picked mine up and cupcake also i
will be having a two thousand subscriber
YouTube giveaway going on soon and I
picked up another one of these in a
different shade for that give away but
that will be coming soon so stay tuned
that's coming thank you guys for two
thousand very exciting basically I just
have started running out of my lip balms
because I wear a liquid lipstick so much
I keep wanting to make sure my lips are
hydrated and so when I do where liquid
lipsticks like my lips aren't just like
being totally devastated by drawing
formulas and all that good stuff so I
was running out of lip balms and so I
was at target one day and honestly the
packaging just stood out to me I really
don't know much about these cover girls
Oh sugar lip balms I don't actually have
a lot of cover girl in my collection but
like I said packaging stuck out to me
and this one is called cupcake and I
just thought it was super cute I did
want something that is totally sheer and
if you guys can see like I'm putting
this on my hand this is a totally sheer
lip gloss that is what I wanted so
because I just want something where I'm
like sitting at my computer I can put
some lip balm on like I don't want
anything with color that's why I have my
glasses that's why I have my lipstick
etc so I was really glad cupcake was
completely sheer there was maybe like
two or three others that I thought were
totally sheer as well but if you do like
lip balms with color in it they did have
those options as well has a really nice
scent to it and for some reason when I
heard like I feel like I've already used
quite a bit did I say that like I use
this several several times a day when I
heard the name Oh sugar for some reason
I thought it might have like like some
sort of scrubbing it because I have a
sugar scrub but it's not it's just a
very nice lip balm so it says that it's
a vitamin-infused lip balm mine at
target i think was right under seven
dollars i mean if you guys just need
like a really nice hydrating lip balm in
your collection I definitely say check
these out I'm totally going to pick up
more I feel like I'm going to go through
cupcakes so fast this is a
definite fab next I have to lip products
to talk about as well these are liquid
lipsticks and they are from NYX they are
each part of the lingerie collection
this is what the packaging looks like i
actually just mentioned these in my
april favourites video so obviously what
do you think i gave them big ol fab the
colors that i have are in ruffled trim
and then also a bedtime flirt I have
swatched these and haul video I can read
that linked below for you guys and i
also have a ton of swatch pictures for
them on Instagram I actually in wearing
bedtime flirt right now on my lips I
absolutely love these liquid lipsticks I
picked mine up from Ulta are 6 99 on the
Alta website which is freaking a
phenomenal for a liquid lipstick I just
really enjoy this formula because it's
not drying on my lips at all and that
inner rim thing that I hate so much like
I do not get a lot of it with this which
makes me very very happy it's not tacky
like my two shades i absolutely love and
what I've understood from the next
lingerie line is that like it varies
from shade the shade there are shades
that are not very pigmented there are
shades that are very tacky like there
are shades that are super drying and I
don't know I did a lot of research
before i bought these I don't know why
they're seven dollars but again you
don't want to sell your collection with
items that you're not going to use or
are not worth it and basically
everything that I heard said ruffle trim
and bedtime flirt are two of the best
ones that's why i bought these ones in
particular and I definitely definitely
agree with that so I don't know if I can
say the next lingerie brand on a whole
is fab but these two shades in
particular I think our bomb wearing them
so much and today I did more of like an
orange coral Sparkle I using the morphe
350 for the first time I was like what
in the world lipstick am I going to wear
and I was just looking at all the
different shades and I was like I gotta
do it I gotta wear NICs because I just
love these liquid lipsticks so much
super affordable the next lingerie
liquid lipsticks and bedtime flirt and
ruffle trim get a big AB from me so I
have a couple products from Maybelline
Maybelline is one
of my favorite brands at the drugstore
I've been wearing Maybelline for so many
so many so many years and I just
gravitate toward their section I think
they are one of the drugstore brands
that has done a really good job of
seeing what it is that's trendy seeing
what it is that people like and then
coming out with really good products for
it and I just I really love my blame as
a brand truly do so I have three
different items here to talk about first
one that I have is from their master
fixed line it is they're setting and
perfecting loose powder I love this
stuff this is key when I am putting on
foundation this is what I use to set my
entire foundation like set my whole face
I prefer to use this with the morphe III
if you just watch my morphe hall it's
one of the big fluffy tapered brushes
and i think these two together make my
skin look like they are airbrushed when
i first started using these two together
i could see in pictures and i could see
on film that my skin just looked better
and i have checked it out to it is these
two products the only thing I don't
totally love and this is with any loose
powder is that the powder can kind of
like get everywhere like right now it's
all over my hand because I used it when
I put my makeup on today but that's okay
but it's very lightweight on the skin
like I mean I don't feel this at all on
the skin it doesn't cake it doesn't
settle and defined lines it just might
makes my skin look smoother it looks
better I love it so far I have not
experienced any sort of like white flash
when using or white cast when using
flash photography I don't see that
happening at all which is usually like a
pretty big scare when you're using like
a white loose powder have not have that
happened to me and I've tested it out
with flash photography several several
several times I've never seen it this is
a more expensive for being a drugstore
product it is 999 but like a lot of
times CVS is always having deals for me
or I have coupons so it's nice to be
able to get that so a little bit pricier
but I feel like it's definitely worth it
this gets a big ol fab next one I have
from Maybelline is their master precise
gel pencil looks like this and it's just
like a teeny tiny little guy and when
you open it up like the product
is Tony like can you guys see that it is
so small what I love this for is for my
waterline I really like like the gel
consistency because it kind of reminds
me of the next racial a gel pencil which
i think is like one of the best
waterline pencils out there besides
colour-pop which i think is the best it
reminds me a lot of that type of formula
where it just like sticks to your
waterline and stays there and I
appreciate that so much I have it on
today I've used in many many tutorials
if you guys have seen it oh I got the
brown one and I actually did it on
accident like I just was so excited I
saw it at CVS and grabbed it and went on
with my life and got home and realized
it was brown but that's okay because I
truly have so many different black
eyeliner pencils that I was like why not
do brown and I just love it even more
because the brown is just kind of gives
the look a little bit of a softer look
and so if that's what you're going for
but you don't want to go totally like
nude or beige or white in the water line
you can do brown and I think it is
really pretty this i'm finding on line
between like six and seven dollars i
think i paid in the six dollar range at
CBS for it but i think it was also like
a sail with Maybelline but yeah fab for
me the last 1i have from maybelline is
another eyeliner pencil this is from
let's see it's their master precise by I
studio that's really all it says this is
what it looks like it's just an eyeliner
so it's just a simple black eyeliner it
kind of has like a felt-tip type of tip
here and it's a very very sharp on the
end if you guys can see that like when I
saw it on the packaging I was like ooh
that could be interesting so I picked it
up again i think it was in like the six
ish dollar range i'd say between like
five and seven dollar range I got home
and I used it and the tip is very it's
not stiff which I like because sometimes
when they're so stiff it feels like it's
kind of hard to do anything was but
because it wasn't stiff and I went in
thinking it was like you actually kind
of have to be careful or else you can
like flick it and it's gonna do crazy
things because I definitely have had
that happened to me so that was one
thing that I noticed but
the first like two to three times that I
used it I was actually pretty
disappointed in it because I didn't
think it was very black I felt like I
you know put it on I did my line I did
my wing and then I felt like I had to
come back and either keep going with the
wing because it wasn't black enough or I
came in with my NYC liquid liner and put
it over it just to make sure that I
thought it was black enough I was really
bummed out about it I kept trying
basically because I'm out of every other
like liquid liner except for the NYC and
I mean catch my own a bad day and I'm
gonna look like a raccoon when I use
that stuff so I kept trying and honestly
if you just work on building it up it
will be black enough it took me a few
times but I ended up being very happy
with it I do have it on my eyes today I
have no NYC liner over it and I thought
it worked just fine so you do kind of
have to build it up so when you make
your wing across your I just go back a
couple times make make the line some
more and then when you go to do the wing
just come down keep bringing that wing
down and like especially for me who I
typically make a small wing and then
start to try to build it up and build it
up this actually worked super fine for
it because as I'm continually building
that wing I'm just making the liner
blacker and blacker so in the end it
ended up working for me it was a little
bit of trial and error so I'll kind of
put it again like the Milani like it's
kind of in the middle I don't think that
you absolutely have to have it or
anything like that it's it's okay in my
book but i'm leaning now more towards
like the better side so if i had to pick
fab or fail i would pick fab but it's
more like in the middle for me guys
moving along I just have through more
products left one more brand that brand
is wet and wild one wild in my opinion
is like doing good things right now
they're coming out with a lot of new
products a lot of people are excited
about them I saw that they just came out
with highlighters I have not been able
to find the highlighters I was going to
try to find him to put in this video I
can't find the highlighters yet I'm so
sorry but I'm going to start with one of
the like less newer products which is
their mega glow contouring palette it
looks like this I have it in Dolce de
leche
this thing is bomb i'm pretty sure it's
been in a favorites video i've actually
had it for a few months so it's not
super super new but people are still
asking me questions about it this is
what the inside looks like so you have
your contour shade over here and this is
what i use as like a setting powder for
underneath my eyes it's amazing and it
was like five dollars seriously amazing
it took me forever to find this and i
was getting so frustrated and I was like
what if I friendly find it and I
absolutely hate it that has been no
problem at all at first I just kept
going in with the contour shade and I
was like this contour is so amazing it's
what I have for my contour today I'm
like it's amazing it's easy to build up
it's very pigmented so you need to come
in light hand it and build it up but
it's buildable just fine but like don't
go in with a ton on your brush because
it's pigmented and you're going to look
crazy I was kind of ignoring this side
because i have a Mabel or no I have the
Rimmel translucent powder that's kind of
always what I used and then finally I
just tried it one day and I was like
wait a second why haven't i I've been
using this more because this is super
good as well I said it for under my eyes
or any places that I put concealer like
those areas that I just touched and I
think it works great it doesn't give me
a lot of creasing it really like it
because it kind of gives a brighter
effect for that under eye which I don't
think my translucent powder does so for
that reason I loved it this is a huge
huge fab for me if you guys don't have
this I truly truly think that you need
it in your collection for five dollars
you cannot go wrong the next item is one
that I picked up at target it is their
color icon ombre blush I got mine in the
shade might I buy you a drink because it
looked a little bit like on the PG shot
PG side which i absolutely love and whoa
this is gorgeous it kind of reminds me a
little bit of luminoso from Milani which
is one of my favorite drugstore blushes
and it is just stunning so I don't know
if you guys can tell because I use it so
much and I sty just roll it all together
but this is more of like the dark peach
side and this is more of a lighter shade
so you can either use them like
separately or what I just do
I just mix them together I have it on
today I think it is a stunning blush
I've been wearing it so much I've been
reaching for this more then I've been
reaching for a Luminoso which is super
weird to me but what I love about it it
gives such a beautiful glow it's almost
like this top shade is kind of like a
built-in highlighter and so when you put
it on before I even put on any
highlighter it looks like i have like
peach in my cheeks and then like a
slight PG Sheen highlight glow above
that and I just mmm i think it is
beautiful i'm mostly been using this
with duo fiber brushes those are
typically the blush brushes that i've
been using to apply it i think it is so
beautiful it's very easy to build up
without like if you use a pink blush or
a darker blush you can't build it up or
else you're gonna look crazy but what I
think about luminoso and then what I
also think about this one wild blush is
that you can build it up and you're
still just going to look like super
beautiful and you're just gonna glow I
just love this blush so much i hope you
guys can get it so the one i have is in
might I buy you a drink I have not tried
the other ombre blushes but i have heard
really good things about them as well so
i think this one was like in the four to
five dollar range so again you can't
beat that price went wild you doing good
things this gets fab from me in the last
two items that i have to talk about from
wet and wild are the newest one wild to
my collection and that is there glitter
singles so this is what they look like i
got these at target for ninety-four
cents ninety-four cents and they were
probably on cartwheel i'm pretty sure
they were so I mean they're probably
like ninety three cents whoa I've had a
very interesting experience with these
glitters so the first one that I used
was the silver one these were the only
two shades that they had at my target
and I could not find them anywhere else
so I was only able to get the silver and
gold so this is what the silver looks
like and when I first used the silver I
thought it was beautiful the silver I
thought was just gorgeous there was no
fallout with it which is probably what
surprised me the most I don't find
creasing on the eyelids with it I wore
it all day super impressed with it and
the other day I actually went to film a
tutorial using the gold glitter because
I wanted to do a glitter eye and I
thought oh I'll use the gold glitter
because I haven't used that I don't have
any photographs with the gold glitter
like I did the silver and instantly I
could tell there was a huge difference
so I started applying the gold glitter
to my eyes I'd used the same brush that
I had the silver and I always just use
concealer to prep my eyelids I didn't
have any sort of like glitter primer
that I used with one and not not the
other the gold would not stick to my
eyelids and I kept building it up and
building it up nothing was happening
there's fallout all over my eyes like I
look like a disco ball at the end within
30 minutes my eyelids were totally
creased and I was like this is really
weird and then I went to do a swatch
picture for it and I put my fingers in
each glitter the silver was like totally
dry and it was just putting silver
glitter on my finger the gold felt like
I was putting my finger in oil it was
just oil and like it was disgusting it
was gross and I will put the picture in
here that I put on Instagram and I
actually wrote a full review on
Instagram for it but if you can tell the
gold there's like barely any on my
finger because it's just all oil where's
the silver there's a really good clump
of it on my finger because it actually
is like good glitter so it makes
absolutely no sense to me I have talked
to other people who have the same things
happen to him some are completely fine
some are super oily and basically not
usable so I truly don't know what to say
about these glitters because if I would
only have gotten the silver one I would
have said yes go for it totally
ninety-four cents like this is a good
good glitter the gold I mean I'm never
going to be able to wear this gold ever
so even though it was less than a dollar
it's still something that I just need to
throw away because I'm never going to be
able to use it you barely get any
product on your eyes and then you're I
start creasing annua fault like crazy
like I would never want to put that on
my eyes so it's totally confusing I feel
like this is going to be another
kind of split review because I don't
know I don't know if it varies per shade
I don't know if it just varies per like
little single is what you're going to
get like I truly have no idea I don't
know if I've ever seen that before like
the exact same products but two
completely different outcomes so very
strange so the wet and wild glitter
singles fab on the price fab on some of
the shades but mega fail on the ones
that are oily so I'm going to put this
one in the middle as well and just and
that is everything before this first fab
or fail video featuring all drugstore
products I hope you guys did enjoy this
video again if you have any suggestions
for the series name please do leave them
in the comments below or if there's any
other products that you would like to

the vib so that was going on I wanted to
make sure I got the recommendations
video up and then my haul video of and
then a couple reviews and tutorials and
there as well so it just kept getting
pushed back and then I kept going to CBS
