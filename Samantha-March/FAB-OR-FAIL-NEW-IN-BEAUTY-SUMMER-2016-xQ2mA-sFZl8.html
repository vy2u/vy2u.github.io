today's video is going to be a fab or
fail new and beauty edition so I did one
maybe like a month or sell back and it
was featuring all drugstore products and
it was just me giving my full reviews of
these products letting you know if I
would recommend them wanted to do it
again and this time I'm doing new and
beauty so some of these are like ish new
summer newer and some are really knew it
to the beauty industry but I just
thought it'd be interesting to do
because I really do want to be doing
more reviews on my channel it's one of
the reasons why I started a channel they
just kind of got caught up in the
excitement of like hulls and tutorials
and that sort of thing and I've kind of
gotten away from the reviews so that is
what I want to do now for these products
that I'm going to be going through I
used the majority of them in my last
makeup tutorial it was my trying new
makeup tutorial Matt I tutorial I don't
use all the products that I've mentioned
because some of them I actually picked
up after the fact of filming that video
but majority of them are mentioned in
that video so if you want to see me
actually applying them and putting them
on I will leave that link in the
description box below of either bought
or received some of these products that
I want to talk about and I have just
been testing them out like I've been
wearing nothing but these products
because i want to give full reviews this
is going to be different than a first
impression because while i like doing
first impressions and i think they're
fun especially to put out videos right
away when like something new hits the
market I think that's really fun to do
but I can't really give a full review
and say yeah lasted all day or yeah it
lasted in the heat or yeah it lasted on
this type of skin tight me that is why I
think the reviews are so important I
watched so many reviews like before i
buy anything and i'm serious like
anything i will go to youtube and type
in what I'm looking for and I will watch
review videos to make sure it's going to
be worth my money because I'm
self-employed and I can't just be
spending my hard-earned money anywhere
that I want without further ado why
don't we happen to my favor fail new and
beauty first time I have isn't like
super new I'm pretty sure this came out
like last year but people are still like
talking and raving about it and that's
what made me want to pick up mine and so
I was like well it's still like new ish
right but it's from physicians formula
and it is the butter bronzer so this is
what it looks like and
this is actually the first item from
physicians formula that I purchased from
and at first when I would see people
talk about physicians formula I'm like
why had I not done anything from them
and then when i was at CVS the other day
and I saw this and I was like oh maybe I
could pick this up it's seventeen
dollars for a drugstore browser what
does that even mean the only reason that
I bought this is because they were
having a buy one get one seventy-five
percent off at CVS for physicians
formula so did purchase a segment one
and this one will be in my next YouTube
giveaway I'm planning on doing at five
thousand subscribers so hopefully if
you're watching this you aren't
subscribed get subscribed because I've
been dropping hints about what's going
to be in that 5k giveaway that will
feature two winners I'm talking the desi
sunglasses are going to be in there I
mentioned that last time but this will
also be in there and I'm excited but
that's the big reason i purchased I was
like well I might as well get one for a
giveaway because it seems to be like a
pretty hot item and if I can get a bit
of a sale on it then great packaging is
super super cute it's very like tropical
feeling I like that and then you
actually like press this little button
here and it pops up now it does have
like something underneath I think this
is like some sort of applicator I don't
carry out I don't use it it also does
have a mirror I don't use that either so
I just really focus on the actual
bronzer but here is a close up of the
bronzer it is really really nice there
is a swatch of it on my finger I just
think it's beautiful I like it because
it does give sort of like a light
coverage but if you want to build it up
and make yourself even more bronzy and
glowy you sure can do that I did wear
this in the makeup tutorial video so if
you want to see me applying it it is on
there honestly it reminds me a lot of
the two-faced milk chocolate Soleil
bronzer I think they are really similar
in shades so if I would have to say if
this was a fab or fail I mean a fab on
the product but Phil on the price quick
use a coupon this next product I
actually do have a first impression demo
kind of first thoughts video on it and
it is from NYX it's their sculpt and
highlight face duel so it looks like
this
and i have been using this quite a bit
because i really wanted to test it out
when i first used it on camera I was a
first impression obviously so I was just
using it for the first time and I was
like holy crap I really really like this
and I was so excited about it because I
don't have anything for cream contouring
so like the contouring side of this made
me so excited because it was my first
time like really trying to figure out
cream contouring and I thought it worked
really well so I have been like using it
to death like honestly and both sides of
the product do not have a lot of product
in them so I've been like waiting to run
out at any moment and it's kind of some
of the feedback I've heard too is that
you go through this very quickly like if
you use it every day you're going to go
through very fast so what I will say is
for the highlight side so the shades
that I got our almond and light so the
lights and the highlight shade I like it
I think it's really good I think it is
very drying underneath my eyes
especially and I don't know us there are
very few concealers that i use on my
under eyes that dry my under eyes out
and unfortunately this is one of them
this is not something that i can use
every single day like as i was using it
every single day to review it I started
to notice just like such a dry sensation
on my under eyes and I mean really the
only think I have been doing differently
is using this basically and blew up
every single other concealer so I'm
gonna have to say it's this concealer
that is making me become very very dry
on my under eyes also at first when i
first used it i thought the covers was
really good because i thought it was a
bit of a like thicker consistency and I
was like oh that's awesome like the
coverage is going to be great but I have
some redness on my under eyes and this
does not fully cover that and one day I
tried it with the knicks on one side and
i use my maybelline fit me on the other
side and the maybelline fit me you could
tell had much better coverage than this
one did even when it comes like dark
circles the maybelline was still better
so the highlight side I can't say I'm
like a super super big fan of I still
like it I think it's really pretty and I
think it blends out so well like no
matter if you put it on your under eyes
you know your forehead even to like
clean up a contour on the size of your
cheeks it blends out so well it
just is not like my favorite formula
pushing to the contour side I love the
contour side so again my shade is an
almond okay so here are some swatches so
obviously we have the highlight in the
contour shade so you can kind of see
what the highlight shade looks like but
then for the contour shade it is a
beautiful contour shade it's very cool
toned which is better for contouring it
glides on easily and it blends out again
these blend out so well that was kind of
my fear when it came to cream contouring
was am I going to have like weird lines
all over my face like I don't know how
into that I am but these blend out so
well and I just I really appreciate them
for that I have been going like kind of
crazy with cream contouring since i got
this because i'm just so excited about
it like it excites me to use that i've
even been like contouring my nose more
and i don't know i'm just having a
really good time with it so the contour
side is amazing the highlight side is
good so it's kind of like uh i don't i
don't know what i would write this
product because of what i want to buy it
again yes but just for the contours I'd
like the highlight sides just okay to me
like I feel like I would be able to use
it like maybe once a week but again
definitely not every day because it's
just doing really damaging things to my
under eyes and I've been having to try
to use a lot of like I masks to make up
for the dryness under there so I don't
know this is 1199 it's hard to say if I
would repurchase it simply because I am
only going to be using one side of it
but truly the contour site is that good
so I would have to say fabor feel like
the contour pros beat out the highlight
cons honestly I do so let's give it a
bad so another thing from benefit is a
new product from them they just launched
last month and it is the goof proof brow
pencil now i do have a first impression
in demo on this as well i actually
received a deluxe sample from Ulta they
were giving out deluxe samples one time
with online orders and so I went ahead
and purchased one so the full-size does
have a spoolie on the end and it is much
larger since this is just the deluxe
sample it's smaller and it doesn't have
the spoolie but that's okay because I do
up the NYX micro brow pencil so when I
want to use this I just use that spoolie
that's on there so again I will link my
first impressions video and I was pretty
excited when I use it as a first
impression
and I am NOT someone who does eyebrows
frequently I do love them done today
with the goof proof brow pencil because
of course I wanted to be wearing it I
really do like it I think it's really
good for people who have maybe fuller
thicker eyebrows that you don't need to
draw on your full eyebrow and that is
like me like you just want to fill it in
like a few sparse spots you just want to
fill it in and go about your way I think
it's really good for that and I've been
becoming like more accustomed to doing
my eyebrows with this because I I would
feel like I would need to be like
everybody else you know and like draw on
a whole eyebrow and I would like
overcompensate for it and then I would
just kind of look weird and it wouldn't
be okay so once i realized that i can
use this to just fill in the spots and
then spoolie out the product and make it
look a lot more natural it really became
a lot better for me so yeah if you have
fuller eyebrows and you don't need to do
your eyebrows maybe every day or do a
full eyebrow I would definitely
recommend this it's been working out
really well for me I believe this is
twenty-four dollars for the full-size
ended up really really liking these so
this was a fab for me but then I have
the new l'oreal infallible Pro glow
foundation this was getting a so much
hype on youtube because one that I just
like didn't play into I was seeing
everybody put their first impression
videos up and everybody was snapping
about it i was just kind of like yeah I
don't know about that and I'm really not
sure why because I love glowy
foundations I like L'Oreal foundations
the l'oreal true match and the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi cushion are like some of
my favorite foundation so I'm like what
am i doing why why was this one not
speaking to me and then I was at target
one day and I saw it I was like you
don't what I'm gonna pick it up says
this gives a radiant finish it's for
normal to dry skin it's supposed to be a
hydrating foundation it says it's up to
24 hour foundation I've never tried to
make my foundation last for 24 hours at
the shade 207 sand beige so it says
radiant finish 24 hour wear medium
coverage and an air light texture okay
so i have been wearing this literally
for probably like eight or nine days
straight i have worn no other foundation
except for this bad boy because i have
been putting it to the test my first
thoughts when I first dumped it out onto
my hand was at
this is super super runny like if you
move your hand it's going to go all over
your hand is a very very liquidy runny
foundation I also quickly realized that
you do not have to use a lot of product
and it's going to be all over your face
like I put on what I would say is my
regular amount of foundation when I have
to like squeeze it onto my hand and I
had so much foundation on that was like
what am I supposed to do with this me
and honestly kind of feel similar to
like BB cream because it is super
lightweight on the skin like it says it
has an air light finish I would agree
with that is very very lightweight
parable to a BB cream and I really like
that especially for the summer time when
I don't want to feel like I have a pound
of makeup on my face ended up going and
sitting outside in the Sun BB creams are
like the way that I like to go for the
summer so I really appreciated that
finish to it I really really enjoyed it
the coverage on this is really really
good so like I said I've been wearing it
every day I've been wearing it outside
during walks I wore it all day camping
when we went to the fourth of july
camping and i was outside in the
elements all day and this stayed on has
very very good coverage so i mean like
it says 24 hour wear it it might be
because I mean for me it lasted at least
14 hours the day that we went camping
and it still looked good by the end of
the night so I was very impressed with
that how do the cons that I have is that
it seems to cling to dry patches I'm not
someone who constantly has dry patches
or even really has dry skin I would have
more like normal skin I think sometimes
in the summer I can be a little bit more
oily but every once in a while I'll get
dry patches like especially around my
hairline look up here are my hair lines
on the side like especially my temples
releasing to get dry patches and this
foundation it clings to it like crazy so
aspect I especially noticed it the first
night that I went to take this off and I
was like looking in the mirror after I
took my makeup off and I was like what
is on my forehead up here and I realized
I had actually just like missed that
spot of taking off the foundation and
that foundation was like clung on to the
dry patch and it looked like flaky and
scaly and it was not very cute and so
the next time that I wore it I made sure
to pay attention to that I'm sure enough
I could see it again and I could see it
over by my temples as well so that is
I think so if you have dry skin or if
you just are someone who may be your
normal or oily but you have dry patches
you might not really love this because
it's gonna cling to those like crazy at
least it did for me so I so I don't
think it gives like a super super
radiant finish like I don't know for
some reason when i heard pro glow i
thought i was gonna look like you know
like similar to the full face highlight
challenge I don't know I thought it was
just gonna make me like very like
beaming i would say it makes me look
healthy like it gives my skin a healthy
like you do we finish but it's not a
glow to me on my skin I don't see like a
baked glow with it my skin just looks
healthy which I appreciate I like it but
if you want to buy this because you
think it's going to give you like some
sort of like beaming look I did not see
that in my opinion but again like I
think the pros really do outweigh the
cons once again this is 1199 a little
bit pricey for drug store but honestly I
love the way it feels on the skin you
know minus the dry patches I like the
coverage that it gives I like that it
makes my skin look healthy it's easy to
use a lot of times I just put this on
with my fingers or I'll blend it out
with a beauty blender but honestly like
sometimes my fingers are just faster and
I'll just do it that way or else I damp
Beauty Blender can be really nice as
well but yeah I give this one a fab this
is really good I'm glad that I finally
finally bought into it so I have a
couple products from Smashbox Smashbox
sent me a couple of their new summer
items and in a PR package and I was like
so excited I also did the unboxing here
on YouTube i feel like if i ever get
boxes from brands i will be doing those
unboxings on youtube because it's just
like the most exciting thing in the
world to me like i could just never
really believed it saying that they sent
along was their new blush and highlight
pallets so they actually sent me three
of these blush and highlight palettes
which I was like what like no one has
ever sent me like multiples of items so
I was like what am I supposed to do so I
have been trying one out like I picked
up my favorite one and that was going to
be like my tester throughout this whole
time I have another one that I am going
to keep and then you will actually be
seeing one in my next giveaway also so
this is in pacific coast pink so it has
to blush shades and then a highlight
shade this one will be in my next big
YouTube giveaway so again
hope you are subscribed tell your
friends I just give away comment it's
gonna have this in here so the one that
i have been using is the malibu berry so
when you open it up it has these three
like good-sized shades in here and then
this is a mirror so you have to blush
shades right here and then you have a
highlight shade each one will have a
rich color a true color a highlight
color it's kind of how their palates are
working out and they are really really
beautiful I have the two I mix the two
blushes today on my cheeks and I also
did it in that tutorial video as well I
mix the two and I think they're really
pretty this deeper berry shade on the
end is so so gorgeous I absolutely love
it and then actually for this palette I
don't know why I put it back in its box
I've used both of them but the Malibu
one is the one that i've been using the
most on my cheeks and then this one is
the Culver City coral and it looks like
this now I actually use this on my eyes
and I absolutely loved it so I think
they can be very versatile so i put this
first shade in my crease and then I put
this shade all over the lid and then
also as like a highlight underneath the
brow bone and then inner corner
highlight as well and I loved it so
these are like super versatile I'm so so
happy that I got them so I do think
these are a little bit pricey they are
thirty-five dollars they each for three
shades they are good sized shades and I
like that they can be versatile you can
use them as I blush highlight on your
eyes I like that but I don't know $35 is
kind of a lot of money to spend on these
but I've been wearing them and testing
them out and i truly do think they are
really good they are very very pigmented
so especially when using a blush like I
go in with a very light hand and slowly
build it up because if you put too much
product on your brush right away you're
going to look a little cloudy so I mean
there's such a great quality and great
formula I love the colors of the ones
that i have chosen i'm excited to give
it one away but at $35 they're just a
little bit expensive but if you are
willing to spend that like if you really
like smashbox or you're like a blush
highlight junkie or are you just like
getting like new products I don't care
whatever you want to spin you're running
on I don't
I'm not going to judge you you probably
think I spend money on weird things too
but thirty-five dollars a piece a little
bit expensive but I do have to give them
a fat because they are so good so the
other thing that Smashbox sent along was
there photo/matt eyes eye palette and oh
man so I'm sure you can't really see it
on camera but let me open it up so this
is what it looks like it has a big
mirror it comes with a double ended
brush it is an eyeshadow full of matte
shades and you're supposed to be able to
use these as eyeliners I shadows and
also eyebrow powders so once again a
very very versatile palette this does
run for forty nine dollars I have been
obsessed with this even if I was not
trying to wear this every single day to
be able to test it out I feel like I
still would be it is bomb I love Matt
eyes I have it on my eyes today
obviously I used it in the matte eye
tutorial that i posted last time i use
all shades from here i use the brush
really love the liner brush because i
like using the liner shades out of here
like the blacks or the dark chocolate
shades i like to use the liner brush and
create an eyeliner and makes it like not
quite as like harsh as using like a
liquid eyeliner or gel eyeliner and I
really appreciate that I love the two
like Bay shades in the middle they are
so so pretty I mean it is just it is a
gorgeous palette I like that it has the
black in there as well some pallets
don't have black and I kind of can
frustrate me it kind of reminds me a
little bit of the Kat Von D shade +
light eye palette which is another like
absolute staple of mine but I think
you're getting like a little bit
different colors in here is like there's
some couple pinks in here and are really
pretty blue in here that I absolutely
love the blue I think it's amazing I'm
so happy with this like I am so so happy
they sent this to me because it truly I
cannot stop using it even though my
review period is done and I don't need
to use this anymore if I don't want ever
use it again i will keep reaching for it
i love it gets a big big fat for be so
so grateful to smash box for sending
this to me and then I just have a one
last product to review in oh man was i
excited about this it actually came in
an influenster voxbox so i talked about
influenster quite a bit here on my
channel because i get a lot of different
beauty box boxes from them and
love to haul them and then share the
reviews for them so this one was from
marc jacobs beauty which really shocked
me and I was so excited and in it was
the Marc Jacobs glowstick I mean what
like when I got the email saying like
you're in the Marc Jacobs voxbox I was
like are you kidding me right now like
you're gonna send me the entire glow
stick to review like that is so crazy if
you guys are not signed up with ethyl
ester yet I really really hope you do I
will leave a link below our videos on
here that talk about it and kind of
explain it in more detail but man to get
sent the Marc Jacobs glowstick I was
like so over the moon about it this
highlight runs for $42 and it is called
the spotlight glow stick so far they
only have 1 i'm pretty sure i just have
this one I don't know they're going to
come out with more like different colors
it obviously is of course a highlight
that I have on my cheekbones today I did
wear it in the tutorial as well so you
guys can see me put it on and I actually
put it on for the first time in the
tutorial which was like really crazy but
it is stunning it is a cream highlighter
it looks a little bit like a stick of
deodorant I guess you would say but this
is what it looks like it is just so so
stunning I was such a little bit on my
hand through as well I mean like come on
can you see that hello I mean BAM I love
the look that it gives because it makes
the skin to me look what I love the like
what highlight look and I think you give
them a lot with cream highlighters and i
do not own a lot of cream highlighter so
I was just so over the moon to get this
one I absolutely think it's beautiful
this is another one that even if I
hadn't kept using it to test it out like
I'm going to keep using it I think it's
beautiful I have been struggling with
some like texture on my cheekbones and
I've kind of been staying away from
highlighting because it just kind of
emphasizes the texture so I've just been
trying to like up my skincare game and
do a lot different mass try to help
improve the texture on my cheekbones and
I've noticed like what the cream
highlighter it seems to not affect it as
much like I'm not going to say it
doesn't
affect the texture at all because it
does but when I wear this as compared to
a powder highlight like I feel like it's
a lot more noticeable than with the
cream but I've just been absolutely
loving it it is so gorgeous again
there's a swatch on my hand and here is
what it looks like on my cheekbones it's
absolutely stunning so gorgeous again
it's $42 so yes a little bit expensive
but it is also like big like how how are
you going to go how are you going to go
through like this much pot like I don't
even understand how i would get through
this in a lifetime but you know what I'm
going to be happy trying thank you so
much to Marc Jacobs beauty for sending
this to me thank you so much for
influenster for sending me this box box
I'm just like over the moon so excited
this is a huge fav in my book and I love
it that's going to be everything for my
fab and fail new in beauty edition i
hope you guys enjoyed this video and i
hope you found it helpful again I just

and my full reviews on these products of
course I loved a lot of them and
honestly you know some of them more sent
to me but some of them i have bought and
when i said in the beginning of that i
look at the reviews first like I don't
