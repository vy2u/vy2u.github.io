today's video I am so excited to do
because I am going to be unboxing these
spring box for FEHB fit fun this box is
huge I have this video is sponsored by
that bit fun and I am so excited to
partner with them on this video this is
my first about fit fun unboxing on my
channel which has me so excited if you
guys are not familiar with a fab that
fun it is a seasonal subscription
service so every three months or four
times a year you would get a box this
one is a big spring box the boxes are
forty nine and ninety nine but they do
contain over $200 worth of products in
there and what always has intrigued me
about fabfitfun is that it's not just
beauty and makeup but it's also
lifestyle fashion and fitness which that
part always has me really pumped up I
watch everybody's fabfitfun unboxings
because I just think it's so cool to see
what is inside these boxes so I'm really
excited to bring you guys of this
unboxing I do also have a discount code
they did give me one for $10 off of your
first box it is not an affiliate codes I
don't make a commission off of it it's
just if you want to try out that fit fun
you can get $10 off your first box but
if you would like to see what is inside
my spring box why don't we go ahead and
get started already so inside it does
have this own little like newspaper a
guy and then inside it will have
everything listed out that can come in
the box the paper kind of explains
everything and then it just has all
these different little articles in here
they talked about the charity in there
which i think is a lot of fun it
explains the products that comment said
the fabfitfun box so this was really fun
to go through and then also it will have
all of the prices for everything that
you get in your box it will have that
listed in there so if you're someone who
likes to add up the total you can do
that with this paper first item that was
on top I don't feel like it's not
necessarily like a part of the box but I
wanted to mention it because I think I'm
gonna finally do it they included a
coupon for hellofresh and it says it's
for $50 off your first two boxes and
free shipping and I think that I'm gonna
do it it's the subscription service for
food I do not cook and I'm just really
curious about this they deliver it
alright to you I've watched videos about
it it looks really cool has anybody
tried hello fresh because now that I got
this online
I think I'm gonna go ahead and give it a
try so I just thought I'd mention that
so I thought that was pretty cool and
it's something that I genuinely want to
try out one thing that I really like
about subscription boxes and watching
people unbox them is seeing what gets
them excited because it's usually
something different for everybody
because we're all different people I
know so it's fun to see what has people
excited or what has people like this is
something that I wanted to get and that
sort of thing so I'm excited to let you
guys know what has me the most excited
of this box and see if I like surprised
anybody by what my choices are first up
here we have a candle which this one did
have me excited and I feel like if you
do follow me on other platforms you
probably know because we typically
always have a candle I don't I don't
ever have like a candle running in my
background but we typically have a
candle in like our kitchen living area
and I do appreciate having them so this
is a number 15 in fresh linen and it was
so funny because I pulled this out of
the box and I smelled it and I was like
oh it smells like laundry and I had my
husband smell and he goes no it smells
like like fresh linen and I'm like did
you look at the box they don't you know
that's what was called so this is what
the candle looks like and it does it
smells like fresh linen it smells like
laundry it says it has mandarin orange
kaffir lime probably saying that wrong
clover white sea lavender sandalwood
patchouli and I just I just enjoy it
says it's the sunset collection candle
in fresh linen and these are $45 whoo
that is an expensive candle it's very
heavy too so I really enjoy candles so
that one is definitely I win for me you
know of course with subscription boxes
you always kind of run the risk of will
everything work for you where the
majority of items for free on things
like that so I was really happy to find
a candle in there and then the next item
also has me really excited and I feel
like this one's kind of rid of what it
did so this one is a sleeping mask so it
came in this little bag like this and
when I pulled it out I was like oh my
gosh this is a legit sleeping mask and I
am really excited about it I've got a
sleeping mask a couple months ago and
I've never really been one to wear them
but I started having problems sleeping
and just falling asleep waking up in the
middle of the night waking up multiple
times in the middle of the night I was
happy
all kinds of issues and I always have
the sleeping mask sitting next to my bed
and one night I was like I'm just gonna
try it and it has helped me tremendously
I I don't know I guess I just never
really knew why people were sleeping
masks I don't know I just never had the
need for them and since I've had trouble
sleeping I've started using it and now I
use it almost every single night and
I've been telling Mitch about it's not
much as having trouble sleeping as well
of course and he has been asking about a
sleeping bath so when I got this I was
like okay I'm gonna keep this one and
then you can have my other one cuz it's
just like a basic black one this one is
a little bit more girly so it's really
cool inside it has like the cooling and
Sur because when I took it out I was
like oh this has something in it so what
I can do is like a couple hours before
bed I can pop it into like the fridge
and it'll get cooling so then when I put
it on my eyes I'm that's the part that
I'm most excited for with this mask so I
was really excited when I saw this and
know how much can have my other one and
I can have this one and we can finally
fall asleep and sleep through the night
and it will be lovely so that is the
Free People understated starry eyed
travel eye mask and it says these are
$40 woo it's a store the cooling pouch
in the fridge to help a deep Huff weary
eyes so I thought that was really
exciting so that was good for me though
next up in here I do have a jewelry
piece so this is the little bag that it
came in and this is from Maya Brenner
it's a signs and says it is a love
bracelet I'm not gonna lie when I first
pulled it out I thought it was a
necklace and then I was kind of
examining it and I was like no that
seems way too small for a necklace but
it is a bracelet which I actually like
that more I'm not a huge jewelry wearer
I've been wearing your news the last
couple days which is really exciting for
me I should with glue wear a watch but
like bracelets and necklaces I don't
wear a ton but I tend to lean towards
bracelet verses and necklaces so I
thought this one is really pretty and it
says love on it again not a huge jewelry
person so I can kind of like take our
leave jewelry but this one it says it is
$65 whoo
it says tip pair this a dainty piece
with a statement watch oh yeah that's a
good idea
oh I wouldn't have thought of that I
like the little tips in there I don't I
don't have the brain for that so that's
awesome so next up here this
in a bag like this I want to show you
guys how everything came as well this is
a Rachel Polly reversible clutch and it
says it will come in three different
shades and this is very large if you can
see inside I'll try to do some close-ups
as well but this is very large this
could be a good travel bag or a good
travel makeup bag skincare bag
especially if you're going out of town
for like more than a night or two I feel
like you can really fit a lot into this
so that's pretty cool I don't think the
print is necessarily fully me and I can
see the pictures of like what the other
prints would look like none of them are
necessarily my taste but this is such a
large bag then I feel like it could be
really nice for traveling and this one
is $60 and again it says it is
reversible it says you can use the
pattern side to add a pop of color and
use the reverse side ten more elaborate
outfit so there is that clutch next up
in here we have a lip palette and this
one is the ish lip statement palette so
this is what the palette looks like and
then inside you have a mirror and a
bunch of different lip shades and then
it also does come with a brush I am NOT
a lip palate kind of girl so this one
doesn't get me super hyped and I would
toss this one on to someone who would
use a lip palette more I think lip
palettes are really good for makeup
artists or if you do other people's
makeup quite a bit even if you're not a
makeup artist things like that but I
know plenty of other people that do
enjoy lip palette it just isn't really
an item that gets me going that says the
lip palette is $42 so if you're into lip
palettes you would like fat ones I've
been here was some skincare from Murad
which had me pretty excited because I've
only tried a few products from Murad but
I hear pretty good things about the
brand this is the skin perfecting lotion
it does it's an ultra light oil-free
moisturizer to help blemish prone skin
and stay smooth and healthy while also
providing hydration which is what I I
need hydration
I need lots of help right now and I
think I'm having more breakouts because
I'm having problems sleeping and we're
going through you know it feels
stressful time in our life right now and
all that fun stuff so I'm excited to try
this out
says that it is a $40 and it also helps
to minimize the appearance of pores and
refines texture and soothe redness and
irritation so some skincare from Murad
which that has me excited I will be
cooking that and trying that out then I
also saw a product here from dove this
is a crushed macadamia and right
milk exfoliating body polish I'm excited
about this one as well anything with
like exfoliating my body I'm into that
so definitely going to be putting the
dub exfoliating body polish in my shower
so I was excited about that next up I
have this item here from Korres and this
is a body butter again this is something
that I will be keeping I love body
butters I love lotions but especially
when I hear butter and I think of like a
really like thick hydrating this a for
my poor dry skin here in Iowa I get
pretty excited about it
I hear really good things about the
brand Korres as well so I'm excited to
try this one out says that this guy is
$24 so again I will be holding on to the
Korres body butter and I'm excited about
that stuff in the box is this a derma
select makeover concealing Ridge filler
and when I pulled it out I was like what
does that mean and I looked on the back
it says it's the first peptide infused
anti-aging nail treatment it says that
you can strengthen weak brittle hard to
grow nails or treat acrylic or gel
damaged nails I actually did just go out
and put my nails back on today I I was
without acrylics for about four days and
I was driving myself crazy and so when I
first pulled this out I was like okay
it's a nail product so I don't need to
keep it but then when I read it I was
like actually I am going to keep it this
is what it looks like and since I can
now take acrylics off at home obviously
when you take acrylics off your nails
just look horrible feel horrible and all
of that so I think the next time that I
take my acrylics off to let my nails
have a breather it will be nice to have
this around to kind of help start
repairing them before I go and put nails
back on them so I am gonna keep this one
for the next time that I take my
acrylics off and so it just says it's a
peptide infused concealer plus treatment
anti-aging Ridge filler so I'm actually
excited about this once I figured out
what it was and how it could help me out
with like my personal nails stuff I was
excited about it so if you're someone
who you just have like the really
brittle nails maybe nails that peel or
crack or break a lot you could try
something like this or if you're someone
who gets acrylics or like gel polishes a
lot and you want to take a break from it
this could help and not kind of like
in-between time cell
I'm excited about the Sun and then the
final item that I have is the one that
not only I'm the most excited about but
also my husband and it is this physique
massage roller I pulled it out and was
like yes and then when Mitch came home I
was like Alec what came in the box and
he was so pumped up we have had this on
like our shopping list forever to get
something like this so we are excited
we've already been using it the fast
couple days on like our backs shoulders
even like I do a lot of leg works out
like workouts so I've been rolling this
on my legs I am so happy to have this ok
so this is the physique 57 massage
roller it says does wonders for sore
aching muscles I agree improves
flexibility break up scar tissue and
keep tender muscles at bay and this is a
$20 so honestly I don't know if this
sounds weird but this is the thing that
I was most excited about in the box and
that we've used several times over now
so not only me but also my husband has
been getting use out of this which i
think is awesome so that is everything
that came in my fat pit fun box I hope
that you guys enjoyed it seeing the
unboxing I'm really excited because the
majority of the contents are items that
work for me that I will be keeping that
I will be using and that guy said I like
that this one is a little bit different
from just makeup and beauty because I'm
excited to have a candle for example I'm
excited for this foam roller for the
sleeping mask like items that wouldn't
come and just a makeup our beauty
subscription boxes so I'm really excited
to have some of those there was just a
few items in here that aren't my
personal tastes or something that I
would get use out of but on a whole most
of the items in my box worked out well
for me and I'm really excited to try
them so if you guys get a fabfitfun box
