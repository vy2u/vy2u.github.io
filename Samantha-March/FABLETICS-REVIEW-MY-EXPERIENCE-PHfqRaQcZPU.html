today's video I'm really excited to do
I'm going to be sharing my experience
and kind of reviewing fabletics this
video is going to be in partnership with
fabletics which has me very excited
because they are a brand a website that
I've been purchasing from myself and
having memberships with since around the
time that they launched so this is
pretty cool to me and I'm a quite
excited self so I'm going to be going
over how fabletics works I'm going to be
sharing my latest outfit that I have
from them and then just hopefully kind
of answering any questions sharing my
experience and feedback that I've had
with giving and the workout outfits from
them but if you are ready to jump into
this video why don't we go ahead and get
started okay so of course I will have a
link down below to fabletics if you are
new or you do not have a membership with
them they have a new membership deal
where you can get two pairs of leggings
for $24 and that will be available
through my link so like I said I'm
really excited for this one because a
fab let expose co-founded in 2013 by
Kate Hudson who's an actress and I
thought that was very cool and at the
time is it was probably about a year
after they came out I started a
membership with them fairly shortly
after they came out because I was just
super interested in this idea if you
guys don't know I love fitness I love
working out I've shared my workouts
across snapchat Instagram stories I've
talked about my workout plans in YouTube
videos in the past and also if you don't
know I used to have an Instagram fitness
page and it is why something like
fabletics really caught my attention
because I was posting over there daily
and you know I'm sharing my yoga photos
and one thing that I've noticed with
Instagram that maybe isn't different
from beauty is that you wanted to wear
cute clothes in your post everybody else
was wearing their cute clothes and
sharing off you know showing off their
poses and all of that and I was like I
want cute clothes too but also cute
workout clothes are expensive you know
I've done a couple of like collective
haul
here recently and I've talked about some
of my workout gear and they're pricey so
when I was trying to really uh you know
be motivated and keep sharing my photos
and you know making my video so I could
share about on Instagram I really wanted
to have the cute workout clothes but I
also couldn't afford
I loved the really expensive stuff
either and so that's why I fabletics
really caught my attention I'm pretty
sure I just saw a commercial one day for
them and it was like wait what what is
that you're telling me because even back
then you know you got specials like the
two leggings for $24 and things like
that and that's like unheard of so I was
like wait what huh me sign me up
but so a fab Lennox I want to kind of
break down how it works because it can
be a little bit confusing in the
beginning so hopefully I'll break it
down the best that I can if you have any
questions for me um since I have been on
and off with fabletics for like three
years now or something like that I
hopefully can be able to answer them
pretty well for you but when you sign up
so first I'll have you take a style quiz
and then that way when you kind of have
like you're like showroom that will pop
up of your different outfits to choose
they'll kind of be more coordinated to
you you know you know do you do yoga do
you like running you know things like
that um the colors that you like your
your style preferences that your give
your sports bras the pants that you wear
so you'll take the style quiz so you
have that information and then you can
either decide to join as a regular
member or as a VIP member as a regular
member there's no monthly membership
charge or anything like that and you can
just buy whatever it is that you want
from the fabletics website but you do
pay a full price for them and then the
prices are you know full priced workout
items depending on what it is that you
want if you want to have a VIP
membership you are charged forty nine
and ninety five a month and then that is
put towards whatever purchase that you
want and then if you want to purchase
more than that then you get discounted
you get a discount amount on the other
items that you want to purchase so
hopefully that makes sense and so you
know it's the forty nine ninety-five a
month that will go towards whatever
purchase it is that you want and then if
you're going to do over the
then that's where you get discounts for
being a VIP member so it really just
depends on which one it's gonna work out
better for you me it helped being a VIP
member because it was just helping me
have the cute and stylish clothes for my
Instagram photos without having it be
too pricey and then a really good thing
that I think is super important with the
VIP membership is that you can either
use you can either choose to shop or
skip for the month and also a thing that
I think is really awesome with fabletics
is that they will send you a reminder
email at the beginning of the month
saying remember to come into your
account choose if you want to shop that
month choose if you want to skip that
month if you choose to shop that month
then you get charged to the 49.95 if you
choose to skip that month you don't get
charged anything you sell your
membership everything is still there you
can go on to the next month you can
decide to shop or skip again I think
that's really important because
sometimes with a membership like this it
can be kind of the same thing like when
I used to get epsy or the other makeup
subscription bags sometimes you just get
too much and you're a little bit like
backlogged and that's kind of how I
could feel you know after doing a couple
months of fabletics I'm like okay wait
so now I have all these outfits and all
these all these fun leggings and tops
and sports bras but like now I'm getting
too much in so let me pause I don't have
to break my membership or anything like
that but I'll pause for a couple months
and then when it's like I can cycle
things out or I can you know kind of do
a declutter of my closet or my drawers
or things like that then you can start
up again so I think that that's really a
really important thing as well if you do
not go into your account within the
first five days of the month you get
charged on the six if you do not go in
and pick shop or skip you will get
charged the 49.95 but if you don't use
it if you don't purchase an outfit that
month you will get a credit to your
account and then you can use that credit
for the next time as well so even if you
do get charged and you don't use it that
month it will you know what kind of like
carries over to the to the next month so
you're never gonna lose that
so hopefully that all makes sense I know
kind of in the beginning just because
I've done it myself I know that it can
be
little bit confusing I mean honestly a
lot of these kinds of things are you
know it's you're kind of unsure in the
beginning and especially when it's a
membership and you know you're gonna be
charged something monthly it's like okay
what exactly am I getting how exactly
does it work am I locked into this do I
have to do it and that's why I think the
shop and skip is so important it's just
a little bit about how the service works
and the difference between a regular and
a VIP membership again if you would have
any questions you know I've been doing
this for a while like kind of off and on
with fabletics but I've been doing it
for a while so I'm trying to think back
of when I first signed up and any
questions that maybe I had so if you do
have any just leave them in the
description box for me but I thought I
would show you the most recent outfit
that I got from fabletics I was actually
wearing the sports bra and the top in my
brands I left before PR video so I have
like just a full outfit here so I have
leggings the sports bra and then a top
as well so the leggings everything like
everything that I've gotten throughout
the years with athletics has been really
great quality you know kind of the idea
behind the poetics if you've never seen
any of the commercials because I still
see them a lot as well is kind of mixing
like fashion and fitness and that's one
of my favorite things like you know
anything about me it's that I love my
yoga wear I love athleisure and I will
wear those out I do not care like I
really will I love being comfortable I
love being comfortable when I go out but
it's like you're not wearing sloppy
sweatpants or a t-shirt like you're
wearing cute items and I wore this
outfit out the other day it was just -
my husband's a slow pitch game but I
still rolled up to the slow pitch fields
in this full outfit okay so I've been
wearing this so I did cut all the text
off but I kept them here so I could tell
you exactly which ones that I got so the
leggings are the Delta Capri tight they
are seamless moisture wicking a fabric
and they're perforated details for
ventilation hits mid-calf and it's a
light compression okay and I love this
color I'll also include like a photo of
me or a video of me trying these on as
well I love this color when I saw
I was like this this is the color that I
need to have I'm super into this color
and then you can see along the side here
it does have the little ventilations
here on each side
they are high-waisted which I enjoy it
very much and then they're super
comfortable as well I got mine in these
size extra small which is supposed to
fit a size two to four and I think that
they fit really well um they're they're
on the smaller side if you are more
towards a size four I would say maybe do
a small if you lean more towards a two I
would say do an extra small eye
sometimes I'm kind of like right in
between but I could that's kind of what
I noticed like they fit me really well
and they fit very snugly they're kind of
like the second skin leggings but I like
that so if you don't like that I would
size up or again if you're closer to the
size board I would size up as well to a
size small but those are what the
leggings look like I'm so happy with
them I really like the color as well and
then it had the matching sports bra
which I was like yep please need that
color as well
so this one is called the Estelle a
sports bra again it says its moisture
wicking it has breathable power mesh
paneling removable cups and it's for
medium support so this is what the
sports bra looks like I think it's super
cute and once again I got the size extra
small which is supposed to be four sizes
two to four now absolutely love that
that color and then you can see it has
the mesh right there and then the tank
top that I got is called the Winona tank
it says novelty floral mesh and a
flattering shirttail hem and again I got
mine in the size extra small so this is
what the tank top looks like so you can
see it I mean it is completely
see-through and it's fully mesh and then
it kind of like Criss crosses in the
back here as well but I thought it just
paired super well over this kind of like
light pastel color I'm again when I word
off the other night I wore the full
outfit together and I just thought it
looked really cool it was a nice
contrast between the black and kind of
like that lilac color stuff at the top
looks like it's really nice to be able
to work out actually I mean you could
even wear this one going out as well but
I thought the entire off it was really
cute together everything that I've got
the ears has been really high-quality I
still have a bunch of my pieces bum-ass
tablet expel twith anything like like
I'm looking at the leggings that I'm
wearing right now which are not as
high-quality and they've kind of fade it
very easily throughout like being washed
and stuff I've never dealt with that or
you know like anything ripping our
getting holes in it or or anything like
that and so I think everything is really
high-quality but pretty good variety of
sizes from double extra small xx small
to 3x is the sizes that they carry but
that's about it for this video it's just
gonna be a quick one I was just I was
really excited to be able to work with
fabletics cuz again it's just it kind of
like took me back to my fitness
Instagram days and how excited I would
get when my leggings would come and I
think it's a really nice service because
athletic wear athleisure can get super
pricey so I know it's kind of scary
doing a membership and trust me like
like I dunno because I did sign up for
it but once you see what you can get
with that money and then being able to
get the discounts on top of it it worked
out really well for me will it be a
service for everybody no um you know if
you don't wear a lot of these types of
outfits you know you could sign up as a
regular member to see if you would like
the pieces but if these are pieces that
you buy a lot or you find yourself
spending a lot of money on higher price
athletic wear I'm you know maybe it
could be something that you could look
into and it would help you save some
money but I would love to know if you
guys have ever tried it at all
and of course your experience with it
it's awesome for me to read but also
awesome for other people to read too so
let me know if you if you have any
experience that you could leave in the
comments as well but a big THANK YOU to
fabletics for working with me on this
video this was really cool for me this
one was uh this one was pretty darn
exciting for me as well but other than
that guys that's gonna do it for today's
video if you guys didn't enjoy it I hope
that you'll give it a thumbs up I hope
that you'll also consider subscribing
before you go and I'll catch you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
