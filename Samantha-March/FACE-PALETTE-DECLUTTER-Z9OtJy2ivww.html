today's video is going to be a new
declutter and today we're declaring my
face palette collection oh man is going
to be very sad I am pretty excited for
this video though I do enjoy doing the
clutters and I know that they are
necessary to do and I really didn't even
realize how out of control my face
palette collection had gotten that's not
even the full of it we do have a little
bit more over here as well so I do need
to declutter it but I'm also excited
because a part of this video is going to
be sponsored by a Poshmark
so stay tuned until the end because I
want to be showing how I put my makeup
products that I purchased for myself
and the ones that I'm decluttering how I
put them on Poshmark been using the
Poshmark
app for quite a few months now and I
find it really really helpful not only
for makeup but for like my clothes and
my shoes as well so I am really excited
about it so I will be showing here's a
little bit of my phone here be showing
you like my closet and the things that I
have for sale you can see I do
definitely a lot of clothes on here but
I do also put here are some of my makeup
items on here for my last two clutter
and such so I'm really excited towards
that so again that will be at the end of
the video and I'll kind of explain what
I do with my decluttered makeup because
I don't feel like I get too in-depth in
that in my dick letters but I will do
that along the way as well so if you are
excited and ready to see another makeup
declutter why don't I go ahead and get
started
already so again here is an overview of
my face palette collection and like I
said I didn't quite realize it had
gotten this out of hand so when I was
putting all of the products out I was
like well wait a second I did not
realize I had this many in here so I'm
just gonna kind of grab in this first
one here is the tardis contour of volume
a3 palette now I did just do a video on
my top a favorite face palette I wanted
to do that before I did the declutter so
I have that video up and I will leave it
link down below but the ones that I
mentioned in there I won't go too in
depth with with my declutter is I like
to give a little bit of an overview of
the product as well but since I just
reviewed so many of those I think I had
12 in that video I'll just go ahead and
link that below for reference but this
was mentioned as a favorites really love
the shades inside so I am going to keep
that one also from Tarte here this is
the big blush of book 3
I got this unto me from a subscriber
which was super cool because I've been
saying I was eyeing it and I really
really enjoyed this palette I the
blushes in here are I think are
fantastic and very much like the
Amazonian clay blushes this one in I
believe its kindred is one of my
absolute favorites peachy mindful the
highlight is really nice as well lavish
it's a good neutral blush so I
definitely do want to keep this one I've
been getting a lot of use out of it I
have some morphe face palettes here so
let's see this one is I guess I could
look on the back this one is the desi
dangeraffe face palette it's mostly
filled with highlights and I will say I
did get this sent to me from morphe but
I have not used it yet because I tried a
different more of a face palette first
which I didn't love and I think that
kind of like deterred me from using this
one but I do hear really good things
about it so I want to keep it because I
do want to try it out actually I think
actually did try that shade because it
looks like it looks like a brush has
been in there so I think I've tried that
one but I do want to try it out for the
highlights because I did share good
things about this one so I'm gonna hang
on to it and finally give it a try okay
this one I was really upset because I
didn't include it in my favorite face
palette video and it definitely should
have been someone left me a comment was
like wait where was this one I was like
No how did I forget this one this is the
Becca cosmetics and collaboration with
Jaclyn hill I think it was called like
the champagne and glow face palette
we've different blushes in there and
then champagne pop and Prosecco pop and
this is truly one of my favorite
palettes I realized I think why I forgot
it is because it was in like a different
section of my makeup collection which
sounds so bad but when I went to grab
for my face palettes I went into the two
places where I store them and grab them
out and this one was put some somewhere
else
and I just forgot about it it should
have been put it in my favorite section
it wasn't too addition it's not
available anymore but truly a favorite
so I want to keep that one so we're
doing really well so far and let me grab
these other morphe pellets that i was
mentioning this one is the 9c so this is
the one that i used right away like I
said I got this one from morphe and I
was really excited about excited almost
purchased this one myself a couple of
times and I ended up not going for it
and I'm glad that I did because it
really just didn't work for me a lot of
the colors in here I found didn't work
for me but also I could get a contour no
bronzer shade out of this but they were
really really hard to blend I
didn't think that they looked good on
the skin at all and then kind of these
studying powders up here I didn't think
they really did anything either so
overall I was actually pretty
disappointed with the palette so that
was a bummer so I am gonna declutter
this one now what I do with my de
clutters is typically everything that
you see in my makeup collection is items
that I have tried if I get something in
PR or I go in to purchase something and
then don't use it which doesn't happen
very often but in the weird cases that
that would happen what I do is I would
just put those aside for a giveaway if
something makes it into my collection I
am typically using it and I do not put
used items into a giveaway another thing
that I can do with items that have been
use or haven't been open as I can donate
them we donate on a pretty regular basis
not only for like makeup clothes but
also like we just add a kitchen to
clutter things like that so that is
another option that I can do with new
and unopened makeup products otherwise
if something has been used I won't put
use items into a giveaway and you can't
donate used items but or use makeup
products but what I will do is I can
pass them on to friends and family which
is always really nice if something was
received in PR and I have used it I will
not sell it again I will pass it on to a
friend or family member and then also
what I will do if I did purchase
something myself and I do end up to
cluttering it that is when I can put it
on Poshmark but I'll show at the end
which ever items that I can put on
Poshmark I'll show you how I do it and a
little bit more about it but I do like
having that option and I have really
heavily utilized it really ever since I
downloaded the app myself so I did want
to mention that but I'm going to go
ahead and put this in the declutter non
Poshmark pile if that makes sense
and then the other one here from morphe
this one is the 9n palette and this is a
blush palette I have used this palette
and I do really like it I especially
like some of the neutral blushes in here
but it wasn't anything that I felt like
really like rocked my socks off and I
really barely reach into it especially
between the Tarte palette and then just
some of my favorite blushes and favorite
blushes out of these face palettes I
just don't reach for it as much so I'm
going to go ahead and put that
my declutter pile as well next up here I
have this little pallet from a Clarence
this was sent to me via octal II which
was really awesome I think this was one
of my first like Clarence makeup
products that I tried and I ended up
really enjoying it it has a setting
powder a bronzer and then a blush and it
has a nice mirror this is a really nice
palette and this is one that comes
traveling with me so much I almost
considered putting this in a my
favorites video and really it's like
it's like right up there so it is the
face a contouring palette I want to say
that this was limited edition so I'm not
sure if it's available anymore if I can
find it I will leave it like down below
but I do like it like I said it comes
travelling with me quite a bit so I'm
gonna go ahead and hold on to that one
this one here from pixie I did mention
this in my palette favorite video so I'm
gonna go ahead and hold onto it this is
one that was in a collaboration with
Miriam NYC and it is the glow and bronze
palette because there are two different
palettes of this one so because that was
a favorite I'm gonna go ahead and hold
on to it I'm not doing very well here
this one is from Anastasia Beverly Hills
it's a contour cream kit I did have a
subscribers on this one and to me as
well
only like very lightly dipped into it so
far I haven't done a ton with it yet so
I want to hold onto this one so I can
test it out fully and review it and all
of that good stuff so we're not hold on
to that one oh my oh my face palettes I
really like one of my weaknesses though
so and if you can hear my dog snoring
she is right next to me snoring away so
this next one here is from a Sonia
Kashuk I really like the packaging on
this one this was called the pretty
cheeky face palette I bought this off a
recommendation from Casey Holmes from a
target
it was a pricey palette it was $20 which
I thought was pretty expensive
especially for like Target drugstore but
Sonia Kashuk is known to be kind of like
that more higher priced for affordable
line if that makes sense so inside you
have a highlight of bronzer and blush I
was kind of worried about this blush
because it is a little bit orange I was
like I don't know if that will really
work for me but I ended up really
enjoying it my only problem is is that
it is limited edition and it's not
available anymore and whenever I wear
this and people will ask me what it is
I feel bad always having to say
well it's not available anymore and it
just it kind of sucks so I actually
think I'm going to go ahead and
declutter it I remember a ward again the
other day had someone asked me about it
and I had to go through the whole spiel
and it just made me feel bad I like it
but I don't like love it enough in order
to keep it around for that reason so I'm
gonna go ahead and declare this one I
did purchase it myself and it is lightly
used so wouldn't put anything on
Poshmark
if it's you know like if I hit like pan
on this or it's really old or something
like that you know I wouldn't put that
up to sell but since this one is lately
use with most of my makeup because I'm
I'm not a savage when it comes to my
makeup and I did buy this myself so I'm
gonna go ahead and put that in at my
Poshmark pile next up here this is
another one that was mentioned in my
favorites video this is from a pier and
it's the gold digger palette this is the
one that I use mostly as a face palette
so that's why I include it in there it
does have a shadows over here but I
utilize it the most for the face palette
side so big favorite of mine I think
it's still on sale on the hello I think
it's still on sale at the pier website
so I would check it out I will have all
of these linked down below like I always
do so that one's gonna go in the keep
pile next up here I have this one from a
Smashbox this is a trio it's called the
LA lights blush and highlight palette in
Culver City coral man I really did like
this palette is well it has two blushes
in there and a highlight and it does
have a nice mirror I think it's really
pretty but I just don't reach for in a
ton and I feel like I've talked about
this before in the past I don't remember
what video I was doing but I felt like I
mentioned these and was like I just
never heard anybody talking about this
I'm not even really a hundred percent
sure if they are still available or if
they were like a limited edition item
I'm really not sure so I know that I
haven't reached into it for a very long
time so even though I like it I like the
shades I like the highlight I still
think I'm going to go ahead and put it
in my the clutter pile and then let's
see this next one here I also did
mention in my favorites video this is
the wet and wild mica glow contouring
palette and - and dulce de leche so you
have a setting powder on one side and
then a bronzer on the other this is my
second one of these you can see that
pretty like significant done I think you
can see it anyways on camera on the
setting powder side because I really in
outside a lot so I'm gonna go ahead and
keep that one I also have the Kat Von D
shade + light contour palette this one
was very recently sent to me from a
subscriber as well which was awesome
because this is one that I will feature
in my trying out cult favorite makeup
products to review so I've been testing
it out I've only used it I think about
three times but so far so good I use
this as the contour this is a bronzer
this is the shade that I like to put
underneath my eyes and so far I think
it's working pretty well so do you want
to hold on to this one so I can keep
trying it out and get that review up
next up this was mentioned in my
favorites as well this is the lorac and
Beauty and the Beast a face palette
where you have different blushes and
then also a highlight that has mirror I
know a lot of people say from that video
that goes on HauteLook and they had a
bunch of if either Beauty and the Beast
empires of the Caribbean or both
so outlook could be a place to check out
as well but this was a favorite so I'm
going to go ahead and keep that one this
next one here is from ELF cosmetics and
this is a blush palette this one is I
think it's just called blush palette and
it's in the shade light so inside you
have three different blushes and then I
think this was also considered a blush
but I always used it as a bronzer and
you do have a nice mirror this is a
really nice palette but I can I just
don't reach for it a ton I actually have
an elf do out that I mentioned in my
favorites that I reach for even more so
I think I'm actually gonna pass this
along I'll put it in my pouch mark pile
because I know I did purchase this one
myself but again I just I can't even
remember the last time I reached into it
so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and pass it
on really bad but I just kind of like
tapped areas like hey girl you've been
starring in this entire video so I hate
waking a sleeping dog but she's right
next to me snoring into the camera so I
do apologize about that but next up I do
have this one here from Kevyn Aucoin
this is the making faces beauty book
this is super cool inside you have these
three kind of magnetized pallets
together and each one is a little bit
different so we have the contour the
blush and define and then also the
emphasize eyes so the chapter one for
contour it does have the sculpting
powder which I absolutely adore it has a
highlight and a bronzer and then the
chapter two for blush and define has a
blushes and then also some eyeshades and
then chapter three is just like a mini
I shadow pellet which i think is super
cool so I really enjoyed this one I
reach them to a quite a bit especially
into chapter one for the contour bronzer
and highlight so I do want to go ahead
and hang on to this one up here next
this one is from NARS and this is the
veil palette it's the cheek palette with
a bronzer a blush and then also a
highlight I did get this one sent to me
from NARS and I was really excited about
it because I ended up really enjoying
this one the Laguna bronzer is kind of
like one of those cult favorites so I
was really excited to finally try that
the blush is really beautiful kind of
like a watermelon any type of blush and
I don't have a lot like that and the
highlight was also really really nice I
really enjoyed these can came up with a
separate highlight as well which I was
not as impressed with but the one in
this palette is actually really good so
I'm gonna go ahead and hold onto this
one as well so already so this is what
we have left to kind of smooshed
everything it's together here so this
next one was mentioned in my favorites
this is the Tarte clay play original
palette it's mostly an eyeshadow palette
but I do really enjoyed the bronzer and
contour and here it was also sent to me
from a subscriber this is the color pop
and femme Rosa the color pop and at
Karrueche collaboration the femme Rosa
her face palette I really do like this
one as well except that they shades are
super pigmented see if you go in like a
very very light hand it but it does have
a really nice bronzer blush and
highlight in here so I do want to keep
that one this one was also mentioned as
a favorite this is the elf face duo in
Saint Lucia
so you have a nice either you can use as
a blush or highlight and then also a
nice a bronzer in there so I will be
keeping that one this one is a one of
their aqua infused lines and this one is
in the shade bronzed pink beige so it's
the similar concept you get the mirror
but these are more kind of like the
cream to powder formula and I actually
don't like this one as much I always
kind of tend to gravitate towards the
st. Lucia instead even though I'd like
that this pink is a little bit deeper
the same as with the bronzer shade but I
just don't really reach for cream
products as much so I don't find myself
reaching for this one as much either so
I'm gonna go ahead and put this in my
declutter Poshmark pile because I did go
ahead and purchase that one myself too
so the next up we have this one from
kavanah Quan this is a little like face
palette trio inside each one is a little
bit different so this one here let me
flip to the back so this is the Niel
limelight in Ibiza and then this one is
the setting powder which a lot of you
guys said when I reviewed this one you
said to actually use it as a setting
powder so I'm gonna try the Neo setting
powder and then this last one here is
the Neo bronzer and I really do like
this one's probably my favorite and I
really do use blush bronzer and
highlight out of this one so I really do
like this little trio I thought it was a
cool idea and I kind of like how it all
I kind of magnetizes together like that
so I am gonna go ahead and hold on to
this one as well I like so many Kevin
Daquan products speaking of this is one
that was mentioned in my favorites video
as well this is the contour cookbook
volume 2 the art of sculpting and
defining again inside you have that
sculpting powder which is fantastic
cream bronzer and highlight which I
don't use as much but I do like this
highlight as well and then also it does
have some eye shades in there also so
that was a favorite so I will be keeping
that one and then oh like three of the
last four were all favorites so this one
should be pretty easy to wrap up but
this is the Marc Jacobs this is called
the high five filter or hashtag in Stark
again mentioned as my favorite I really
enjoyed the bronzer but the setting
powder it kind of it looked really
similar to the Wet n Wild and a lot of
people said they were dupes mine are not
color dupes for sure but I really again
I do like the setting powder even more
than I like the bronzer so keep that one
the pure contour Diaries palette again
mentioned as a favorite I get a lot of
use out of these shades in here
especially contour bronzer setting
powder and it does have a nice mirror so
I'll keep that one and then the Becca a
price key glow face palette I have been
raving about this one I know a lot of
you guys have said that you are getting
it on sale I think it's still discounted
to like 44 dollars or something like
that from the original 54 so if it's
still on sale I do suggest getting it I
get use out of every single shade in
here which is awesome and not always
what happens with face palettes
especially with six shades but enjoy
that one big favorites and then this
last one here is from
Larock this one is the collaboration
with Pirates of the Caribbean I did
mention in my favorites video that I
also really enjoyed this one but I liked
the beauty and the beast' even more so
that's why I mentioned Beauty and the
Beast in that video but again I still
really enjoy this one
I really love this blush I think it's so
beautiful and then all of these are
really nice highlights the only shirt I
don't get a lot of use that is out of is
this one it's just kind of like this
weird in-between from my particular skin
tone but other than that I can use all
the other shades and it does have a
mirror as well so I'm gonna go ahead and
keep it that one so after that
that is my declutter and I do not think
I did well in the slightest I don't know
what it is with face palettes and why
they are so hard for me but let me go
ahead and arrange these and I will show
you my different piles of this pile
definitely the largest is my keep pile
with it I believe it's 22 pallets and
then my declutter pile for friends and
family has to and then my posh market
declutter pile has a 4 so clearly and
not the best of clutter that I've ever
done but I'm gonna say it's okay because
my last declutter I did half and half on
both of my concealer and setting powder
collections so I'm gonna go ahead and
give myself a pass on this one but I
will go ahead now and show you guys how
I would add these items to my Poshmark
account so it got my little Poshmark
pile here and then it is an app so I
will have a link in my description box
and if you just go ahead and click on
that link it'll allow you to download
the app it is free and all of that so
that will be down there in the
description box for you to click on if
you are interested in if you do not have
a Poshmark account yet so this is kind
of like an overview of what my closet
looks like again I was saying I have
clothes I have bags on their shoes I
have my makeup on there all of that so
it's kind of like a little overview of
what my closet looks like and then to
add an item all you do was hit sell and
then you would take a picture so I'm
going to go ahead and take this Sonia
Kashuk palette out and I like to take a
few different pictures like I will take
a picture of the front and then I will
also take a picture of the back
especially because it will have that
kind of information on there so I'll
just hit add photo and take a picture of
the back and then of course I want to
take a picture of the inside as well so
people can see what they're getting they
can see
you know kind of the quality of the
shadows that are in there go ahead and
take a picture of that as well so then
you want to go through and add in the
listing details so I would say that I'm
selling the Sonia Kashuk pretty cheeky
palette and then there is real mint to
describe it so I set a face palette with
blush highlight and bronzer it slightly
used a limited edition and that I
purchased it from a target so under a
category I would select makeup and then
it has all of these different items that
you can put in here so let's see I don't
know if they have necessarily face
palettes on here I'm gonna go ahead and
choose blush since it has a blush in
there since they don't have face pellets
and then also you do have to put in a
size and typically for makeup you would
just put in one size and then brand you
can go ahead and search and see if it
would have Sonia Kashuk so it does so
I'll go ahead and click on that color I
don't need to worry about new with tags
is a no so you would put in the original
price like I said it was $20 and then
you would put in your listing price I
typically go at least half and then kind
of just work from there so half would be
ten so I'm gonna go ahead and list it at
eight like it is in really good
condition and I know how lightly it was
used so I don't know to me I feel like
that's a fairly fair price and then it
will also have your earnings in here
that you would receive when it's sold
then you go ahead and click Next and
then you would hit list and it will pop
up on your closet so that will be the
very next thing that is up here on my
closet so it is as easy as that I
mentioned that like I said Poshmark is
sponsoring at this portion of the video
so big thank you to them for working
with me like I said I've been using them
for months now so it was really cool to
get an opportunity to work with them on
a video like this and I thought the
declarer would be the perfect one
because this is what I do anyways and
you know I'm often mentioning in
declutter videos if I'm putting
something on Poshmark
and whatever I can put on Poshmark I do
it after my declares regardless so I
thought that this would be a really cool
video to work on them with said I are
you guys I hope that you enjoyed a new
declutter video my eye shadow pellet
declutter is also coming up very soon
and I know that one's gonna be difficult
as well so I hope you enjoyed seeing
this one I know that I didn't do the
best but I hope maybe you got some cool
information
well about Poshmark in this video I hope
that you enjoyed seeing a new declutter
if you did and you're like the de
clutters please do give this video a
thumbs up I hope that you will also
consider subscribing before you go and I
will catch you guys in tomorrow's video
