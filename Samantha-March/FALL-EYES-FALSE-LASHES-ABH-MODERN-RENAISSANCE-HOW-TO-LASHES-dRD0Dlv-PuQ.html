today's video is going to be a fall
inspired eye makeup tutorial using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills on Modern
Renaissance palette a beginning asked a
lot of requests to do a fall makeup look
using this palette specifically so if
you have most of my face already ready
to go I'm just gonna be focusing on the
eyes because I am going to be taking
some time in this video to talk about
false eyelashes as well I have been
getting so many requests and to do a
false lash video so I thought I could
incorporate it into an eye makeup look
so I'm gonna give some tips and tricks
on applying lashes caring for your
lashes show you how I apply my lashes
talk about some of my favorite lashes
and things like that so hopefully you
guys find that helpful but if you would
like to see my little makeup I like
using at the bottom run sunzha plus some
tips and tricks on the false lashes why
don't we go ahead and get started
alright I do have some a primer on my
eyes so I'm gonna come in to the modern
Renaissance and I'm going to grab out
the first shade which is tempura I'm
going to use the Mota metallic a super
crease brush and then I'm just going to
apply this all over the lid has kind of
that base shade think I want to play
with like some of these red and oranges
so the first shade I'm gonna go in with
is this burnt orange I'm going to use on
morphe 27 it is a really large very soft
blending brush so when I don't want
anything like to like kind of harsh in
the crease this is the one that I've
been reaching for lately so I'm just
gonna pick up some up burnt orange and
just kind of lightly dust that into the
crease
all of these shadows in this palette are
super super pigmented so I'm just gonna
do a really light hand so I pick up the
realgar shade the orange here at the end
this is just a morphe blending brush
from the copper dream set start lightly
and just make sure my brush is really
tapped off and I'm going to first just
kind of Pat that color on the outer part
of my eye and then slowly as I'm getting
a product there I'll kind of start to
flick it outward nothing
too crazy but just kind of start to
flick it outward and then I will also
slowly start to bring it into the crease
and slightly start to blend it inwards
as well
and once I've done that I'm really just
gonna focus on blending on the outer
corner of my eyes so there's no harsh
lines but that's kind of where I want
this color to be mostly focused on the
outside here and then slowly kind of
fading into the inner corner and I grab
an even smaller brush this is the morphe
17 and I'm going to come into red ochre
and I'm kind of gonna do the same thing
here I'm just gonna start to Pat it on
this outer part of my eye I really want
this color to just kind of stay right
here I'm not gonna bring it too much
into the crease yet so that's why I like
using this kind of smaller more precise
brush I'm also not going to use too much
up the red because sometimes it leaves
on me when I use too many like a red
tones it can kind of almost look like
I'm sick so I'm not going to be dipping
back in that one too much I just really
want to play some of it on this outer
part of my eye to give some more
definition to the look and I'm going to
come back in with my first morphe brush
with no additional product and just
blend everything together so for my lid
shade I mean this is probably one of my
favorite shades out of the whole palette
it is called a Primavera and it's just a
really beautiful gold I'm gonna use the
Sigma F 70 it's a concealer brush but I
think it works great as a flat shader
brush and I'm just gonna spray it a
little bit because I really want be gold
to be really popping this I'm just going
to like are you kidding me I love this
shade so much I think it is so beautiful
and I'm gonna focus this one on the
inner part of my eye I'm not gonna
really bring it past you know like maybe
like the 3/4 mark of my eye I'm gonna
leave that for all of the Reds and the
oranges that we have going on I thought
it was really funny that I've been
getting so many requests to use this
palette I mean this is not a
new palette but so many people still
love it
me included I also did get a lot of
requests to use the Jaclyn hill palette
in a fall tutorial so I will also be
doing that so once I have the gold down
I'm going to come in again with my first
morphe brush and just blend everything
together to make sure the gold blends
into these outer shadows out here
because you see like how right here
especially on this eye it's like gold
we don't want that we wanted to look
more blended than that so once I have
those shadows placed down this is
normally when I come in and do my winged
liner and then I would go ahead and put
on my lashes so I'm gonna do my winged
liner off camera because I'm not
fantastic and doing one liner yet and
it's even harder on camera to do I will
say when you are kind of new to doing
false lashes I think having some sort of
eyeliner is important I'm not saying
that you have to have a huge wing out to
your eyebrow by any means because I
don't think that you do but having just
some sort of a liner on the top line it
can kind of help be a guide for your
false lashes and at the same time it can
also help hide the band a little bit so
I typically would recommend if you are a
beginner to false lashes or maybe you
are kind of struggling try throwing down
some eyeliner on your eye because I feel
like that could be a little bit easier
and also not all false lashes are good
for no liner looks some bands just don't
work with no liner I have definitely
found that to be the case some can pull
it off fantastically like the bands that
just just work for not having liner and
I appreciate that but a lot of lashes
you do need some sort of liner down to
help hide or camouflage the band so I
would suggest that so I'm gonna go ahead
and do some wings here with my eyeliner
and then we'll be back to put some
lashes on but once I have my wings on
they are not even at all but that's kind
of another reason why I love false
lashes because like I said I'm not great
at winged liner and sometimes the lashes
can kind of help cover it up a little
bit so so it's not as noticeable but
another thing that I recommend to do is
to put on mascara before you put on your
false lashes it'll just kind of help the
lashes blend a little bit easier
together and it typically don't
recommend
on mascara after you have put on your
false lashes because it'll kind of ruin
the longevity of them and I've said in
multiple of my videos that I use lashes
as many times as I can until they
disintegrate at my fingertips because
lashes are expensive and when you wear
them nearly every single day like I do I
want them to last as long as they can so
I recommend not putting mascara directly
on to your false lashes just put some
mascara on before you pop those on and
it'll help blend together and my next
tip is what you want to do with your
lashes before you actually get ready to
apply them so I'm going to be using it
the blinking for you to Poquette the
lashes today I'm testing these out
because I'm doing a follow-up review
video next week from my first
impressions video that I did last week
so these are what I'm going to be using
today but I want to show you is a brand
new pair of lashes from Pierre cosmetics
these are their diva lashes so when you
open up the box these are what the
lashes would look like and they are huge
I mean really with any set of lashes
like you should have seen how much lash
I had to cut off almost half of the lash
on these blinking beaut lashes because
they are so long typically you are
always going to have to trim your lashes
so to measure out new lashes what you
want to do is when you do remove them
just go ahead and set them on your eye
and you'll want to line it up like where
do you want the outer end to be where do
you want the inner corner to be so after
you place it down you'll just kind of
want to measure it out and then you'll
want to trim your lash always make sure
when you're trimming your lash that you
are trimming from the outer part of the
eye because if you look at an eyelash
you can see on this side the lashes are
shorter and then on this end they are
longer because it's mimicking your
actual eyelashes on your eye I can't
tell you guys how many times I've cut
from the wrong end of my lashes because
it's a freaking lot it is a lot of times
if you've done it you probably just need
to get a new pair of lashes because I've
tried to still rock it and it doesn't
really look that great recommend using a
lash adhesive versus a lash glue I
really don't have
like solid reasons for why I say that
except I've tried adhesives and I've
tried glue and when I use a lash glue
the lash will fall off my eyes I don't
know what it is but every time I've used
any sort of lash glue I've only had
problems so I always get adhesive one of
my favorites is just from duo and these
can be found at the drugstore they are
very affordable either get the dark tone
or they have one that is a clear one
also it comes out white but it will dry
clear I recommend those versus a white
eye lash adhesive because then it dries
white and then it's very noticeable
where these direct darker so it's a
little bit easier to also blend in with
the eye so you do want to put the
adhesive all over the last year and I
try to do a fairly thin layer if you put
it on really thick it's going to take
longer to dry and then there's more
chance that when you put the lash on
that adhesive is there's just going to
be too much of it and it's gonna kind of
like spread all over your eye and to be
really harder to make it look natural
and then I wait about a minute if not
like a minute 30 I know some people say
they only need to wait 30 seconds but I
feel like putting a lash on was still
wet lash adhesive is just like you're
trying to make a deal to double it's
just it doesn't that work for me because
then that's when the idea just kind of
goes everywhere it can go up into your
eyeshadows and it can just be kind of a
disaster
never ever when you put adhesive onto
your lash band immediately go in and put
it on your eye that is a mess it is not
going to be a pretty look you're
probably gonna have to wipe off your
entire eye makeup and start again I do
not recommend doing that you want to
waste the minimum 30 seconds I say
minimum one minute if not a little bit
longer I feel like when you look at the
adhesive you can start to tell when it's
starting to dry when it is starting to
dry that's the best time to apply it
because you don't want it to be
completely dry because then it's not
going to stick to anything you don't
want it to be super wet because then
you're gonna make a mess
so when it's starting to dry that's kind
of the best time and for me with the
dark tone wine kind of see the color
turning a little bit darker and then
that's when I apply it to my eye also I
want to talk about the lash applicator
the one that I use is from Tarte this is
like such a legit like heavy lash
applicator I think it's like 14 dollars
I know I got my alt I think you can get
them
at Sephora as well but I'll link them
down below I used to always use my
fingers to apply lashes or sometimes I
would use like my regular pair of
tweezers but these have really been a
game changer for me if you can see the
actual applicators like it's very flat
and so what I do is I can come in and
grab my entire lash with that lash op
locator and then come in and just boom
set it on my eye it's super easy it's
super handy if you've been struggling
with lashes I recommend at least trying
out at the Tarte lash applicator but
it's really do you think that you should
be able to see a difference using them I
just feel like they're really handy of
this flat edge is something that you
don't get with a regular tweezer so my
tweezer would be holding like the middle
part of my lash and sometimes when my
lashes got so old my tweezers are so
pointy I would go to grab the lash by
the band and I would literally snip it
in half that happened on more than one
occasion that was not very happy with it
so I just hold the lash by the lashes
down here when I feel like my lash is
ready what I'm gonna do is I kind of
start from the top here and I'm just
going to place my lash down before you
place the lash down make sure you
already have it lined up where you think
that you want your lash to go sorry I
feel like I'm like all up in the camera
right now but so I start from the top I
go ahead and line up where I want it and
I just press it down and then I grab the
outer end of the lash with the
applicator and make sure it's down I'm
going to come in with the inner part of
my lash make sure it's down and then I
just start to use my finger and I start
to make sure that it's pressed fully on
to my eye lash is on so that is how I do
it a lot of times I'll wait until I'm
for sure that the he sub is totally dry
and I'll come in with the applicator and
just kind of squeeze the false lashes
and my real lashes together to help it
blend them out even more but that is how
I do it that's how I apply the false
lash right after I got that lash on my
camera out was overheating as I let it
cool down so I just filled in my brows
real quickly the adhesive on I've been
letting it sit for a while I have it
hard to applicator I'm just kind of
holding that full lash there's did the
exact same thing I'm gonna start from
the top I'm gonna kind of look to see
where I want to line it up at and it's
gonna go ahead and set it down and right
as I'm setting it down
I'm already pressing it onto my eyelid
and then I grab the corners and make
sure that those are down
oh man with my finger and just make sure
everything is pressed down usually when
I put the lash on I make sure that the
middle is down first like how I said I
pressed down just press down in the
middle first to make sure that's kind of
like anchor there and then I come in I
sometimes I do the inner corner
sometimes I do the outer corner and then
once those are down I just come through
make sure everything is pressed down
then there we go
second flesh is on so I apply the lash
and hopefully you found that helpful
honestly the biggest thing that I can
say with false lashes and really
learning how to do them is that you have
to practice them I've done this with the
lashes I've done this with winged liner
and I've also done this with brows just
when I'm sitting at home I'm not doing
any other makeup or you know maybe it's
late at night and I'm not doing anything
I just practice and then I go and wash
it off or clean my face off and then I
practice again I mean that's how I've
learned to start to get better at the
three things that I just mentioned keep
them clean my biggest tip is to take the
adhesive off every single time you take
your lashes off when you take a lash off
grab a little pair of tweezers and
really do your best to peel all that
adhesive off your lashes and I clean my
lashes typically what I do is I feel
like a little coffee mug or you know a
small glass eye fill it with like warm
ish water and then I put a very small
amount of coconut oil in there and then
I put the lash in and I kind of let the
lash soak for maybe 20 seconds really no
more than thirty seconds and then I'll
run it under some water to get that
coconut oil out and then I take a
spoolie and you know kind of just
spoolie through the lashes kind of make
them look nice and natural again and
then I put them back into their original
container to let them dry that's how I
clean my lashes before I really started
getting into coconut oil I was just
using water I use coconut oil because I
feel
kind of conditions them as well and just
kind of makes the lashes look a little
like silkier to me I don't know so I'll
do that but typically I mean I only do
that once I've worn the lashes probably
ten times I'll go ahead and give them a
rinse and wash them off but that kind of
helps me keep my lashes going strong and
not using the mascara I mean I think you
can get at least twenty uses out of
lashes if not even more if you if you
just take care of them correctly and
like store them properly and things like
that I definitely think that you can
reuse them over and over my favourite
lashes right now at the moment are
definitely the pure lashes they have six
different styles my favorite styles are
bombshell and diva which those can also
be found at Ulta and then also flirt in
trendsetter those can all the lashes can
be found on the pur website and then
they have three styles right now and it
also so I'll link them down below
I think diva and bombshell and really
even flirt their lashes that you don't
need liner for I think they work really
really well without liners
do you like the huda beauty lashes I
typically wear the style Samantha but
that has a thicker band and you
definitely need liner with those lashes
and I don't think that they're super
beginner-friendly because the band is a
bit bigger when I started out as a
beginner I used the ardell lashes for
some reason now I can't really get on
with them I just I don't feel like they
look super natural on my eyes but they
are very affordable so I would suggest
if you are trying to learn maybe grab a
pair of those from the drugstore and
practice with them I know it has been so
requested I've been seen the comments
come in to talk more about lashes I hope
some of that helped I hope the demo
helped you out some of the tools that I
use and some of my tips and tricks if
you have any questions for me in
particular go ahead and leave them in
the comments below and I'm happy to
answer them hopefully that helped and
why don't we go ahead now and finish off
this eye look I did add a little bit of
the appear on pointed liner at the brown
one on to my waterline so I'm gonna pick
up the morphe M 5:07 it's just a pencil
brush and I'm actually gonna put these
two colors onto my lower lash line warm
taupe and then realgar I'm going to come
in with real guard first start to apply
this across the lower lash line and then
I'm going to take a warm taupe and use
that to really
kinda blend out the real car and then
make it a little bit more smokey as well
because I really enjoy a good smoked out
lower lashline and then coming in with
an even smaller out the morphe 35o
mirror which is a really beautiful
shimmer shade and this is what I'm going
to use in my inner corner and then I'm
also gonna place that right underneath
the brow I'm gonna apply some mascara
just to my bottom lashes eyes are done I
do have the rest of my face on except
for a highlighter and lips I thought we
can do that together
I really wanted to show you guys this
highlight though because I hauled in a
couple weeks ago in one of my live PR
hauls and a lot of people got really
excited over it and I've just been like
waiting to be able to use it and a
tutorial so this is the one from Lancome
it's one of their dual finished
highlighters it's in the shade sparkling
peach sparkling pêche it's spelled P
eche this is sent to me via oxalate so a
big thank you dr. Lee and Lancome for
sending this to me to review but look
how beautiful that is it does have a
mirror here and let me just apply it so
you guys can see I'm going to use the
Sigma f-35 I took off my ears clearly
too early but this is just kind of like
a tapered highlight brush so I'm just
gonna swirl it a bit in there and start
to apply hmmm to my cheekbones oh yes it
is yes it's so pretty so pretty and I am
just I am all about like the more glow
the better these days do you guys
remember when I stopped highlighting and
I was like I'm not really into it
anymore does anybody remember that yeah
I barely remember that I barely remember
that I don't know what happened so I'm
gonna go ahead and make sure you can see
me from space
someone that commented the other day and
they asked how do you get your skin
looking so glossy and I was like I don't
know it might be because I wear eight
pounds of highlight in every single
video then to finish off the look I'm
gonna use this from buxom it's called
under cover it says it's a lip liner and
it has like the product on one end and
then a brush on the other I'm going to
be a rebel I'm not going to use the
brush side and I'm going to use those to
fill in my entire lips and see what it
looks like
I've had it sitting in my you know like
need to review pile for quite some time
and go ahead and see ooh mmm yeah I
think I'm gonna like that color so first
time reason I thought this was gonna be
more nude but it's kind of more of that
almost like like 90s color kind of that
brick it has some like orange undertones
in it too so I feel like it matches that
I look really well so I just really want
to give this a try because I've been
meaning to test it out for quite some
time so that's the buxom it's called the
plump line lip liner it's an undercover
so I'll have that linked down below as
well as well as everything else it's on
my face even things that I didn't use on
camera like my foundation concealer
blush and bronzer and all of that will
be down there but after we do the lips
then this look is complete alright guys
so that is gonna do it for this video I
really hope that you guys enjoyed seeing
a fall inspired makeup tutorial using
the minor renaissance palette like has
been so requested and I also sincerely
hope that some of my false eyelash tips
and tricks and little demo I hope that
helped at least somebody or gave you an
idea that if you do have any specific
questions feel free to ask me in the
comments and I'm happy to get them
answered let me know what else you want
to see for fall makeup looks what other
