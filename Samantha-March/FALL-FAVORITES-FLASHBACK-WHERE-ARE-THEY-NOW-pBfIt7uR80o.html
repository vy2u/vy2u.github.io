today's video is going to be a little
bit different I think I'm going to call
it flashback
fall favorites or something along those
lines but basically what I want to do is
go through my past favourites videos
from both a September and October pull
up the makeup items that I said that I
was absolutely in love with they made it
into my favorites category and just see
where are they now are they still a
favorite do I not use them anymore
one of my thoughts on them it was a lot
of fun watching the old videos and
seeing what were some of my favorites
are from this time last year if you are
ready for a little fall flashback let's
go ahead and get started I've really
been wanting to do some more of these
types of like flashback throwback type
of videos on my channel because we buy
so much new makeup and you know we're
always so excited about all the new
releases and then we kind of like forget
about what's in our collection and I
know people do like the throwback
Thursday and flashback Friday tutorials
I have something up my sleeve coming up
very soon for some of those but I know
those are really popular but I'm trying
to think of ways to incorporate some of
these older items and I thought this
could be something really fun to just
kind of peek back into my old videos
anybody has any other ideas for these
kind of like flashback videos please let
me know because I am all ears right now
I would love some more ideas and I hope
that you guys like this one I thought it
was really funny because when I was
looking at my September favorites from
last year one of the very first items
that I mentioned was this eyeshadow
palette from Tarte cosmetics and
collaboration was styled by haru she was
a celebrity makeup artist I talked about
this palette so much I love this palette
it's one of my absolute favorites
obviously it made it into a favorites
video last year I just put it in my
favorite limited edition makeup video
it's unfortunately no longer for sale I
know someone commented in my limited
edition video and said they randomly
found it in their Ulta it's not on the
Ulta website or the Tarte website but
they found it in Ulta stores which I
thought was really cool and so I thought
that was fun maybe it might still be in
your Ulta but I loved this palette I
still love this palette I take it
traveling with me all of the time it's
one of my absolute staple go to so it's
really funny this one was a win I loved
it last year in September I love
but now in September so yeah tarts I'll
buy hurry oh Sh still one of my
favorites another item and this one may
be pretty tickled when I saw it because
I just used it in my previous and makeup
tutorial this is an eyeliner from
colour-pop it's in collaboration with
kathleenlights and it's the mr. bane
eyeliner I thought it was so funny
because it was only like two days after
I filmed that tutorial then I was
looking up these old videos and I saw
mr. Bing in there and I was like no way
I just used that and a tutorial so
obviously I still in loving on this
eyeliner I really do recommend the
colour-pop liner it's just like I
mentioned in that tutorial video these
are only five dollars and they are some
of the best eyeliners around they're
very creamy they go right on to the
waterline and they really stay there
they are very very long-lasting they
have so many different colors in there
if you love wearing a brown eye liners
which I do I love browning the waterline
check out mr. bang such a good color
this one's definitely still a favorite
of mine that's awesome next up in
September 2016 that I mentioned as a
favorite was the Tarte shape tape oh yes
charge a tape made it into my favorites
last year can you believe that it was
last year that this concealer came out
it's funny too is I think that it would
have been right around September because
I feel like I bought this right away
when it came out I just like concealers
and something that I wear every single
day no matter what so I saw that turret
was coming out the new one I loved her
and I was like I'm gonna go ahead and
buy that concealer and then I was so
happy because everybody lost their minds
and it kept being sold out and I was
like you go girl you already got that
concealer and so I was so excited about
it this one I'm in shade light/medium
and this is almost gone
I need a new one and I will definitely
be repurchasing this one this is totally
still a favorite it's been a favorite
all throughout this year
and that's really awesome to see that it
was a favorite back in September oh yes
heart-shaped day gotta love it
this next one did make me a little sad
though this next favorite that I
mentioned in September was the Lancome
juicy shaker and this was in boomerang I
recently did a lipstick declutter and I
chose to declutter the song I was like
oh me and it made it into a favorites
video and now I'm decluttering it do you
feel like I got some good uses out of it
I really did enjoy it I
like having a lip boil I think this was
one of my first lip oils that I really
got and then I remember I had this one
and then I got a couple other ones and
then I was really liking all of those so
I was able to try a lot but this was
like my original lip oil and I really
did enjoy it I thought it was really
nice when I saw it in the first video I
was like man I should have held on to it
but I was trying so hard to be ruthless
in my lipstick declutter but it is still
really nice lip boil it really is oh we
just had to part ways item that I
featured in my September favorites was a
liquid lipstick this is from the
Smashbox cosmetics in the shade stepping
out oh yes I do love the Smashbox
lipsticks I could have one or two other
shades of the Smashbox lipsticks these
are really really really good very long
lasting liquid lipsticks I remember that
I probably love this shade is so much
especially for September because it's a
really good fall shade like one of those
really deep kind of brown nude it's
really beautiful looks really nice on
the lips very long-lasting these are
more pricey I think they're like $24 but
if you're someone who you really love
liquid lipsticks and you're always on
the hunt for that really good
long-lasting yet not super dry liquid
lipstick I would say check out the
Smashbox one if you like these kind of
like brown nudes check out stepping-out
definitely a favorite color and get in
the favorites video I was like oh yes
this makes me just want to pull it out
again and wear it because I did love
this lipstick last makeup item that I
mentioned in September even last year I
was mentioning other products like
fashion and books and things like that
but the last makeup item that I
mentioned was actually a kit that I
bought from benefit I purchased their
soft and natural brow can I believe it
was from Sephora
it came with a couple different items in
there it came with a goof proof pencil
the high brow pencil and then also the
brow setter and I really did enjoy the
different sets for different items that
you would want and I decided to go with
the soft and natural and I was in the
shade threesome I goof proof-- came in a
three
I had previously gotten the goof proof I
got a sample of it and I got to initiate
two and I wanted to try three and I
thought the three looked better on me
the high brow I don't use as much it's
that kind of like pinkish
to kind of highlight under the brow I
don't do it a ton I typically do it with
eyeshadows so I don't reach for this a
whole lot but the brow setter I do use
this one quite a bit and a nice and
smaller this is a full size but it's a
smaller product and I can take it
traveling with me quite a bit so I
really got a lot of use out of this the
goof proof is like my OG brow pencil I
still reach for this one so often so
that was a good value for me I still
give this one a thumbs up I was very
happy with that so those are all of my
favourites for September of 2016 and
then moving into October one of my
favorites mentioned in there was from
Too Faced and this is the better than
sex mascara and it's still funny too
because I pulled this out the other day
and used it I was like ooh I should
probably throw this away so now saying
that it was a favorite last year I'm
like oh yeah that must that meant I was
using it a lot last year so I really
should throw it away but honestly it's
just there's barely any product looked
in it so I really I used this up this
really is one of my favorite mascaras I
know that I am now on a break with Too
Faced and not purchasing to face at the
moment but I still use their products
and they still have a lot of products
that I really enjoy one being the better
than sex mascara I have gone through
probably like 3 of these 3 full sizes
and I've probably gone through even more
mini sizes I do recommend this all the
time I've recommended it to a lot of my
friends in real life I know they've
bought in this mascara because of me I
just really do like it so it's funny to
see that I was wearing this is so much
last year that it made it into a
favorites video but it still is it's
just a good mascara I can't help it it
just says some more favourites that I
had in October
we're from Sigma so I mentioned the sig
magic brush shampoo and also the Sigma
Express cleaning glove and this is
pretty funny to me as well because I
just had these out I was just cleaning
my makeup brushes they're still there
they're drying right now these Sigma
drying shaped our I believe it's what
it's called so you can put your brushes
in there and dry them but definitely I
still use these all the time my glove is
pretty much just always out on my
bathroom sink I know it drives my
husband crazy but I'm like I use this
everyday it seems so pointless to always
put it in a drawer just to bring it back
out because I do my makeup almost every
single day and I'm constantly cleaning
my brush
so this is awesome you can see in here
that has all these different grooves and
edges on there to clean the brushes and
then same on the other side there's also
like a little handle here if you want to
put your hand in and then you can clean
your brushes that way you can see my
glove is dirty cuz I literally just used
it for all of my foundation brushes that
be dirty
so the glove is awesome they also have a
bigger sized version of it as well and
think magic shampoo this is either my
second or third bottle I'd go through
this quite a bit because again I clean
my brushes a lot and this is one of the
best brush shampoos that I have used and
also 100% natural it's super good for
your brushes because you have to think
about what you're cleaning your brushes
with brushes are going on your face you
obviously want to be using good
ingredients when you do clean your
brushes and the sig magic is awesome for
that so yeah these are definitely still
some of my absolute favorites they're
always that note and then the last item
that I had for a makeup favourite in
October I also mentioned a couple of
Sigma brushes but I love Sigma brushes
that really doesn't change but then the
final makeup item that I mentioned was
the Smashbox photo mat eyes palette I
was obsessed with this palette when I
first got it like obsessed - dirty it
has been so loved
it came with a brush and it's actually a
good brush you don't get that a lot in
palettes but it was a very neutral very
you know basic matte palette it reminded
me a little bit of like the kat von d
palette with all these neutrals in here
but you got a lot of different like
shade options in the Kat Von D I thought
because you had like some pinks there
was a really cool blue over here that I
really enjoyed you still get your blacks
tons of Browns all different shades cool
tone warm tone I mean you just got a lot
of different options in here and I use
this palette so often and I Tru like I'm
trying to think of the last time I use
this palette I know I put it in
favourites videos I put it in favorite
eyeshadow palettes videos like I love
this palette and this is a reason why
I'm excited to do more types of videos
like these to be able to go through my
collection and pull things out that I
remember loving so much because I'm like
I can't remember the last time I used it
because I'm always using the new
eyeshadow palettes and buying the new
eyeshadow palettes and all of these
things like I want to go back
some of my favorites and this definitely
was I need to pull this out again and
play with it because I had so much fun
playing with this and it's definitely
beginner friendly to like this was
really helpful when I was a beginner
very easy shades easy to blend so I
definitely want to pull this one out
again because I had so much fun with it
so the Smashbox photo Matt eyes palette
I'm pretty sure it's still around I
don't think it was a limited edition
palette so I'll link it down below one
of my favorites and I will be using this
again very soon I'm excited to play with
it again so that is everything for my
flashback fall favorites video some of
my favorites from last year September
and October I will link my favorites
videos for September and October down
below in case you want like a flashback
Samantha at all if you would like to
view those videos I'll go ahead and put
the links down below it's so funny to
watch in those old videos and just kind
of see how you grow and kind of how you
get more confident how my background
change and I'll have that fun stuff it's
even funnier when you go even farther
back to when I was filming off my phone
and how different that was oh my gosh
it's so funny but I really want to do
more of these types of videos so let me
know what other ideas you had and what
else I can do because that just got me
like such a fun mood seeing some of the
makeup that I loved and seeing what I
think about it today and if it's lasted
throughout the year and if I still love
it so if you have any other ideas or
suggestions out for me for these type of
flashback videos please let me know in
