today's video is going to be a new
clothing haul and Tryon video I have
some pieces here from fashion nova to
share with you i will be showing each of
the items that i received and then also
insignia some club so you can see what
they actually look like on me I
shouldn't know but did send me a few
pieces and then I also purchased some
myself as well so this is an a sponsored
video or anything
fashion OVA was kind enough to send me a
few items and then I went in and I
purchased a few myself to be able to
show you guys so if you like fashion
nova is a very talked about website do
you have like over 6 million Instagram
followers or something like that they
have a crazy Instagram they have a lot
of items like the website can be a
little bit overwhelming I remember going
in one day and looking at the new
arrivals section and then like two days
later I went looked at the new arrivals
section it was completely different and
I was like whoa so I think they get in a
lot of items very frequently and they
just have like a huge inventory so I
feel like whatever it is that you want
they're probably gonna have they have
clothes they have shoes tops and dresses
and accessories and all that I would say
it tends to be more on like the saucy
side of styling I'm definitely not all
of it but they have some more like
risque pieces they have very trendy
pieces and they tend like that was
probably the word that I would use to
describe fashion ovas like they're very
trendy whatever's on trend right now
they're gonna have it on their website
do seem to be running promos a lot like
on their Instagram they typically have a
lot of sales they did give me a discount
code if you guys want to use it I
believe it's for 15% off and the code is
XO Sam March it's not an affiliate code
for me it's just a discount code for you
so I don't get anything if you were to
purchase with that code but I did want
to throw it out there I'm so like I said
they did send me some pieces and then I
ordered some myself
they have free two-day shipping on
orders over $75 otherwise they have the
the fees for shipping I did do the two
day shipping when I placed my order but
it actually took four days to get here
so I don't know there's that so yeah the
two-day shipping didn't quite work out
and then
I've had some issues I'll talk about it
when I get to these pieces of clothing
but I've had some concerns about some of
the clothing that I received and I
emailed them I emailed the gal that I
was talking to like influencer wise and
haven't gotten any response and then I
emailed customer service as well just to
try to get help because I was confused
on some things and it's been about four
days since I sent the email and I've not
heard anything so that's some pretty
frustrating customer service buzz I
don't really understand that I do have
to return a few pieces which I'll show
you and explain why for their returns it
is you have to return them in 30 days
you know types up to be on and all that
stuff and you get store credit so you
won't get your money back ever if you
need to return something which is pretty
standard I would say for a boutique so
that's not an issue with me
but I do want to make sure to point it
out because some people might not know
that you'll get store credit if you do
need to return anything but you also do
need to pay to return your items which I
don't know that kind of sucks just
wanted to mention that because I do have
to return a few things so I thought I
would throw out the policy I don't feel
like I hear a lot of people talk about
the the little parts of ordering in
fashion videos but that is just kind of
my brief experience with ordering from a
fashion Nova but if you like to see that
items of that I picked out please keep
watching so this is one of my favorite
pieces it's just an Olive sweatshirt but
it's like super distressed all along the
sleeves is distressed material and then
up here as well it's all distressed it
does have a hood and then the hood has
the distress line was I want to say it
was like twenty to twenty-five dollars
I'll try to find everything and linking
down below but with boutiques the
turnover does happen very quickly so
some of the things might not be in stock
anymore but anything that isn't stock
and I can find I will leave it linked
down below I got mine in a size small
and it fits me really well if you like
more oversized hoodies I would say
probably size up but otherwise I thought
it fit true to size but I just really
like it it's super trendy like the
distressed is very on-trend right now
and I just think it's a lot of fun I
love the olive color so I love that my
husband described it
it looks like I was in a zombie attack
and the first day I was wearing it was
the day that the Walking Dead was
apparently coming back on
he watches that I do not and he asked if
I was wearing it to celebrate the
Walking Dead coming back the answer was
no but this is one of my favorites it's
super comfortable and I just really
liked it I've been finding myself
wearing it quite a bit I just think it's
super comfortable and yeah love this one
next piece that I have I'm actually
wearing the top and I try not to do that
when I do my fashion hauls and try ons
because then I like to hold it up but I
completely spaced it and I've just been
wearing this shirt since I filmed like
the actual trial part this morning I
just never took it off really like this
one this is a t-shirt again with the
distress on here it's just black and it
has like little brown splatters all
throughout it does tie at a knot in the
stomach and the front and I really liked
the knot detail
I like the distressed detail I liked
that it was black and kind of edgy this
one I believe was like twenty dollars
and I got this nice small and I think it
fits really well I don't know why I
thought when I ordered the shirt with
the knot in it that it meant like the
knot would never come untied it comes on
tied every time I take this shirt off so
each time that I put it on I do have to
retie the knot I really have no idea why
I thought that would be but that was
something that ran through my mind like
I was like oh oh got a shirt that will
never become a knot it that's not the
case so I want to throw that out to you
but this is another one of my favorites
I can see myself wearing this a ton I
think it's really comfortable as well
super on-trend of course with the
distress detail but yeah I really like
this one as well
but the next item I have is a cardigan
and I apologize because it is wrinkly I
just got it so I haven't had time to do
anything yet about the wrinkles
I like cardigans I think they're really
handy to have around if you just need to
throw something on but they can also
kind of dress up an outfit as well and
this I would say is definitely more
unlike the dressy cardigan side which I
really like I love the color it has the
belt it also has like slits up the side
which I think of it just like an added
effect it hits me just a couple of
inches below my knee so it is pretty
good and length again I just find it
really comfortable a material is a
little bit thicker like it's it's a very
nice material it's a nice cardigan I can
see myself wearing this a lot especially
when we come into spring and like say
I'm just going to like go on run
instead of like putting a coat on I
would throw this cardigan on the this
one I really liked as well I believe
this one was around $25 or so $28 nine
in a size small I would say the sizing
is really well also so again this was
another hit for me the next two items
are where I like ran into my issues I
really wanted to order denim from them
because I hear really good things about
the fashion Nova denim a lot of people I
feel like that's what I'm hearing is
talked about the most from their line so
I was really anxious to be able to try
out some of it and give my feedback and
I look at the reviews like I'm such a
review person i watch the videos I see
that people are saying I read the
reviews on the website so I would say
like 99% of people were saying to size
down when it comes to the jeans size
they run big and that the waist bands
are really stretchy so you can typically
size down I wear a size zero or two in
jeans and so I ordered two pairs of
denim and I ordered each and a size one
which to me is more of my like true to
size and and it did not go well so I
ordered this pair of black jeans and I
don't know if you'd be able to see it
great on camera but they are like really
distressed in the legs I believe these
were like 35 37 dollars and they are
super tiny there is no stretch to them
at all and I can't even get them like
past my knees I mean I can't put them on
I can't try to show you guys I can't do
anything with these because they are so
small and I'm like okay and I guess
maybe if I ordered a size down I
wouldn't be so concerned but basically
the size one is my true to size and if I
can't even get them on to my waist to me
that says I need to order two to three
sizes up which has me completely
confused because nobody is doing that
I've gone back and watched videos I
again have looked at the reviews on the
website I mean I'm just I'm baffled at
this point and this is why I emailed the
customer service because I'm like I'm
super confused can you help me out I did
my
and went up their size chart and again I
got the size of one so I'm confused and
I don't know where things have gone
wrong here but I'm really disappointed
because like I said I was most excited
about these I paid for these with my own
money this isn't what fashion Nova sent
me so now I have to deal with the whole
return thing and I don't know we'll see
how that goes but yeah these jeans I'm
super bummed about because I really
wanted some distress of like denim but
know our fashion Nova jeans so these are
the brands jeans these ones do have a
bit of a stretch to them and I can get
them on but I can't button them so the
fashionable ones do have the stretch to
them but still I can't wear them these
were just like regular dark denim skinny
jeans high-waisted I was really looking
forward to some high-waisted jeans
especially with this top in particular
that I got because that's the crop top I
was looking forward to having
high-waisted jeans around because I
don't have any these for almost 40
dollars I think these guys were $38 and
now I'm like I said I'm just gonna have
to see how it goes return wise with them
I'm bummed because I have to pay for
shipping to send them back and then I
don't know I want jeans I wanted to be
able to try not the fudge and no the
denim and try out their jeans and I also
wanted it for like the particular
outfits that I had in mind to be able to
create with these pieces that I got I
really wanted to send them to work but
now I have no idea I'm just so confused
as to how they're sizing works so I
don't want to pay to send these back and
then try to get new ones and have them
come to me and again they're too small
or I order three sizes too up and then
they're way too big and I'm like I don't
know what to do so I'm very confused I
wish I could get some help from them but
I'm not sure why I've heard also really
good things about their customer service
if they get back to people right away
and it's it's been a long time and I am
guess I'm just gonna stop holding my
breath hoping that they get back to me
because it's not happening so I don't
know I might just use my store credit
and get more tops or something like that
I don't I don't really know for sure yet
but maybe someone will get back to me
and I'll be able to figure it out but if
you guys have purchased from fashion
Nova and if you have advice on their
debt
and what sizes to do please let me know
because I'm completely confused at this
point my experience both with the
fashion Nova brand and the other brands
that they carry on the website I would
not say to order down and I wouldn't say
it's even ordered true to size you'd
probably have to size up because like I
said I really did want these pieces so
I'm bummed out about it and I just don't
want to waste a lot of money and time
shipping back items and then still
getting incorrect sizes so I don't know
if you guys have any advice please do
let me know because I would I would love
to have that but yeah unfortunately the
denim both denim pieces that I got did
not work out for me so I will have to be
you returning them I really wanted to
try out some boots right now the over
the knee boots are very on trend so I
picked up this like camel color brown
suede type of boots they do have a
little zip right here that goes this far
you do have a pretty good heel on them
and they are very like like your foot
you know I was like doing one of those
like after and I have dancing your feet
or the heard of these shoes but I really
don't mind because I think they are
super cute they also do tie in the back
and I try to make my pretty tight
because they're pretty loose around my
thighs so I try to tie my pretty tight
but I actually love these umm I am very
happy with them I really like them I
think these were a little bit more
pricey these might have been more around
like the $40 mark really liked them I
thought they were super on-trend I am a
little confused though because on the
website they looked like they were not
this color at all and I actually like
this color I'm glad that I got it but
online in the photo it did this color
did not look anything like it I remember
when I pulled these shoes out I was like
what are these and then I saw him I was
like oh okay so I actually like these
better than what I thought I was getting
but I would say to make sure to pay
attention to the colors as well because
sometimes the photos that they have like
you'll see like a pink top and then when
you actually click on it it says red and
it's like oh okay because we're
definitely different color than what
they were in the photo but I love these
I'm super excited and I think they go
really well with the two final tops and
I'm going to show you guys I love how
these pair with them so I'm really happy
to have these so this top I just got so
I still have the tag on it
I got mine in size small this is $24.99
this is the give me some
space address so it's just a new dress
and it has the tie up feature in the
front is like a shorter dress but I like
to pair it with the over-the-knee boots
and I thought just like the color scheme
and how it looked together I really
loved it I love the tie up front again
that's like super on-trend right now
Tyrael is a little bit different I'm not
sure exactly I don't know my materials
really well so I'm not sure exactly what
it's made out of but it's definitely one
that I feel like could wrinkle very
easily so I really wanted to be careful
with that like this isn't one that I
would just like throw on the floor not
that I do that with any of my clothes
ever but I feel like this one could be
prone to wrinkles really well so I'd
have to take care of that but yeah I
really liked it and I thought it fit
really well it's a little bit longer
than I thought maybe it would be but
otherwise it fits very well everywhere
else and yeah I really like this one too
a last item that I ordered is this
oversized hoodie it's like a new type of
hoodie but I loved it because it has
this really cool detail right here this
kind of like lace tie up on the shoulder
and I just thought that was a super cute
and super eye-catching it does say that
it's oversized I ordered a small which I
probably could have done an extra small
and still been fine like the oversize
aspect of it does have the hood of
course as well and then some ties right
here but I just thought that detailing
was super unique and really fun so you
can tie it I usually tie it in a bow but
I'm just from like the couple of times
that I've tried it on and tried to put
it into a bow it falls out very quickly
just so you know but I believe this was
$30 again I ordered the size small very
oversized very comfortable very warm and
really liked this piece as well I
thought it was more of like an
attention-grabbing piece especially with
just that detail right there and then
this paired with over-the-knee boots as
well I just think it's such a cute
outfit I love like the oversized
sweaters or even like sweater dresses or
things like that and then to pair them
with the over-the-knee boot I just think
is super cute so I think that's a really
fun outfit and I'm excited to wear it
but I did like this piece also and then
after this one this is the final item
that I got from a fashion Nova ok so
that's going to be everything for my
nova clothing haul and Tryon video so
the majority of items that I got I
really did like what was I like six out
of eight which i think is good I tried
to get different pieces so that I could
review the different items for you like
the you know more regular sweaters
cardigans hoodies shoes and then also
denim the denim of course Network out
but everything else I thought was really
good I was I will say that I liked the
quality of the items that I've tried so
far when I was reading the reviews I saw
like a lot of people are saying that
they were comparing them to like some
like not as high quality brands so I was
a little bit worried but I thought
everything was really good quality I
wouldn't say it's like super excellent
designer quality but you're also not
paying that price I think the prices are
all pretty fair it can get a little bit
pricey depending on what you want but
again they always seem to have some sort
of sale or discount floating around as
well and again I do have a 15% off code
they don't have one at the time you're
watching and you really won't order
something you can get 15% off with the
code I suppose they have marched up to
I'll leave in the description box too
but I was you know really happy with the
majority of things I got the shipping
that when I actually placed the purchase
for myself the shipping wasn't today
shipping which was kind of a bummer but
again it was free because I spent over
$75 I think that's kind of like been
bumming me out is that I can't get help
from the customer service so I'm kind of
not sure what to do under that I think I
had a pretty good experience I'd love to
know I hope you guys ordered anything
from fashion Nova what's your experience
been like do you have any advice on the
denim I would love to know please leave
it in the comments below if you did but
other than that that's gonna wrap it up
for this video I hope that you enjoyed
this clothing haul and try out if you
want to see more of these videos please
do give this one a thumbs up I hope that
you will subscribe before you go and
thank you so much for watching and I'll
