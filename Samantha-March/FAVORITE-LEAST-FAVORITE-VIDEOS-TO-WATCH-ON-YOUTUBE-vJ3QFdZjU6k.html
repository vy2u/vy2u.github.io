today's video is gonna be a little bit
different kind of a chatty video but I
saw a couple of weeks ago my friend at
Kayleigh did a couple videos talking
about her favorite YouTube videos to
watch and also her least favorite
YouTube videos to watch and I thought
that was such a fun idea so that is what
I'm gonna be talking about today some of
my favorite style and types of videos
that I enjoy watching and that also I
don't enjoy watching I will have
Kaylee's video linked down below if you
haven't seen her yet I highly recommend
you go check it out and her channel as
well but if you would like to see some
of my favorite types and least favorite
types of YouTube videos to watch when we
go ahead and get started so I just
turned it down a little list here so I
could go through it I don't know if I'll
talk about everything on the list
alright kind of just want to hit like
some of my most favorites and then some
of like my least favorites to watch
because there's obviously so many
different types of videos and categories
and things like that that we could get
here forever but I really didn't think
this was a fun idea because a lot of
times when people do a Q&amp;amp;A look at
youtubers doing a Q&amp;amp;A and they say
something on Twitter like send me
questions for a Q&amp;amp;A one of my questions
that I frequently ask is what kinds of
videos do you like to watch on YouTube
so I'm just curious like what what do
people like to see and not only in the
beauty community too but I don't watch a
ton of different types of videos on
YouTube but I'll chat about like one
main other genre of YouTube videos that
I watch but it's just interesting to see
what other people watch and you know
we're all curious there's that but one
of my favorite videos to watch and of
course these videos everyone's gonna be
really different and have different
opinions so I mean obviously I don't
feel like I have to say that but still
people get angry when you don't like the
same things they like but I feel like my
first one is one that a lot of people
don't like and I know a few other people
haven't done this video since Kaylee did
hers and I think almost every single
person that I've seen has put this and
their videos that they don't watch and
that is makeup tutorials but I love
makeup tutorials and I love watching
makeup tutorials I currently have a
video cued on my laptop right now
watching a makeup tutorial I really
enjoy tutorials they are what I first
found when I first started watching
YouTube and I was like a YouTube late
bloomer
I got reckon
at Carli bybel from the gal who was
doing my makeup for my wedding and I was
like right and I started watching
YouTube videos and it helped me so much
because I was always that girl who loved
makeup and I loved buying makeup and I
loved looking at makeup in the stores
but then I would get home and have no
idea what I was doing and every time I
would try to recreate something on like
I would see a picture and I would try to
recreate it
horrible horrible I really don't have a
lot of artistic talent and I don't have
an artistically creative mind so I can't
see something and recreate it I need a
step-by-step broken-down tutorial of how
to do it so I love makeup tutorials and
one question that I get asked a lot is
how do I put looks together how do I put
color combinations together how do I
side when I look in an actual ippolit
what colors I'm going with it's not me
it's the makeup tutorials I watch they
are 100% what gives me the inspiration
what gives me the the confidence to try
different looks and there are so many
times where I get ready to do my makeup
and I'd go back to you know a video I've
already seen I've already watched it I
go back to that video and I watch it and
I pause and I repeat and I watch it and
hit pause and I repeat it on the other
and like I love makeup tutorials and I
hope people don't stop doing them
because they are so so helpful to me I
like watching hauls and I'll say here
that there's types of hauls I like to
watch and then there's types of hauls
that I've kind of noticed lately that I
don't like watching I like watching
hauls to see what people are excited to
buy and to see what they are okay
parting their money with does that make
sense to it I even say that correctly I
don't know if that came out right but I
just mentioned this on my latest YouTube
live chat and kind of something that
I've noticed is that I'm kind of tired
of the halls where people are just going
out to buy makeup to buy makeup to
review it and to have it on their
YouTube channel super fast like I'm just
kind of over that because I feel like
when I'm watching the hall I really want
to see why that person bought that
makeup what got them so excited about
that makeup and you know what they were
willing to spend their money on because
makeup is expensive
and drugstore makeup that's expensive or
even if you're placing an order from
colour-pop but you're buying five
different things you're starting to get
expensive you know what I'm saying and
so I'm just kind of over the constant
need to have the newest newest products
and to have your review I'll get to that
soon but have your review within two
hours of you buying the product just
because you want you know I feel like to
me it comes back to like wanting the
view is right away and I totally
understand that mentality and I had that
mentality when I first started my
YouTube channel and I got into the
beauty side of things I was like oh my
gosh I have to have all of the new
makeup releases right away and then I
have to put them on my channel right
away like that's that's that was my
understanding of how you grew a channel
and I think that's completely incorrect
and at least it's the way that I don't
want to grow my channel that's that's
not what I'm interested in you might
know that when people just go out and
buy an entire collection of stuff just
again once again just to have it on
their youtube channel and it's sometimes
it's really disheartening being a part
of creator groups like Facebook groups
or Instagram groups where you know you
have your little group of youtubers or
bloggers and people chat and the number
of times I hear people say you know oh
you know I I'm I buy a lot the new
makeup because a question was posed one
night how do you buy so much makeup how
do you buy all of these new releases it
is so expensive and multiple people
wrote in and said well yeah we buy all
the new releases and review them and
then we return them and get our money
back and I'm like no I want to see I
want to see halls where people are
excited for what they got they actually
want that they actually want that in
their collection like yes I returned
makeup if makeup doesn't work out for me
if I buy it and it doesn't work out for
me
I will return it because why would I
keep it but I have never I have never
bought anything with the intention of
returning it just put it on my youtube
channel
return it I've never done that and I
hope that I would never have that
mindset because I just think that's
weird and I feel like it's kind of
misleading as a youtuber I honestly feel
like it's a little bit misleading to
your audience because if I see you buy
something in my mind that's telling me
you got excited about it you really
wanted to
try it for whatever reason it was like
and there's different reasons you know
people have different reasons for why
they want to try things like some things
I'm just darn curious about it I want to
see if it works or I want to see how it
works for me or something like that but
I don't know so I like watching halls
but specific types of halls I don't like
seeing just Hall to Hall makeup to have
it makeup to put it on your channel like
that's not what I meant to so that's
kind of like a like and just like oh and
one but hopefully that makes sense
because sometimes it just it just feels
so disingenuous sometimes when you see
certain halls or reviews or things like
that it's just kind of like hmm no no I
also really like watching like unique
chatty videos and the video said I feel
like I do a lot the video like this I
feel like Kaylee had such a great idea
with this type of video um you know I
like coming up with I like finding fun
ideas to talk about because I am NOT a
tutorial based channel and I really have
Jessica Braun to thank for this Jam
Beauty 89 cuz one day I was watching her
on snapchat and this was a several
months back but she made a comment about
not being a I think was on her snapchat
it might have even been in a YouTube
video but she made a comment about not
being a tutorial based Channel and she
just likes to talk about makeup and I
was like that's what I like too but I
felt having a beauty channel you had to
do tutorials too and I was like I want
to do more tiny bit like that's what I
want to be known as like the girl who
talks about makeup the girl who reviews
makeup like that is what's fun to me and
that's why I started a channel I didn't
start a channel to do tutorials because
I was still learning from the YouTube
tutorials and so I was something about
when she said that it just clicked in my
mind and I was like that's what I want
to do more of and I like reviewing but I
also like coming up with the fun ideas
like like the video I did recently was
makeup products I won't pay full price
for like products I still really like
products I'll still buy but I gotta have
some sort of discount on there like I
feel like videos like that are super
interesting and it's fun to come up with
unique ideas and those are really the
types of videos that I gravitate towards
I really like watching them I like
coming up with the ideas I think it's
really fun it's a video that I feel like
is one
a lot of other people said they don't
like but I really do like watching is
first impression videos but I really
like first impression videos to have
follow-up videos because I like to see
how things work out and I think since I
realized that I like watching first
impression video so much I like doing
them more like I just did two first
impression Friday's back-to-back weeks
I've done other first impressions and
you know within the last month or so but
I like doing them because I feel like
it's kind of fun to see a raw reaction
like you don't know how something's
gonna work it could go terribly wrong
like the other day I come figure out my
Charlotte Tilbury Foundation I opened it
for the first time on camera and I was
like what I opened it incorrectly and
you saw my face like I left it all in
there like wait what what what is
happening here like I kind of like that
raw first impression I feel like it's
funny in but I also like I said I like
getting the follow-up review and it's
kind of interesting to see did you
really like it as much as you thought
you were going to in the first review or
not or you didn't like it in your first
review but you know what you've changed
your mind you actually did like it I
feel like those are interesting but it's
always still fun to see the reactions
because I feel like it's you know kind
of like I'm break up to trial ish but
it's a little bit more on the laid-back
side and it's just fun it they're just
fun for me to watch so that's why I've
been filming more and lately I really
try to film the videos that I like to
watch too because of course and that
just means that I have a lot of fun
doing them so yeah I really do like
watching first impressions I favorite
video I really like watching are the
monthly favorites I just like them
because they're full of reviews and I'm
like a review junkie I want to hear the
reviews about everything I want to see
what people are loving I really like how
I do the makeup monthly because I trying
to talk about favorites fails and
everything of its Wayne and I know my
friend Katie Murray and talked to that
one too when she started her YouTube
channel but I was so excited when I saw
it all like yes yes because I just love
like I just love long review videos and
people want to tell me about a lot of
different products I like soak it all in
like a sponge of like tell me tell me
about all the makeup you've been trying
I just think they're super interesting
so I like seeing those I also really
like watching clothing hauls I can watch
clothing hauls like all day long I watch
a lot of clothing calls as well I don't
do them a ton on my channel but I really
enjoy watching them and I also like
watching like a recommendation videos
like right now of course
we're getting a ton of like gift guides
and I look up and watching all of them
gift guides for him even yeah watching
those two trying to get ideas for like
my husband and stuff but like the
Sephora vib sale recommendations I love
watching the Ulta 21 days of beauty I
love seeing what people are excited to
buy and what they would recommend I
think those are so much fun and they're
some of my favorite videos to do as well
the other video that I really like
watching that has nothing to do with
Beauty are dance videos and I think his
name is Matt though his last name starts
with an S I guess I don't probably
wouldn't be able to say it right but he
has such amazing dance videos and he
also has dance tutorials in there but
every time a new video pops up I just
get so excited I love dance I love music
I love it also to just sit and watch
these people dance I'm like definitely
what I look like at the club I know that
for sure
so those are some videos that I really
like watching let's see on my don't like
list I have I literally wrote this down
not real reviews the first thing I wrote
on my list but it just really does
bother me when I see a product that has
just come out and then like a day or two
later there's all these videos this is
my review I'm like you just got that it
just released like unless you got it
early in PR like then I can you know
understand but then you know you click
on the video or start watching it and
they're like I just bought this
yesterday now let me tell you my full
thoughts and my full review on it I'm
like that's not fair that's not your
phone repute like those just drive me
crazy because I just feel like they're
not real and I feel like they're not
actually helpful information I really
heard people say I had so far I have
tried three shades out of this palette
but I'm gonna tell you my full review
and I'm like no you're not that's not a
full review oh my goodness it just it
drives me a little bit crazy but it kind
of goes back with like one of us talking
about what the halls and just like
buying to put the review video up right
away it just it doesn't actually help me
out to see someone review a palette or
foundation when they've tried it one
time when they tried it two times though
even though like I have a bunch of new
eyeshadow palettes in my collection I
have a whole bunch of them I like doing
the first impressions
with them but I will come back and try
them I will try them all for at least
like a two-week time period but I would
say 5 to 6 plus times trying them trying
you know different primers and different
brushes and different colors and
different color combinations and seeing
how long they last like that to me is a
more helpful review like yes people are
getting their reviews of super super
early but I just how how helpful is this
mean so it's like I understand that I'm
late with my reviews a lot but I would
rather be late with my review and give a
good in-depth honest review on something
than to just throw up the video right
away just to have it up and like cross
my fingers and hope use will come in
that's just not how just again I feel
like you're doing a disservice to the
people who are watching your channel and
relying on you and trusting your opinion
when that happens it just I don't know
it's just something that's been bought
and like as a I would say like just the
past couple months - it's just something
that I've seen that just kind of bothers
me and again because being in those
creator groups and you kind of get up
behind the scenes and you see what other
people are doing it just kind of makes
you like it just makes you stop and
think I understand fully
I am a youtuber I have a YouTube channel
I would like my youtube channel to be
successful and that would be amazing
but I still consider myself a youtube
subscriber first by YouTube viewer first
that is what I consider myself first and
foremost and sometimes you feel like
channels are kind of like dumbing us
down as subscribers because we're like
well you can't say that you try
something once and you're reviewing it
like don't drive like me that way you
know other videos that I really don't
like our videos that tell me that
they're gonna give me an honest review
where did this come from why did this
have to start happening because I feel
like I've noticed it in the past like
couple months here like I don't know
three or four months but all of a sudden
everybody's telling us that they're
gonna give us an honest review and I'm
like
shouldn't that be implied shouldn't we
already know that what did you not give
us a nice review before why is this one
honest if you don't put honest review on
your next video is that one honest like
I don't understand why this happened and
why we have to tell people we're being
honest like I should just be imply with
the subscribers and the people who are
coming to watch your channel I really
don't understand that at all or the
videos that are like you know the omg's
and all of that I'm like like just the
like the such clickbait titles a lot of
times I've just found myself not even
clicking on them anymore cuz I just like
I just I just can't it just doesn't make
any sense to me I don't know why we have
to do that or even videos that are like
is this the best lipstick ever of life
is it I'm like I don't know and I don't
really care like just tell me what your
video is going to be instead of saying
like oMG is this the best the world's
best the this best I'm like just just
tell me what your video is gonna be
because then I can decide if I watch it
but if your entire title it's just like
OMG honest review whoa I'm like of what
what are you doing what are you talking
about am I gonna want to watch this
video I don't know because I don't know
what oMG means no I I don't know I don't
know what that means I have a college
degree don't know what that means my
next one of those clickbait titles or
thumbnails they're like yeah I feel like
that's pretty self-explanatory but I
really get bothered I remember the very
first time I ever um subscribed to a
YouTube channel on this was like last
year - you're I don't even remember how
long ago it was but it was a while ago
but I can remember vividly the first
time I unsubscribe to a YouTube channel
because I felt terrible about it like
I'm that person that even if I stopped
watching a channels videos it takes me
even longer to unsubscribe a lot of
people to follow one subscriber behind
like it makes me feel bad like yes I'll
stop watching the videos but I'll still
hang on unless something really bothers
me but the very first time I ever done
subscribed to a YouTube channel it was
because this person was doing a Q&amp;amp;A and
but I didn't know that because the title
didn't say that the title says something
like last YouTube video like goodbye
YouTube you know basically insinuating
this is their last YouTube video they're
gonna be done after this and I remember
I was at a friend's house even like
having dinner and it popped up on my you
know like I got a little alert like oh
this person posted
video and I was like I just started
watching this channel friendly recently
like I really liked this channel oh my
gosh and I'm watching it and it turned
out to be a QA and one person asked at
one point like would you ever stop doing
YouTube and they're like moving on I was
like so your title had asked anything of
course the thumbnails like and I'm like
oh my gosh something happened no 100%
clickbait and I was like unsubscribe I
was so mad you got me fired up I left
dinner
I left the dinner table at my friend's
house to watch your video because I was
so concerned and you lie to me you lie
to me dude
I also don't really enjoy like the PR
unboxings but specifically just the PR
unboxings that tell me how much money
things are worth
I'm very weird when it comes to money I
also don't like seeing people say like I
spend a thousand dollars at Sephora
here's what I bought because I'm like
can you keep that information I don't
know I guess I'm the person that's like
I feel like you should keep that info to
yourself but to me it's the same like
just the other day we were out and about
and this girl made a comment about her
raise that worked like someone in my
real life she made a comment about her
raise at work and like said the exact
amount of money that was the raise and
it's like I don't know if that's a lot
to you or not a lot yeah like I don't
know if that's good or bad because I
don't know your personal situation so I
couldn't gauge her cuz I want it to be
like congratulations are no shoot
it's like I don't know everybody is so
different with our financial situation I
just just think it's weird to be like
throwing out money and figures and
numbers all the time it's just I don't
know it's something about me you know
this is me in my opinions here in this
video but to me is just weird so when
someone's like I spent a thousand
dollars at Sephora I just want to be
like don't maybe don't say that I don't
know it just kind of like bothers me and
so with the PR unboxings like I don't
mind PR hauls
I mostly do mine either on Instagram
stories now or I do them in live chats
but I don't really do like just regular
videos as PR hauls because I've been
kind of finding myself like not enjoying
them as much but I feel like it's
because all of a sudden I feel like
again this has been an influx in the
past couple months where the thumbnails
are like like the little girl like
sitting amongst all of these boxes and
it's like one
dollars worth of PR and I'm like oh like
it just kind of rubs me the wrong way
you know so I'm like I don't really like
that I think it's I think it's I think
the word tacky is what I'm looking for I
just think it's a little bit tacky and
like not very professional which I mean
it's YouTube so I mean I don't know but
I don't feel like that's very
professional I don't and I stopped I
stop dodging them I'm not interested in
them at all
a couple more left on the videos I don't
personally enjoy watching but I also do
not watch drama channels I really don't
have a lot of interest in them and I
remembered not even really realizing
that they were out there like I have my
channels that I love and I watch and I
watched so many channels I totally
utilize my watch list and usually at any
given point in time there is at least 60
videos on my to watch list and sometimes
like there's a weekend where I'm out of
town and I don't watch a lot of YouTube
it gets past a hundred videos so I am
always you know trying to watch videos
as fast as I can and support my other
friends but then of course watch the
videos that I really want to watch and
the reviews and the tutorials that I
want to watch so I I don't really pay
attention a lot to what else shows on my
homepage so I don't know if I ever just
missed those channels but I remember
actually bringing it up one time in a
live chat because so many people were
talking about different things and the
live feed and I was like how do you guys
know all these things about like
different influencers are just like
different things in the be in the beauty
community and I'm like how do you guys
know all this information and they were
like the drama channel's tell us and I'm
like oh no wonder I always go so like
left out or like out of a loop like I
don't know what's going on but I'm just
ya know I just really don't take an
interest to them because and I know some
people were saying that some of them are
actually not just like for the drama or
to come after people personally I think
that's something that really bothers me
is when people come after someone else
they're like their personal life or the
people around them that really really
irks me but some people were saying you
know they have like good information or
things like that and I was like yeah
okay maybe like I'll try sometime I said
I haven't done again because I'm just
not interested enough in it but I don't
know I just feel like I don't think that
they do
much good like I'm that person that
always tries so hard to preach
positivity and I just feel like it would
be really backwards if I then watch
drama channels and people tearing each
other down and talking about their
personal lives and things like I just
feel like I would be not truthful to
myself because I'm always trying to talk
about positivity and how to do good and
then like I'm secretly watching drama
channels like thank you my popcorn like
you guys know skittles not popcorn but
that's I don't know I'm just not
interested in them I don't watch them
and then the last one I had on my list
is hack videos just like not interested
in tags I know that was a really big
thing especially when I first started
getting on YouTube it was like everybody
had hacks for everything and I would
watch the videos and I was like yeah
okay and then I felt like I had to hack
videos and I think maybe I've done one
or two like I think I've done one hack
video and then like one like trying out
hacks and just both of them I was like
this is not fun I don't like doing this
oh really third of any added benefit to
me like I don't feel I don't really feel
anything for hack videos so those are
ones that I'd just kind of pass over and
I know people still do them but luckily
the craze like when I first started
watching YouTube everybody was doing
them like all the time and I'm kind of
glad to see that kind of wood away cuz I
was like that wasn't really helpful for
me personally of course there's probably
some of you that love watching hack
videos but after the hack videos of
that's gonna do it for my youtube videos
that I enjoy and not so much enjoy
watching
I guess those give me everything for
today's video I hope that you guys
enjoyed this video and learning a little
bit more about me and what I like and
dislike in the YouTube land I would love
to know in the comments below like what
are some of your favorite videos to
watch do we have anything in common
something I don't like watching is that
like one of your favorite things and you
never miss those videos I would love to
know it's like I said I feel like
especially with some of them that I
mentioned like tutorials and first
impressions I feel like so many people
say they don't like watching those
videos and I do so hey we're all
different it's all good but I would love
to know your feedback as well and of
course if you haven't checked out
Kelly's video yet or her channel I will
have this link in my description box
thank you for such a fun idea I really
enjoyed this one and if you guys did
enjoy this one I hope that you will give
it a thumbs up I hope that you will also
consider subscribing before you go and I
look at you guys in
