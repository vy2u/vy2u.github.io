today's video is going to be some of my
favorite limited edition items this
video has been requested several times
over in the past couple of months here
so I've had it on my list to do for
quite some time but I'm gonna walk you
through a blue I have seven different
items than our Limited Edition that are
my absolute favorites it's really
interesting to me to see this one being
requested so much because a lot of times
with limited edition people buy it and
then they kind of quietly put it away
because limited edition can be hard to
use and things like makeup tutorials a
lot of us tend to shy away from them
because people get it said if they
weren't able to get them or you know
they're not available to purchase
anymore or they sold out too fast they
weren't able to buy them at the time
that they launched so it can be kind of
frustrating and I totally get when the
comments were coming in and people
saying I have all this limited edition I
never hear anybody talk about it anymore
or anybody use it anymore share some of
your favorites with us so that is what
I'm going to do today and I hope that
you guys enjoy this video
if you'd like to see seven of my
favorite limited edition products that I
have in my collection
why don't we go ahead and get started
like I said I have seven different
products here they're either eyes shadow
palette or face pallets those are kind
of what is most typically limited
edition I think in the makeup world and
the first one that I want to talk about
if you are not new to my channel you
should totally have expected to see this
one in here is from Tarte cosmetics and
this in collaboration with style by her
Rouge who is a makeup artist this is one
of my absolute favorite palettes so this
is what the packaging looks like you
open it up inside you have a mirror you
have six different eyeshadows and then
you also have a blush I love this
palette so much it has made it into so
many of my videos this was one that I
was like yes I know it's limited edition
it actually stuck around for quite some
time and is no longer available and you
aware that I could find but I feel like
this one stuck around for awhile and I
just kept recommending it and kept
recommending it and I kept saying I
still see it on alta go buy it and I
know quite a few people who told me that
they did buy the palette which made me
really excited but I take this traveling
with me so much it's really small and
compact so it's easy to travel with it
has the mirror and has beautiful matte
eyeshadows but it also has shimmers that
I think are really pretty and this blush
which is called cheeky is absolutely
gorgeous I do love the Tarte blushes and
I think the
in this palette is so beautiful so this
definitely was one of my favorite
limited edition items if they were to
ever bring it back I would highly
recommend you get it but as of right now
this one is sold out completely but talk
about one that is still in stock right
now this is from BH Cosmetics in
collaboration with Carli bybel Carli
bybel is a youtuber he actually did a
collaboration with BH Cosmetics last
year and it was a really similar palette
to this I actually have it or should
have pulled it out it was a really
similar palette to this but it was just
a little bit smaller and I think it had
great success so they decided to come
back and make the deluxe edition so this
palette in particular has 21 shadows and
then they also have highlighters so when
you open it up you do get a really nice
mirror there which I was very impressed
about then you have all of these
different beautiful eyeshadows and then
all of these beautiful highlighters the
highlighters are right here on the
bottom and then you have the eye shadows
on top this palette is absolutely
gorgeous I love - the first palette I
have raved about that one as well that
one is now completely out of stock you
can no longer get the smaller palette
but this palette is still for sale
I believe it's available on BH Cosmetics
and I did check Ulta as well it is still
available there and it's only $22.50 for
all of this this is a very large palette
to get for only 2250 very impressed by
that I'm impressed with the quality of
the eyeshadows they're very beautiful
that blend easily they're quite
pigmented I really enjoy them and then
the highlighters though like the
highlighters are freaking bomb in this
palette and like these two over here a
little bit too dark for me I've used
them as eyeshadows but these are
absolutely gorgeous and these two
especially are my absolute favorite from
this palette for the highlighters they
are super cool so if you are looking for
a fantastic I shadow and highlighter
palette but at a great price I highly
suggest the BH Cosmetics and Carli bybel
palette of course with this video this
is a limited edition palette so I will
be gone at some point so I highly
suggest you pick yours up before that
happens I have to face palettes here
from lorac that I want to talk about the
first one is their face palette from
their Pirates of the Caribbean
collection the entire Pirates of the
Caribbean collection is a limited
edition right now I do still see this
available on the lorac website I don't
see
available anywhere else pretty sure none
of the pirates of the carribean
collection was available on Alta anymore
but some of the items not all of them
some of them are still available on the
lorac website including the cheat
palette which i think is a phenomenal so
inside you do get a mirror and then you
have six different shades here so this
is what the palette looks like and these
are absolutely gorgeous I can't remember
getting the Pirates of the Caribbean
collection sent to me from lorac which
was super exciting it was the first time
I was getting a package from lorac
cosmetics which had me so excited and I
was pumped for that eye shadow palette
but I actually ended up loving this face
palette even more and I continually
reached for it the only shade in here
that doesn't work for me is this one up
here which is called lost soul it's just
kind of like a strange in-between color
for me it doesn't work as a blush it
doesn't work as a bronzer doesn't work
out the Condor and it doesn't really
have a lot of shimmer to it like it
would be a highlight but all of the
other ones are absolutely beautiful this
is a fantastic blush in it and I think
I'll be reaching for that one more as
fall comes around but all of these
highlights are insanely gorgeous and
insanely pigmented and almost like
metallic they are just so beautiful I
was highly impressed highly impressed
with this cheek palette it will be gone
from the lorac cosmetics website soon
though so I suggest if you want to get
this one you pick it up quickly
another one from lorac cosmetics this is
from their Beauty and the Beast
collection which of course is a limited
edition collection and this one is the
cheek palette as well so similar a bit
to the Pirates of the Caribbean one it
opens up with this it has a mirror and
then you have four different shades in
here and while the one for the pipes of
the Caribbean was mostly a highlighter
based this one is actually more blush
based so the four different shades look
like this so you have three different
blushes and then you have a gold
highlighter right here this highlighter
is absolutely stunning I actually pulled
out this palette and worn all weekend I
was traveling a bit over the weekend it
was gone from my house and when I was
choosing what makeup to bring I was like
you know what I freaking love this
palette I still adore it the blushes are
also beautiful but that gold highlight
is right now there are a few items from
the Beauty and the Beast collection
available at Ulta but they are selling
out one is still only available on the
lorac website it's not available at Ulta
right now and
the entire collection is a
limited-edition I'm not sure when it
will be completely gone but if you were
looking for a go to face palette you
love good blushes you love a gold
highlight I would check out the one from
lorac and Beauty and the Beast this next
one is a face palette that I am still
completely obsessed with I still
absolutely adore this palette of that
one is the Becca cosmetics in Jaclyn
hill I think this was called like the
champagne glow face palette I think was
the proper name for it so inside this is
what you got you got three different
Becca blushes and then you got two
highlighters right here including a
champagne pop which was kind of like the
original collaboration between Jaclyn
hill and Becca cosmetics and then also
in here was Prosecco pop this was
another highlighter made with Jaclyn
hill and becca cosmetics and then these
are three of Becca blushes the shades
are amaretto rose a spritz and a
Pamplemousse are the name of the three
blushes that are in here now this was
some like legit packaging this is a
heavy pallet like it's absolutely
beautiful this is the most boss mirror
of life in this palette when I got it I
don't know if you'd be able to tell it I
probably put this in my used and abused
makeup tag I'm assuming but even though
I haven't hit pan on anything which is
pretty shocking like this palette is
just dusty and dirty and you can tell
that has been loved because I use this
one so much the only shade I didn't
really get a lot of use out of was this
Pamplemousse right here it's just too
bright of a pink for my skin tone so
that one didn't really work for me I
loved having a big champagne pop in here
Prosecco pop is an absolutely gorgeous
gold highlight and then both of these
blushes I was obsessed with in
particularly amaretto which was funny
because when I first got the palette I
thought you are probably not gonna use
that shade a lot and then this was the
palette that made me realize that I love
a neutral blush on me didn't really know
that until then and I didn't know that I
loved to go with highlight on me I never
thought I could pull off a gold
highlight which is funny because I have
a gold highlight on today this was the
palette that made me learn those two
things about myself but one of my
favorite palettes I continually reach
for this I continually travel with this
I adored this palette so bad you can no
longer get this palette which is super
sad it has been sold out for quite some
time but you still can get champagne pop
as an individual on the Becca cosmetics
and also the Sephora website I used to
have
Sekou pub and a different blush in split
pans but I don't see them available
anymore either which is super sad to me
because I always thought those would be
a good idea too but if you haven't tried
out the becca blushes or the Becca
highlighters those are still available
individually I'm not sure of all the
different shades that are available but
both of those items i would recommend
from the brand even though you can't get
it in this big palette anymore but yes
this was definitely one of my favorite
and still is one of my favorite face
pallets haven't Sumar left to talk about
to the next one is from a pure cosmetics
and this was their trolls palette man
was I obsessed with this palette when it
came out it does have a mirror here and
then here all of the different shades
here did send this to me and man was I
so appreciative of that because I ended
up falling in love this palette I kept
recommending it everywhere and then
since it was limited edition it went out
of stock for a very long time and then
finally I saw the announcement I think
it was on Instagram that Pierre was like
for the overwhelming demand we're
bringing it back the trolls palette and
I was like good call Pierre good call
right now the only place that I do see
it available for sale is the pur website
so I will of course have that linked
down below I'm not sure how long they're
bringing it back for us so I would
suggest getting your hands on it before
it goes on a stock again cuz of this was
a gorgeous palette it is incredibly
pigmented you need to just lightly dip
your brush into these shades and you are
going to get some amazing pay off the
shimmers are so beautiful I love some of
the colors in here this deep orange is
absolutely gorgeous these two really
down here these two darker shades are so
pretty I love this kind of like deep
navy blue over here it was gorgeous
there's just so many beautiful shades in
here I came up with so many different
looks with it I know the palette that
like I said I recommended it all the
time and now that it's back in stock for
a little bit I highly suggest you go
pick up the trolls palette from pur
cosmetics alright and the last limited
edition that pellet that I absolutely
love is from morphe and it is the one in
collaboration with Jaclyn hill this is
their most recent collaboration the
Jaclyn hill palette I am pretty much
obsessed with this palette I don't know
if you can tell like how dirty that is
I'm not someone who like really makes a
mess with their makeup or like really
uses and abuses their makeup like I'm
just
much more careful I don't know what it
is but I am but for this palette to be
this dirty and like this just shows how
often I reach for this one I just feel
like there are so many different color
combinations that I can do with this
there's so many different looks in here
and there is 35 shades so like obviously
like you would kind of hope so but even
if I just want something super basic I
can do that if I want something fall I
can do that if I want something colorful
I can do that if I want something
beautiful shimmery I can do that
definitely was the best morphe palette
that i have ever used and i have a lot
of morphe palette i've been buying from
them for a very long time this formula
is definitely highly the best one that I
have tried from morphe they are
extremely blendable they're extremely
pigmented there's really not a lot of
shades in here that I don't think work
well except for these two down here
these were really not my favorites
but other than that you're talking about
33 really good eyeshadows in an
eyeshadow palette which i think is
pretty phenomenal you see me reaching
for this one quite a bit I like to share
what makeup I'm wearing over on my
snapchat and you see this one being
pulled out quite a bit because I just
think it's really really good and I
think that I can have a lot of
versatility with this one so I'm
reaching for it a lot
I do wish it had a mirror in here that's
kind of like my only complaint I love
palettes with mirrors and I think I've
mentioned every other palette that I've
talked about I'm pretty sure has had a
mirror it's just really helpful when
you're doing your makeup so that is the
part that sucks to me but other than
that I love this palette and I do highly
recommend it now it is out of stock on
the morphe website but I hear another
launch is supposed to be coming I'm not
sure how many more launches they're
gonna be doing for it I think they've
done too so far after the initial launch
and I'm not sure how many more will be
coming so I would really suggest picking
it up on the next lunch just since we
don't know how many that they're gonna
do I really have no idea when they will
finally stop production on the palette
this one is a really really good one and
I highly do recommend the morphe and
Jaclyn hill palette okay so those are 7
of my favorite limited edition items
that I own some is still in stock and I
highly suggest you run out and get them
before they go away completely and some
sadly are gone probably forever but hey
maybe wasn't make a comeback we never
know but I would love to
you guys would want to see maybe like a
tutorial or like a get ready with me
using some of these limited-edition
products of course I have other limited
edition items in my collection as well I
could maybe do some sort of like full
face with that because I really do
understand that people do get frustrated
with limited edition they buy it and
then nobody talks about it anymore and
nobody puts it in tutorials because
we're afraid we're gonna make people mad
because not everybody got it but then
the people who did get it are like we'll
wait like I went out and bought this
palette because everyone told me to and
now it's just sitting here and I have
nothing you know I've no to toriel's
I've no in spell etc so I totally get
both sides of the coin here so thank you
guys so much for requesting this video
and requesting it so often I really do
appreciate that because I probably
wouldn't have thought of this video idea
on my own so thank you and let me know
if there's anything that you want to see
tutorial wise or looks-wise with some of
these limited edition items and I can
totally get that on my list as well but
thank you guys so much for watching I
really hope that you found this video
helpful or entertaining in some way if
you did I hope that you will give it a
thumbs up I hope that you will also
consider subscribing before you go and
I'll catch you guys real soon in my next
one bye
