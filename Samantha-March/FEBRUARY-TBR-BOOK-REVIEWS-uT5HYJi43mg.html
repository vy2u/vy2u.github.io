video is going to be my favorite book
reviews so these are going to be all the
books that I read and reviewed in the
month of februari on my blog chicklet
plus so if you'd like to see what i have
been reading then please plug in the
landscape and this is by larisa
reinhardt this is a mystery book and it
is a part of the cherry Tucker series i
think i have read every single book in
the Cherry Tucker series and I have
loved all of them I'm a big fan of
mystery especially Matt the like real a
suspense horror thriller type mystery
like a little bit more on the
light-hearted side of mystery that won't
keep me up at night and I feel like this
is what the cherry Tucker series falls
into it is still a mystery you know
there is still dead bodies and victims
and suspects and suspense and all that
but like it's not gory or anything like
that so again i really enjoy the cherry
Tucker series I gave this one a
four-star review this one was fun
because the setting was different the
Terry gets commissioned to draw like a
winner portrait in a Hogzilla hunt so
the setting is very different if you can
imagine because they this event is to
find this haga that is running around
and I don't know it's very very fun a
very good cast of characters I thought
very interesting a lot of new like
twists and turns along the way but fewer
fan of mysteries I say definitely took
out Larissa's books and the cherry
Tucker series I me if you can see I have
no idea if you guys can see what I had
my laptop in my lap again because of
course why would my surface work right
now why would it can anyone tell me why
my service of work I can't tell you why
would work that thing never works ever
but the next 1i have is the Rambler
assistance by aidan Donnelly rally I
think I got that all right and the
Ramblers was very interesting to me this
is what I would define as literary
fiction so it's like it's a little bit
more on the deeper side like there's no
Chiclets to it there's not of like not a
lot of like comedy and romance you know
that sort of thing it's just a little
bit deeper it's a little bit more
intense the writing to me is
little bit slower when it comes to
literary fiction so sometimes I kind of
struggle in the beginning like I did
with this one like I I struggled to find
my pace with the novel because I just
think literary fiction to me just reads
a little bit slower but I ended up
really enjoying it I gave it four stars
basically follows three characters the
book is set in New York and we were
following Cleo Smith &amp;amp; Tate and I
thought I was interesting because Cleo
and Smith are both both female
characters that were following but Tate
is a male character so it was really
interesting to me especially with Tate's
character to get his point of view and
like get into his mind and I really
enjoyed that about him but the three
kind of all they do interconnect in ways
and I was interesting to follow the
three characters and C are they
interconnect and see why they are the
Ramblers like the title because each of
them was kind of like searching for
something and it kinda it all fit
together really well so after I got over
my initial hump of like thinking that it
was just a little bit on the slower side
actually ended up really enjoying it so
I give that one four stars another one I
read is frost a cowboy and this is by
charlene Ross I will say I didn't
necessarily love the cover but the
synopsis is what drew me in for it so
that is why I decided to read it will
say that this one I thought was very
steamy so I think this one is definitely
for an older audience because definitely
some steamy scenes but also the main
character is I don't know I just found
her to be so relatable but also so
likable she was kind of like no holds
bar like doesn't take any crap from
anyone like I don't know she just she
was like a breath of fresh air reading
about I really really enjoyed following
her character um the book I thought was
very well written i thought it was fast
paced i thought it was funny that I was
surprising like she was one of those
characters where you think you know what
she's going to do because it kind of
would follow the usual flow of a novel
but then like she wanted to do something
totally different and I was like okay
girl I get what you're doing but I ended
up really
drawing it gave it four stars that one
has a frosted cowboy another one I read
and reviewed and I gave 5 stars2 it is
called up and in by Deborah Disney so
this one I actually just mentioned in my
februari book favorites video so I will
leave that link in the description box
below for you guys to check out that has
all the five-star books at me and my
review team had that chocolate plus for
the month of februari and up and in is
mentioned in that one another one that I
read and gave 5 stars2 is the widow by
Fiona Barton this is a psychological
thriller and I feel like I had a lot of
really good things to say about it so
definitely check out the februari
favorites video which will be linked
down below so I'm read The Witches of
Cambridge and this is by men of Van
Praagh not really sure that I'm saying
that right and this one I actually I had
this one in my most recent book haul and
I was saying how I was so excited for
because i really love like magical
realism how big laughing I'm charmed I
was also happy that so many other people
responded saying you're a fan of charmed
yes but I just didn't I just didn't like
this one I gave it a three star review
because it was able to hold my attention
enough that I was able to you know I
still read the whole book it didn't suck
me in I didn't find myself picking up my
kindle a doll I wasn't like excited to
get back into the storyline it just read
very slowly for me and just did not hold
my interest unfortunately there were a
lot of different characters and a lot of
different plot points and just like a
lot to kind of keep track of and I don't
know if maybe that like threw me off
like there was just too many people and
too many different situations happening
that I was like what are we doing what
are we doing what are we doing but
unfortunately this one was amiss for me
so the next one I have I actually did
give five stars to but because I
recorded my februari book favorites so
early I actually didn't get it included
in there so I'm gonna try to remember to
put it in marches favorites because I
did love it i reviewed it what day it
went out februari 24th and that tells
you how early I filmed it's because we
were doing some traveling and stuff so I
was pre filming but this book is called
flying by the seat of my knickers and
that's PI Eliza Watson and I did mention
in my review that you know I'm totally
upfront with stuff like this but I was a
beta reader for Eliza Watson
so I actually read this book like way
early on it was I believe us on time
last year but in the early scenes of the
book gave my feedback you know just let
her know what I liked what I didn't like
what I thought could be different should
be different how I connect with the
characters you know all that sort of
good stuff I was very excited i love
beta reading I don't get to do it super
often because my schedule is just so
crazy but I'm really happy for the times
that I do get to do it and so when Eliza
you know she got a rewrite and did her
editing and got everything ready to go
got ready to publish and then she
contacted me and sent me a final margin
oven I'm so excited to read it and it
was bomb it was so good definitely a
book that I love reading because travel
is heavily featured the book is actually
set in Dublin and I had such a blast
reading about it and there's like oh
there's there's castles and I just even
like the talk about like foods like two
different foods that they eat like I
just I just love that kind of stuff so
that aspect was totally awesome for me
there is two sisters were basically
getting the the point of view from the
one sister who she's kind of like the
black sheep she's never been able to
stack up against her older sister and
now she's not in a relationship anymore
she's out of a job she goes to Dublin
actually to help with her sister who was
an event planner her sister kinda like
throws her bone is like okay how about
you come help me to like kind of get you
back on her feet but what she's not
telling her sister is that she was in an
abusive relationship that she was
getting out of like she's got a lot of a
lot of baggage and a past and it was it
was a good book because it was funny
there was comedic moments in it you know
of course I was like romance and things
like that but it also took it to another
level and made it a great book because
there were so many different layers that
we could peel back and I just found it
fascinating there's a great like
heritage story in here as well I loved
it I didn't want to put it down I'm so
happy about this bug I'm so I'm so
excited that it turned out so fantastic
for Eliza so definitely want to check
out flying by the seat of my knickers it
is number one in a series as I was
writing my review I said I really hope
this is a part of a serious because I
love the characters so much i hope we
could follow him and it
this is book one more to come I also
read and review change of plans this is
by mila rossi i recently reviewed for
Mila it was called wild games I did
mention in that review bit of a steamy
romance novel for an older genre / an
older age group genre you know whatever
same with change of plans because this
one it says right hand snaps is that the
main characters emergent and she's
looking to have a one-night stand so she
can just like get her virginity taken
and move on with life and not have that
hanging over her 25-year old head
anymore so there's that and that
definitely is what happens and it
happens right away and like we get into
the action and when I say action I mean
action I don't know why I'm so like with
my hands I don't even have nails on I've
known nail polish on but I'm very like
Hensley today it's probably cuz I just
watch talladega nights anyone else I
don't know what I'm supposed to do with
my hands anybody back to the book so
yeah it starts off right away into the
seamier action when she finds a guy to
have the one-night stand with and what I
mentioned in my review that I really
liked is that you know how in a lot of
these books where it's like the virgin
and she needs like the rich boy type
thing and the and the guy is always like
super dominating yada yada and she's
like a weak little thing it was almost
kind of like flipped and that's what I
really liked about it like she was the
one kind of like calling the shots and
being in charge and he was the one that
was like but I really like you like why
can't we just be together and that's
what I found really refreshing about
this one so that is change of plans and
I gave it everything for my book reviews
