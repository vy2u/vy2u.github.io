so today's video is going to be my
februari of beauty favorites so I will
just be going through some of my beauty
and makeup products that I loved on so
much in the month of februari so if you
would like to see my favorites from the
past month please can I have a few
eyeshadows to talk about and these are
all I shadows from colour-pop I got them
in my most recent order and I got a few
other ones but these are like my most
favorite the ones that I keep
gravitating towards the first one that i
have is puppy love and if you can see on
here it has like a really cute little
paw print on there and it's because all
the proceeds for this do go towards the
no-kill shelter in LA but this is what
the actual product looks like it I don't
know if you'll be able to see it on my
hand really well but here is a swatch
it's just a really beautiful pearlized
shimmery color it is coined as an
eyeshadow but I also wear it as a
highlighter and I think it looks amazing
in my most recent tutorial I used it as
a highlighter and I absolutely loved it
the other 1i have is mixed tape and this
is actually like the eyeshadow that i
did use in my most recent tutorial that
featured a lot of color pop but is this
really cool like purple lavender shade
and when I got this ordering from
colour-pop this was the shade that I
immediately was like I feel like I'm
going to use you a lot and I've actually
hid paint on it job is pretty impressed
with so there is the swatch of that the
next one I have is so quiche and this
was another one that when I got it I was
like how am I going to use you and I
used this in my super bowl look I posted
on Instagram a few photos of this I
actually put down a plaid from
colour-pop first and it's a really
pretty like four screen and then I put
this so quiche on top of it because it
doesn't it looks fine by itself there's
the swatch of that but it looks really
good on top of another shadow especially
a green because this has like a light
green base to it and then a lot of like
gold shimmer and gold flecks and it just
is stunning I love it so far I've only
used an over plat but I bet it would
look good over other colors as well but
it is gorgeous so I probably should have
used flat in here because you know so
Keisha typically use it with plaid plaid
is a good one too it's just a like
simple for screen from colour-pop and I
really liked it but Sookie she's like I
do have to nail polishes to talk about
and of course they are from the sally
hansen miracle gel line i'm obsessed
with these nail polishes I swear every
time I go to Target or CVS or somewhere
that sells them I always just kind of
like casually walk by if anything sticks
out to me like any shade I see and I'm
like cut my eyes towards it I typically
buy it it's not good but it's such a
good line like it it really is and these
two colors I've just been like going
crazy for one is in all chalked up it's
like a light lavender but almost a
little bit on the gray side to like I
think when I posted a picture someone
commented on it being gray but it's got
more like purple in it as well but it's
beautiful the other one that has been
like my absolute favorite is head bang
and it is a really pretty like almost
like a chocolate brown but it has maybe
some like a little bit of red tones to
it as well and someone said it is the
nail polish version of limbo a from
colour-pop a liquid lipstick from
colour-pop that made me laugh pretty
hard I don't think it's like that quite
of a brown especially because I do seem
like a little bit of red in it but I
have worn this so many times a hair care
product that I have that I was a pretty
surprised that I ended up loving so much
but not mad about it it's from the oh gx
line and it is there anti-gravity and
hydration weightless oil and lifting
tonic getting quite fancy but the names
here but this is what this one looks
like this was like a spur-of-the-moment
purchase at CVS I got it because it says
moisturizes volume eyes and breathes
life into fine hair so basically
supposed to give fine here a little bit
more volume but still hydrating your
hair and not like drawing it out and
doing all those
things to it and so I went for it I got
it and then I kind of felt stupid for it
because I just struggle with hair
products I don't feel like a lot of them
work and this was like nine dollars or
something for this little bottle and I
kind of regretted it but it works and
I'm the first one to say like I'm kind
of shocked so basically if you can see
there's kind of like oil up here and
then more the product is down here but
you shake it together to mix the two
together and then immediately spray it
all over your hair I typically have used
it on like damp air once I'm out of the
shower and kind of like towel dried my
hair and all that and combed it but I
remember using it for the first day not
really thinking anything of it and then
I was down in my office and I was doing
snapchats and taking photos and I was
like why is my hair looks so different
like it just it looked like it had more
volume usually it's just kind of like
what it is today it's like kind of like
limp and fine and I'm like that's that's
weird and then I realized it was because
I'd use this so the next time I showered
I used this again and the same results
happen and I was like okay that really
does work so i use this almost every
single time that I get out of the shower
I'm loving it I'm very happy with my
purchase and yeah I herrick your product
that actually works for me have a few
lip products to talk about to finish
this off and the first one I have to
talk about is Lumiere to this is from
colour-pop they're actually they're all
from colour-pop so shocking i know but
this is Lumiere to from colour-pop I was
so excited to get it this is what the
shades looks like and this is a
collaboration that youtuber
kathleenlights did with colour-pop do
have a whole video breaking down my
latest colour-pop order and it talks a
lot about Lumiere to and the
collaboration and all that good stuff
and it's watches and everything like
that so I will leave that video link in
the description box below so you can go
check it out but Lumiere 2 i've been
wearing it so much it's a beautiful like
rich deep mauve color a little bit on
like the darker pink side it's just it's
stunning the colour-pop formula is
continuing to get better love this one
the other three I have to talk about is
my favorite
like lip go to color combinations that
I've been doing for about the past month
and it is actually the lips that I did
in my most recent makeup tutorial but
basically what I do as I first come in
with the Lumiere lip liner from
colour-pop so this is also from
kathleenlights when she first said her
collapse she came out with Lumiere as a
libby stick and a lip pencil so I have
the lip pencil so what I do is align my
whole lips and then I also fill them in
I have found that filling my lips in
with a creamy lip liner before going in
with a liquid lipstick is like saving my
lips saving them but then what I'll do
is I will go in with clueless from
colour-pop another one of the ultra
matte liquid lipsticks and i will put
clueless over my little just over my
lips fill in all my lips with clueless
it's a beautiful everyday pink color
it's so gorgeous and then on top of all
of that I will come in with midi from
colour-pop i will put midi just in the
center of my lips to kind of make my
lips look a little bit fuller and so
just in the center of the bottom and the
top lift at GLIP i hope midi and it's
like a frosty i see pink shade a little
bit of a lighter pink so it just kind of
brings more definition to the lips and
makes them look a little bit bigger so
midi on top of it my husband is working
in the basement if you can't tell but
yeah these are like this is like my
go-to look right now usually when I'm
not doing that I'm doing like lube in
here lumiere today I don't have 1i
liquid lipstick because I've been
wearing them so much I just need my lips
to like breathe a little bit every once
in a while I have to give them a break
but yeah these are favorite lip colors
right now and I love color pop the ultra
mats are only six dollars which is
pretty hot everything's for this video I
