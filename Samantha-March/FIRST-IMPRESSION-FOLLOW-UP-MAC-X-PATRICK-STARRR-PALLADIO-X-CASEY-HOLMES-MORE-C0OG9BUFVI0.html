today's video is going to be a first
impression a follow-up video and it's
going to be following up on two separate
videos that I did one was a collab video
with my friend Kim where we were testing
out each other's drugstore favorites and
that video was a first impression and
then also I did a first impression
Friday where I was testing out some new
makeup releases so as always with my
first impressions I am back to give a
follow-up on everything my reviews what
worked for me what did not work for me
so if you are ready for some makeup
reviews why don't I go ahead and get
started so I did my video with Kim first
I am fairly sure I will have a book
these videos so I'm talking about link
down below again these products were
ones that I picked up myself because we
were trying each other's drugs to our
favorites so I'm going to tell you if
any of her favorites have become my
favorites so first up I did try a
foundation this is the Rimmel lasting
finish a 25-hour breathable foundation
so I didn't have to kind of cheat on
this one a little bit because she said
that her a favorite Rimmel foundation
was the one with the red cap but that
one is being discontinued so I went to
my CVS to find some Rimmel products and
they did not have that one anymore so I
picked up the new one here so this is
kind of what's replacing the red cap it
says it's a long wear foundation it's
high definition finished medium coverage
I picked up my shade in 200 soft beige
you can find this at CVS I believe it
was around seven eight dollars and again
at Target I was seeing it for seven
dollars so this is one that I liked
right off the bat right as I was
applying it as I was blending it out as
I finished with the video I really liked
this a foundation it does have kind of
this interesting applicator here and I
didn't mind that for applying it to my
face that reminded me of the Clinique
beyond perfecting it's not my favorite
way to apply foundation but I don't mind
it and it felt it felt nice and
hydrating on the skin I do have dry skin
and I don't like when a foundation is to
matte
I got a little worried when it said it
was a long wear foundation sometimes a
long wear can equal like full coverage
and that's not necessarily my favorite
but right underneath that it says medium
coverage
I would agree I think the coverage is a
solid medium of
you can kind of play with it and build
it up to get it a little bit
unlike the medium to full side but I
think this is a nice medium coverage
foundation which is my sweet spot like I
said it feels almost just a little bit
hydrating it's pretty liquidy on the
skin which means you don't need a lot of
foundation to put it on because when you
start to blend it out like a little bit
goes a long way
I like the coverage I like the way it
made my skin look it looks like it's not
necessarily like an overly dewy
foundation like I don't look like really
glowy or anything like that once I apply
this it's not mad at all on me but it's
just like the it's your skin but it's
better it's smoother you know any
discolorations are kind of camouflage
with this one and I really really like
this foundation I've been very impressed
with it even after my review period was
up I kept reaching for this one because
I really liked it and actually today
this is what I wanted to wear but I did
just a self-tan so I know I'm gonna be
getting a little bit darker here so I
went with all of my darker foundations
because this one is a little bit on the
lighter side for me but when I'm not
soft and I've been finding myself
reaching for this one quite a bit I will
say that a lot of people are saying that
they don't like this one in comparison
to the red cap but like I said I've
never tried the red cap one so I cannot
compare it to that foundation but I feel
like I'm seeing a lot of that so I don't
know maybe if it's one of those things
where if you've never tried the red cap
and you tried this one you might like it
because you're not comparing it so the
older product but I like this one a lot
for me it kind of ticks all those boxes
that I like for my foundation so this
one was a win for me I also tried out
the NYX HD studio photogenic concealer
this is about five dollars at Ulta which
is a great price for a concealer I was
really excited that this was on Kim's
list because this was actually a
concealer that I had almost bought so
many times because a lot of people
really liked this concealer I've seen it
mentioned in a lot of dupe videos before
so I was excited to give this one a try
I picked mine up in the shade zero 4
which is beige again really impressed
with this concealer it's a very full
coverage underneath the eyes and I like
a full coverage concealer not a
foundation I've heard my concealer I
want full coverage it blends out very
easily a little bit of creasing
if I set it and especially if I set it
with a loose powder like I've really
been loving the RC main no color powder
I don't you know deal with any creasing
like that I think that it holds up for a
really long time so this is one that I'm
very impressed with and again when I put
it on in that first impression this
video I was like I think I'm gonna like
this concealer and I definitely do so
it's a good a full coverage long-lasting
and concealer and for five bucks I will
totally repurchase this one Thank You
Kim alrighty so next up I have a mascara
here this is from essence this is the
false eyelashes mascara for dramatic
volume unlimited so I will say I'm not a
big mascara where I wear a lot of false
lashes it is my preference so sometimes
when I'm trying out a new mascara like I
kind of already go into them like I'm
probably I love this mascara I could
love this mascara I will say though I
think this one is really nice and I
believe this one is around $5 which is a
fantastic price so this is what the wand
it looks like let me show you and this
was kind of one when I took it out I was
like I feel like it's kind of like a
standard wand and like I didn't see like
like I just kind of looked at it like
mmm I don't know what this is really
gonna do much but again this is really
nice it gives me length and it gives me
volume and I really want both in my
mascara because I really have like four
lashes like I mean they're just
nothing's really working with them so I
need length and I need volume and I
think that this gives it to me it also
makes my lashes nice and like really
black which i think is great the only
thing that I don't love about this
mascara is that it starts to flake after
a very prolonged period of time like if
I put this on in the morning at like 8 9
o'clock and if I still have it on like
10 o'clock at night it's starting to
flake it's not as bad as like the Too
Faced better than sex mascara or the
L'Oreal lash paradise mascara those
flake on me within like two hours of
putting it on but I notice if I'm
wearing this for a very long time
it'll start to kind of flake on to my
face but you know if I'm only going out
for a couple of hours I don't think it's
necessary to put on false lashes and I
just want some mascara that will make my
lashes look nice that's when I've been
reaching for this mascara so for five
dollars I still think this one was out
pretty darn good for me especially for
someone who doesn't gravitate towards
muscarella
next so
is me and I feel like I feel like I
really liked a lot of these products
because I was gonna say maybe this one
is my favorite maybe after the
foundation maybe after the concealer I
felt like I got a lot of good ones in
here but this one I'm very impressed
with this is from revolution Beauty it's
the vivid baked highlighter in peach
lights it's what I have on my face today
and I am incredibly impressed with this
highlighter it's one of their baked
highlighters and it runs for about six
dollars so you can see it's a really
stunning highlight it looks more pink in
the pants me than peach and I don't know
if I can really mmm I don't know it's
like a peachy pink on the cheeks but it
is like it's almost like an iridescent
glow when you put it on you do not need
a lot of product to get a beautiful glow
you are use a fluffy brush typically
when I'm putting this highlight on
sometimes if highlights need a little
bit more help a little bit more umph
I'll go with a really dense brush to
apply it but if I highlight really packs
a punch I do a fluffy brush just to try
not to be like too intense with my
highlight and I like intense highlight
so that's saying a lot
I use a fluffy one a fluffy brush with
this one because it is no joke and it's
about six dollars and I'm very impressed
and again I I feel like I should do more
of these videos with people more of
these collab style videos because this
isn't a highlight then I don't think I
would have bought this on my own just
because it says baked highlighter and I
don't I don't know if I own even one big
tie lighter not because I don't think
that I would like them it's just
something that I've never gravitated
towards like I haven't tried a lot of so
I just kind of skip over them when I see
them so I don't know if I ever would
have picked this one up on my own so
thank you Kim I'm seriously impressed
with this highlight again for only $6
revolution Beauty peach lights I would
totally buy more of these as well super
impressed next up I didn't talk about
the eyeshadow palette that I used this
is from ELF it's the mad for matte
eyeshadow palette this one is in summer
breeze okay so this was another one
where I really did want to try out this
palette I was hearing good things about
it I remember seeing it get released and
I was like ooh that palette looks really
beautiful and I kind of was a little
hesitant in that video to use it I was a
little bit nervous because I had just
tried a similar palette like this from
ELF and it caused me a lot of eye
rotation like a lot of really bad I
irritated so I was kind of worried going
into this palette I will say that I
didn't have a reaction as strongly as I
did was it was called like the nude
blush or blush nude palette from ELF but
I did have I it's almost like it made my
eyelids really crusty the next day I
noticed that I was kind of like peeling
like Krusty's off my eyes the entire day
after I used it and I did try this one
another time as well and I have the same
thing so luckily it wasn't as bad as the
first time where my eyes were like
extremely red puffy like the following
day and there was no chance I was
putting on any eye makeup and even the
next day I think all I put on was
mascara to film a video because my eyes
were still so irritated so something
about the elf eyeshadow formula is
irritating to my eyes which is such a
bummer because this is a beautiful
palette I loved the eye look that I
created in that video I really enjoyed
the other eye look that I did when I was
doing it off camera again more testing
to see if I was gonna have a reaction to
it but this is a really nice shadow
palette it's $10 you get a nice mirror
in here I'm very impressed with the
colors they're all mad I think that
they're really beautiful I just I don't
know how often I'll I'll reach for this
palette again because something about
the formulation of these shadows is
irritating my eyes so I'm super bummed
about that because I really really liked
this palette I like the colors I thought
they performed so well but I don't know
I know a quite a few people actually in
that video also said you have reactions
to health eyeshadows as well so I'm
super bummed about that but this is a
really nice palette I would recommend it
if you you know aren't gonna have any
crazy things happened with your eyes but
dang it and like the second time that I
used it I was like okay crusty eyelids
isn't that terrible but I was like it's
still doing something bad to my eyes you
know like you shouldn't just keep using
it like you have other palettes
girlfriend get it together
the last item that I'm going to talk
about though is the lipstick that I wore
this is again from Rimmel it's in
collaboration with Kate Moss this is in
shade 33 so it's kind of like a nice
bubblegum pink I did do a swatch here on
my
and so that's what it looks like and I
also of course did wear it in that video
I I don't really love the lipstick the
shade I actually didn't mind I think I
would wear this more in like spring
summer because it's kind of you know
more of this like kind of bubblegum pink
I didn't mind the shade but it was a
very sheer lipstick and I prefer
something that's a little bit more like
opaque on the lips so it kind of looked
when I applied it I could still almost
kind of see my lips through it so
unfortunately this one I ended up not
loving I don't think I would repurchase
more of these as shades on my own but
really I think this is about the only
thing other than elf like irritating my
eyes this is really the only thing from
that video that I was like not super
super hyped about but I think these are
like five or six dollars so again
they're really affordable and I know
they do have quite a large shade
selection they didn't at my CVS but I've
seen online they have quite a few colors
in there again I didn't mind this color
but it was just a little bit too sheer
for me if you don't mind that with your
lipsticks you know you go ahead and rock
it but for me personally it different
got the bus for me but those are all of
the items that I tried out in my collab
video with Kim I want we go ahead and
move over to my first impression Friday
video so in that first impressions video
I was testing out a lot of new and
makeup releases and one collection that
I have here is the new floral floral
realness collection with a Mac and a
Patrick Starr I was really excited to
get this in PR I was super stoked they
sent me the me so fleek collection so it
includes a four pan eyes shadow palette
which looks like so and obviously I
didn't I look with this featuring mostly
the blue and they're the balloon the
pink and then you also have a blush duo
in here which I thought was really
beautiful it also does come with a
mirror so you have two different blushes
in there and then it does have two
different lip products you have a
lipstick and then a lip gloss so this is
what the lipstick looks like and I can
go ahead and do a swatch of this one as
well so there is the lipstick now the
lip gloss is the only thing that I
haven't tried in this collection because
it is like a sparkly pink gloss if you
can see through there and it's just not
something that I would wear us instead
of even swatching it I would just rather
be able to give it away to somebody so
they could enjoy it so I can't say for
sure on the gloss I actually do
like my glasses they're not my absolute
favorite but I'm also not a glass person
but a pink sparkly glass is typically
not what I go for now there is two
different collections that Patrick Starr
did with Mack and you do have to
purchase them as collections with the
last time Patrick start collab with Mack
you could buy the items separately but
this time you would have to purchase all
four items in either collection so
that's one of the downsides to it I
think because you know maybe you only
want the eyeshadows or you only want one
lipstick but you would have to purchase
it also it would just have to see you
know I would only recommend getting it
if you do want at least three of the
four items that are gonna come inside or
you could go in with a friend you know
maybe you want the eyeshadow palette the
friend wants a lipstick I don't know you
could work it out that way
but that is something to make note of
what the collections um of course
everything that I'm talking about will
be linked down below as usual so the
collections are 4950 which I don't feel
like is a terrible price um the
eyeshadow quads in the last
collaboration
we're thirty two dollars so you think
you have what seventeen dollars all
those hard seventeen dollars but then
you would have the seventeen dollars and
that would be for the blush palette with
two blushes a lipstick and a lip gloss
so I mean again it's gonna be up to you
but I think that's pretty on par for Mac
and especially with that being a
collaboration I could have even seen the
collections being priced higher because
you know usually when there's a
collaboration price less time to go up
so I thought from Mac that was pretty on
point for them I guess so I'm going
through each of the products now the
eyeshadow palette I do really like I
really enjoyed the last collaboration I
really enjoyed those eyes shadows I like
all the colors in here the blue I don't
think I will get as much use out of the
blue as I will the other shades in here
just because I don't go for like an
intense blue shadow a ton I will also
have an Instagram tutorial going up with
this palette using the three shades -
the blue I will have a tutorial going up
shortly with that it was in one of my
makeup look in my last will i buy it
video so if I its up already I will have
it linked down below so you can see it I
really like the colors in here though I
feel like these shadows are very
pigmented I feel like they blend well I
feel like
true to color to what's in the pan and I
have a great time with these I really do
recommend these Mac shadows I recommend
it the last collaboration with Patrick
Starr at the eye shadow palettes I think
are really really good so happy with
that the blush palette I do actually
have on my cheeks today I like to
combine these two blushes in here I
really like the shades in this blush
palette really I'm very impressed with
this it has a little marionette like I
said there's a little mirror knit the
packaging on everything is super cute as
well
okay the floral realness super cute on
all of it but these are very pigmented
you need a very light hand very light
hand with these like I said I like to
mix them together I just kind of tap my
brush in each one instead of like
swirling cuz I like the kind of do Onis
to it but again I think they're very
pigmented and very beautiful you don't
need to work hard with the blushes very
happy with this the lipstick honestly it
was kind of a letdown to me that was
super bummed about it again I was
wearing this one in my latest well I
bite victim the instead Graham tutorial
but this is really really dry and if you
have dry lips or cracked lips or chapped
lips like I do right now
then it just like really accentuates
that you have like dry flaky skin on
your lips and what's interesting to me
is I never really purchased matte
lipsticks because I would hear a lot of
reviews of people saying that they're a
very dry formula but I think out of all
of the MAC lipsticks that I've tried and
I've now tried a lot of them I have
never found that to be the case
until this one I was like shocked when I
was putting it on and I was like wait a
second what's going on it kind of
reminded me a little bit of the anasazi
and matte lipsticks which are not my
favorite but those I mean those are like
really really drive this was just like
getting on to that level it is a retro
matte lipstick so you know the matte
lipsticks are definitely tougher to get
on but honestly the Mac matte lipsticks
are still some of my favorite lipstick
formulas so I was just shocked at how
dry this was so unfortunately I don't
know maybe I got a bad one I hate saying
that but I was just really surprised at
how dried this was so unfortunately the
lipstick don't work out for me I really
enjoyed the color but I did not like how
it looked on my lips the collection out
of what I tried the eyeshadow palette in
the blush trio which honestly did
probably like the most expensive out of
the collection these two were really
good I just wish that lipstick wasn't a
Miss hmm so next up right
a new concealer from milk makeup this is
called the Flex concealer and the video
I used these two different shades I will
say that light is more of my shade in
case you're looking for a shade match
I tried fair first and that one was too
light light is a good match for me but I
will say that I don't I don't love this
one this is what the applicator looks
like pretty standard as well um I mean I
like the packaging on these I don't mind
that at all when I first put it on it
felt like it was going to be a really
hydrating but still a solid coverage
concealer but once I started to blend it
out it's like it dries up and like it
dries very quickly it was kind of
bizarre so I knew that this was gonna be
a concealer that I wanted to do when I
first put the product on blended I'll
even set it then move on to the other
eye but it's like no matter how quickly
I work with this it still gets really
dry on my under eyes it just kind of
accentuates any dryness that I have
under there I don't like setting this
was it with a loose powder because then
it's just a huge you dry mess underneath
there I prefer to stick with like a
pressed powder so it doesn't look quite
as bad but if you're dry or you have
dryness on your under eyes I don't think
that you're gonna like this one it was
about a medium coverage for me I would
say I kind of sheer down a little bit as
you start to blend it out as well but
overall I just the formula with this one
just to not really vibe with my skin it
didn't really vibe with my concealer
needs
it's $28 so that's pretty pricey for a
concealer and honestly I like the five
dollar one from NYX more next up I have
some new items up from morphe here so
first up I tried out these blush trios
so morphe just released their blush
trios they are $12 each and they have a
lot of different options the one that I
used in the video was this one which is
a pop of fuchsia now these are really
nice packaging you get three big shades
in there you get a nice mirror and those
are what the three shades will look like
in each palette you do get a mixture of
like matte and shimmer is not like you
you do I don't know why I said that you
get a mixture of matte and shimmers and
I had said I put these in a will I bet
video I said I was gonna pass over rum
because I've tried morphe face pallets
before I've tried blush palettes before
contour ballots before and I didn't
really love them I wasn't very impressed
with them didn't have a lot of
pigmentation to them so I kind of went
in just
a little bit heavier handed than I
normally would and I looked like a clown
for a hot second in that video you saw
me trying to blend it out as blending it
out on camera no these are good I mean
Murphy has rebranded they've you know
changed up their packaging on a lot of
different things I'm sure they've
changed up their formula on a lot of
different things and I am actually very
impressed with these blush trios this
one is pop of blush I also board this
one the other day and I thought the
blush in here was beautiful it's kind of
like a cool tone baby pink again you
have this one as the shimmer over here
this one I also really really like I'll
be reaching for this one a lot one of my
favorites at the moment I'm really into
peach right now for whatever reason this
is the pop of peach again I wore this
one in a recent video as well recent
video maybe was just a day out i don't
remember but i reached for this one oh I
think it was a day out of work my
friend's baby shower but also very
long-lasting because I got ready for
that baby shower at nine o'clock and I
didn't come home until after 10:00 and
everything on my face still looked
really good including my blush which
came from this palette I used this
middle shade right here which is a
beautiful peachy blush I thought it was
so gorgeous so these are these are
actually really good they're very
pigmented though you need a light hand
with them but they apply well they stay
on well I like kind of like the
diversity in each of the palettes that
you get and for only $12 legit packaging
three very large blush shades and a
great mirror I don't think you go wrong
with these and then I also did try out
the new morphe highlighters in that
video as well so they also released
these new highlighters I believe these
are finally on sale as well so again
everything will be linked down below I
can't remember now for sure which one I
used in that video I want to say it was
extra maybe extra which looks like this
so again very similar packaging to the
blush trios you get a ton of highlight
here you get a nice mirror
these guys are $14 each and I will say
that I like them you know I used this
one in the video and I liked it I mean
you can see it right away you don't need
to build it up you don't need to you
know if it shows up well and it's really
beautiful it is but I wasn't like overly
wowed with them they're a little bit
powdery nothing like too bad
you know kind of every highlight shows
texture on my skin and this one does
it's just a little bit powdery and just
not quite like that I don't it just
didn't get me super hyped like the like
the revolution Beauty did or even like
the blush trails from more feeds in if
you were trying to decide between should
get a blush trail or a highlight I
honestly would recommend the blush trio
you actually get a lot of shades for
even a cheaper amount then you would one
highlight but you know obviously it's a
personal decision of what you needed
your makeup collection and what you're
gonna wear they just they just weren't
my favorite but they were pretty good
the last up to review I have the liquid
lipsticks from the Cayce homes and
Palladio Beauty collab I was really
excited about these liquid lipsticks I
put them in a Willa byte video I said I
really wanted to get them at kissing
homes this one of my favorite youtubers
someone that I absolutely adore not only
did I want to support the collaboration
it was with an affordable brand and he
started $10 each for a liquid lipstick
and I love liquid lipsticks so it was a
collaboration that made sense for me to
also purchase them because I do wear a
ton of liquid lipsticks so these are
what the liquid lipsticks look like so
she has three different shades I picked
up all of them again they are $10 each
you can find them at Sally Beauty stores
or the plot Eagle Beauty website and I
noticed plenty of beauty has free
shipping over $30 so if you do get all
three then you got free shipping so
that's what I did so here are the
swatches of them so we have Georgia
which is kind of like a peachy pink and
then rescue which I wore in the first
impressions video which is a deep nude
Brown and then we have obsessed which is
a nice berry pink I was wearing this one
in my products I wish I would have tried
sooner video if you want to see it in
action there so these I'm pretty darn
impressed with I'll show you what the
applicator it looks like I'm pretty darn
impressed with these they are very
opaque on the lips and they are
extremely extremely long-lasting these
are the liquid lipsticks where you have
to really go in and kind of like scrub
at your lips at the end of the night
because they last the first day that I
was wearing it which I was wearing
rescue I wore this through my afternoon
snack that I had after I was done
filming and then I also wore it through
dinner and now
remember what I had for dinner that
night and I'm sorry but I remember was
it like a sandwich or a taco or
something where I wasn't just like you
know putting a fork in my mouth like I
was like biting down on something and it
still looked phenomenal after I got done
eating so I was like you know what
Casey Holmes was she wasn't telling us a
lot when she says that these are very
long lasting sometimes it can be a
little rough like sometimes when I'm
deciding when to put on a liquid
lipstick I've honestly passed over these
because I'm like oh I'm gonna take my
makeup off in three hours it's not worth
me having to like scrub at my lips so I
kind of only reach for these when I know
like I'm gonna lipstick on and I want to
stay on for hours otherwise it's just
kind of challenging to take off so I
will say that but I mean it's a it's a
protic on at the same time it just
depends on what you need for that day
but again I really like the way that
they look on the lips they kind of dry
on me like they're not like a super
super drying liquid lipstick which is
good especially because they're so
long-lasting but they can kind of get
dry after a couple hours and just kind
of make my lips look not super great
again because I do have dry lips right
now it just kind of like accentuates
that kind of makes them look a little
bit crustier so kind of what I've been
doing when I have been wearing these for
a really long time and it starts to get
into that I throw a lip gloss on top of
it and I just kind of like a revives and
again I'm so I will say that you know
hopefully that problem would go away
once I get my lips and shape which it's
not snowing today I'm filming a video
and I'm not saying that it's snowing
that's super exciting over here kind of
out of the ordinary I do like all of the
colors in here I will say Georgia is
labeled as like a peach but I think it's
more of like pinky peach it definitely
has some pink to it um so I'll say that
this one again deep nude rescue is
probably my favorite and the one that
I'll wear the most obsessed it's really
beautiful though I feel like I will wear
this a lot in the summer because it's
that very bright kind of berry pink but
really beautiful so I'm happy with my
purchase though especially for ten
dollars I think these are really
phenomenal I'm very happy with them a
huge congrats to casey homes because i
think she did a phenomenal job with this
