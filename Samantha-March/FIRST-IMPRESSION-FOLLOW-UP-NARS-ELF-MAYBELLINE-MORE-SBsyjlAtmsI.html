today's video is going to be a first
impression Friday follow-up video so a
couple of weeks ago I actually did two
back-to-back first impression Friday
videos I will have both of those listed
down below and as always when I do first
impression videos I like to come back
and give a follow-up and give my reviews
and let you know what I thought about
the products that I was testing out for
the first time in those videos so if you
would like to see some reviews from my
first impression videos but let me go
ahead and get started
alrighty so first up the first first
impression Friday video that I did was
featuring a lot of a drugstore
affordable products and one item I am
really bummed about because I really
enjoyed it in the first impression video
and I thought I was gonna be pretty darn
happy with this foundation it was the
maybelline superstay foundation it's one
of their new foundations out there and
when I was trying it I thought oh my
gosh this is really full-coverage looks
really nice on the skin it's just
leaving a nice like flattering finish to
my face and I was very excited about it
in the first impression video I'm not
holding it up and I'm not showing it
because I actually did end up or
returning it unfortunately unfortunately
what I noticed with that foundation
after having it on for a couple of hours
is that it oxidizes and it turns me
pretty dark but also pretty Orange I got
the shade 130 and that shade is it was
like a shade or two lighter than I
normally would wear in the maybelline
foundations because I really enjoy
Maybelline foundations I've been buying
them for a long time I have a lot in my
collection and so my shade was sold out
so I went a couple shades lighter and I
thought no big deal you know it's winter
and typically more pale it'll be fine
but after I have it on and I mean it
takes a while because it took me a while
to notice the first time I was wearing
and even the second time I was wearing
it I was like wait a second why do I
look so different you know three four
hours later it why do I look so Orange
so I realized that it accidentally more
reviews for this foundation a lot of
people are saying the exact same thing
and a lot of people are saying the same
thing as me too is that it is a nice
full coverage foundation and it does
look nice on the skin except it turns
colors on me so unfortunately I ended up
deciding to return it and I wasn't going
to it was 11 dollars which I thought it
was a little bit cheaper but when I did
return it it was eleven dollars and I
wasn't going to because I was like you
know what I like the way it looks like
it's
fine it'll it'll I can make it work like
I can make this work but I can't like I
mean you when you're orange what are you
supposed to do about that so I did end
up returning it to Alto which I was very
bummed about so unfortunately that one
just it did not work out for me I really
wanted to love it I thought I was going
to love it that was one of the first
impression I truly thought I was gonna
love that foundation but it did not work
for me
bummer the next one though I did really
enjoy and this is also from Maybelline
and it's their total temptation a brow
definer some of these reviews in here
are going to be a little bit overlapped
from my Black Friday haul follow-up I
also try to do follow-up videos with
every single haul that I do and some of
these items were mentioned in the Black
Friday haul but then I also did a first
impression with them so I haven't
reviewed this one a my Black Friday haul
follow-up and I also just put it in my
December 2017 makeup monthly in the
favorites section this is a freaking bum
brow pencil I love it
I've been telling everybody how much I
love it I get so many compliments every
time I wear this on my brows I get so
many compliments I absolutely enjoyed
this one if you're a fan of the benefit
goof-proof reminds me of that one it has
a teardrop shape here but it's like
smaller and thinner than the goof proof
I also really enjoyed the spoolie it has
like this cute little spooley on the
other end the spoolie works great I
enjoy the color which isn't blonde it's
not too light it's a really good match
for my brows actually but I love the way
that my brows look with this and it's
very quick and easy to use so I believe
this one is like in the $8 range I think
I paid $7.99 for it at Ulta and I would
HIGHLY highly recommend the brow pencil
the eyeshadow palette that I used in
that first impressions video also had me
pretty darn excited and I'm still
excited over this one this is from a
sleek makeup and it is their eyeshadow
palette in when the sun goes down i
believe this is $13 on the Ulta website
I really enjoy that you get a mirror a
lot of times with like affordable or
drugstore palettes you don't always get
that mirror I did say in that first
impression video when I opened it up I
was like okay like none of the colors
necessarily like really jumped out at me
or you know when I opened it up I kind
of like did the whole judging a book by
it's cover I was like I don't know I
might like it and I really enjoyed the
look that I created in that first
impressions video I've used this palette
I believe
at least two more times I believe it's
been three more times I've used almost
every single shade out of here and I am
really really impressed I have to say
for thirteen dollars this is a nice
eyeshadow palette and I think that you
could create some really pretty looks
with it it's not a formula that
necessarily absolutely blows me away and
you know like I'm shouting from the
rooftops about this one that everybody
needs this palette but it is a good
quality
actually I don't palette I really
enjoyed the tones in here if these are
kind of like your shades I think that
you would really like this palette but
coupl all of that with the mirror I mean
this is a definitely worth the $13 and
even you know you can get it also say
you have like your 350 coupon to make it
a little bit cheaper this is definitely
worth the money very impressed with
sleek makeup from trying this palette
and I'm excited because I just got some
more pellets my friend Candice actually
sent me a little sleek makeup set and it
has another a sleek makeup eye shadow
palette in there so I wanted to keep
playing with this one so I could get
this review out before I started playing
with the new ones but I'll definitely be
trying out more from the sleek makeup
eyeshadow palette I think that these are
really good quality and I was very
excited to find that the highlight that
I used in that video is from ELF
and this is oh it doesn't have it it
doesn't say on the packaging anymore but
it's a mermaid tail is the shade name
and it's one of their holographic
highlighters I think it's just what
they're called so it's basically you
have a two in different shades here and
if you can tell kind of when I push the
packaging back and forth that you can
see there's there's that bit of
holographic nough stew it I said in my
first impression video that I wasn't
necessarily like blown away by this I'm
not really a holographic highlight type
of girl I've been trying to go that
route and there's some that I do enjoy
but I think the reason why I didn't
necessarily fall in love with this is
because to me it wasn't like super
holographic but it's also not like a
standard typical highlight it kind of
like falls somewhere in between so I
either want like holographic or
iridescent are funky or I want a regular
highlight and this one's like kind of in
the middle like it you know it's like it
does it's not completely 100% sure what
it wants to be but I will say
I mixed the two colors in that video and
that was my favorite way to apply it if
I do just kind of like this paler color
over here or just the blue color
honestly it really barely shows up when
doing it that way I have to mix them
together and then you do get kind of
like a funky purple which is interesting
but again like that's just not what I'm
normally reaching for so this one I
didn't quite love it is elf it's
affordable you have a mirror which is
nice if that is your vibes I mean for
the five or six dollars that this is
from elf I think that you could like it
it just it wasn't a favorite of mine and
I don't know I just I was a little bit
underwhelmed by this guy but it will say
that I have another product here from
elf that I have been really enjoying
this is one of their liquid matte
lipsticks and this is in the shade a
praline I really do like these liquid
lipsticks they are I believe it's either
five or six dollars again so it's really
affordable for a liquid lipstick first
of all I love this color like this is my
kind of color I absolutely love kind of
that nude Brown kind of like a warm
brown I thought that was really nice I
also really enjoyed the applicator it
reminds me of the Smashbox oh it's on
liquid lipsticks and also the is that
the Mac retro matte liquid lipsticks
that have this type of applicator where
it's kind of like flat and then it's
pointy because I don't wear a lot of lip
liner so it's really easy to kind of
line my lips with this as well so I love
the color I love the applicator I will
say that it doesn't last forever and I
guess for a five dollar liquid lipstick
I guess I can't wear you know I found
paying like over twenty dollars I want
that look at lipstick to last forever
this one doesn't last the longest it is
fairly easy to reapply because it's not
super MOSI it's not the thinnest look
what looks like I've ever tried and I do
tend to prefer more thin almost kind of
a watery type liquid lipsticks I just
feel like they're really easy to reapply
if need it I don't like really moosie
ones and this one is not even really in
the middle it just has like a slight
slight bit of mousse enos to it but the
other downside to this one is that it is
pretty drying so when I was wearing it
for the full day when I was doing the
first impressions I noticed probably
within like three hours of wearing it I
was like
why did I look to feel so funny like I
couldn't quite figure out what was going
on and I was like oh my gosh they're dry
and I'm like oh man I wonder if it's you
know they look what lipstick so I've
been testing it out I mean I've worn
this probably at least 10 times trying
it out and I like it if I put some sort
of like lip balm underneath then it
helps with the drying or if I'm going
for a gloss mood I like having this on
and then I'll top it with a bit of gloss
because that way it also helps with the
dryness factor so I can't say it's my
favorite liquid lipstick ever I think
it's good and I think it's good for the
price if you don't mind a little bit of
drying or if you just prefer wearing lip
balms under your liquid lipstick anyways
I think that you could get along with it
but yeah those are some of my pros and
cons I mean obviously makeup as totally
personal preference so you know maybe I
said something in a con that the pro to
you or whatnot but those were kind of my
thoughts on the elf liquid lipstick
going over to my next a first impression
of Friday video the foundation that I
tried out in there was this new one from
NARS this is their natural radiant long
wear foundation it's a new foundation it
is $49 this was the first NARS
foundation that I was trying I have my
shade in Deauville I believe is how you
pronounce it and I actually did look and
see on the sephora website I don't know
if you guys know but if you create like
a profile with Sephora you can put in
there like what I did was one of my
first high-end foundations was the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation so
I went in there and selected that clinic
Foundation and then my shade and then it
will automatically shade match me to
whatever foundation I'm looking at on
the Sephora website so when I pull up
any sort of foundation immediately the
box with my like selected shade will pop
up right away which is really cool I
didn't know about that until fairly
recently so I thought I'd mention that
in case anyone's wondering and actually
it has me shade match to is it Punjab II
now I can't remember what it is but it's
actually three shades darker than this
one I did get this sent to me from NARS
which is super awesome and you know it's
not the best a shade match ever for me
but I can definitely make it work I was
wearing it in my latest will i buy it
video and you know i thought it was just
fine i just do some more contouring and
bronzing all that and i think it's
fine but I just thought I would mention
that because it was really cool to go in
there and see what actually is my
correct shade and it was because I
thought this was a little light so
technically it has me at three shades
darker than that one anyways moving on
from a shade selection because that's
not really what this is all about this
foundation I think again is good it
didn't turn into my favorite but I will
say that I liked it more than I thought
I did in the first impression video I
even made a comment in the first
impression video I said you know I'll
come back in a few weeks and let you
know how I like it
if I like it like I made sure to put it
if I like it cuz I was like I don't
really know if I enjoy this foundation
yet I felt like maybe it was kind of
sitting on my skin a little bit weird I
will say that I prefer using this one
with a Beauty Blender it's not
necessarily a super thick foundation
it's not like super thick or mattifying
it's a pretty decent full coverage I
would say it covers up a lot but it
doesn't look too heavy on the skin it
does also say it's radiant long-wear and
I don't know if I feel necessarily like
radiant or or dewy or anything like that
when I wear this and but I also don't
really lean matte at all how it says
it's natural like that's what I think I
think it just kind of looks like my skin
just like a little umph better but not
necessarily radiant and not necessarily
matte so that was something that I have
found it kind of interesting it is a
liquidy foundation it does say to shake
well and I do suggest that but again
sometimes with the more liquidy
foundations I prefer a brush to get a
little bit more coverage but with this
one I still prefer using a Beauty
Blender to blend it out $49 I do feel
like is you know pretty pricy for the
foundation but I actually as I've been
trying it more and more I really did
consider getting my correct shade range
purchasing it from Sephora I think maybe
if it were to like go on sale or if
Sephora was having some sort of discount
like if the vib sale was coming up I
honestly think that I would purchase
this in my correct shade because I still
do like it so I feel like that says
something too I still do like it I just
wanted to say that it didn't turn into
an absolute favorite I've been seeing
this mentioned and a lot of favorites
videos recently and it's just not a
favorite for me I just I think it's okay
but if you're someone who you don't
like a super radiant foundation you
don't like to be super mad at the same
time you kind of just want like your
skin but maybe a little bit smoothed out
like a little bit nicer looking cover
their imperfections I think that you
would really like this foundation just
for me personally what I prefer with
foundations I tend to like to look a
little bit more on the dewy side
especially right now because I am dry so
I think that's maybe something that's
not completely pulling me over to the
favorite side but I do still think it is
pretty good a little bit a product goes
a long way and yeah I'm still I have it
saved in my Sephora love's list I might
end up getting my correct shade of this
so moving on to the bronzer that I tried
there I tried this one from glamour
dolls in collaboration with a Lisa Frank
it's just called the bitten and bronzed
matte bronzer I still really do like
this bronzer it is still out of stock it
was out of stock when I filmed that
first impressions video it's still out
of stock this is only $4.99 which I
don't think is a bad price you get quite
a bit of bronzer as well you can just
see it's an matte bronzer it is a fairly
warm bronzer but sometimes I kind of
like that so I don't mind this bronzer
at all I think it applies really nicely
it's very easy to blend um it doesn't
look patchy at any point and even though
it is warmer I still don't feel like
there's some bronzers that are just so
pigmented you have to kind of make note
of that and make sure you go in with a
light hand and really build it up I
don't feel like I've ever really gotten
overboard with this bronzer so I really
did enjoy this one I wish I would come
back and stock I know a lot of people
have been really excited over this
bronzer and they're trying to get their
hands on it
if it does come back in stock I would be
able to recommend it I really do like it
I had a couple colour-pop at products in
there as well and again I reviewed these
in my bought Friday haul follow-up video
but the first one here is the color pop
brow pencil and this one is the oh it
doesn't say on here I think this is
called like their precision brow pencil
and I got mine in the shade dope taupe I
really enjoyed this pencil as well I
would say that I enjoyed the Maybelline
one more though if I had to choose since
I've been trying out a couple new brow
products recently I would actually
choose the Maybelline I do like the
color pop one though I don't like that
when you twist it up you cannot then
twist it down so I never want to twist
it up too far knowing I can't twist it
down so like as I'm doing my brows I
find myself
and it constantly having to keep pushing
that up it's something that's super
small but I don't you know I don't have
that with a lot of my other brow pencils
but the tip which again I don't want to
push up because then I can't put it down
it is really small and precise it kind
of reminds me of like the benefit
precisely my brow and it does have a
nice spoolie on the other end I believe
these are only five dollars which is
very affordable I do like the shade dope
dope for me but I feel like it maybe
pulls a little bit on the red side like
red Auburn side which I kind of noticed
right away as well and I really do think
that but I like it I think it's nice and
quick and easy to use I would repurchase
this again especially at only the $5 but
again if I'm comparing this in
Maybelline
I am preferring the Maybelline and then
the eyeshadow palette that I used in
that video was the dream Street palette
in collaboration with kathleenlights I
do like this eyeshadow palette I was
really excited when I did that first
impression video I loved the look I
created I was really excited over these
shades and I actually just mentioned
this one in my underwhelming makeup
products video because I was really
hyped for this palette and I love
kathleenlights and I think especially
the first time that I used it I was so
excited about it and then as I've been
continually using this I mean I've I've
played with this probably eight times I
want to say and as I've been playing
with it more I kind of realized that I
wasn't as hyped as I thought I was going
to be over this one but I do still like
it you know most of the products that I
mentioned in that underwhelming video I
like I just didn't end up like losing my
mind over like I thought I was going to
so I like this one the majority of the
shades are really nice there's a few
that don't quite show up to me and then
there was a few in here that I think are
maybe just kind of like too similar to
one another so I feel a little bit
limited in the makeup looks that I can
create but I really enjoyed the color
pop pressed a shadow formula I really
like their palettes again like I wish
they would come with a mirror like the
sleek makeup one is $13 it comes with
the mirror this one I believe was 16
dollars I would still recommend it for
the 16 dollars if you do like these
types of shades
they're nice and blendable and for the
majority they do work fairly well so I
still like it I didn't quite fall in
love with it like I thought I was going
to but it's still a nice affordable
eyeshadow palette and then the last
product that I
for the first impression follow-up video
is this mascara from I code this is the
lash alert mascara it says wake up and
go mascara it is I think it's $26 I want
to say on the alto website which is
pricey and I am not always a huge fan of
mascaras mostly because I wear false
lashes almost every single day so I very
rarely tend to reach for mascaras
especially higher priced mascaras
because it just doesn't always seem
worth it to me
mascaras you know go bad very fast and
you have to constantly be remembering
when you open them and discarding that
I'm at a good time and all of that so I
will say that about mascaras but this
one is pretty darn good it does give the
lashes a lot of length it doesn't really
do anything for a volume but if you have
nice thick lashes and you're always just
looking to make them a little bit longer
I think that you would like this mascara
I really did like the wand for this one
it has just a slight curve to it and
then it's kind of on the thin side but I
feel like it kind of gets right up in
there at the base of the lashes and
really like pulls it through and extends
and makes the lashes longer so I do like
all of that I just think $26 is kind of
high-priced
especially for me but it does say it
gives them volume curl and definition
and I don't really know if I mean I
don't see any sort of volume curl a
little bit like lengthen curl I would
say if that's what you're looking for in
a mascara I think you could find it for
this one but a lot of times if I'm not
wearing lashes and I am just going for
mascara I need something that gives me a
volume and length so this isn't
necessarily the one that I would reach
for but it was still decent it's just I
think gonna depend on what your mascara
needs are and if you're someone who is a
big mascara fan you might like this one
I just thought the $26 was a little bit
pricey but I thought this one was pretty
good but again not a favorite but after
that those are all the products that I
tried out in my recent first impression
videos re and that is everything for
this first impression Friday a follow-up
video I hope that you guys still enjoy
the follow ups I think they're really
important to do especially for first
impressions but also hauls so I love
being able to come back and give my
reviews on everything I'd love to know
what you thought from the first
impressions to the follow-up and now
review did anything surprise you have
you tried any of these products out
yourself and what do you think of them
but if you guys did enjoy the
video are you found helpful I hope that
you'll give it a thumbs up I hope that
you will also consider subscribing
