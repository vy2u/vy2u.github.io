today's video is going to be a a first
impression of Friday I have to make a
products here that I'm pretty curious
about and I thought we could test them
out together on camera so I have from
nude Stix one of their new tees tinted
blur stick I also did pick up a new
foundation this is the cover FX power
play foundation I also have the Becca
the Hydra mist set and refresh powder
I'm hearing a lot about this and then I
also just got a package from Molly
Beauty and they have some products in
here that I'm pretty curious about so I
have quite a few things to play with
and why don't we just go ahead and jump
into the video so typically I like to
start with my eyes but I have so many
products that I'm curious about for the
face that I'm just gonna go ahead and
jump into the face I've been doing
really minimal islands lately as well so
I don't know if that's what I'll do
today but I'm kind of leaning towards
that way but I have this new product
here from nude sticks and this is called
the nudies tinted blur and I did get in
here so I have a little sheet that I'm
looking at it says get real skin with a
natural tint that blurs to smooth
texture and even skin tone it says you
can kind of use it as like a tinted it
says tinted sheer coverage lightweight
face stick and it's supposed to give you
a natural appearance or you can use it
as a blurring primer under liquid or
powder or cream foundation you can use
them to highlight and contour etc I
believe these are $30 and they come in
10 different shades but I don't it's not
supposed to be like a foundation
foundation so I'm gonna wear it as like
a primer underneath the new foundation
that I got and I'm just I'm just curious
about these and I put them on my
Instagram the other day and a lot of
other people seem very curious about
them as well so this is what the nude
stick looks like and I chose my now in
the shade light 3 so we'll just go ahead
and see how this goes but I'm just gonna
kind of like swipe it onto the face and
then maybe kind of like blend it in with
a sponge I'm not really positive here
but so I'm just gonna kind of do that
I'm gonna do one side of my face just so
we can kind of get like a before and
after style also
since I'm using this as a primer I
didn't put down a primer so I I don't
know if that's the right thing to do
either but I also did just do a sheet
mask before I came on so I feel like I'm
pretty darn prime so I didn't feel like
I needed to do she passes in a primer
than this then if I did you let sound it
like a lot so I'm just gonna go ahead
and swipe along my face and then I'm
just gonna use the morphe sponge and I'm
just gonna kind of like blend it in see
how it goes
okay so I have the product blended out
on this side of my face and then I have
nothing on this side of my face so I
feel like it definitely gave me like a
tint I mean I definitely can see that on
my skin I'm not sure like it didn't
cover too much of my redness I have a
red mark right here I have a red mark
right here I still I feel like those are
still pretty evident on my skin I'm
trying to notice I have pretty large
pores right here let me zoom in a little
bit I have pretty large pores like right
here as well and I feel like those are
still pretty noticeable um so I don't
know I mean I'm like Hello zoomed in at
the moment but what do you guys think
one side to the other side I mean this
might be a product that maybe I have to
like try a few different times and try
to like get the hang off and all of that
and see which best ways to apply it but
I'm gonna apply it the nude stick to
this side as well
and I'm gonna use my fingers to blend it
out instead of a sponge just to see like
maybe that's the best way I didn't see
any like best tips of how to apply it to
the skin and what not and I was reading
reviews on the website and no one really
mentioned like how they applied it so I
don't know so I'm just gonna try to use
my fingers and apply it here it doesn't
feel like like it's easy to blend out
with my fingers so that's good but maybe
you know maybe this way or using a brush
would be a better way than than the
sponge we'll see okay so once again I
feel like I noticed that it gave a tint
to my skin I feel like it looks more
blurred out
this side so maybe just using your
fingertips would be the best way to
blurt out you know maybe this sponge was
like soaking up too much product on the
the right side of my face so maybe just
using finger tips would be best because
I definitely feel like I get more of a
blurred effect over here I don't have as
much going on with my skin on this side
I do still have like the area that I
have the largest pores is right here on
both sides of my face I feel like those
like better blended out I don't have as
much redness or like marks on the side
of my face either so this side has that
going for it so I noticed when I was
blending on this side the product was
kind of like I mean it almost looked
like it was like kind of flaking off my
skin so I'm not really sure what that's
about either I do have dry skin right
now but I don't know if you can see all
of this like dryness right here I mean
my dry skin isn't as bad as it has been
because it's not as cold outside now
which is great I also just use a sheet
mask right before this and I usually
have like zero troubles with dry patches
when I do use a sheet mask like directly
prior to applying makeup so I'm a little
bit thrown by that not sure what that's
all about but like I mean that doesn't
look very cute and as I'm kind of like
blending with my finger I'm just getting
those patches like flaking off and
flaking into my hair and stuff I'm gonna
try to keep in mind that this is a first
impression I'll play with this a little
bit more I also haven't seen anybody
else apply this I haven't seen any
videos on it nothing about it so it
definitely could be a user error in some
sort of way maybe I do need to use a
regular primer but like I said I used a
sheet mask so I I I don't know I'll try
it a couple different ways of course
this is the first impression so I'll
come back in about two weeks and review
everything that I'm about to try out in
this video but I like that it kind of
you know did a little tint for me and
that was nice but I don't know what I
think about this off first impression
it's a different project for me so again
I just I keep wanting to say like it
could be user error because I don't I
don't normally gravitate towards things
like this I don't usually use them in my
collection but I don't I'm feeling
conflicted so I'm going to move on to
foundation and this one might be a
little tough like well
we're gonna try not to judge the
foundation too harshly because I am
using the the tinted movie stick under
this as well instead of how I would
regular primer so I'm definitely gonna
try this out several ways as well but
this is from a cover effects of the
powerplay foundation so I purchased the
Sunday Riley foundation the influencer
in the support vib sale I did not like
it I did return it I do have my review
up so I will have that video listed down
below but when I went in I actually just
exchanged it for this one which now that
I'm looking at it looks fairly light I
got mine in the shade P 40 they have I
think like 4 different undertones
believe this was a $44 is long-wearing
it's buildable medium to full coverage
with a breathable weightless finish and
so we'll go ahead and give this a shot
we'll see if I like it better than the
Sunday Riley influencer because I really
did not like that foundation which
phoned me out so this is kind of like a
squeeze tube here and then I'm just
gonna apply some to my morphe sponge and
see how we do okay my camera overheat it
as I was blending it out so I have it
all planned it out on my skin and I try
to zoom in close so you can see what my
skin looks like I really like this like
I'm really really liking it I do like my
shade match I wasn't sure if I would I
do like it but I think my skin looks
really good now now is it the nude
sticks primer or is it the foundation
that's what I'm gonna have to be testing
out over these next couple weeks if it's
the nude sticks primer that would be
really cool maybe that would be
something that I wouldn't be able to use
by itself which is kind of what I was
hoping for going into the summer but if
it would make a nice primer that would
be cool too but I just feel like my skin
looks really nice I immediately got good
coverage so that was what made me upset
with the Sunday Riley especially it said
it was medium to full and it was not it
was like light to maybe medium this
definitely gave me the coverage it
covered up those red spots my skin like
it doesn't look too matte it says it's a
modern matte finish and I don't feel
like my skin looks too matte it still
feels hydrated it doesn't feel like I
have too much foundation on oh I like
this a cover effects I have high hopes
for you
be testing it out like crazy so I can
review it in the next coming weeks here
I don't have a new concealer so I'm just
gonna go ahead and apply my Urban Decay
Naked skin and then set my face with
Becca I want to make sure I have all my
liquids on before I come in with any
powders okay I'm gonna try reign in my
excitement but next up I'm going to use
this Becca
Hydra mist set and refreshed powder I
got this unto me from optilead and
Becca's thank you so much because I've
been starting to hear a lot of really
good things about this and I'm super
curious about it so this is $38 it's
available now so when you twist the cap
off you have this guy here and there's a
sticker on it says keep me closed to
keep me cool because a lot of people are
saying it feels really cool and it
almost feels like it's wet when you
apply it to the skin you pop that top
open this is what the product looks like
I'm just gonna continue to use my sponge
I've seen some people use a sponge I've
seen some people use a brush I see some
people use it under their eyes and then
all over their face so I don't know I
get a first I'm gonna start with my
under eyes just to see and a lot of
people are saying like a little bit goes
a long way so like I'm gonna start I
even feel like that's too much I'm gonna
start with a little bit on my sponge
here going to go ahead and dab it on my
under eyes it definitely does feel
cooling I'm also using a sponge versus a
brush I definitely can feel that cooling
sensation people have been talking about
like that is a very fine powder you know
usually when you bake and you have that
like stripe of powder that you have to
you know dust away I feel like that just
like sunk right in and it looks really
smooth like my under eye looks very very
smooth and kind of like lifted and just
whoo-whoo okay okay let's do the other
eye so you're supposed to be able to use
this to a set makeup and then also it
says you can reapply throughout the day
- like rejuvenate and refresh the skin
so that's pretty interesting
I feel like it makes my under eyes look
really nice though like I feel a man I
really do like that so I'm gonna add
just a little bit more to my sponge and
kind of just a set into my face I have
been using more setting powders lately
so I don't want to get like too crazy
though so I'm just gonna kind of like
tap it in areas and then I'm just
go ahead and pounce that into the skin
to set that foundation okay I feel like
my skin is looking all kinds of nice
between you know maybe it's the primer
the foundation and now this powder I
feel like my skin looks really nice it
looks really smooth I feel like it looks
very flawless now it looks I mean I feel
like it even looks hydrated it doesn't
look too matte oh my gosh I'm really
happy with this with this combination
this trio we got going on here those are
the three products that honestly I was
like super super curious about I want to
go on to this moly Beauty palette
because I'm really curious about it so
this is called Hollywood they have a new
collection that's out and it's also
available at Sephora now but I'm curious
about this one because it also does come
with a contour shade so you have six
highlights over here and then you have a
contour and a highlight shade so I am
gonna use this as my eye palette but I'm
gonna go ahead and use this contour
shade first and then I'll do a few
things off camera so we can kind of
speed along and all of that so this
palette is $29 like I said it's also
available at Ulta now it has a mirror in
it as well and I really like palettes
that that are a little bit more than
just like an eyeshadow palette so I'm
gonna go ahead and take the iconic shade
and I'm gonna use the Sigma fo6 just a
small brush here and I'm just gonna use
this to contour Wow okay so that came
out pretty pigmented right away it gets
sent this package from moly beauty in PR
and I was pretty excited about it cuz I
don't think I've tried anything from
Molly Beauty so I mean I don't know if
it was the combination of that just the
packaging you know is super cute on
everything the pink and the gold and the
sparkly but it just caught my attention
right away so I thought it would be
perfect to add in a couple of the items
here into this first impression video I
think so far so good with that contour
shade I mean contour is like it's not
life or death in my makeup routine but I
do like a nice contour and that in one
came out pretty pigmented and I thought
it blend it really well also so so far
so good I don't have a new bronzer or
like a brow product to use so I'm going
to go ahead and do those steps
off-camera and then we'll come back and
get started in on the eyes with this
palette pretty so I went ahead and added
my bronzer also my brows and I have my
eyelids ready to go so again I'm going
to be using the Molly Molly wood palette
and they went ahead and swatched out the
palette as well so here's all of the
shades inside this last one here is more
of like a chunky like pressed glitter
into the palette this one right here so
you can kind of tell looking at it that
it's more of that like chunky glitter
which I don't gravitate towards them a
ton I feel like they're kind of hard to
work with and honestly just kind of like
a looking at the swatches and looking in
the palette you know I don't have that
like real artistic mind in here so I'm
kind of like struggling with a color
combination because I feel like it could
lean one way but then it could lean
another way but they don't like I feel
like I can't get a whole look at it
what's in here I don't know if that
makes any sense but like this is where
my mind goes but I'm just gonna try so
I'm gonna pick up this shade fabulous
here which looks to be like a really
nice peach color I've been really into
peach recently I'm gonna use the Sigma
e35 it's a tapered blending brush and so
I can tell right when I put my brush in
there I did get quite a bit of kick up
in there so I'm just gonna make sure to
really tap off my brush good sometimes
you get a lot of kick up in the palate
and it doesn't translate into like tons
of solid on your face but because I did
to my face first I just kind of want to
like make sure that we're all good so
I'm just gonna go ahead and apply this
into the crease and just kind of run it
all over the eyes like I said I've been
doing like really simple ilex recently
it's mostly been focusing on my face and
just having like a really nice base and
really glowy dewy skin and a nice
highlight and all of that and I've been
keeping my eyes more simple so that's
kind of the vibe that I want to maybe do
here today as well okay this one has
more of like a sheen to it I thought it
was maybe more of like a matte but it
almost has like it's almost like a
peachy dual chrome or something so I'm
just gonna kind of apply it all over the
lid and just make sure it looks blended
on the crease but huh even from the
swatch I don't know I thought it was
gonna be more matte but that's okay so I
think flirty has a bit of a sheen to it
as well so the only other like real
matte in here is this deep red one and I
don't
like that's not really what I'm going
for so I'm gonna pick up a little bit of
flirty I'm gonna use the firm blender
from Sigma which is the e 44 and I'm
just gonna kind of first pack this on
the outer part of the eye yet so that
one has a sheen as well okay I don't
really know how you would make a full
look from this palette but hmm I don't
know about this look so we're just gonna
go for like a summer shimmer peachy kind
of purple eye look I have no idea where
this was going but then I was really
thrown through a loop in that first
peach shade ended up being so shimmery
but um that's okay it's just makeup we
can wash it off no big deal so I'm just
kind of packing this one all over the
lid and then just kind of again making
sure it's blended as well so I'm just
gonna blending those two colors together
and seeing seeing what we're getting old
boy this is why I'm not an artist I will
say that I have zero fallout on my face
which is awesome so that's fantastic
this is where I'm going to leave the
eyes for right now just the color
combinations in here are just kind of
throwing me through a loop I'm not the
best looking at a palette and thinking
of a look like that so I'm just kind of
like being thrown and really I'm not
wearing a lot of dark colors on my eyes
right now so I'm not gravitating towards
these dark shades and I just don't
really love chunky glitter so I was
gonna try to come up with something
without using those ones but um well
just sometimes you just need to finish a
look to have it all come together you
know what I'm saying don't panic yet
Samantha I just added some of my Urban
Decay heartless liner into my waterline
and then I'm gonna finish off the lower
lash line so I think that I'm actually
gonna grab this iconic color the contour
color I'm gonna grab that one first and
just run it on my lower lash line with a
morphe pencil brush and then I'm
actually gonna add this gold on the
lower lash line as well this is in
fierce I mean purchase really gonna do
the most right now it's grabbed another
pencil brush and I'm just going to play
that cool
fold to the lower lashline and see how
that looks don't mind that don't mind
not I'm gonna add the Molly Beauty
mascara as well this is the smokey mama
mascara and it's $20 I've also not been
doing lashes as much lately ooh I've got
a sparkly top too
and we've been doing lashes as much
lately I've been spending a lot of time
outside and it's fairly warm here and I
like to go to like the park with my dog
and all that so I've just been doing
mascara most days so that's what I'm
gonna continue to do today so I'm just
gonna go ahead and add this to my top
and bottom lashes what the wand looks
like so it looks like a wand that would
make me be better for lengthening I
usually like length and volume but let's
go ahead and see this mascara is
actually really really nice it doesn't
do the absolute most for volume areas
this join next move you hear it doesn't
do the absolute most for volume but it
does enough that I like it and it does
really really good things for
lengthening I really like the way my
bottom lashes look my top lashes look
really nice my eyes look more open and
awake hey that's pretty darn cool just
to finish off the eyes I'm gonna use the
highlight shade in here which is called
fearless and the morphe 36 so I'm just
gonna grab a little bit of that and I'm
gonna dust that on the inner part of my
eye I'm just gonna take what's left on
my brush and just highlight the brow
bone
real quick nothing so that's gonna be it
for the eyes I think they came out
better than I was thinking that they
would I just feel like this is kind of
what I'm doing right now very simple
nothing too like dark like I'm just more
unlike spring waters here I want to have
spring makeup type of vibes okay okay
let's move on and finish off the face so
they also have this highlighting blush
here and when I opened it up I thought
it was really interesting because it
kind of reminds me of the new one from
Mac they really something that looks
really similar to this it does have a
mirror as well and this guy is a $28 so
you have this interesting mixture of all
of these different shades so I'm just
gonna kind of sweep my brush through it
because I'm not really sure what to do
I'm going to use the Sigma f40 so I'm
just gonna kind of like do one of these
I'm gonna try to stay away
from this right here which looks to be
like the really highlighting shade and
just kind of get a mixture of those
blushes and pop it on the cheeks and see
what we get I don't know if I really
understand blushes like this because I
can also see that I did get some of that
highlight in there and I don't know I'm
gonna try to like hit my brush and like
these two right here and do it on the
other side and see how that turns out
that looks pretty good I just I don't
fully understand these and how they work
and where I'm supposed to put my brush
and all of that but yeah I think that
looks pretty good they do have a
highlight palette as well and it has
three different shades in it this first
one is actually more of a cream and then
these two are powders but I'm actually
going to leave that alone for the moment
and I'm gonna go back into Mollywood and
use that highlighter cuz I kind of
wanted to use as much as I could out of
this palette um so I'm just gonna take
that fearless highlighter I'm gonna take
a fan brush the f42 from Sigma and I'm
just gonna kind of sweep that along the
cheekbones ooh that's really pretty well
it it's nothing I just kind of like
casually dipped my fan brush in here and
dang that is really beautiful all right
so that is going to do it for all of the
first impressions today I'm gonna spray
my face and add a lip color and valuate
myself and come back to wrap it up hey
guys spread my face I added some of my
senti gloss balm I've been doing a lot
more gloss these days as well again I
just think it's it's kind of my mood
right now with the spring weather I'm
liking a little bit more of like a
lighter makeup and all that fun stuff
but this is the final look for today's
first impression Friday video so I
wanted to go over everything quickly
that I use so the nude sticks nudies
tinted blur stick this is probably the
product that I'm feeling the most
conflicted on because I didn't love how
it looked by itself but once I put my
foundation on I'm not sure if I just
love the foundation that much or if this
is really helping it so I'll definitely
try the foundation with this again
without it
I'll try other foundations with this so
I can kind of get a better feel for it I
like that it gave me a bit of a tint and
run used my fingers I definitely noticed
more of the blurring effect but it did
kind of cover as much redness as I'd
want to so I don't think I'd be able to
use this on its own as just like a
tinted you know lightweight product I
would want to put something over it but
we'll see um I keep trying because I'm
very curious about it the foundation
though I'm really really happy with I
mean I've been filming now it takes me a
really long time to film these videos so
I've been filming for over two hours at
this point and since I put the
foundation on pretty quickly I've had it
on for almost two hours and I still
think my skin looks really good
I like the coverage it gave me I like
that it wasn't too matte I played it
with the sponge I'll try a few different
ways a few different primers I'll see
how it wears on all of that but first
impression I'm really happy with this
one so fingers crossed I got a good one
Becca Hydra blur Hydra mist a set and
refreshed powder okay I really like this
one as well I felt like I could
immediately see a difference when I
applied it to my under eyes it like so
smooth and then I just kind of very
lightly put it all over my face as well
you just saw me but damn I'm just kind
of lightly applying it and again I feel
like my skin looks really really nice
right now so I'm really happy about that
it feels nice and lightweight on the
skin as well like I said it didn't have
that kind of cooling cooling feel to it
as well but I'm excited to keep trying
this one I'm very curious about it I'm
hearing really good things so I'll be
giving my full review in the next couple
weeks here but for the Molly beauty
products that I tried at the Molly wood
eyeshadow palette I don't know how much
I'm going to gravitate towards it
especially right now I just kind of feel
like with some of these darker shades in
here like even you know that gold is
pretty deep the deep Brown you know kind
of like this red burgundy color and then
even the glitter it's kind of giving me
more like fall vibes and not necessarily
it's spring/summer and like this is you
know I like this lighter makeup eye
makeup look right now so I don't know
how much use I'll get out of it or how
often I'll be reaching for it just
because of the colors that are in here
but I like that it's got the contour
shade and the highlight shade in here
and I think both of those worked really
well the highlight I especially think is
super stunning I think that looks
beautiful the shades that I did use I
mean they were easy to apply to the eyes
I didn't have any problem with any fall
out on my face or anything like that
again I just obviously I had troubles
coming up with a color combination for
my eyes I feel like I can see a darker
look with this but it's just not what
I'm
for at this moment so I don't know we'll
see I'll try this a few more times and
I'll try out those darker shades and let
you know what I think but that was the
Mollywood eyeshadow palette the mascara
I'm very impressed with if you're
someone who likes a lengthening mascara
I think that you would really like it
but even if you do need a little bit of
volume in there - I thought this one was
really nice I liked that the wand was
really thin because I felt like I could
get right at the base of my lashes and
really boost my lashes up so I'm pretty
happy with this one and I'm not a
mascara fan because I prefer my false
lashes but like I said I've been
skipping those more these days the blush
I'm not a huge fan of because I don't
quite I don't quite get blushes like
this but if you do and you are more
well-versed and blushes like this you
might like it but I just feel like it's
hard to I feel like it's hard to know
what color of a blush I'm going to get
on my cheeks and obviously each one is
so small you can't really put your brush
in there but it said it's you know how
its formulated is that you're supposed
to be able to just like sweep it across
and sweep on the the cheeks but that's
not really my favorite style so I'm not
again I'm not sure how much I would
actually reach for this one I feel like
I would go with my you know more normal
style blushes to me but it ended up
looking ok just took me a while to blend
out so I wasn't like clown like with the
blush but I do like that it has the
mirror and it feels like pretty sturdy
packaging and I think the whole
Mollywood the collection looks really
cute for packaging wise but that is
gonna be everything for today's first
impression Friday video check back in a
couple weeks I'll have my full reviews
on all of these products but I thought
it would be fun and sit down and try out
some of these on camera so let me know
