today's video is going to be a meal
first impression Friday I feel like I
haven't done a first impression in a
while so today I'm going to be testing
out some new makeup I have the festival
pilot from dubious place the bomb new
liquid highlights new primer blur stick
primer from milk and a few other items
so I'm excited to be trying these out so
if you're ready for a new first
impression Friday when we go ahead and
get started
alright I come by my ears so I just
pulled my hair up got two zoomed in so
like I said I do have the festival
palette here by dubious place this is
the new eyeshadow that they came out
with here's what the inside looks like I
had my friend Ellie send this to me and
I was so excited when I opened it I
think all I could say was like wow I
mean wow did a tutorial with the deuce a
deuce palette the other day we creating
the Babs Beauty Valentine's Day makeup
look and I really really liked the
palette so I'm excited for this one but
I'm also very very terrified at the same
time I say that I'm not I'm not the best
looking at a palette and coming up with
a look like that but we're gonna we're
just gonna try something today and see
what happens I did swatch everything so
I could put a photo on Instagram so I'll
go ahead and insert that swatch photo so
you can see what all of the shades will
look like and I stared at them on my arm
for a really long time like okay so so
figure it out girlfriend and I'm still
here like what am I going to do so the
names I feel like are going to be super
super hard for me to pronounce it so
I'll just point to what I'm gonna use
I'm gonna come in with this shade first
which is kind of like a peachy orange II
type of shade and I'm gonna use the
blending brush from bdellium tools one
of my favorites blending brushes at the
moment I do have my eyes prime and then
I also did set them with a powder so I'm
going to just lay this one into the
crease the outer part of the eye I
really have no idea what I'm doing but
we're gonna give something a shot here
and if it doesn't work out it's just
makeup and we will all survive I have a
good feeling about it guys I have a good
feeling we'll all survive now you can
feel like about the makeup look but that
we're gonna survive it all so as I lay
this one down if you notice that like
I'm squinting like crazy it is because
we got six inches of snow last night
okay six inches that's just completely
unnecessary and it's so bright outside
I usually just film in front of my big
window in my office and I actually I
always have like my blinds up I put the
blinds down and I also have them at
turned like instead of being open I have
them almost completely halfway closed
and I'm still shoved as far back as I
can go in my office and it's still so
bright in here that I'm like oh so if
you notice me squinting that's why if
you ever noticed me squinting like in
the beginning of my videos it's because
I'm trying to get used to looking
directly outside because normally I'm
turned looking at my computer so it's
totally different when all this and it's
like whoa it's so bright I move over and
pick up a smaller brush this one is just
from morphe and I'm gonna grab with the
center shade here which is this kind of
like magenta pink when i swatched it it
didn't seem like it had as much
intensity as I maybe thought looking at
it in the palette but that was just a
swatch so I don't know so I'm still
gonna go pretty light hand it and tap my
brush off and I'm gonna work this on the
outer part of the eye I've been really
into these pink looks lately so I wanted
to incorporate pink in here somehow and
I really didn't wanna like I wanted to
try to challenge myself to go more than
just my like a basic look because there
is this like a nice shimmer right here
kind of like a gold shimmer I was like
yeah you can just use the gold shimmer
and I was like no try to use some colors
just give it give it a shot so it's what
I'm gonna try to do when there's
basically no color left on the brush I'm
just gonna kind of sweep it in along the
crease and blend it out this might be
where it gets a little weird but I'm
like really attracted to this color and
I want to use it and it's just kind of
like mustard yellow over here I'm just
gonna try it on the lid and see what it
looks like this could be really bad or
it could be cool I don't know I don't
know how it's gonna combine with the
pink but we're gonna give it a shot I'm
gonna use the sigma e55 shader brush
I'm just going in to tap this on to the
lid this was another one when i swatched
it it didn't seem like it had maybe like
as much impact that I would have thought
looking at it in the palette but I'll
just still take my time and kind of
build it up here I got so far I'm not
100% how I feel yet and I feel like so
funny when I was reading the comments on
using every shade and a palette
challenge you know there's so many other
people out there that are better than me
then coming up with color combos no
sunny reading some of the comments cuz
people are like I wish I could it'd be
like telling you as you were doing it
like put this there put that there I'm
like yeah I wish you could have too and
it's so funny because sometimes I read
comments and and people say like oh I
wish you wouldn't like put yourself down
or like give yourself a hard time and I
totally don't envision me saying that
like I don't have that artistically
creative mind like I'm not great at
coming up with looks on myself I
genuinely don't feel like that's me
putting myself down it's just the truth
I mean it just is what it is it's just
it's like me saying I'm bad at math I
just M no I'm not I'm not trying to put
myself down there or anything like that
it's just staying facts then I was never
into art I used to cry having to go to
art classes like in middle school and
such I would cry because I just I
couldn't get it no matter what it was we
were working on I could not get it and I
remember especially in middle school I
was thinking that the teacher was so
mean to me because I would get so upset
because I'd want to do good and I'd want
to try but I just there's something in
there that just does not click and I
would hate hate going to art class so
much
oh are you putting myself down and truly
I don't think it is it's just me saying
like that's not something I'm good at
and that's okay I also can't parallel
park totally fine I can write a book
can't parallel park like maybe I don't
hate what we got going on here so I'm
just going to take that more if you
brush and then kind of blend it I feel
like maybe once sometimes like makeup
looks when I start to do them I'm like
ah not so good but then like as things
come together the eye looks come
together and the face comes together I
don't mind it as much but I still feel
like I want to do one
I want to do something else but I mmm
okay I think I'm just gonna let it hang
out here right now what the eyes and I
feel like maybe as I start to build the
face maybe I'll get an idea of if
there's something else I should do with
my lid or maybe I should just do
something really fun on the lower
lashline not a hundred percent but
that's what I'm gonna do for now with
this palette but we'll definitely be
coming back to it but I'm gonna switch
over now it's my face alrighty so for my
face primer I'm gonna try this new milk
makeup luminous blur stick so this is a
new product from milk makeup it's $36
and it is available now and this is what
it looks like so it's the same concept
as their original blur stick except that
this one is supposed to leave a luminous
glow to the skin but I thought it was
interesting because it does say that it
gives a luminous finish but at the same
time it says that it's matte so I was
like I never understand when they say
luminous and matte I just watched some
of my hands I don't know you'll be able
to see it great on camera but go ahead
and give this a shot I'm just gonna
apply it to my face and see how we do
like I would normally the blur stick
which I do really like the blur stick
from milk makeup so we'll see if I like
the luminous one wow it really is a
luminizing I'm just going to take my
fingers and kind of rub it around here
and see what I think like I said I do
like the blur stick and I'm super super
dry right now so I I like to be looking
luminous so we'll see if this one works
out for me so right off the bat I feel
like it did bring luminosity to the skin
I could see that right like as I sure I
could see it but I don't necessarily
notice a time maybe a little bit of
blurring but when I use the original
milk makeup Blair stick like I can tell
a difference right away I don't know if
I noticed as much with this one a little
bit of a blur effect but nothing too
crazy but that's what it looks like
honest so I will do a follow-up of
course to my first impression
I always come back and do a follow-up in
a couple weeks I did do a makeup haul I
think it was posted last week I'll have
that link down below and it was a pretty
small haul so I think I'm actually gonna
combine the haul with this first
impression video so in a couple weeks
check back because I'll be reviewing
everything that I got from Sephora and
Ulta and then also all the products that
I try in this one because first
impressions is really hard to actually
review item before foundation I don't
know if this is a new new product I
don't think it is everything else is
fairly new to the market but this is the
Becca ultimate coverage complexion creme
I did get this sent to me from octoly
which I was pretty excited about I was
sent the shade buttercup
so we shall see if that works but I was
excited about it when I saw it I was
kind of like oh I don't know if I want
to like put in an order proposal for it
because I have so many foundations but
then I started seeing people reviewing
it and a lot of people had good things
to say so I do want to give it a try I
did think it was interesting because I
was reading about it and it says that
it's ultimate coverage which to me means
like full coverage right but then it
says it's also lightweight and very
buildable so we shall see because full
coverage isn't my absolute favorite but
I don't know I felt like I was getting
kind of like conflicting things I don't
know if my shade match is gonna be great
because I did just self tan yesterday so
I don't know how this is gonna go but
I'm just gonna do a few pumps here on my
morphe sponge and apply it to my face i
soft hand for i filmed my willy by a
video yesterday and I had self tanned
and it had been like two hours and as I
was watching the video I was like oh man
you can totally tell that the self
tanner was kicking in and I even wore a
shirt that was like high up it had like
a cowl neck or why not to try to hide
the fact that I was probably gonna be
changing colors in the video but yeah I
sure was so I'm just gonna blend this in
with the morphe sponge so I mean right
away I can tell it's full coverage like
wow I think it's gonna be a little bit
too yellow for my skin tone which is
kind of a bummer but that's okay we'll
keep going keep trying okay so it
blended out pretty easily it didn't take
too much time to blend and I felt like
it covered everything really well I had
some blemishes on my forehead here and
then
on the chin area and it covered all of
those really well with just I mean I
would say I did like one and a half
pumps it it appeared to be a very
liquidy foundation so I didn't need a
ton and that looks pretty darn full
coverage to me again I don't think the
shade match is the best ever of the life
but we can maybe somehow get away with
it it'll be okay
I'm actually kind of diggin the claims
of it being lightweight too because
sometimes with full coverage it just
sits like it's too heavy on my skin like
it gets cakey and weird and lines and
stuff I'm like trying to show you guys I
don't have Botox like but it seems to be
actually looking really nice on the skin
look pretty good even around my nose
area I mean I did just apply it so like
can't get too excited but even around my
nose area it's still looking pretty good
so hey that's not too bad I'll be
excited to see how it wears and like I
said of course I'll come in to do
follow-up video in the next couple weeks
here good so far so I don't have like
concealer anything like that I think the
next step would be highlight so I'm
actually gonna finish off the rest of my
face and then we'll come back in with
the dubious plays palette to finish off
the eyes before we keep going so BRB
ready so I have some more of my face
done I have my brows on and I didn't do
lashes or anything because I still feel
like there's something that I want to do
with this palette but this this color
combination is really hard for my skills
but I think I'm gonna take the orange
and this is where we could really like
mess things up here but I'm gonna take
some of this orange on a sigma small
tapered blending brush it's an e 45 and
I'm gonna like put it into the crease
cuz like I like the look that I have
here but I still feel like there could
be something more especially with such a
colorful palette I just can't figure out
what it is so I'm just gonna kind of
like put that into the crease and see
what happens
we're just a little bit more and I'm
trying to keep my brush like flat down
instead of like up to make sure it
doesn't get too high I'm kind of like
bringing it out as well and then also
putting it on the outer V kind of where
we did the paint gets
turning it like a cool color I like that
color it's like a starburst or something
okay so I don't feel like that changed
it a ton but I still like it it kind of
gave a different dimension to the pink
out here and then we still have a little
bit of pink that fades on the inner so I
actually kind of like that so that's
what I'm gonna keep it I know such a big
difference I know you guys really
getting crazy over here
whoa I'm just repeating on the other eye
I really do like the yellow shade in
here though I think that one is pretty
cool I'm just gonna pack a little bit
more yellow on to the lid just to make
sure we don't lose that and the process
of adding another color there I feel
like we kind of have like starburst
sunset eyes what do you think hi today
I'm not mad I'm not mad at it I'm not
mad at it at all so hey hey we did
something we tried we tried some funky
colors in this palette we saw there did
the lower lash line too we still could
get even crazier hanket right so I would
just say a little bit of mascara for now
and some brown liner to my waterline I
am gonna do lashes but I'm gonna wait so
my camera starts to overheat again I try
to get like as much done and then my
camera overheats for a while and then I
do other things like pop on lashes
because that takes me longer but I'm
gonna finish off the lower lash line
while I still have some in charge left
so I'm not really sure what I'm gonna do
here but I think first I'm going to come
in with the pink let's go with the pink
and I use the Sigma II 15 a plus definer
brush and I'm going to push this up on
the lower lash line and maybe just focus
this one on kind of like the outer part
of the eye and I'm going to grab the
orange I'm going to use the same brush
I'm going to put that one like middle
inner part of the eye want to pick up
this shade here on the top middle with a
smaller brush this one I think is a lip
brush yet so Sigma lo4 and I'm going to
put that into the inner corner cuz this
one looked really fun and poppin right
so I think that's gonna do it for my eye
what do you guys think I mean I used a
lot of color especially for me but I
really like the way that it turned out
I'm diggin it you guys can let me know
to think and all that good stuff but the
festival palette by Julius place I hope
you guys enjoyed seeing a bit of a
colorful look from me don't do a ton but
I like it so I'm gonna go ahead and pop
lashes on and then we'll finish off with
some highlight and lip color okay so now
I just need to finish off the face I'm
going to use these new highlights from
the balm they sent me over at the
mary-lou manizer and then also bonnie
and do manizer so I haven't even watched
these so I wanted to check these out
mary lou manizer was my very first ever
highlight that i purchased so i was
pretty excited to get this from the balm
it was like it was like ooh la but let
me tell you but let me go ahead this is
what the applicator looks like yeah that
looks like that looks like mary lou
manizer in a liquid form it sure does
alright there is Mary it did also send
me a second a set of these so I'm going
to be doing a Instagram giveaway so if
you're not following me yet on Instagram
that's we're gonna be doing that
giveaway I've been trying to do I always
try to do my giveaways on all of my
different platforms stay tuned because
YouTube we got we got something coming
up for you YouTube but I really try to
do snapchat I need to do a Twitter one
Instagram YouTube I tried to do it off
so there is Bonnie next to Mary so funny
is definitely more gold so I'm going to
use Mary so let's give this a try I'm
not a like I'm just more of a powder
highlight kind of girl so we'll see how
this goes I'm just going to kind of Pat
some and then I'm gonna use my sponge to
blend it out like and get it blended out
okay I feel like it just made us stripe
on my face I watched Chris and Dominique
this morning and she used this and it
didn't look like that so what I thought
I was doing what she did you know I'll
try again
well like space him out more or
something
this is why I stick with my powder
highlights cuz I don't know what I'm
doing okay that looks a little bit
better oppa better til there is one
cheek with mary-lou manizer again I'm
just I'm not really the best at these
type of highlights but I wanted to give
up much RIE so I thought maybe I might
like fall in love but I think my powder
highlights are still gonna be my jam but
let's see how I do on the other side
maybe I'll do a little bit better here
so I recommend I mean I do use liquid
highlights I have in my life I recommend
doing one side and then the other
because I feel like they can kind of dry
fast so that's my little recommendation
I feel like I did better on that side so
that's good it might just be something
that I have to kind of like play around
with for a while you know kind of like
get the hang of it since I'm typically
using powder but I'm gonna do just a
little bit like that's not a little bit
Samantha okay
good you go girl you go girl take my
sponge again typically do the bridge of
my nose and also like the tip of my nose
when highlighting I kind of I kind of
stopped highlighting everywhere like you
know my forehead I mean some days I do
sometimes if I'm feeling it I will but
especially with it just being like so
like winter and like crummy like I just
don't feel like I'm like I have the
glowing skin everywhere I'm like I'm
cold and dry and miserable over here but
you know so I'm gonna leave it like this
right now I think you could probably
like build it up and play with it some
more but honestly I'm pretty intimidated
by these so I will I will just work on
and keep playing with them and you know
come back with the follow-up but if you
guys love liquid highlights I mean these
do look pretty and all of that these are
fourteen fifty so I'll keep trying them
out and maybe I'll give Bonnie a try too
but I'll keep trying them out I think
mary-lou manizer is gonna be my favorite
either - maybe layering the mary
loumanizer regular highlight could be
pretty as well but what do you guys
think were you interested in you saw
that they were coming out with these let
us know but that is oh my hell it looks
like and finally for my lip color to
finish off the look I'm gonna try one of
the new pixie matte
a liquid lip I picked up the shade
pastel petal pastel pedal yeah they did
send these over to me these are $14 a
piece I think it is so I'm gonna go
ahead and give this a shot I've been
hearing really good reviews about this
one so I'm gonna go ahead and try it
this is what the applicator looks like
it looks similar to me to these smashbox
always on liquid lipstick so let's go
ahead and see a scent to it not too bad
not too overpowering but that one on
really smoothly i really like the way it
applied I really like the applicator it
was very pigmented it went on super
smoothly I really really like this color
it's a beautiful nude has a slight
fragrance to it but nothing at too
overwhelming I'm going to let it dry
down and then see if it transfers
because it does say Matt laughs a liquid
lip so I feel like this should dry down
all the way so I'm gonna give it a few
minutes I'm gonna go ahead and spray my
face and then we'll see how this dries
down hmm I do still see a little tiny
little bit of transfer there so I've
been letting it sit for a while though
so maybe it's just one of those that
takes even longer to dry down or maybe
they won't dry down completely Julie all
the way and I'll just get like slight
slight transfer I really like this color
and I feel like it looks really pretty
on the lips so I'm excited to try some
of these out like I said I've been
hearing really good reviews about them
so I've been wanting to try them for
sure again there are $14 so I will have
everything of course that I use a listed
below but then after the lip color then
that is going to do it for my first
impression Friday I was gonna do it for
today's that first impression Friday
trying out some new makeup products I
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
I'm running quickly through everything
that I used the festival palette by
dubious place I get a huge thank you to
Ellie for sending this to me I was
really excited to try it I will say that
I'm slightly intimidated by the palette
if you weren't a big colorful person
makeup wise you might get a little
bewildered looking at this guy which I
definitely was but what I noticed too is
that even though these shades are super
bright they do take a while to build up
on the eyes which is good for me because
if you just go in and like plop a shade
down on your eyelid
and it's too bright and too pigmented it
can be really really hard to blend out
and then you can kind of have a mess so
I actually enjoyed the fact that they
weren't quite as pigmented as they might
seem in the pans and then it's easier to
build up that way so I personally did
enjoy that I just used one two three
four well I use five shades out of the
palette so I think that that's pretty
good I hope you enjoyed the mara
colorful I love but I've been really
enjoying the dubious placed palettes I
would recommend this one it's 2150 I
think that's a great price for the nine
shades and they are like bigger pan
sizes which i think is awesome so I'll
keep trying that one for sure and see
what other looks I can create with it so
liked that one the milk makeup luminous
of blur stick I'm just gonna have to try
this one out a little bit more first
impression it didn't do much for me I
don't think that I saw much actual
blurring with the skin which is what I
get with the original milk makeup blur
stick and why I go back to it so much
this one just it definitely did leave me
luminous but I still felt like I needed
some sort of like regular primer
underneath it so this might be good like
in addition to another primer maybe if
you still want luminous areas and maybe
you just want to apply this to like the
areas that you highlight but first
impression I'm not completely sold but
I'll definitely keep trying it out it's
definitely pricey at the $36 but I'll
have to give this guy a few more tries
she really did enjoy the Abeka ultimate
coverage complexion at creme I really
did like it and as I've been sitting
here I mean it's probably been at least
an hour if not more since I started
filming and I still do like the way of
that my face looks crazy to me that says
lightweight yet the full coverage and I
could tell it was full coverage even
from the one and a half pumps but it
still does feel lightweight on the skin
my skin does not feel too heavy yet I
haven't noticed any sort of like weird
areas around mines or my nose or
anything like that so I'm definitely
gonna see how it lasts throughout the
day I'll try applying this with
different primers I do want to try this
with one of my regular primers that I
enjoy and see how I like it then as well
because I don't know if I feel like it
matched the best with that milk primer
so I'll use different brushes tools
primers and things like that so I can
give a good review in my follow-up video
but so far I really did like this one I
liked the coverage that it gave I like
that it's super easy to blend out
I don't think my shade match is 100% but
I think we're close enough so so far
liking this guy they asked for my girl
mary-lou manizer I'm not I'm not sold on
this one either but I'm also not a
liquid high light type of girl but I
sell that I could show how it applies
and all of that I mean it's still pretty
and I'm just gonna have to try it out a
few different ways maybe I'll try my
finger versus a sponge what do you guys
think the best way to apply liquid
highlight is let me know I'm just
personally more of a powder type of gal
when it comes to highlight but I'll keep
giving it a shot it's 1450 if you love
liquid highlights it is very pretty and
then the pixi by petra matte last a
liquid lip and pastel petal mmm I really
love the color I'm enjoying the feel of
it so far of course I'm gonna have to
wear it throughout the day and see how
