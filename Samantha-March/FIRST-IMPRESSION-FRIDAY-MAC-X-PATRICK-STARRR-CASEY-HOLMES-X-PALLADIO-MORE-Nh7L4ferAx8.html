today's video is going to be a new first
impression Friday video I have some new
makeup here that I'm really excited to
try out so that we can do it together on
camera so I have the eyeshadow palette
from the new Mac and Patrick Starr
collection this one is in play with me I
also have a new concealer from milk
makeup that people are kind of chatting
about I have two new releases from
morphe I have one of their blush trios
and then also a new highlight that they
are releasing and then I'm so excited
for this I just got my package in the
mail with vkc homes and Palladio liquid
lipstick collaboration so I'm really
excited to test these out as well so if
you're all ready for a first impression
video let me go ahead and get started
alright I got my ears on we're zoomed in
I am gonna start off with the eyes so I
do have them primed and said I have my
foundation on and also my brows I'm
trying out a new brow pencil it's kind
of dark so I'm kind of freaked out right
now but hey that's okay um but I do want
to start off with the eyes I am gonna be
testing out a concealer so I thought I
would do that next
since I have foundation on and I'm gonna
be using darker colors I can at least
like try to help the concealer help
clean everything up if need be but like
I said I did get sent one of the
collections with the new Mac and Patrick
Starr collaboration which I'm really
excited about so they sent me at the
play with me eye shadow palette so
here's what the palette looks like and
then here are the four shades inside
they also did send me a blush palette
and the lipstick and the lip gloss but I
figure for today with the other new
items that I had I'm just gonna go ahead
and test out this eye shadow palette but
but I will be testing out the full
collab and I'll put that in a review
video and as always with my first
impression videos I will come back in a
couple of weeks and review everything I
did a first impression style last Friday
as well at the collaboration with my
friend cam so I will probably combine
these two first impression style videos
together and do one big review video in
about two weeks or so so stay tuned for
that so again this is what we're working
with and I'm kind of excited that I got
this palette versus the other collection
which that one is more purple which I
absolutely love Purple's but this blue
you are seeing this blue in like every
single palette release
of recently so I was excited to get the
blue and that's the the main color that
I want to play with so they sent along
this really beautiful picture as well
that has some information in there with
the PR kit and I want to try to like
recreate this type of look I have no
idea if I'm going to do this okay and I
was looking on Instagram for like some
other inspo as well and it seems like
that's what everyone's doing with this
palette so I'm just gonna go ahead and
try to do that myself but first I'm
going in to grab the shade right here
with a big blending brush I'll have
everything all of my brushes and stuff
linked down below like I normally do and
I'm just going to first run this into
the crease it did also receive Patrick's
first collaboration with Mac as well
which is which is I don't know if I have
good words for it it's crazy like it's
crazy to get noticed by Mac it's crazy
to be able to test out another youtubers
collaboration was such a huge brand like
so it's so exciting so when I got this
one in the mail - it always just kind of
takes me a minute to be like me you know
but I really enjoyed the eyeshadow quads
that came in that collaboration as well
in my review video I said that was I
think one's like the favorite parts of
my of the collection that I was testing
out I really really enjoyed those
eyeshadows I still do I still take them
traveling with me at cetera so I'm
really excited to try out this eyeshadow
palette so I'm gonna come in to this
pink now which I'm a little this is
where I start to get a little worried
we'll see how we do I'm gonna take my
Sigma e 54 cuz I feel like it has a good
point to it but it's also good to blend
and I'm just gonna start small start
small and build my way up but I'm also
going to run this along the crease as
well and blend it into that first color
but try to give it just more of a pop of
pink so I'm just gonna slowly keep doing
this until I build it up that way I
don't overwhelm myself like when people
are doing this look and even like impact
pitcher it's like you just see this
really bright pink kind of like popping
out from the blue I don't know we'll see
how I do I'm not the best at recreating
looks off a photo I like to watch videos
that really helps me a lot but I haven't
seen a lot of videos and I'm sure
they're out there I just haven't seen a
lot of videos yet with the collection so
I'm kind of winging it which I don't
love to do but hey go to try they're not
noticing a lot of fall out yet
we'll see what happens when we get to
the blue but I'm not noticing anything
yet again I'm just taking I'm just
taking my sweet time over here building
this pink up so once I have the paint a
place down I'm gonna go in with this
beautiful blue I'm gonna use the Sigma
II 57 and just place that onto the lid
I'm not going to use a damp brush at
first I want to see how the blue applies
on its own it looks pretty pigmented
there on the brush so I'm just gonna go
ahead and start to sweep this onto the
lid that does look pretty good without a
damp brush dang I look sure like a hood
yeah I'm gonna spray it my brush a bit
though just to make it pop just a tiny
bit more but honestly mostly also for
fallout I'm just because I do a
foundation on like I said I'm gonna come
in with concealer next but I'm getting
out some blue fallout around here so
just to try to minimize that as best as
I can if I use a damp brush it kind of
helps with the fallout so I'm just gonna
go ahead and pack that onto the lid that
looks gorgeous
so you can see I'm still getting some
fallout around my eye there okay once I
have the blue packed on I'm just gonna
grab that Sigma brush again and just
make sure everything is blended but
that's where I'm gonna leave the eyes
for right now I feel like I like this I
better than this I thought this I just
like looks sloppy I'll need to like
clean it up with concealer over here and
stuff but I feel like I like the way
that this I like blended out and how
this one looks but I also have the most
fallout over here so we get the little
paper here it looks like it will be
available coming April and 19th so I'm
gonna use this a little bit more when I
fit
off of the Ilyich but for right now sir
we're gonna leave the eyes I'm gonna
clean this up a little bit and then come
in with some concealer so for the
concealer I'm going to use this new one
here from milk makeup it's called the
Flex concealer it says full coverage
with Flex it's a vegan a full coverage
concealer it says it's comfortable easy
liquid to move with your face never
creases or cakes it's supposed to be
full coverage but also be hydrating
looks like there's eight different
shades I think this was $28 so I was
just looking at it doesn't say Oh thigh
which was weird I was just looking at it
at the Sephora website but this is what
the packaging looks like and then for
the wand here is what that one looks
like as well
I picked out the shade I don't know does
it not say on here what the heck I think
had the shade Fairs it's there okay then
so I'm just gonna go ahead and apply
this to my under eyes oh it does feel
very hydrating right off the bat I do
the one side first and blend it out and
see what I think I'm using my Ecotools
sponge it's sturdy because I used it for
my foundation as well but I could tell
right away when I applied it it did feel
hydrating like it didn't feel super dry
but also at the same time I could tell
that it felt like it had like an oomph
of coverage but we'll see how it looks
after I blend it out so here's my
under-eye with the concealer on and this
one I haven't done anything with yet I
feel like it blended out pretty easily
it does a good job covering I always
have this red mark here on my under eye
that's not completely concealed but it's
fairly concealed so I don't know I think
that it looks pretty good so far it
doesn't seem to be too drying so I'm
dealing with dry skin coz it's April 9th
and it's snowing duh why wouldn't be
snowing on April 9th so disappointed
today was supposed to be the Cubs home
opener at Wrigley I'm gonna watch it
this afternoon but nope Kat postponed
because of all the snow at Wrigley which
is crazy so I'm gonna go ahead and do
the same thing here on the next
I hope my camera was overheating while I
was blending this is side out so I did
go ahead and set it with some powder
from the cow
the shade light palette I've been
testing out the RCM a no color powder
for a review but I didn't want to do it
because I felt like I noticed that it
was a little bit dry especially on the
side and I noticed a dry patch so I
didn't want to use a loose powder
because I feel like it kind of can't
emphasize the dryness so I did notice
that and I also thought maybe the shade
fair was a little bit too light for me
so I'm going to do some spot concealing
and I grabbed out the shade light to do
a little bit of concealing around my
mouth here so that's interesting because
when I applied it it does feel really
hydrating as you're actually applying it
to the face but starting to blend it out
I noticed that it got just a little bit
thicker and a little bit more on the dry
side so I'm just gonna go ahead and dot
this around my mouth and see how it does
for a spot concealing I will also say
that I don't think the shade range is
the best especially because there I mean
I'm not I'm not a super fair so it just
makes me wonder for people who are so
much paler than me if they would have a
shade that would really work well for
him cuz like I said I do feel like this
is lighter that but it's not like super
super light so I don't know we'll go
ahead and see how this one works I feel
like that did a really good job with
everything around my mouth so I don't
know of course this is a first
impression video so I'm gonna keep
testing this out so I can give my review
but I know some people have been buzzing
about this one lately so I really wanted
to give it a try have you tried this new
one from milk makeup what do you think
but yeah so far so far so good I can't
say like I'm overly hyped about it but I
don't hate it
so it's okay I went ahead and added some
bronzer quickly as well if you like I
said added weird
how does some bronzer quickly and then
I'm gonna move on to blush so I just got
a package this morning from morphe which
I was really excited about and it came
with a bunch of blush trios blush
palettes and also highlights so I picked
out a blush trio to try out here today
this one is in a pop of fuchsia so this
is the box that it comes in and
everything was really nicely packaged it
comes with a little protective sheet
here and then
here is what the blush trios look like
and then inside of course they have
three shades in there and then there is
also a nice mirror so I was looking at
them and it seemed like there's a
shimmer in every palette some it's kind
of like this middle more traditional
blush the shade as much I noticed in
each one so sometimes it's that one and
sometimes it's the one on the end but
they have quite a few different ones to
choose from and looking at the little
sheet that they sent along it says it's
available in seven shade trios it'll be
available for $12 and it'll be for sale
starting on April 12th so that is the
blush trio so I thought I would pick
this one because I felt like the center
fuchsia shade maybe would go with kind
of like the pink in this looks so I'm
just gonna go ahead and apply to the
cheeks and see what our sink here I did
actually just mention these in my latest
will I buy a video oh okay okay too much
too much Santa right to spend some time
blending that out but I'm not mad to see
old boy okay okay then
I'm not mad to see pigment and these
though because what I was saying in my
will i buy it video is that I've tried
morphe face pellets in the past and I'm
like a straight up clown at this moment
I have tried more fees face pellets in
the past and they haven't been very
pigmented and I just didn't love them so
that's why I wasn't going to buy them
but you can see that I feel like I was I
wasn't super light handed because I was
thinking morphe Faced palettes aren't
that pigmented so but I didn't go like
super super heavy handed but you can see
that there's stuff nice and pigment to
these I do like that fuchsia color
that's pretty but I'm just gonna take
some time and blend this out maybe grab
my sponge here and do some do some work
here so hey okay
morph your blush palettes they have
pigment no lie so I tried to tame it
down to a normal blush levels the best
that I can do but I'm gonna go ahead and
swatch this palette just because I'm
curious to see these other shades in
here the blush trios were more
unique than I thought that they would be
there was just a couple photos on the
trend mood Instagram and I didn't
realize that they were like each gonna
have a shimmer in it I didn't realize
each trio like I feel like the shades
correspond to one another but I feel
like there's there's some like good
differences in here I don't know if that
makes any sense but so far I mean I'm
impressed with these I need to make sure
when I use it again I go a little bit
light hand it then I did the first time
but I'm glad to see that there was
pigment in them because I just wasn't
impressed with marque face palette in
the past but again those are swatches
and this is from the pop of fuchsia
palette so I'll be testing out a few
other ones that I decide to keep for
myself as well and I will review these
shortly
like I said morphe also is going to be
releasing a new highlights so these are
what the packaging looks like these are
going to be $14 available in six
different shades and these will be
available on April 26th so I picked out
the shade extra and again it was
packaged really nicely in here with kind
of the protective padding in there and
again very similar packaging it to the
blush trio and here is what the shade
extra looks like I'm gonna go ahead it
feels really soft
there is a swatch of extra and there it
is on my hand so it has like some
champagne gold tones to it I would say
so let me grab out my brush here and I
like that has the mirror as well and
these are $14 a piece like that mirror
in there so let's go ahead and see ooh
that looks really pretty okay so here is
what extra looks like I let that color
you know some texture over here on the
side of my face and I do see that I mean
you can see it of course because I'm
highlighting it but nothing too bad but
it is it is they're fun as I pretty pop
and highlight though that is pretty I'm
gonna take just a little bit down bridge
of my nose and also the tip of my nose
and that's about the extent that I do
for highlighting my face these days but
hey I think that's pretty good it
doesn't seem to be too powdery I think
I'm here it said something about creamy
a daringly creamy zero-gravity
highlighter for explosive a prismatic
effect
don't find it to be creamy at all like
when i swatched it it didn't seem very
creamy and even applying it but it's
nothing like too powdery or anything
like that and I feel like that's pretty
well pigmented you get a lot of product
in there you get a nice mirror so again
these will be available on April 26 okay
before I finish off with the lip color
I'm gonna go ahead and add some lashes
so I'm gonna put some lashes out and add
them I feel like with this type of I
look like I just need lashes to kind of
like balance it out otherwise with just
mascara my lashes are gonna get lost in
this blue and pink and it's not gonna be
cute okay so I summit lashes and then I
also put some of this liner from the
balm it's the mr. right in why can't I
never find shape names it's just the
blue liner I don't I don't know if it
has a shame but it's the blue so I added
that to the waterline so then I'm gonna
come back in to the Mac and patrick star
palette and just finish off the lower
lash line so i think i'm first going to
take the blue with a flat definer brush
this is a more fiji 43 and i'm going to
push that really close against the lower
lash line and then i'll come in with the
pink and then i'm going to take the
sigma pencil brush the e30 I'm gonna
grab the pink and put it right under the
blue and kind of blend it I don't know
if that will come out right but I'll
give it a shot and then I do want to
pick up this lash a shade that I haven't
used with my small pencil brush the more
PE 36 I'm just gonna put this in the
inner corner and see what she looks like
oh that's really pretty
ooh I feel like that shade just added a
little bit of kind of like a peachy
peachy vibe to the inner corner so there
is the final I look I actually like the
way the lower lash line came out well of
course keep playing with this palette
again I like this side better than this
eye I feel like my blending skills are
not being very well shown on this eye
but I like the way that this one came
out so I'm just gonna keep looking at
this I like the lower lash line I really
like how that's looking so that is it
for the eye look and then we just have
lips to finish it off so like I said I
did pick up the KC homes and Palladio
Beauty liquid lipstick collab I talked
about this in a recent role I buy a
video and just thought I was really
excited for this
Casey Holmes is one of my favorite
youtubers I do enjoy it liquid lipsticks
I'm not familiar with the brand
Palladio beauty but listening to her
talk about this and seeing the I think
it was the pop sugar review sounds like
it's a really good liquid lipstick and
I'm always up for trying new brands and
new products so I'm going to go ahead
and swatch each of these so this first
one here is in Georgia so I'm gonna
swatch them and that way well that way
you can see the swatches that way so I
can also decide what I want to do for
this eyelid these swatches are kind of
terrible but there is what the blonde
looks like there is Georgia so that one
is a really nice kind of peachy color
I'm gonna go ahead and swatch rescue
alright so there is rescue next to
Georgia and then the next one that I'm
going to swatch the third and final one
this is called obsessed that one looks
extremely pigmented woah okay so there
we have Georgia rescue and obsessed I
was kind of thinking about obsessed with
the pink lip and I'm afraid that's gonna
be like I don't know I'm good that's
gonna be like too much too much for me
right off the bat so I think I'm gonna
come in with the rescue with a nude I
feel like I'm already you know a little
outside my comfort zone with my I look
so I'll go ahead and stay in the comfort
zone with the lip product ready so here
is a rescue on my lips I really like
this nude I do like the way it looks at
the eyes too it's a really kind of like
deep brown nude I think it looks really
nice it was easy like I liked the
applicator it was easy to kind of line
my lips as well and it's very opaque it
didn't take me much to fill them in
either so let's go ahead and see okay so
no transfer there so that's good and
it's only been on my lips for it not
even a full minute so it did dried down
very fast so I will be testing these out
I'll be wearing all of the colors and
seeing how they last and all of that but
big congratulations at - Casey Holmes
again she's just one of my favorite
youtubers so I was really excited to get
this collab I love the names I love the
shades that she picked and we will see
how I enjoyed the liquid lipstick but
after that that is gonna do it for this
first impressions video okay so that's
gonna do it for today is a first
impression a Friday video I hope you
enjoyed seeing me try out some of the
new products so just a quick run-through
I really do like the palette from Mac
and Patrick Starr I want to play fit a
little bit more you know if you're not a
fan of color I don't know if you would
love this this particular eyeshadow
palette the best but I do like what I
came up with I have a feeling if I were
to reach in to this one I would kind of
create a lot of the same looks I also do
want to try to do a look with more of
these pinkies and maybe just do like a
pop of blue or maybe even leave the blue
out I don't know and just see what kind
of other looks like in creeks I have a
feeling a lot of people are going to be
doing this style of a look with this
palette but that's what I wanted to try
out today and I really did want to use
the blue but I mean Mac and Patrick
Starr I shadow palettes they have proved
to be good in the past and I think that
one will be good as well I do obviously
of course need to try everything out but
this milk makeup concealer I couldn't
get a good feel for right away it was
like kind of strange how it went on like
hydrating but then I felt like it was
drying as I was blending it out so I
have to play with it a few times and see
what I think about it but I have a
feeling it's probably gonna be that
product that I like I don't love but I'm
but I'm still like ok with it and it
still works good so I'll keep trying
that guy out of course the morphe the
morphe products okay so the blush
palette I'm glad to see that it had
pigment to it but I will keep in mind
for next time that I will go a little
bit lighter hand it so I didn't have to
spend so much time at blending it out
but that does make me excited and
hopefully they're gonna be better you
know more faced on a lot of like
rebranding and things like that in the
past few months year whatever it's fun
here so you know I like the packaging on
this I like the mirror it feels legit
and if the pigment is good that I'm
pretty excited for that the highlight I
have no complaints about again this one
was an extra again I like how much
product you get I like the mirror in
here and I feel like the highlight looks
pretty dang good I'm so excited
for Casey Holmes in the plot eco Beauty
lipsticks I'm excited to keep testing
them out if you'd want like a swatch
type video on Instagram or something let
me know where I put all three of the
lipsticks on so you can see what they
all look like but so far based on first
impressions you know it's been sitting
here and drying for about five minutes
now I would say and it still feels
really comfortable on the lips it
doesn't feel too dry for me yet there
was no transfer with them so that's good
but I'm curious to see how it wears
throughout the day
and to get those other shades on but
again that is it for today so first
impression Friday video everything that
I talked about will be linked down below
