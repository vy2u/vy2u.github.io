today's video is going to be another
first impression Friday I have 5 first
impressions here to do I have the new
nourish foundation the kathleenlights
colourpop dream street palette also the
brow pencil from colour-pop the glamour
dolls and that Lisa Frank bronzer and an
ICO mascara so I'm really excited to try
out some of these products with you so
why don't we just go ahead and get
started so I am going to start off with
my face typically I start off with my
eyes but I want to do the face today
because I have a special reasoning for
this I do want to say Ari I'm filming
with my ring light because you know
December winter Ottawa no Sun have to
either run light so sorry I don't really
like using a ring light especially when
doing tutorials because I can feel like
it kind of throws the color off and I
don't know anything about like color
correcting and editing or anything like
that so did want to point that out but I
want to start with my face because I got
this really amazing package from NARS I
mean I can't even fit hello
got this really amazing a package of
from NARS which I was so excited about
because I was planning on purchasing
this product myself I was shocked when
this showed up but they sent me this so
they picked out three foundations to
send to me and then they sent me samples
of every single one of their new
foundations and I was like what I also
sent me this really large book if you
can see so this is their natural radiant
a long wear foundation and I thought we
could do a first impression it says
introducing an artist first 16-hour fade
resistant foundation with full-powered
radiance so there are 33 different
shades 33 that is a lot so they picked
out three for me and they picked them
out for me in the light shade like they
literally broke down all of the shades
which I mean this is freaking awesome so
they picked out for me Deauville not
sure I'm saying that right which is
light with neutral balance and then also
Salzberg which is light with golden
undertones and then
Mount Blanc which is light with pink
undertones usually more of a neutral
undertone so I kind of want to try this
Deauville of course I pick the one that
I can't pronounce the name obviously so
I don't know I mean that looks to be a
pretty pretty good she'd match otherwise
one with the golden undertones was the
one that first caught my attention and
this is Salzburg maybe I'll just go
ahead and do a quick little swatch this
foundation will be $49 and it'll be
available December 14th at NARS and
nurse online and then December 26th at
Sephora so I just did some swatches here
this first one is the Deauville and then
the other one here is Salzburg so I do
think Deauville would be a better match
for me oh hey guys joining you from the
future I'm actually filming this little
segment right here to talk about the
giveaway the following day because I'm
making a little change to the giveaway
that I originally planned I'm doing so
like I was saying I think like I was
saying when NARS is sent in this package
with all of the foundation samples my
first thought was to give away every
single foundation sample and to have 33
different winners so it's just what I
said originally when I filmed this video
but I was chatting about it on my
snapchat and someone had what I feel
like is a much better idea so I'm just
gonna refill this little segment right
here to chat about the giveaway and then
we'll jump back in to the regular video
what I'm going to do a for this giveaway
is I am going to group the Foundation's
by shades so I believe I'm gonna have
six different winners I'm just gonna do
the first like 5 foundations here in one
group the next 5 foundations in another
group and so on and so forth though you
don't have to worry about getting your
exact shade of foundation because I know
that that could be pretty hard to match
and my worry was I would send out 33
different packages and only a few would
actually work for the winners so this
way you'll at least have a couple
different ones to try or if you mix
foundations or maybe a couple of shades
do actually work for you and you go
through one and you can try another you
can give them away to your friends if
you want I just thought that it would be
a better plan and I also thought it
would probably run smoother than me
having to pick 33 winners
contact 33 winners wait for all the
information package everything and ship
out
three packages I feel like this is just
gonna go somewhere they're all the way
around so I wanted to pop in real quick
to say that that is how the giveaway is
going to go when I do go ahead and put
together all of the different pairings I
will have that list in the description
box down below it'll just say Group one
and then I will list the foundation
shades Group two I have a list of
foundation shades so when you enter the
giveaway I would just have you put in
the number corresponding it to the group
of foundation shades that you want to
win and then I will pick one winner from
each of those groups the giveaway will
run I'm pretty standard to how I do my
giveaways normally there will be a link
to a generator in the description box it
down below you just want to enter it
that way it'll ask for you know some of
your information your name your email
there will also be a spot to put that
number for what foundation group you
want to win the only thing that you must
be doing is being a YouTube subscribers
and make sure you are subscribed to my
channel and there will be some other
bonus entries in there as well I think
I'm gonna have the giveaway open for
about two weeks to let a whole bunch of
people enter and I'm really excited
about this one it will be international
as always and like I said I believe
there's going to be six different
winners and you will win a bunch of the
little foundation samples the foundation
samples are all point one three ounces
which i think is a great size I get
foundation samples quite a bit myself
from Sephora and I find that they last
me a good amount of time and you can
actually try it multiple times versus
like a sample card where you can really
only try it once so you can actually get
a good idea of will this foundation be
worth the $49 for me to go out to
purchase and then hopefully from the you
know the different foundation shades
that you try will be able to find your
exact match so I didn't want to pop on
here and just make it a little bit of a
correction to the giveaway but I think
this will make the giveaway runs so much
smoother and I think there's a better
chance for the winners to actually
finding their correct shade and being
able to use their foundation samples so
I hope that you guys are excited for the
giveaway because I really really am I
just thought this was so cool and
immediately once I saw this huge package
I knew I would have to give back in some
way so that is what I'm going to be
doing for the NARS a foundation that
giveaway so make sure to check the
description box I see what foundation
shade group that you want to enter for
and then click the generator so you can
get entered good luck to everyone and
let's get back to the video it does say
to shake well on the bottle so I'm going
to do that
I have not shaken it and on it also says
natural radiant a long wear foundation
has the cap has the pump I'm just going
to do a couple pumps here onto my Sigma
f80 and I did apply some primer before
happening on here so my face is already
primed so I'm just gonna go ahead and
dot it and then start to blend it out so
this is one where I can tell right away
that is full coverage like it was
covering everything it is giving me that
second skin so we will see how I like it
full coverage isn't always my favorite
I've been game I've been I've been doing
better though I've been doing better
with them I've been finding a few that I
actually really do enjoy so we'll see
what I think of this one sometimes I
just feel like full coverage like sits
on me funny but we'll see here okay so I
feel like the shade match is pretty good
maybe a little light I tried to do like
half my face so we can see but so far I
feel like it blended out really easily
sometimes with full coverage I feel like
it's kind of like thick or like hard to
blend out this one I didn't find any
issues with that it was almost a little
bit more liquidy like I definitely
understand why it's said to shake well
so I'm most a little bit more liquidy
but it made it pretty easy to blend out
I don't hate the the color match at the
moment so that's good but sometimes it's
hard to tell - with just the foundation
on I kind of like putting everything
else together so I can see how it all
comes out notice it yet settling into
anything like sometimes around my mouth
full coverage foundation is kind of like
settle and weird we're like on my
forehead - but I don't see anything to
that sort yet so far I just feel like
it's sitting really nice on my face so
that's good I'm trying to like closely
look at myself in the mirror but
definitely very full coverage if you do
like full coverage I noticed that right
away and I did use a brush sometimes if
you use a damp Beauty Blender it can
kind of help shear out full coverage a
little bit but I did use a brush which
is usually how you get like the most
film so of course this is a first
impression I'll need to try it with
other primers and other tools and tests
along where and you know all that good
stuff but I just got this package
and I thought it could be a fun first
impression to do so so far so good on
the foundation I don't feel like I'm
overly like oh my gosh I like skin looks
amazing so far but I will keep keep
checking on it throughout the day and
see how it wears and settles and all of
that so I didn't have a new concealer so
I just went ahead and did a concealer
and send it and then I'm gonna keep
moving along with my face before I start
in on the eyes I got this in my most
recent
epsy bag this is from glamour dolls in
collaboration with Lisa Frank and it is
the bitten and bronzed matte bronzer
I've been wanting to use this and
wanting to use this and I thought it
could make for a fun first impression I
just mentioned it in my I did a bronzer
and blush decluttr just a couple of days
ago and I mentioned in there and there
were so many comments on this bronzer
that I thought let's put it in the first
impression video so I think the
packaging is just super super cute like
I said I did get mine in the hip seed
bag and I actually went to look the
bronzer up as I'm filming it and it sold
out on the glamour dolls website I
really hope it comes back the I think
the I shadow was sold out too I think
there was still a brush available but
this is only $4.99 which I don't think
is a bad price I mean looks like you get
a bunch of bronzer too so I'm really
excited to try it and I sincerely hope
it comes back in stock because I think a
lot of people are really liking this I
saw Kathleen like to use it the other
day and she seemed to really like it too
so I'm gonna go ahead and use this to
put on sup my face here and I'm gonna
use my Sigma it's a large powder brush
the f30 but I really like to use it for
bronzing so I'm gonna try to start off
with a light hand here and see how it is
so so far I've had the foundation on now
for like maybe 10 minutes or so and like
I said I put concealer on and all of
that and to me it almost looks like it's
just a little bit on the cakey side
which is another reason why I don't go
for full coverage a lot because I feel
like that happens so I just used my
Smashbox primer water I'm not gonna lie
I feel a little lazy today I just use my
Smashbox primer water so the next time I
use the foundation I'm gonna use like a
really like hydrating primer and see if
I can kind of counteract that and we'll
see how it goes which I should have done
that anyways because I know that when
something says it's more full coverage I
typically like to use something that's
more hydrating so I will try that and I
also want to try applying it with a
Beauty Blender and see which one I like
more but as always when I do first
impression videos I will come back in a
few weeks to do a follow-up I did do a
first impression last ride it as well so
I think I'm actually going to in about
another two to three weeks here I'm
going to do a follow-up video including
last week's first impression and this
week's first impression so I can review
them all at once so that is what my plan
is for now so the bronzer seems to be
going on really nicely like I said I was
trying to do it in a little bits because
sometimes if a bronzer is too pigmented
and you're like it's a really really
hard to blend out but building it up it
looks to be like a really nice bronzer
again sometime I don't like filming with
a ring light too because I feel like my
reaction can be skewed when having such
a bright light facing me but so far I
think it's looking pretty well you know
it's like one of those things where you
do your makeup in like hotel lighting
and you're like looking good and then
you walk out and you see yourself in a
regular mirror and you're like what
happened sometimes that's how I feel
when I have the ring quite fun but so
far it seems to be looking pretty good
feel like a pretty warm bronzer but it's
not anything like I don't feel like it's
super overwhelming me or anything like
that so that's good it doesn't want to
be too dark on me either so I'm just
gonna go ahead and put some on my
forehead I'm so dry right now like we
have had horrible winds which I think
maybe the wind is contributing to my
dryness but I think some like crazy
crazy winds in Iowa and then just like
with it becoming colder my skin
typically gets really dry so I'm trying
to bust out all my like hydrating sheet
masks and my mouth like hydrating
sleeping creams and all of that to kind
of combat it but I am dealing with some
dry patches right now so that is what
the bronzer looks like I think it's
really pretty I'm happy with it I think
the packaging is cute I feel like you
get a lot of product in here too I
really really hope it comes back
especially for the $4.99 like I don't
feel like that's a bad price at all so I
like it it doesn't appear to be like
patchy or straight here anything it
blended out really well and I do like
the color so I'm excited that I finally
was able to use this guy who else got
the Lisa Frank bronze
in your FC bag or did you could just
pick it up regardless and what do you
think about it but so far I think it
looks pretty good ready so that is it
for the bronzer before I move over to
the eyeshadow palette I am going to do
my brows real quick and I do have a new
brow pencil this one is from colour-pop
I shared it in my book Friday haul this
is their precision brow pencil so this
is what it looks like and I shared it in
my haul and I have just gotten it like
an hour before I started filming and I
realized that you can't like I started
to twist it up so I could show people
what it looks like which this is what it
looks like I got mine in the shade dope
taupe and I was like oh you can't twist
it down and I was like tell me if I'm
wrong cuz you know I just got it I'm
filming like I'm kind of rushed and
people are like no you can't twist it
down so we're to the wise with the
precision brow pencil from colour-pop
you can't twist it down because I always
twist my pencils up really far and then
use them and twist it back down and put
them away not with this guy won't so
let's just we're just gonna go ahead and
see how this brow pencil works out
alrighty so the pencil was a $5 and
again I got mine in the shade dope taupe
and it does have a little spooley on it
I did try out a brow pencil in last
week's first impression tune it was from
Maybelline so it was another affordable
one and update like I'm still loving it
still loving it so I'm excited to see
how this one will compare okay so first
few strokes in like I use really light
strokes when I first start and it
appears to be really really pigmented so
I'm just gonna try to keep using a light
hand I really need to like groom my
eyebrows are kind of out of control but
bear with me real life wow that is wow
it is really pigmented like I'm barely
having to press down that's crazy the
shade match looks to be pretty good so
far - like it's almost making me a
little nervous how pigmented it is I'm
afraid I'm not like mess up and it's
gonna be really noticeable okay so I'm
just gonna use light strokes and fill in
the front here and I'm just gonna try to
make some hair like strokes along the
front of the brow and then once I have
it all filled and I'm going to just pull
through everything again then I took me
like no time very very pigmented like
wow really nice but it almost is like
too much like I I felt like I was
holding my breath the whole time like I
was gonna screw up I don't know I'll
have to see if I can get the hang of it
it's just kind of making me a little bit
nervous but there's what one bro looks
like doesn't have a reddish tint to it
that just could be the ring light again
but this is the shade dope dope again I
mean it worked really well here's the
comparison but with my brows I felt like
it worked really well and it was really
fast it was faster than I expected I'm
gonna go ahead and start work on the
other brow here it just says I don't
know if I've ever had a brow pencil that
it's like quite this has so much of an
OOP like as you are drying it is just it
is there man it's not playing around
okay there is the second brow on as well
I mean first impression I'd have to say
that I'm very impressed I did not have
to press hard like that's one thing I
really don't like in a brow pencils but
I really have to like press and like I
truly pull my eyebrows out trying to
press so hard I have to press very
lightly with this one and it shows up a
right away again it could just be a
thing where I'm a little bit nervous of
how pigmented it is because I don't want
my mistakes to show super easily but I
think if I just use a super super light
hand it will show up okay but other than
that I like the color match to it was
very easy to apply it's not too waxy
either I like a little bit of wax enos
with eyebrow pencils but not something
too waxy because again I feel like that
it's kind of what makes it really hard
to apply as well so so far first
impressions especially for only five
dollars like this is not bad at all I'm
kind of curious to see which one I'm
gonna end up liking more at this one are
the Maybelline since they're both
affordable brow products but I mean so
far so good I think it worked out really
well so hey that's pretty awesome
I'm gonna move over to the I should
appellate work on the eyes and a lot of
people have been excited to see this
this is the kathleenlights and color pop
a dream Street palette this is their new
collaboration the new eyeshadow palette
that they came out with I saw it I saw
that Kathleen's video on saw the
swatches and I was just like yeah I'm
gonna get that at $16 which I didn't
think was a bad price that
and I just think the colors were really
speaking to me I thought there are some
really fun colors in here so I makes so
excited I do have some swatches on my
Instagram and I also asked I just posted
a couple hours before I gotta film this
video and I said what colors do you want
to see me use in my first impressions
video and the majority of people said
the teals in here of course I felt like
that was coming but a lot of people also
said they wanted to see the teal and the
silver together so that's what I'm gonna
try to do I don't know if you guys can
hear the wind but it is so loud it's
creaking everything it's kind of spooky
but when I saw teals and Silver's keep
getting requested I was like okay I'm
gonna try to do a halo I I'm not always
the best of Halo wise but that's what
I'm gonna try to do so basically we're
going to take I think it's water-bearer
this two one right here and also is it
kaleidoscope I can't tell for sure which
way you know sometimes it's like
confusing like how are they actually
named but I think it's Water Bearer and
kaleidoscope I think don't hold me do
that but I do have my eyelids primed and
then I also set them because there
wasn't kind of like that matte white
shade in here so I'm first going to come
in to that matte teal and I'm going to
use this is a morphe g18 it's just kind
of like a bigger pencil brush and i like
to use these types of brushes for doing
halo eyes and so I'm first just going to
start on the outer corner and just pack
it onto the outer corner and I tried to
dip in lightly and really tap my brush
off because I could tell from doing this
swatch that it was a crazy pigment it
and yeah it really is crazy pigmented so
hopefully this the cyclic turns out okay
uh not the best don't have the best
techniques of life ever but we'll go
over to try so I'm just gonna work on
packing that shade just on the outer
part of the eye I'm just gonna do a
little bit more here because usually you
have to come back and intensify it
anyways someone doing a halo eye I don't
make sure like the inner or the outer is
absolutely perfect until I have the
center shade placed down as well
normally I wouldn't do like especially
when working with darker shadows I
wouldn't do my foundation at first but
I'm so excited about the NARS foundation
and I want to talk about the giveaway so
that's why I wanted to do it first but
yeah especially with working with dark
colors typically I do the eyes first in
case of any fallout which I see just a
little bit so far nothing too crazy so
hopefully it's okay but then for the
halo eye I'm also going to work on
putting that right in the inner part of
my eye as well leaving the center bare
for that silver shade right so once
we're looking crazy I'm gonna come in
with this silver shimmer I'm going to
use the Sigma II 56 lip brush I love
this for shimmers glitters anything like
that and I like that it's really small
so I like to use this one for the halo
eyes I'm first gonna come in with no
setting spray just like I normally would
when trying out a new palette but
typically I come in with a damp brush
cuz I just prefer that but I'm gonna try
first just like I do with everything
else
woah that's actually really nice with no
setting spray wow wow so I'm just going
to tap that shade on the center part of
the lid I'm really surprised I honestly
feel like I don't need to get my brush
wet that like never happens wow I'm
really really surprised here this silver
is beautiful and especially combined
with the teal I feel like it's causing
it to have like a super cool kind of
green reflect or maybe I'll actually
hold on looking at it let me swatch it
really quick so this is what that swatch
looks like almost looks like it has just
a little bit like when I tilt my hand
back and forth it almost looks like it
has a little bit of like a green
reflection in there like a really light
green reflection which is really pretty
but really like that reflect and I think
especially with the teal eye it's just
it's just making it so pretty but yeah
I'm not I'm not even gonna dampen my
brush for this because I am liking it so
much so once I have the silver place I'm
going to come back with the original
brush I didn't add any more product to
it I'm just gonna kind of run it over
those areas with the
you'll kind of play around hello eyes
can kind of take me just a little bit
add emphasis to the darker parts I'll
come in like I'm gonna grab my brush
again I'm gonna add a little bit more
silver as well so it's just uh you want
to take your time and wait till your
friend they get the finished effect that
you're going for I'm gonna grab another
small brush this is the Sigma e45 it's
like a again look kind of like a bigger
pencil brush but completely clean and
I'm just gonna kind of blend the crease
so it doesn't look too harsh and then
now I'm going to come in I add it just a
little bit more of the teal and I'm just
gonna darken these spots just a little
bit coming again with the clean brush
and then kind of blend everything
together this is how I do my halo eyes
so this is a watch the first I looks
like it takes me a little bit to do halo
eyes so it's easier for me to complete
one fully instead of kind of going back
and forth like I normally would but I am
very impressed I mean I am very
impressed I only use two shades first
impression all of that but Wow I'm very
impressed I almost never not dampen my
brush with shimmers and you just do not
need it at least with that shimmer shade
so this makes me excited to use the
other ones like you know I'm totally
feeling these up here I'm definitely
gonna try those next but wow very
impressed so I'm gonna pop off camera
and do the second eye so this video
isn't over an hour long because that's
probably where we're at right now but
yeah then we'll come back and work on
the lower lashline and I'll dip in this
palette once again so I'm going in to
finish off with the eyes here so I'm
going to come in and first take the
matte tool that we use I'm going to use
the g28 it's just a flat definer brush
from morphe and I'm just going to push
that really close to the lower lash line
I did add just a little bit of brown
eyeliner to my waterline I have to say I
was really worried about the fallout
since I did my foundation first I had
basically none on my face so that is
amazing sometimes you get done and you
just got like leftover shadow everywhere
and you know sometimes I can wipe it
away with the brush but sometimes I need
actually go in with a makeup wipe and
remove it but I had to
nothing like I went like this and that
was it like I didn't even use a brush I
didn't use a makeup boy I feel like
nothing so I am super super impressed so
far grabbing another brush here I think
I'm gonna come in and do I think I'm
gonna do the first color here and I
think this one maybe is called shooting
star and I'm gonna use the morphe M 506
and I'm just going to sweep that onto
the lower lash line and kind of blend
out of the blue as well and then I want
to take some of this gold here I think
this one is called sweet dreams or spark
I seriously I'm just I always get so
confused please don't hate me but I'm
going to use my morphe 36 and I'm just
gonna put some of that into the inner
corner and I thought I'm gonna do four
eyes I've been kind of skipping brow
bone highlights as of recently just a
couple months cause like obsessed with
them and doing them every single day and
now I'm kind of like laying off probably
cuz I need to groom my eyebrow so it's
really probably the reason like I don't
need to emphasize that but while I'm
really really impressed again I've only
used a couple shades I will be using
this palette like crazy I'll do a
tutorial over on my Instagram as well so
let me know what other shade selections
that you would want to see me use but
I'm just impressed everything was very
pigmented I still kind of can't believe
I didn't have to use a setting spray
with the shimmer everything went on
super nicely there's really no fallout
on my face I'm very excited to keep
trying more from this and for only $16
like kathleenlights you did good cuz I
know she's watching right right lastly
I'm just gonna finish up with a mascara
I actually just got a package in from
eiko I've never received an adequate
package so this was really cool and I
was glancing through it and I saw this
mascara and I was like wait a second I'm
intrigued this is called the lash alert
mascara it says it has caffeine says it
give your lashes a lift for instant
volume curl and definition that lasts
all day wake up your eyes with our
energizing fiber enhanced formula
infused with caffeine and then other
really good things to stimulate lash
growth so I just got super curious about
this one I was actually planning on
doing lashes but then when I saw this
mascara I just got intrigued enough that
I was like
I kind of want to try this out so oh my
gosh the tube is super interesting this
is what it looks like I'm not very
familiar with ICO I've tried out one of
their eyeliners but that's really it I
looked it up on the Ulta website I think
it's like $26 for a mascara so a little
bit expensive but energize your lashes
okay hey I don't know let's just go
ahead and see I'm pretty particular with
my mascaras so I never really know if
they're a good thing to do a first
impression with but I will go ahead and
give it a try okay so the wand is like
it's like skinny but it has a little bit
of a bent to it so let's just go ahead
and see the packaging is super cute
though so I'm curious to see how this
goes so I'm just gonna start with the
lower lashes
I like the brush it's really easy cuz
it's like skinnier it's really easy to
get right at the base of the lash and
kind of wiggle the lashes around it
looks to be separating them very well
also and doing a good job of lengthening
them I'm actually pretty darn impressed
just trying this out and may my lash is
really really long it separated them
well off so it doesn't really do a whole
lot for volume but for length I'm like
really impressed that appears to be a
little bit on the wet side so I know
some people kind of don't like water
formulas and some people don't like dry
formulas together so this one I think is
on the wet side I have the mascara on
both lashes I did notice just a little
bit of like I see like two little black
spots underneath each eye so I think
that has to do with it being wet I think
I would need to do one eye and let it
dry for a good amount of time before I
start like blinking like crazy and
working on the other eye but actually
I'm pretty impressed and it takes me
it's not easy to impress me with a
mascara but I just feel like it made
them look really long which I really
appreciate that so so far so good we'll
see how it lasts throughout the day and
if I get any more like fall out around
my face and things like that but you
know I'll be back in a couple weeks to
do a follow-up video but so far so good
I'm actually much happier with this then
I thought I just keep staring at my
lashes like wow they actually look they
actually look really nice and the brush
is really easy to work with - I liked
how skinny it was I could really get
right up in there and extend my lashes
so
that's pretty cool again they sent me a
few other products too so i'll be trying
out some more ICO products for reviews
here lately but this is the lash alert
mascara they wake up and go mascara I'm
excited to see how it lasts throughout
the day but big THANK YOU to Aiko I just
was too curious I wanted to test it out
so I am pretty happy with that as well
and that's it for the first impressions
so I'm just gonna add like highlights
and a lip color and then I will come
back to finish up the video ok so this
is my finished look today for my 5 first
impression Friday's I was that you guys
enjoyed this video or found it helpful I
have to say I am really really impressed
with both colour-pop products I tried
I'm really loving the kathleenlights
palette just based off my first
impression I'm really excited to keep
using it and the brow pencil really
excited me too it was super easy to work
with and for only $5 that's pretty
freaking awesome so I'm excited to keep
trying it out I also was really
impressed with the ico mascara which
surprised me I'm excited to try it a
couple more times and see how it lasts
and how my lashes hold up throughout the
day and to see some of the claims to
about the the caffeine and you know core
in the lashes and all of that the Frank
bronzer I thought was really pretty the
NARS foundation I'm definitely going to
need to give a couple more tries to and
try it out a few different ways I
noticed that it's a little bit cakey on
my skin and again I think it's because
I'm going through some some dryness
right now so I need to try it with a
couple different primers and tools and
see how I end up enjoying it if I end up
enjoying it it's kind a couple weeks
here I'll be doing my follow-up video so
I can give reviews on all of these
products that I have been at testing out
