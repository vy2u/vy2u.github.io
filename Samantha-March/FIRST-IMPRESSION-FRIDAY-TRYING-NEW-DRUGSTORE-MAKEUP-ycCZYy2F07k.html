today's video is going to be a first
impressions of Friday I have five
different drugstore affordable products
here to try out with you I have some
Maybelline sleek makeup and then also
elf cosmetics so five first impressions
on this Friday so I'm excited to get
some makeup on this face
so why don't we go ahead and jump into
it the weather is just refusing to
cooperate this week I think every single
day I've had to film with my ring light
which I really don't like filming with
ring light I'm not smart enough to
understand my camera settings and how to
change them what I have to fill them
with a ring light so I don't know so
sorry if the lighting is off I am gonna
start off with my face normally I would
do the eyes but I think I'm gonna do
something pretty simple and my skin is
pretty mad at me so I think I'll just
feel better if I start off with my face
but I'm also really excited because I
did get a new foundation I talked about
this in a recent will I buy a video I
talked about some new releases at from
Maybelline and I said I had picked up a
few so this is the foundation I'm gonna
use this is the Maybelline 24 hour
foundation what's it actually called
there we go super stay full coverage
foundation so this is what it looks like
I got mine from Ulta and it was 1199 I
got mine in the shade 130 buff beige and
actually it does have a pump which i
think is rom-com for drugstore
foundations the shape that I want it was
sold out I can't think what it was
called now but I compared my better skin
foundation from Maybelline and I picked
out that same shade but it was sold out
it was the only shade that was sold out
at the time I was like obviously I
understand I believe this used to be a
Maybelline foundation and then they've
kind of like redone revamped it is what
I'm understanding from watching other
YouTube videos I did not try the
original what is it why did they not
have the name on it there's the name is
on the cap like the superstay is on the
cab like I don't know think that needs
to be on the actual foundation bottle up
and drive me crazy but I'm excited to
give it a try Bonanno foundation kick
lately I love trying new foundations I
did put a little bit of a smoothing
primer on to my face going to dump this
on to my skin I'm using my Sigma 3d HD
max kabuki brush it's going to go ahead
and blend this out so far it looks
pretty good for the shade
match maybe actually a little bit on the
darker side for me which is funny
because this was actually a shade
lighter and the original one I was gonna
pick out so maybe that's a good thing so
I can tell right away even with just
using like the it was about two and a
half pumps that it is a full coverage
foundation I kind of wondered because
sometimes things stay full coverage and
its really like you actually have to
build up to full coverage you have to
use a few extra pumps but I can already
tell that are very full coverage like
it's immediately just like covering it's
giving me a second skin I'm not a huge
huge fan of full coverage but every once
in a while I find a foundation like the
Urban Decay all nighter I actually
really do like and I thought for sure
I'd hate that Foundation and the Laura
Mercier the what's up for the long wear
foundation that she has I actually
really liked those which surprised me
but yeah I can tell let's do a full
coverage play on my skin I have to say
that I'm actually pretty impressed that
just those few pumps gave me full
coverage and you know I was able to
cover my entire face with just those
pumps and it even did a pretty good job
covering I have I told myself that I
could party like a rock star over the
weekend if you follow me on snapchat you
know I mean that in a literal sense and
I got made a new friend for staying up
until 4:00 a.m. so hello it covered it
pretty darn well though so that's I mean
that's pretty awesome to me that really
it took most of the redness away I can
just kind of see that there's a raised
bump right there but that's definitely a
full coverage foundation so full
coverage for $11.99 if you are a full
coverage girl that covered a lot
it looks like it's sitting really nicely
on my skin - sometimes with full
coverage I can notice it kind of doing
weird things with the lines maybe I can
tell a little bit right here by my mouth
that it kind of settling into those
lines but nothing too crazy yet but of
course I did just put it on so I'll have
to see of course this is a first
impressions video so I'll come back and
do either some sort of like follow-up
review video or just some type of review
video regardless and about two to three
weeks because I like to give products a
pretty fair chance to try a bunch of
times like with foundations time with
different primers brushes sponges
different tools you know and all of that
but so far so good
I'm kind of surprised I didn't know if I
would like this but it caught my
intrigue enough and for $11.99 I was
like I'll try a new Maybelline
foundation and so far we're looking
pretty good
the next thing I'm actually gonna do is
my brows I have a new Maybelline brow
pencil too but I'm gonna go ahead and
pop off camera and do like concealer and
bronzer and blush and then we'll come
back to do eyebrows and then start on
the ice it is so crazy I just keep
looking at my face like I can't believe
how full coverage that was like a little
bit goes a very long ways with that
foundation and it was a touch too dark
so I used a layer concealer I use the
Maybelline but our skin so probably look
a little crazy right now without having
everything else filled in but I was just
trying to make it all work out in the
end so I'm gonna move over to my brows I
did get a new brow pencil this one is
also from Maybelline the total
temptation brow definer this is what the
package looks like this was $7.99 from
Ulta and I was a little bit bummed
because they only have four different
shades of this and I was between blonde
and soft brown but none of my eye
pencils my eyebrow pencils say anything
about being brown so I was like I don't
know I think Brown even soft Brown I
think that's gonna be too dark for me
but I was like it's blonde gonna be too
light for me so I wish there would have
been a shade like in between there but
we'll see we'll see if we can make it
work so this is what the brow pencil
looks like so you have this kind of like
I don't know if I've ever seen a spoolie
like this on one end it's very very
short and kind of different looking and
then we have the brow pencil on the
other Bowl that looks dark for being
blonde but we'll see it has the teardrop
shape here and it looks a really really
thin I think it reminds me of the goof
proof but the goof proof is like thicker
and this is really thin you guys know
I'm not not the best with brows I don't
have a big old bra game or anything but
I'm gonna give them my best shot so I am
going to take the spoolie end first and
I just kind of push up the brows at the
front and then I kind of split out where
I want to the shape of my brows to be
I'm just gonna take the pencil and start
to fill in a soft line underneath first
and then kind of drag it through my
brows creating the shape of the brow and
then coming out here to create the tail
and then I just kind of do soft strokes
to fill in and then I'm just gonna make
some hair like strokes the best I can at
the front here and I have it pretty
filled and I will just go through and
kind of spoolie everything out the shade
match actually doesn't look too bad
it looks it looks pretty darn close so
that's that's good and it was pretty
easy to fill in I actually I don't mind
the spoolie being so small can kind of
get right up in there oh I'm just
looking at myself on camera for the
first time hopefully I wasn't framed
during all of that I have no idea if I
was or not they it looks pretty light on
camera maybe it's because I have my ring
light on to that it's kind of like
showing a different effect but as I'm
looking at it in my mirror I feel like
it looks like a pretty good match do you
think the soft round probably would have
been too dark if this is what blonde is
I was just worried that blonde was gonna
be like really really blond um but no
this one is looking pretty good so I'm
gonna go ahead and do the same thing
with the other brow so I just kind of
slide the front up and then shape it
foundering for me to do any sort of like
tutorial types of videos because I'm
just holding my mirror here I don't have
a table in front of me I'm sitting on a
bar stool um I don't have a table I
don't have like a nice mirror set up I
don't have anything so it's like huh
it's kind of hard I don't have a camera
man telling me when I'm in frame or
blurry or whatever so I'm like oh man
these can be tough to make but I know
people like to see them so I still try
to do either once a week or once every
other week you know trying new makeup or
I get ready with me type of video our
first impressions or you know something
along those lines but they're definitely
not my favorite and I always get accused
like literally every single video of
using a filter and it makes me feel dumb
when people say that because I'm too
dumb to figure out my camera settings
and it just makes me feel Dumber when
people say I have a filter because I'm
like I don't I wouldn't even know how to
put on a filter I just don't know how to
do any of that and I don't know if it's
in the camera settings I don't know if
it's an editing
I don't know I don't know how people do
it but I don't know how to do it so when
people accuse me of that I just want to
scream at them and be like I'm too dumb
to know how to do that so like please
stop making me feel even dumber because
I just don't know
and I've tried looking at my camera
settings I've tried asking for help over
and over in facebook groups on YouTube
on snapchat I have asked over and over
and over for help and all I really ever
get back is that it doesn't look like I
have a filter I'm like well then why do
I get comments every day saying I do and
it's another reason I don't like doing
these type of videos because people are
like I can't actually see you and I'm
like I don't know I can see myself on
camera I've watched it on my TV trying
to tell like I don't know I can see my
pores I can see my texture I can see my
redness I can see breakouts so I don't
know if I had a filter wouldn't I be
filtering that like what what isn't that
what a filter supposed to be for so I
don't know maybe I have even what a
filter supposed to do wrong because I
can't figure that part out either but I
don't know I have the sony a 5100 if
anyone wants to offer me any advice like
I just went through the other weekend
and spent two hours trying to figure out
settings and I changed a few things
around and I swear it did absolutely
nothing like I I don't see any
difference at all so I'm like well that
was a huge waste of time but if anybody
notices or you think you notice any
difference let me know because that was
two hours of my life that I wasted on
camera settings so bummer and I've said
this before in a video but I've had this
camera for almost two years now and I
never once got accused of having a
filter until one costed a video saying
all beauty influencers use filters it's
the only time I have started getting
comments about having filters and I used
that camera for I don't know eight ten
months before he did that video never
once got a comment so no something to
think about
okay so there are my brows using the
brow definer from Maybelline I feel like
that worked pretty well again I'm not
like a brow professional and like
sometimes they can take me a little bit
longer to do them but I felt like that
was pretty easy to use again like
similar dish to the benefit goof
proof but not really because I felt like
this is even smaller and more defined
than the goof proof so I actually
thought it was pretty good I didn't mind
this bully at first I was like mmm not
sure I'm gonna get along with that but
really I mean you don't need a huge long
spoolie for your brows so I feel like
that worked out really well and the
color matches pretty good too I think I
would I think I'm happy with blonde I
think saffron would have been a little
bit too much but yeah for $7.99 I'm not
mad at that I felt like that did a
pretty good job so I'm excited to be
testing out a new brow product I'm
trying to expand my brow products
currently and try new ones so that's why
I wanted to go for the broad binder but
I don't know you can let me know what
you think about my brows how do I do so
I'm going to work on the eyes next I got
this a sent to me in PR from sleek
makeup this is an eye shadow palette in
when the sun goes down so this is what
the palette looks like and this is
available at Ulta Beauty I see it on
there for $12.99 so you have a mixture
of matte and shimmers you also do have a
mirror and then there was a brush in
here with kind of like the sponge to the
applicators but it fell out and
disappeared so I'll have to find that
later before it responds it but I don't
typically use those I just grabbed out
some of my regular brushes in here so
this palette I haven't even swatch it or
anything yet so I think I'm gonna go
through and do just a few swatches so I
can get an idea of what we are working
with so let's see here I have never
tried I don't think I've tried anything
from sleep makeup actually okay here are
the first four swatches this one looks
really pretty I don't think I've tried
anything from a sleek makeup so this is
going to be a first for me
so there are some swatches there okay I
just decided to swatch them all out so
those are the first four and then I did
some more swatches on my arm back here
so they are actually I mean they look to
be pretty pretty decent I see some
shades that are calling my attention
like even some of these lighter shades
like this light pink right here I mean
that does not look at that at all not a
very like funky palette there's not
really any like super crazy bright pops
but I feel like I really like this
shimmer like maybe I want to try to do
something with that guy
that there's a mare in here - that's
nice and so I'm first gonna take this
shade right here they don't have shade
names and them but it's just like a
light pink shade and I'm just going to
run this all over the eyes first wow
that looks pretty well oh okay I'm just
using my Sigma e25 to do this and now
I'm gonna come into the second shade
there looks like a nice transition Brown
maybe a little bit on the darker side
but we'll see how we do I'm gonna use my
Sigma e-40 and blend that into the
crease so I feel like this one is pretty
decently pigmented I was worried it
would be a little bit too dark for a
transition shade but I'm just kind of
using a light hand and the Sigma e-40 is
really fluffy brush just kind of helped
making it not be too overpowering right
away so I feel like everything else is
pretty shimmery like some of the mats
are the like lighter pinky shades so I'm
just going to I'm just I'm just gonna do
my best I'm gonna grab this last shade
here in the front row and again my Sigma
e25 and I'm just going to kind of tap
that on the outer part of the eye and
mostly just keep it focused on this
outer corner that's trying up really
well - that looks nice
I'm not always the best at coming up
with like looks and color creations and
I know people ask me a lot about it too
and honestly I watched so many YouTube
videos and tutorials like I know people
are saying that like YouTube tutorials
are over with and I really hope that's
not true because I watched so many -
just trying to learn and see what colors
people are doing and just to get
inspiration that's really where my ideas
come from so far I'm really liking what
we have going on so now I'm gonna come
in with a shimmer so I'm going in to
grab the third shade right here in the
top row I just really liked how that
shimmer looked so I'm gonna use my Sigma
F sub needs a concealer brush but I
really like using it for shimmers too so
I'm just going to first not dampen my
brush usually I will spread my brush
with like a setting spray just to make
colors pop more make a more metallic
make them last longer
but when I'm trying out
make up I always like to try first just
to see because I know not everybody will
use a setting spray that's showing up
pretty well for my preference I am going
to spray my brush but I mean honestly I
did a get ready with me was it last week
I think it was maybe last Friday and I
used a shade light kind of similar to
this from a Charlotte Tilbury palette I
used it even with this setting spray and
I mean it was a pretty weak shimmer and
that's what $75 eyeshadow palette I mean
that's not bad but let me spare my brush
and see what we get I'm not noticing a
lot of fallout on my face either so
that's that's pretty awesome what is the
$13 palette like okay okay like this
look is kind of giving me like New
Year's Eve vibes and like I said I mean
I take a lot of and spill from tutorials
and Babs Beauty did one the other day
and she did kind of like a cool toned
look kind of like with a similar shimmer
to this and if that look has stuck in my
head the whole time I'm like I want to
do something like that so when I open up
the palette and I did the swatches and I
saw that shimmer shade like she's the
one that popped in my head immediately I
was like yes
that's what I got to do like I don't
know that's how I get my in spell that's
how I picked my colors and stuff a lot
based on other youtubers and the
tutorials they do I am NOT an
artistically creative person I can't
just look at a palette and put things
together so I really rely on those
tutorials oh people are saying that
people just have doing them and I'm like
please don't stop because I won't know
how to do my makeup I completely in
self-taught with makeup from YouTube
like 100% so I'm just gonna take my
Sigma e25 again and just make sure these
are all blended together I really like
these shadows I'm excited I'm excited to
play more with this palette there's some
really fun shimmers in here alrighty so
so far so good with the palette I'm just
going it to add some liner and mascara
off camera and let my camera kind of
cool down and such because it's about to
overheat but so far first impression Y
is so good for sleek makeup it's oh I
Brown liner to my waterline and then
also put on some mascara so I'm just
gonna finish off the lower lash line I
think I'm just gonna go ahead and mix
the first Brown that I put on and then
also the second shade I put on too and
I'm going to use my Sigma e30 which is
just a pencil brush I'm just going to
sweep those on the lower lash line even
that like look at how Wow okay okay so
like pick up we went to quite the smoky
eye I just I don't know I mean I feel
like I am totally was judging a book by
the cover when I opened it up and it was
like okay maybe but hello do not judge a
book by the cover girlfriend you are an
author you know that that is a rule and
I'm just gonna take my same F 70 brush
and then the same shimmer shade that we
used and I'm gonna apply just a little
bit here into the inner corner as well
to kind of open up the I love to but I
just feel like this I look is similar to
what I did last week with the Charlotte
Tilbury but if you watch that video I
couldn't really give the Charlotte
Tilbury palette glowing remarks I like
the mattes in there but overall
especially for the $75 price tag I was
like I'm just you know I can't say that
it's worth that price it's just $13 and
I feel like I just made a pretty
comparable I look to that and I'm
impressed I don't I'm not really sure
what else I'm supposed to say right now
I know this is first impressions so make
sure to remember that but I mean I don't
really know how you fight with this type
of first impression impressed so now the
eyes are complete I'm going to finish
off with a highlight and then a lip
color those are both going to be from
elf cosmetics and these were both sent
to me as well I did purchase the
Maybelline items if I didn't say that I
purchase them from Ulta so this
highlight from elf is called their
highlighting holographic duo and they
sent me a couple different shades and I
picked out the shade mermaid tail
it says achieve a radiant finish with
dual chrome colors and this holographic
duo perfect for wearing alone or
layering these are eight dollars on the
elf website get it out here okay so this
is what the packaging looks like and
then when you open it up it does have a
mirror and then here is what that
highlight looks like I have so much
these I did a
hold on my Instagram stories and i
swatched it and the swatches were just
okay to me I remember so we will see
what they look like on the face I do
look there's a mirror of these that's
pretty handy I'm going to use my
favorite Highland brush my Sigma fo3 I
got a new one nice and nude fancy so
this side has a little blue in it so
maybe I'll do this first and then I'll
put the blue on top mom we'll try that
we'll try that see what we get I feel
like I've been being more adventurous
with my highlights lately kind of doing
oh okay I definitely have some pink
reflect in it it's pretty I mean it's
like subtle ish so I don't know how well
it's gonna show up on camera but yeah
it's definitely uh more pinky than I
thought let me do the same on the other
side but yeah I feel like I've been more
adventurous with my highlights lately
and trying like erat doesn't in
different colors I don't know if it's
showing up hmm I mean I can see it but
it's pretty faint let me try the blue
side and see what we get okay I felt
like that really that stepped it up and
it kind of made it like those two
together kind of made it like a purple
okay that's different that's different
and interesting yeah I felt like I felt
like the blue really helped bring it
together and the white on the other side
was kind of not really doing much but
that is super interesting to me that
I've made my highlight purple whoa
that's crazy so eight dollars if you're
really into the iridescent highlights
you can get a duo for eight dollars
basically two different colors win them
on their own mix and match okay that's
very interesting elf cosmetics they have
I think three different shades of these
as well again this one was in mermaid
tail I mean that is definitely how I
would describe this I light it really
does look like a mermaid tail but okay
so that is the new holographic highlight
duo from elf cosmetics and lastly we
decide to finish off with a lip color
I'm really excited to try these because
Christmas is all first impressions but
I've been really eyeing these these are
the elf a liquid lipsticks they're
called yeah the liquid matte lipsticks
they are five dollars they have quite a
few shades in there
I got mine in praline so I'm excited to
test these out I really like liquid
lipsticks and if we can find a good one
for $5 you might know that the went well
didn't work out for me which is like
devastating but let's go ahead and check
out these elf ones so immediately the
applicator is kind of reminding me a bit
of the smashbox
always on liquid lipsticks it's kind of
like flat but pointed at the top okay
okay let's see here I'm just gonna dip
back in once more so do two coats on the
bottom so far so good
here is the shade a praline from elf
cosmetics on me so I did you know I
dipped in it twice or the bottom and top
which that's no big deal to me because I
do that with a lot of liquid lipsticks I
really like the applicator I liked how
it had that pointed tip I'm not someone
who uses the lip liner a ton so it's
really nice to be able to have that
pointed tip to really round out and line
my lips so I thought that was really
nice it dried super super fast and it
did dry completely matte the only thing
that you know maybe could be a con is
that I feel like it really settled into
all the lines in my lips but I am also
dealing with a really really dry lips
right now when the one when the weather
changed to super cold my really my
everything is super dry I am dealing
with really really dry lips so this
might just be something like maybe do a
lip balm underneath it kind of might
help that's really the only con that I
noticed but even right now I've had it
on for about ten minutes or so as I play
my camera cool down again joeys of sony
a 5100 and it doesn't feel really like
try are really tight on my lips I
haven't noticed anything like that so
far so good on the liquid lipstick of
course I'll wear it throughout the day
and a couple other times too and like I
said everything that I used in here was
first impressions so I will have to try
them out several more times before I
come back and I will do an update video
in the next couple weeks here but after
the lipstick this is the final look for
my first impressions Friday okay so that
is everything for today's video I really
