channel thank you so much for watching
today I'm really excited for today's
video because it's going to be my very
first first impressions video so I'm
going to be doing this all on the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion
foundation I just picked this up from
the drugstore not too long ago and i
asked you guys if you would want to see
a first impression video me applying it
my thoughts of it and it was like an
overwhelming yes so i've had it for like
two weeks and I haven't used it at all
because I wanted the first time to be on
camera so that is exactly what i will be
doing in today's video I do apply this
with both my Beauty Blender on one side
of my face and then my foundation brush
on the other side of my face to see if I
thought maybe there was any big
differences between how to use it and
kind of give you my feedback on that if
you guys would like to see a first
impression of the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi cushion foundation please keep
watching you one side of my face with my
foundation brush and the other side with
my Real Techniques makeup sponge just to
see which one I like better hearing a
lot of people like to use the sponge
over the brush but I want to see which
one I would prefer so my shade is n 3.5
hopefully you can see that I know you're
like super all up in my face right now
but let's just stay here so when you
open it this is what it looks like it
does come with this little like puff
which I'm not going to use not not going
to lie to you from your here but I don't
want to blind you and then you like pop
open this and then your foundation is in
there oh one has a mirror so that's nice
ok so I'm going to use my real
techniques sponge first and maybe i'll
use the side with like the slope on it
so you just I just pressed it like
pretty lightly into there and I feel
like it kind of got a lot out so just in
the go ahead and bounce it on here
so I had no idea if this shade was going
to work out for me because I told the
story i think when i was doing my
drugstore haul but um when i went to my
CBS looking for it I couldn't find it in
the regular makeup section and I found
it in like a different part of the store
and the woman was like just setting it
out from the box and everything and like
she didn't even know if it was on sale
she didn't know the price of it but I
got it and so I felt like I was kind of
rushed cuz she was literally like
staring at me waiting for me to purchase
so she could keep doing her job and so I
kind of like grabbed it in a rush and I
was pretty sure jaclyn hill said she was
the end 3.5 and I was like close enough
I don't know what to do so but I think
it looks pretty pretty good right are
you guys think that's a pretty good
match I like how it went on with the
Beauty Blender like it seemed to be
pretty that was a pretty easy
application I mean I only did half of my
face I did have some redness right here
and it seemed to cover them up pretty
well like i would say probably as well
as my other foundations have i do
usually come in with like a concealer
just to make sure i get them but i think
it that did that did a pretty good job I
have a primer on I have the two-phase
primed and poreless primer on my face I
didn't want to use the other primers I
have are all like luminous primers and I
didn't want to use a luminous primer and
then a luminous foundation because I
thought that would be like two luminous
ok so I'm going to do the other side of
my face with my morphe m 439 foundation
brush it's like my favorite foundation
brush ever so I'm just going to tap it
in there get some product
so I feel like I probably picked up more
product by using the brush
like with the Beauty Blender I think I
dipped it like twice and with the brush
I definitely feel like I picked up more
product so I don't think I need to go
back in at all i don't know if i see a
huge like if I feel a huge difference
between using the Beauty Blender and the
brush honestly it feels really nice on
the skin though like it doesn't feel
heavy at all like right now it really
doesn't even feel like I'm wearing
anything you know sometimes when you put
foundation on and you can just like tell
you a foundation on like I don't feel
like I feel like that right now that's
pretty cool okay so just looking in the
mirror looking at both sides of my face
like I don't feel like either one side
looks really different from the brush to
the Beauty Blender I don't know what I
would say I prefer i think i picked up
more product with the brush but i don't
know maybe it looks a little bit more
dewy on the Beautyblender side and that
might have something to do with you know
being a white beauty blunder it kind of
gives like a little more hydration to
the skin maybe I don't know um I don't
know if I have a real big preference on
what i would do maybe it would just be
like what i'm feeling that day but i
think either way would work really well
but I just this feels really nice on my
skin it feels like I'm not wearing a
foundation which is so nice pretty good
job of covering everything like i said i
have those little red marks but usually
not every foundation cover said i
usually go into concealer anyways it
does a look I feel like it looks pretty
luminous I think a little bit more on
the side with the Beauty Blender but I
do think it makes my skin look healthy I
think it actually did a pretty good job
on the color match which really excites
me especially because of the
ice but yeah I really like it so I'm
going to finish off my makeup and then
or I my concealer I'm actually going to
do like another first impression and
this is for the maybelline superstay
better skin concealer i also picked this
up in the same drugstore haul and i
haven't used it yet so i'm going to go
ahead and try that here is well the doe
foot applicator and shade i picked up
was in light so i'm just going to put
this under my eyes so right off the bat
i notice that it's not as creamy as the
maybelline fitme concealer like the
maybelline fit me is just so so creamy
and like just easy to swipe on under
your under eyes so that's what i noticed
right away it definitely has a thicker
consistency I think then the maybelline
fit me as well i think the shade will
work pretty good blend that out i'm
going to use the more fiji to brush it's
just our pointed buffer brush I love
this for under the eyes so I'm going to
use that to buff it out so even though
the maybelline fit me like i said was
very creamy this is still very very easy
to blend out like this is super easy to
blend out so I like that it has a little
bit of a thicker consistency because
sometimes especially like in the real
inner corners of my eyes like I can
really struggle with my dark circles
there and I think actually like just
from what I can see my little mirror
like it maybe looks like it helps a
little bit more for coverage on those so
I like that like I said it was very easy
to blend yeah that seems pretty nice
seems pretty good set that like I
normally would with the Rimmel stay
matte powder and i will give you guys an
update as well in the
box of what I thought like creasing wise
and how it lasted throughout the day
we can go
ok
we'll get
hey
hey
free
okay great
we
okay we're
sugar
take you guys through a little like
quick version of who I do with the rest
of my face makeup so hopefully you guys
enjoyed that part but I've been sitting
here for probably about 40 minutes just
like letting it sink into my skin I keep
looking myself in the mirror I'm taking
a few pictures just to see what I think
of the foundation and right now like my
very first first impression of it is
that I really really like this and I'm
really happy because the price of this
is 1699 which is very expensive for a
drugstore foundation now and also
another thing is that with this
foundation you only get point 5 ounces
with this and then like if you compare
it with the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
foundation the one that comes in the
pump bottle it's a full fluid ounce and
this is like half the price of this so
I'm kind of like what do we do I don't
mmm I don't know if I really understand
so I'm very excited that I love it i'm
not going to lie the packaging i think
is super cute i love this like rose gold
look I'm sorry I can tell them like
flashing you guys at certain times but I
like the rose gold look it was very easy
to use and apply I am hearing that you
want to make sure you shut this part
like pretty tight so it doesn't dry up
but it's easy to open that and it's so
nice that you know the products right
there it's not going to fall out it's
not going to go anywhere you don't have
to dump it out onto your hands to use
the foundation I really liked it I
thought it was very interesting very
unique this is the first time I'm ever
trying a cushion foundation and so far
so good I thought but what just really
impresses me is that it truly does not
feel like I'm wearing foundation but the
coverage is pretty good like I would say
it's like probably like a solid medium
coverage on me maybe even medium to full
coverage but it's so lightweight that I
don't feel it on my skin it doesn't feel
cakey it doesn't look cakey I did set it
with my fit me powder and I kind of
made it whether or not to set it but I
always set my foundation and I debated
on whether to use a primer as well but I
always use a primer so I'm like do what
you would normally do because that's the
best way to judge it so i used the
two-faced primed and poreless phone or
primer as well and then put this on but
I feel like it makes my skin look very
healthy as well it does give a nice dewy
glow to it but it's not super luminous
to where I look kind of like oily and I
think it's because of the primer that I
used like if i were to you is my backup
backlight primer or even my maybelline
blur and illuminate i think there would
be like too much doing this happening on
the skin which i don't think i would
like but because i combined it with not
even a matte primer but just something
that is not having a dewy effect paired
that with a luminous foundation and the
result to me it looks really well i'm
really happy i seem to get my shade
correct it almost does look a little bit
more like it's more yellow toned so just
something to think about they're
definitely does seem to be a yellow
undertone in this one but i really am so
happy with it so I'm filming this in the
afternoon I'm going to wear this
foundation the rest of the day the rest
of tonight and be sure to check the
description box because I will give more
of a review down there I'll let you guys
know how it lasted during the day all
that good stuff also I did use the
Maybelline better skin concealer for the
very first time in this video as well
and so I will also have like my final
opinion down there after wearing it for
a day letting you guys know how I
thought it went if it creased all that
good stuff so be sure to check the
description box because I'll have a
little bit more insight in there for you
as well um but I'm definitely going to
be wearing this a lot I can imagine i
feel like this could very well be like
one of my new favorite foundations just
because i love the way it feels on my
skin i love how light it feels on my
skin and i love that it really makes my
skin like it looks like my skin but
better and like healthier and i'm all
about that especially
in the winter i love that it gives me a
little bit of a dewy look a little bit
of a luminous look but not anything too
overwhelming it doesn't have me feeling
like cake face it doesn't look like cake
face I'm really really excited for this
thankfully I'm very happy that for the
very expensive non drugstore price that
I seem to have fallen in love at first
application process this but those are
my first impression thoughts on L'Oreal
True Match Lumi cushion foundation I
