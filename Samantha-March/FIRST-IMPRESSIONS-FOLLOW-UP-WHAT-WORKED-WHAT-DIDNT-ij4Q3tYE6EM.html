today's video is going to be a follow-up
video from a video I did about two weeks
ago I want to say it was it was a full
face first impressions video I will have
it linked down below and up in the cars
as well if you have not seen that video
do enjoy doing first impression types of
videos I think they're fun to watch i
watch a lot of them myself I think they
are fun to do but I am also a review
lover I love watching reviews and I also
love giving reviews I wanted to come
back on camera and give all of my
thoughts on everything that I used in
that video I've continually been trying
them out the past couple of weeks here
and I have some feedback on each of them
so if you would like to see a my
follow-up to my full face first
impressions video when we go ahead and
get started I'm just gonna go in the
order of how I put things on my face in
that video and the first thing I did I
started with my eyes and I used the pure
My Little Pony palette so this is what
the palette looks like it was a
collaboration with in My Little Pony
movie I mentioned this palette in a
while I buy a video and I was on the
fence about it I had said I wasn't going
to buy it because I didn't need any
eyeshadow palettes but I was excited for
it because a pier came out with the
trolls tell it last year I absolutely
loved it I thought it was fantastic and
it looks really similar to this like
packaging and layout wise and all of
that and I believe they are both $29 so
I was super excited I was like if it's
anything like the trolls palette it's
gonna be so good it is not like the
trolls pellet you guys I'm super super
bummed about that you could kind of tell
in that video I was having some
struggles when I was using it for the
first time I wasn't really loving how it
came out in the end everything kind of
came together but it was a bit of a
struggle to get there I have tried it a
couple times as well I do have it on my
eyes today I have a little bit of
generosity in the crease I also put a
tempest shadow into the crease as well I
have storm King on my lids and then I
have Fluttershy in my inner corner
legitimately I think Fluttershy this
kind of like pink iridescent I think
that's my favorite shade of the out of
the entire palette and I really just
love it for the inner corner like I
don't even really like it on the lids I
like it for inner corner a lot of these
shades I'm finding are not very
pigmented with the trolls palette you
just had to dip your brush in there and
boom like you were getting payoff like
crazy with this I have
really have to swirl around I have to
dig my brush in so the shimmers I do
want to use a you know some sort of
liquid to be able to get the full moon
of the shimmer shades the max didn't
blend the best it's not the worst
palette that I've ever used it's not the
worst pigmentation I've ever used but I
think I was expecting the trolls palette
I know I was expecting the trolls
palette and I didn't get it so I was
definitely disappointed and it's
definitely a bit harder to work with one
day I did kind of like my go-to I'm in a
hurry
type of look where I just put one brown
eyeshadow all over my eyes and then I do
a pop of color on the lower lash line
and I was like perfect I'm gonna use
this purple right here that's called
magic it was like you couldn't even see
it it was like you couldn't even no
matter how much purple I was putting on
every time I would start to sweep it on
the lower lash line it was just like
poof magic it was gone that was a really
big bummer um I also tried the same with
this really pretty green shimmer and it
just didn't show up very well I did like
this mention I thought that was really
pretty at the red I do think it's nice
as well I'm sorry it's not a Fluttershy
that I think is my favorite it's this
one right here is Twilight Sparkle
that's the one that I have on my inner
corner and the one that I love the
Fluttershy I mean you can see that those
two are pretty similar Fluttershy just
has a little bit more pink to it but
other than that I kind of struggled as
well color wise with this palette I kind
of struggled to put different looks
together all in all it was okay it's not
the worst palette but it wasn't
something I got super hyped about like
when I did reach for this palette
knowing that I was gonna do this review
video I was kind of like what am I gonna
do today how long is it gonna take me to
blend out these shadows like what am I
gonna do with these shimmers that you
know are so hard to pick up and put on
the eyes again there's a few colors in
here that I think are really pretty bit
bit of a Miss for me so I was bummed
about that except I moved over to my
face the primer that I used was from
Urban Decay this is their urban defense
complexion of primer it does have SPF 30
in it this is $34 I actually kind of
like this I'm not a big primer person
like a lot of times I just like to use a
spray primer because I just find them
really quick and easy the only thing I
kind of don't like about it is it
has more of a what am I trying to say
like a silicone type of feel and it
makes my fingers like really like
slippery and slimy and I don't like that
feeling but the actual primer on my face
I do like it I do like that it also has
the SPF 30 and I think that's really
good I know our summer days are kind of
doing billing down but I'm still
spending a lot of time outdoors so I
really enjoy when you also can have your
makeup be a part of your SPF because of
course we always want to be protecting
our skin so I did like that it felt
really nice on the face very lightweight
$34 is pretty darn expensive for a
primer though so I mean I don't think
you have to like run out and go get this
one but if you're a huge fan of primers
and that you want to try them all or if
you really love Urban Decay I'd like to
try out their products I did think this
one was pretty good I won't say it's my
favorite primer but I have been enjoying
it for my foundation I used the Givenchy
photo perfection fluid foundation with a
sunscreen this was sent to me via
actally so I was super grateful to be
able to get the chance to review a
chiffon she foundation and when I looked
it up it is $51 which honestly kind of
shocked me I really expected it to be
more in like the 60 to 70 dollar range
but it was $51 you get point eight fluid
ounces of product typically with
foundations you get the 1 ounce boat
this one you get point 8 it is very very
liquidy so you do want to make sure to
shake it well but I also found with this
one maybe because it's so liquidy that
you need a very little amount of product
and it does go a long way I actually
really like this foundation I have it on
again today I've used it several times
because I haven't wanted to try to
review it but I just enjoy reaching for
it there's been a couple frogs in here
like that pure trolls palette that when
I'm reaching for it for a review I'm
like God use that again but this one I
actually really do like I will say when
I apply it with a Beauty Blender which
you know you you apply your makeup with
a damp Beauty Blender it's more of a
medium coverage to meet but if I apply
it with a foundation brush I can
definitely tell it's more of a full
coverage so kind of depending on how you
prefer to put your foundation on or if
you have a preference between medium and
full I also did try building it up you
know putting it on with a Beauty Blender
and then applying another layer and it
built up just fine for me into the full
coverage I really like the finish it
gives like it gives a healthy I think it
says
- is that what it says on here I think
I'm maybe I read it on this before
website but it's supposed to give a
luminous finish and I would really agree
to that it's not a mattifying foundation
at all but it's not like overly dewy or
like by the end of the day sometimes
when I use a really glowy foundation by
the end of the day I can kind of look
too dewy I don't have oily skin I have
normal skin a buns if I use a really
glowy foundation I'll kind of want to
powder my face at the end of the day I
didn't notice that with this it just
gives a really nice healthy glow my
shade is in six which is perfect honey
and I think that one worked out really
well for me but I ended up really liking
this foundation if you enjoy high-end
foundations or testing about high-end
foundations I would maybe give the G
Vaughn she want to try because it's been
working really well for me before my
concealer I was super bummed about this
I recently posted my least favorite
products from my favorite brands video
I'll have that one linked down below
and this was actually my choice from
morphe brushes it was the concealer I
just grabbed out of random shade they
sent me a couple different ones but
their concealer did not work out for me
at all and in my full face first
impressions video I even kind of
mentioned how I know I've seen the
reviews a lot of people really dislike
this concealer from morphe but I was
like nope I'm keeping an open mind you
know I don't care if everybody else
hates something I have to be able to
give it a try for myself and you saw in
the video that I kind of panicked
because it dries incredibly fast on the
skin this is definitely a concealer
where you have to apply it to one area
of your face but lend it out and then
apply to another area of her face
unfortunately it also dries very cakey
it's really hard to blend out it just
didn't look good my under eyes look so
Creasy no matter what type of setting
powder I was using with it I tried
baking with it and I'm not a big baker
in makeup and just in general it just
was not working out for me at all I was
so super disappointed because I actually
really enjoy concealers I wear
concealers every single day it's like
that one thing I really really have to
where we was super bummed that I didn't
enjoy the morphe brushes concealer I
think it is only $4.99 so if you wanted
to give it a shot it is pretty
inexpensive but unfortunately I would
not be able to recommend this move on
I'm gonna talk next about this pixi by
petra or pixie beauty their quick fix
powder entrace
listen so it is just a translucent
setting powder like this and when you
open it up it is interesting because you
have your powder here and then it
actually comes with like a little buffer
to to kind of like buff the powder into
the skin I did like that there is this
little mirror on top of it I thought
that was a cute touch I actually like
the way it looks when I use it to a set
my Tiger Eyes I really do like the way
it looks at stuff very very flawless I
detest it with flashback I wasn't giving
any any flashback with it so that was
good and I just I like the finish that I
gave I only use this on my under eyes I
don't use it to set the rest on my face
because I just don't really do that in
general the only thing that I think is a
bummer about this guy is that it's 20
bucks and I think that's pretty
expensive you are getting three grams of
product but you know I know that pixie
is drugstore but you know kind of on the
pricier side but 20 bucks man like I
feel like that's expensive so I would
say if you can get it on sale or they
even like use your target red card or
something I do think it is a pretty good
setting powder so in the video I believe
I use bronzer and contour from this
morphe 9c palette this was a palette
that actually really excited me more he
did send this to me now I was super
pumped about it because I actually had
always wanted to purchase it myself
I love contour I love bronzing I was
like yes this is going to be right up my
alley and I'm I didn't love it as much
as I thought I was going to I feel like
I can't find like my perfect shade in
here for some reason I don't know I've
been messing with all these darker
shades this one is a pretty good bronzer
on me but I felt like I couldn't find a
good contour shade for me and still I
have to build this one up quite a bit
for it to be the right bronzer shade on
me maybe in the wintertime it'll be a
little bit better but uh I don't know
it's just it's just okay for me it's
2299 so for that price I wouldn't really
be able to recommend it unless of course
your skin tone is different from mine
which there's a really good ring up side
of this and you think that these types
of shades would work for you but it just
didn't really do anything for me in
general not even just like shade
matching but I think I even mentioned it
in the video towards the end I was like
it was fine but I have my other bronzer
and contour powders that I like a lot
better so it was just just okay for me
it did use a new brush in that video for
is either
or bronzer this is from the modem italic
line this is their buffer brush it's
$8.99 to buy as a single on the website
they do us will have a couple different
sets I love this brush I'm totally
digging it I keep reaching for it I
think it's bomb I love I love the shape
of it here it kind of reminds me of like
my morphe what was it called the m5 3-0
but it's like better I've been using
this I've already washed the brush and
it looked I mean it looks exactly the
same from before I washed it so super
super happy with this so definitely
wanted to give a shout out to the Mota
buffer brush I've been diggin it next if
I have the Kevyn Aucoin at the making
faces beauty book I believe I've just
used this one for blush in that video
comes in a little booklet like this and
then inside you have three so it opens
up has a mirror and then you have these
three different books that just magnetic
and they pop out chapter one is contour
chapter 2 as blush and define what I use
in that video and then chapter 3 is
emphasize eyes it's a full little eye
shadow palette I am really digging this
you guys it's $75 which I know is a high
price tag but if you look at everything
that you are getting so for example here
is the contour book so we have the
sculpting powder which I use today and
it is absolutely freakin beautiful then
you have a highlight and then you also
have a bronzer I love all of these all
three this book is bomb right there and
then at chapter 2 is blush and define so
here is what that one looks like the
blushes are a little bit too deep for me
and my skin tone but they were really
pretty I used blush of d'Or in the video
you need like the lightest hand because
it is super super pigmented and then
like I said for chapter 3 this is an
entire little mini eyeshadow palette
right here like look how awesome that is
so you get all three of these for $75 so
if you think that you would use each of
these guys then I don't think that price
tag would be bad it just depends on your
preference if you think that you would
use them a lot I have been so impressed
with so many things from Kevin of Kwan
the sculpting powder though is
definitely my favorite like I said I do
have it on today and I think it's
absolutely gorgeous you love Kevin
naquan or you like high-end makeup or
you like you know the three little books
that I showed you in here
I really do think the $75 would be worth
it I continually reach for this guy
before my highlight I used the Makah
fashion fanatic palette as part of some
new palettes that Mac just released I
believe they released a 6 and different
palettes they did send this one to me
this one is in fashion fanatic so here's
an up close the eyeshadows so these are
all eyes shadows over here and then you
do have a highlight the highlight was
just okay for me it's definitely more of
like a peachy or highlight it just
didn't give me enough BAM like I like my
highlights to be like I liked it for you
to see them like I don't want to just
look kind of glowy like I want you to
know I have a highlight on I fell off
the highlight train for a while but boy
am i back on it I mean I kind of thought
the same with the eyeshadows I featured
this palette actually in a makeup
monthly in the ok section I had just
tried the eye shadow so far I thought
they were pretty decent if you love
these colors if you love the shade range
if you loved Mac eye shadows then add
the pellets are 3950 and I think they're
decent there's nothing that really like
blew me away or anything like that but I
still thought it was fine if I want you
know I said all highlights someday then
I can reach for this palette but for me
it was just alright so next up I had my
brow product this was called stroke a
brow the feathering pen at firm
ardella Beauty this is from a new line
our del Beauty is coming out with more
products brow products and mascaras and
some eye pencils in there and new
lipsticks and all this fun stuff I got a
really cool package from ardell I was
very curious about this because this is
what it looks like I was very
intimidated by this because I'm not
super great at brows and I have my
comfort zone brow pencils are like are
my thing they're what I know how to do I
feel most comfortable doing them but I
try to get outside of my comfort zone
and I tried this guy and it it was a
struggle I struggled a lot so I I have
only reached for this a couple more
times and it was both on nights where I
was actually just sitting here not doing
anything at all and I knew that I could
wipe it off but I wanted to give it at
least a couple more tries so I could
give you know an honest review and not
just try something once and and say it
doesn't work I mean if maybe you you
know how to do brows really well
doesn't matter what brow product you are
using you you can just master the brow
maybe this would work for you but I
think if you're a brow beginner or if
you really only know how to use pencils
this is really hard to work with and of
like this felt tip it's kind of flimsy I
I just felt like I never had really good
precise control from it so it was pretty
challenging to work with so I really
don't see myself reaching for this
anymore now that I am doing this review
III think we're done now if items I just
didn't really work out for me and I was
super bummed about it was thrive
Cosmetics this was the eyeliner that I
tried it's their infinity waterproof
eyeliner in Nalia unfortunately this
just really wasn't very pigmented it
wasn't creamy at all it was really rough
on my waterline and wasn't showing up
and was just basically kind of
scratching my eye if I just kind of
smudged it on the lower lash line it was
fine but I like my eyeliners to go in my
waterline and then I use shadows to
smudge on my lower lash line and I think
this was kind of expensive yeah it was
$22 so I would not be able to recommend
a $22 eyeliner that really isn't very
pigmented but the mascara that I used
was a new one from Urban Decay this is
their troublemaker mascara it had a lot
of different claims on it including
being sex proof I cannot I cannot tell
you about that claim because that would
maybe turn this into a different type of
video and I'm not I'm not really down
with that but the Urban Decay
troublemaker at mascara I kind of feel
the same way that I did actually in the
first impressions video I thought it was
decent
I truly am NOT a big mascara person
because I wear false lashes the majority
of the time but it is nice to have those
really good mascaras in there for your
non-policy days when you still want to
look like you have lashes because I have
such tiny thin lashes that I need a good
mascara to help him out I wouldn't say
that this would be my favorite mascara
by any means but I also don't think it
was like the worst mascara I've ever
tried it definitely made my lashes
longer I didn't think it did much for
the volume for my lashes but I could
definitely notice a lot of length with
them so I thought this point was just
okay let's take a that I used hasn't
released that story behind it this was
from a nude Stix this was there it's
actually a lip and cheek bone and it was
in the shade Haven it looks like this
these are $24 and
I did this to it I apparently when I was
putting it too back in the cap one day I
was actually just like basically somehow
like smudging it onto the cap I don't
know what I did but I broke it China can
get a little bit more color out of it I
was super sad because it was a really
beautiful color it was a really nice
nude I'm gonna say it's like my new
favorite formula or anything like that
and these are $24 I think that's
interesting that you can also use them
on your cheek but again it just it
wasn't like an instant favorite and even
after trying it out for a couple times
it just hasn't turned into a favorite of
mine I thought it was just pretty decent
but I was excited to try out nude sticks
I think maybe if they were a couple
dollars cheaper they would be even
better but I never did put them to test
on my cheeks because I'm just not really
into anything kind of like cream or gel
like that going onto my cheeks but it
was pretty good pretty good and then the
final thing that I tried in the video
was the Urban Decay makeup setting spray
the cooling and hydrating chilled makeup
setting spray I do really like this I
definitely enjoy my setting sprays I
have a whole drawer full of them I've
always trying out new ones and I have
been reaching for this quite a bit I
really do enjoy them I know that every
decay setting sprays have always gotten
a ton of height but I mentioned in the
video I now feel like I'm a cool
youtuber because I finally have some
I've been reaching for it a lot I think
it works really well this one um that I
use is the cooling and hydrating we've
had some pretty warm days here in Iowa
so I keep reaching for it on those
warmer days to kind of cool me down I
think it does a good job doing it
sometimes setting sprays are kind of
hard to like gauge and tell if they're
really prolonging your makeup is that
your primer that's doing is your
foundation your sankar I don't know if I
did really like this one and I will
continually be reaching for it even now
after my review time is over alright
guys so that is everything that I used

mini reviews on each of the products
