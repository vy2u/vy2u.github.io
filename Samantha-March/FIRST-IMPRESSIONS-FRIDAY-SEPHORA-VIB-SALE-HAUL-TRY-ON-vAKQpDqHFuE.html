video is going to be a first impressions
Friday video I asked when I posted my
support vib sale hall earlier this week
if you would like to see it first
impression style video try on a type of
video with some of the items that I
purchased during the sale and a lot of
you said yes so that is what we are
going to be doing today if you haven't
seen my whole video I will go ahead and
leave it linked down below but don't
further ado let's get some makeup on
this space okay so I am going to be
starting with eyes like I normally do uh
so I did get the Tarte tartlet toasted
eyeshadow palette which I am so excited
about so here is what she looks like I'm
really about to present sure what look
we're gonna go with but I'm first gonna
dip in into the shade warmth here with
my Sigma e-40 and I'm going to place
this one into the crease wow that's no
joke okay okay
I felt like I just very lightly talked
to my brush in there but that was quite
pigmented that's a really pretty color
so I'm just going to sweep that all
along into the crease and then slowly
working into the inner part of my eye as
well the warm has more orange in it than
I think I was expecting so I think what
I'm going to do next is go into a latte
here in the bottom row I'm just gonna
use the same 8:40 and basically just do
the exact same thing that I did with
warmth just run latte on to the outer V
and then slowly across the crease and
into the inner part of my eye when I do
first impression videos and even when
I'm testing a palette myself for the
first time like not on camera I
typically do my pretty basic look
because this is like what I do most of
the time I don't always do like crazy
makeup looks or you know makeup looks
that really take a lot of time those are
more for special occasions so I like to
go with you know my norm so that's what
we're doing today is trying to decide
from the shimmers which one I want to
use on my eyes so I'm just going to go
ahead and swatch bin so here are some
swatches so this one is a sunset this
one is flame this one is simmer
and then this one is crackle all of them
felt the same except for crackle crackle
felt like very soft I guess I would say
so there are the swatches so now I just
got to figure out - which one I want to
put on my eyes I think I'm gonna go with
the third shade here so that one is
simmer that one is the in the last row
right here you use my Sigma e55 shader
brush and I'm not going to use any
setting spray or anything at first no
damper brush I just want to see how it
applies and right off the bat so I can
say that I feel like it looks good like
I mean it's showing up and I can see it
in all but I already know that I would
want it to be a little bit more a little
bit more of an so I'm gonna grab out I
setting spray and just dampen my brush
and see how we do I just got my brush a
bit damp with some setting spray and I
feel like I like that a lot more that
looks really pretty so once I packed on
the gold I'm going to come in with the
shade cozy here and a sigma e25 I'm just
gonna grab a bit of that and kind of tap
it on the outer V to bring back some
dimension over here so I'm just gonna
kind of lightly tap here on the outer V
and then once I have most of the product
deposit it down then I will go ahead and
start to buff it inwards but so far I
don't really have too much fallout on my
face I see just a little bit over here
so far I'm pretty happy with the
pigmentation of everything I don't have
any real complaints yet so I'm just
going to keep building up when you're
working with darker colors it's better
to build up then just put a bunch of
darker colors on your eye and have
problems blending it out so like the way
that this is looking right now still
lots of fall vibes I'm just gonna add a
small wing I'm gonna use the Kat Von D
tattoo liner I'm not gonna do anything
crazy today because I do really like
these shadows but I would like to do
just a small wing so I'm gonna go ahead
and do that off-camera and I will come
back in a little keep working I am gonna
break from the eyes for just a bit after
I have my little wing on I'm gonna move
to the face so I do have my face primed
and then I did pick up a foundation in
the sale this is a from do your it's
there forever skin foundation do your
skin forever foundation okay there we go
I picked mine up in the shade oh three
oh and I don't know it might be a little
bit too good for me
since my tan has faded but we will just
go ahead and see so this was $50 so I
wanted to get with the 20% off I'm just
gonna use my Sigma f80 it does have a
pump so I'm just going to pump a bit on
to my brush I did post a photo of this
on my Instagram and a lot of people
commented saying like this was their
favorite foundation and how much they
loved it and you know obviously the
reason I had it on my love list for the
sale was because I see so many people
using it and recommending it oh that's
nice even have it all the way blend it
out yeah but I'm like oh no matter right
now not bad not mine I shave match at
all either it does just say like tad bit
too dark but I actually self tan quite a
bit in a winter so it should probably be
fine as long as I'm self tan oh I am
really enjoying the way this is making
my skin look I mean from I did like the
first of three swipes and I was like
wait a second it was like it just kind
of settled in so nicely onto my skin I'm
really liking it I would say it's medium
coverage I don't think it's really full
coverage and that was only you know I
just did a few pumps maybe you could
build it up to full coverage but I
prefer medium and I feel like this is
really solid medium it's covered up
basically everything on my skin it's
that time of the month so I have some
breakouts on my chin and it covered
those up really well but I can still
like see skin so it's not full coverage
whew so far so good for the Dior skin I
just feel like it I just feel like my
skin looks really nice so far I'm really
diggin that but we'll see how everything
you know goes on top of the foundation
of course I'll have to see how it lasts
all day I mean those those first
impressions I will be coming back and
doing a review video of course on
everything that I purchased in the
you sail because I won't be able to try
out everything in this video I have
those fancy I should say tall cotton
wipes I have some Lula Hendrickson
skincare and things like that I have two
different pairs of lashes I'm not gonna
put one lash on and a different latch on
so I will be doing a full review video
but first impressions very happy with
this one really random but I thought I
would add this in because it's also from
Dior this one was sent to me from
actally to review and I saw this on my
free store and I really wanted to get it
and I just thought I could just pop over
here real quick and talk about it cuz I
actually kind of considered I was like
maybe I could spray this on my face if
like the shade match wasn't there or the
coverage wasn't there I don't know I was
like maybe I could mix these two but I
don't think I need to mix anything with
this foundation this is the Dior air
flash spray foundation I was too curious
when I saw it on my actually store I got
it out of pure curiosity I was like wait
a second what and does this work so I
got this shade 300 and I mean literally
it is spray foundation and you have to
shake it I give to shake it really good
you hear that little jitter in there
shaking around you have to shake it
really good but when you spray it which
I don't want to spray it because it
sprays foundation it's not just like a
you know facial mist or anything it
sprays foundation obviously because it's
a spray foundation but it really comes
at you like hard and fast when I'm using
it I'll early spray one side of my face
and I spare the other side of my face
and then I take a beauty blender and
blend it in it was a little challenging
at first to get used up to get used to
but I like the way that this one looked
on my skin like the final effect I like
but I think the concept of the spray
foundation is just a little bit like too
much for me I don't think this would be
like a go-to I think I'll stick with my
regular foundations more but I didn't
mind the way that I looked on my skin I
still thought it looked pretty good but
I feel I mean I'll kind of like compare
the two together and see what I think
but even like first impression boys I
can tell that I like this one more I
mean I'm just I guess I'm just much more
of a traditional girl so this type of
packaging and the pump just gets me more
but I even like the way that it's
sitting on my skin even more even though
when I first use this when I was like oh
I do like that I still like this one
more but I
I mention it because it was the or I
have my concealer on and said so next
I'm going to jump into the target park a
princess chisel palette now I did pick
this one up from Ulta because it's not
to Sephora yet I hear it is coming to
Sephora a lot of comments asking to try
this one out in my haul video so I'm
just going to go ahead actually first I
just want to swatch everything of a halo
and then enhance and then carrots and
then princess cut and then they last to
our angle and then crown everything is
really really soft so these are these
swatches on my hand here so I would say
for the first two powders the first one
is more white and then the second one is
more yellow and then we have some
contour shades and then bronzer shades I
really enjoy face palettes I have a lot
of face palettes I sigh a lot of face
palette
I like having more options in here so
for under here when I'm thinking is that
I could use this shade to like set my
eyes set my concealer under my eyes
which now I'm mad that I already said it
so I could have used it with this so I
will have to try that but then also
carrot looks to be like a really good
contour shade for me and then angle
looks like to be a good bronzer shade
the only one that I don't think I would
get a ton of use out of is crown but you
could also use these as eye shades as
well and I'm gonna let you guys know
something really embarrassing about me
right now I am someone who when I travel
I often forget I shadow palettes let
that sink in that's a true story
one time I even went on a trip to Vegas
didn't bring one eyeshadow palette I
went and stayed at a friend's house the
other day the other day it was like two
months ago because we were getting up at
like 5:00 a.m. to go tailgating for a
football game and I get there and I was
like hey didn't pack any eyeshadow felt
that was only a couple months ago I was
like what is wrong with me so I
literally used a contour shade in my
crease yeah I love makeup have lots of
eyeshadow palette to just forget to
trouble with them so so hey could I have
that option in this palette but I do
still want to go ahead I want to try
these on my face I would just want to
make sure that I will be able to give
enough you
out of it because it was at $46 so you
know I'm just gonna have to play with it
a couple times and see so I'm going to
contour what these Sigma F of 6 so I
just put a little bit of that carrot
onto the brush and then I'm just going
to sweep it underneath my cheekbones
here cuz that's the only thing like I
understand that it's a chisel palate but
I'm like ah even if there was like a
blush in there you know that could have
been really pretty of that sort of thing
but we'll just see I just want to make
sure I get enough use out of it I was
really attracted to it did the double
take put it in a will I buy video that I
wanted to buy it go ahead and make sure
because I also you know I don't want to
spend money on makeup but I'm not going
to get enough youth out of now I've
gotten a lot of requests to compare it
to like the clay play palette to like if
you have the clay play do you need this
so I'll be sharing that as well when I
do my review video I will let you guys
know
so I'm also gonna take that shape just
kind of slightly down my nose I'm gonna
take these Sigma f30 and dip that into
angle and use that to bronze up the skin
believe I just told you guys that like
super embarrassing Sigurd about me I
feel like I'm no longer allowed to be a
beauty youtuber like I'm done I'm kicked
out I'm kicked out man I'm kicked out
take my card take my key going home
alrighty so that is some contour and
bronzer and some swatches using the
Tarte Park a princess again you know of
course this is just first impression but
I felt like everything went on really
nicely I like how the contour and
bronzer look I like having a few other
shades in there I am just gonna have to
be playing with this one for a while
making sure that it's worth the forty
six dollars making sure the clay plate
isn't too similar to it and that I don't
need both of my collections so I plan to
do my review video and about two weeks
maybe two to three weeks we are doing
some holiday traveling and things like
that for Thanksgiving so it might be
more around three weeks but I will
definitely be doing the review video and
sharing my thoughts on the perk app
princess next I do want to add some
lashes my camera's getting ready to
overheat and I know I need still a fill
in my brows off-camera as I might as
well put some lashes on while I wait for
my camera to cool down the joys of
having the sony a 5100 so I did pick up
two
different pairs of lashes from the sales
because that's how I roll and I love
lashes and it just says what it is so I
got from who WV the affair lashes number
12 and then I also picked up another
pair from at blinking Beauty I didn't
mention these in my haul video but they
hadn't come to me yet because I
purchased them the second go-around for
vib Rouge so these are the bomb best
lashes of Rama blinking butte so they
are so gorgeous I don't know which ones
I want to try I just more blinking butte
the other day so I think actually I'm
gonna go ahead and go with my Buddha
Farah lashes they look super similar you
can tell that I have the style when it
comes to lashes so I'm gonna go ahead
and pop on the Buddha lashes if you've
noticed we were puppy sitting and the
puppy got ahold of my lashes why I'm
gonna go ahead and put these on
off-camera
fill in my brows and I'll come back to
show you what the lashes look like and
we'll finish off the eyes I am gonna add
some blush off-camera too because I
don't have blush that's all I'm doing
if browser on lashes are on here what
the who defero lashes all look like I
haven't decided yet I don't know if
they're like dramatic enough for me and
I know some of you will be looking at
the lashes something like girl what are
you talking about but like I don't know
I'll just have to wear them see what I
think and love really long lashes up to
my brows and I know I get comments like
girl your lashes are too long and I'm
like okay world to live in because it's
not the safe world I live in that's just
what I prefer with my lashes and we are
all different with our makeup styles but
now that my lashes are on my browser on
I'm going to finish off the eyes and so
of course coming back into the toasted
palate I think what I'm going to do for
the lower lash line is just mix of
warmth and cozy two shades that we used
on the eyes I'm going to use my Sigma
e30 I'm gonna first go into warmth and
I'm just going to brush this onto the
lower lash line I did add a little bit
of brown liner to my waterline as well
and then I'm just going to use a really
small brush this one is the Sigma lo4
and I'm going to grab a little bit of
some more and I'm going to put that into
the inner corner and then also on my
brow
so I did not pick up a new highlight
during the sale but I did just recently
get the Sigma chroma glow shimmer and
highlight palette dissent in NPR so this
is what she looks like I've been wearing
and ferocious so much lately I think
it's a really cool color but I thought I
could dip into this one I'm going to try
to use something other than ambrosia
because I've been wearing it so much I'm
gonna try this a bedazzle shade right
here
and I'm going to use these Sigma f-35
and just apply this to my cheekbones I
do not think I would really be into the
iridescent I mean these go on so well
you just kind of have to lightly tap in
there and you're going to get a lot of
highlight but I didn't think I was going
to really like the iridescent miss to
the palate so my god I don't know I
don't know if that's like really my
thing and then I started playing with
them and I'm like okay I never mind I
actually like them so I guess you never
really know until you actually start
playing with certain makeup products
that's a really pretty palette as well
so that is what we used for highlight so
now we just need to finish off with some
lips we did get a couple different lip
options in the sale I did pick up the
funky Beauty cloth and I also got the
Hutu Beauty nude love's mini set so I
think I'm gonna thought how to apply the
gloss first just to see what it looks
like I don't think I'm going to wear
except on to wear a matte lip because I
think I am gonna film again right after
this but I thought I could at least
apply the gloss we can see what it looks
like and then you know maybe I'll love
it enough to keep it on but then we'll
try a Buddha mini cuz it's easier to
wipe off gloss gonna liquid lipstick I
really like the way that it smelled some
people in the comments are saying they
did not like the way it smelled and
someone even said she returned it cuz
she don't like the way it sounds and I
was like I kind of like the smell though
I mean it is a pretty gloss but I think
I would still have to wear it over a
lipstick I kind of thought and like why
I wanted to put it on is to see if I
would need a lipstick or if I could just
wear this just as a gloss and when i
swatched it in the haul video it looked
pretty pigmented so I was like oh you
could probably just wear this as a gloss
like oh you just follow some on your lip
but I need some sort of color I don't
like just a clear gloss on my lips
that's just not really my style I don't
think I would like this on its own but
I'll try it some other time what the
lipstick and see but this is what the
Effendi colossal looks like on its own I
wanted to still be able to show you in
case you were still curious about it I
mean still looks nice if you like a
clear gloss then you could totally go
for it it doesn't feel sticky a man
doesn't feel sticky at all so that's
awesome because I hate sticky gloss so
yeah I'm gonna go ahead with this off
and we'll put on a hooter lipstick so I
did post a swatch a photo on my
Instagram of all four of the lipsticks
from the nude set collection so LSR over
here so you can see it but the shades
that I'm going to try out today is wyfy
I really liked this one and I asked in
that Instagram post like which shader
you feel in the most and so many people
said wifey or they love wife either the
own wife eh so I wanted to give white
Fiat rice there is a wifey it is a nude
it is still drying down but oh my gosh
and I love it I do really enjoyed the
Hooda lipsticks I mentioned them in my
top seventeen a 2017 video I don't even
know how many I own now maybe like seven
I don't even know I own a lot of them a
lot of our minis I love buying mini
lipsticks I think there's a great value
I'm really excited to add more to my
collection some of my favorites so I'm
gonna go ahead and let this dry it down
I'm gonna hit my face with some setting
spray and then I'll come back to wrap it
all up so here is the finished look at
that I came up with today using some of
the items that I got her this for a vib
sale I hope you guys enjoyed seeing me
create this look so I didn't want to run
through all of the items that I use and
just give a little bit more of my
thoughts on them first up with the
target toasted palette so I liked the
way everything went on it definitely
reminded me of like the tartlet and
bloom palette which I own a lot of
people were asking me if I thought these
shadows were like super powdery or like
someone asked if they were like the
subculture pellet would just a no to me
I feel like the Turla in bloom palettes
I think those shadows are a little bit
more powdery and these to me are the
exact same so I think that you're
getting a list
formula in the tartlet and bloom that is
me only trying it once and only trying
what like four shades out of it so I
mean I my full review will be coming but
so far I would compare it to the tartlet
and bloom I like to just find all the
foundation I think I'm actually like the
most excited about the foundation out of
everything that I use in the video
because this was one where like my first
impression is so good like I am anxious
to see how it wears the whole day I'm
excited to try it out I did use a
mattifying a primer underneath this one
I'll try it with a few different primers
too and see what I think about it so I
can get my full review put together but
as I was putting it on my face I was
like oh my gosh I think I'm going to
really love this foundation so for the
Tarte of Park AB Princesa palette again
my only concern is that I would not be
able to get enough use out of it but I
want to play around with it I want to do
even like I looks with it I want to see
how versatile it can be packaging is
amazing mirror is amazing these big
little shades are awesome if you love
face palettes like me you probably are
drawn to it because I like like I said
like I want to buy all the face palettes
and I don't know what's wrong with me I
did get asked if I would do like five
best and worst face palettes or my
favorite face pallets if you guys want
to see a video like that please do let
me know before the hooda lashes I mean
so far I do like them I could maybe
reach for them on days when I'm not
trying to be super dramatic but I still
want decent lashes I really do like them
though so far I do like the hooda lashes
I've tried the Samantha ones in the past
and I do like them they're easy to pop
on and I feel like they're very
comfortable wear them the entire day
just to make sure that they don't ever
get too heavy on my eyes or anything
like that but I did like the style and
again these are in Farah for the
affinity glass I'll be excited to try it
over like a nude or like a brown
lipstick and see how it looks over it
because by itself I guess I was just a
little bit surprised because I thought
by itself it would be more pigmented
it's not something that I would want to
wear on its own but I'll be trying this
out over some lipsticks and I'll let you
know what I think
finally a for the Huda mini liquid
lipsticks I love this color in white V
mmm-hmm I love this color this is
totally my type of nude I think it is
gorgeous
like I said already I really do love the
hooter formula I own several of her
liquid lipsticks I highly recommend them
for me I'm someone who I like a thinner
type of liquid lipstick the hooter ones
are definitely thinner they are a lot
more watery you do want to wait probably
about I would say maybe a minute after
applying them and make sure that it does
dry down all the way because otherwise
it can be kind of sticky at first you
notice with hers you do want to let it
sit for a little bit so that's just my
purpose with liquid lipsticks if you're
someone who likes something like really
mu C or drier I don't think that you
would like to who two lipsticks but for
me and what I prefer these are what I
enjoy and I also find them to be very
long-lasting I always have a hood a mini
in my clutch when I go out because it's
just a staple for me and I feel like
these are just the bomb and that's why I
bought four more very excited for these
so I love this color but then after that
that's gonna do it for this video I
really hope that you guys enjoyed it how
could you think of everything that I
tried out on my face down below and
other than that if you guys didn't
enjoyed this video I hope that you'll
give it a thumbs up I hope that you will
also consider it subscribe me before you
go and I'll catch you guys in my next
video
