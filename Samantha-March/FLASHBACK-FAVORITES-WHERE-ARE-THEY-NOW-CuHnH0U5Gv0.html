today's video is going to be a flashback
of Friday a style video I haven't done
one of these on my channel in a while
but I've been meaning to so basically
what I'm doing today is I'm going to be
talking about some of my past favorites
and just charting over are still my
favorites if I still have them in my
collection things like that so I'm gonna
be focusing on April in May of 2017 so I
looked at my make up monthly for those
months I wrote on everything and that
was in my favorite section and I'm gonna
chat about if I'm still loving them if I
would still consider them a favorite so
if you're ready for a new a flashback
Friday video well why don't we go ahead
and get started so I have a lot of
favorites in the month of April I was
actually thinking about doing maybe like
April May June or March April May or
something like that but when I saw the
list for April I was like okay maybe I'm
only gonna do two months so this isn't
the longest video ever I think it's
because my birthday is in March so you
know I get birthday gifts it's easier to
splurge on yourself when it's your
birthday and you typically get like a
little extra rewards or bonuses from
like Sephora or Ulta and then also
typically the vib sale and all the 21
days of beauty is somewhere around my
birthday
which is a March so I think that kind of
explained why April was such a large
list I thought was interesting cuz I had
quite a few brushes that I kicked off
April with so I mentioned the Mota
metallic brushes and yes I still love
these of these three particular brushes
from the Moto metallic line I use almost
every single day
this one the super crease if you watch
any of my like tutorial or get ready
with me style videos you almost always
see this it's just one of those staple
brushes for me it's just use it to apply
a light shadow over my eyelid primer I
mean it's such a simple task but it's
one that I do every single day and this
is like my main brush for it I also
really love the contour brush which
looks like this if you can see it's
sturdy because I love it so this is a
contour brush that I use almost every
single day I like how it's like just
nice and small can get right in there to
contour and then the other one that I
use all the time what is this one called
oh I think this is called the buffer
brush but the writing is kind of worn
off it's the buffer brush though
and honestly I like to use this for
bronzer it doesn't necessarily look like
one of my like traditional bronzer
brushes but it's like it's dense but not
like it's not like the contour brush
it's just a little bit bigger and I feel
like it just gives a really nice bronze
all over the skin so yeah these three
brushes I still really enjoy and another
brush that I mentioned in there it was
this one here from ELF and this is the
104 contour brush and yeah this is
another brush that I use quite a bit
it's really really densely packed in
there so a lot of times what I'll do is
I'll stamp the contour on and then just
kind of lightly buff it up and then I'll
take my bronzer brush and really kind of
help bronze and then also kind of like
blend out the contour because this is
like really really firm but yet another
brush that I use very consistently
another brush that I had in there was
from morphe and this is the AR - I love
this brush I highly highly recommend
this brush it's from their rose gold
line which I think it's still available
on the morphe website but I love this
bronzer brush I got it off a Jacqueline
hell recommendation and also a lot of
people said this was like a dupe for the
Marc Jacobs bronzer brush which is you
know probably ridiculously expensive
I really enjoy it it's Big Daddy and
it's just really easy and really quick
to really get that all over bronze so I
really enjoyed this one I also had on
there at the morphe sponge this is the
flawless sponge I might actually just
use it to this one if you can tell I
really enjoyed this one as well and you
can find out on the alte website and
it's nice and affordable I actually have
two of these because I enjoy them so
much
I would totally repurchase them this is
definitely still a favorite I would
highly recommend the morphe sponge
actually had some more morphe in there
and these are the morphe liquid
lipsticks so I don't know if I would
necessarily say that these are an
absolute favorite anymore I feel like I
have found other lipstick formulas that
I just love and would continue to reach
for but I did recently do a lipstick
declutter and I only declutter drun from
morphe out of my collection and it's
just like a pretty dark lip on me but
the shade school girl which is a really
pretty like neutral pink I still really
enjoy and I don't know if this would be
available any more because it was a
collaboration with Orpha but vinyl is
like a hot fire fall liquid lipstick
color I absolutely loved it I like the
formula it's a little bit drying but
they're very opaque you don't need a lot
of
liked to get these on your lips and I
feel like they last for a little up for
a really long time for a little long
time they last for a really long time so
I do still like the formula I would
still recommend it like if you're buying
from the morphe website you're like oh I
only need you know eight more dollars
for free shipping or whatever it is well
I would recommend the liquid lipsticks
because I do like them I just don't
think I would say their favorite anymore
I also heard in there a couple items
from number seven this is the radiant
glow concealer I really do let this
concealer as well again I want to say
it's a favorite at this time but I bet
as I enter into the warmer months I can
see myself grabbing this one it is a
pretty light light to medium coverage
concealer but it does give you a nice
just a bit of a glow like a healthy
healthy glow on the under eyes which I
do like it is kind of like that that pen
applicator like you can't a click it up
here which is not my favorite style of
applicator but I do like this concealer
I've kind of been finding myself that I
lean towards the more more full coverage
but again I wore this a lot in the
summer last year so I have a feeling
going into summer I'll be reaching for
this one again and I also mentioned the
number 7 bronzer and these are called
the what are these called they don't
have like the name on them it just says
number 7 bronzer I want to say it's like
something shade bronze are smart shade I
guess I'll have it all linked down below
but I have the shade caramel and yeah I
love these bronzers I love the packaging
they have a mirror here I still
recommend this I still use this quite a
bit it's one of those bronzers that like
I have a vertical drawer for my bronzers
and I have like my four favorites 4 or 5
favorites in the front and this one is
right there in the front because I use
it a lot and I think it's really
beautiful so yeah this one is definitely
still a favorite too
so next up I had an eyeliner it
mentioned in my favorites this is from a
DHC and it's the liquid eyeliner this is
definitely still a favorite of mine I
recommend this constantly and it's like
a liner that I never hear anybody talk
about I get mine off of Amazon ivory
purchased these multiple times over and
I just really enjoyed this liner I'm not
the
set winged liner and I feel like
whenever I use this one I feel like I'm
getting a really good wing it's really
black it's really matte I like the
applicator on it it's the style that I
prefer for my liquid liners like I said
ivory purchased this many times I will
say that I'm finding some pretty bomb
liquid liners lately Sigma has a great
one out the balm I've really been
enjoying I felt like there was another
one that I was testing out that I'm
really impressed with but there's some
other ones that are finally I'm really
enjoying because I feel like I'm I've
gone through so many liquid liners and
I've just not been able to find a
favorite so when I found this one I just
constantly kept repurchasing it but I'm
glad I'm glad to see some other ones are
on the market that are pretty darn good
too but yeah I still highly would
recommend the DHC it's still a favorite
of mine I also mentioned is there the
Marc Jacob highliners I was just pretty
funny but yeah I had like a clear
obsession with Mark J 2 pi liners and I
really do still enjoyed these honestly I
would say that they're probably still a
favorite really high up there I
recommend them a lot I use them a lot
I've purchased a lot of different shades
I have three here I probably have three
more in my drawer I feel like they're
really easy to get onto the waterline I
feel like they last so so long these
guys last on me super long they have a
lot of different shades they actually
have different finishes matte and
shimmer they're expensive they are
pricey I think I've only ever bought the
Marc Jacobs eyeliners during like a vib
sale or during some sort of discount cuz
they're pricey but they are still really
good the Urban Decay ones are kind of
surpassing them for me I have urban
decay well I have a lot everybody came
on today but I have an urban decay 24/7
glide on pencil today so I kind of like
passing over the Marc Jacobs ones for me
but yeah I still would highly recommend
those
I really do enjoyed them I also had a
Kat Von D liquid lipstick on there this
is in Ludwig I have a mini I also have a
full-size anything the full-size is
still in my clutch I couldn't decide
what lipstick I run out to wear when we
went to a concert the other night so I
took the bow and arrow and lovely like I
was I was like I know I'm going with Kat
Von D I just couldn't decide which shade
I want it but yeah this is definitely
still a favorite I highly recommend the
Kat Von D everlasting a liquid lipstick
formula Ludwig is a beautiful light pink
and I wear it quite a bit so yeah that
one that's definitely still a favorite I
feel like I'm having a lot of still
favorites which is pretty darn exciting
I know
like a year I mean to me a year seems
like a really long time maybe it's not
like too long but I've only been a
beauty channel for I think June will be
my two-year mark so I can't really go
back you know a lot of years because I
don't have videos but still like a year
a lot can happen in a year a lot of new
makeup come out you know your makeup
styles or preferences can change so it's
pretty cool to see how many I still am
enjoying this next one though this is
from Tarte it's the rainforest of the
sea water foundation so this one is
actually in my project pan my 18 and
2018 project pan so I have like some
progress lines on the back here and I
also have the concealer in my project
pan as well and at first when I started
the project pan in January I was doing a
really good job of consistently using
the concealer and then I felt like it
was drying out my under eyes or just
kind of like I don't know irritating
just kind of noticing like dry patches
and I was like oh my what the concealers
at my powder like what is it so I
switched up concealers and it went away
so I was like okay I think it's the
Tarte concealer and then when I did a
check in I wasn't doing very good on my
progress for this and so I kind of
started using it again and I feel like I
don't know what's in this or the
concealer but when I use them very
consistently something about it my skin
does not like so there might not be the
best items to have in my project pan
like if I just wear it you know here and
there sporadically I don't notice
anything so I never did when I had these
you know in my collection prior to that
but since putting them in the project
pan and trying to use them something
about them is just not my skin isn't
vibing with it and I haven't really I
kind of backed off after that but even
still this is a bit of a darker shade
for me it's in light medium honey
so maybe during the summer time I'll try
yanks I think it'll match me a little
bit better and all of that fun stuff but
um I don't know I don't know how much
farther I'm going to get through with
this guy I would not consider this a
favorite anymore though I had two items
are from lorac in that video and these
are both from the Pirates of the
Caribbean collaboration that they did so
the first one here is the eyeshadow
palette so I still really do like this
eyeshadow palette I don't think I would
consider it a favorite I don't reach for
it a ton especially on camera because it
was limited
and you know it's just I know it's an
annoying thing but like when I wear
certain makeup and people ask me like
what is that and I want to buy that I
want to get that and it's like oh my
entire face is all limited edition now
you can't buy any of it like that's kind
of a bummer but I still reach for this
on days where I want to reach for it
maybe I'm not on camera and all that but
it has a nice mirror it has all these
fun shades in here I recently did my
eyeshadow palette declutter and I was
like you know I know that I don't reach
for this on a super consistent basis but
I still really do like those eyeshadow
palette and I like the colors in here
they're like unique enough to me that I
feel like it kind of can push me out of
my comfort zone it can get me to create
some different looks when I use them so
I still really do like this eyeshadow
palette would it still be considered a
favorite no but I do still like it and I
did keep it around in my collection
after I did the declutter now the cheek
palette honestly these are still
favorites of mine the lorac Beauty and
the Beast like I still do like the
eyeshadow palette and I kept the
eyeshadow palette and fairly confident
but the the cheek palettes the face
palettes and both collections topmatch
like I still continue to love them so
this is what the face palette looked
like for this and again it does have a
mirror net and then you have six
different shade I really like the shades
in here the highlights are phenomenal
they're so beautiful
but the blushes are really pretty is
Boman especially this middle blush right
here in Caribbean
I love these face palettes from lorac
and I want to say did Beauty and the
Beast come out first and I fell in love
with that face palette like I took the
Beauty and the Beast cheek palette on my
Arizona vacation with me because I like
it so much it's so pretty yeah these
honestly I know they're not available
anymore but it would still be a favorite
so next up on my list I have the Tarte
make believe in yourself I shadow
palette I really did like this guy I did
end up decluttering it when I did my eye
shadow palette declutter because it
wasn't all shimmer palette so I you know
trying to think illogically I was like I
know I don't reach into this a ton I was
kind of just using them as like
eyeshadow Stoppers and that sort of
thing so I wasn't getting a ton of use
out of it and I figured someone else
would enjoy it more than I was
I do remember quite liking that but yeah
I definitely won't be able to say it was
a favorite anymore and it has since been
declared
but another eyeshadow palette that I
mentioned in there this is the violet
Boss a Holy Grail palette and yeah this
is still a favorite of mine
I still talk about this a lot I still
use this a lot I still recommend this a
lot it was my first a violent boss
palette it has a big mirror here and
then my toes like but my tomes my shades
I love going into this palette to create
just a really beautiful like brown
smokey eye like it's one of my favorite
go to look sister's up around smokey I
think it's so pretty but I really like
the mats and the shimmers in here I like
the mattes even more but I really really
like this eyeshadow palette
yeah I'm still considered this one a
favorite I think a chocolate left me
quite a bit as well even though it's a
bigger palette it still comes with me a
lot and then the final item I had on
there for April was the Smashbox and
Casey Holmes collaboration the spotlight
palette in pearl and yes this is
absolutely still a favorite it's such a
phenomenal highlight palette you can
still get this it's no longer a
collaboration with Casey the
collaboration was limited edition but
the actual palette was not limited
edition so actually like when you look
on my palette like nowhere on it does it
say this is a collab with Casey Holmes
it was just like the box that said it
which I kept the box because that's who
I am and so I'm glad that I did because
I didn't realize that it wouldn't have
anything I mean it's such a little thing
obviously but you know something that
makes me excited but this is a
phenomenal highlight palette I still
reach for at a ton I had it in my March
Madness series because I just think it's
a beautiful highlight palette I love all
three shades I love the mirror I would
still highly recommend the Pearl palette
and then moving over to May of 2017 the
first item that I mentioned here was the
BH Cosmetics and Carli bybel
collaboration clearly see two of my
favorite youtubers
this was their deluxe edition of the 21
shade palette so again it has a mirror
in here and then you have a mixture of
these eyeshadow shades and then you also
have highlight shades in here I had the
original palette that Carly did with BH
and I ended up decluttering that one in
my declutter because this one is really
similar to it like there was some
repeats shades it's just a larger
palette you have more eyeshadows and
more
it's in here I still think this palette
is so beautiful I highly recommend it
still and I think this was one I don't
know if I had it in my March Madness but
I remember when I was doing like a
throwback like a throwback Thursday I
was gonna use like older makeup and I
get ready with me style video and I put
this one in the vote I think I had a
vote on like Twitter at the time it was
a while ago but I have this one on there
and I was like I just like those pellets
so much and I think it's so pretty I
love the tones in here I love the
highlights are absolutely stunning in
here but yeah I I don't reach for it as
much but I still would highly recommend
it and honestly like it still is a
favorite of mine like I can't get rid of
this one so next up is pretty funny to
see the Olay Daly facials on there the
five and one facial cloths so I did just
do a skincare favorites video talking
about my like current skincare routine I
c-can't a skincare favorites and these
were mentioned in their so clearly these
are still a favorite these are just
sewing and either just a little dry
makeup boy if you get them wet off your
makeup their scrub and the cleanser like
there's just so many cool benefits to
these I am getting ready to go to
Oklahoma City for four days and I
decided I am NOT checking a bag so I'm
really worried about liquids when it
comes to like makeup and skincare making
hip ass security and all that and I'm
like well at least I don't have to worry
about how I'm gonna take my makeup off
because these are dry cloth so that's
friggin awesome I really enjoyed these
highly recommend them and then also in
there I had the YSL the shock mascara I
just had to say
alright pH my why so shocked mascara it
is in my empty spoon which I really
didn't want to go through to grab it out
but my next empties video you will see
that YSL the shock mascara I had a mini
guy of it I think it was like a
100-point Ferg on Sephora I would
totally get a point perk of it again I
know it's a more expensive mascara
because it's by a self but it is really
really good I just don't wear mascara a
ton because I typically wear lashes so
it's harder for me to pay full price for
high-end mascaras but if I saw a point
perk of it for sure I especially love
getting many mascaras because they're
just easier for me to go through since I
don't reach for them as much it's a
phenomenal mascara though I really enjoy
it I'm kind of says it's not in my
collection anymore but yeah that one is
really good I also had on there a
perfume which I'm
not a big perfume person so that was
pretty fun to see but this definitely is
still one of my favorite perfumes this
is from McKenzie it's the flower perfume
you can find these at Sephora so I'll go
ahead and link it down below but yeah I
really enjoy this perfume and even like
look how look how like tiny of a dent
I've put in it but this is one that's
like really expensive and I don't want
to run out of it so it's like one of
those that's like my special occasion
perfume but it it smells so nice I have
no idea how to describe perfume but I
like light sense and more like light or
fruity sense and I feel like that's what
this one is but it just smells so good I
still highly recommend this one yeah so
it's one of my favorite perfumes and I
think the bottle looks pretty cool too I
also had on there an item from ELF this
is the Saint Lucia face duo yeah I still
really enjoyed this guy as well and I
can't remember feel like I was just
talking about this in one of my videos
but I don't remember which one it was
but it has a mirror on it it has a
really nice bronzer in here and this is
kind of like a blush highlight it for me
it just kind of depends like in the
summer time I can use it more as a
highlight like right now I could use it
as more as a blush but the bronzer is
really nice and this is like four
dollars or something four dollars for
two really big products in the friggin
mirror how like I don't even know how
you go wrong with that now this is a
really nice product I still use it I
still highly recommend the elf face
duo's they're super affordable and then
the last item that I mentioned was
actually some more brushes of from
morphe so these came in the copper
dreams brush set which I don't think is
available anymore it kept going in and
out of stock but I think it was limited
edition and I don't think you can get it
any longer but I said that I really
liked the eye brushes out of their the
face brushes I thought were pretty
scratchy and I didn't enjoy them on my
face but I liked the eye brushes and
especially these three blending brushes
but unfortunately it was probably after
like you know I'm gonna say like five
times for something of washing them they
got really scratchy on me and to the
point where I don't remember which brush
I was using one day but I was using one
of these brushes one day to blend on my
eyelid and I had to go switch brushes
because it had gotten so scratchy and it
was irritating my eye so much so I don't
know what that was about because when I
first got them they were soft and fluffy
and nice of my
and then after washing them a few times
I was like um what happened to this so
that was pretty unfortunate these would
not be a favourite anymore but after
that that's gonna do it for today's
flash my Friday video so that's gonna be
everything for today's video looking
back on my old favourites from April and
May and letting you know which products
still are in my collection some have
been decluttered which ones would still
be my favourite and which ones I've
changed my mind about that you enjoyed
this video if you want to see more
flashback style videos uh please do let
me know but other than that that's gonna
do it for today's video if you guys
didn't enjoy it I hope that you'll give
that thumbs up I hope that you'll also
consider subscribing before you go and
