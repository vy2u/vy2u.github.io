today's video is going to be a new a
flashback Friday a type of video I may
be doing something a little bit
different here this was a suggestion
from Susie I'll tread and sort of
screenshot here she said I know you have
plenty of video ideas but just curious
if you could do a video looking back at
the products you bought last November at
the VIP sale and if you regret them or
still use them etc so the Sephora vib
sale is going on right now so I thought
that would be a really fun idea so I
went back I watched my video from last
year November all the items that I
hauled and I'm just going to run through
each of them and let you know what I
think of them if I still use them if I
repurchase them and all of that fun
stuff so big thank you to Susie afford
us a flashback Friday type of idea and
yeah let's go ahead and get started
before I jump into it I did want to say
that I will be doing it was the for a
vib sale haul of course I will I did my
wishlist and recommendations video I'll
have that one that link down below in
case you're interested in watching it I
am a vib Rouge I'm filming this on
Thursday I'm trying to decide if I'm
going to place another order on Friday
or not because Rouge gets to shop twice
this year for whatever reason so still
trying to decide if I'm gonna make that
order if I am I'm just gonna do my hull
all together because it only be a couple
more pieces that I want to pick up and
it wouldn't make sense to break it down
into two hauls if I'm only gonna haul
like two items the next time so I'm just
deciding about that but it should be
coming up within the next week or so
I'll show everything that I picked up in
the vib sale though jumping into the
video I thought the flashback Friday
type of idea was super fun if you guys
have any other ideas let me know I did a
flashback Friday like fall favorites
video a couple weeks back maybe a month
or so back I'll leave that one listed
down below as well and I just went
through my favorites from last fall and
then talked about them again and so I
thought this one was a really good idea
too but if you have any other ideas of
course do let me know but the first item
that I hauled in that video was a from
Tarte these are the pack your bags and
9/11 under eye rescue patches I did go
on to repurchase these I purchased them
for the first time during the vib sale
last year and I did repurchase them
either once or twice I want to say twice
because I want to say once was from the
Sephora website and then once was from
the Tarte website I think so I did end
up really liking these they are $24 and
you get four
our packs they look like this I still
have one left from this one so it comes
with four of these so you get the two I
gels I really did like these but I'm
just a huge fan of under eye gels under
eye care in general I always use an eye
cream I was just talking about a couple
ice creams in my most recent makeup
monthly I mentioned two as a favorite I
love using eye gels I use them all the
time especially with winter coming up
and I do get like really dry under eyes
these are awesome
so I have repurchased these a couple
times but I have pretty much switched
over to the patch ology i jealous now I
talked about patch ology a lot there's
like one of my favorite skincare brands
I've been using their lip gels like
crazy because my lips are dry right now
I use their eye gels I use their sheet
masks and all of that and you can get
like a 50 count or something on the Ulta
website for like $30 or it's a 30 count
for 50 dollars or something like that I
don't know and then you can use your
coupons on them and get your reports and
all of that so I and then I have
received PR from pathology as well so I
have a ton of their eye gel so that's
basically what I'm using because I did
kind of think $22 for only for was a
little bit expensive so I've kind of
switched over solely to them but I still
do have one eye pack here and I did go
on to repurchase these a couple times I
really did like them it's still a really
good option if you just really loved her
in general and you're trying to find
more items to purchase from them I did
really really enjoyed these so next up I
purchased a huda beauty lip contour set
and I was just talking about hooter in
wasn't my top 17 of 2017 I think it was
and I said I can't actually remember if
I found who to beauty and started buying
her lipsticks in 2017 or late 2016 it
was late 2016 because the November vib
sale last year was the first time that I
purchased her liquid lipsticks and this
was the set I bought of course like I
just said I mentioned it in the top 17
of 2017 so these clearly are a favorite
and they really are so what came in that
lip contour set was a lip liner and then
also two mini liquid lipsticks I think
the entire set was $24 and a regular
sized liquid lipstick is $20 so I
thought it was a really good deal
because
I love having mini lipsticks because
they're super easy to travel with
bombshell which is this one is always in
my clutch because I love it and also you
know I have a huge lipstick collection I
love wearing all different kinds and
colors and you know formulas of
lipsticks like it's so hard for me to go
through a full one so why not get minis
I thought that was a great deal so the
shades are in bombshell and trend setter
two of my absolute favorites this one is
more of a brown nude and this one is
more of a pink nude and I just love them
and then the corresponding lip liner was
in trendsetter I did like I said I will
be doing my haul video but I did
repurchase another huda beauty lip set I
mentioned it in my wishlist video I said
I was gonna buy it sneak peak I did buy
it and so I have four more mini hooter
liquid lipsticks on my hands now so I'm
very excited about that but this is one
of my favorite liquid lipstick formulas
if you haven't tried to add a beauty yet
I do recommend them I apologize if like
my nose is really red or if you can tell
my voice that I'm sick because I am sick
I'm getting a cold and really frustrated
about that so I feel like I keep looking
in the viewfinder and my nose is like
Rudolph red I'm like oh man but we're
gonna keep pushing through we're gonna
keep pushing through the next item that
I bought in the vib sale is from a
first-date Beauty these are the facial
radiance pads to help exfoliate tone and
brighten these I have been repurchasing
it since forever I'm pretty sure during
the VIP sale these for a repurchase I
can't remember when I started buying
these I remember the first thing I
bought from first-day beauty was a set
and it included like a mini guy of the
facial radiance pads and I just
absolutely fell in love with them I
basically always have these on hand they
are some of my absolute favorites I do
enjoy first aid beauty as a line in
general I've tried a lot of different
items from them and I've always really
enjoyed them but I typically always have
these and I buy them in the 60 count I
just put the big guy
I love taking these traveling with me I
just feel like they're really nice just
to like once I take all my makeup off I
like to use these also to make sure that
I got all my makeup off and it seems
like even if I double cleanse I swear I
come in with these pads and I still have
makeup residue on my face I'm like ah
but it also does you know exfoliate it
kind of leaves me a little bit tingly
but first day Beauty in general is kind
of
geared towards people with sensitive
skin who does myself so I really like it
because I do feel like it's exfoliating
my skin but without you know making my
skin too brighter or being too harsh so
I typically always have these on hand so
also I had to dig this out of my empty
storage so that was fun this is the
Tarte friction stick I purchased this
last year during the November vib sale
of course and I recently used it up it's
been in my empty spoon for probably
about a month I really need to film an
empties video I have so much in there
but the Tarte friction a stick was in my
little empties bin I love this guy and
I'm actually like once I started
watching that video and I saw this I was
like Samantha why did you not order that
in the VIP sale so this is an item that
I'm considering getting tomorrow when
this sale starts for me again so I was
like duh you love this thing
I really do I like a lot of tert
skincare I like a lot of their makeup
but I also have found that I like a lot
of their skincare as well but this one
really impressed me I won't take the cap
off because you can't see anything
anyways but it's just a exfoliator stick
and this is what I loved to have in my
shower I always try to have some sort of
mask or exfoliator or something in my
shower because I think in the shower is
one of the best times to exfoliate the
skin I weight a little bit like I
shampoo my hair and like wash my body
and stuff and then when I have
conditioner in my hair I'll put the mask
on so I can leave it for a while as the
conditioner sits in my hair at the mask
on my face because the steam in the hot
water helps like open up your pores and
then you know that your skincare is
really getting in there so I always have
this in my shower and I thought it just
was really handy because sometimes I get
kind of annoyed even though I'm in a
shower if you have a mask and you're
like getting it everywhere and then I'm
having to clean my shower and mmm that's
why I like the friction stick because I
felt like it was no mess it was also
really easy to travel with because it's
in stick form super easy to travel with
and I would throw this in my travel bag
quite a bit so I'm highly considering
picking this up during the sale and if
you've been wanting to try Turin
skincare or if you want a like easy to
use exfoliating stick I would recommend
that the friction stick so also during
last year's at vib sale I bought a
Beauty Blender
this is like Beauty Blender the pareja
and not just any
sort of you know beauty sponge this is
the Beautyblender and i bought mine in
black I still have one this is not the
original because I know that Ares ate
that one along with several of my other
beauty sponges but I have gone on and
repurchased at the Beauty Blender I do
really like these but I feel like I
would need to purchase them either with
a sale or if I have like a gift card or
some sort of like double cashback on
eBay or something because they are $20
and I feel like I've just been able to
find so many other sponges that I like
just as much if not more than the Beauty
Blender for like five six seven dollars
like morphe L'Oreal flower Beauty like I
have a ton of different Beauty sponges
that I think works so well that are less
than ten dollars and this one is twenty
dollars so I still have this one it's
probably on its last leg I remember
exactly when I purchased this one but I
know that it's about ready to be tossed
as well and I don't know if I would
purchase another Beauty Blender like
maybe if there was a sale but I feel
like I love especially those three
brands that I mentioned and then morphe
and Laura Yale you can get those at Ulta
too so it's always a really good price
there I feel like I just loved those
even more but the Beauty Blender it's
not bad it's not bad it's just pricy I
kind of forgot that this happened
another reason where I love these
flashback videos but last year during
the Sephora vib sale I bought the
Anasazi Beverly Hills Mountain
Renaissance palette I totally forgot
that but once it popped up I was like oh
yes I do remember because when this
released I was like oh no surely I don't
need that palette that's okay like
around this time last year I think I was
still on my like I'm done I should
appellate junkie I don't need to buy
them all and then this release and
everybody was like this is the best
eyeshadow palette of life if you don't
have it you are not in the cool Club and
I was like ooh girl you got all messed
up and every time I would try to buy it
it kept going on the stock and out of
stock both at Sephora also Nastasia
website I was like crap what am I gonna
be a part of the club and then I could
not believe that it was back during the
vib sale especially because of last year
I was the lowly vib I have not hit Rouge
status yet until the sale wasn't but
when I was actually shopping the sale I
was a VIP which my eye
shopping second after the Rouge and I
was like no way it's not gonna be
available too many people are gonna buy
it
and it was still available so I was so
excited to get the palette especially
for either the 15 or 20% off I don't
remember what it was last year at this
time for VIP but I was so excited to get
this for a discount and of course the
modern Renaissance is one of my favorite
eyeshadow palettes I love this guy I use
it so much this has come traveling with
me I've used this for like bridesmaids
looks multiple times over this is
definitely just one of my favorite
eyeshadow palettes I was so excited to
get it during the sale and that was kind
of a fun flashback moment because then
all I could remember all those memories
that came rushing back of like not being
a part of the club I didn't have the
matter of Renaissance and then I finally
got it and I was just so so excited
about it the last thing that I purchased
in the Sephora vib self for me in that
video I actually showed quite a few
things that I was putting into my next
giveaway I don't really do that anymore
I just kind of keep it on the low down
until I post my giveaway video but
definitely during the VIP sales or at do
any sort of sales I try to stock up on
giveaway items because I still even
though I'm getting more PR lately I can
put some items into my giveaways but I
still buy a lot for my giveaway so it's
so helpful when there is a sale going on
so I was kind of showing in that video
when I was getting because I remember I
showed the Becca it's called like the
blush with a light palette and I saw it
in my description box I was like I do
not have that palette what how did I
forget that I bought it what did I do
with it and then when I was watching the
video I was like this is what I'm
putting in a giveaway like that makes
much more sense I knew I didn't have
that palette I was very confused but
also the last thing that I bought for
myself was actually one of those Sephora
favorite studs it was called the
extravagant I set and I purchased it
because I really wanted two things in
that set and if I purchase them
individually it would have been the
entire price for the whole rest of the
kit I ended up keeping one more item
from the set and then everything else I
did put into a giveaway so it kind of
like worked out I was buying some things
for me and some things for a giveaway
but the items that I was most excited
about in the kit was this pair of who WD
eyelashes in the style of Samantha these
are some of my favorite lashes I wear
them
all the time I repurchase them I don't
even know like five or six times maybe I
really have lost count I have a pair in
my last drawer right now that is like
the pair that I'm using which I almost
wore today but I went with the blinking
view instead and these are a brand new
pair that are ready to go once those
pair once that pair needs to be tossed I
have a fresh ones ready to go these are
some of my favorites and these are
twenty dollars and then the other item
that was in there that I really wanted
was also twenty dollars and again the
entire set was 40 this was the Urban
Decay heavy metal clutter liner in
Midnight Cowboy
these were getting a ton of like rave
reviews this time last year when I saw
it in the set I was like you have to get
that set because you beat your lashes
you can get this liner you can finally
try it out and I fell in love with this
liner and it's so crazy because I just
actually got to the Urban Decay heavy
metal holiday collection sent to me in
PR from Urban Decay which is like wild
to think about but they sent me their
entire line of the heavy metal glitters
and it's the glitter that I'm wearing
today I believe this one is an ac/dc
that's on my eyes I'm loving it if you
guys are seeing me wearing a lot of
glitter especially like liner looks like
this it's typically always at the Urban
Decay the only other glitter said I
really love are the Stila glitters and
that's more fun I'm doing the Oliver I
look like I was wearing in my latest
will I buy a video that one's a Stila
glitter but if you're seeing like a
liner look like this one or if it's like
a liner in my crease typically always of
the Urban Decay heavy metal ones and
this time last year was when I purchased
my first one and fell in love with it I
highly recommend these they are $20 so
they are pricey but seriously I think
they're worth it I have so much fun with
them
the other item that I decided to keep
was this little of NARS eyeshadow it
does a little baby mirror in here it is
a mini a lot of the items that were in
the set were minis these for both
full-size which obviously lashes are
full size but the glitter was full-size
there was a couple other full-size items
I think maybe like a Laura Mercier item
was in there that was full size but I
kept this guy which is a mini of the
himalaya eyeshadow i kept it mostly just
because i hadn't really tried a lot from
NARS yet is a little mini guy but I was
excited to be able to try it something
from NARS so those were the three items
that I kept from the extravagant eyes
palettes I love the Sephora favorites
I'm always recommending them
i buy them quite a bit myself and even
last year I was buying them because I
think that they typically are really
good value so like I was saying this
time last year I was a vib
at Sephora my order for the vib sale the
night was a div Rouge so this time last
year I made it's a vib Rouge ah thank
you thank you so much I really
appreciate the congratulations and then
this was the gift you got for spending
$1,000 at Sephora in a calendar year
this little tiny NARS blush yep I still
got it I still wear it
I still wear this blush this baby was a
thousand dollars you know I still wear
this blush it's called Blair Geula I'm
not really sure how to pronounce it but
this little tiny baby blush is what you
got for hitting VI V Rouge so I still
have this phone but that was funny to
watch me I in the video I'm like I'm not
sure if I'm excited or horrified that I
was a VIP root I do like the the perk of
the free flash to day shipping because
even during the vib sale flash shipping
is not affected so a lot of times it'll
say like during the sale oh you know
we're experiencing a high volume of
orders it can take extra days to get to
you not if you're a root you're getting
it in two days I place my order for the
vib sale on Friday of last week I think
it started it came Monday afternoon and
I was like what up that's honestly
better to me than this little tiny blush
but hey that happened last year
so that has everything up for this
flashback Friday video revisiting
everything that I purchased in the last
year's so for a vib sale and my thoughts
on these products I really hope that you
guys enjoyed the style of video thank
you so much to Suseo for the idea if you
have any other video ideas in general or
flashback Fridays type of videos please
do let me know in the comments down
below
I love reading your suggestions and they
helped me out so much I will be doing
the vib sale coming very soon as stay on
the lookout for it because that will be
coming and as always if you guys did
enjoy this video I hope that you'll give
it a thumbs up I hope that you will also
consider subscribing before you go and I
will catch you guys in
this video by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
