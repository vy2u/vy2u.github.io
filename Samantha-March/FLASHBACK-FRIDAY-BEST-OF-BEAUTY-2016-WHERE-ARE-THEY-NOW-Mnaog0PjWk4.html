today's video is going to be a new a
flashback of Friday video and I'm going
it to be taking it back to my last year
beauty favorites video my beauty
favorites of 20 is 16 I'm going to be
going through all the products that I
listed off in that video as my yearly
favorites and just chatting where are
they now do I still love them but I
still consider them a favorite have I
gotten rid of them are we on a break I
don't know but I'm pretty excited to do
at this a flashback video so if you are
ready to see my flashback Friday for my
2016 m-pesa Beauty why don't we go ahead
and get started so of course my 2016
Vesta Beauty a video will be linked down
below I just recently did my 2017 at
best the beauty video as well so I will
also have that one in the description
box in case you are interested but the
first item that I mentioned last year
was a foundation and this was the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation I do
no longer have this foundation because I
completely used it ups one of my
favorite foundations it still is a
favorite foundation and I'm so meaning
to pick up another one of it because I
enjoyed it so much another foundation
that I mentioned that I love is again
from L'Oreal this is the infallible Pro
glow foundation and yes this is still
one of my favorite foundations as well
and this one is about empty I really
enjoyed this foundation I enjoyed the
coverage I enjoyed the log wear and I
loved how Chloe and fresh it made my
skin look so this one is definitely
still a favorite and the last foundation
that I mentioned last year was from
Clinique this is the beyond perfecting a
foundation and concealer once again
still a favorite of mine I recommend
this one so much it's full coverage but
it looks really nice on the skin like
this was the first more full coverage
foundation that I actually liked I
thought it looked really nice on the
skin but it's also super super long
wearing I recommend this a lot for like
brides for this one a lot when I was a
bridesman you know getting ready in the
morning having all these photos just a
long day and night ahead of me
I was using the Clinique beyond
perfecting and yes I would still
recommend this guy moving on to somewhat
concealers my favorite drugstore
concealer that I mentioned it was at the
maybelline fitme concealer and again yes
still a favorite I have repurchased the
Maybelline fit me concealer so many
times I'm really not sure I know it's on
more than one hand and I have purchased
the Maybelline fit me concealer SH and
this one is looking pretty janky I'm
really
kind of like scraping the sides of this
one I love this concealer I will
definitely repurchase it I think it's
such a good option from the drugstore
and the high-end concealer that I
mentioned last year look good but of
course it was the heart-shaped tape
heart-shaped tape like broke the
internet last year everybody was so
excited about the shape tape I
definitely was excited I actually need a
new one this one is running a pretty
pretty low but I've had it for a very
long time so I know I just need to go
out get a new one but I will repurchase
the shape tape it is pricey but I really
do like it it's a really nice full
coverage concealer and it still is one
of my favorites I do recommend this one
I have on others especially the urban
decay one that I like even more and I
mention the urban decay in my 2017 best
the beauty video but I liked everybody
can just tell you a bit more but I would
still repurchase the shape tip I do like
it especially for when I really do need
like full coverage under my eyes then I
enjoy that one a powder that I mentioned
that I really loved is the Maybelline
butter skin skin transforming powder and
I've used to really enjoy this one as
well this is what is usually in my
clutch I just find it really easy to
slip inside my smaller clutch because
it's still nice and compact but if this
is a really nice powder a nice mirror
and then I also like this kind of like
sponge applicator I think it's nice for
my clutch because that way I don't have
to worry about adding an extra brush in
there so I can use the powder and touch
up when I'm out you know nights out or
things like that so I really enjoyed
this one still I would still recommend
this one I just feel like it gives a
really nice finish to the skin and then
my high end powder that I recommend it
that I loved on was the pure of four and
one pressed powder I have been buying
this pressed powder from pur cosmetics
since I was in college so just since
last year I'm just kidding I have not
been to college for a very long time but
I have been repurchasing this a powder
for years and years and it still is one
of my favorites and yes I would still
highly recommend this I love wearing
this in the summer like sometimes if I
just wear a BB cream I'll put some of
this powder on top or even if I don't
need the BB cream if I feel like my
skins do it pretty well I'll just put
some of the powder on even out my skin
tone still one of my favorites this is
from wet and wild this is the mega glow
a contouring palette I still love this
one as well
I'm really happy to see this trend
hopefully would keep it give it Roland
throughout the video but yeah I still
really enjoyed this month and I actually
broke my original one and that I bought
and I went out and repurchased it
because I was like no I still want this
in my collection I really enjoy it and
it was like five dollars so it wasn't
bad to replace but I have a setting
powder here that I put for my under eyes
and then also a really nice contour
shade beautiful big pan and again I
really do like this one I had to go out
and repurchase it when I broke the first
one another setting powder that I put in
there was from Laura Mercier this is the
a secret brightening powder and I still
really enjoy this one I actually just
recommend it the other day someone asked
it goes on a YouTube video what my
favorite setting powder is I give a high
end and a drugstore option and still my
high end is the laura mercier secret
brightening powder I love the bright
under eyes that it gets even though I've
kind of gone away from setting powders
like last year I used to bake a ton I
was always baking I thought it was like
something that you had to do if you did
the tutorials and then suger and
tutorials and stuff like you had to bake
your face but I've kind of gotten away
from that because thought it was kind of
like an extra step that I didn't really
need in my makeup routine but if I am
going out somewhere I'm going to be gone
all day or at like especially that I do
like to set my makeup and I really like
to use this on my under eyes another
product that I mentioned and there was
this NYX this is the sculpt and
highlight a face duo so you have a
concealer on one end and then a contour
on the other end I really really liked
this guy but I feel like I don't really
love it so much anymore and I barely
barely reach for those like what I
notice with this one is that you get
very little product like on each end if
it tells you you get 1.7 fluid ounces on
each end and I noticed very quickly that
I was going through almost all of it and
I kept having to dip back in like even
doing just one under-eye I was having to
come in like three four or five times
constantly back and forth to get the
right amount of concealer on my under
eyes so yeah I don't love it as much as
I did last year and I've kind of stopped
reaching for it another one that I had
in there was from a Pierre cosmetics and
that was the Cameo contour stick and I
cannot find mine for the life of me I
know I didn't declutter it so I don't
know where it went
I
did repaint my office this year and I
had to move everything out of course
while we paint it and I know some makeup
got lost in the shuffle along the way I
sell I don't know if my cameo contour
just rolled away somewhere if I put it
in a drawer and forgot about it I don't
know but I went looking for it and I
could not find it but that was the first
time I realized that I couldn't find my
cameo contour stick in quite some time
so that kind of tells me that I don't
love it as much as I once did I did do a
ton of cream contouring last year and I
was really reaching for that for the
contour side of it I've noticed more
lately like within this past year I've
definitely been switching to more
powders and kind of like my contour
palette I really fell in love with face
palettes this year so I didn't reach for
that one as much because it was just
easier for me to reach into a face
palette but you know I don't love that
one as much as I did and I'm kind of
embarrassed that I don't even realize
that went missing that's pretty sad an
affordable bronzer that I was loving on
it was Physicians Formula butter browser
I still do really love this bronzer I
have mine in the shade light which is
really good for me right now during the
winter time when I am a little bit paler
I just busted this one out again the
other day I still like the way it smells
it still smells really nice and I did do
a recent bronzer declutter and I was
like no I cannot get rid of the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer and
these are pricey for drugstore so I was
like you know I'm keeping it and then
the high-end bronzer that I mentioned it
was from a Too Faced this is the
chocolate Soleil matte bronzer and I
actually did this is another sample size
and I decluttered my original deluxe
sample size 8 in my bronzer declutter
but I declared an X I was like well I
know I've had it for a long time it
probably does just need to be tossed
because it's been open for a very long
time and I was like and I know I got a
backup
I got it in like an Ipsy bag or some
sort of subscription bag as I knew that
I had this one on hand as well so I
didn't feel so bad to cluttering it
because I knew I have this one ready to
go so yeah I do still really enjoy this
bronzer it's one of my favorites it's
it's just a solid bronzer that's really
all I can say so a favorite affordable
blush that I mentioned that last year
was from Milani this is the Luminoso
blush at the Bates powder blush yeah
this was a and I mean still I feel like
still is considered a cult favorite on
YouTube I bought it
everybody was recommending it and in my
blush declutter I had to keep around
Luminoso it's such a beautiful blush
especially for spring/summer that's when
I really love it it's just a nice peachy
kind of glowy blush it's beautiful but
still love it still recommend it I also
put in there at this Smashbox blush of
trio this is the LA lights blush and
highlight palette in Culver City coral I
really like these and I felt like nobody
talked about them I was using mine all
of the time it has two really nice blush
shades in here and a highlight I think
they are all really pretty I will say I
don't reach into this one quite as much
as I used to I know last year I got a
ton of use out of this one and I really
enjoyed it but lately I don't reach for
this one quite as much so that's kind of
a bummer I need to this like reminds me
that I should pull this one back out
because I really did enjoy it and again
I thought nobody talked about it which I
thought was weird and this one was a
very hyped up palette this is from Becca
cosmetics in collaboration with Jaclyn
hill is the champagne and glow of face
palette this palette has gotten so much
love for me I still love this palette I
think it is absolutely fantastic it has
blushes and has highlights and have
champagne pop Prosecco pop I mean I love
this palette so much just so it's I mean
it's just yeah it's still a fave
syllabic and it's super dirty a couple
liners that I had in there these are
from colour-pop and they are their gel
eyeliners
I love these pencil liners from
colour-pop I recommend them so much I
use them so much I have like I don't
even know six different colors maybe and
I want even more there were like five or
six dollars they're very creamy on the
waterline and they're super long-lasting
like I think this is the longest lasting
a drugstore eyeliner that I have ever
tried so good if you're placing order
with color pop and you spend just a few
dollars more for like your free shipping
or whatnot I recommend checking out the
gel liners I also put in there this a
Maybelline pencil this is the master
precise skinny eyeliner I remember
loving this so much I think I actually
bought two of these like I went through
one and Bri bought another one but as I
started trying more and more eyeliners
from different brands different
companies I realized that I didn't love
this one quite as much I like it's so
light and so faint and it does fade
pretty quickly so I don't know I don't
know if maybe this one was just a bad
one because I remember loving the first
one so much and then being super under
by this one so I don't know if I got a
bad one with this one or what it was but
yeah I barely reach for this one anymore
so I feel like I have a lot better
eyeliners out there and then this other
liner is a from a Sigma this is the
wicked gel liner and this one got a lot
of love for me I have hit pan on the
bottom it's it's kind of a hot mess in
there I feel like I probably just need
to declutter this one and get a new one
you really do enjoyed the Sigma gel
liners if you're a big gel liner fan I
do say to check out the Sigma one I have
this one first so long I did not dry out
on me and I thought it was really easy
to apply I've kind of gotten away from
gel liners in 2017 as well lately it's
just been more of like the liquid liners
regular pencil liners that I have been
using to make my wings but if you love
Jolla and the Sigma one is good so
another eyeliner that I had mentioned in
there was from it cosmetics it was their
gel liner and I love that liner so much
I had a little deluxe sample sized
version of it and I lost it somewhere
and I was devastated about it and I was
like for sure I'm gonna be repurchasing
it and then I never did and when I saw
that come up on the list I was like come
and I always meant to repurchase that
liner but I never did it oh so sad but
moving on I did also put on there at the
market Jacobs a glow stick I think this
was just called as called spotlight the
spotlight glow stick so it's just a
cream highlight I do still really like
this one and I do think wish to keep it
around in my collection but I noticed I
wear this more in the summertime it's
just really nice and easy to kind of
like rub my finger around in there this
deodorant stick like looking highlight
and then just tap it onto the cheekbones
for really nice not subtle it's not
subtle at all but just a really nice
glow summertime glow that's mostly when
I use this guy or if I'm using the
highlight that I really like but I needs
more of an emphasis I will put a cream
down first and typically I reach for the
Marc Jacobs glow stick so I still do
really like this one I don't think I
would consider it a favorite anymore
but I still do like it and then moving
on to some palettes I have in there the
BH Cosmetics and Carli bybel palette now
this is the original one this is the
fourteenth color eyeshadow and highlight
palette and they redid the palette they
made a bigger one for 2017 and I
actually did feature that one in my
favorites video as well
definitely a step
from this palette for sure the
eyeshadows for better you got more
quantities in there and the highlights
were freakin phenomenal in the newer
palette I don't think this one is for
sale anymore I think that they were
discontinuing it when the new one came
out but but I would have said to get the
new one so I think when I do my
eyeshadow palette declutter which is
coming soon I think I can go ahead and
say goodbye to this one because if I'm
reaching for these shades of these tones
I'm reaching for the newer palette but I
still really enjoyed this one this was a
birthday gift and I really really liked
it
and then also in there I had the Too
Faced too sweet peach palette oh my gosh
this palette I remember there was so
much craziness around it
I was at my Ulta store at like 10
o'clock when it opened trying to get at
the peach palette and it was just like
madness
I do really enjoyed this palette I
reached for it a ton I my gosh I reach
for this palette so much like when I
first got it it was one of those things
where I was telling myself you have to
use something else but I felt like I
created so many different looks with it
I love the way that it smelled
I love the mattes and shimmers yeah this
one went with me everywhere I took a
break from Too Faced at the end of 2016
we're currently still on a break and it
kind of made me not reach for this one
as much as kind of going for my other
palettes but I do still like it I do
still think it's a really nice palette I
just want to consider it so much of a
favorite anymore the other one that I
had and there is the Smashbox a fotomat
eyes eye shadow palette I feel like I
talked about this palette all the time I
know I put it in an underrated makeup
video because I felt like nobody I've
talked about this one either same with
these Smashbox blush palette I really
liked them it did come with a brush and
I use this brush a ton I don't really
use brushes a lot in palettes but I
actually really liked that brush and
this is what the palette looked like it
reminded me a bit of like the Kat Von D
shade and light palette it's just an all
matte palette a lot of very neutral
colors but I like this one because it
gave me even more shades like there's a
really cool kind of like a denim blue
over here there was a pink over here I
used this palette so much I was doing so
many different tutorials with it both on
YouTube and Instagram I really liked it
and I just have not been able to find
myself letting it go yet like I still
enjoy this palette so freaking much a
palette that I had in there was a from
morphe this is the 3/5 of the original
35o palette again another
Pellatt that I just absolutely loved I
it took me so long to get this palette
because it was always sold out when I
finally got it I was so excited and
again I love this palette I used it so
much it's very dirty especially for me
I'm like very light handed when it comes
it to my makeup but to me like this is a
dirty palette and it kind of drives me
crazy with the revamped 3502 that came
out and the morphe chocolate hell
palette both of which I featured in my
2017 video I've very rarely reach for
this one anymore but I did enjoy it I
know I definitely got it was like
twenty-two dollars or something I
definitely got my $20 worth from that
palette another one I had in there this
one is from its heart it's the tartan
styled by her brush palette inside you
got six eyeshadows and then also a blush
again this is another palette that I
talked about so freakin much I love this
palette so much I took it traveling with
me all the time and again I just I loved
it I was telling people you know I know
it's limited edition it's a
collaboration but give it get it get it
was like $30 still one of my favorite
palettes still take it with me I'll love
it and then the other palette that I
mentioned for a favorite was probably
one that everybody mentioned knows a
favorite this is the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills of Modern Renaissance palette yeah
it's still a favorite of mine I still
take it with me so much I was a
bridesmaid back in May and this is the
palette that I used I love this palette
still highly enjoy it still would
consider the monodrama favorite had some
eyeshadows Singles that I mentioned that
last year these two are from colour-pop
and they are they're super shock shadows
and it is in truth and la la I did love
these shadows I used these together so
often I would put la la in the crease
and all over my lid and then I would
come in and just put la la which is a
beautiful like shimmer rose gold I put
that all over the eyes pop on some
mascara and I was good to kill it was
like my go-to look I really did enjoyed
these colors but overall the color pop
it super shock shadows they're just not
a favorite I felt like I tried so hard
getting into them because everybody
hyped them up and everybody on YouTube
would show their giant collections of
like their
5060 single color pop eyeshadows and I
remember feeling so much pressure to to
buy them and like yes they were only
five dollars but I also remember hitting
pan on one of them really really fast so
I was like wait a second I'm almost done
with this eye shadow like how is this
even possible no wonder it's only five
dollars but yeah I definitely want to
the colour-pop super shock shadows my
favourites anymore I barely barely
reached for these pulling these out kind
of made me a little nostalgic though
because I did that I look so often but I
definitely recommend the color pop of
pressed eyeshadows I think they are
miles better than these super shock
shadows and they did make it into my
2017 favorites as well I had some more
here from Anastacio Beverly Hills I
mentioned her single shadows in Birken
and then also burnt orange I did really
like these shadows but I barely reached
for the squad anymore of these singles I
am typically always going into the
modern renaissance instead and actually
burnt orange is in the modern
Renaissance as well but Burke and I
really like is like the classic
transition shade but again I feel like I
find those so much in my palettes and I
know a lot of people like to buy singles
because they kind of like to put their
own little palettes together but I'm
like I don't have time for that like I
need my palace that's what I enjoy when
I'm creating an eye look I like going
into one palette like yes I can reach in
for another one for you know your matte
white or whatever it is you need you
brow bone highlight whatever it is but
the majority of my look I want to create
with one palette that's just who I am
personally I know a lot of people are
very different but yeah I barely reach
into these enthusiast shadows oh that's
kind of a bummer mentioned three
mascaras last year and none of which I
no longer have I went through all of
them the Maybelline lash sensational to
me that's one of the like best or
drugstore mascaras every purchased that
one two or three different times I
believe it was I really really enjoyed
it that mascara I have used it up fully
though the other one that I mentioned it
was the Smashbox x-rated mascara I just
got rid of that one I believe in my most
recent mascara declutter I'm pretty sure
because it was basically like fully used
up and I knew I had it open for a while
again that is a balm mascara like bomb
mascara if you were looking for good one
to try it I feel like sparsh box has so
many good products and nobody talks
about them why is that
but the x-rated mascara was so so good
and then the other mascara that I
mentioned was the benefit roller lash
that's what it was the benefit roller
lash to me the Maybelline lash
sensational is almost like duplicate to
the benefit roller lash that's probably
why I love both of them the roller lash
mr. lash is really long and gives them a
nice curl and it was one of my first
like high-end
scarus that I really fell in love with I
know I did repurchase the benefit roller
lash as well I have used up all of them
since but all three I would still say a
favorite in all three I would definitely
still recommend I put into my favorites
video last year the Ardell wispy lashes
I was a huge fan of the ardell lashes
especially when I first started my
channel they were so affordable and I
thought that they were really easy to
use but they were also some of the first
lashes that I ever really used and I
mentioned this in a video once I think
it was makeup I changed my mind about
and I was chatting about the Maybelline
fit me foundations and I said that I
used to love those foundations so much
but as I started trying others I
realized that there was better out there
and I felt like that's kind of what
happened with the Ardell because there
were some of the first lashes I was
using I was like these are amazing
these are balm these are great and then
as I tried more lashes and more brands
and more styles I was like oh they
aren't quite as good as I thought they
were because there's better out there
have you guys had that happen to you
with any products because I feel like
that definitely how it happened to me
with the Ardell Busby's I do not
remember the last time I purchased in
her tell pair of lashes after I went
back to them like I tried out a bunch of
different brands you know I put pure and
blinking vitae in my favorites video for
2017 but I went back to our Dell at one
point and I tried to apply their lashes
and I struggled I struggled so much I
didn't like the way that they looked on
my eyes and I was shocked I honestly was
shocked I do still reckon I do still
recommend them if you are trying to
learn lashes because they are affordable
I know there's other affordable brands
too that you can get at the drugstore if
you're trying and you're practicing I
recommend to practice on a cheaper pair
like don't go out and buy the blinking
beauty twenty five dollar lashes and
then try to figure out what you're doing
because that's going to be a bit of a
waste of money but I would still
recommend it for that but there's just
so many more favorites I have now I
would not be able to consider Ardell
favorite so weird I also had in there
the eye lure and Vegas nay lashes and no
those are no longer favorites either I
feel like that was another thing where
everybody was talking about these lashes
and I was like you loved them girl you
know you loved them and even though they
were harder for me to work with when I
had him on I liked him but they were so
hard to put on and I finally realized
that even though I like the end effect
of them that there are so many other
lashes that
hop on so easier the fans are so much
easier to work with and I didn't need to
like keep trying to force myself to love
the I lower lashes because there's
probably other lashes out there I also
did have in there the hooter Samantha
lashes which I do still have I should
have pulled those out I do still like
the hooter lashes but again I think that
I'm moving towards other lashes that I
love even more don't really do like them
I feel like I would still consider them
a favor every purchase them a lot I wear
the Smith ones a ton but again I'm
finding more lash brands more and more
that I enjoy lashes that I mentioned
there were the ice lay and makeup Shayla
lashes I loved those lashes so much I
wore them so often I kind of it kind of
makes me want to see if they are still
available I knew that they were a
limited edition but I thought maybe they
were bringing them back and now I kind
of want to see if I can find them again
because man I love those lashes I wear
them all the time they were super like
unique and different for me they were
kind of more like shorter and spiky but
I thought that they were so cool on I'm
gonna have to see if those are still
around did anybody else have the isolate
and makeup Shayla lashes I almost forgot
about those I no longer have them but
man did I enjoy those alrighty home
stretch here next time I had some brow
products these are both from benefit I
mentioned the goof proof and also the
Gimme brow the goof proof is definitely
still a favorite of mine I reached for
this so much I've gone through pencils I
go back and forth between the shades 2
and 3 and it's just a one of my
favorites I also mentioned the Gimme
brow and this kind of takes me back
because you guys might know I was on
YouTube for probably six to eight months
without doing my brows and while people
were angry about that one it's so funny
because people are like oh kids thank
you seriously cuz you wear lashes that
you have fake nails I'm like it I didn't
do my brows for almost a full year so
like what I did that just always makes
me laugh to this day but when I got the
Gimme brow it's kind of like the fiber
it looks like a mascara wand it has
fibers in here this is all that I would
do for my brows before I felt might be
like fine I'm gonna do my brows that's
what I did now I only use the gimme brow
to kind of help set my brows or to give
them a little bit more of foremost as
well but I have the center the land of
doing my eyebrows thank you so much
figure but your big step over here for
me but you've proved definitely still
afraid gimme brow just okay for me
a couple tools that I mentioned I talked
about the Beautyblender like the
original beauty blender I have pretty
much since moved on from the beauty
blender at the beauty blender was $20 I
went through so many of them I purchased
so many of them the new the black the
pink oh my gosh I had them all and I
just realized that they're expensive and
there's a lot of other brands that make
really good ones I think I mentioned for
beauty sponges in the 2017 video and I
know off the top of my head L'Oreal
morphe flower Beauty those are all
affordable what was my fourth sponge
that I mentioned OSL miss glam and
that's almost claim isn't that
affordable but the three out of four
that I had named our affordable way she
worth under $20 so I just don't really
go for the Beauty Blender anymore to
pricey too pricey for me and then the
other ones that I mentioned in my video
was the Real Techniques diamond sponge
man I loved the diamond sponge I bought
like two or three of them but what I
realized with the diamond sponge and why
I stopped purchasing them after a while
was that mine was mine was breaking like
ripping too fast when I would be washing
it and that's why I had to buy so many
of them and you know I blamed it on me
you know it's my fault
soap is too rough my nails were digging
into it was a cloudy day I don't know
what was going on but I kept blaming
myself for and then finally I was like I
think it's the sponge it's a sponge
that's doing it so I stopped purchasing
the diamond sponge but yeah the other
ones that I mentioned cashed I feel like
this video is gonna be so interesting if
I do the flashback video next year cuz
like I want to see I want to see where
these all stand up but you need their
beauty sponge I would consider a
favorite anymore huh let's get ready for
some lip products I mentioned quite a
few last year and a look all nudes would
you would you look at that how shocking
I've really evolved have a nice the
first one that I mentioned was from
Maybelline this is one of their cover
color jolts excuse me in a stripped-down
yeah I still love this one I declared
the orange that I had when I did a
lipstick de-clutter but I had to keep
this one I love the color I love how
juicy it makes the lips we also
mentioned it the NYX soft matte lip
creams especially specifically in London
and then also Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi I've
been filming for a really long time okay
this is gonna be a very long video but
yeah these are some of my absolute
favorite nudes I highly recommend the
NYX soft matte lip creams they're
affordable they are really nice and thin
let's see I also mention
the next lip lingeries still really
enjoy these I know not a lot of people
did you'll see these featured in an
upcoming video I'm doing but I still
really like the lip Alondra raises
specifically in bedtime flirt and ruffle
trim some of my favorites I still reach
for them still would recommend them as
well
I also chatted about some color pop and
kathleenlights
lipsticks the only one that I still have
right now is in a point zero this is an
ultra satin lip point zero is just such
a unique like cool toned gray color I
had to keep this around but I have not
really been loving the colour-pop ultra
matte specifically but also the ultra
satins I feel like the formula goes back
way too fast so when I did my last
lipstick declutter I really decluttered
a lot of the colour-pop lippie because I
knew that they weren't really good
anyways but I did want to keep this one
around because I feel like it's a really
unique shade I also had in there from a
Kat Von D the bow-and-arrow lipstick
when I forever lasting liquid lipsticks
I had to go into my purse and dig this
one out because I just wore it the other
weekend I love this I mentioned Ludwig
in my 2017 video I really enjoyed the
Kat Von D formula bow and arrow is just
one of my favorite news Browns and then
I also mentioned in there the huda
beauty a liquid matte lipsticks I
mentioned trendsetter and bombshell I
still love both of those shades I still
love the huda beauty liquid mattes I
just purchased another set of four in
the Sephora vib sale I've purchased like
seven or eight huda beauty lipsticks and
I still really enjoy them and then after
the lip products that is it for the
splashback Friday video who would this
gonna be a long one but I know a lot of
people have been asking me if I would do
this one as well because I've been
having a lot of fun doing the flashback
Fridays for some of my past hauls and
things like that so I thought touching
on the 2016 favorites would be really
interesting I feel like majority wise I
still really love and joy would
recommend a lot of the products from
2016 but there was definitely those
items that I changed my mind about that
I decluttered and that I don't love or
would really recommend anymore so that
was really interesting it was fun to
take a trip down memory lane and
flashback to 2016 I can't believe how
fast 2017 went honestly this year went
by so fast I'm so excited to see what
2018 brings I cannot wait but like I
said I'll have it both my 2016 and 2017
