today's video is going to be a makeup
look since we are starting makeup free
of course but I'm really excited to do
this video for a couple of different
reasons this is going to be a flashback
Friday video these have been super
requested to do a makeup look using all
flashback throwback products products
that are a little bit older in my
collection maybe I haven't reached for
as much a lot of other channels do this
on one of the first channels that I saw
doing it was that girl Shay she does
throwback Thursday videos which are
really really awesome so I will have to
say his channel link down below but also
the other reason why I'm so excited to
do it because this is a collaboration
video with my friend Nicole Renee Cutler
Nicole a while back started doing her
flashback Friday series where she
incorporates a flashback eyeshadow
pellet into her videos and I have
absolutely loved watching her do them
and I've been noticing a lot of requests
for me to do items like that myself and
Nicole's name has continually been
referenced in there and so I thought
okay I'm gonna go ahead and do it and
you know I'll give him a cool credit and
all that good stuff and then I was like
pinnacle you want to do a collab with me
and she said yes and I was so excited so
I will have Nicole's channel of course
linked down below I hope that you will
go check her out she is so much fun to
watch she has so many videos I don't
know how she does it a student she makes
a ton of youtube videos and then she
also created Bailey's mission I love the
website for Bailey's mission that lists
it down below and I highly suggest you
go check it out especially if you are an
animal lover like me and Nicole is doing
really amazing things so all of that
will be in my description box but today
we decided that we are going it to play
around with the morphe 35o palette the
original morphe 35o so that's the
eyeshadow palette that I'm going to be
using in today's video and then we're
also going to be incorporating other
flashback makeup products into our
tutorial and I'm super pumped for and I
hope that you're excited to see some of
my old school picks that I decided to
use for this video but without further
adieu I'm sorry I know that was a long
intro but I had a lot to say but why
don't we go ahead and get some makeup on
the space but I am gonna start off with
my eyes like I usually do so I do have
them primed and then like I said I'm
using the original a35 old palette from
morphe so this is what the palette looks
like this was not
my first pellet from morphe but it was
one that i thought originally really
wanted it was just always a sold out and
I remember finally getting my hands on
it and I was so excited about it they
are releasing a 3500 - to celebrate this
being out for two years I do plan on
picking it up if I can get it when it
launches and if I can I will definitely
be doing reviews and tutorials and
comparisons and all that fun stuff but
it does have a matte white shade in here
so that's what I'm going to go in with
first to kind of set my primer and act
as a base and this is the Mota metallic
super crease brush I don't know why I
always have to look at this brush name
because I use it almost every single day
but I'm just gonna go and with that
first shade and just apply this all over
my lid and I haven't done a halo eye in
a while and that's kind of what I want
to try to do today I'm not the best at
them but we'll give it a shot so I'm
gonna come in with this shade right here
it's the third one down on the last row
and I'm just gonna use a small brush
this is a more heat 18 and I'm just
going to pack some product on the outer
part of my eye and I'm gonna start with
you know not a ton of product on my
brush especially because I'm using like
more of a hot Orange I don't want it to
be too overwhelming at first so I'm just
gonna slowly be building it up but I
just wanted to this on the outer part of
my eye and then once I feel like I have
it to where I want it I'm also going to
put that color on to the inner part of
my eye and then leaving the middle of my
eye blank for a different color like
halo eyes because I feel like they're
simple to do they're a little bit
different of a technique that I normally
do but I still feel like they are pretty
simple but for a while I like was not
being able to get the hang of it and I
swear just using smaller brushes really
helped so the smaller the brush is
usually the butter for the halo eyes and
for the center on my lid I want to use
this shade down here at the very last
one on the last row and I'm going to use
a sigma short shader brush this is an e
20 I did spray it with a little bit of
fix+ whoo
give it more of the metallic vibe oh
that's really pretty looks like a penny
oh well like that
so for the middle shade I'm just packing
this all along the center of the lid and
again another like really small brush I
used to do this one with you know my big
shader brush is like the e55 from Sigma
no to big things small thinks small when
you're doing a halo eye so I'm just
taking a clean brush this is the Sigma
e-40 for I'm just gonna sweep it back
and forth and see how I like it
sometimes I add a crease shade after I
put the first shadows down sometimes I
don't but I think I actually am so I'm
just gonna use the same brush here and
I'm gonna grab the second color and the
last drill so really what just worked
with the last row so far but I'm gonna
grab just a little bit of that second
color not too much I'm just going to
blend that into the crease this is where
I come back and look because sometimes
that some of the shadows can fade so
like I feel with the inner corner isn't
as bright as it was so I'm just gonna
come back with that first shade and
reapply and then I'm gonna do just a
little bit on the outer corner as well
to make sure the shade out here didn't
get blended away also so that's another
thing with halo eyes that I noticed
pretty simple because I mean I've only
used three shades you really only need
to use two so it's pretty simple that
way but after blending sometimes you
just need to take your time and come
back and build up any any colors that
kind of get lost along the way
there is done I'm going to move on into
my face before my primer this is like
this is my og primer oh my goodness this
is from Too Faced this is their primed
and poreless primer it's a skin
smoothing face primer this I think was
one of my very first just face primers
in general that I ever bought but you
guys heard me say that two-face was like
my original not only high-end brand but
one of the first makeup brands that I
started purchasing from on a consistent
base
and the primed and poreless I've gone
through so many of these and like this
one didn't work out for my sister the
bus so she gave it to me because she
knew how much I loved it so it's just so
funny but it makes me even more sad that
I just don't really love to face as much
these days and sometimes when I say I
don't love to face people get confused
when I use their products and I get it
but all I'm saying is that I'm not
currently buying from them it takes a
lot for me to like completely boycott a
brand or something like that because I
don't know I think I'm a pretty
laid-back chill person so it really does
take a lot for me and there's still a
lot of like the og products from Too
Faced that I really enjoy like the
chocolate Soleil bronzer the Too Faced
better than sex mascara things like that
and that I still really do like but you
had the primed and poreless this was
this was like my original man I should
probably get rid of this it has to be
really old in a boy foundation this is
one of the first foundations that I had
really really strong feelings for this
is my L'Oreal True Match Lumi look how
used that is oh my goodness and it's
almost gone like I mean it is it is
almost gone feel like I've been using
this a lot more lately because I want to
use it up I've my foundation collection
that's really expanded as I've recently
started getting into trying at new
foundations so I want to use them up I
just I even though I know I'm close I
just don't want to just throw it away
with product left because I love this
foundation so much I am using a sigma
angled kabuki as the f80 for I feel like
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi was like if
you go back and watch my videos even
from like last year or something like
you're gonna see that foundation
mentioned a lot because I mean we formed
a pretty serious relationship very
quickly very quickly concealer I'm going
to use another mmm-hmm concealer you
know what I'm saying
this is the Maybelline fit me I don't
know how many Maybelline fit me as I've
gone through but this was one of the
first concealers that I bought off of
YouTube recommendations and I was like
oh my gosh those youtubers really know
what they're talking about I actually
almost
this completely used up so I've been
using this one a lot more to can feature
it in an upcoming empties video one of
these days you'll get an empties video
post it so I'm just going to apply this
to my undereyes and I didn't do any
liner so I'm just gonna kind of use the
concealer to clean up the shadows as
well then I'm gonna put this on the
middle of my face you use my trusted
Sephora 57 brush to blend it out my
absolute favorite concealer brushes like
I said I'm gonna use the concealer to
just kind of clean up the end of the
shadows right here I don't need like up
kind of line but you know just to make
it look a little on the cleaner side
when I was going through my collection
and fighting items to pull out I found
this one and I was like why have I not
reached for this in so long this used to
be an absolute favorite of mine this is
the wet'n wild mica glow contouring
palette - indulge a de leche I love this
palette so much and I'm frustrated with
myself that it's been so long since I've
reached short I love both sides of this
palette they studying powder and the
contour powder I actually had one before
this one and I broke it when I was
traveling I was so devastated I had to
go out and buy another one
I mean it's went well so it's super
affordable of course but I was like wait
a second that's why I'm like so excited
to do more of these videos I really
really like I'm so excited that Nicole
said that she would clap with me on this
first one because you know kind of
kicking off incorporating more flashback
videos onto my channel and I'm just so
excited to do it with her because she's
one who got me super excited like every
time I see her post a flashback video I
get excited to see what pellets she's
using among other products that she's
using so I'm just I'm really so excited
I hope if you guys are not yet
subscribed to her that you will go check
her out I actually asked for channel
recommendations a couple months back and
a lot of you guys that suggested her
Channel and that is how I found her so
thank you I always appreciate new
channel suggestions I think it's awesome
I'm using the marque 49 to set the
concealer so really big thank you to
that so I know a lot of you already are
subscribed to her but in case you are
not yet definitely suggest that you had
over
to her channel and then I just kind of
used what's left over on the brush to
tap the center of my face but yeah I'm
so excited I had a lot of fun going
through my collection and finding items
and I'm like wait a second why didn't I
use this one and so on so this is a fun
video for me and I'm gonna grab my Sigma
F oh six brush and I'm gonna use this
brush and the other side of the wet and
wild palette to do some contour I like
this brush for contour cuz I feel like
it gets like right up in there under the
cheekbone for bronzer I did mention this
one earlier but this is the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer I just really
enjoy it so all these years later I
still really enjoyed this all a bronzer
and this is the sigma f30 brush I've
been really enjoying this for bronzer so
I'm just going to lightly bronze up the
skins and then for blush we're taking it
back to a wet and wild again and this is
the wet and wild color icon ombre blush
this one is in the shade of might I buy
you a drink
I must so obsessed so obsessed with this
blush when I first got it oh it's just
so pretty it's like I mean it's Umbra it
has it in the in its name but it's like
a really cool peachy blush it has some
beautiful shimmer to it this is the luxe
II a 504 angled brush so I'm just going
to apply and I remember I used to love
this blush so much too because it has
the shimmer in it
I was like oh it's kind of like having
that highlight at the same time because
I didn't understand the highlight ran
for like a while and now I'm like oh
see you see that like this look I
really did like this blush and I feel
like it got a lot of attention too like
a lot of people were chatting about this
which is probably why I bought it I mean
I bought so much off YouTube
recommendations back in the day because
I had no idea how to like shop for
makeup I mean apply makeup you know I
had no idea about any of it YouTube
legitimately taught me everything
everything I learned she was from
YouTube so before I finish off the eyes
I am going in to do my brows off-camera
I don't really have a throwback brow
product which might not be shocking if
you guys have been following
for a while so I'm gonna do my brows
off-camera and then I'll come back to
finish off the eyes so I did my brows
off-camera I actually did like the
opposite of this video and I used a
newer product to me so I don't I don't
know I feel I can't hit them very large
but who the crowd I benefit it's a
little intimidating to me right now and
I did add a little bit of color pop and
kathleenlights mr. Bing a liner to my
waterline so then I'm just gonna come
back in it to finish off the eyes I'm
gonna grab that first orange shade that
we used and this is the morphe 43 it's
just a flat definer brush and I'm going
to push that shade really close to the
lower lash line then I'm going to pick
up this shade that we used or to blend
which is the second one this is a morphe
m50 6 then i'm going to go through and
sweep that on the lower lash line I'm
gonna grab the second shade in the
palette with my morphe 36 time I used
this for a inner corner and then also a
brow bone highlight I'm not going to do
lashes I don't feel like I have a lot of
like thrilled that pairs of lashes I
mean you do go through your lashes
pretty quickly and I know that I wear
lashes a lot of scishow to balance it
out every once in a while but choosing a
mascara was also really hard and
mascaras are something that you do need
to you know toss fairly quickly lay
expire quickly so I go through mascaras
a lot but I found this one and I was
like I used to love the Smashbox x-rated
mascara I know this is made it into a
favorites video at some point but to a
finish off of the face of course I'm
gonna throw it all the way back to my
very first highlighter which is the mary
lou manizer from the balm I recently did
my highlight declutter and I mentioned
in there that this was the very first
highlighter that I ever purchased and it
was like astounding to me the number of
people that said this was their first
highlighter as well I was like wait what
what what are the chances here that was
so funny
I'm gonna use my Sigma fo3 highlighter
to woah to highlight
so I thought that was so funny so I
would love to know what your first
highlighter was and how many more people
was first highlighter was the American
manizer from the balm I thought it was
funny because someone commented in there
and said you know my first was the mary
lou manizer - i think she was the first
for many people she really got around
and I was like mary loumanizer not a
little thing I did not know that about
you
zinc was definitely a hard choice I
actually pulled out a few different
options and I said I would decide at the
end and then I still had a hard choice
but I'm gonna throw it back to a color
pop lipstick I've had some ups and downs
with the color couple of sticks
I've talked about them in the past about
how I feel like they have a pretty short
shelf life and how they can go bad a lot
quicker then maybe I expect it but
they're pop lipsticks you know the ultra
matte and then the ultra satin scepter
they came out with them these are really
some of my favorites and I felt like I
was really starting to able to
experiment with more colors with liquid
lipsticks when colour-pop released their
alter mattes because they were so
affordable I was buying you know some
shades outside of my comfort zone and
things like that so even though they're
not my favorite right now I thought it
would be fun to throw it back to it so
this is an ultra satin lip and
screenshot this shade isn't necessarily
like my oldest shade at all I did
declare quite a few of my older color
pop lipsticks when I did my most recent
lipstick declutter because I think that
they go bad but this isn't like super
new to me so I thought that we could
still make it work if the lips are
complete I'm gonna spray my face with
some of the Mario Badescu official rose
water spray this is one of my first
sprays because it was so hyped up here
on YouTube I still really do enjoy it so
I'm gonna go ahead and spray my face
with this okay so this is the final look
for my first a flashback Friday video I
really hope that you guys enjoyed the
video and seeing some of my flashback
projects and the look that I created
like I said I hope that you will go over
to Nicole's channel check out her video
subscribe tell her I sent you when all
of that fun stuff is really excited that
I should collaborate with me on this
video and I hope to be able to do some
more flashback Friday videos I'm not a
tutorial based Channel and I only do a
tutorial type of videos once a week and
those are
Friday is the summers that well from
flashback Fridays but because I only do
one tutorial type of video a week I'm
not sure how often I'll be able to do a
flashback video like Nicole doesn't
almost every single Friday which i think
is awesome so I will just have to
incorporate them in here and there where
I can but if you guys want to see more
