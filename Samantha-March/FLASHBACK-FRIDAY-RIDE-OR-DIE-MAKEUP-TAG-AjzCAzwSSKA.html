today's video is going to be a new a
flashback Friday a style video I got a
requesting to do a flashback Friday to
my ride-or-die tag video that I did I
looked it up my ride-or-die tag which
was started by Jacqueline Hill I posted
this in August of 2016 which is pretty
crazy so I revisited that video I looked
over all of my absolute Ryder diet
makeup items and then I was just loving
at that point of time and I'm gonna pull
them all back out and let you know what
I think of them where they now are they
still in my collection and they still a
favorite so if you are ready for this
new a flashback Friday video why don't I
go ahead and get started ready so first
up the foundation that I featured in
that video was the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi a foundation I love this foundation
so much I recently ran out of it I used
up my entire bottle and I'm very sad
about that and I definitely do want to
repurchase it every time that I go to
the drugstore I swear that I forget that
I want to pick up a new bottle even
though I definitely have a ton of
foundations right now and I don't
necessarily need to add another one to
my collection I just want it in there
because it's one of my favorites I know
I just got another coupon to CVS and I
need to remember that because I really
do want to go pick up on another one of
that I've mentioned it in favourites
videos so many times writer dive videos
I think like my safety net makeup tag
video and all of that and just recently
used it up and will definitely be
repurchasing it it's one of my faves and
it's so L'Oreal it's drugstore you can
use coupons which is fantastic so that's
great the concealer that I mentioned in
there is also one that I recently ran
out of it's the Maybelline fit me
concealer I have gone through so many of
the Maybelline fit me concealer and I
just recently went through my last one
as well again it's just one of my
favorite concealers I will plan on
repurchasing this one as well
Maybelline drugstore a little bit more
affordable can use coupons all of that
great stuff and it's just one of those
that I enjoy having in my collection
because I just feel like it always looks
really nice on the under eyes it's easy
to blend out even since before I started
a youtube channel it's been a favorite
of mine so that still holds true as well
another one that still holds true is the
powder that I mentioned this is the pure
four-in-one pressed mineral powder I
have
buying this powder since my college days
which was they look at they are well in
the past I can't I really can I see them
but no they're back there I love this
powder I recently did declutter one of
them in my face powder declutter video
because it had been open for a very long
time and had a huge dent in it and I
still wanted to keep this fresh new one
though because I love this powder so
much I've been using it forever and I
think it's fantastic
still definitely on my list let's see
next up I mentioned the Rimmel
translucent powder i did just declare
this one in my face powders mostly
because I had had it for like years and
years and years but I also broke the cap
to it so it was always just kind of like
sitting awkwardly there because I didn't
want to like have anything else digging
into it and type of thing so I ended up
getting rid of it but I was like yeah
I'm gonna repurchase this one it's like
two dollars or something maybe three
dollars it's super affordable and it's
just one of those honestly like
ride-or-die powders for me again
something that i started purchasing
before my youtube days it's just
something that I've always had my
collection with me and I said in my
declutter video that I was absolutely
shocked that I didn't hit pan on that
thing because I used it so often I'm
very light handed with my makeup though
so it's always really challenging for me
to hit pan but that one was one that I
truly was surprised but still loved that
one and I do want to repurchase it I
also had on there the Milani Luminoso
blush so this is the Milani baked a
powder brush top blush you know blush
brush the same thing feel like I just
said that in a prior video this is the
blush and this was definitely like a
YouTube made me buy it's a type of blush
everybody always raved about Luminoso I
recently did my blush declutter and I
had two Milani blushes I decluttered one
but I kept this one because I do I love
the color it's really beautiful peachy
has a bit of like shimmer to it
especially in the spring summer and when
I have a little bit more of a tan I feel
like it looks absolutely gorgeous on the
face so still definitely a favorite of
mine the bronzer that I mentioned did I
pull it out here the bronzer that I
mentioned it's from a two-faced and this
is the chocolate Soleil bronzer again it
was kind of similar to the pure powder
that I mentioned I had two of these but
the one that I had
I'd had it for a while it was also a
deluxe sized sample like this one is and
the box was just like all kinds of junky
so I declared that one but I was like I
do want to keep like my new fresh one
because I do really enjoy this bronzer I
kind of bronzer that like one of my
first high-end bronzers I think that I
ever really purchased was this one from
Too Faced and I really do enjoy it so I
have a fresh new one over here and I
would still consider it a favorite
bronzer of mine the highlight that I
mentioned is from Becca and Jaclyn hill
and it is champagne pop I can't remember
if I mentioned the single in that video
I used to have the single of the
champagne pop but it did shatter pretty
badly and I just I I couldn't revive it
but the face palette that I have the
champagne glow face palette does have a
champagne pop champagne pop in here also
Prosecco pop and some blushes I love
this guy I recently did my favorite face
pallets video and I forgot to mention
this one and I was like no this is one
of my favorites still love this palette
still love champagne pop I still reach
in and grab for it it's an older release
but still one of my favorites for sure
I'm mascara that I mentioned is the
Maybelline lash sensational mascara I
went through quite a few tubes with that
mascara I always thought it was really
nice and especially affordable for
Maybelline I haven't repurchased it
since but I do have on my lashes today
I'm not wearing falsies but I do have
the Maybelline total temptation mascara
on I've been wearing at the past couple
days early do enjoy it I like wearing
the false lashes but I like this one it
kind of makes your lashes like just a
little bit on the fluffy side I feel
like the lash sensational does more for
length than it did for volume or is this
new one a smart volume versus length but
Maybelline I feel like just has a lot of
good mascaras I feel like so I do still
enjoy that one I don't know if I would
repurchase it right now especially
because my mascara collection is like I
have a very large one and mascara so
something I try not to have a ton of
because they go bad very quickly but
that was still a really good mascara and
I think it's really similar to the
benefit roller lash I believe it's the
one that is similar to I think it's a
from Maybelline i mentioned the regular
lipsticks i love maybelline lipsticks i
have been recommending them for ever
but buying them forever I used to have a
huge collection at one point and it was
crazy I was actually just wearing
truffle tees in a previous video I think
is my beauty unboxing video and I have
on the shade peach buff today and with a
lip gloss on top and I really like the
Maybelline lipsticks if you like just a
regular lipstick you know maybe you're
not a liquid lipstick lover and whatnot
I would check out the ones from
Maybelline they're affordable
they have different lines in there you
know they have the creamy lipsticks they
have lipsticks with a matte finish and I
just think that they're really good I
still would consider them an absolute
favorites what lipstick that I mentioned
is from Kat Von D this was kind of
interesting to see I was like wow Kat
Fondy was my ride-or-die because I still
really enjoy Kat Von D you don't get me
wrong I still continue to buy her
everlasting liquid lipsticks but I don't
know if I would say out of my entire
liquid lipstick collection now which
definitely has grown since August 2016
don't get me wrong it's definitely grown
but I just thought it was really
interesting that this was the one that I
chose but I do I really enjoyed the Kat
Von D liquid lipsticks and I totally
should have put these in makeup I love
that it seems like everyone else hates
because I feel like I always have really
negative things about the Kat Von D
lipsticks a lot of people say that
they're super drying and what I
definitely feel like they're more on the
dry side but sometimes I've always
thought about look at lipsticks that I
don't necessarily mind it as long as
it's not like uncomfortable or like
crumbles weird on me I can get down with
it because I like having it on and like
having it stay put the entire time so I
really do like these but bow-and-arrow
definitely is one of my absolute
favorite shades I do love the shades so
much but I just thought I don't know I
thought that was interesting to see that
kind of give me a surprise I was like I
do not remember choosing that one in my
ride-or-die video still a favorite still
favorite don't get me wrong I also
mentioned in there the colour-pop ultra
satin at liquid lipstick formula I don't
think I mentioned like one specific fave
like I did with the Kat Von D I just
kind of mentioned the ultra satin in
general I only have three at this time I
think these are like six dollars on the
colour-pop website I've talked in the
past that the colour-pop ultra matte I
feel like don't have a very good shelf
life and they go bad very quickly the
altar sentence I feel like are kind of
similar but the altar mats are like way
like they go bad super super fast the
altar sentence I feel like take a little
bit longer of a
and I like the alter sat in a formula
more I would say than the altar mats I
liked with ultra mat straight down
completely and they really like our not
transfer proof or the ultra sadness take
a while and sometimes with certain ones
you can kind of get a little bit of
transfer here at there nothing like
super bad but I definitely still do
notice it but they are more comfortable
on the lips as well and I don't get that
they go bad as quickly so if you are
wanting to try a color pop liquid
lipstick formula I would suggest the
satin line for sure but I would not
consider these a ride-or-die anymore
because I just don't feel like they last
long enough and I feel like I have
others in my collection that I enjoy
more the lashes that I mentioned in
there were from ardell they were the
Ardell whispies I have talked about
these in the past too that our delta is
just no longer my favorite lash brand
which is like shocking to me it was one
of those things where I think that our
del was one of the first lash Frantz
that I really ever started trying way
before YouTube I have always worn lashes
I've always been obsessed with having
fake lashes on I mean all the way like
back in college didn't even know how to
apply them always did like a junky job
doing it but I didn't care I just want
it lashes and our del was always what I
went for because they were so affordable
college student you need an affordable
lashes for sure and I think it was kind
of one of those things that once I
started trying other brands and seeing
other lashes I was like oh ho I don't
think that these are the best
bomb-diggity around so that was it was
such a bummer to realize that because I
loved them so much I still do recommend
them for like trying out lashes if
you're trying to learn how to apply them
or even seeing like what style of lash
fits you the best are you more dramatic
are you natural are you long are like
you know whatever it may be
it's still really nice because they are
affordable men it seems like mother B at
CBS or Ulta or whatever you can buy the
are doll lashes there always seems to be
some sort of special like buy one get
one free buy one get one half off you
know things like that so it's nice to be
able to practice with them but they're
definitely like I can't remember the
last time I wore our doll lashes which
is crazy the eyeshadow pellet that I
mentioned in there was a from morphe and
this is the 3/5 of the original 3/5 Oh I
shadow palette and
but this one looks like I would not
consider this one my ride-or-die anymore
more if you did come out with a 3/5 L to
which I love even more it's definitely
just an oomph up from the original 3/5
oh so I want to consider this one a
ride-or-die anymore but I definitely
loved it and I definitely got so much
use this palette and I think I paid like
$20 for it so like I feel like I
definitely got my $20 worth of this
palette I enjoyed the 3 500 - even more
but the Jacqueline hell morphe palette
was like one of the standout palettes
for me as of recently but I feel like
there's also other eye shadow palettes
that I enjoy a lot too I still do like
the morphe eyeshadows and I do enjoy
their palettes but definitely for the
3/5 oh I won't consider it a ride-or-die
anymore and if you try if you're trying
to decide between 3 500 and the 3 500 -
I would definitely recommend the 3 502
and I just feel like the formula is
better and the colors are more like
pigmented and intense and that one but
that was fun to see I wasn't sure I
could remember what I should have
palette I mentioned either I was like
huh the 3 and again my eyeshadow palette
has greatly expanded from August of 2016
who who's been here who's been here for
a while remember when you see her me say
I'm not an eyeshadow palette junkie
where's your hand bridge and if you've
been around for that long
the liner's that I mentioned are
mentioned two different liners one is
from a color pop these are their gel
pencil liners I fell like madly deeply
in love with the color pop at gel pencil
liners and they're like $5 they are
super pigmented they go on the waterline
so well and they stay like these are one
of the liners that I have to like pull
my eyelid down and like run my makeup
wipe over my waterline to get them off
because they just stay around forever
now I thought I heard someone say that
these are either being discontinued or
they're not making new ones or something
like that does anybody know if that's
actually true cuz that's really sad if
it is because these are really fantastic
affordable liners and that would make me
really sad if that was the case another
liner that I mentioned I mentioned three
liners well I do love eyeliner I wear
eyeliner everyday eyeliner is one of
those things for me that like I have to
wear it if I'm leaving my house not
necessarily like a winged eyeliner but
in my waterline I have to have eyeliner
but another one that I mentioned is the
Maybelline master precise eyeliner and I
feel like I'm
this recently in another flashback video
because it was in a favorites video and
I said that I just ended up not loving
it I'm not sure if maybe something
happened where I got like a bad pencil
because I remember I repurchase it
because I loved it so much and when I
repurchased it the second pencil I
didn't feel like was anything like the
first like not as pigments it barely
showed up though I'm pretty sure I ended
up decluttering that one which was a
bummer and I haven't repurchased since
so I don't know if that was just like a
weird one-off thing or like what
happened there but there's definitely a
lot of other eyeliners I'm looking at
them right now I got a big big basket of
eyeliners and there's definitely other
ones that I like more than the
Maybelline one the a final liner and the
final product that I mentioned in that
video was from Sigma and this is the
wicked gel liner I really do enjoy this
liner I will say that I don't wear gel
liners as much as I did especially I
feel like back in 2016
even when I just in general first
started at YouTube channel I wore gel
eyeliners a ton Maybelline Sigma I think
I used the morphe one maybe like a
L'Oreal one I went for gel liners a ton
and now I barely barely reach for them
so I wouldn't necessarily consider this
a ride-or-die anymore just because I
don't wear that style of liner as much I
just go for pens or like the regular
liquid liners and things like that but I
remember how much use I got of this guy
and it probably just needs to be
declutter cuz it's pretty much gone I've
hit pan on it and it's just it's it's
it's been through the mill but I do
remember how much I loved this one super
black and I thought it was really easy
to work with
that was funny to see and I was like oh
my gosh I remember how many gel liner
pots I would go through like whenever I
was traveling I would have to remember
to bring my gel liner and then also burn
my brush with me at the same time
because you don't want to forget that
because how even put your liner on if
you don't have a brush so that was kind
of funny to look back on I definitely
remember my chill liner days so but yeah
after that liner that is going to do it
for my flashback Friday for my
ride-or-die makeup tag so that is
everything a for my latest flashback
