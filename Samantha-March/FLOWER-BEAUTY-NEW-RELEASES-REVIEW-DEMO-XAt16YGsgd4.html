today's video I'm going to be sharing a
review and demo of some new products
from a flower beauty this video is going
to be sponsored by flower beauty I have
worked with them in the past and flower
beauty is definitely one of my favorite
brands out there so I was really excited
when they asked if I would like it to
team up with them for a new video I have
three different projects that I'm going
to be sharing about I'm going to be
reviewing each of them and then also
inserting a double of me actually
applying them I do have those products
on my face right now so I'm really
excited to be doing this in a big thank
you to flower beauty for working with me
again and thank you so much to you guys
at first supporting me I really
appreciate it especially at this moment
in time I appreciate all the support is
so much so if you're interested in
seeing some new products and my reviews
from flower beauty why don't we go ahead
and get started
alrighty so first up I want to talk
about these primers and honestly I think
this is going to be my favorite product
that I am talking about from the three
items that I'm mentioning it today so
there are three new primers here from
flower beauty and these are 13 dollars
each and you do get at one ounce of
product and this is what the packaging
looks like I will also insert some
close-ups as well one that I put on in
the demo and the one that I have been
using the most and gravitating towards
the most is the hydrating primer right
now I am very dry our weather here in
the Midwest has been super cold and very
dry and my skin is definitely feeling
the effects of that so I've been trying
to do anything with the word hydrating
I'm immediately just drawn to it so when
I saw the hydrating primer I knew that
one was going to be for me but there is
also a pore minimizing primer which I do
think is really nice as well and I have
some larger pores especially over here
in this area and I find that this is
really good to fill those in and there
is also the illuminating primer so that
that is something that you tend to
gravitate towards this would be a good
one for you so my preference for the
three primers would definitely right now
first be the hydrating and then the pore
minimizing and then the illuminating but
I have tried out all three primers and
again the one that I inserted into the
demo here is going to be the hydrating
primer so this one is my favorite from
the three products that I'm going to be
talking about and it's because it just
simply works it does what it says it's
going to do
from the moment that I started to rub it
into my skin the first time that I was
trying it I was like wait a second
wait a second when I was first rubbing
it and actually it almost kind of felt
to me more like a maybe like a
moisturizer type of texture because it
just didn't feel too thick it didn't
feel greasy at all but it also felt very
lightweight at the same time and I just
I really enjoyed the application process
of it and it kind of just felt a little
bit different from a lot of other
primers that I've tried so I immediately
was very intrigued but my skin you could
tell was definitely hydrated after I use
this and when I insert the demo clips I
have it putting me on and then I kind of
try to show close-ups of my skin after
each application for each of the the
products that I'm going to be talking
about so you can see what my skin looks
like and I definitely felt very hydrated
just with the primer on alone and then
after I put on foundation I came back so
I could show you again what it looks
like after the foundation I did not use
a foundation that is a dewy foundation
or or even a mattifying foundation it's
just kind of one of those like
in-between foundations as a foundation
that I chose so you could see how the
primer reacts with a foundation like
that and you could definitely tell that
I still have a glow and that I still
have doing this that my skin is still
very hydrated even with that foundation
on is a primer that I have enjoyed using
with some of my more full coverage even
some of my more mattifying of
foundations because I'm not a huge full
coverage lover and I'm not a big fan of
like a super super matte look I lean
more towards the dewy side but I still
like the finishes or the looks of some
of those other foundations but I always
try to pair it with a really hydrating
primer or like a intense moisturizer
before I do my makeup and this one is
really really good it's funny too
because I was never a big fan of primers
especially when I first started my
channel when I first started getting its
makeup I thought I don't really
understand what they do I don't know
what what effects that they have on the
makeup and lately more and more I've
been finding myself wanting to try more
primers wanting to see which ones are my
favorite and like not forgetting them
when I travel I used to do that as well
or just simply like going right in with
my foundation and now I am consistently
original
primers I've been mentioning them a lot
in like my makeup monthly videos and
favorite sections and things like that
when I'm finding a good one and this is
definitely a fantastic one so again a
flower beauty has three new primers out
there so whatever it is that your skin
needs but if you are like me and if you
are really dry right now and you're
looking for a product to really help
hydrate the skin I would check out the
hydrating primer and again these are 13
dollars and of course everything that
I'm mentioning will be linked down below
but this primer especially I think it's
fantastic the product that I want to
talk about is the miracle matte
translucent finishing a powder it comes
in a package like this here which I
really do I like this packaging I
thought it looked very nice so this is a
setting powder for the face now I will
say that since I've been trying out for
a while I tried it underneath my eyes
and then I also tried it as just a
setting powder for the face and I think
it's better just as like an all-over
face powder that's how to recommend it
to use but you know it's makeup you can
try things different ways so I wanted to
try it that way too but I will say that
I like it best for applying over the
face so inside you have I'll insert some
close-ups as well too but you have this
little powder puff here that is in the
product and that's what I use to apply
it to my face sometimes I will use just
a damp Beauty Blender and apply it over
the skin or sometimes I'll just dip a
brush in and apply it that way as well
but you have a few different options
here to use with this powder like I said
I like to apply it for all over the face
and what I have found this one good for
is if I use a hydrating primer like the
flower Beauty one that I was talking
about and then I use like a luminous or
a dewy type of foundation sometimes it
does get to be a little bit too much and
then it's nice to come in with some sort
of setting powder kind of a bump down if
you're like to do a or if you do get
shiny and so that is when I especially
like to use this one especially in
mostly like my t-zone area a lot of
times like the center of my forehead and
my chin can get just a little bit on the
shiny side sometimes right in here not
too bad but again you can use this to
set it all over your face to really
modify the look or maybe if you're a
little bit on the oily or side and you
look for a good setting powder you could
use this one as well but I especially
like it for my t-zone area I don't mind
the powder puff at all I think it's
really fast and an easy convenient way
so I just
leave it in there sometimes certain
applicators I don't love as much but
this one I've kept in there because I
think it's just fine it to work with the
only thing that I will say about this
one that I don't quite love and that's
kind of my same complaint with just
every sighting powder out there is that
it's just a little bit on the messy side
when you use it you know the setting
powder can kind of get everywhere or fly
up everywhere or get on your clothes or
things like that but that's usually the
case with about any setting powder that
you try out so that's my only downfall
with this one but I will also say that I
have done the flash test on it and all
of that and I did not get any flash back
in any of my photos that I tried this
out with I said I tried it on my under
eyes and then also to set my entire face
and I took several different photos to
see if I would have any flash back with
them and I did not experience that with
this setting powder date miracle matte
translucent finishing powder from flower
beauty is $13 as well I did not say that
yet setting powders aren't what I would
consider like an absolute favorite
must-have of mine but I do like having
them in my collection for times when I
do need to set my face I'm gonna be
wearing my makeup for like a long period
of time and I really want to set
everything in I do like having a good
setting powder to go to and I especially
like that this one it didn't give a
flashback so I do enjoy this one as well
the final product that I want to mention
is a setting spray so there are two new
setting sprays that from a flower beauty
they're called the seal the deal setting
sprays there's a long lasting setting
spray which has a matte finish and
there's also be hydrating a setting
story which has a dewy finish I don't
know you're probably thinking after
everything I said like I especially love
the hydrating one for the dewy finish
and I do like this one and I do think
this one is really good but I actually
tend to find myself reaching for the one
with the matte finish more now let me
explain myself I will say that I have
been using at the flower Beauty primer
quite a bit recently and it is a very
very hydrating like I said then I also
said that I just prefer foundations that
have a dewy or a luminous a type of
finish so those are mostly what I have
in my collection when I combine the two
I am very very dewy and very luminous so
I do not need a dewy finishing spray or
when I have that combination so that is
why I like to reach for the matte wine I
feel like it kind of like counter
balances the steps that I have
in my routines to make sure that I look
hydrated to make sure that I look dewy
and not overly dry but you know at the
same time this is a setting spray and it
doesn't even though it has a matte
finish
it doesn't affect like my dryness it
doesn't make me look more dry or
anything like that it just kind of gives
a nice counterbalance to what the dewy
products that I prefer to use so that is
why I've actually been reaching for the
long-lasting a setting spray with the
matte finish even more but you know
maybe you're someone who was the
opposite of me and you use a mattifying
primer and then i'm mattifying a
foundation and maybe you you know set
your face as well but then at the end
you're like me and I just look a little
- sometimes when it's all matte it can
look a little bit dull or like
one-dimensional on the face and you're
like I just want like a little bit of
something to fit up and to make me look
a little bit glowy or a little bit dewy
then I think that you would like the
hydrating setting spray so that is what
I think that one could be good for but
again like my favorite my favorite out
of the two right now is the one with the
matte finish both of these are going to
be at $13 and like I said everything of
course will be linked down below I also
really enjoy the sprayer on this let me
see if I can show you what it looks like
so it's kind of like your regular spray
nozzle here and I don't know if you'll
even be able to see it on camera because
it is a really really fine mist so every
time that I spray it on my face I don't
have to worry about like you know
sometimes you can get like the big
droplets of the setting sprays on there
it can ruin makeup even I've had that
happening with me before this is super
fine and it just feels really nice and
gentle on the skin so I really do enjoy
the actual spray on this one it does say
right on the back here that it's a
lightweight mist and I absolutely agree
with this one is the setting spray that
I have been reaching for lately so I
really enjoyed these ones as well I
think still the primer would be my
absolute favorite but I also really
enjoy setting sprays I do believe in
them I believe in them you can use it to
before you do your makeup you can do it
in the middle of doing your makeup after
you're doing your makeup I'm a big fan
of a lot of times I do my makeup in the
morning because then I film in
afternoons and if I go somewhere at
night all I feel like I need to do is
take a setting spray out and spray my
face and it just kind of like gives me a
little bit of rejuvenation for my makeup
application so I really also enjoy
setting sprays and
even themself I really enjoy these as
well this would be my second favorite
out of everything that I tried out from
today but I really do like them I like
that you have the two different options
and again like I said these are $13 okay
