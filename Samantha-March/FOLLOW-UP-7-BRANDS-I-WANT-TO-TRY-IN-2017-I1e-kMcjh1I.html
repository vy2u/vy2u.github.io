today's video is going to be a follow up
from a video I did about 7 months ago it
was called 7 brands I want to try in
2017 someone commented and asked if I
would revisit that video and talk about
the brands if I've tried them in 2017 my
thoughts on them so that's exactly what
we're going to be doing I will of course
have that video linked down below if you
want to check out these 7 brands that I
said were on my radar on my list to try
in the year of 2017 so why don't we go
ahead and start chatting about these
brands so the first branded that I had
on my list so that I really wanted to
try was a melt cosmetics I was
particularly interested in trying at
some of the melt stacks they have a
really good reputation I hear a lot
about them a lot of people are using
them I see them at tutorials a lot and I
was really interested in trying them out
for myself now I'm actually a little
uncomfortable talking about why I just
had it had to make a purchase from melt
cosmetics is so far in the year 2017 and
I don't think I will I know we have a
couple months left
I'm 2017 but I don't think I'm going to
make a purchase and the reason why is
because I send an email to melt
cosmetics and it was shortly after I did
that video and I just said you know I'm
a blogger and here's my links and you
know I did this video and you know just
wondering if there's ever a room on your
PR list I mean it was the basic pitch
email that as a blogger I'm sure a lot
of us have sent out to different brands
you know I used to send them out all of
the time especially at the beginning of
this year I was sending them out like
crazy to all these brands that I was
interested in and just pitching myself
and all that fun stuff and when you send
out pitch emails sometimes you get a
response back and they say yes sometimes
you don't get a response back you don't
hear anything sometimes they plate ly
tell you know they don't have enough
room or you know whatever the reason
might be a lot of times I would I would
get a response back like oh we forwarded
to her social media team I did get a
response back from melt and I don't know
if they meant for the wording to be the
way that they had it but it was really
rude and you know I just moved on from
it you know it didn't like make me cry
or you know I've never bad talked to
melt cosmetics or anything like that
I've just never talked about them again
since during the video and getting that
email but it just kind of really turned
me off from making a purchase and again
you know it's an email I don't know if
they meant to come across the way that
they did just really kind of turned me
off from from making a purchase and I
don't think I will in 2017 I'm not
saying like I'm boycotting the brand or
you shouldn't buyer or anything of the
sort
it just kind of rubbed me the wrong way
well kind of the urge to purchase one of
those melt stacks uh kind of rescinded a
little bit so I have not made a purchase
from melt cosmetics maybe in 2018 I'll
I'll feel a little bit better about it
and I'm not trying to say just because a
brand doesn't send me something when I
pitch myself to them means I'm not gonna
purchase from them because that's not
the case because I have emailed a lot of
brands so that's not the case at all a
lot of times I will email and even if
they say no or I don't hear anything
back I'm still happily buying the
products so please don't think that was
the reason it just the wording came
across as very rude and very
condescending and and really caught me
off guard I'm happy that wasn't the
first response that I ever received back
as a blogger because it probably would
have shipped me to like not want to send
any other pitch emails out but that's
what happened that's why I haven't
purchased Rimmel Cosmetics it's kind of
a silly story but it's the truth and
it's why I kind of decided not to make a
purchase from them because it just kind
of broke me the wrong way next up on my
list was a lorac cosmetics and I did
make a purchase from lorac I actually
purchased the brunch palette and I was
really excited about this palette I mean
it didn't end up being like my favorite
palette and I wasn't you know like over
the moon about it but I still thought it
was a really nice palette I know that's
got a lot of mixed feedback and actually
a lot of negative feedback but I quite
liked my palette and I thought it was
really good for a pastel palette I had a
fabulous time reaching for this one
especially in the springtime then I was
so shocked because I did I will i buy a
video and i was talking about the
Pirates of the Caribbean
collection that that lorac was coming
out with and they actually emailed me
and said that they were going to send me
the collection which was wild and
completely unexpected they did send me
their eyeshadow
they're cheap pellet and the lip
products in there too and then I even
more shocking they turned around and
they sent me the beauty in the Beast
collection as well when they came out
with this collection I was like are you
kidding me right now this is crazy so
that was really really awesome I will
say that I thought the eyeshadow
palettes were really good and I don't
have a lot of complaints about the
eyeshadow palettes of a standouts to me
are really the face pallets from these
collections and that I have tried I
think I mentioned both of these in my
favorite limited edition products video
that I did I think they really are very
good the look products I really didn't
like so much I know I think I declutter
a few of them and I passed a few long to
friends as well the lip products just
didn't do much for me but definitely the
cheek pellets had me so excited this is
the one from Pirates of the Caribbean
and it has a lot of really gorgeous
highlighters in here including a blush
and this one I think I like even more it
has three blushes and a gold highlight
in here and I go into this one so often
and this one often comes traveling with
me too next brand that I said that I
wanted to try in 2017 it was a pilot
boss and I'm excited to say that I did
my friend Michelle actually sent me the
Holy Grail eyes shadow palette and I was
so excited when I opened up that package
because I wanted to try this palette so
bad I really wanted to turn the violet
box i shadow palettes because I was
hearing so much great things about them
and when I opened it up I was like this
is just this is just my kind of pellet
this this palette is for me and I'm so
excited to say that this really turned
into one of my favorite eyeshadow
palette I continually reach into this
guy I really enjoy the mattes
I love and a matte brown smokey eye it's
what I go for so often and a lot of
times I'm reaching into this palette
because there's a lot of Browns in here
but there's a lot of different shades of
Browns and I recently did an Instagram
tutorial with this palette and you see
me take a brown from each row and then
blend them all together to create that
Brown smoky eye and it's just one of my
absolute favorite looks so I love this
palette for it I love this orange over
here it's called hashtag about I'll flip
the palette around so it looks so it
looks normal but I love the shade
hashtag and I find a reason to use it
every single time even when I do a brown
smokey eye I come in and take hashtag
and blend it all together why I don't
know I always need that orange though
the shimmers are also
beautiful I'm here and I love the big
mirror I will definitely be trying more
at by Lafosse eyeshadow palette for
short I have been so impressed with this
one so I would highly recommend violet
bas if you're looking for a good
eyeshadow palette this one really got me
but next time I said that I wanted to
try Koko lashes I am a huge fan of
lashes I'm not wearing to them today
which is a little strange I did do a
flashback Friday video which would have
been posted on Friday I'll link it down
below but that's where I do with this
makeup look in case you are interested
in seeing how I got it
I will go ahead and leave that linked if
you want to check it Alex I just love
false lashes I've been wearing false
lashes for years and years before I had
a YouTube channel before I even
understood how to really apply false
lashes I don't care I still wear a noun
because my eyelashes are just so short
and tiny and I just I just love wearing
lashes and so I had my eye on Koko
lashes because lustre looks or at Katie
she's one of my favorite influencers and
she always would tuck up the Queen B
lashes are from Koko lashes so they were
on my list and I was so excited my
friend Kelly sent me a little birthday
package and in there was the Queen B
lashes from Koko lashes and I just
thought no way like that is so cool
there's such a like thank you like
lashes oh my gosh it was so exciting
and so I was super pumped about that and
I wore those lashes to death I do not
have them anymore because I wore them so
often it was like one of those pairs
that we're like disintegrating in my
fingertips because I wore them so much
they were gorgeous I love them I need
more of them I've been seeing other
styles and the Koko lashes that I want
to buy too so I think I'm just when I go
to place my order I mean I definitely
need the Queen B's but I think I'm gonna
try out a couple of the other styles too
because I really enjoyed those they were
easy to apply I enjoyed the band you
know that they lasted a really long time
I mean my birthday was in March and I
just recently got rid of them they might
have actually been in my most recent
like either these are too clutter video
sometimes I'll throw it lashes in my
little garbage can so I can talk about
you know which lashes I'm getting rid of
but I'm go through lashes quite a bit
because of how often I wear them but I
felt like they had a really good lasting
power as well so yeah I would definitely
purchase more Koko lashes the queen bees
are gorgeous if you love full and wispy
lashes I would
I recommend them I almost missed this
brand I was going down the list in the
video and I was counting them I was like
oh my gosh I only did six brands well I
didn't know when tell me this no I just
missed one in the list who so we're
gonna go backwards a little bit from
that video but another brand that I
really wanted to try it was a julius
place and really exciting because i did
get sent the masquerade mini to me from
a subscriber friend which is so exciting
in it I'm really grateful for all these
packages that I do get from subscribers
and the people that I do consider
friends because it just helps me out so
immensely when doing review videos or
even just getting asked I don't know if
people realize how often you know beauty
bloggers or beauty influencers get asked
about comparisons and dupes and formulas
all of those different pieces because I
mean it truly is for me right now it is
a daily basis where I get asked
something about a product and it's
almost a daily basis where I have to say
I don't know I've never tried that it's
impossible for me to buy everything it's
you know impossible for me to get sent
everything and get on every PR list and
get every PR package there is out there
that's not possible
so when I get these packages it is so
incredibly helpful to me I mean I love
being able to play with the makeup and
that's obviously so exciting for me but
it means even more that I can make those
review videos that I can do comparisons
videos and then I can just answer
comments and questions about some of
these products so it means a lot to me
and just thank you to everybody who has
sent me who has sent me anything and it
means a lot to me and you know guys know
I cry a lot but really doesn't mean it
lasts me and it really does help me out
so thank you to everyone who has done
that and even if you've done anything
like sending me a letter and get a lot
of letters and cards in my peel box and
that makes my day I'm working on making
an entire like photo album full of those
because they really do mean a lot to me
but to get back to the video reel it in
get back to the video I have the
masquerade minion pellet from Julia's
place and oh my gosh like people are not
joking around when they say that these
eyeshadows are absolutely incredible
because they
really are don't need any sort of you
know like setting spray or a damp brush
to get these shivers especially to
really pop you don't need that in the
first shapes that I ever came in with
was this green one right here and a lot
of times when I'm trying out an
eyeshadow palette I will not dampen my
brush first because I just want to see
and I remember dipping it into there
putting it on my eyes nubs like how is
this even possible
and then sometimes even when you do that
it looks popping right away but you can
tell throughout the day that it fades
and fades in phase or sometimes it fades
you know by the time you get to undoing
the rest of your makeup your eyelid has
faded and then you do need to dampen
your brush and go back in no not these
these stay on your eyes so long that
they almost kind of stay in my eyelids
and at the end of the night when I go
through and you don't take my makeup off
when I'm wearing this palette I go
through and take my makeup off you know
do my eye makeup like normal and I look
in the mirror and I still have remnants
of eyeshadow on my eyelids and I'm like
what how do I get this off and then I
have to really go in and like in detail
about taking off these eyeshadows
because the lasting power on these is
like something I've never seen at this
palette because it definitely can push
me out of my comfort zone it has these
beautiful Browns you know right in this
section over here has these like really
like the neutral tones obviously look at
all these bright colors in here they are
so fun to play with I love the greens
I love the purples I love the blues I
even love this color right here that one
was so pretty and unique I've gotten so
much joy out of having this palette it's
been really fun to have but it's
definitely made me very impressed with a
dubious place I should've helped I would
not hesitate to recommend their
eyeshadows to anyone and I would
definitely buy some for myself as well
very impressed with this brand I have a
to brands to go this one is setting some
highlighted my feet
changing I've been filming a little bit
later so the next brand that I said I
want to try in 2017 it was that Kevin a
Quan or Kevin a qua Beauty I really
really wanted to try those brand but
they're definitely a luxury like
high-end a luxury brand and prices they
always heard such good things about the
sculpting powder and I
contour and all of that so I was like I
really really want to try it and I found
a duo on the Sephora website it was the
sculpting powder and then I think it was
a blush or highlight I can't remember
now but it was a little duo and it was
only $25 so I was like I'm totally
buying that and right around that time
the VIP sale was coming up so I was
getting everything ready for that VIP
sound I was like getting that duo and
I'm so pumped and then when the vib sale
hit it sold out immediately and I was
like no I was so bummed I was so upset
about it because I really wanted to try
it but then I somehow got a package from
a Kevyn Aucoin which was so so insanely
exciting when the thing about PR
packages that I know I think a lot of
people think like oh you're just excited
that you're getting the free makeup and
all of that it's a much deeper feeling
than just getting something in the mail
just receiving something because I don't
know if you guys know how hyped I am
when I just get an email saying that
they like my work or a comment on an
Instagram photo or even just all like on
an Instagram photo just knowing that
you're catching attention of these
brands that is what really means a lot a
lot more than you know the free makeup
that they send a log but of course it's
a huge part of it and it's a huge part
of being able to expand and grow a
channel got this I got this book which
was so cool and then inside you have a
cream contour and a cream highlight and
then you have the regular powder
sculpting powder and then the candlelit
powder which is a powder highlight and
then you have these eye shadows down
here and I immediately became obsessed
with the sculpting powder that is like
that is like the star of the show and
most recently I also got to be making
faces beauty book and I've mentioned
this in a couple different videos but
inside you have this little magnetic
pull out and then you have these three
different books here I believe the set
is $75 on the Sephora website but when
you open it up so you have the sculpting
powder again and then you
a highlight and then you also have a
bronzer I reach for this so often a lot
of times I don't have the book nicely
put together like how it is now because
I've reach for that contour book so
often and then we also have a blush you
have two blushes up here and then three
eyeshadow shades and then in the third
book is like a full like mini little
eyeshadow palette here which I just
think is so cool also did send me the
concealer
at one point and it doesn't have the
full name on here I know it has a longer
name but I'll have everything linked
down below but this is a really good
concealer a very full coverage concealer
to reach for this one a lot so those are
a couple busting out products from Kevin
Kwan Beauty that I've been so grateful
to receive because it's been really fun
trying out this brand and because they
do have such high prices it's nice to be
able to say what's worth it what's not
worth it and all of that but yeah very
very excited to be able to try that
brand in 2017 then the final brand that
I said I want to try in 2017 was a
Beauty bakery I was interested in quite
a few of their items they have some
eyeshadow palettes I thought were
interesting some of their setting
powders that have made it onto my radar
and that ended up not making a purchase
because you know not only do I enjoy
reviewing makeup it's a big reason why I
started a YouTube channel
I just love reviewing I've been
reviewing products since 2009 on my blog
and I'm also a review junkie i watch
review videos all day long if I'm
interested in a product I'm going to
YouTube first and I'm typing in that
product and I'm watching review videos
because I want to know what I should
spend my money on that's why I take my
reviews so seriously because I really
rely on other people to you know give it
to me straight and tell me what I need
and tell me what I don't need and what's
worth it and what's not worth it so when
I was really interested in Beauty bakery
I was watching all the reviews that were
coming out and they really weren't so
good and you know I was watching a lot
of people that I really trust and I
respect their opinions and a lot you
know there's not not everything was
terrible but it just didn't seem it just
didn't seem like we would be a good fit
and watching the review videos I was
like oh you know what I think I'm gonna
pass over this brand that's why I enjoy
watching the review videos too and I
feel like they're really to help me out
and help me decide where I should
money and where I should save my money
so I ended up not making a purchase but
I would like to know if you guys have
purchased from a beauty bakery what you
would recommend are what you wouldn't
recommend something that I won't in the
future or before 2017 is over but as at
this point I have not yet made a
purchase from a beauty bakery but then
after that those are these seven brands
and then I went to try in 2017 and the
follow up from them okay so so that's
gonna do it for today's video I really
hope that you enjoyed seeing a follow-up
video from the southern France I wanted
to try in 2017 and thank you for the
idea of doing a follow-up video because
I don't know if I would have thought of
that one myself but I was like an idea
if you would like to see any more videos
like this you know like maybe seven more
brands that I want to try before choice
empties over or eight brains I want to
try 2018 that kind of thing please just
let me know in the comments down below I
would love any video suggestions that
you might have for me let me know what
you thought about the brands I've
mentioned a heavy purchase from them
what do you think of them
I hope you not I would love to know and
as always if you guys did enjoyed this
video I hope that you'll give it a
thumbs up I hope that you would also
consider subscribing for you go and I
will see you guys in at tomorrow's video
