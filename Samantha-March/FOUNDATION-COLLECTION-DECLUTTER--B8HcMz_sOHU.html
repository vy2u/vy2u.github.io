today's video we are back with a new
declutter and clearly we're gonna work
on my foundation collection today I feel
like it's gotten a little bit out of
hand recently and I've been waiting to
do this to clutter like I've actually
kind of been looking forward to it
because I know that it's it's time it's
time for this one it's gotten a little
bit out of hand a for me personally so I
need to go ahead and see which ones I
can get rid of so if you are ready for a
new declutter why don't we go ahead and
jump into it so I do have all my
different foundations laid out I also
have items in here like an tinted
moisturizers and as I was saying that on
camera I realized I had a whole another
drawer that has some items like CC
creams BB creams tinted moisturizers and
that so I went ahead and grabbed those
out cuz I do want to focus on these as
well so I'll just go ahead and get
started here so this first one is from
Stila cosmetics it's an illuminating
tinted moisturizer I have had this for
so long I can remember purchasing this
from Ulta and just feeling like
completely BA I thought I was just the
most amazing person because I made a
purchase from the prestige side of Ulta
but I know that that was a very very
long time ago and I can tell that I am
almost out of it like I feel like it's
about right here but other than that
I've had this for at least like three to
four years so I know that I would just
need to get rid of it so I'm going to go
ahead and declutter that one then kind
of the same thing here with this one
from Alma it's the smart shade Smart
Balance and this one is in the shade 300
this is basically what I used to wear as
my foundation on almost a daily basis I
have been purchasing these I mean since
the days that I worked at the hospital I
haven't worked at the hospital for four
years but I can remember this is what I
wore every single morning when I went to
go in to the office so I know I've had
this one for a very long time and again
I can feel that it's almost empty so I'm
gonna go ahead and do clutter that one
this one is the Maybelline Dream afresh
a BB cream this is one that I started
wearing around the time with all May and
I wore this one almost as much as the ah
my number I love this one I went through
quite a few of these as well
but again I've also had this one for a
very long time it's pretty much almost
empty so I'm going to go ahead and
declutter that one too this little guy
is from a cosmetics it's like a deluxe
sized sample of their CC cream and I
really really like this whenever I see
that their samples as Sephora are alta I
will always add on because I really do
like those I do I just need to purchase
the full-size already and get on with it
but I'm gonna keep this one because I
know I still have a few uses left is
from Pier cosmetics it's therefore and
one tinted moisturizer in the shade
medium I just got this one pretty
recently I can't say it was like my
favorite tinted moisturizer blib only
used this a handful of times it's very
new to me
I'm gonna go ahead and keep this one for
right now then we'll go ahead and jump
into the rest of the pile now hopefully
I got a little bit brighter when I
started filming it was a nice and sunny
day and within five minutes of filming
it it decided I didn't want to do that
anymore so that's always interesting
okay so these two are from josie maran
it is the vibrancy argon oil foundation
fluid I got these both in an Ipsy bag
because they came in two different
shades so the shades are are due 45 and
are g-20 I have tried the RG 20 and it
really did not work I kept trying to
make it work because it actually took me
a hot second to realize they sent me two
different shades I thought they just
accidentally sent me two of the same and
so when I pulled out the RJ 20 I just
kept trying this one and I was trying to
make it work and I know that winter is
approaching so my team is going to be
fading but still it was so considerably
light on me so I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter that one and then I'm gonna
keep this one around because this one is
more of my shade and so I want to try it
a few more times so I can get a good
handle on it so I'm gonna keep one in
declutter one so next up this is from
Charlotte Tilbury it's the unisex
healthy glow all year hydrating summer
tint a moisturizer I just got this one
who sent to me pretty recently and I
have not tried it out yet so I'm gonna
go ahead and keep that one this one is
from number 7 it's the city light tinted
moisturizer I tried this one fairly
recently in trying new drugstore makeup
and it did not work well for me and I've
tried it a couple more times since then
and it still I just don't like the way
it looks and feels on me it's just
something about it I'm just not really
loving so I've gave
a couple tries and I just still can't
get on with it so I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter this one so this next one here
is from a covergirl this is the
vitalists healthy elixir and my shade is
in 7:40 I got this one fairly recently
and I really really enjoyed it I think
it's an awesome foundation so I do want
to keep that one and then next up this
is the maybelline superstay better skin
foundation you can see that this is
clearly been so loved and I actually
just ran out of it just a few days ago
and there's still some left in the
bottom here but I'm having a really hard
time getting it out and as I was doing
my makeup the other day I just couldn't
not I got half my face done and I just
could not get any more product to come
out of this so I'm gonna go ahead and
declare this one because it just needs
to be thrown away next up is the L'Oreal
True Match the healthy luminous makeup
foundation this is one of my all-time
favorite foundations I mean you can see
it just like the Maybelline one this one
has been so loved it does have a pump on
it and I've been finding it really hard
like I have to pump away more than I
normally would because it is almost gone
I'm gonna go ahead and declutter it I do
want to purchase a new one a new nice
clean one that I don't have any issues
with pumping it but because it's pretty
much gone I'm just gonna go ahead and
get rid of it because I know I have so
many other foundations to so I'm gonna
go ahead and put that in the eat the
clutter pile and this next one is from
Giovanni this is the photo perfection of
fluid foundation I got this one sent to
me from actally and it turned into a
favorite foundation of mine I know I put
it in my favorite sections in my makeup
monthly and I've just been so impressed
with this one I definitely have to keep
it now this one is from number 7 and
here we go I knew I had to number 7
number 7 did send these to me this is
the stay perfect foundation and I have
the shades cool beige and then also warm
beige and I love them both I will
definitely be keeping them both this is
such a good foundation that is
affordable you can find at the drugstore
you can find it at Ulta like having the
different shades for the different
seasons and I kind of like mix-and-match
them if I need so I'm definitely keeping
both of these some of my favorites the
next one is also this has been a
favorite for such a long time this is
the Clinique beyond perfecting a
foundation and concealer I've read about
this
ever since I've bought it I think it's
fantastic it is a high-end foundation
but it's also only $28 which doesn't
suck compared to what some of the
drugstore prices are these days very
long lasting full coverage foundation
favorites
definitely need to keep that one and
then I have this one from Lancome I have
two of these from Lancome as well these
were sent to me from actally this is the
tenth II doll up to wear foundation and
that my two shades let's see the shades
are back here my shades are in fiscal
and then also bisque warm so again I
like having the two different shades you
can see that one is quite a bit darker
and this is what I've been wearing for
right now which is the bisque form and
then I will probably switch to the cool
come you know what my tan fades and
throughout the fall and winter and such
such a good foundation another one of my
absolute favorites definitely have to
keep these two because I love them this
one is the Tarte rainforest of the sea
foundation again favorite foundation
the only thing I don't like about it is
that has like a dropper form to get out
that's my only gripe with this
foundation I'm in the shade light/medium
honey and I think it's fantastic
definitely do want to keep that one this
one is also one from Charlotte Tilbury
it's brand new it still has like the
plastic on it and everything I'm waiting
to put this in a first impressions
trying high-end makeup video this is the
foundation I'm going to be using so
that's gonna stay in the keep pile
though not doing it too bad so next I'm
going to move on to my stick foundations
this one here is from a flower beauty
and is in the shade sf3 I think is what
the shade is called this one is just way
too light on me like I don't know if
this shade would ever quite work for me
and it just wasn't my favorite
foundation I give it a couple tries but
especially because of the shade matching
I'm gonna go ahead and declutter this
one the next one I have is from
hourglass and this is the vanish stick
foundation this is one of my favorite
foundations definitely one of my
favorite stick foundations I think it is
awesome I bought this one I think it's
during the vib sale the shade is a nude
because it is you know its hourglass so
it is a bit more expensive so I'm pretty
sure I bought it in the vib sale but I
love this
it's full coverage and I reach for this
quite a bit so I'm going to keep that
one this next one is from Tarte
cosmetics this is their clay stick
foundation in my shade isn't light
medium neutral again that the shade
match is not the best for me at all but
I actually ended up not really enjoying
this foundation I I gave it a couple
tries and I ended up not disliking it as
much as I did the first few times that I
tried it out but I just it's just not a
favorite I don't really think it does
anything super flattering for my skin I
didn't enjoy how light the coverage was
just not a favorite so I'll go ahead and
declutter that one and then this one is
the Anastasia Beverly Hills stick
foundation this shade I'm in is also in
natural and it's already up and ready to
go apparently I'm ready to use this one
sorry it keeps my night focus on the
other foundations but I do really like
this one this was another one when I
first got it I wasn't super into it and
over time I changed my mind and I
actually do reach for this one quite a
bit so I am going to keep this one also
and then moving on I have this here from
Nick so this was their total control
drop foundation this was another one
that I kind of went back and forth on
but I do quite like it the only thing
that I don't love is this the dropper
part you know it kind of reminds me of
the Tarte one I just sometimes feel like
I'm either doing too much or I'm doing
too little and it's just that part's not
my favorite but I do like this one do
reach for it still so I will go ahead
and keep that one next one I have here
is from L'Oreal this is the infallible
Pro glow foundation and the shade 207's
sand beige I also like this one quite a
bit it feels very light I didn't realize
I was giving as far down as I was until
I just picked it up right now but I'm
gonna keep it I'm gonna keep using it
until I completely run out of it because
I do really like this foundation and the
next one I have is from up here this is
the Barrett all I did not love this one
which is a big bummer for me because I
really enjoy pure cosmetics but this
foundation I just thought was like very
thick hard to blend the color March
actually isn't great for me as well and
I just didn't think it's that very well
on my skin so I'm going to go ahead and
declutter that one next up I have one
from Urban Decay this is the Naked skin
a one and done this stuff was
a game changer for me this has been in a
favorites video I really enjoyed this
one the shade I have I think is in
medium yea medium I love this I'm
definitely keeping this one because I've
been using it so often it almost always
comes travelling with me I have to hear
from a makeup forever one will send to
me from making it forever and one listen
to me by influencer they aren't in
different shades I have a y3 25 and then
also are three three zero I believe it
is this is a really really good
foundation I know a lot of people had
always hyped this up it's the ultra HD
foundation if I didn't say I know this
one has always gotten a lot of hype and
I'm really excited especially to have
the two different shades kind of my you
know Tanner skin shade and not quite so
tan so I'm going to keep both of these
because I really do like those this one
is from Rimmel this is the clean a
finish of Foundation and the shade is in
nude I got this one from my friend and
make you a trail because she said that
she really enjoyed it and so far I've
really been liking it I've only tried it
a handful of times the shade is just a
little too light for me right now but
not too late that it's never going to
work once my summer tan fades I think
this one would be a really good match
for me so I'm going to keep that one
this one is the oh here we go
this is the estee lauder double wear
nude water fresh foundation I just
mentioned this one in my high
maintenance
makeup and we just did not we can't get
along super well I don't know man it did
come with a pump I had a subscriber sent
me a pump which is really nice I feel
like it's so liquidy that I typically
always make a huge mess whenever I wear
this one and I don't feel like I love
the finish that it gives my skin I'm
honestly I'm kind of upset with myself
that I didn't return it I should have
returned it to Ulta my receipts long
gone and you know I have to pump now
instead of the cap I threw the cap away
because it doesn't fit over the pump but
I really wanted to like it because I
know this is such a loved foundation but
honestly I think that I should declutter
it because I feel like I get upset with
myself every time I use it and I make a
mess and it takes me so much longer to
blend everything out so it's not streaky
on my skin so
I think I'm gonna declutter it I just I
feel like I get angry every time I use
it which that's not good this one is
from gorgeous cosmetics it's the base
perfect liquid foundation I didn't
really like the way this looked on my
skin it pulled very yellow on me and it
did not look the best I wasn't quite
super fond of the finish either but the
the color matching was just really bad
and I felt like it was kind of like that
heavier foundation on your skin or you
know you feel like you're wearing a lot
of makeup so I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter that one and I have this one
from Urban Decay this listened to me
from actally it's the all nighter
foundation and I've been having a great
time testing this one out I'm gonna keep
it because it's fairly newer to me and I
haven't even gave like my review yet so
this one will be sticking around but I
like it so far this one is from
Charlotte Tilbury it is the light Wonder
youth boosting perfect skin foundation
this was the first one when I got the PR
package from Charlotte Tilbury I reached
into this one first and I'm really not
even sure why this was the one I chose
first but I really really like this I
love the way it makes my skin look it's
very like natural-looking but with a
boost and gives you a bit of a healthy
glow like I have been reaching for this
one so much I definitely want to keep
this one I've been having a blast trying
that out of course this one is obviously
new it's still in the packaging and
everything Miki sent this to me as well
and I am planning to use it this week
for a video that is coming very soon
which I'm very excited about this is the
elf a flawless finish foundation and she
got me the shade and sand she does have
a YouTube channel I will go ahead and
link it down below and I say I'm gonna
go ahead and keep that one because duh
and then this final one here is the la
girl pro coverage HD high definition
foundation this one was sent to me from
my friend Candace I have not had a
chance to try it out yet I just got it
pretty recently but I'm excited to try
it out because I feel like I hear good
things about this one too so obviously
this one's gonna go on my keep pile
because I gotta keep it around gotta try
it out okay so here is the final result
we have the declutter pile over here
I'm decluttering 12 foundations and then
these are all of the foundations that
I'm keeping so I am keeping 25 so not
too bad you know of course I have some
of my Holy Grails in here and some of my
favorites I do enjoy having different
shades because it does help out you know
throughout the seasons and that sort of
thing and there's also quite a few
products in the keep pile as well that I
still need to try out and all of that
but I'm pretty happy with what what I
did here today I feel like it's going to
help me and kind of reorganize how I had
my foundations set up in all of that
because I don't have the most storage
for foundations so I feel like being
able to declutter the twelve here will
free up some space so I can do a little
bit better on my organizationÃ­s so I am
happy with this I hope that you guys
enjoyed seeing a third declutter they'll
have quite a few to do so stay on the
lookout I'm doing a clutter about every
two weeks or so I will have my pasta
clutters a link down below or the
playlist if I have the playlist made yet
I'll have that link down below but I
hope that you guys enjoyed seeing this
one if you did I hope that you will give
it a thumbs up I hope that you will also
consider subscribing before you go and I
will catch you guys in that tomorrow's
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
