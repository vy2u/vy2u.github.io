going to be a makeup tutorial it's kind
of more of a little bit of a glam look
but it is using all affordable products
so this is going to be a full face
tutorial using everything affordable all
the makeup the lashes even the brushes i
have a few new brushes that i'm trying
out in this video that i was pretty
excited for but they are on the
Affordable side as well and i will leave
everything that i use a linked below of
course but it was around the time that i
did my drugstore like my top picks from
the drugstore was when i got the idea to
do a full face affordable tutorial as
well and i asked my snapchat fam and
they said yes they wanted to see it so
that is what i am doing a for today's
video so i really hope you guys like
this we'll look I got a bunch of new
color pop shadows and I didn't know if
they would all work together but I was
like let's give it a try and this is the
look that we came up with but yeah I am
really excited for this one I really
like this look I hope you do as well
please do give it a thumbs up if you do
enjoy it make sure you are subscribed
before you go and let's happen to the
tutorial so coming in first and priming
my eyes I just use my concealer and I'm
using just the next one that you will
see a little bit later and i'm using a
brush from my makeup brush set to blend
this in again i'll talk more about these
brushes in a little bit but yes this is
just what i use as my eye primer and
then to set that i use my Rimmel stay
matte translucent powder and the elf
small tapered brush so our I shadow does
not go anywhere and it looks good the
first shadow I'm coming in with is truth
from colour-pop it's a really pretty
light brown perfect transition shade
using a more fiemme at 443 to buff this
into the crease and then blend it in a
little bit higher and then the next
shadow I'm going to go in with is Lala
also from colour-pop I'm going to use my
morphe m4 for one for this one and this
color blew me away it is such a
beautiful metallic rose gold and I
absolutely love it now some people say
that you aren't supposed to put shimmers
in your crease I'm going for a very
shimmery sparkly look so I'm putting it
in the crease on the outer V and
blending it in and I just think it's
beautiful I just want to
it's this particular eyeshadow all over
my face if I could because I felt in
love with it but then I'm also going to
take it millionaire from colour-pop on
my morphe g13 brush this one has a lot
of hype around it and I'm not really
sure what I think yet it kind of came
off as more just glittery for me it does
have a bit of a brown base but mostly I
just thought it was kind of glittery it
was still very pretty it just ended up
being a bit of a different look than I
initially expected but I'm just padding
that on the lid and then blending it in
and then I will also pick up a little
bit more of Lala on my m4 for one brush
and blend it in and kind of build up la
la a little bit more cuz i ended up
actually being the color that I really
loved and I'm moving onto my face I'm
going to use the Milani Prime shield
mattifying primer to prime my face and
then the l'oreal pro glow foundation now
these are a brush set I was sent from my
makeup brush sunt now they are very
similar to like the artiste brushes or
the oval brushes and I was excited to
try them because I have don't have any
of those other brushes because they are
so expensive and this set is very
affordable and I actually believe i do
have a discount code so i will leave
that link down below if you guys are
interested but i got like a 10 piece
brush set and i looked at the price and
i think one time it was like twenty
dollars or something for the entire set
which is amazing I thought they worked
really well I think they are very very
soft so I ended up really liking them
but for concealer I'm going to come back
to my next sculpt and highlight duo and
use the concealer side for underneath my
eyes and then in the center of my face
then I'm going to grab another my makeup
brush set brush and use that to buff out
the concealer again i found the brush
really easy to use for this part as well
the only part that i had trouble with
was like getting right up underneath my
lashes that was a little bit more
challenging than was like a regular
brush or a beauty blender but other than
that it all worked out really well and
again the brushes are really soft and
they are not irritating to the face at
all which i thought was really good i do
plan on doing a full review video
shortly on these brushes because I want
to keep using them and try them out a
little bit more but for the first time
that I've used them I was pretty
impressed with them then i'm going to
set all that with my wet and wild
contouring palette and again my ELF a
small tapered brush just sending all the
areas that I put the concealer and then
I'm also going to set the foundation and
I'm going to use the Maybelline fit me
powder and my more feet III brush these
two are like a match made in heaven I
absolutely love them together and then
to contour I'm going to use the other
side of my neck sculpt and highlight duo
and carve out some cheekbones and also
along my forehead and then down the
bridge of my nose and then I do grab
another brush from my makeup brush set
for this now I had no problems with the
foundation or the concealer I thought
for the contour for cream contouring
that it was pretty hard to blend out it
ended up being pretty time-consuming so
i don't think i would recommend the
brushes necessarily for cream contouring
but i can try to play wrong with them a
little bit more but from my first
impression i think it would just be
easier for me to stick with my damp
Beauty Blender for when it comes to
contouring and then after I have blended
out the contour I will go in once again
was my wet and wild contouring palette
and my morphe m530 brush and i will go
ahead and use that to set the contour
and then also just kind of bronze up the
skin a little bit
or eyeliner I'm going to use the
Maybelline master precise liner I did
just do a winged liner tutorial video
and I absolutely rave about this
eyeliner I think it is so good so I'm
making a bit of a boulder wing for this
one since we're going for a little bit
more of a glam look here and then off
camera I did applied the ardell wispy
lashes for my waterline I want it just
like a pop of color so i'm using cry
baby from colour-pop i absolutely love
their liners they are amazing and then
for the lower lash line i'm going to
sweep first truth and then alala onto
the lower lash line with my morphe 36
brush I loved doing a little bit of
metallic on the under eyes of an Denver
mascara i'm going to use the Maybelline
lash sensational for my bottom lashes
and I also just kind of tap my real
lashes and where my fake lashes me to
make them look more natural for blush
I'm using a favorite luminoso from
Milani and my more feet m for 27 brush
and then I didn't have any affordable
highlighter so i'm using puppy love from
colour-pop and is technically an
eyeshadow and it is out of stock so I'm
sorry but I don't have any other
affordable options for highlight and
then to finish it off with the lips I'm
using Alyssa from colour-pop and it's a
new collab with Kathleen lights and it's
an ultra satin lip it's my first time
trying an ultra satin lip and I
absolutely love these I love this color
I love the formula and completely
obsessed with them then after the lips
this look is complete hope you guys
liked it
