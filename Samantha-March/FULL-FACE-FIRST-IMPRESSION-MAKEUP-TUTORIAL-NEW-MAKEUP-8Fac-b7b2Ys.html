today's video is going to be a full-face
makeup tutorial trying new makeup
products I've received so if you saw i
recently did a very large makeup haul
and I got a lot of different items I've
been kind of collecting things over the
last couple of halls that I've gotten
because there's been a lot of requests
to do this full face tutorial trying new
makeup for the first time kind of giving
you guys my first impressions feedback
seeing what I think of it so I thought
that was a really interesting idea so I
have a lot of different products I don't
have everything I'm probably missing
like three things maybe but for the
majority everything that I'm going to be
trying on my face is going to be for the
first time so you'll be seeing my first
impression and I'm really excited to see
how some of these products work out so I
hope that you enjoy this type of video
but why don't we go ahead and hop into
the tutorial I'm going to do is put a
lip serum on so i just received this
from lancer it's the volume enhancing
lip serum so i'm just going to go ahead
and pop this on my lips to see if maybe
by the end of the tutorial if we've seen
any sort of difference this is what it
looks like when you open it up okay and
then it just says to apply to clean dry
lips that's in lip line that feels
really cold on my lips okay so we'll see
how that goes I want to try Lex I've
been curious about it was cold and it's
already starting to tingle oh boy right
for primer I got a sample of the
two-faced hangover RX primer and I have
been waiting for so long to do this
tutorial because this was like one of
the first items i received and told
myself to hang on to it but everyone
talks about this primer like everybody
loves it so i have been so excited to
try it I was not expecting it to come
out white I'm not going to lie I I
wasn't expecting that I'm going to go
ahead and put on the skin so everyone
says this is just like super hydrating
they'll so good on the skin it is very
hydrating it almost feels like putting a
moisturizer on or something but ya feel
really good this is from anastasia
beverly hills and it is the new stick
foundation
so excited to try this out I've been
hearing really good things about it so
want to try it for myself it's my first
stick foundation that I'm ever using I
am in the shade natural this is what it
looks like when I hauled it I really
wasn't sure if this would be a good
color match for me so we'll go ahead and
see so I'm just going to do like some
stripes on my face and just hope this is
a decent color match because I have to
be somewhere after this so we shall see
I've also been saying that people are
saying using a brush has been better
than like a Beauty Blender so I'm going
to use my Sigma f80 the flat kabuki and
then I'm just going to go ahead and
blend that in ok so just like as I'm
starting here it looks to be a decent
match which is good because I was really
quite worried about that but it seems to
be a pretty good match so far getting it
a little bit hard to like move around
with the brush I don't know maybe
compared to like a liquid foundation it
isn't as easy to like blend in sort of
thing but nothing nothing too bad like
it's not not moving at all it's kind of
what I wondered about with a stick
foundation because my first thought was
to go in with the damp Beauty Blender
but everyone said the brushes work
better so that's why I'm using a brush
so it looks like I mean there's like
there's pretty good coverage I do like
the color match more than I thought it
would it didn't cover of all my areas of
redness but it covered most I mean just
on first glance like I think it looks
pretty good I don't feel like on my
first impression that this was super
life-changing but I'll definitely be
trying it out more I'll see you how the
makeup applies on top of it so far I
mean I like it it looks good we shall
see so curious a try it it is new from
Tarte and it is the shape tape concealer
I got the shade light medium and again
i'm not super sure if this shade is
going to be great look at this big
kahuna holy buckets I'm just going to
apply this to my under eyes and then use
it to conceal a couple areas of redness
I'm not going to do it
a full highlight and contour routine
today mostly because i'm fighting the
weather the lighting is not fantastic
right now so I'm feeling in a little bit
of a rush here but I really wanted to
get this filmed mostly cuz I want to be
using these products i've been so
excited to get him but i really wanted
to make those first impressions I'm
going to blend that out with my morphe
g2 as I'm blending it out it is super
easy to blend out and it looks really
full-coverage I have a red mark
underneath my eyes that like oh is pokes
through and it actually looks to be
pretty camel flage right now and that
does not happen very often I think this
is going to be a good color match it
looks good to cover like dark circles
it's probably I could have gone like a
shade lighter if I wanted it for more of
a highlighting effect but honestly I was
hearing that it was full coverage so I
was like I would prefer it for dark
circles more than I would highlighting
and it seems to be doing a really good
job that blend it out so fast are you
kidding me that blend it out so fast and
looks really good huh Wow okay first
impressions I feel like I can see I mean
it's a weird thing like I just tried
this out but I feel like I can already
tell why people are saying that's really
amazing because that was awesome I feel
like my under eyes do look really good
too oh ok so I'm liking that one so far
contour I'm going to use this pier cameo
contour it is a double ended stick and
it has highlight and contour but I
really wanted to use the tart concealer
so I'm just going to use the contouring
side of this so this is what it looks
like and it does come with its own like
beauty sponge type of thing as well so
i'll go ahead and apply this and then
get the sponge damp so i can blend it
out so here's what the contour side
looks like and in thy haul video i was
like oh shoot that might be too dark for
me but just go ahead and see
so I'm just going to start there for
right now like it kind of makes me a
word like how thick it is that I would
like way go overboard but right now just
try to be a little casual sorry if I'm
yours been in the camera I'm going to
try to do my nose doing the nose isn't
super easy with this one but giving it a
shot okay so I've got sponge damn so
i'll go ahead and blend it in and see
what I think so like actually applying
it to the skin and now blending it out I
don't think it's too dark no I think
that's going to work well so I wouldn't
say just like off first impressions I
wouldn't say that I feel like the sponge
in here is like the beauty blender or
anything like that first impression
feedback on this I'm just going to kind
of use my fingers to blend in for the
nose right now my first impression is
that I don't feel like I noticed a huge
difference like it's very I like I see
something but it's very natural if you
know what I'm saying like can you guys
tell that's I mean I don't know I can
you even see it in the camera like I
feel like after I blended it in it's
kind of like disappeared a little bit so
that's kind of a bummer cause I was
really looking forward to having like a
stick contour but maybe I just need to
use more product because I mean I try to
go in with a light hand because i
thought the shade might be too dark but
I don't know if maybe I do need to try
to do more product so you can see it
better because I just don't feel like
you really see a contour you know hmm
well there's that well that is the pier
cameo contour i'll play around with it a
little bit more and see what i think of
it but let's move on blush i'm going to
use a blush from Smashbox this was
actually sent to me a while ago they
sent me a few different of these blush
pellets
I haven't used this one yet and but this
one is in Culver City coral so these are
what the shades look like so there's two
different blood shades and then you also
have a highlight shade in there so I'm
going to use this first shade right here
which is called rich coral I believe and
I'm going to use my morphe for brush and
just ooh okay well that one's pigmented
you guys see that oh that's pigmented
that was one like tiny hit of that
palette like the tiniest little bit so
let me do some work on blending we're
just going to blend blend blend blend
these blushes are no joke I have tried
another pallet out one of the other
shades and again I thought they were
very pigmented and I use these for
cheeks but I've also used them on my
eyes as well I thought they were really
pretty so that's really pretty and very
very pigmented so very impressed with
these smashbox palettes like very
impressed with them they're called the
LA lights palettes and they have a
couple different colors in there as well
and they come with a highlight that was
pretty good fettle palette i'm going to
be using the tartlet in bloom palette
from Tarte now this wasn't a new palette
but it's new to me it's brand new I've
never used it and i've been so excited
to bust into this honestly because of
what the weather is doing outside i'm
probably not going to do anything super
crazy today and i probably wouldn't want
to just with the first impressions type
of thing so we'll probably go for a
pretty basic look first I'm going to
pick up smarty pants right here it just
looks like a really pretty matte brown
shade and I'm going to use my morphe m4
33 and then I'm just going to apply this
into my crease I pick up a rebel right
here and my Sigma e25 and I'm going to
place that a little bit lower in the
crease and just kind of blend it in and
based on just the first two colors that
I've done I know that I'm going to get
along with this palette they are super
pigmented and very very easy to blend
it's so funny because like i said this
palette is not a new release but people
all are still raving about it like it
kind of reminds me of the morphe 35o
where people are like it doesn't matter
that it's not new like everybody just
needs to have this palette in their life
like this is what that one reminds me of
so I'm really really happy that I
finally got it and then I think I'm
going to go in with rocker which is this
shade right up here it's kind of like a
silverish purple color and it has a
little bit of shimmer to it and I'm
using my Sigma e55 it's just like a flat
shader brush and I'm just going to
casually sweep that along the lids oh
that's pretty so it didn't look like it
had like a ton of shimmer by any means
in it but it's still looking pretty
shimmery on the eyes that is way pretty
and take no extra prod I can go back to
my sigma brush and just kind of blend
everything together real quick off
camera I just did a little bit of like
brown liner on my waterline and then I
did that last call everything goes rebel
from the palette I just swiped a little
bit of that on the lower lash line and
then for mascara I got a sample of the
Too Faced better than sex mascara the
waterproof version so I've been really
curious to try it out to see if it's
really similar to the regular version I
really like the packaging it has like
it's textured like there's actually
raindrops on it so that's kind of fun
let me go ahead and put this on so I
don't know I don't wear waterproof
mascara a whole lot but so I don't know
if this is like a waterproof mascara
thing but it feels like the formula is
super super dry like normally I wouldn't
have to dip back into the mascara twice
oops we'll fix that normally I wouldn't
have to dip back into the mascara twice
but I am with this I mean it definitely
reminds me a ton of the original version
where it makes the lashes like fluffy is
the words that I think I've always used
to describe the original Too Faced
better than sex mascara like I don't
feel like it makes them super black or
super long but it definitely gives them
like more
volume and they just look a bit fluffier
so if you really like the Too Faced
better than sex mascara but you are like
a waterproof gal type of person these
really are basically the same thing just
going to go ahead and wipe that away
these really are basically the same
thing but let me zoom you in so I just
applied the mascara and look what's
already happening there's already a fall
out I don't see any on the top lids but
yeah there's already fall out on here
which makes me not very happy because I
loved that concealer so that is
something that I want to point out to
you right away I've noticed it a few
times with the better than sex mascara
but nothing like too bad but I've never
seen mascara transfer that quickly so
that does not make me happy at all
because that's like the worst is when
you have mascara down there so huh
alright guys so I have all of the makeup
products on my face would you guys think
let me know seriously there let me know
what you thought of the first face try
on first impressions makeup tutorial
because it is my first time doing it and
I'm just curious if you guys actually
find these helpful because first
impressions can be kind of hard because
it truly is a first impression I'm not
giving you how they where I'm not giving
you how they hold up i'm not giving you
how they last you know i can do a follow
up video for this and give the actual
reviews of the products but for the
first impressions like I'm just really
curious if you guys do find this helpful
I mean so many people requested it and I
know these videos are really popular on
youtube so I feel like maybe they are
but to give a little bit of a wrap up a
sew my lips that I put the lip serum on
they tingled for about five seconds and
then I didn't feel them tingle anymore
been checking my lips I don't really
notice a difference but again I've only
had it on for maybe like 40 minutes or
so so I don't know I'll keep wearing it
i'll keep seeing i don't know if it's
maybe something that you need to use
like over time and it makes your lips
bigger it didn't say anything like that
but i don't know the primer I really did
like I don't know if I thought it like
filled and pours really well or anything
like that but it
very hydrating on the skin so I don't
know I i feel like i'm going to have to
test this one out but i have a feeling
everyone says that they love it so I'm
like it has to be good right like has to
be good the first impression that I'm
just kind of like I don't know yet the
anastacio foundation again I thought it
looked really nice on the skin me it is
kind of just like a normal finish and I
don't even know if that is the thing but
I didn't think it made my skin look
really luminous I didn't think it made
my skin look very matte it just made my
skin almost look like my skin but a
little bit better like a little bit more
enhanced but I didn't think it was
anything like super luminous or super
matte it would probably just fall like
in the middle of them i would say it did
apply well i do want to see what it
would be like with a Beauty Blender
because I feel like with a brush it was
a little bit harder to move around but
happy with my color match my shade was
unnatural again and I thought that
worked really well but I'll see I have a
feeling that I'm gonna like it i'm sure
i will review that coming up because
that is a really hot item that's out
right now the tart concealer i was very
impressed with like that truly was a
first impression that I was like yep I
like this I love the coverage that it
gave it was very full coverage it
covered all of my marks like I have this
red mark under my eye that nothing seems
to cover and that thar concealer covered
it it looked really really nice on the
under eyes and I feel like concealer
like I said I feel like concealer so
weird thing to get excited about but
like as I was doing the rest of my
makeup I kept like looking at my under
eye area I was like this just looks
really nice so very excited about that
product again the tartlet and bloom
palette like I feel like I could already
tell I used three shades out of the
palette only three shades and I was like
I get it I get why people are talking
about this but not only just the three
shades that I used that I thought were
really pigmented and really beautiful
but the entire palette on a whole just
looks so stunning I cannot wait to see
some looks with it if you guys would
want to see a makeup tutorial using that
palette let me know in the comments
below and I definitely could and play
around and maybe do something a little
bit more out of the box then then what I
did today the contour kind of
disappointed me because I felt like as I
was
in the contour I just kind of faded away
I will try the next time I use it to use
more product and see if maybe that helps
but my first impression on that one
wasn't truly great because I just felt
like as I was blending I was just
blending it away so that was a little
bit disappointing a two-faced mascara I
actually was really disappointed in and
that really surprised me but I had
immediate fallout on my face which is
really frustrating and that's like the
last thing that I wanted a mascara is to
have the flakes on my under eyes
especially when I loved my concealer so
much so I will try it again probably
days that i'm just going to be around my
house not actually going out in case it
does happen again but if it happens the
next couple of times that I try it then
I'm definitely giving this a product
ain't no good because the last thing you
want is mascara fall out like that you
end up looking like a raccoon is that
everything that I tried out hopefully
that's everything if I missed anything I
can leave that in the description box
below but that's just kind of my
overview of the products that I actually
put them on and has a little bit of time
to think about it look in the mirror a
little bit more I can try to like give
you my feedback right here versus
actually in the tutorial when i'm using
them and I don't really have a lot of
thoughts going through my mind yet just
let me know if you found this video
helpful because if you do like them and
you do want to see more of them I
definitely will be doing that for you so
just let me know in the comments below
if you want to see more of these types
of videos I really hope that you found
this one helpful if you did I hope you
will give it a thumbs up make sure you
are subscribed before you go and I'll
just get you a real soon in my next one
