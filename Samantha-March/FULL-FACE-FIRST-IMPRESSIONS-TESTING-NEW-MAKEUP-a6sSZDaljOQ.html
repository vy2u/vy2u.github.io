so today's video is going to be a
full-face first impression testing out
new makeup 2% when I'm calling this
video yet but basically we're going to
get ready together and I'm going to
using all new makeup products to me and
I'm so excited it's I think I have
something new in like every single
category so we have a lot to go through
most of this is new makeup like new
releases but some of it is a bit older
but it's just new to me so I'll be going
through testing everything out letting
you know my first impression stuff and
all of that before we get started I do
want to say thank you so much for
clicking on this video I am doing a
daily upload right now so if you like it
getting daily content on makeup and
beauty I hope that you will consider
hitting the subscribe button if several
giveaways going on right now and I know
my next one is ending very very soon so
I will have all of my giveaway links in
the description box down below if you
want to enter in any of them and I'm
really excited to finally try out some
of these makeup products so why don't we
go ahead and get started
so I have you guys zoomed in the only
thing that I feel like I didn't have
knew was an eyelid primer so I do have
my eyes primed I'm just going to put on
this little unicorn headband here that I
got from bio Belle cosmetics but I think
it's super cute because I am going to go
in with my eyes first typically I do my
eyes in my face and my eyes and finish
up the face so that is how we are doing
this one I'm really excited because I
actually got to spend to me in PR and I
was completely surprised but this is
from a pure cosmetics and it is their My
Little Pony it's a movie I shadow
palette they actually send me the full
collection which really surprised me
because I used to get PR from Pierre and
then the past while I haven't gotten
anything from them we're just totally
fine I still love Pierre and I still buy
and use our products a lot so I don't
really know why I got sensus all of a
sudden again but I was really excited
because if you watched I did a will i
buy it video and I mentioned this
palette and I was saying how I like the
way that it looked and if it was similar
to the troll talent that Pierre came out
with I thought it would be a really good
formula but it was just a little bit too
similar to the trolls palette and I was
buying more eyeshadow palettes so I
decided to forgo this one but I was
still really interested in it so I'm
I was really grateful that they send it
to me I have no idea what I'm going to
do yet here is what the palette looks
like if you like first impressions I
typically do something a little bit more
on the normal size a shade generosity
from the top row this is my Sigma e-40 I
like the palette because it does have a
mere two so I'm just going to go ahead
and put that into my crease I noticed
when looking at the shadow kind of on
first glance it looks like you know kind
of your basic Brown transition but when
I looked at a little closer it actually
looks to have kind of like a purple
undertone so that's kind of interesting
I know that I really want to use this
mint green color on my lid so excess
funds like I don't know I feel like I
need to come in with another color but
I'm honestly just thinking that Brown
because I don't know if the purple in
the mint will go together and I was
going to come in with this purple Shea
right or this brown shade right here
called honesty I'm going to use a morphe
brush from the copper dreams brush set I
mentioned this in my favorite makeup
brushes video so I'll leave that link
down below I'm just going to build this
on the outer corner of my eye I know
what when I do like first impression
videos and honestly even when I try
makeup myself for the first time I just
don't do crazy makeup looks because
that's not quite and I do really want to
use the mint green which I don't know if
that's super normal but I feel like my
first few steps are super basic but you
know sometimes smooth those are just
basic and I'm okay with that so that
shows actually I mean it looks pretty
dark in the pan but it's almost like
Browns black on the eyes that get is
very very dark so I'm just concentrating
this on the outer part of my eye and
then slowly kind of flicking it outwards
and slowly into the crease but not too
far in gonna grab my youth 40 again and
just kind of blend everything out I
don't want it to be too dark because
then that green shade is so light but I
just wanted a little little depth out
there is all so now I'm going to go in
with the mint shade so I grabbed my
morphe g-20 brush and i just spray it
with a little bit of setting powder and
then I'm going to pick up princess
sky star and put this all over the lid
I'm not familiar with My Little Pony so
I don't quite get all these names but
wow that is that's frigging pretty Oh
oh man I'm so glad I decided to go
officiate that is so pretty so I'm
focusing this mostly on the inner part
of my lid and I'm gonna blend with my
e-40 because I don't know what I feel
about that dark brown shade so while my
camera was cooling down I started in on
the other eyes and I'm just kind of
blending everything together I feel like
the same more than this eye but uh you
know that happens kind of like a mint
chocolate look mint chocolate and
chocolate ice cream well I do I still
like it but I'm interested in the
formula of these because I mean I liked
the mint color a lot and that showed up
really well I did use a setting spray
but it showed up really well but the
masks just didn't really like blow me
away like I noticed in the trolls
palette the first time I used the troll
pellet and I like dipped my brush in
like you could tell it was just super
super pigmented whereas like with this
one I kind of felt like I have to really
swirl my brush in there and kind of go
back and forth and I don't know I mean
it's blending okay but it's not it's not
blending the easiest and it's not
blending like the trolls pellet so
that's interesting because I was most
excited for this because I love that
trolls tell it so much I was hoping it
would be just like it and um no I don't
think it's I don't think it's like super
super similar to it but without going on
for the eyes right now I wanted to lay
down the shadows first before I did my
face if I have any fallout I don't have
too much just a little bit over here
with that mint color but nothing too bad
fallout wise I don't like the eyes alone
for right now and then switch over to my
face
before my face I have a new primer here
new to me this is the urban defense
complexion primer so as a broad-spectrum
SPF 30
smoothing environmental protection
primer this is what it looks like I got
a huge package
from Urban Decay the other day and just
completely blown away to even beyond
Urban Decay's radar like that is crazy
oh my gosh look at this packaging oh it
has a pump it's like super liquidy like
very sir--my liquidy type of feeling so
it smells like like it smells like a
pool but not chlorine I don't know if
that makes any sense but like it doesn't
have a doesn't have a chlorine smell but
it still reminds me of what the hotel
pool or something like that and for a
foundation I'm going to use this one
from a shivaji this is the photo
perfection fluid foundation this is what
the outer packaging looks like this was
sent to me from octoly for review so
thank you to actively and as you don't
see for sending this to me I've never
I've never tried anything from them so
this was like super crazy to get accept
it it well going to go ahead and give it
a shake I picked out the shade perfect
honey so I have no idea if it'll be a
good shade match or not but we'll see it
does have a pump on it so I'm going to
do a few pumps onto my Sigma 3d HD max
kabuki this is my favorite a foundation
brush at the moment so first thing that
I notice is that it has a very strong
scent but it's not that like it doesn't
smell bad or like chemically like it
almost has like a kind of fruity scent
like a floral scent maybe the color
match looks to be pretty decent I just
up on Sephora is $51 which I mean that's
pricey but not as bad as I thought it
was going to be I saw a new Tom Ford
Foundation that was like 80 or 85
dollars honestly that's kind of where I
was thinking of this one but like the
hourglass vanish stick is like 46 I
think so I guess it's not as bad as I
thought it was going to be it says it's
full to medium coverage which I would
say medium coverage you could probably
build it up but I don't really like full
coverage and I like the way it's looking
right now so I'm going to leave it at
this has the SPF of 20 so there could be
flashback concerns if you're doing any
sort of flash photography and it says
a naturally flawless florist foundation
for a luminous complexion as of right
now I don't feel like it made me
instantly look like super dewy or
luminous but I can tell it's also not
very mattifying it almost looks more
like a satin finish as of right now but
it feels nice on the skin I like the
coverage to it I'm a solid like medium
coverage girl and that's what it looks
like so far but for concealer I actually
did get a package from morphe recently -
which was again for exciting super like
crazy that some of these brands notice
little ole Mason now I was so that's
really cool but they sent along four of
their concealers so I'm going to try one
and very curious because I actually
haven't heard great things about their
concealers but they sent me four
different shades and I picked out the
one in new don't here's what the
applicator looks like so it's kind of
about like flat on both sides I'll just
go ahead and see huh so I can tell right
away that like it's not very creamy
those are really dry and kind of look
hard to move so I don't know see how it
blends out I'm kind of nervous but uh
maybe I should have done one eye at a
time oh boy I used to take my Sigma s 79
and start to blend this out you know I
just typically prefer just like a creamy
concealer that's super easy to blend and
I think that was the first thing I
noticed with this one is that it felt
really dry but it seems to be blending
out okay so I don't know we'll see it I
think this would be best with a Beauty
Blender though because it is kind of
hard like I think you need to do one
eyes and the other eye
instead of like I normally do my full
concealer I don't think that's a good
plan because it's almost like it's
already dried on this side can you tell
that I'm having troubles blending it in
because it's like it already tried
definitely something that I noticed Oh
Lord how am I going to blend in my
forehead oh boy oh boy time sensitive
concealer over here
so they send feelers from morphe are
only $4.99 so that is like incredibly
inexpensive
I know morphe has really high shipping
but if you ever like saving up for a
morphe trip I think they just lowered
their
shipping I think you used to have to hit
$100 now you have to hit 75 which is
still a lot and then their shipping cost
is still high if you don't hit that mark
but if you're someone like me who like
waits and orders in bulk then it's
really not so bad for the $4.99 I just
got that sent to me from Pixie it's
their quick fix powder it does the
translucent setting powder so this is
the packaging that it came in so I
thought I could give this a try it's
interesting though because it says it
comes with a puff because you can like
Pat it you know all over your face if
you want but I don't want to use the
toughest as I just want to put it on my
under eyes most the puff is small enough
so this is what it looks like I just
look it up it's $20 it's for three grams
of product but I don't know pics they
supposed to be like affordable this is a
little mirror here they're sold at
Target so they're considered like an
affordable drugstore brand but they're
definitely on the higher end side so
what it looks like inside I'm going to
leave the puffs in there because I'm
already making a huge mess oh I'm just
going to grab out the morphe of 49 and
I'm just going to dip it lightly into
the powder as lightly as I can and cap
it off I don't want to bake because I'm
not really in a baking mood today I do
want to set everything so I'm just kind
of lightly going over it and underneath
my eyes which I really do like the way
that's looking so far that's pretty good
is that I'm not going to bake or
anything so it comes dust that off
really quickly with my morphe 83 and
then go super heavy or anything but I
still like the way that it looks like it
I actually I actually like that it looks
pretty good it's just it's kind of
pricey I mean I would try to get it with
like your target red card or something
and then I'm going to move on to
contouring and bronzing so morphe also
sent me their 9c palette so this is what
this one it looks like I was super
excited to get this because this was
just like right up my alley
I'm not hundred percent sure what shades
should use I'm going to go for this like
pretty cool toned one down here in the
middle and my Sigma
six brush so I like this brush because
it gets like ripe all right up in there
okay so far so looks pretty good for a
contour shade maybe a little bit on the
dark side but and I'm going to see what
this one looks like over here for a
bronzer shade I'm going to use this is a
new brush from motive brushes as part of
their metallic line it's the buffer
brush I'm gonna see what it looks like
for bronzer so that looks pretty I like
that
so far I like the way that everything is
applying like over the foundation I'm
not noticing any issues with the
foundation yet so that's pretty good
you know sometimes first impressions are
hard because it's hard to like give
reviews and feedback but if you guys
want to see me do a full dedicated
follow up to everything that I use in
this video let me know because I could
certainly film that in a couple weeks so
again that would be morphe 9c and then a
new brush from Mota but for blush the
only new one that I had is from this
Kevin of Kwan making faces book beauty
book so this is what it looks like I
featured this in a haul recently but it
is super cool when you open it up you
actually have like three smaller books
here and then it says like chapter one
is for contour chapter two is blush and
define and then chapter three is
emphasized eyes so you have contour
highlight bronzer and then like in the
third one is all eye shades but in the
second chapter we have blush and define
so this is what it looks like so I'm
going to try out one of these blush
shades even though they both look pretty
dark to me but I'm going to give them a
try this listen to me from heaven upon
which still like just makes no sense to
me how come to confound me but uh
there's that but I think I'm going to
use this first shade over here blush
chador I think is what it's called and
my morphe for it looks very bright and
very pigmented so I'm going to try to go
in with a light hand and I can already
tell that that is super super pigmented
the whole book at $75 which is which is
pricey I mean Kevin upon I feel like
more of a luxury brand I mean definitely
high-end brand but like luxury brand too
but I'm I mean I'm telling you guys
everything that I've been trying I've
been so so impressed with so and you get
a lot of different items like I said the
sculpting powder highlight bronzer blush
shade a whole eyeshadow palette like
that's pretty crazy well that was pretty
I think it's a little Pinker than I
normally would go for but I think it's
still really pretty so I'm going to try
brows and I'm pretty nervous about this
because I'm not very talented with brows
yet but I got a package from ardell
Beauty they're expanding they came out
with some new like eyeshadows Big Ten's
mascaras lipsticks and they also came
out with this stroke a brow feathering
pen so this is what it looks like I
grabbed out the shade taupe and we'll
just give it a try so this is what it
actually looks like I think these are
$9.99 I can have the price in the
description box but I just never used
anything really like this for brows and
like I said I'm just not very good at
brows I'm kind of nervous but you know
we're going to give it a try we're going
to give it we're going to give it a try
together so I feel like I don't know
what I'm doing so I'm just going to
start underneath the brow am I trying to
press so light but you can actually
press with a bit of a firmer hand I just
feel like the tip is so flimsy like I
don't understand how to do anything
super precise hmm I don't know what I'm
thinking about this so far um I don't
know guys I've never tried anything like
this I'm going to try to do a couple
like licks in here I've just never tried
anything like this but you know give
stuff a try for the video but I don't
think we're going to be super compatible
it was like me trying the pomade when I
did the full face using samples
challenge
that did not go well I think I'm just
more of a pencil girl for my eyebrows
like those are those seem to be the only
thing that I can actually get the hang
of so I don't I don't think this is
looking too great so I don't really know
if you spool you through this type of a
product but I think it'll make me feel
better about myself if I just pull these
out out quickly and try to make it look
somewhat normal
although I'm not really feeling this one
you guys but I don't think it's the
products fault I think it's my fault but
I don't know what the heck I'm doing but
I want to give it a try but I'm not
really uh I'm not really feeling that
it's just kind of hard for me to get the
hang out because the like felt-tip is so
flimsy I feel like I can't control where
I'm putting in so there's a second brow
I don't know I maybe like it a little
bit better than the first there are some
brows um not not the greatest but I
don't think this is super like
beginner-friendly and I'm saying that as
a beginner I just feel like pencils are
the easiest I've tried the pomade and
and things like that and I just I still
think the regular old pencils not like
these like crazy salt tips I think those
are the best for beginners when I finish
off the eyes so I'm going to line my
waterline with this rice cosmetics
infinity broader proof liner in the
shade nalli this is what it looks like
so it's just a brown eyeliner so I'm
just going to line my waterline I
present so this isn't really it's not
super pigmented like it's not going in
the water lines of us I'm going to kind
of smudge it on the lower lash line it
kind of like drags a little bit but I
don't know like on the waterline it's
not really doing much I'll try to
tightline as much as I can but I like a
super creamy pigmented liner which is
kind of a bummer line underneath my lash
line but I don't do that all the time I
just always wanted on my waterline and
tightline but it's not
very creamy or pigmented so it's not
really doing much okay I'm going to come
back into the appear My Little Pony
palette and I feel like I want to do
some sort of pop of color on the bottom
but now I don't know what to do because
I'm still not super impressed with how
the eyes came out to be honest I'll
start with that deeper brown shade and
this is a more PM 507 it's just like a
pencil brush to try this like deeper
green shade it's called loyalty I'm just
going to use the same brush and I'm just
going to kind of Pat it in on the lower
lash line and then blend it out for I
just feel like I need a little bit more
color so that one I mean I'm just like
very lightly using it but it's showing
up really well so I feel like maybe the
shimmers in here better than the mask
because so far like the two masks just
didn't really like they're fine but they
just didn't like super astound me you
see how well it's showing up so I went
really Pamela brown the sides I'm going
to try to match the sides I really like
with the green did for that look which
is excites me so now I'm going to grab
my morphe 18 I'm really sorry if you can
hear areas because she is snoring
really loud right next to me I'm gonna
grow up kind of this like pink sparkly
shade at repenting a little bit of cube
from subculture palette it's called
Twilight Sparkle I don't know if it's
going to be too pink but let me try to
my inner corner first that's not bad
I'm just going to tap a little bit on to
the inner corner and then a little bit
underneath see we're actually really
like the green I like the mint green and
I like the green on my lower lash line
I'm glad I decided to go with that that
cheered me up
I wasn't really feeling it at first but
sometimes makeup looks you don't like
them till the very end
I like that shake you I feel like it's
really starting to pull everything
together so I'm not mad now mad we're
coming back we're coming back onto My
Little Pony so no that's good my brows
Juliana crazy though so hopefully you
guys aren't looking at them and to
finish off the eyes I actually just got
this today this is a new mascara from
Urban Decay
packaging it is called troublemaker it
says it is their super fat super long
sex proof mascara you know I have never
been like me and I need a stick proof
mascara I guess that's never gone
through my mind but okay so the little
card says the troublemaker mascara will
be $24 it will launch September and also
be available at Sephora Ulta and select
Macy's stores and online what it looks
like I'm not used to giving like Sun
safe fancy packages like this huh kind
of makes me uncomfortable at least I
know that this is sex proof I mean I
can't I'm not I can't get over that
here's what the packaging looks like
super super fun definitely like the
holographic trend 100% and let's see oh
here's what the wand looks like I don't
know if that was what I was expecting
when it said super fat I guess I was
expecting like a really fat wand I don't
know but let's go ahead and give this a
try I don't have any new lashes right
now it kind of feels like a dryer mess
mascara formula I feel like it's giving
my lashes a very wispy vibe which I
don't mind at all because that's
typically the lashes that I gravitate
towards like the false lashes I
gravitate towards is wispy so I don't
feel like it's like I don't get why it
says super fat because I don't feel like
it's super fat it's just making them
like fluffy and wispy and pretty I like
it so far I do like it like I said I
mcli wear false lashes but because I
didn't have any new lashes to wear I was
actually going to try the art doll
mascara and then like I said this too
short of today so I decided to play with
this one it's not like blowing me out of
the water right away but I like the
wispy effect it's giving to the lashes
so here are lashes with DMS Giron might
have much for new highlighters but this
a fashion fanatic palette from Mac
next I mentioned it in my recent make up
monthly it has eight different
eyeshadows in here and then it also has
a highlight over here so I'm going to
try out that highlight so I think it's
only highlights what I have that's new
that I haven't used so I'm just going to
go ahead and use my Alexi 5:22 brush I
mean I think it's pretty but it's not
super it's not like super blinding like
I kind of like my highlights a little
bit more unlike the I am side it's not
like super BAM in your face but it's
still pretty don't know how well the
camera will pick it up but it definitely
has kind of like a peachy shift to it
just if it had just a little bit more of
a boost I think I would be more into it
but but it's pretty good and I thought
the other shadows were decent like when
I mentioned it in my makeup monthly it
was in the like okay category so that's
how I would classify this highlight to
like it's okay it's not going to be my
favorite I don't see myself like a
reaching for it a ton but it's alright
then to finish it off with lips I was
recently sent and packaged it from nude
sticks and they sent along this is
called Haven they said it's a gel bomb
but that you can use it for lip and
cheek this is what it looks like I
looked it up on these Sephora website
and it is $24 I think that looks really
pretty it's so nice it's almost kind of
like a peachy nude and it's more like
the creamy lipstick formulas so I do not
mind that so if I don't think I'm going
to do is spray my face also in the Urban
Decay package they sent me their chill
makeup setting spray for cooling and
hydrating I have never tried any of the
urban decay makeup mist so this like
really excites me actually I was pretty
stoked to see it move so fancy like I
really kept part of like an in crab now
but I finally have these like part of
the crowd so I'm going to go ahead and
spray my face myself a quick quick fan
here block everything in mm-hmm
yeah oh yeah I'm feeling it feeling I'm
some of that guys alright so this is the
final look that I came up with and using
a new method of testing out a new makeup
first impressions let me know what you
guys think down below so to run through
everything
I was actually kind of concerned with
how his ilyich was going to turn out
because I wasn't feeling those two maps
that I went in with from the appear My
Little Pony but the mint really I love
that make color the green on the lower
lash line I'm actually pretty obsessed
with and then I even did like that pink
color that I use I feel like that really
did tie everything together so obviously
I'm gonna have to give it everything you
know more than one try but luckily those
shimmers redeem themselves
shoot thankfully the foundation I still
think it looks really well I mean of
course I've only had it on my face I
mean it's probably been almost two hours
because these videos take forever to
film when your camera overheats so
something that looks good on the skin I
don't have any complaints about the
foundation the concealer the only big
complaint that I had about it was that
it was really drying and you had to work
really quickly they'd enjoy the contour
and bronzer shade from that morphe 9c
palette I feel like I have others that I
like more but I like that just fine as a
first impression less from the termina
quan palette I thought was really pretty
I don't think either of the shades are
necessarily like my go-to vibes they're
a little bit too dark for me but I still
thought it was pretty the Mac highlight
was okay to me it's not like my favorite
highlight but it does look pretty and I
do like that kind of like peach
iridescent shift that it has to it the
brow pencil from ardell I don't think
I'm going to like I mean I need to try
it a little bit more let me know what
you guys think but I don't know how well
I feel like my brows are looking at the
mascara so far I think is okay it seems
like a decent mascara but nothing that
really blew me away I did really like
that pixie setting powder I mean I'm
gonna have to try it a couple more times
but right off the bat I did like the the
finish it gave to my under eye so it's
20 dollars which I think think is really
expensive you surprised cosmetics
eyeliners just didn't really do anything
for me it wasn't very pigmented or
creamy so that one was a bit of a Miss
for me and the lip product
actually really do life the way that it
looks I know that I have a lot of
lipsticks like this so I don't know
we'll have to see the long wear of it
but I really like the new shade and have
nice and comfortable on the lips I think
it looks really pretty and then the
urban decay setting spray I mean so far
so good so there's that sometimes first
impressions are hard to do but I wanted
to be able to test out some new makeup
and I mentioned it on snapchat a lot of
people said they wanted to see it this
is the final look that I came up with I
really hope that you guys enjoyed it I
hope that you enjoyed it seeing some
first impressions and testing out new
makeup let me know what you think in the
