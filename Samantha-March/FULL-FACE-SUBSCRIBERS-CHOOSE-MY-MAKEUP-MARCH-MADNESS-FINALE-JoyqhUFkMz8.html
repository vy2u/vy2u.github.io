so excited for today's video because it
is my March Madness a finale video if
you have mad to caught my March Madness
series for the past several weeks here
I've been doing kind of an interactive
series on my channel where I'm letting
you guys a vote on the products that you
would want to see me use in a full face
using products that my subscribers chose
for me and today is the finale video I
just closed the votes on the round 2 of
voting so I have everything tallied up
here I'm gonna go through and do a full
face using the top requested products
and the thank you guys so much for
making this series is so much fun I had
a lot of fun with it from picking out
the floor products to seeing which of
the top two got to move on to round 2
and then it was so fun I like I said I
just went through and closed the final
round 2 video and just seeing like what
what categories were super close which
category is like one product kind of
blue the other one out of the water it's
just been a lot of fun to see I feel
like this is also going to be a
challenge I'm gonna go through one step
at a time and slowly reveal all the
products but this might also be a
challenge because I don't know how this
look is gonna come together with the
eyeshadow palette with the eyeliner with
the lipstick but I'm just I want to go
ahead and give it my best shot but thank
you guys if you missed any of the March
Madness videos and you'd want to catch
up and see how it all went down till we
got to this video I will have all of
them listed down below I also do a
giveaway with the March Madness series
and I'm hoping that I will have to
giveaway winner listed in the
description box I originally wanted to
say it here on camera but I also
realized that the polls closed on Friday
I typically don't film on the weekends
and I don't think I would be able to
have time to film on the weekends so I
needed to film it right away so I still
have to go through the rest of the
entries and see who filled out a perfect
bracket but I got I got a lot of makeup
to get done today so why don't we go
ahead and get started
ok so I'll get you guys a zoomed in I
got my ears on I'm having to fill them
up with my ring lights today because
it's dark and dreary and very very windy
outside which I'm so bummed like each of
the two times this week Oh what's
snowing two in the two times that I
filmed like makeup like getting ready
with me type of videos for this week
it's been no sunshine I've had to pull
my regal eyes
I just don't really like to do but the
primer that was chosen with 72% 72% is
the Smashbox a photo finish primer Ezzor
not really all that surprised this
primer is getting a whole bunch of hype
a lot of people are really enjoying it
myself included I have the little menu
for $15 but I just highly recommend this
primer I have dry skin but I even know
people with really oily skin I've been
raving about it as well so it's just one
of my faves
foundation was a pretty close battle but
it was the number seven estate perfect
foundation that won with 52% I again I
said it when I talked about it in the
round 2 video I was a little surprised
to see the number 7 because I feel like
you don't hear about them being talked
about especially as a makeup brand I
feel like I hear more about their skin
care but their makeup products are
actually really good as well but a lot
of people wrote in and said you know
this is your favorite foundation you
love this foundation you have several
shades of the foundation etc so I
thought that was pretty cool to see so
I'm just gonna use my L'Oreal sponge and
I am using the shade what she does this
this is warm beige a lot of people were
asking me if I was going to do this next
March as well I totally want to I had so
much fun with it and if you're newer I
was letting people use I was kind of
utilizing the community tab and I was
doing the polls that way so it was
really easy to do the votes and see like
what was the most requested and all of
that and like I was saying with the
giveaway I had people fill out a bracket
and just pick what they thought was
going to be the winner in each category
and then whoever got the most right was
going to win a prize and I did a
giveaway video as well and I will say
that I split round two into two
different parts so the first part was
closed last week and so I went through
it and I looked at everyone's brackets
and seven people had them all correct I
think it was eight categories they had
all eight categories correct through the
first voting of round two so I'm really
excited to see if anyone still
maintained the perfect bracket all the
way throughout and all of that so I'm so
excited
I should have the giveaway winner listed
in the description box and I also do
like to have them confirm with me first
before I announce anything so I guess
you know it might take a little bit for
them to get back to me as well but that
should be up by the time this video goes
up for the concealer with a 61 percent
of the votes is the urban decay and
naked skin concealer this is one of my
favorite concealers I was excited to see
it I have the shade light neutral so
because I'm just kind of going a step by
step I'm gonna use this also as an eye
primer so I'm just gonna apply some
under the eyes and then also on the
eyelid but yes I was super impressed to
see seven people having that perfect
bracket through the first half I thought
that was pretty awesome so if there was
gonna be a tie I'm just gonna put the
names in the random name generator but I
thought that was just a really fun part
to do I love doing giveaways and I just
thought of it you know kind of play more
into like the March Madness as well as
March Madness is a college basketball
tournament and a lot of people get
really excited myself included to fill
out a bracket and you know kind of guess
who will make it to the final tournament
and all of that how did your guys's
brackets go mine was like completely
imploded on the first day they do want
to do it again next year and honestly
the bracket part wasn't that bad like it
was pretty easy I just use like Google
sheets and it was really easy to
highlight you know all of the correct
answers and go through like it was less
difficult than I thought it was gonna be
I thought it was gonna take me forever
it truly took me like 20 minutes to to
look at everybody's from the first round
so it wasn't bad at all I definitely
want to do this again for my setting
powder I was a little surprised to see
this as the winner this is the alarm
mercier secret brightening powder a lot
of people really love the translucent
powder and you hear a lot about that but
not really so much about the secret
brightening and this is a very
brightening powder here's what it looks
like setting putters are so messy I'm
just gonna use my sponge and put this on
my under eyes as well I really like
especially when I bought this too I was
really into those super super bright
under eyes like using a lighter
concealer using a brightening powder and
all of that so that's why I was more
attracted to the secret brightening
powder I still like it I don't use
setting powders as much lately I used
like a pressed powder but I do still
like this one I really do a heavy bake
on my undereyes anymore either so I just
kind of go in lightly and then I like to
tap it with the sponge and then I'll
just make sure I do go in and just brush
off the excess even though like I don't
feel like I look as you know when some
people bake it's a very very heavy bake
I don't necessarily like that for me
anymore especially right now with having
a drier skin so I'll just go through and
brush it off or the contour shade
winning at 64% was the Kat Von D a shade
and light palette and so this is the
shade that I use a for contour so that
is what I'm going to use today I just
have this little elf brush this is the
m-104 I'll of course link all the
products that I'm using and I will also
link all of the brushes that I'm using
as well that contour can look a little
harsh until I bronze episode don't mind
that but this one kind of ran away with
the votes a 78% for bronzer vote it for
the Physicians Formula thank you guys
this is in my 18 and 2018 project pan so
I appreciate you trying to help me hit
pan or do something with this brother I
wanted this bronzer so much that I'm
like kind of bored with it but I'm like
wow I'm really it feels like if it feels
like it's a brand new bronzer I'm like
how is this even possible so just gonna
use this to bronze up but this was a
really fun series to have it be a little
bit more interactive and you know things
like that I just I don't know I thought
it was so much fun I know people were
asking if I could do something similar
to it again like another series like
this but I have no ideas in mind so if
you guys have any ideas where you know
we can do some voting again or I don't
know just be interactive in that sense
let me know if you have any ideas and I
would be happy to do that because I did
I had a lot of fun with it I just some
kind of blanking on what to do next I
was so excited to film this video then I
totally forgot that I wanted to wear
these colored contacts in here so I just
pop these in these are from Dez Neil
I believe is how you pronounce that
they're the creamy beige contacts I've
been wanting to try them out but I
really do like my eye color so I've
noticed that every time I do a makeup
look and then I go to put the contacts
and I'm like ooh but I like
this makeup look makes my eyes look type
of thing and so I was like I need to
just do it when I'm actually going to be
filling my makeup so that so that way I
can just see like the end result with
them in it so I just went ahead and
popped them and I did get these sent to
me from actally and I don't I don't feel
like they changed my eye look all that
much it kind of made them a little bit
more bluer and a little lighter but I
can tell that they're really bothering
my eyes so I'm not sure I'm gonna be
able to keep them in the whole time I
can just tell that they're irritating me
I got LASIK about eight years ago but I
used to wear contacts on a daily basis
they were a little bit challenging to
put in like they're kind of like floppy
I would say but I've always wanted to
try color contacts like since high
school because a girl on my cheerleading
squad had color contacts and I thought
they were the coolest thing but I don't
know I liked that they did change my
eyes too much because like I said I do
like my eye color so that's why I wanted
to pick again I picked creamy beige
because I didn't think it would change
it too much but I don't notice a huge
difference with them but we'll see if I
can make it laughs throughout this
tutorial but I might have to pop them
out because they're kind of irritating
me but has anyone else tried colored
contacts oh man I'm just such a hot mess
I was so excited about this but I was
like paint I really need to try those
contacts out and see how I like them
okay so moving on I have blush what do
we got here luminoso from Milani one
with 65% not really surprised to see
Luminoso win because a lot of people
really do like this blush so it's a
really beautiful peachy shimmery blush
so I'm just gonna go ahead and apply
like I feel like I can even notice like
redness and irritation but it's kind of
like big I don't know how to explain it
when I took the contacts out I was like
who are these even gonna like fit in my
eye like I wanted to try them out so I
don't know maybe my eyes just need to
get used to having contacts and again
it's been a while okay one more item for
the face so for highlight with 65% the
winner was the essence appear nude
highlight I was a little surprised by
this because this is known to be a more
subtle kind of just glow from within a
type of highlight but I was pretty
excited to see it because it is one of
my favorite drugstore highlights I
recently did a collab video with my
friend Kim here on YouTube and we were
testing out each other's drugstore
favorites
and so we sent each other a list of our
faiths and this is the highlights that
she chose for her video if you use a
more dense brush like the Sigma fo three
which is one of my favorite highlight
brushes it packs a bit more of a punch
versus like a loser like fluffier brush
so that's typically what I still will
grab and then I just I just build it up
a little bit until I get it to the
intensity that I want but you can
definitely be you know more light handed
with this highlight and it'll give you
more of a subtle glow but I do outside
Mary lights on so keep that in mind but
oh that's pretty
and then I'm kind of a dumps because I
totally forgot that I had eye primer as
a category and I put concealer on so I'm
just gonna put a little bit i prime
around still with 72% of the votes it
was the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion and I have mine in original I
know a lot of people really like this
one a lot of people are excited to see
these on sale during the Ulta 21 days of
beauty so I'm just gonna go ahead and
add a little bit here to prime my eyes
the eyeshadow palette scible is one of
the closest categories but the winner at
57% was the coloured raine queen of
hearts i shadow palette this just feed
out the color pop all I see is magic so
I'm going to be using this palette today
and I know I haven't shared with you yet
like the eyeliner or the lipstick but
I'm trying to figure out how to make
this look match up with everything that
one and I'm having I'm having a little
bit of a difficult time with this but um
let's just see I'm gonna use air first
and just put this all over the lid and
then I'm gonna go for a bronzy look so I
want to use the your majesty so first
I'm gonna come in with royal prerogative
with a blending brush and put that one
into the crease you know I can't say I
was surprised to see this as the winner
I mean I wouldn't have been surprised
either wieck's I feel like those are
both like pretty loved palettes but I
know the hype is still very real with
this coloured raine palette I'm gonna
come in with a smaller blending brush
and pick up this darker Brown here in
Duchess and just kind of focus this on
the outer part of the eye and I'm going
to pick up this bronze e shade the your
majesty was just a flat shader brush and
I did go ahead and spray my brush these
are really good shadows but
typically with any shimmers I do like to
use a damp brush and look how beautiful
that gold is oh I think just a little
bit of Fallout underneath my eyes so I'm
just gonna kind of carefully wipe that
away after I get done typically I would
do my eyes first especially when working
with you know shimmers or things like
that but I wanted to kind of do it in
the order that I was doing the whole
March Madness series but I love this
bronzy it's like hobbsy gold beautiful
shade who a think that looks really nice
so I'm gonna do eyeliner before I finish
off my eyes and with a 64 percent of the
votes
was the Urban Decay 24/7 glide on pencil
in deep end so this is what I was saying
I wasn't sure how to match that I like
with the liner with the lip color I'm
like oh boy so I didn't really feel like
there was any shades in that palette and
the color green palette that would go
with this so we're just gonna have to
make it work you love deep end it's one
of my favorite colors I love the Urban
Decay 24/7 glide-on pencils they're so
easy to apply so yeah we're just we're
just gonna go ahead and roll with this
just to finish off the lower lash line
quickly all I'm gonna do is take the two
Browns so royal privative a and Dutchess
I'm just gonna use the pencil brush and
smudge them onto the lower lash line and
then for the inner corner highlight I'm
gonna grab a little bit of crown with a
smaller pencil brush and I'm just gonna
pop this right into that inner corner I
am gonna go ahead and do my brows off
camera because my camera is about to
overheat and it just takes me a while to
do my brows and I know this video it's
gonna be longer anyways but I'm gonna
use it the benefit precisely my brow
pencil this one with 52% so again very
very close category for the brows but
the speed out the Maybelline eye brow
definer so I will be right back
alright so my brows are done I would go
ahead and do mascara before I put lashes
on so with 68% of the votes was the
Maybelline total a temptation mascara
this is one of my new favorite mascaras
so I'm just gonna go ahead and apply
this and I decided that I actually don't
hate the blue with the bronze feel like
I hate that color combination actually
so like I said I would show the look
what it looks like with mascara and then
I will also do lashes so here is what
the look looks like with
two coats of the Maybelline and total
temptation mascara for the lashes if you
remember from round two I actually had
one that had the highest percentage and
then the other two actually were a tie
so we had three different categories for
lashes and it was still really close but
winning with 47% of the votes was the
hooter beauty as Samantha lashes so it's
kind of surprised to see this and I
actually just wore these the day before
I'm filming with this video so they're
nice and trimmed and ready for me to
apply I'm not gonna do any top liner
which a lot of times I do with the hooda
lashes but we'll just go ahead and see
how it looks with no liner because at
the time that I was getting the March
Madness videos ready which was like the
end of January or something I basically
had like one liquid liner and that was
it so that's why I didn't do that
category now I have a few more but at
the time I really didn't have any to do
an actual like four category poll for it
is there like some of my like staples
for the longest time they are expensive
the other like $20 per lash pair of
course but they're they're pricey but I
warmed the other day and I was like ah
still do like these lashes they still do
look pretty but they're just so pricey
and there's other lashes that I really
do like that are like half the price I
don't know I might just always have
who'da Samantha in my collection there
once the lash adhesive is tacky I just
come in from the top and then secure the
middle first and then work on the
corners already so I have the hooter
Samantha lashes both on again I just
prefer these with a winged liner to hide
the band a little bit better but that's
okay that's what we're going with for
this video but so the eyes are complete
and then moving on to the lip color the
the winner that was a terrible drumroll
let's never do that again
the winner is the color pop and I love
Sarah E
Ariba lipstick so this one with what did
it win with 62% that was pretty good
over the Mac age sex location which is
probably a good thing because I still
can't find that lipstick and someone
told me today that they couldn't find it
at Mac and they thought maybe it'd been
discontinued I hope that's not true cuz
that makes me very sad but this is why I
was saying with the color green queen
aha
and then the blue eyeliner and then the
red lip I was like how is this look
gonna turn out but I'm gonna go ahead
and apply this this is one of my
favourite red lipsticks nice and
affordable mmm so pretty so here is the
color pop of Reba lipstick so the only
thing left to do now is to spray my face
and the mac fix+ was the winner with a
66% I love the setting spray it's also
in my 18 and 2018 project pan so thank
you guys try and help me out all righty
so here is the a final look for my March
Madness finale video letting you guys
choose my makeup what do you think of
the makeup look that I tried to create
from all of those different choices I
think it came out pretty good better
than that's I thought but I was really
worried about it matching okay but I
think it came out pretty good but let me
know what you guys think of the look let
me know what you thought about all of
the winners and the categories did any
of them surprise you I would love to
know thank you guys so much for making
the March Madness a serious a success
