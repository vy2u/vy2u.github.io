hey guys thank you for watching so
today's video I'm going to be taking the
highlighter challenge that has suddenly
become very popular here on YouTube I
guess it all started with a girl who I
believe her name is Maria from Dubai she
put out a video doing her whole face
only using highlighters and it caught on
like that and now everybody is doing it
and at first I was like that's pretty
silly I don't need to do that and then
more if you'll started doing it sounds
like that actually kind of looks like
fun because it's just something that's
like silly and light-hearted and in good
humour and I'm like I could maybe do
that right and then I thought about
smart I was like well I just bought an
Anasazi aglow kit i just bought the
jaclyn hill and becca cosmetics face
glow palette like I have so many
highlighters right now I went from not
even knowing what highlighting my face
was to getting on YouTube and being
obsessed with highlighters and just like
buying so many different highlighters so
I'm like I'm just gonna pull out all of
my different highlighters and see if I
can do it and see what it's all about
and just make my face glow like a light
bulb / a tin man you know truly have no
idea how this is going to go I decided
late last night that I was like maybe
I'll do it if I feel up to it in the
morning and then this morning I was like
let's do it I just pulled out all of my
different highlighters really have no
idea yet what this look is good to look
like turn out like I just grabbed
everything it was like let's see what I
can come up with off the top of my head
no idea how this is going to go but I'm
up for a challenge let's try it out
let's see how we do okay stop stalling
if you would like to see my whole face
highlighter challenge makeup look please
keep watching I'm going to prime my face
I'm going to use the Becca backlight
priming filter because this helps give
the skin a luminous glow okay oh ro do
them and I put so much on
okay like much more horses than needed
but hey I mean I guess if there's any
time to use too much of a luminizing
primers for the highlight challenge
right maybe that's my like subconscious
telling me to do it that way I used just
like a little dab to give me like a nice
natural glow a luxe i dinna that's not
what we're going for here today then for
my foundation I was going to use the
like like the l'oreal lumi or one of my
Leumi foundations and then I found this
in my collection is from steel is that
illuminating to dip moisturizer so
technically you know it's not like
really foundation but I'm not really
concerned with that at this point and I
remember wearing this quite a bit last
summer and really liking it so I don't
know we'll see what it looks like on
mama people's videos for this challenge
are just like straight cracking me up
they are hilarious and this Mario I'm
like she's got to just be like patting
herself on the back like way to come up
with a hilarious trending topic
hilarious ok so then to set everything I
was kind of worried about this park
sounds like I really don't have anything
like a loose highlighter type of thing
that other people are using I do have
the laura mercier secret brightening
powder but I was like I truly don't
think that's like highlighter material
so what I think i'm going to do I have
champagne pop from Jacqueline hell Beca
cosmetic but this is like broken into
little tiny pieces so it's kind of like
a loose highlighter so I'm just going to
dust this all over my face and see what
looks like i have no idea this is going
to work out but i'm gonna try it so i'm
going to take a real techniques that's
our blush brush and it's just like one
of my like bigger brushes i'm going to
dip this into my poor little shuddered
champagne pop
and then put that on my face oh my god
this is weird I never thought I'd be
using champagne pop for this reason but
you know who doesn't need a champagne
pop to set your foundation I mean am i
right how am I looking Oh dougie can we
tell it on there's like the side versus
the side can you see a difference yet I
don't know I mean hey at least I can say
my broken champagne pop cubed handy for
something you know and such the forehead
oh yes I am hmm I am looking amazing
right now my biggest fear right now is
like the UPS man coming to the door the
mailman like dropping off the package
and I'm going to answer it like oh look
would be embarrassing I feel like that
would be more embarrassing than less
your Luck's talking about how she always
looks like crap in the UPS victim like
I'm gonna look like a distal off so
legit like when I look in my mirror here
I feel like I just look like crazy
freakin glowy but when i'm looking in
like the viewfinder on the camera like i
don't feel like i see it that much so I
just keep adding more but I'm like I
don't know he's just because the view
friends are so small and maybe once i
actually edit I feel like I look super
glowy right now I feel like I do so I'm
going to move on to eyes for a hot
minute I'm going to use the carli bybel
and bh cosmetics palette because they
have these four high lighter shades at
the bottom and so let's see I think
maybe for like my crease color I'm going
to go ahead and you
use this one right here so I'm going to
take my morphe m4 33 and pump it into my
crease oh I forgot to prime my eyes but
that's ok and I'll be probably wearing
this look out to dinner or anything my
husband might be terrified this is just
a really nice like shimmery bronze color
so I'm just going to play now over into
crease being a little sloppy with it
because we can be this just makes me so
curious like what is the next like funny
trend thing gonna be here at YouTube
look who can predict what's going to be
I don't think it I don't know why I
didn't think of the highlighter
challenge I mean I'm sure that's what
everyone is saying but because of like
just how obsessed with or out all are
with highlighters these days like how
don't this not even get saw the flip
sooner then for my lid color I'm just
going to take the shade that's right
next to it this like lighter one right
here and I'm going to take my sigma e 54
brush and just push that across the lid
kind of merge the two together I don't
feel like I would normally do this
combination for an eye look but again
I'm just going to be all about the
highlighted to look forward the eyes as
well for the lower lash line I'm going
to take this really dark bronze color
and my morphe e36 and just run that
along the lower lash line
finish the eyes off in a little bit
honestly I'm not really very concerned
with the eyes i think i'm just going to
do some inner corner highlight of
mascara and be finished with the eyes
but i'm going to finish off the face i'm
going to go into the Anasazi Oslo kit
palette in that glow and they use golden
bronze I'm going to use that of the
bronzer I don't know if I've actually
used this color before but I'm just
going to shimmer bronze up my face I
just feel like I look Oh silly right now
this is working out well as a as a
browser I mean yeah I think that looks
pretty good hit forehead a little are
just because you know this look is not
about excess or anything wonder like if
I went to the mail right now many of my
neighbors were out like what they would
think of me what they actually thinks me
so for blush I'm going to go into the
Jackson Hale Becca cosmetics face glow
palette and I'm going to grab Rose a
spritz which is right here it's a
luminous blush but honestly like it's
just to me in my mind it's a bomb
highlighter like can you see that I mean
I do like to mix Rose a spritz and
champagne pop I just never quite thought
it would be in this manner I have become
obsessed with rose i spritz oh my
goodness I do it's like I mean it's just
like a blush and highlighter I would one
and it's just freaking beautiful then
for highlight I'm gonna grab Prosecco
pop from the same palette and my morphe
am 501 and just do things to my face
just continue to get that nice highlight
it look going in case in case we missed
any spots i'll just go over that with
Prosecco pop you know no big deal
gotta get down your nose bridge your
nose mm-hmm cupids bow never forget the
Cupid's bow gotta get the chin mm-hmm
mm-hmm can't forget the chin okay right
I mean I wasn't really can adjust on the
fly but you know I carry Oh to go back
my eyes I'm going to use the colour-pop
get paid it's like a metallic liner I'm
just going to run this like on the lower
lash line as well and then also in the
water line just for like a little bit of
a metallic rose gold pop I feel like it
much as well what's the high lighter
shades that I chose to the eye shadow
today just gives it a little bit extra
light my inner corners I'm going to go
back in with the Anasazi aglow kids and
come in with fun first and my morphe e18
going to highlight the inner corners
ok so I shall I didn't mean to do this
but I started to like bring that down
like here and can you see this is like
highlight warrior you can see that I'm
gonna keep it going because that's just
funny to me highlight warrior could be
like a Halloween costume what are you
the serum a highlight warrior totally to
finish off the eyes i'm just going to
come in with the benefit roller lash
mascara i'm not going to do any lashes
because you know it's just all about the
face i feel like we don't need lashes
and benefit was so kind and just sent me
this mascara and i've been dying to try
it out so just going to do lots of
mascara Lusa fun wand this look is
almost complete for lips i'm going to go
in with a gloss because i feel like this
look needs something velocity i'm going
to be using from Kylie cosmetics her lip
gloss and so cute it's just a really
light gloss
so I do like the philosophy love but I
don't I don't know what I'm going to do
here but I'm gonna take from Becca
cosmetics and oval just like a tiny bit
like on my pinky like DAP that over no
this is actually gonna do anything but I
brought opal out I want to use opal and
put it I'm putting opal legs in the
center of my lips I don't know that if
that made any sort of difference but I'm
going to pretend like it did I just
wanted to put highlighter on my lips as
well you can't judge me on this one Oh
guys and this is going to be my finished
look so this is what I came up with for
the full face highlighter challenge what
do you guys think do you like it oh my
word this is the most different things
that I feel like I've ever done really
was trying to get creative with the
festival look but this just takes it to
a whole nother level and I'm not mad
about it alright guys so this is my
finished full face highlighter look I

video again of course this video is all
in good humor just some light-hearted
fun just playing with makeup and
hopefully I've been seeing like some

nice face mask on and try to make my
face like me again after I just piled
high lighter all over it hope you guys
