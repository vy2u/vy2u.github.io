I'm excited for today's video because
I'm finally going to partake in another
makeup challenge video so these makeup
challenges have gotten a little bit out
of control on YouTube lately it was
maybe like a month ago or something it
was a while back I did the full face
using only highlighters challenge and
that was fun it didn't leave my skin
feeling great it was fun I didn't like
what it did in my skin I did break out
after it which I figured was coming but
then after that I mean the full face
using only liquid lipsticks came out I
seen a full face using only crayons come
out face using kids make up all of a
sudden I'm seeing a hundred layers of
makeup 200 layers of makeup 1000 layers
of makeup and I'm like what's happening
here lovely wonderful friends on my
snapchat have been asking me are you
going to do that challenge are you can
do this challenge for challenge are you
going to do and I have a conversation
with them the other day because I was
like guys I want you to know that I
listened to you when I get video
recommendations I screenshot every
single one of them I put them into my
notes I take them into consideration up
if I can do it when I can do it and that
sort of thing and I was like I just want
to tell you guys that so far I don't see
anything that's really speaking to me
and I don't want to do something that I
don't want to do I don't want to make
videos that I don't want to do because
just for the sake of doing them or being
involved in a fun challenge like and
that's not what I want my channel to be
and I kind of went through some of them
like I was like I don't want to put
liquid lipsticks all over my face it
hurts to take liquid lipstick off my
lips and so to have them on my entire
face sounds very painful and then when
it came to the full face using kids make
up that was another one that was pretty
requested I was like okay I think that's
the one that I could do like that does
sound pretty fun right and then I looked
into the price of buying kids makeup and
that's not cheap because I kind of
thought you know it's kids makeup of
course it's going to be a less expensive
why I thought that I have no idea
because kids are expensive let's let's
be real so I thought okay so I'm gonna
have to spend literally like I was
putting stuff in my car and I was
getting closer and closer to a hundred
dollars and I'm like um no I'm going to
spend out
dollars on makeup that I'm going to use
one time and then have to throw away you
know what I have to be practical here
guys I'm I'm a very practical person i
like to think and so I was like I don't
think that one's going to work out
either and then the 100 layers of makeup
again I don't want to do it to my skin I
have very sensitive skin I broke out
after the highlighter challenge pretty
bad and I was like you know what um I
don't want to do that I don't want to
layer anything on my skin like that and
then I thought about doing the lashes
because I like lashes I'm gonna have to
go out and buy a hundred pairs of
eyelashes like no I don't want to do it
of course this is such a long intro but
I was telling my snapchat you know I
don't know what to do I'm listening to
you guys I know that you want to see a
challenge but I just don't see one that
I want to do yet i'm sorry i'm such a
practical and boring person so sorry but
that's just who I am and I'm not going
to pretend that I'm anybody else if I'm
not comfortable making a video I'm not
gonna make it it's just that simple so I
asked for like ideas and suggestions and
my snapchat came through not just with
challenges but video ideas in general a
couple people said they want to see like
because I talk about price because you
guys I'm not rich if you don't know my
full time job is an author and i also
own a publishing company and i will tell
you right now publishing is not where
the money's at hello boost I'll be
straight up with you guys I don't have a
ton of money to be able to spend on
makeup and when I do I think very
carefully about the purchases that i'm
going to make so to spend hundreds of
dollars on products just to be silly and
put them all over my face or to spend
hundreds of dollars on kids products i'm
going to use monson throw away it's just
not practical for me it's not what I'm
going to do so I had a lot of people
suggest you know like a ten-dollar
makeup challenge a five-dollar makeup
challenge things like that and I was
like okay now we're getting somewhere I
feel like maybe I could actually do
something like that I was through my
makeup collection and tried to find like
the cheapest items that I owned and see
like what could i do but even going
through my collection and finding like
blush and eyeliner and lashes mascara
like once you put the full face together
I mean it was like fifty dollars thirty
dollars twenty dollars like I was trying
to like whittle away things like what in
the heck
I do here and then i remembered that i
have seen dollar tree halls here in
YouTube and apparently you can go to the
dollar tree and they have makeup brands
there and each product is a dollar I
didn't even know that before I started
watching YouTube videos I thought okay
why not go into the dollar tree and see
what kind of makeup they have and see
what I can come up with can I do a full
face using only products that cost one
dollar so I don't know what I'm going to
call this video like the one dollar
makeup challenge because legit every
single product that i bought cost me one
dollar is my bag from the dollar tree so
i got a total of nine items in i spent
here's my receipt i spent nine dollars
and fifty four cents total i bought
everything that i think i need it they
didn't have primer there was no primer
there which I don't always use primer
cat sometimes I forget and they didn't
have any like regular highlighter there
was nothing there is like a highlight
which I don't use highlight always an
actor the full face highlighter
challenge I got a lot of texture and so
I kind of been backing off the highlight
anyways those were the only two things i
got foundation and concealer and
eyeshadow and liner and mascara there
was even lashes there it was amazing so
I'm gonna challenge myself to put
everything on my face see what kind of
full face look I can come up with going
to be only using these nine products so
I'm not going to use a Beauty Blender
I'm not going to use an extensive brush
some of the things like the eyeshadow
palette comes with a brush the blush and
the bronzer comes with like the own
little brush and the palette that's all
I'm going to be using nothing else this
is a nine dollar and 54 sent makeup
tutorial right here I want to say thank
you to my snapchat fam for giving me
this idea for understanding like my
certain limitations and the way my mind
works when it comes to these YouTube
challenges below you'll find this like
somewhat informative a little bit more
practical but still fun at the same time
and it's still a challenge because this
is going to be challenging especially
when you see some of the color
selections that I was forced to get it's
going to be interesting but here we go
one day I may go challenge let's get it
got nine products look I mentioned they
didn't have a primer so I'm just going
to start with foundation
this is from LA Colors it's their liquid
makeup so this is what it looks like so
the first thing that I noticed was that
with the makeup like yeah they have like
the different brands and such but they
do not have like shapes elections the
biggest thing I saw for shade selections
were lipsticks but like when it came to
this this is one of the only foundations
I could sign they had one shade tan I
mean I'm not super tan so I don't think
this is going to be a great color match
by any means but we're going to go ahead
and try it because there was no other
option they didn't have a lighter shade
or anything so it was the same with like
the blush the bronzer etc they had one
shade across the board so like okay so
your selection is very very limited
which was interesting but gonna go ahead
and apply this like I mentioned I wanted
this to be one dollar makeup challenge
I'm not using my twenty dollar beauty
blender or even like my six dollar
morphe brush or anything like that so
they didn't have any foundation brushes
so I'm just gonna have to use my fingers
which sometimes I use my fingers to
apply foundation like especially like BB
creams okay here's what it looks like a
load I have glitter on my face oh oh boy
okay well this is going to make us nice
and tan interesting because like when I
put it on my face it was very dark but
as I'm rubbing it in it's like getting
lighter which is weird also it doesn't
appear to be like sinking into my skin I
don't know what you would call that but
it's like sitting on top of my skin
which is weird and it's very orgy look
I'm going to look like a straight bowl
after this you look how orange that is
Oh Nelly okay look at this I don't know
if you guys can see that in the camera
but it's literally like peeling off my
skin okay so I'm definitely I was like
really wondering if I would find like
any gems in here but legit can you see
that you obviously the color match is
not a word
where it should be and that's because
they had one shade but literally like as
I'm moving it it's like it's literally
peeling off my skin that is so
disgusting whoa that's just so gross
look at that no no ok so the foundation
was an epic fail on every single level
like even if the color match did match
me the way it balls up on the face like
oh okay but we're going to keep going so
next is concealer this is from
wet'n'wild from the frig e collection so
all it says is celebrity concealer there
is no shade on here and there was like a
rack of them and they were all looked to
me to be exactly the same so this says
come correct celebrity concealer well
that kind of sounds dirty but ok so it's
from one wild and collab with Fergie it
says okay so it says it is medium beige
ha okay well why not we're just we're
just gonna go for it so again they
didn't have anything that would look
like a concealer brush so I'm just gonna
have to use my fingers again but why not
oh oh oh if you guys can tell but like
when I got some product out it's
literally like water okay so it comes
out like water and it literally looks
like it's like three different colors
this doesn't make any sense there's like
really light parts but then there's some
dark parts in there too like it looks
like i mixed two different concealers
together but actually forgot to like mix
them up oh oh it's so thick how does it
come out like water but it feels so
thick that doesn't make any sense okay
okay okay okay okay this is sign Oh too
much too much and I don't have a brush
Oh
seriously this feels so disgusting oh my
word this is so thick this could be a
foundation it would probably literally
be a better foundation match for me than
actual foundation that's on my face but
this is so thick how do I even blend
this in okay you guys I honestly like I
had high hopes for this challenge and I
was like this actually might be kind of
boring be oh my gosh yes I was like this
actually might be kind of like a boring
challenge why not use them as an eye
primer too so I'm like well it's just
gonna be like a regular makeup challenge
like yeah some of the color matching
might not be great but it's not going to
be like exciting to watch this is going
to be like the most epic fail of a
makeup challenge ever if you can tell
how it like accentuate my poor so I've
always had this like huge poor right
here and it just like and then I have
some on this side to like look at that
oh oh that it does not blend into the
skin how would one use this as an actual
concealer look at my pornos what's
Appetit I just want to wash my face so
bad do I not put some concealer down
here so I have some redness okay we got
some redness up here but I'm just going
to put the concealer all over my nose
because it's basically all over my nose
anyways so why not just try to like
blend it in with this crazy-looking
foundation you believe like how high of
hopes i had for this challenge I can't
believe that I thought about not doing
this because I thought it would be too
boring and be like any other makeup
tutorial and again I don't know if you
can tell but it's like balled up like if
you see that that's like balled up
product right there oh oh oh oh boy okay
so let's keep it rollin so next we're
gonna bronze up the skin a little bit
because um because that's what we're
gonna do in the shade bronze perfect
since with its own little brush so
that's what we're going to use two
bronze with so here's what it looks like
and it has its own little brush so let's
do
some let's do some bronzing because that
will probably help right I went like
this and it looked like there's a lot of
product on it so I snapped it off and
then basically all the product goes away
like this kitchen line oh no the brush
is already coming up brushes just the
brush is falling apart you guys a brush
is falling apart thought it would be
really interesting I only watched to
like Dollar Tree makeup challenges and
both people use like a Beauty Blender
one use like a Marc Jacobs brush and I
was like no I'm gonna use what they come
with or use my fingers or whatever like
I'm gonna try to really really make this
work okay I feel like that foundation is
like very luminous I feel like my skin
looks quite glowy or maybe it's just the
crazy coming through I don't know brush
is is not good does this brush is not
good and the bronzer really didn't go on
very well i mean i feel like i just did
100 layers brother just trying to get
any color to show so we rolled for three
guys r 0 for 3 keep it rollin okay so
next we're going to try blush so this is
another one from LA colors I like colors
like really like that was like the main
jam there so this is their powder blush
it does come with an applicator which is
it looks very similar to the other one
and this isn't toast it was the only
shade of blush that they had was toast
slush is doing the same thing put the
product on there like you can see a lot
right and then I tap it off and where
the product go the first thoughts is how
do you apply blush with a brush this
small and once again the bristles are
just going all over my face you see the
prism just like going everywhere to say
it but I think we're about to go over
for this is not going well I had really
high hopes for this guys down here
there's there's like crumbles of
foundation now mixed in with bristles
and then there's this line that I used
to have when I did makeup in high school
eyes
cause I don't think I can beat the space
anymore it kind of hurts and it's like
itchy like I keep itching my face like
haha and you just want to wash my face
so from color mates color mates I got
this eyeshadow palette in garden party
so here's what that looks like or a
natural look it's long wearing and it
blends easily but we don't have any
blending brushes so we're gonna see how
easy that claim is what's a little brush
that comes inside of it the whole
palette looks like let's see here it is
here all the different shades and it's
got it this double ended brush I'm going
to pick up the second shade right here
just a little brown one and kind of put
that into the crease use the concealer
on my eyelids as a primer which is
something that I do opt in and it is
creasing so bad but I mean hey it's
probably not the concealers fault
because I didn't set it right right it's
not terrible that was only two
applications and with a non blending
brush I mean wasn't too bad I'm going to
pick up this blue because it like
reminds me of a mermaid this one right
here okay we're gonna pick that one up
and put it all over the lid whoa did go
on like pretty intense but as I'm like
blending it out it's looking like it's
it's kind of losing its luster a little
bit but um this I don't feel like this
looks awful that looks pretty do I look
pretty like it's not even like super
crumbly it's really not this is there
bad this isn't bad you guys and for a
dollar you get all these shades that's
not bad so for liner we're gonna use
from elf cosmetics and this is their
liquid eyeliner and coffee so I'm
assuming this is like brown and this was
all they had as well here's what the
liquid liner looks like oh this is what
the tip looks like that is like super
super tiny oh my word I'm kind of
nervous hold on let me see and it moves
like it's super super flexible so this
might be really hard to make a wing I
typically like something that's a little
bit like firmer or stiffer
a shot looks to be like really brown
billy gets pretty pigmented it's a
little bit like kind of streaky that bad
it was a little difficult to do because
of how how like flexible the brushes the
second I is this is not bad for a dollar
for this liquid liner that's not bad
okay and as it's kind of like settling
in it's kind of losing a little bit of
its like umph color wise but not bad for
one dollar this is not bad I would use
this again maybe on like days where I
don't want to use like my more expensive
makeup but the elf liquid liner for one
dollar that's not bad that's not bad era
this is from LA Colors it just says
mascara and soft black ok here can you
see the creasing a minor eyes oh man so
looks like a pretty standard wand so
there's not a lot happening how much
happening there lie put some on the top
lashes even though there was false
lashes they're kind of doing some things
it's it wants to so the mascara also
like flu is already like flaking pretty
bad and it's up here as well on my eyes
so that is no good apologize if you can
hear my dog in the background she's
sitting across from me just snoring away
mascara I don't think was great I mean I
can see it a little bit it didn't really
make much of a difference and it's just
like I got it on my under eye over here
but on this side I didn't and it's
already pretty flaky in it transferred
up on the lid as well so no for the
mascara next we have lashes and these
look crazy so this is going to be great
so these are from wet and wild shredding
the fringe i think is what they're
called shredding the fringe here's what
they look like probably not anything
that i'd normally would gravitate
towards they look a little odd but I was
glad that they came with their own glue
too so I don't even have to use my
bloops I was like wait I can't use
lashes if I don't have the glue for it
came with it so here's the lashes we
have the glue it appears to be white
which I really don't like white eyelash
glue because I just think that you can
see it's okay I'm gonna have to trim
these a little bit because they look a
little long but I mean I have to trim
like every pair of lashes that I would
wear so if you didn't see my eyelash
video I do have one but I can show you a
quick demo of what I do I basically just
my word these are like oh these are so
thin I feel like I'm gonna break them so
I put the lashes on these are so these
are so thin how would I ok so i put the
lashes on like I normally would and see
how much I have to trim I'm just going
to trim I'm just going to trim because I
don't know what these lashes are doing
sticky adhesive to stick it to like the
container is underneath the lash band so
it doesn't come off I don't know I don't
know what to do it's actually it looks
to be very clear oh oh that's not good
oh jesus oh oh hi word so it came out as
a clear gel and it comes out super super
thick what is this it came out super
thick and I don't know if you guys can
see this you see that like dots of glue
it literally came out went on the lash
fell down the lash and plopped itself
into their does not this is not going to
be well I can't imagine this is going to
be well so I think I have some glue on
there so I'm going to wait a few seconds
and get a tacky and then i'll go ahead
and put it on and then move on to the
next lash i do not have high hopes for
this ok thank you so much too dry for a
little bits I don't think this is going
to go on that was like the glue like
clumped together right right there and I
can't get those lashes apart but but it
actually is actually on my lash
look so crazy bizarre this is completely
bizarre yeah like that side wasn't as
bad as the other side that was an
experience you guys that was an
experience I'm glad that we were able to
experience that together thing left to
go and that is lips picked up this gloss
it says it's a crystal lip gloss so
that's what it looks like I've never
seen these from Milani ever I was kind
of hoping I would see something like
something that I actually recognized
from the brand but that's okay is what
the packaging looks like okay it's nice
like I mean it's a lip gloss there's
some pigmentation but not a lot but I
mean it's a gloss it's not like a
lipstick it smells horrendous as sticky
as I thought it would be I mean it's a
little bit sticky but really stickiness
is not bad a little bit streaky like
some areas are more pink than others but
it's not bad it's not terrible it
doesn't look like super glossy I don't
think but it's not super sticky it's not
incredibly pigmented but it shouldn't be
it's a lip gloss it's not bad it's not
bad for one dollar like if you're in a
pinch and you need some lip gloss does
not bad get it through the one dollar
makeup challenge and this is the final
results what do you guys think I would
definitely not be able to go out in
public like this hello three out of nine
products worked for me the eyeshadow
palette the eyeliner and the lip gloss
so three out of nine it honestly cannot
wait to go wash my face because this
foundation it can sit like I cannot stop
itching my face I don't know what it's
doing and I just wanted off my skin
right away but I hope that you guys
enjoyed my one dollar makeup challenge
maybe you found it somewhat informative
maybe you didn't know makeup was at the
dollar tree while it is and now I've
reviewed a couple of products from you
told you what to stay away from and told
you what you can try out and a lot of
fun doing this challenge this was way
way way more my style than some of the
other challenges that are out there so
thank you so much to my snapchat family
for suggesting this to me
I had a lot of fun a shopping for this
it was a lot of fun and be it actually
turned out to be a lot different than I
expected I thought this would just be a
regular makeup tutorial I kind of
worried it might be boring but it turned
out to be actually a lot of fun you know
it was it was silly and it's
light-hearted but it's makeup it's all
good it can be washed off that's what
I'm about to do but hopefully this was
somewhat entertaining and maybe somewhat
of value to you guys I hope so but if
