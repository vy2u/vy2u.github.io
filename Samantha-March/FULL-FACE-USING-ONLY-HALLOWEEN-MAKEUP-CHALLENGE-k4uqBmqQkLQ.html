today's video is going to be an
interesting one I'm going to be taking
on a new full face makeup challenge and
this was actually a suggestion from one
of my subscribers and one of my past
videos she wrote in and said would you
do a full face like everyday look or
glam look
using only Halloween makeup and I was
like what okay so in the comment just
kind of stuck with me and I was like
what could I possibly do with this is
that even like a possibility and I was
at CVS the other day and I found these
little kits and I was like you know what
I'm gonna go for it so I found this kid
it has a bunch of different colors over
here it has glitter there are creams and
then I found these like little no mess
no fuss crayon makeup it has six
different colors of crayons and I was
like okay so like between these two I
feel like I could do something so the
goal the goal of this is that I'm gonna
try to make like a semi-normal look I
have no idea if it's gonna work out
because I've been staring at these
shades so hard like what could I use as
foundation but that's my goal is to try
to make somewhat of a normal look using
this Halloween makeup set I have no idea
how this is gonna work you guys and if
it looks like I just woke up it's
because I did I'm filming this right
away in the morning because obviously I
know I'm gonna have to probably wash
this off before I actually get up and go
anywhere so I don't know how this is
gonna work but I'm gonna try it
I'm giving 100% credit to my subscriber
if I haven't put in the screenshot yet
or a comment I will put it in here this
was her idea not my idea at the time
that I'm filming I haven't seen anyone
else doing it yet not saying it's not
out there other people haven't do it
haven't done it I just haven't seen it
myself personally yet I just thought it
was a fun idea but you definitely don't
want to take credit for it because
wasn't my idea so I just want to throw
that out there cuz I know people can get
kind of weird when people say these
challenges with our ideas I'm making no
claim to this idea I'm just gonna try to
execute it the best that I can so I'm
stalling because I'm nervous but let's
go ahead and jump into it tire like
messy office in the background but I am
pushed or right against my window
because it's not super bright outside so
I'm like I'm like one with the window
right now trying to get any sort of
lighting that I can but I'm just gonna
go ahead and start off with the face cuz
why not so I'm looking at this and it
was smells weird um well maybe I'll use
this as my foundation color yeah let's
do that okay so it comes with this
little sponge so that's that's what I'm
going to try to use to apply it I don't
really work with like creams a lot so I
have no idea how this is going to work
like I'm gonna try to use like the
applicators and stuff that are in here
but I don't know if that's like going to
work or not so I don't know I mean I
I'll attempt it at first but might have
to switch to a brush this smells
horrible oh my word it smells so bad
oh grow hopes it also feels it does it
feels super duper thick like whoa this
one it's no joke guys so if you can't
tell um this is obviously too too light
for my face but that's okay um so we're
gonna go with right now guys I gotta get
it all the way to my hairline you know
this does not fit on the face nicely at
all that's okay it's not the most even
coverage in the world but you know it's
a start
so I feel like this isn't a great start
for trying
to look normal but you know let's just
keep it rolling so I'm gonna try like
this shade right here it's actually kind
of like a pinkish shade it's not pure
white like it kind of looks on camera
I'm gonna try this one oh yeah it's
definitely more pink okay so I'm gonna
try that as my concealer and use the
other end of the sponge for it oh yeah
I'm like once you once you like get
through the top layer the bottom layer
is much more pink as well so let's just
give this a try
you're gonna blend very easily that's
for sure it's to bronze and in contour
I'm gonna take this really deep a brown
shade that totally is not not my shade
and one of these little brushes that has
like a paint brush on the one end so I'm
gonna go ahead and contour because this
is totally my shade oh dear I don't feel
like we're gonna get any sort of like a
normal look from this I don't I don't
know how we don't know how we're gonna
look normal here so let's see how it
blends out my skin feels awful like so
so awful but it's okay this is like also
the smallest little brush ever on this
thing so we might be here for a while
trying to work this contour in maybe
this could be like a Halloween idea like
beauty guru gone wrong or something you
know what I'm saying like Oh oh dear um
it's it's not not blending the best not
really uh I mean we're gonna have some
harsh we have some harsh lines let me
flip it over and try this little like
sponge guy on the other end
okay that's maybe blending a little bit
better I mean we're just we're gonna
have a really defined contour as all
we're just really going to make sure
everyone knows like hey we decided to
really up our contour game today yeah
that's all
so for blush I'm going to come into the
red I'm gonna grab another one of their
little applicator thingies and apply
some blush onto my cheekbones oh dear oh
boy
too much I think I put too much on oh
dear oh dear oh dear okay let's see how
the blending works I don't usually go
for a red blush I haven't done that in a
very long time but let's just see guys
we're not gonna look any sort of normal
and right now I'm totally challenging
you guys to this because holy buckets is
this ever interesting I'm going to look
like a clown with a fierce contour a
clown with the fierce contour cuz that'd
be a Halloween idea like where's this
going it's not blending it's just moving
everywhere like I'm trying to blend it
and it's like what you want me to go on
your nose okay no that's that's not what
I was going for here this is not going
well I'm really glad that I decided to
do this in the morning and not in the
afternoon because that's when like our
packages get delivered to the door and
such and I'm always like talking in the
mailman or the UPS guys I would not want
to answer the door like this so weird
too wise if you guys do this go with a
very light hand because once these
products are on there basically you
can't blend them out you just can't get
it it's just look at my load oh this is
not going well at all
so for that eyes I'm going to go into
the crayons I'm gonna pick up the blue
one because you know there's
like blue in my outfit so let's let's go
for it so I'm going to lightly oh these
like don't show up at all oh oh but to
self if you need like crayons for
Halloween these don't actually do
anything is this a joke okay so that's a
huge fail like how am I supposed to
finish my luck with this what that is
absolute crap this was like solid four
dollars my four dollars back
that's awful since those crayons are
absolute crap I just tried to wash off
these brushes it only comes with two of
them so I'm like well we'll see so I was
gonna go with the blue before so I'll
just go back into the blue now and see
what we can come up with using these
brushes I cannot believe those crayons
didn't work at all like not even a
little bit and like my eye actually
hurts from like because I started
pressing so hard just trying to get
anything to come out and nothing was
happening
so I'm gonna try to do like a casual
blend right here okay and same thing on
the other eye I feel like this one is
showing a lot more trying to get that
blue smokey eye mm-hmm okay blend it
into the crease as best as I can I go
into the black and attempt to do some
liner here the black isn't really
showing up and like when I oh there we
go
when I try to blend it it just kind of
moves a lot so that's not working
that's not working out the best you see
like when you try to move it it just
kind of like disappears so not the best
a liner in the world needless to say
this is like a total fail
of a challenge like I was not that I
expected to be able to like go out after
this by Eddy means or like thought it
was gonna look normal but I was hoping
it would be better than just straight
clown but that's all it is it's just
we're just straight clownin right now so
for lips I feel like we'll just do a
purple lip because why not
this look is already quite insane I
don't do purple lips very often so just
give ourselves a nice purple lip here I
hope other people do this because I want
to see what they're coming up with and
how they are working with this makeup
because it feels nasty it's hard to use
and I just want to know how other people
are gonna pull this off I'm very curious
I definitely challenge you guys to do
this and I hope you do a million times
better than me like I hope you do a
thousand trillion times better than I'm
doing really like not even going on the
lips level at all I just when you move
it like it just it just disappears so oh
my goodness you guys my lighting is
about shot and I feel like that's
probably for the better because what in
the actual world do I look like here and
thank you so much to my wonderful
subscriber for coming up with this idea
and even though I look absolutely insane
it was really interesting to try this
and it was fun I will put this down as a
complete fail like I thought about
trying to go into the glitter and doing
lashes and all of that but really
nothing is going to help this look this
isn't an everyday look this isn't a glam
look this is crazy
contoured clown look so this was
interesting to do it was a lot of fun
thank you for the idea if you guys are
watching them definitely tagging you to
try this do not pick up those crayons I
would just get like one makeup kit and
try to go with that because those crimes
were absolutely horrible if it wasn't
only four dollars I've marched back to
CVS and be like give me my money back so
this was a very difficult challenge I'm
sorry that I couldn't make it come out
any better maybe if I bought better
Halloween makeup I mean that entire kit
that I showed you was six dollars at CVS
so maybe if I went out and bought more
expensive makeup but for just something
that's like supposed to be fun and silly
I didn't want to invest too much money
in it because obviously that kit will be
thrown away after this but thank you
again so much for this idea it was just
fun to be able to do something a little
bit out of the box and another challenge
video had also been requested from me so
here it is here's my full face using
only Halloween makeup I hope you guys
enjoyed this and got a laugh out of it
obviously it's just all for fun and in
good humor I'm gonna go wash my face now
it's about to be pitch-black in my
office so I gotta go thank you guys so
much for watching please do give it a
thumbs up if you liked it if you have
any other challenge video ideas please
do leave them in the description box
below make sure you are subscribed

soon in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
