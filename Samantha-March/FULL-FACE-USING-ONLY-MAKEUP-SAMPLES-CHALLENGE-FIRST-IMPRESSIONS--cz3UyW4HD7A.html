today's video is going to be a full face
look using makeup Sampha oh my oh my oh
my I saw this video requests come in in
the comments of one of my videos and I
thought that could be a good idea and so
I went through my makeup collection all
my little sample bags that I get from
Sephora and Ulta and I think I have
everything here that I can create a full
look I'm pretty sure that I do and I'm
also extremely nervous about this
because I also tried to pull samples of
items that I've never tried before so I
can also be trying out new things and
I'm very I don't really know how this is
going to go so this should be
interesting
I'm very excited to try something new
though so if you would like to see me do
my full page with makeup using only
makeup samples why don't we go ahead and
get started all right so I'm going to
get started here so I have a lot of like
these types of samples like little cars
I just use deluxe sized samples - to use
as well for items that I can't find in
these little card guys but I think I'm
going to go ahead and start with the
face I'm pretty sure I only have like
one eyeshadow that I have as a sample so
I'm going to start with the face I'm
going to go ahead then you guys in and
get started
wow I also tried to braid my hair
because I'm having a bad hair day so I
braided it but then I got forward like
halfway through braiding and just sucked
so that's the kind of day that I'm
having if you guys were curious and now
I'm about to do my full face was all
samples and then I have to do a YouTube
live in like three hours because I'm
filming this on a Tuesday so this day
could be taking a very strange turn here
but for my primer I'm going to use this
from Becca cosmetics this is the first
light priming filter I think this is the
purple one so it's the purple primer and
I've always want to try it so they do
hear really good things about it it is
okay so I'm just going to squeeze a
little bit out here so I'll just come
and come in I don't know if this is like
a well-known video I know there's a lot
of like full face using you know and
beef jerky and stuff like that to apply
your makeup but I don't know if there's
a sample line if anyone's done it or
like if you know of any funny ones or
anything leave them in the comments so I
can check them out but I
someone requests in the comments and I
thought okay and that would be a really
fun idea because I'm that person who
always gets samples like I'm always like
yes maple sample sample sample and then
half the time like I don't use them or
they just kind of sit around I'm like
what are you doing like you so simple
I'm so bad at it I thought this could be
a really fun way to bust him out and try
some new products here so nothing's good
on the face it smells good mmm not bad
but before foundation a little nervous
how this is going to go I have this like
little sample card from Make Up For Ever
and then inside is four different shades
this is up there Ultra HD invisible
cover foundation so I think I'm going to
use movie this shade right here which is
why 315 so I'm going to go ahead and try
put that on my face like these
foundation things they just make me a
little nervous because of like am I
gonna be able to cover my full face
what's that I don't even know but no no
give it a shy feels like very liquidy
I've never tried this foundation before
I've never tried any of the Make Up For
Ever foundation so I'm curious to see
how this goes the new Sigma Beauty
brushes to blend it in this is the 3d HD
max kabuki I just got these but I've
heard even like totally obsessed with
using them so let me go ahead and use
this to blend it out oh the shape match
doesn't seem awful right away I mean I
do have my ring light on so that could
be kind of skewing things for me but
it's blending in really really easily
too I do these brushes I feel like I
said I just got them but I'm already way
obsessed with those thing of you to came
out with two new brushes from their
dimensional line I really like this
foundation actually then somebody else
tries to make up forever foundation and
how come you didn't tell me I like that
the Koala to new brushes from the
dimensional line I am a Sigma affiliate
and they did send them to me which I was
so shocked about if you follow me on
snapchat
I really didn't think I was getting up
because I'd seen people getting up
earlier so I just kind of thought you
know oh well I'm not getting them I had
him to my cart on the fridge showed up
in my house I was so excited but I
really am liking up so far and like I
said since I am an affiliate I actually
do have a discount code which always
really excites me it's just Samantha you
can get 10% off at the signal website so
digging these brushes or digging the
foundation - mmm that lets I feel like
it looks really nice on the skin maybe
now that I'm looking at myself in the
mirror kind of looks a little Taylor but
again it could be to the head my ring
light on but I like the way that it
feels on the skin I like the way it's
making my skin look okay okay okay
that's awesome for concealer I'm going
to use this from Tarte this is their
maracuja creaseless concealer so it
comes in this little card like this and
has a few different shades on it I think
I'm going to go with the fairly light
neutral the lightest one year because I
do like light under eyes I have never
tried this concealer from Tarte so I'm
curious and see what I think I feel like
I haven't really heard a lot about this
particular concealer comes in like this
little stack here nails so I'm just
going to put some on the back of my nail
and then tap it high on your eyes to
feel this really thick a grrr illiberal
Isaac so uh we'll just see how this goes
I'm just gonna try to like tap some of
the excess on other parts of my face I
think I might probably have used too
much but uh see how it was that use the
other new brush from Sigma this is the
curved kabuki you can see like the curve
to it I think it's pretty cool so I'm
just going to go ahead and blend this
out it is very very thick it feels very
like full coverage too but that might be
just because I used so much I'm going to
use it to pride my eyes too so it's like
I said I think I only have one eye
shadow so I wasn't worried about like a
lot of fallout or anything so yeah this
is definitely like way too much
concealer I'm going to figure out
what I can do and stir to turn to blend
everything in together because I'm going
to be looking real crazy it's also super
super super light it did not look this
light in the packaging so it kind of
take me a while to get this all blended
so I don't look like a clown so this is
very interesting so I just been taking
my time to blend that concealer in and
it's definitely like super super light
and so what I did then was took of the
foundation brush that I was using and
just kind of like blended everything
over to try to like blend it a little
bit better but I need to put some color
back into my face ASAP so I'm going to
be using this little sample guy of the
Chanel Soleil tan and it looks like this
inside so I'm just gonna put a little on
my finger and then Debit onto my face at
the sample in a social ah box and so
choise no longer around and I'm not
really even sure like what happened like
they just kind of like shut down they
bummed about because I thought it was a
cool idea you got samples of like
high-end makeup like this Chanel de tan
because this is like super expensive
one's own I'm just going to go ahead and
put a little on to my cheekbones and
then also a little bit on my forehead
just try get some color back into my
face because I feel like I've definitely
on vibes going on at the moment and then
I'm going to use the same like curved
kabuki brush and just blend that in and
try to add some more color and warmth
back to my face bronzer is really pretty
like it's very like natural-looking I
feel like I've used it a couple times
before out of my little sample die but I
really do like it I don't know if I
would buy the whole thing though because
it is really a sin I do like the next up
I have this powder bronzer this is from
NARS it's their bronzing powder
this is in the shade Laguna I believe it
is so this is what it looks like and we
have this little powder right here so
I'll go ahead and try it out I think I
hear a lot about NARS Laguna right I'm
not I don't not a big like NARS person I
don't have a lot from them so it's never
ever used one of their browsers but I'll
give it a try using my morphe and
five-30 I'm just going to have it a bit
and I know the Chanel is technically a
bronzer but I feel like I need all the
help I can get right now
was adding some color back to my face
after this crazy a concealer episode
alright so there is the NARS Laguna on
my cheeks as well oh I guess that looks
pretty good I feel like I kind of used
you know two bronzers so I don't notice
a huge difference with this bronzer but
I'm still like super whiter on the eyes
but you know what that's cool we're
gonna just we're just going to keep
rolling and hope for better things to
come because I feel like I'm looking
pretty crazy like why not try to look
crazy I'm going to do my brows and I'm
going to use the anna sophia beverly
hills dipbrow pomade I have no idea how
this is going to go and it says it's for
brunettes and Auburn's so I mean it's
really not even going to match me the
lightest shade is medium brown and I
feel like I would be more in like the
lighter shades but this is all I had for
brows and I'm really committed to this
challenge so that's what we're going to
do it comes with a little brush too I've
never used pomade on my brows ever so
that's going to be nice and interesting
you have to cite it for sure before I
start my life I'm just going to have to
wash my face and start over because I
can't imagine that's going well I
honestly didn't know this was brunette
brow pomade but you know what we're here
we're committed this is the one that I'm
going to be using else it's like a
little teeny tiny brush so I don't
everyone cross your fingers
it's a little prayer for me right now
because this gonna be interesting I have
no idea what I'm doing
I don't have no idea how to do a pomade
I literally just try to tap it off okay
so okay here we go okay so I'm just
going to start at the base of my brow
right what's up people do that is so
dark just going to keep going
so then I'm going to do some of these
like weird flicks towards the beginning
of my brows even though I feel like
there's no way this is going well thank
you doing more flicking motions towards
the front
oh we're gonna oh I give up oh my word
what is this stuff
this is terrifying this versus so hard
to hold I mean I'm sure this isn't the
brush that most people normally use but
Jesus brushes are doubled my eyebrows
are like black you guys you guys you
guys you guys this is hysterical I don't
know what to do from the front like I
tried to flick it up with people just
like casually do some flicks but it's
like it's like that's not gonna work so
uh can you slowly through pomade is that
allowed is that a thing that people do
because I need a spoolie someone give me
a sweep but have what even looks like a
little sample spoolie here I'm just
going to go ahead and try to spoolie
some of this product out and see what
happens I'm going to use a very firm
hand as well I don't feel like it's
doing any better
so um hmm okay I mean obviously the
color is like way too dark but even
still like I just feel like I just this
isn't this I don't know this is why I
don't use pomade but I've always wanted
to try the pomade but there's no way I'd
be able to because that's just like this
I've never had this result with a pencil
never ever ever so pomade is still just
not in the cards for me I feel like
that's what we're learning with the
single challenge well I think so many
things so this is going swimmingly my
camera overheated so I did my other brow
off-camera and I feel like this one
looks pretty good so I mean oh my I mean
definitely the pomades not for me at all
I mean it doesn't help that it's like
five times the shade that it should be
you know bedtimes darker but no we're
just going to keep rolling with it so
I'm going to move on to my eyes because
you know why not at this point finding
an eye shadow is actually really really
challenging the only eye shadow like
sample size that I have is this little
guy from NARS looks like this and it is
in the shade Himalaya and at first I was
going to put this all over my eyes even
though it's more of like a shimmer
shadow but whatever but what's what we
got going on like I'm just going to use
a Cruz shade and I just have to do it
this is actually a bronzer it's the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer this is
what it looks like I use my Sigma domed
blending brush the e43 and I'm going to
dust this into the crease just because
like I just I get a guide you and I
don't have a crease color and I mean I
can do it but you know all I tell my
anxiety is already through the roof
today doing this challenge so I'm just
going to go ahead and dust some of this
bronzer on to my eyes I really hope that
you guys are enjoying the sample
challenge I hope you guys are getting
some good laughs at it I hope that you
guys do it if you do the sample
challenge let me know hopefully you turn
out better than me
I mean it's not even like I was just
using samples as also using things you
know the majority of things I haven't
used before which made it obviously a
step challenging but I mean hey it's all
in just fun and it's so funny how like
people get riled up over like other
people's makeup and they really have
such issues with it and it's like you
know it's just makeup right it washes
off like I'm not going to panic not
panicking I'm going to grab this SL mist
glam brush with a fluffy crease brush of
the 2:18 I'm going to use this for the
NARS shadow and see what this shadow is
all about I think I've ever used up NARS
eyeshadow up especially pretty well I do
like that Sun this one I'll apply this
all over the crease like I said I was
just going to go and I just use only
this shadow but at last minute I decided
that I had to
and something else so actually like take
off this makeup well I mean I will take
off those makeup after I get done
filming this video and then like I said
I'm filming my live here in a couple
hours I might come back and use some of
the same products because some of them I
did like but I don't think I could go on
a lie of the looking like this like I
don't I don't think that that could
happen so I do like this eye shadow
looks really pretty for liner I have
this little sample of a Marc Jacobs
Highliner I have use these and I really
do like them but I didn't have a lot of
sample sizes of eyeliner and I just got
this one so I haven't actually used a
black shade yet I got like a 10 piece
sample thing from Sephora it was one of
their like weekly specials or whatever
and basically I just really wanted this
island I'm going to take my domed crease
brush or domed blending brush and just
kind of rope that underneath my eyes for
a little bit of shadow that has the
bronzer on it so this Tarte concealer
said it was their creaseless concealer
and like all I'm noticing is creasing
and I know that I probably used too much
of it but still like like really really
large creases on my under eyes I've
never really I don't feel like I've ever
really seen that so that's not very
attractive
then for mascara I didn't have any new
mascaras laying around some exchanged my
samples the Too Faced better than sex I
think this is almost gone so I should
probably just be working on using it up
anyways but if anybody take me serious
and right now like steps that's what I
want to know but the I finished oh we're
going to move back to the face so I have
this little card here this is from
hourglass it's their ambient lighting
powder and they have two different ones
I thought maybe I could do blush and
then highlight I don't know I've never
used these either so I kind of have no
idea what to expect but you know give it
a shot else could go wrong take my
morphe e4 and dip that into kind of like
the pinkish side and see
see what happens okay I can definitely
see a flush to my cheeks it's nothing
like super overpowering I don't think
but that looks pretty free I feel like
at you're really mixed things about the
hourglass ambient lighting like people
either really like them or people think
they do nothing but it looks nice as a
light blush to the cheeks and then I'm
going to try the other side as the
highlight taking my Alexi 5:22 I don't
really know if this is like a high light
shade but all the other highlights
samples that I had were of highlights
that I already own and what fun is that
am I right or am i right I thought that
giving a very like soft subtle highlight
to the face which again I mean that's
kind of what I figured just by looking
at this I'm sure I probably like using
it wrong this might be like one of those
like actual face powders not really like
a highlight powder but you know whatever
I mean I definitely have a little bit of
a ish glow going on nothing too crazy so
you know this would probably be a nice
like setting powder for the face if you
want like a glowy finish but nothing
like - like you're not trying to do the
full face highlight challenge so there's
that one
like what like why not right and then
finally to finish it all off I'm going
to add a little teeny tiny lipstick this
is from Burberry and it is in the shade
nude Wow
okay oh my gosh look at that like
adorable Burberry packaging on the
lipstick that's super cute so let's like
keep those little lips together
I mean hey at least I left out with a
nude lip right right I actually really
do like that lipstick I just try some of
the Burberry velvet lips and I like them
too this is more of like their regular
lipstick I would say love the color and
I think it looks really pretty on but
after we have the lipstick on that's
going to do it for my full face using
makeup samples
okay so that is going to do it for my
full face using only makeup samples
challenge I still have you a bit zoomed
in so you can see everything on my face
let me know what you think in the
comments down below please be kind
I feel like end result it's tied
together better than I thought it was
going to I still feel like the concealer
is way too white and like I still feel
like it's even just too thick around my
eyes not really totally digging it and
obviously my eyebrows are insane but
like what are you going to do about it
but I like the eyes I like the eye
shadow the rest of the face I thought
worked out really well I love that
foundation like this Chanel bronzer it's
just really expensive I don't know I
mean I've had that sample for a while so
I'm going to take me a while to get
through the entire sample before I have
to throw it away but I like it the NARS
Laguna powder I didn't like really
overwhelming but I thought it was fine
the hourglass ambient lighting I
actually did like the blush the
highlight is too subtle for me like the
Marc Jacobs liner
I like the Too Faced better than sex
mascara loving on this lipstick I'm
going to reapply this too and see also
how it lasts throughout the day it does
have a very intense bright orange to it
which I'm not loving but hopefully that
fades since I could just apply it and
then obviously I mean the brows I feel
like I feel like if I would at least
have a better shade match for the brows
maybe it wouldn't look as bad I mean
still I did not do a great job with the
pomade that's like a hundred percent
that was my first time ever using Iroh
pomade so I would like to point that out
but definitely like maybe if the shade
was a closer match to me it wouldn't
look as extreme but you know you know
you know I'm probably just going to keep
sticking with my eyebrow pencils because
that's just really where I'm most
comfortable at I'd love to know your
guys thoughts on my final look down
below of course this is just a challenge
this is in light heartedness and fun
hopefully you guys got a good laugh out
of it of course like I said it's makeup
we don't have to take this too seriously
or anything like that I have fun testing
out a few new products I've never tried
before I found a few items that I
actually really do like heard you guys
do the same whether you have a channel
or not go through some of your samples
maybe you'll find items that you realize
you really don't like or that you really
end up liking and maybe you'll even go
on to purchase both sides of them so if
you guys do have any other challenge of
videos or full face videos or anything
like that that you would like to see
please just leave me those comments I do
read and respond to all of them and
that's where I got the idea for this
video was from a comment so if you have
any other ones that you would want me to
do just leave them in the comments down
below but I am going to go wash my face
now and get ready for my YouTube life so
thank you guys so much for watching this
video I really hope that you enjoyed it
if you did make sure to give me a thumbs
up I hope that you also consider
subscribing for you go and I'll catch
you guys real soon in my next one right
solid
