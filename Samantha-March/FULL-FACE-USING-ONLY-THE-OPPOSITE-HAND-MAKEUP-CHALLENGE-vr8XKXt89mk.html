today's video is going to be a new
full-face makeup challenge video so the
other day I was just on my youtube and I
video popped up in my subscription box
from Myra touch of glam and she did a
full face using her opposite hand
meaning her non-dominant hand and
applied makeup on her face and I was
like I want to try that it sounds so
incredibly hard so I am right handed so
I will be trying to apply all of my
makeup using my left hand and my left
hand I can't do anything with this thing
like I mean I don't it's so crazy to me
how bad I am I using my left hand but
I'm terrible at it but I thought her
video which she actually did two months
ago for some reason it just popped up in
my feet to watch I was like why is this
coming so late but i'll leave her video
link down below i'm gonna take on the
challenge i'm gonna try it out i think
it's going to be super super challenging
if you are one of those people who are
ambidextrous and can use both hands
that's amazing and you rock give it a
try so once again i'm going to try to
apply all of my makeup on my face using
my non-dominant hand which will be my
left hand this is going to be a
challenge but why don't we go ahead and
hop into it okay i'm going to take my
maybelline fit me in 225 I'm going to
pour some of that on to a damp Beauty
Blender ok so I'm going to use my left
hand right yeah I'm doing this right
pour some on ok ok that's nothing well
it's gonna be hard to remember I feel
like even that was awkward that probably
looked awkward ok and then bounce it in
I feel like I'm I feel it it sounds
weird but I feel like I'm like smacking
my own face because I feel like I'm
doing it harder than I normally would
which like makes no sense to me but yeah
I mean this is this work it's not too
bad it just feels uncomfortable and like
i said i feel like i'm i'm using too
much force for some reason i don't i
don't know why but that part i wasn't
too bad and then I'm gonna grab my
better skin concealer from Maybelline
and apply this on my under eyes into the
center of my face so got it in my left
hand this feels wrong whoa this feels
weird okay okay let's find them that's
fine it just feels weird it just feels
like you're doing something wrong okay
good good I'm just mine all right that
wasn't bad it just felt strange did you
sell strange that was all so I'll grab
my Beauty Blender again got it in my
left hand and bounce it out I honestly I
kind of thought having like doing the
Beauty Blender would be like harder but
again I just seem to be going in with
more force than normal but it's really
it's not too bad it's really it's not
that bad besides besides there where I
just poked myself in the eye because I
don't have the best control over this
but but that's fine just gloss over that
part and I'm not gonna bake mostly
because I don't feel like this makeups
gonna stay on for a long time and I'm
almost out of my baking powder but I'm
just gonna grab my Rimmel stay matte and
um deluxe concealer brush from Real
Techniques and it's like when you have
to hold something like when you like
hold a pencil it just feels wrong like I
just feel like I don't know how to like
I feel like I don't know how to do this
why is this so hard but like the beauty
butter didn't seem that hard I just feel
like I'm I'm just feel like I'm awkward
like I'm awkwardly holding this brush
putting this to set the concealer and
then I always I bring my concealer onto
my eyelids toot for my eyelid primer so
I'm going to set that as well then I'm
going to bronze a bit i'm going to use
the Physicians Formula butter bronzer
and my morphe m530 it's so fun it like
the thing that I realize doesn't going
through this is that I'm just so much
slower like I'm just I'm slow because I
don't feel like I'm holding this right
quad yeah this feels weird this feels
wrong it the one thing that I'll say
like how it feels is it that it feels
like I don't have control over it like
that's not that's not how you why is it
so different okay I feel like I look
awkward we'll go to look strange weird
how like how harder it's seeming to be
to do the right side of my face with my
left hand like I feel like this is a
real real challenge over here I
definitely want to tell you guys to do
this challenge because I think it's hard
maybe you're someone who maybe you're
not quite like a switch hitter but you
can still do okay with your non-dominant
hand like I'm just someone who like
cannot do my non-dominant hand like I
did baton twirling when I was younger
like I was in a class her baton-twirling
and they tried to teach us how to do it
on like our left side to like they
weren't you to be able to troll the
baton both hands no look I went to my
mom and I was like I want to quit I
can't I drop the patara every time this
isn't fair this isn't fun okay and then
for blush I'm going to use a dulce pink
and this is from Milani it's just a nice
pink color I'm going to use a more feet
m for 27 and for some reason like
tapping off brushes is very difficult
with my left hand I don't know what
that's about but I'm having a difficult
time chopping off my brush okay
and I feel like I'm making weird fate
like I'm looking in the mirror I'm
making weird faces and I don't know why
that is like look normal ok feel like
that wasn't too bad for some reason I
feel like that's heavy-handed but we're
going a little bright with the blush
today but that's fine but then here
comes the right side and I'm I can't do
the right side as well hey I feel like I
don't have control over the brush this
is just so weird there's blush it's a
little bright but but that's fine that's
cool that's totally fine um that's done
that's gonna be done with my face for
right now now I'm going to move on to
the eyes which I feel like it's going to
be the most challenging part oh yes ok
so I'm gonna try to do my brows next I'm
going to use my Maybelline brow drama in
blonde so I'm really trying to go above
and beyond like I'm trying to even open
everything with my left hand that's not
easy in my left hand now this I feel
like is going to be really hard because
like I keep saying I feel like I don't
have any control over what I'm doing if
you guys are new to my channel welcome
my name is Samantha my post videos
usually between three and five times a
week because i'm crazy i do have a
giveaway going on right now i'll link it
down below celebrating a book release
with like a huge holiday giveaway but if
you're all so new to my channel you
don't know that i actually hate doing
browse i just i think it's crazy and i
think one of the reasons why i really
hate it is because i get so much hate on
my eyebrows like when i first started
youtube I would never do them and like
the comments people gave me we're just
insane and then I try to do them but I
don't do them good enough and the people
are so mean that it's just completely
turned me off for my brows so I do have
the benefit goof proof pencil which I
like but I like using these like eyebrow
mascara type things just sign because I
think it's easier and I think people
need to calm down about brows but you
know that's just my personal opinion no
one's and one listen to me so this is
really hard again the right my right
side is so hard to do with my left hand
talk to myself in the eye again like
doing my brows was making me really
scared so I'm like going in so light
handed I don't even know if they're
gonna be able to tell a difference but
I've tried I tried I don't know if you
can see a difference there but I gave it
a give it a shot ok so for the eyes I'm
gonna go into my anastacio Beverly Hills
eyeshadow quad that i have and i think
i'm going to go in what should i do i
think i'm going to go in with birkin
first and my morphe m43 3 i'm going to
place that into the crease like I just
feel like I'm awkward even like even
this part and then I don't know why
tapping with my left hand is so freaking
hard but it is place this into the
crease ok that's not too bad this isn't
feeling I mean it feels weird and wrong
but it doesn't it's not horrible yet
liner is what's really scaring me and
mascara we'll see how that goes but ok
again I can't I can't tap off ok so that
one's not going so bad but let me try
the right side now the side that gives
me troubles like do you guys know how to
hold chopsticks and like when you're
trying to learn how to hold chopsticks
and you're like this isn't right that's
what I feel like and now I still don't
know how to use chopsticks let's be
serious I had sushi last night and I
always have to be the one that's like
right no no no a little chopsticks I
have to say as of right now I don't feel
like I'm doing that bad I mean it's
challenging go next I'm going to pick up
a little bit of pink champagne I've said
it before that i'm pretty sure i have
like a dud pink champagne I don't know
that's what I'm going to use it for this
challenge because I don't reach for it a
lot because I don't think it's great I
don't know everybody loves pink
champagne for my Nastasia and I'm like I
get a bad one but I just have like a
flat shader brush from bh i'm going to
apply this all over the lid
I think holding the brush like more
towards the end is really helping
because that helps give more control
obviously I mean I should know that and
I can't tap off so I what I'm going to
keep doing but yeah I feel like that's
that's that's helping okay and then for
the most challenging side I can't wait
to watch the playback of this video and
see all of my awkward phases like I feel
like I'm making a lot of them but that's
okay that's what happens I like poke
myself so hard ah ah that hurt and I'll
come back with my morphe brush and try
to blend and I feel like I keeps did you
to see me like I keep sticking my tongue
out I don't what is that why do I you
sticking my tongue out that's weird I
don't feel like that's what I normally
do when I'm like concentrating but I
don't know okay that's good that's yeah
that's good enough of a blunt that's
good that's good enough ok so for liner
I'm going to grab my Maybelline master
precise I really need to get new
eyeliners if you guys have eyeliner
suggestions let me know because i feel
like i use the same to all the time so
it got my liner and i'm going to try to
make a wink this is the part this is the
part that has me the most scared because
I mean I can barely do eyeliner anyways
and now i'm going to try to do with my
left hand like okay I probably won't
really be able to talk
I'm holding my breath
so so far I think we're doing ok button
let's try the actual wig now ok it's not
the best but ok then i'm going to try
bring it back
that is not bad that is not bad that is
not bad are you kidding me sometimes I
do worse using my right hand that is
crazy no no way no way let me zoom you I
mizzou meulen I mean can you see I
haven't sold it in yet I just extended
it and then brought it back but that's
not bad right right give me some credit
here I'm new at wings in general not bad
you guys I am stoked but now we're gonna
do the right side that's going to be
hard I am seriously I'm impressed I'm
impressed with that but this I in
general is easier to do my wing this I
is not as easy and the right side has
been giving me a hard time so this one
is probably not going to be as good but
I'm gonna give it a try and now I feel
like I'm going in like two confident now
I'm too confident now but this just
feels wrong right I don't I gotta like
twist my arm funny why why is this
happening why why is doing my right side
this difficult it's weird oh yeah this
one this is so much harder oh lord this
is so much harder if you guys could see
me this is what my arms look like and
then I'm holding the mirror this side is
so much harder I don't know what that I
don't know how to get down in here ah ok
that doesn't look bad ok and then i'm
going to try bring it back because that
wasn't that wasn't that wasn't as good
as the other one but ok the other side
definitely didn't go as well but it's
still not as bad as I honestly expected
it to be like I mean that one's not
great I know I get I'd like I know I get
it it's not great but it's not as bad as
I thought it would be it's really not
okay we're gonna keep going with the I
so for my waterline I'm going to use my
Maybelline unstoppable in sapphire I
just feel like all I can see is my blush
like I just I just did all sorts of
things with that blush brush but this is
just a really pretty blue eyeliner it's
one that I don't reach for enough that's
why I grabbed it again I just feel like
I'm holding it so awkwardly okay so I'm
going to try to get this in my waterline
this is sky spooky okay here we go ah
yeah that's that's that's hard that was
hard now I gotta try the right side oh
man okay put some shadow on my lower
lashline I'm going to come back in and
just pick up some more broken with my
morphe g36 so okay tap I don't feel like
I'm getting any better at tapping
product off I don't feel like that's
improving at all feel like that side was
awful the next side definitely more of a
challenge but not that bad and now i'm
going to use mascara to prep my lashes
for false lashes because i'm super
curious to see how i do with false
lashes first we need some mascaras i'm
just using my Max Factor precise mascara
this part scares me too i'm not going to
lie this part do you see how I have to
use my right hand to help get it in my
left hand it's interesting how do you do
this I am making ridiculous faces this
is embarrassing
ya know so far I feel like I liner has
been the hardest honestly I thought the
waterline was harder than the winged
liner I'm not even kidding but mascara
is definitely after eyeliner so far this
is pretty difficult even on my left side
which has been my good side so here we
go on the right side it's not gonna be
easy okay it's hard because how I've
said repeatedly now that it feels like
you don't have as much control it's
almost like I feel like I don't know
where my lashes are like I don't know
how far to go that make any sense
because it sure doesn't to me so I mean
there's the I think I'm afraid that I'm
going to get too close and I'm gonna
poke myself in the eye I think that's
what it is let me try to flip the wand
and go in this way mmm that doesn't
really help that much to be honest ah ah
so for lashes I just picked up my dodo
lashes there's like d 105 I think it is
and then my house of lashes lash glue
sorry if you can hear my dog I just gave
her a toy she's like going crazy over it
honestly I think it's going to be really
hard to apply the lash glue with my left
hand I really do I think that's going to
be a challenge but let's just see so
this from house of lashes it's actually
like a brush I don't know if that will
be easier or harder okay that's not too
bad for some reason I was just picturing
that to be like super hard maybe it's
cuz of the brush maybe the brush is
making it easier I just haven't used
this house of lashes at he said in a
while so I thought that would use it
honestly guys we get down to the end of
this challenge I've been a lot better
than I thought I was going to do I'm not
gonna lie i had the envisioned in my
mind that I might have to like give up
at some point because I've always been
so bad with my left hand but like that's
my wing
eyeliner amazed me like I know it's not
great and it's not liking program worthy
but it's not bad so I don't know I'm
shocked I'm not gonna lie I am shocked
so if you thought about doing this
challenge and you thought maybe you
would fail miserably I say give it a try
because i thought i was gonna fail
miserably and this would just be like a
funny video but i doing a bad job i'm
sure some of you will disagree with me
in the comments but you know i don't
think i've codified job i'm going to use
my tweezers which makes me really
nervous because these tweezers are super
sharp but uh hopefully we do okay okay
got him on I don't know how to do this I
I can't I can't get him off my lash it
okay maybe i'll try is this way no
that's bad bad bad nope nope that
doesn't work either crap i knew lashes
were going to be a challenge but
ah okay they're kind of on they're not
in the right spot at all but oh this
takes the cake this takes the cake this
is the hardest but I'm also going in on
my right side first I've always been
going in on my left side first this is
my right side ah that was hard the
lashes they're not on the right spot
they're like way too far over but at
least they're on I think they're on Oh
me and I can't like get the inner corner
because I I can't get control of the
tweezers this is so hard I can't I don't
think I can do the inner corner with the
tweezers we'll try to do my fingers
inner corner isn't on you get on with my
fingers or the tweezer so dang it doubt
that part is a fail but other than that
I mean the lash is on so whatever it's
not that bad ok so I'm going to go ahead
and put the adhesive on and then we'll
try the left side hopefully that side
will be better that's been my better
side ready to try again left side here
we go
okay okay come on inner corner on no no
it's not on this is not on the tweezer
makes me so nervous because it's so
sharp that went on so much smoother it
looks right like hold on let me see me
wed like yeah can you see like this /
just looks crazy this one looks normal
crazy like not even attached on the
inner corner normal like what is what my
right side it was better that i started
the lashes on the right side because
then i didn't have too big of a head
going into it because i was really
nervous to apply the left eye lash but
that would not waste mother that i
thought it was but eyelashes take the
cake that was the hardest thing to do so
to finish it off I'm to come in with
some lips I'm using the NYX soft matte
lip cream in San Paulo this makes me
pretty nervous too because like I said
control is definitely an issue and with
lips you need to color on the line so
ooh
I'll just say I'm really over lining my
bottom lip it's nobody do well why I
picked one of my brightest pinks for
this cuz like you mess up you're really
gonna look like a clown okay bottom lip
wasn't so bad just try the top of God
maybe it wasn't I looked in the
viewfinder haha oh dear okay not so bad
Oh messed up that's okay we're just over
lining again right over the lips
definitely aren't great they're not
great but they're not like that bad
they're there just a little but just
slightly over lined in certain places
that doesn't match with other places but
I really just can't get over my right
eye lash and how wonky that looks oh I
didn't highlight hold on let me
highlight my highlight I'm gonna grab my
mary-lou manizer from the bomb and my
ELF small tapered brush and just
highlight reel quik almost forgot to do
that good still I still can't tap off no
no why that is and I feel like
highlights not going to be too bad
because you know even if you go
overboard it's totally fine like that's
just real life so yeah let's thank you
bad right side again a little bit harder
but hey not too shabby oh the nose isn't
great nose isn't great or a little crazy
on the nose but not too bad all right
okay so now I'm all highlighted so now
I'm officially done with the opposite
hand challenge and honestly I'm freaking
stoked you guys I can't even tell you
how proud I am of myself and you don't
why I feel like I have never had enough
confidence in my left hand now that's
what on trial in class must have really
liked done a number on me because that
was not that bad I was expecting a
complete and utter fail and we were just
gonna laugh our ways through this video
but i don't feel like i did bad like am
I saying it's great and fantastic no but
it's not that bad so I had a lot of fun
