hey everyone thank you for watching at
today's video is going to be my full
review on the new Jaclyn hill and more
feed the vault collection so I have the
four eyeshadow palettes here I will be
giving my thoughts on each one I will
also be doing some comparison swatches
to the original Jaclyn hill palette and
then also a few others in my collection
as well I did do a first impression
video with all four of these pallets at
last week on my channel I'll have it
linked down below if you haven't seen it
I did a look with each palette so you
get four different looks in that video
but as it was a first impression you
know I was saying that I would come back
to actually review everything after I've
tried all the shadows and all the
pallets on my eyes see how they all work
to see how they wear throughout the day
and all that good stuff so today's video
is going to be my full review I have a
lot to say so why don't we go ahead and
get started so just like in my first
video I'm just gonna go through each
palette and I'm just gonna go in the
same order as I did in last week's video
as well I will have time stamps down
below in case there's a palette that you
are most interested in I did that last
week's video too because I know this one
will probably be longer as well it kind
of happened to it with a ring the alarm
here this was one where I wasn't sure
when I saw the collection come out and I
did put this in a will I buy it video I
have already saved the collection but so
many people had wanted to hear me talk
about it in my will i buy it series but
I went ahead and did it I broke down my
thoughts of it and I also kind of put in
order what palettes I was most
interested in this was actually kind of
like the third palette that I was
interested in because this one to me was
kind of the most similar to the original
Jaclyn hill palette honestly this I
think is probably the palette that I'm
most impressed with out of all four of
the palettes and I'm surprised to say
that I felt like I wasn't working any
harder with this palette than I was in
the original Jaclyn hill palette you
need this palette though cuz like I said
I felt like it was pretty similar to the
original Jaclyn hill palette so I have
some notes here of shades that I thought
were gonna be similar amongst the two
palettes so one thing for sure when I
saw lolly I was like I know that color
is in the original Jaclyn hill palette
so I'm actually gonna swatch lolly
against the shade sissy in the Jaclyn
hill palette so this one here
is a lolly from ring the alarm x2 that
I'm going to swatch sissy from the
original Jaclyn hill palette these are
similar to one another but they are not
the same and I was surprised because I
honestly thought that they would be but
I'll swatch because a lot of people were
saying that they thought that the three
from the top row the Jaclyn hill palette
we're all really similar to lollies so I
just went ahead and swatched this one
here is a little lady and this one here
is faint so again we have lolly from the
new palette and then we have sissy
little lady and then faint so next up I
want to show you boom which is this
shade right there and I'm going to
compare it to a firework from the
original palette which is this shade
right here looking at them I thought the
two were fairly similar so boom is on
top here and then firework is on the
bottom boom to me is more of like a
bronzy shimmer where firework has more
of a red to it so again I didn't think
that those were exact dupes so next up I
want to show you a bomb-ass from the
ring the alarm palette and I wanted to
swatch that against cranapple which is
this one here in the original palette
when I saw a bomb-ass and ring the alarm
I was like I know I know that color is
in the original Jaclyn hill palette so
this one here is bomb ass and this one
here is cranapple from the Jaclyn hill
palette so again these two are really
not similar it is overcast today and
raining first day of summer that I'm
filming this so I do have my ring light
on but hopefully it's not gonna throw
him off too much but if you can see
bomb-ass is more of a brighter red and
then cranberry just kind of has that
deeper tone to it so once again I was
pretty for sure on both of these that
they were going to be exact dupes and I
was fairly surprised that they weren't I
wanted to show you siren from the new
palette and I wanted to swatch that next
to chip from the original palette I
thought that these two would be fairly
similar looking at them in the palette
but again they really are not siren is
on top there and it has
more red tones to it chip is on the
bottom and that one is more of a matte
brown red so those two I didn't think
we're super similar and then I was going
to swatch the purple from the palette
this one is called framed and then I was
going to swatch that one against soda
pop which is here in the original
palette way so on top we have framed and
then we have soda pop so these are both
kind of in like the purple family but
they are completely different purples
from one another comparing against the
two palettes I really didn't find a lot
of dupes for bring the alarm which
surprised me because when I was thinking
about what palettes I could swatch or
you know kind of compare in this video
to each of the palettes when I thought
of bring the alarm
this was the palette that I was thinking
of and I really couldn't find exact
dupes within the palette so again this
is the one that I've been most impressed
with quality wires to it that I think is
closest to quality amongst this palette
but one thing that I find very strange
with the collection is that I don't find
that to be very consistent amongst the
other palettes swing over to the second
palette that I tried this is the dark
magic palette so this is more of the
green palette as you can see this one I
was nervous for and when I talked about
in my will about video I said this was
one that I was on the fence about
because the colors inside really
intimidated me I struggled a bit doing
my makeup tutorial and not first
impressions video I mentioned that I
thought the green that I used which is
inside job I mentioned that I thought
that that one was looking for early
patchy on my eyes so that one was
tougher to work with overall once I got
done and I had my lashes on and I have
the shimmer added in there I liked it
the way that it looked
I liked the technique that I used kind
of the mermaid look with the wing as the
shadow instead of using like winged
liner it kind of had that effect with
the eye shadow I liked it but it was
hard to get to and in that video I
compared it to a look that I had done
previously that I'd been getting people
requesting me to do a tutorial with and
I had done that look with the color pop
and kathleenlights Dream Street palette
and I said that I thought
Kathleen lights and dream street palette
was easier to use and I still stand by
that I played around with that palette
also this week and kind of compared it
to this palette and I would still say if
you do have that palette they're not
exact dupes to one another but I don't
like if that those are the shades you're
kind of wanting to reach for on this
palette and maybe you already have the
dream Street palette I don't think that
you would need it because I actually do
think that dream Street is an easier
palette to work with so these are what
the two palettes will look like so I
mean you can see that they're definitely
not supposed to be like dupes for one
another I'll do a couple of swatches so
you can see the differences between them
I was just kind of going off that one
look that I did and I said I had an
easier time with this palette and I did
ocean is it's a very interesting color
and it's extremely hard to work with I
really haven't had very good luck with
that shade in general and I think kind
of overall for me with this palette
since it is mostly mad and it is mostly
darker mattes they're just harder to
work with and that's why I was on the
fence about this palette do you have to
say that a lot of the darker mattes
I do find to be fairly patchy busting
inside job and mojo especially they are
just not the easiest to work with so if
you have those colors and other palettes
and you know I would say and you like
those other palettes I would say
probably stick with those palettes and I
want to think about the dark magic one
it was hard to work with just as I was
kind of experiencing in my first
impression video but to do a couple
swatches so I want to compare it first
to the original Jaclyn hill palette
because I know that's been the most
questioned is is it super similar to the
original palette so I have not been
looking at myself in the viewfinder at
all so I have no idea like I'm looking
crazy look out girl look out sometimes
okay so I'm going to first swatch
power-cut and then there was two shades
in the original palette that I want to
swatch it to and that was obsessed over
here and then also hustle which is this
one right here and I really didn't find
a dupe for it and of course wanted to
swatch some of these greens as well so I
- watch this one here is trickery and I
wanted to swatch that one against Deva
from the original palette looking at
them in the pants I was like that
probably won't be too similar but again
I just want it to be able to show you
guys so you have an idea and then next
up I want it to swatch inside job from
the new palette which is the matte green
wanted to swatch that against enchant it
which is also the dark green from the
original palette so these two swatches
down here so we have the new one here
and then the original palette so again
they're not exact dupes to one another
but they are fairly similar but I think
the green and the original palette is
actually better but even on the eyes
because I have played what the green and
this palette as well it's not my most
used shade out of this palette but I
have played with it and I felt like I
wasn't getting the amount of patchiness
that I was getting when I was playing
with the dark magic palette so not
complete dupes but they are very similar
to one another and I think once you
start to blend them out they would be
very similar to one another but I think
the one and the original palette is
better and because I was talking about
at the dream street palette I thought I
would show you a couple of swatches here
so I wanted to swatch the Blues in the
palette so busted is the matte blue in
there and I wanted to swatch that
against this second blue right here
which i think is called water-bearer
from the dream street palette so on top
way up the Jaclyn hill and on bottom we
have the color pop so I feel like you
can just tell from the swatch right away
I'm just like what I was saying I think
that this one is better in the dream
Street palette so that's like the color
that you're really eyeing out of the
Jaclyn hill palette you really really
really want that blue and you have the
dream Street I don't think that you need
dark magic because again even swatch it
against each other I think that you can
tell that it is better in the color pop
and then there's again there's really
not a lot of other similarities between
those two palettes but just to show you
the shimmers so I am going to go ahead
and swatch power-cut I'm gonna swatch
that against what looks like the silver
in the palette there which I believe is
called kaleidoscope so these are not
super similar either they look
or similar on camera I feel like it's
coming across but the power cut is more
of like silver and almost like a hint of
purple in it and then kaleidoscope
actually has like a green shift into it
so if you can tell the difference
between those and I think that's kind of
where the similarities end with the
palette so I just wanted to show you
that because I did make reference to it
in my first impression video so next up
we have I think it's a reason why I'm in
such like a bad mood right now
does this one really bummed me out so
next up we have the yellow palette which
is called armed and gorgeous so inside
you have all these beautiful yellows in
here and oranges and golds and I was
very excited when I talked about this in
my will I buy a video I said this was
the second palette that I was most
excited for and that I was planning it
to pick up for myself
now when I did my first impressions
video I tried to do a different look for
each of the four looks so I had a halo
eye a smokey eye you know the mermaid
eye with the winged with the shadows and
then when I went into the yellow palette
I did something super super simple
so in that first impression this video I
put a little bit of agent into my crease
I put access all over the lid and I put
a little bit of coin on onto my lid as
well over the yellow and I loved I love
that love that look I thought it was
great I'm so into yellow looks right now
I keep doing them I think there are so
much fun I thought it was perfect for
summer I was like yes so I was like I
love this palette I know I can feel it
and I have had horrible luck with those
palette cuts horrible luck with this
palette actually the other day I was
filming for Friday's video which was a
flashback favorites video where I
actually talked about this video art
this palette and falling in love with it
last year and I said but stay tuned
because you know might be like singing a
different tune in Sunday's video where
I'm reviewing the new palettes and I
said let me just say that this isn't the
first makeup look that I've tried to do
today and when I was filming for that
video I first started I was you know
gonna use this palette again to make
sure that I was trying all the shades
out and I actually had to go and remove
my makeup because it was going so wrong
and I
very rarely have to do that like yeah
yes my makeup skills aren't up there and
I never have worked as a makeup artist
but I typically can make things work and
it was just going wrong and then it went
worse and then it was we took another
wrong turn and I was like hmm why is
this happening it had gone so wrong and
it looked so bad that I knew that I
could not film a video with that I look
and I am so sad about that end up doing
another look for that flashback video
and I liked it but it was still a
struggle to get there I'm so shocked I'm
so shocked that this Network out for me
I still am and I mean I know I only use
like three shades and my first
impression so of course you can't really
go off of much with the first impression
but I'm so surprised access I still
think is a beautiful color I love that
as a yellow color even coin and also
guilt trip I really like those shades
also I think those are really nice I
used classified all over my lid for
Friday's video and I had a pretty tough
time with this one even when I was using
a damp brush I was having a really tough
time building that up and it took me a
while there was followed on my face and
I was just like what in the heck is
going on here this green and top-secret
I can't use it I can't use it I can't
figure out what to do with it because
every single time that I've tried to
blend it onto my lid it's really really
bad it's really bad it's really patchy I
tried to pack it over all over my lid
once as just like I wasn't doing a load
but as almost kind of like didn't like a
live swatch on my eyes but just with me
and even still it just doesn't look good
just packing it onto the lid and I'm
like what no how is this happening
smooth criminal' is also incredibly hard
to use really hard to blend and really
patchy these were colors that I have on
my eyes originally even secure is is
tough to work with as well agent isn't
terrible but it's a very like strange
color it's a very like weak orange Brown
VIP is a really nice like stark white
shade
but overall I really think like these
three are the best in the palette and
and the other shades just are not really
working I'm so surprised so surprised
and I'm so bummed if you saw my first
impression if you saw my will I buy it
like you know how excited I was for this
collection palette especially I really
wouldn't be able to recommend because
I'm sure you have a yellow and I'm sure
you have some gold shimmers man I feel
like a Negative Nancy in this video and
I don't like it I don't I'm not a
negative person I like to find
positivity and anything that's on
YouTube and that's in real life like I
love rainbows and s'mores and s'more
sounds good right now I also want to be
honest and I think that this one was the
one that I had such a different reaction
to from my first impression that I just
really wanted to be able to come on and
say like hey this is like a total 180
from my first impression but you know
obviously I only used a handful of
shades in that one so after I tried
everything on my eyes this one is really
really difficult for me to recommend the
mats are so hard to work with in this
palette another thing that I just find
interesting about this collection is I
feel like it's very I feel like the
palettes are different from one another
ring the alarm I had very little
problems with armed and gorgeous I can't
freaking use like I know I'm not the
best but they don't my oh I guess this
just may go it's not that big of a deal
but look let's just go let's just go
into some comparison it so watches let
me get my list out which one are we
doing armed and gorgeous okay so to show
some comparison swatches it to the
Justin Hill palette I wanted to swatch
VIP which is this white shimmer and I
thought I would swatch it against beam
again these two I didn't think would be
very similar it's the second one here I
truly didn't think that they would be
similar but you know for comparison
sakes let's do it
so VIP is on top again that's a really
nice shade it's not something that I'm
going to use the ton but it's a nice
shade beam is on the bottom so
definitely when I saw these shade access
in here the second one I immediately
thought of creamsicle from the original
palette so I definitely
to swatch those against each other so we
have the new palette on top if you can
see that okay and then we have a
creamsicle here on the bottom these
swatch pretty similar to one another
I'll say that creamsicle fascicle has
more orange in it where the one from the
new palette is more yellow but honestly
I think that it looks way more of like a
true yellow on the eyes and you could
see that when I did the first impression
where I think that the one from the
original palette still pulls more orange
even on the eyes so next up I have
smooth criminal' from the new palette
which is a brown and i swatched that
against mocha from the original palette
and also a Central Park from the
original palette because they both look
to be kind of a deeper Brown but
actually the two from the original pilot
look a more similar than smooth
criminal' from the new palette the souls
day for this palette even the shimmers
nothing really screamed that we would
have exact exact dupes from the Jaclyn
hill palette but I did go ahead and
swatch classified from the new palette I
did swatch that against two different
shimmers so I did against Meeks which is
right here and then also Queen because
it looked like Queen was kind of more of
like that deeper color but again nothing
too similar to each other so we have the
new palette on top and then we have
Meeks and Queen from the original
palette people mentioned to me when they
thought armed and gorgeous they thought
the color pop yes please palette so I'm
going to go ahead and swatch again
access which is the yellow I'm going to
swatch it against the yellow in the
color pop palette I mean I feel like you
can kind of tell right off the way right
off the bat how they swatch that they
look really different they actually look
more similar on the ice to one another I
will say it also wanted to swatch
guilt-trip which is the shimmer right
here I wanted to swatch that against
this gold right here now these to me are
almost an exact dupe to one another so
we have the new duck lintel on top and
then they color pop on bottom two more
quick comparisons so I thought I would
swatch Brown and the new palette against
this kind of darker shade down here and
these two are not just super similar to
me so we have the new Ducklin hill on
top and the color pop on
bottom so you can see that they are not
not really dupes to one another and then
I also wanted to swatch a secured from
the Jaclyn hill palette and swatch that
against this top orange shade from the
color pop yes please
and again these are not super similar to
one another as well so those are just
some swatches comparing it to the yes
please palette so it's it's interesting
because there are some similarities
across these palettes honestly the the
yes please pellet is not my favorite
favorite palette from colour-pop but I
still would recommend it over this one
and unfortunately armed and gorgeous
just happened to be a huge miss for me
which I'm I'm quite bummed about because
that was one that I was um one of the
ones that I was most excited for so
unfortunately I really would not be able
to recommend this palette but next up I
want to talk about the a fourth and
final palette this one is bling boss
this is the purple palette this one was
the one that I said I was most excited
for when I filmed my will i buy it video
I am so into purples right now and when
I was seeing this and I was seeing the
swatches I was like oh my gosh
yes I loved the halo ID that I did in
that video and I think that was the most
because I you know I said what is your
favorite look and I think it was the
purple halo i hands-down I filmed
another video after filming the morphe
video I filmed my Beauty empties and I
wore that same look and I got so many
compliments once again is what I have on
my eyes today as well I'll see I really
this was the one that I used my first
impression I really didn't have any
issues with that one I did spring my
brush and I you know I had a fine time
using it I will say glitz and glam you
just have to build up quite a bit and
then I used bling bling today on my eyes
and so it's in the the inner part of my
eyes and once again I just have to build
it up so the shimmers across the board
don't have as much powell pizzazz as
maybe as i thought that they were going
to I really like that we have hush hush
in there Rockstar is what I do have on
the outer my outer lids as well today
gem I think is really beautiful I love
gem so much I think that's a really nice
color and actually spark a spark is one
where I didn't use it well I have on my
lower lashline today but I also just
kind of did that like a live swatch
thing when I was just wanting to make
sure I had all the
shades on my eyes I actually really like
that one I thought I was gonna have a
lot of difficulty with it and I really
didn't so thankfully that one put me in
a better mood I will say though that
mystic was harder to blend for me and
that one was a little bit more on the
patchy air side but out of the entire
palette I think that was the one that I
liked had the most amount of trouble
with I still I still feel like I would
suggest ring the alarm first and then
bling boss and then actually dark magic
and armed and gorgeous though it would
kind of be the way that I would go I
don't think it's like a absolute
must-have pellet and I did want to
compare it to this hood of beauty
palette the marvelous are the mob
obsessions marvelous mops they mop up
sessions palettes I'll do some swatches
against this one as well and do some
comparisons to the Jaclyn hill palette
so first I wanted to swatch bling bling
which is the first shade here and I
wanted to swatch that one against faint
which is this third shimmer in the top
row on the original palette so those are
the first two swatches I feel like again
on camera they're gonna come across
pretty pretty similar and they're I mean
they're definitely similar but they're
not exact dupes I also of course wanted
to swatch Jem because when I saw Jem and
when the original palette picture came
out that shades already in the original
palette because I was thinking that it
would be really similar to royalty here
in the original palette but these are
definitely very very different shades so
we have new palette on top here and the
original palette on the bottom so you
can see that the original one and
royalty is just more of a deeper red but
they even feel different one another gem
from the new palette is more like a
smooth metallic where the one from the
original palette is it's not chunky but
it's they're different I'm also gonna
swatch mystic from the new palette and I
wanted to swatch that against soda pop
the second one from the original palette
so those are the top two so we have the
new palette on top and the original on
bottom or at the bottom swatches I
wanted to swatch sparks right here and i
swatched that against Jax and the
original palette which is yes which is
this
third one right here and once again I
didn't find these to be just too similar
to one another but I actually want to
also swatch hunts against those ones as
well just to see okay so we have the new
palette here and then we have Jack's
from the original and also hunts from
the original as well okay and then the
last swatch against the two so I'm going
to swatch glitz and glam from the new
palette and then I also swatch it with
two colors here so I did SBN from the
original and also obsessed from the
original and these as well are not very
similar so we'll also do some swatches
with this one against the one from hood
beauty okay so first up i swatched
bling-bling from the Jaclyn hill palette
and I did this elastomer on the top row
against the hood of beauty these are
almost identical shades so if you can
see there in camera and in person they
are nearly identical Jaclyn has maybe
just a little bit more pink to it but
they are very very similar swatches some
mats i swatched hush-hush
which is the second one in the Jaclyn
palette and i swatched it to the middle
mat from the hood of beauty so these are
fairly similar to one another there is a
slight difference between the two I
would say Jacqueline's has more of like
a purple lilac undertone where who does
is more of like a red purple they are
pretty similar to one another but they
are not exact so I wanted to swatch
mystic from the Jaclyn hill palette and
then I was going to swatch that against
the first shade here in the hood of
Beauty again these two are almost an
exact dupe for one another those are the
shades that I thought would be closest
to one another from this palette so you
can see there are a couple dupes in
there so this one definitely I feel like
is really similar to this one if I had
to recommend one over the other I mean
they are not the exact same palettes but
I love these hooded Beauty I shadow
palettes these are $27 so they're more
expensive than the $15 but I enjoyed
these across the board I think they are
so well done I have four of them now and
I've bought them all myself and I'm very
impressed with them so I would highly
recommend these are guys so
those are my thoughts on each of the
four individual pallets how they've been
working for me now that I've been
playing with them for a full week
swatches against the original palette
and some other palettes my collection
and what I think against the two so to
wrap it up and to give my final thoughts
on the full collection I truly don't
think that I would be able to recommend
getting all four pallets I think that
there's a lot of inconsistencies between
the four which is just super surprising
to me it were to be comparing it to the
original Jaclyn hill palette if you're
saying hey I don't have either which one
should I get I'm gonna say the original
Jaclyn hill palette this palette I think
is fantastic
it's $38 for 35 different shadows you
can get it available at Alta now but the
quality in this palette I think is so so
good the impression that we were going
to get a big palette such as the Jaclyn
hill palette and just have it kind of
like chopped up into four little
palettes but it would be the same
quality across all four and I just don't
feel like I'm getting that some of the
math are different some of the shimmers
are different I think as I started
playing with the more throughout the
week I was just getting caught off guard
of how different I thought each of the
pallets were that's why I can't
wholeheartedly recommend the collection
I was just kind of kind of in a sour
mood the whole time because I was really
really really really excited for this
collection I think you could see that in
my past videos but it doesn't matter how
excited I am for something I still have
to be able to come on and try to do my
best review and give you guys my best
thoughts so I really hope that you found
this video helpful I hope that you found
the swatches and the comparisons helpful
is gonna do it for today's video guys
thanks for hanging in with me I know
this one was a long one but I wanted to
get all my thoughts out there if you
guys didn't enjoy this video or you
found it helpful I hope that you'll give
this one a thumbs up I hoped I should
