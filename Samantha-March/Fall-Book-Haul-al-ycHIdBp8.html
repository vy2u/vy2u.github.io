I'm going to doing a new book haul for
you so I have just a handful of new
books all are going to be ebooks that I
have received recently so if you would
like to see the new books that I have
added to my reading list for the fall
please keep watching have is collision
and this is by PJ buyer and I got this
with CLP blog tours and it says angry
and defiant Stella runs away from home
in lands in a small seaside village it
is overlooked by the forbidding ruins of
trial Bay gay out Stella hides out in
the town and is disturbed by her growing
confusion about her identity her
mysterious flashbacks to the gal 100
years before even more frightening what
is reality what is fantasy and is the
guy next door the one to help her solve
the mystery or will a stranger unlike
the key to her past so that sounds like
a lot is going on in that book so that
is a collision by pj buyer the next one
i have is extreme measures and this is
by Mickie Jay corrigan and I have also
read red hot blues from Mickey and it
was a novella and I really liked it I
don't think this one is a novella know
it says was 238 pages and it's 499 on
Amazon so this one looks like it is
going to be a full-length novel all the
books that I mentioned here I will leave
their amazon links below and then like
for mickey's since i have read from her
I can leave my review for red hat blues
below as well this says we follow Vania
who runs a domestic investigations
agency in downscale deep port beach
florida she spies on cheating spouses
while struggling to recover from her own
employed marriage says it's her unique p
I firm also offers extreme measures
special services designed to get rid of
the marital problem forever so we also
get involved with Ringo vanna's trusted
assistant a hunky ex-cop who is worried
they have clients line to them the
competition is moving in and everyone in
South Florida is either crazy or
untrustworthy or both it says that this
combines humor action and evolutionary
biology to investigate some of our
culture's most pressing mr.
ways including why men act like men and
why the hell women put up with it so
that is extreme measures by Mickie Jay
Corrigan that I received is death before
decaf and this is by Carolyn ferdig far
dig good I always say that wrong I've
mentioned so many videos it's Carolyn
farted big yes a vast one I have
mentioned Carolyn several times because
of her Lizzie heart mystery series that
I have said I have loved so much and it
looks like we are getting a new mystery
series from her it says death before
decaf is a java jive mystery so I don't
know for sure if it's a series um not
for sure if this one is a series but I
don't care because I love mysteries I
love this cover I love the title it just
looks great it says it's perfect for
fans of janet Evan itch and Diane Mont
Davidson Carolyn fard eggs come
captivating new mystery novel takes
readers behind the counter of a
seemingly run-of-the-mill coffee house
where murder is brewing so I'm so
excited to read this one I couldn't wait
when Caroline asked me to review it I
was like mmm yes but I received is
investigating the heart and this is by
Heidi Renee Mason and I actually just
finished reading this one I'm recording
this haul video a little bit later than
I intended on because I had family in
town for the weekend so I drove four
hours out of town to see my family we
are military family and they were
visiting Iowa from Alabama so me and my
dog just the two of us we had a girls
trip up to Dubuque Iowa and then back to
Des Moines friday and then we came back
saturday so I'm a little bit behind on
getting the videos recorded and out for
you so i actually have already read this
one so it will be coming up in a
neighbor view video hello I'm on McCoy
she's a single mom of three girls after
her husband is involved in a plane crash
and passes away and during that time she
finds out that he was actually involved
with their next-door neighbor Veronica
so that kind is what sets off the book
then she meets a man and falls for him
but finds out that he has not been
truthful to her who exactly
he is and his connection that he has
with her deceased husband and kind of a
mystery that he was involved in so my
review will be coming soon to tickle
applause and also you to the next one
that i have is pieces of it all and this
is by tracy krimmer and i also mentioned
tracy in a lot of my videos including
favorites videos because i've read
jaywalking and cashing in from her and i
gave both of them five stars I've been
really enjoying her books so she asked
if I would want to read pieces of it all
and I said yes as an alcoholic a scarred
man a thief Harvey as a 22 year old high
school dropout who arrives home after
Bray stint in rehab and he's ready to
start his life again he meets Beth and
her innocence and her desire to have it
all captures him completely a girl on
the cusp of womanhood determined a
bright future Beth as a recent high
school graduate among the top of her
class she can't wait to get to college
and fulfill her dreams and then she
meets Harvey with his mysterious past
and he stirs feelings in her she can't
ignore and it looks like it's going to
be about the chemistry between them but
obviously we have two very different
people going on the pieces of their
lives well I've broken all around them
 Harvey put his life back
together and win over Beth and confess
find the strength to become the woman
she wants without sacrificing her
integrity so I'm really excited to read
this one it sounds a lot different than
cashing in and jaywalking but i really
love Tracy's work so I'm excited to give
this one a read the next one that I have
is the view from Prince Street and this
is by Mary Ellen Taylor this one is
available for pre-order it actually
doesn't come out until January it
releases January fist so I got like an
advance advance review copy I dunno the
one from Carolyn fair deck that I
mentioned as well is also on pre-order I
can list the release date in the
description box below along with those
things but I think those were my only
two books that i have that are not yet
for sale i believe view from prince
street is an alexandra novel from the
alexandria series by mary ellen taylor i
have read mariela taylor and i really
enjoy her books I know some other
reviewers for chocolate pluses abroad
from her as well and we all seem to
really enjoy them when I saw that it was
in the alexandria serious i really
wanted to read it because i've read the
union street bakery by i'm mary ellen
taylor as well and i really enjoyed it
and i believe that was a part of the
alexandria series so when i saw this one
i decided that i wanted to give it a
read for myself so I'm looking forward
to reading the view of that is all of
the books that I have received in my
