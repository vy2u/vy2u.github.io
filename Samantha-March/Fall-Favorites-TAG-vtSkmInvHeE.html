today's video I'm finally going to be
doing the fall favorites tag and this is
the tag that youtuber jaclyn hill
created a few weeks ago she tagged all
of her subscribers i subscribed to her
so i'd like to think that she tagged me
personally that's what i'm going to say
i also watched kathleenlights fail fall
favorites tag just this morning and she
also tied to anyone who was watching it
so again I would like to think that
Kathleen tagged me personally yeah super
excited to do this I've been watching so
many people filming this tag it like
really lit up the YouTube world and it's
just been a lot of fun to watch what
everyone's favorites are especially
people like all around the country
because it was just kind of interesting
to watch kathleenlights as this morning
because she's from Miami just like it
doesn't get cold here it was just
interesting to see what everyone's that
favorites are so that is what i'll be
doing today there's just a few questions
to go over share our favorite things and
yes I think that's all I'm kind of
nervous because I'm wearing this like
super dark lipstick and it kept getting
all over my teeth like after I applied
it I'd look in the mirror and there'd be
more on my teeth so if you see me like a
lot it's because I don't have a
viewfinder so I can't see myself so I'm
like oh that's just image on the radar
so question is favorite fall candle now
I'm going to be really honest when I say
I am NOT a huge candle person and it's
just been very recently that I've
started getting into candles and both me
and my husband like at night we're like
oh yeah we should light a candle cuz we
would have a candle and it would be
sitting on our stove and like a month's
would pass and it would be like oh yeah
we should probably like that candle some
time we've just never been big candle
people but it seems like more and more
we're starting to get into it last
winter we definitely like it just kind
of feels cozy when you have your candle
being lit so we're slowly getting into
IV at our last target trip we just
bought this fall wreath candle and it's
from yankee candle so we just got it at
target it was kind of expensive I'm like
maybe that's why I don't buy candles it
was like 15 or 17 dollars smiles like
okay
but I've been watching everyone's
favorite videos and a lot of Bath and
Body candles are mentioned I don't
remember the last time I've been to
about the body probably because they are
all in our mouths and I try to avoid
them all as much as i can because our
models are just crazy no matter when we
go it's hard to find a parking spot I
don't like all the people it stresses me
out just can't do it but I'm like I've
made a commitment to myself that the
next time we go to the mall I'm going to
go into bath and body works and pick up
a candle I've been seeing sweater
weather I think it's called mentioned a
lot and then also a marshmallow candle
that I'm like yes I need a marshmallow
candle in and around my life like I
didn't even know they made candles with
all these great sense because I just
don't buy candles the next one was a
favorite lipstick and I was like well
Jacqueline that's rude because can we
only pick one I don't know how to pick
one I am like obsessed with lipsticks I
love them i only have like this teeny
tiny collection it slowly like it's
starting to get a little bit bigger and
i do need to buy another one of the
containers to put them in but i just
love lipsticks i love having a variety
of them love it so i picked for i
narrowed it down to four and two are
from colour-pop the one I'm wearing on
my lips right now is limbo and it is
just a brown it's like a chocolate
chocolate brown so I'll swatch it for
you on my hand both of these that I'm
going to mention from colour-pop all
there are the ultra matte liquid
lipsticks so that is limbo am I saying
that right yeah limbo so it's a liquid
lipstick I dries matte it stays on all
day the only thing that I don't like
about the dark liquid lipsticks is this
like that's not cute that's not cute at
all Jacqueline calls them butthole lips
and that's exactly what they look like
it's pretty disturbing um oh good the
UPS man just pull up and is looking at
me like what is this girl doing but the
next one from colour-pop is bumble and I
wore this in my jack
Collins video that I just posted the
other day which thank you for all the
nice comments on that video that really
meant a lot to me weirdest thing just
happened so the UPS truck pulled up and
he comes out and he gives me the box and
I look at the return and I know who was
from I know what it is and I take it
close the door turn around and the
doorbell rings again and I'm like okay
and I opened it and he goes um
apparently I can't deliver that package
and I'm like what like it says my name
on it it's addressed to me my address I
know who it's from it's something it's a
package like I'm expecting and I was
like ok he's like I just typed it in my
thing and it said do not deliver I'm
like okay so it's from it out there so
I'm just gonna email her and be like um
you might want to look into that cuz it
was a pretty heavy box I don't know that
was just the weirdest thing ever you
just like took it away from me and I was
like okay huh anyways let's jump egg
into the video so the next one that I
was going to talk about is bumble this
is it right here like I said I wore it
in the Jackie Collins video like i was
saying thank you to everyone who was on
comments and I've gotten a lot of emails
from you guys as well I hope that video
so thank you so much I'm really glad
that you enjoyed the video it was hard
to make but it was something I wanted to
make so thank you but yes this was the
lip color that I was wearing in it it
looks like rather in the bottle I think
but it actually dries to like a
beautiful like kind of a deep pink and I
don't know I like a deep pink red I just
thought it was so pretty and I've been
wearing it a lot I really love these
ultra matte lipsticks from colour-pop
and I have like five more in my virtual
card online right now can't wait to
place another order the next one that I
have is from Gerard cosmetics which come
in these little like gold bullet looking
things I'm so sad my dog chewed it like
right after I got it and I was so bummed
out but the color is 1995 and I have
done a whole video on droid cosmetics
and all of the lipsticks and lip glosses
that I own for them and did swatches and
I will put it in like the card up here
but that is 90
95 and it's just supposed to be kind of
like a 90s grunge lipstick color so I
don't know it's it's really hard to
describe because it's like kind of like
a reddish brown but it's so beautiful
for fall I absolutely love to wear it i
get so many compliments whenever i do
where I last one is from l'oreal it's
just a simple red and it's from like
their l'oreal comes out with certain
collections i know they have a nude and
now they have a red and each one is like
create it by a celebrity so it's named
after them so this one is Blake after
Blake Lively who happens to be one of my
favorite actresses I just love her but
it's just a really beautiful like true
red and has just I would say just like a
smidge of a pink undertone boom for the
most part like if you were just looking
for a red classic lip then I really
recommend Blake from l'oreal and this is
drugstore of course so it is affordable
the dryer cosmetics one I think it's
like nineteen dollars for their
lipsticks but they do run like sales and
have discount codes quite a bit so you
can get them a little bit cheaper and
then the colour-pop lippie is the ultra
mass I believe are six dollars which
hello this question is a favorite drink
so I'm going to be honest with you guys
again I'm not a big coffee drinker like
I've been watching everyone's videos a
lot of people are mentioning coffee a
lot of people are mentioning starbucks
and that little thing called a pumpkin
spice latte I don't like Starbucks I
really can never find anything at
starbucks that I want I don't even like
their basic hot chocolate but my thing
is I don't like coffee I don't like the
taste of coffee I really don't like the
smell of coffee I've tried giving things
from starbucks like the white mocha
lattes and things like that still tastes
like coffee to me the only coffee drink
that I truly enjoy is actually just from
a gas station that we have here in the
area it's called come and go there
around the Midwest so if anyone's heard
of come and go let me know or if you
don't like Starbucks give this video a
thumbs up and let me know because
sometimes when i say i don't like
starbucks i feel like girls look at me
like I just I just don't like it I don't
know get
french vanilla charger at come and go
and to me it has no coffee taste at all
um it tastes I guess what it's supposed
to be is like a french vanilla
cappuccino type of thing but very
uncaught has an extra shot of caffeine
in it which is where the charger comes
from to me I mean I call it coffee I
think it is coffee the company that
makes it is called Java Ridge if you
guys really want to know that but that's
basically what I drink at home during
the winter when it starts to get colder
I always have just like regular Swiss
mill hot chocolate like I buy them by
the box and then I just stop it with
marshmallows like I have to have
probably like 25 marshmallows like the
little ones in my hot chocolate or I
just can't drink it so love me some
marshmallows which is why I want a
marshmallow candles so bad I love
marshmallows I did want to try like the
starbucks came out with like that graham
cracker lot a bronze like oh he's like a
graham cracker and has marshmallow and
I'm like I should try it but I really
just don't want to spend like whatever
how much money it is on an overpriced
Starbucks drink and then take wondering
can be like because that's happened to
me way too much next one is favorite
blush and this is also going to be from
colour-pop I did a whole video on color
pop I'll leave it in the card below I
was blown away by all of the products
they got from totally loving them but
the blush i got is quarters and it is
just so perfect for fall I think it
looks like and their products like the
consistency everyone I mean if you've
watched a new sort of color pop video
like you will know that people are like
it almost feels what it feels like a
moose it just I don't know it's so
bizarre like I literally feel like I
could touch their products all day long
but that is what it looks like it's
really more they describe it as a dusty
coral which to me doesn't seem like fall
but when I put it on I'm not wearing it
today of course because that would just
make too much sense but when I put it on
it's just a beautiful kind of like
reddish orange coral color and I just
think it's
beautiful i've been wearing it so much
and I just think it's perfect for fall
so that is quarters by color pop this
one is favorite fall clothing so I'm in
Iowa I'm in the Midwest it gets cold
here in the fall am i too like staples
for fall are a leather jacket in Talbots
so these are the boots i have i don't
know if you can see them but they are
just simple brown boots I mean really
not much of a heel they have the zip on
the side these are from lauren conrad's
collection at kohls i got on the last
year and i'm so happy with them I
wearing with skinny jeans I wearing with
leggings I wear them all the time does
the leather jacket that I have and it is
from express you guys can see that i
like it because it's like a fitted
leather jacket so it's not really baggy
on me it's not small but i just love it
the leather jackets from express are a
little bit expensive but I've had this
jacket for probably two or three years I
mean it doesn't look like I have there's
the materials not being affected like it
just is really good quality and I think
this is again like such a staple piece
to have in your closet I wear it so much
in the fall it can dress up an outfit I
mean I get so many compliments on it so
yes love my leather jacket first one is
favorite movie and both Jacqueline said
this was her favorite movie and
kathleenlights and I think they both
were like everyone's gonna say this
because who doesn't love hocus pocus who
does not love hocus pocus that movie
it's just so funny we had a girls night
last year around this time it was like
eight or nine of us girls I want a
friend moved like out of town so it was
like a 45 minute drive to get to her
house so we just all decided to go there
have dinner I'll spend the night so no
one would have to do that drive home we
played the move or we played the game I
was it called like dream phone does
anyone remember dream phone where you
actually like how to phone and you would
dial it and oh my gosh it just yes we
played that and then at the end of the
night we watched hocus pocus and then we
clueless afterwards but hocus pocus is
just so awesome and sarah jessica
parker's character in there just cracks
me up and when i watch the movie now
because I probably watch it you know at
least three times during this season
when it's on TV or when I'm with friends
we have to watch it but it's so funny to
think watching that as a kid and not
quite understanding it and watching it
now and realizing she's just a whore I'm
like oh who knew not me it just cracks
me up and I was watching Jacqueline's
snap the other day and one of her
subscribers enter a coffee mug and said
um oh look another glorious morning
makes me sick another teeth and the nut
oh my gosh yes to all of it my son is a
favorite TV show okay you guys again I
don't watch TV I just don't watch it I
don't I don't have time for it i feel
like if i had a TV in my office I would
probably watch TV a lot but I'm always
in my office and I don't want to walk
out into the living room to watch TV I'd
rather be in here and be working so i
don't really watch shows like at one
point I was trying to record show so I
could watch him when I was just like
chilling at home but that doesn't really
work out for me maybe in the winter I'll
start watching again when we don't go as
many places but I'm a big sports girl I
do watch games fall to me is football I
love watching the packers I'm a big Cubs
fan as well and usually Cubs does not
equal fall baseball but this year it is
and I'm so excited I'm filming this
before the wild card game and oh my
fingers are crossed that is going to be
crazy when they play the Pirates in the
wild-card game I'm sure going to be
cheering them on so hard because it was
would be amazing if they could move on
my son is a favorite Thanksgiving food
my husband makes the best i think it's
just called cheesy potatoes that can't
be right is that right now like I feel
like I don't know what it's called but I
don't know he makes them and it's so
good but I think it's just like some
sort of potato like a hash brown in
there and then I don't know there's like
sour cream and there's cheese and he
like
sprinkles Ritz crackers on top I don't
know is it is that cheesy potatoes
that's what I think it is I don't know
I've never helped him make him but he
makes those and I just think they are so
good I look forward to them whenever I
see that someone has them out of
Thanksgiving meal are really any meal in
general I'm like yes I even make my
husband just make them randomly from
time to time I'm like how about we make
that dish because it's good last year we
did not travel from Thanksgiving because
he had to work the friday afterwards and
I think I worked too so we just stayed
home and had like a little dinner just
the two of us and he made those and i
swear i was eating nothing but those for
like two days straight and it was
awesome and I didn't feel bad about it
very last question is a favorite
Halloween costume like favorite costume
that I've worn and last year me and my
girlfriend's dressed up as minions I
think there was like three four five six
of us maybe six of us I dressed up as
minions and it was such an easy costume
I mean we just went out and bought
yellow shirts we wore jean shorts we
borrowed suspenders from someone's
grandfather and then we made like we
took like canning lids and put him on a
string and tried to run our head as our
glasses and that was it it was so cheap
it was so easy and it was so fun because
it was a bunch of us so I had a blast as
that one this year I'm really excited
we're doing another girlfriend sing
again and I'm really excited to share
with you guys what we are how to put
pictures in here yet I don't think I can
do that yet but I thought maybe I would
share like a throwback Thursday of some
of my favorite Halloween costumes on
Instagram so if you go to march books
beauty on instagram i will share a few
pictures on there but another one that i
loved like i said i'm a Big Green Bay
Fan the year that Green Bay won the
Super Bowl I went that Halloween as clay
matthews trophy wife because I love Clay
Matthews and I am it was such another
like super simple easy and cheap costume
I already owned his jersey obviously so
I wore his jersey and like black shorts
and heels but then I had I carried
around a trophy from my
days and it was before I was engaged or
married and I had just put on like a big
like fake diamond ring boom click
Matthews dropping wife it was awesome it
was great I loved it another one I
dressed up a Cinderella one year and I
really enjoyed that but it was adult
like it was adult Cinderella it was Matt
what a child would wear but those are
probably some of my phone or costumes
that I wore so again I'll try to find
pictures of each one and kind of like
collage room together and post them on
Instagram if you want to a check those
out okay so that is it for the fall
favorites tech I hope you enjoyed
watching this I hope you've been
watching the other videos because like I
said they've just been so much fun to
see everybody's different answers it's
been a blast to watch all of them I mean
thank you to Jacqueline and Kathleen for
tagging me I really appreciate that it
will be tagging a few of you below so
check the description box because I'll
have a few people tagged to do this
video it's kind of hard I'm really sorry
if I tag you and you've already done the
video but like the video keeps popping
up so fast and I'm almost kind of
worried like I'm going to tag someone
get the video ready post it and then
they're gonna pose it like the same day
but like I already did it I'm sorry
taking a few people below in the box but
if you haven't done it yet i really
suggest you do it because i was kind of
fun that to think about kind of fun to
get into the fall spirit especially for
someone like me who I'm such a summer
girl and it's been really hard to
embrace fall especially because just
like that in Iowa it got cold I mean it
wasn't even like we didn't even
transition nicely like it just went from
I was tubing on the river to now I have
to wear boots in my leather jacket when
I go outside because it's so cold not
cool not cool to give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it subscribe
