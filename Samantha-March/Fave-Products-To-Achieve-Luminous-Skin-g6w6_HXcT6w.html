video is going to be on how I get
luminous looking skin so I live in Iowa
we are in like hardcore winter weather
right now it won't stop snowing the
temperatures struggle to get above zero
degrees like it is so cold and dry and
just my skin is totally suffering I
mentioned in a few videos about how I'm
always on the lookout for like new
products to help me achieve getting
luminous skin and I've had a few people
asked me to do a video on it and i also
like mentioned a few products either in
youtube or on instagram or in other
social media areas and people are asking
like did that really work that help and
so i thought i would share a video of
all of my favorite products that help me
achieve like luminous just healthy
looking skin not just like the dead dry
look because that's just like so not
cute so what I've done I have pulled a
few of my favorite products that I use
that when i'm feeling drier than normal
that I like to use these or even just
even if i'm not feeling dry even if i
just want like luminous looking skin
because i feel like it just looks better
you look healthier when you have a bit
of a glow going on so i pulled a few of
my favorite products these are not my
only products that i have bought for the
reason to get luminous skin but these
are my favorites and the other these are
the ones that i think actually works so
it's kind of like a mini favorites video
but it's all about unlike achieving
luminous skin and i don't know if you
guys want to play like a drinking game
for every time i say luminous or you
know maybe like something healthier like
you have to do a push-up every time i
say luminous because you're going to get
some sets in if you would like to see
some of my favorite products that help
me achieve luminous looking skin please
keep on learning that i do want to
mention before i get into the products
is that one of the most important ways
to have luminous skin but also just like
healthy skin is your skin care regimen
and I thought about bringing skincare
into this and talking about some old
like my favorite exfoliators and my
moisturizers but then I figured if I did
that like this video would be like 10
years on but I haven't done a skin care
video since like
last summer I think I did one right when
I was first getting on YouTube and I
talked about my skin care but I have had
a few more questions on skincare so if
you guys would want to see like an
updated skincare routine and the
products I use and kind of like the
routine that I go through please just
comment below and let me know and I will
be so happy to do that because i think i
have found like a really good routine
and a really good really good products
to use and that sort of thing but yeah
if you guys want to see that please do
comment below and let me know but that
definitely is a very important thing
that you're exfoliating your
moisturizing your cleansing like you're
keeping like you're doing your part to
help keep your skin healthy another
thing that i do want to mention is i
mean we just have such a dry skin right
now both me and my husband like i have
dry skin on my face my hands are dry our
scalps are dry and so we recently have
gone out and bought a humidifier for our
room to just kind of help get more
moisture into our bedroom when we sleep
at night we just turn it on and we let
our humidifier run we've only had it for
about two weeks right now but we're
really doing like everything we can to
try to not be the dry human beings that
we are right now that's another way I
hear that humidifiers can really help
people was like they're dry skins and
scallops and things like that but I can
of course give you an update and let you
guys know if I think it is working for
us and to get into the products the
first one I want to mention is from YSL
beauty and is there too she a clot
neutralizer no idea if I'm saying that
right once again and I'm seeing more
people are starting to talk about this
and I'm like watching the video so I'm
hearing how they say it everyone says it
differently so I'm like I don't feel
like any of us know how to say it so
maybe it's not a big deal that I don't
quite get it but basically I was sent
this in influencer I can leave my
unboxing video up here if you guys are
not familiar what's influenster it's a
great website that if you sign up and
take surveys and that sort of thing you
get sent products to review and it's not
only for beauty but I mean I know they
have like a whole men's section too they
have sports where they have home where
that pets I mean it doesn't it's not
just beauty and you don't have to be a
blogger or blogger but i will leave more
like that linkedin
monster below but basically I got sent
this neutralizer and I got sent the
violet shade these are brand new
products and they came out was three
different tones I got the violet one and
it is supposed to be to help brighten
skin and I was like that is what I need
right now like I need to be brighter
like that's just that's what I need in
my life right now and so I wasn't quite
sure what exactly I should do with it
when I first got it and I watched
someone else's video makeup by Ali and
she was putting it beneath her eyes and
I was like okay that's interesting like
I'm going to try that too so what I've
been doing with this is putting it on my
under eyes before I do anything this is
like my very first step I you know I
clean my skin I moisturize before I even
put primer on or any sort of concealer
anything like that this is what I go
with in first and I put it all under my
under eyes just like where I'd put my
concealer and then I put it anywhere
else on my skin that I feel like needs
to look a little brighter like sometimes
it's like down here in this area needs
to be a little brighter sometimes I have
like like kind of like dry patches itch
like on my forehead I'll put it there
sometimes around my nose anywhere that I
feel like I want to be brighter and then
I buff it in but not too much I don't
completely buff in the product
especially on my under eye I kind of
keep a little bit of that purple tinge
and then I will go ahead and put my
concealer on top of it and blend it all
together and it truly does work I was a
little leery about it when I first got
it and I was like I don't know this is
gonna work it kind of seems a little
weird to me and you know it's why I sell
so it's very expensive I'm like I don't
know it works and I'm so happy it does
and I'm so happy that this is like
literally when I'm doing my makeup first
thing that I use is this because I'm so
happy with it and because it works and
using it under the under eyes just makes
everything so much brighter and then
when you put your concealer on in your
setting powder oh like it just it works
so well so I've been super happy with
this one kind of how it works is that's
what it looks like in there and just has
like a little clicker pencil here and
the product comes out and you're just
social shoosh swipe it on and like I
said I don't Bluff it in completely all
the way I do
put my concealer on top of it and the
buff it all together and I feel like
that helps so that is the YSL
neutralizer in violet and then i also
have a few illuminating primers i have
to i have a couple illuminating primers
to talk about one is drugstore and one
is high-end i actually didn't plan it
that way it's just these happen to be my
two favorites but starting with the jerk
store one first this is the Maybelline
master buffet studio primer it is their
blur and illuminate primer it has like a
pink shading to it i bought this I mean
a while back and I can tell I'm I'm
getting down there I'm about out of it I
probably will repurchase this because I
really enjoyed it but when you squeeze
it out it is like a little pink like has
a pink tinge to it as well the actual
product does also see also has SPF 30 in
it well would you look at that but
basically this is a really good job at
doing exactly what it says it blurs and
so it blurs like imperfections blurs the
pores helps kind of fill everything in
and then illuminate it definitely gives
luminosity to the skin so I really enjoy
wearing this underneath a foundation
because it already helps bring some
luminous glow to my skin before I even
have to put foundation on its drugstore
it is affordable it's a little bit more
expensive on the Maybelline side because
for whatever reason they're like face
studio line seems to be a little bit
more expensive but it's still is
definitely cheaper than a higher-end
product one I have that is high-end is
one I believe I mentioned this in one of
my recent favorites videos but it is the
Beca backlight priming filter I never
know if I'm like saying backlight
priming filter and the right like order
never know but this is what it looks
like it comes in this beautiful like
frosted glass bottle and then when you
take the top off it is just a pump and I
usually do like two pumps in my hand and
this one I mean you can tell when you
put it on your hand that it's going to
make you luminous a beige color it's not
like the pink or the violet it's just
kind of like a beige color but has that
glow in it it smells good to me I don't
know if anyone else has this and you
think it smells good but for some reason
I really like the way it smells but this
is so pretty I feel like with this I
bought it not that long ago so I've only
had it in the winter months but I feel
like what this I could probably get away
with like where
this in the summer when I have like a
nice glow and I don't like to wear a lot
of foundation like I can just put this
on to kind of like smooth out my skin a
little bit but then give me a glow and
then I'm tan on top of it and life will
be really great I can't wait for summer
to get back here get back your summer
get back this is more expensive I'm not
sure exactly what a cost i think is like
in the upper 30s think now i can't
remember i can put in the description
box below but i got mine at sephora but
yes this is the Beca backlight primary
moving on to foundations I have two
foundations that I really like to use
when I'm going for luminous skin and
there are actually both drugstore so the
first one is the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
foundation so it just looks like this
this is what i use today so it's a
little bit on the dirty side of course
but it just has the pump like that my
shade is in w5 sand beige like I said it
is what I'm wearing today I do mix this
is kind of like a little bit light for
me so I have the l'oreal true match the
original one in the little glass bottle
and I have it in a really deep shade and
I just put a drop in with this to kind
of like match my skin a little bit so I
don't look like a pale vampire you know
what I mean oh yeah this is what I'm
wearing today this is like the first
like Leumi foundation that I ever bought
and i love it it really does just give
your skin a healthy glow to it but it's
nothing like super overpowering with
this one I can wear a luminous primer
like the Maybelline or the becca that i
mentioned with the other foundation i
talked about i will talk about I can't
use those but I can use it and still use
this and then I just look like extra
healthy and extra glowing people would
probably like ask me if I'm pregnant cuz
I'm glowing but I'm like no it's my
foundation in my primer you know the
other one is a new foundation to the
drugstore I did a first impression on it
and ended up in my favorites video I
absolutely love this stuff you guys it
is the L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion
so just like the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
but this is in there cushion form so I'm
really not surprised that I love it that
much because I truly do
loves the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
foundation so what the cushion came out
I was like probably going to love it and
I do my shade is in n 3.5 and I can link
my videos that I've done on this as well
but this is just what it looks like it
is a cushion soaked in foundation and it
comes with a nice mirror as well that
I'm trying not to blind you with but
this one I remember doing the first
impressions video and putting it on and
immediately being like holy crap this
makes me glow this makes my skin look so
healthy and I was so happy with it I am
like obsessed with that you guys I wear
it so much that I try to remind myself
like hey why don't you wear something
else today because the downside to this
foundation is that it's expensive it's
1699 which is crazy insane for a
drugstore foundation but it also only
comes with point 5 ounces so I'm like
don't use too much of it because you're
going to go through it really quick and
today I was going to use it today and I
had my Beauty Blender all ready to go
and I was like you something else you're
going to go through it and so I use the
little too much Louie true story I love
this one it definitely gives you a glow
to the point where like I said with the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi I can use a
primer lumen ating primer with that one
as well i don't think i can get away
with an illuminating primer what this
one I've tried it one time I used the
Maybelline primer and then this and it
just was like too much it goes a little
like you want to look healthy and you
want to look luminous and you want to
look glowing but not like too much like
girl are you just super oily like I
can't I can't tell what you did
especially because i love highlighter so
much and then what I just combined all
of it it was it was kind of a scary mess
so what I like to use but this one is
like a smoothing primer and I kind of
like smooth out my face that make up for
ever one is really good i just got a new
one from Tarte that i'm really enjoying
so that's what I will use for this one
but yeah if you want some luminous
healthy-looking skin this is it before i
get into highlighters i have one blush
that i want to talk about and i went
back and forth because i was like i
don't know if this makes sense like
primers foundations highlighters they
make sense and giving you like lunes
skin glowing looking skin too healthy
looking skin but like a blush does that
make sense and I'm like you know what
I'm going to because it's called Milani
Luminoso blush so what better way to get
luminous and why luminoso am i right so
this is what it looks like it is a
beautiful peach blush with sparkle to it
it is stunning i bought this because of
my subscribers everyone was saying that
you need to have this blush in your life
like when i asked for more drugstore
blush recommendations this is the one
that everyone said to get and I said I
would do it and the second I put it on I
was like girl you needed this in your
life three years ago what what were you
doing it's gorgeous it gives you a
beautiful glow to the cheeks it just
makes you look so healthy it's I mean I
can like load this stuff on and it never
looks too extreme like you know if you
love like Pinker Oh pink blush odd like
you're going to start looking like a
clown like I feel like I can put so much
of Luminoso on and it's just going to
make me look healthier and healthier and
go your and glowy or it's got a little
bit of sparkle to it but nothing like
that's going to make you look like
you're just a glittery mess like it
looks gorgeous my favorite way to wear
with luminoso is when I we're very
simple makeup and I just have like a
luminous foundation on I have very
simple as usually just like a wing and
some eyelashes nothing crazy with my
eyeshadows and then I just load up on
Milani Luminoso it's one of my favorite
looks I feel like it just makes my skin
it looks so healthy and I absolutely
love it if you need a good blush in your
life and the last items that I want to
mention our highlighters because
highlighters are a fantastic way to make
your skin more look more luminous
glowing and healthy and all that good
stuff that we were trying to achieve
from this video so I have four different
highlighters to talk about and I love
highlighters when the highlighting trend
came out I was like this is freaking
bomb because I just think it looks so
cool I have two that I want to mention
and they are actually I think I
mentioned these in a favorites video
once though but i actually prefer using
them together and it is the mary-lou
manizer from the bomb and it is what's
up from benefit
cosmetics the what's up came in like a
benefit box so it's like a mini version
of it the other one is is quite larger
the little wats up and it's actually a
cream highlighter so this is what the
little one looks like it's just a cream
I usually just use it with my finger and
I just it on and then I like to go in
what the mary-lou manizer and put it on
top of the cream highlighter and just
the two of these together I just think
ourselves stunning so this is what the
mary-lou manizer looks like it is a very
light pearlized frosty highlighter I
think it's gorgeous I mean I can wear
these separately but I just prefer to
wear them together because I think it's
beautiful when I talked about the simple
makeup I mentioned my foundation and my
my winged liner my lashes in my blush
but these two are the highlighter
combination that I'm using I've been
asked to do my basic makeup foundation
because I like talk about it so much and
I wear it so often and I do have that on
my schedule to film for you guys so you
will see everything that i just
mentioned you'll see like how i make it
into my makeup look that is coming very
soon but definitely two great
highlighters but together they're like
they're like yes and the next to that i
have to talk about are also from becca
cosmetics and clearly a big fan of becca
cosmetics that i really am I really
enjoy their line Becca just came out
with a new foundation and now I can't
think of what it's called but it's
basically like an illuminating
foundation to and I'm like got my eyes
on it i just got a sample of it in the
mail so i'm going to sample it out and
see if I like it but I'm pretty excited
for it but I have champagne pop and then
I have opal now opal came this is like
their little sample size because it came
as like free gift with purchase I think
because I bought champagne pop and the
illuminating primer at the same time I
think that's what I did so I got a free
sample of becca opal I actually don't
want to open this for you because it's
broken its broken it's very sad it's
very broken but you know i just opened
it carefully like over my sink or over a
towel and i can still like dip my brush
in it and it still works out fine but
I'm just afraid if I open it like
products can go everywhere and it's
going to be naught well finds me a
little bit of the mary-lou manizer but i
think the mary-lou manizer
is more on the pearl frosty side and
this is just like it's not like
champagne pop where it's like champagne
peachy but it's like in the middle of
them you know like in the middle but
opal is such a loved highlighter of so
glad that it got a little sample of it
not glad that it's broken but I mean how
it was free I guess so what do you do or
one is a champagne pop so this comes in
the packaging of the normal Becca
cosmetics highlighters it looks like a
little like UFO flying saucer am i right
but of course I got champagne pop
because this is in collaboration with
YouTube or Jaclyn hill I'm a huge fan of
jaclyn hill she's a big reason why i
like got the confidence to start YouTube
in the first place I just think that
she's great I enjoy her makeup I
listened to her recommendation since I
saw when she came out with champagne pop
I was like I know that I need to buy it
so this is what champagne pop looks like
it's a beautiful champagne II
highlighter it has like the most I mean
this is just like a perfect name but it
is gorgeous and I wear it so much i am
wearing champagne pop today I was trying
to think because I was go back and forth
between champagne pop and opal but I
decided on champagne Bob but when I was
like dipping my brush in it I'm putting
it on I was like when am I going to hit
pan on this because I've had this for
months and I mean with highlighters you
don't have to use a lot of product but I
kind of was curious like I wonder if I'm
ever going to have pan and I'm trying to
like slowly like go on the outsides not
just always hit in the middle so I feel
like the day that I see myself hit pan
on this I'm gonna be like can you
believe that but champagne pop is very
well known especially on youtube because
of jaclyn hill but it is a gorgeous
gorgeous highlighter like it's if i
didn't love it i wouldn't say i love it
i wouldn't be embarrassed to admit that
I didn't love it I guess is what I'm
saying but I do I wear it so often i'm
so happy i bought it if you are looking
for a bomb highlighter champion Bob so
those are some of my favorite products
that I give is to give my luminous
healthy glowing looking skin I know this
video is mostly focused on people who do
struggle with drier skin and if your
oily this video probably will not help
you out at all I have heard some oily
people say that they can use the l'oreal
lumen cushion and I'm not going to lie I
was pretty surprised to hear that
because I just don't feel like that
foundation would work well with oily
skin but I've seen a few YouTube videos
out here with people saying that they
are oily and they still can use it and
they just use like a mattifying primer
and then send it with like a matte
foundation and I mean hey that works for
you that's freaking awesome because i
love that foundation but so I know this
video is not necessarily for everybody
but it is just one that I've seen the
requests coming in and these are some of
my most loved products regardless like I
just enjoy these anyways and then they
help give me luminous skin which is what
I need right now as I'm staring outside
at all the freakin snow oh but I hope
