are you today hopefully quite well
today's video is going to be all about
lipsticks specifically my favorite fall
lipsticks now I have said before on my
channel and on social media that I'm not
much of a fall person because I love
summer so much fall to me represents
summer ending and winter coming and I'm
like no but for some reason I don't know
what it is this year i'm slowly
embracing more of the fall spirit
whether it comes to like fall nail
polish i've been getting so many shades
that I love doing more different things
with my makeup like this grey smokey eye
today and then especially fall lipsticks
I have just been pretty much obsessed
with them for the past few weeks so I
did just recently do the fall favorites
tag and I mentioned a few of my favorite
follow up sticks in there but I think we
were supposed to only mention like one
or two or if there are some random set
of rules out there and i think i
mentioned four and so I'm like no like
let's just pick all of my favorite
lipsticks show you all the swatches of
them talk about them which ones I like
why I like on etc and just dedicate this
to my favorite fall lipsticks because I
am such a huge lipstick person know what
it is about lipsticks because I could
buy the same like shades that are so
similar to each other but I'm like yes I
need that one too but when it comes to
things like I shadows I'm like no I just
I have one pallet that's good but
lipsticks whole other story but if you
would like to see nine of my favorite
fall lipsticks please keep watching ok
so I'm going to mention them by brands I
just think that will be easier so my
first one is going to be from l'oreal
and i only have one from l'oreal Loria
lipsticks just like smell weird to me
like like an overwhelming scent of like
old woman's perfume is what I think of
when I smell the l'oreal lipstick so I
don't have a lot of them but I really
wanted to get this from their exclusive
red collection and this is Blakes red so
I did mention this in my
all favorites video but lore'l comes out
they have the nude collection and the
red collection and a celebrity helps
design the color and whatnot so this is
Blakes read from like lively who's one
of my favorite actresses which is
basically why about the lipstick but
that's what it looks like it's just a
true classic red I mean nothing can
really beat up a red lip in the fall or
in the winter I think it's just it's
just such a beautiful red I do have a
red from Gerard cosmetics as well I
think it's called fire engine but I
actually don't like it because it looks
more like pinkish red on me where I was
looking for just like a true red and I
found that in Blake's read from l'oreal
and then I have two from Gerard
cosmetics to talk about one I did
mention in the fall favorites video and
this is 1995 it grungy like reddish
brown shade that everyone is like
obsessed with so that's what that one
looks like tix from Gerard cosmetics run
usually about $19 but if you follow them
on their social media they're really
good at having like discounts and
promotions i think i got my in a bundle
and it was it came out to be like ten
dollars a lipstick or something like
that so a little bit cheaper but again i
just i love 1995 whenever I wear it I
get so many compliments it is just so
beautiful dries matte which I really
enjoy and this one came out a while ago
it was a part of the jaclyn hill like
her collaboration that she did with
Jordan Eric's I know she is no longer
associated with droid cosmetics but 1995
and her other collabs that she did with
them are still available for sale on the
droid cosmetics website it just doesn't
say like Jacqueline's name anymore with
it but I got this one a while ago before
like the matte lip was really the
on-trend thing to do with the other one
that i have actually is another one like
in collaboration with jaclyn hill and it
is called rose hill and it's one of
their lip glosses this is this was my
first purchase that I made with droid
cosmetics I got this one her butter
cream lip gloss and then I think it was
the 1995 I got
in a Jacqueline's bundles so there they
are still available I'm drawing
cosmetics so I'm not mentioning these
line like they're not for sale anymore
they are so there even though her
affiliation with them is no longer but I
love rose hill it's such a pretty color
and especially for a lip gloss it's very
very pigmented but still a little on the
opaque side so you know that you're
wearing a gloss and not a lipstick so
that's what that one looks like the only
thing that I will say about the lip
gloss is that I think it's very sticky
on the lips and I don't really like
sticky lips but once I wear it for a
while it kind of goes away but for when
I first put it on it's a little too on
the sticky side for me but for a lip
gloss I think it's really beautiful and
I think this part is really cool it has
like a light on the wand for the lip
gloss and then it also has a mirror so
it's really easy when you're out or if
you're in the dark or in a car to apply
the lip glosses next to talk about I
have two fun color pop again these were
both mentioned in my saw favorites video
but they are just so perfect for fall
I'm getting ready to put in another
color pop order with even more of these
ultra matte liquid lipsticks because
they are bomb like if you are really
wanting to try out the liquid lipstick
trend but you don't want to spend like
the twenty dollars on anastacio cap on d
stila these are six dollars on the club
website six dollars and i love them i
think they're great personally i have
not found them super drying on the lips
the very first time that I used one I
thought like whoa this is weird this is
different it's drying on my lips but
that was the first time I'd ever used
any liquid lipstick and now i don't know
if it's just because I wear them more
but I don't notice it at all usually I
will wear a lip liner especially with
the darker colors I like to wear a lip
liner but I don't think they like
feather out or bleed or anything like
that they stay put you just need one
coat I love their liquid lipsticks but
this first shade that I have to talk
about is bumble that is bumble right
there it's a very beautiful almost again
like grungy reddish mob
kind of brown in it like with the liquid
lipsticks they do dry Matt thought it
was interesting when I first put on
bumble and it was still wet I was like I
don't think I really like this color it
was like a weird somehow like in between
reg and I was like I I don't know about
this and then it dried Matt and I was
like this is beautiful and i love it so
that's bumble the next one I have is
limbo which is basically just a brown
like it's described on the website as
chocolate brown and I got this one just
to kind of like be my wildcard and see
what it would be like I actually ended
up really liking it I've worn it in a
few videos and I think I wore it in the
fall favorites tag video and I get a lot
of really good feedback on it so that is
limbo the true brown color I like it a
lot more than I thought I would I really
didn't think it would be something that
I would wear like even outside of just
doing these YouTube videos but it really
is and it's such like if you're ever
going anywhere and you want to be an
attention grabber I mean we're brown
lipstick because people are going to
comment on it I've only had nice things
so far besides I remember wearing at
once my husband was like what what's
happening here and I'm like but it's
it's them again I'm I'm going to be
placing an order for a lot more of these
ultra matte liquid lipsticks from
colour-pop they're so affordable and I
just really enjoy them and then I have
four from Maybelline Maybelline is my
favorite drugstore brand I mean hands
down I feel like I could spend like all
day and the Maybelline and drug store
i'll add all the I feel like I spent all
day in the Maybelline aisle at
drugstores so you're silly it's it's
really crazy but especially their
lipsticks I just love i love the
formulation of them i love how like
creamy so many of them are i love the
colors I love the pigments of them I
love the price of them i recommend
Maybelline lipsticks to everybody you
know I have my 16 year old niece who's
starting to get into makeup and beauty
and she's asking me you know what
lipsticks to you recommend and I'm like
Maybelline and then I even have older
ones that are like
oh if I'm just looking for a good
lipstick color what showed you out my
family like they are so good they have
so many different colors they have
different lines they just came out with
a matte line recently and I picked up a
lipstick from there and I love it I mean
I'm just all about that Maybelline life
so I have four to share and 1 i'll share
my oldest one first this is mauve mania
so that is what that one looks like and
then that is it on my hand so that's
mauve mania when i wear it and I see
myself in camera orang pictures it looks
like pink to me but it's in person it's
much more purple it's much more on the
mob side so I don't know in camera and
pictures I think it's a lot more pink
which is kind of crazy to me but it is
definitely more Mob it's glossy it's
beautiful love is such a huge color
right now for fall and I love it then i
recently picked up one from there Matt
collection and this is called clay crush
and I said on my snapchat that I
basically bought it because I have a
crush on clay matthews from the green
bay packers and I was like why would I
now piyah looks like that's clay crush
that is what it looks like on my hand so
yes oppa so so i bought it for its name
but i heard about it on youtube i think
it was kc homes that that talked about
it and then i went to walgreens and i
was looking for it and I saw it I found
it I was like please don't be a really
crazy color like please don't be a crazy
color and I opened it and I was like oh
that color I can do and I think I
described it on my snapchat is like a
nude like pinkish brown but was like a
brush of fall to it because it just has
it's just a little bit on the deeper
side which i think is absolutely
gorgeous i love that it dries matte I
love it you know it's a matte lipstick
it's not a liquid lipstick so it's not
liquid lipsticks or more like you apply
it once and you don't need to apply it
again like you're good to go it's not
coming off yada yada I mean this is like
a regular lipstick it just has a matte
finish to it so you still can reapply it
you're not going to screw anything up
but seriously it's so gorgeous and I
think this is the most
glassing maybelline lips egg that I've
tried is from the mat collection because
I wore it I filmed the day of a Cubs
game I filmed like an hour before the
cubs game started we had people over
here we were eating we were drinking we
stayed up late the Cubs won it was
exciting and at the end of the night
like sure that faded a little bit but I
still had the color on my lips and I was
like dang that was pretty impressive for
a Maybelline lipstick so that is clay
crush then I will tell you a story so it
was the night before that I'm filming
this that i knew i was going to film a
follow-up stick video and i knew that i
had plenty of lipsticks to talk about
but I was like no I need more and I need
to find more good fall lips so I went to
alpha and originally my plan was to try
to find the new Knicks like cream suede
lipsticks which honestly I really have
not heard that much about I haven't seen
a lot about it on YouTube I've seen a
little bit on Instagram when I was going
to like the Knicks hashtags looking to
see like what's out there I started
seeing these smells like oh you know
this could be kind of cool it said
they're a lipstick but I dr.mat you know
I think it's like nixes version of the
liquid lipstick and there were like six
or seven dollars there wasn't too many
shades maybe like eight and so honestly
my mind I was like well I'll just go to
Alta and pick up each shade i can do a
whole video about him you know see what
I think about him could be something
really cool go to ulta and I had I had
in my mind that I was gonna buy all of
them but then I was like if I you know
decide that I can't get them all or not
out there I have think it was like for
specific shades that I really want to
get those four shades sold out and I
asked though there was a lady walking
around the store and I was like do you
have any more of these shades and she's
like which ones are you looking for i go
every shade that's not here like do you
have more of those and she scanned him
and she's like I'm sorry we're all out
of them they've just been flying off the
shelves I went to the Alta website sold
out i went to the knicks website sold
out I'm like of course why not story of
my life with lipsticks anyways I calmed
myself down I you know put myself
together and then I went to the
Maybelline islands now I'm so fine I'm
just gonna buy me
and although I was having a buy one get
one fifty percent off or Maybelline I
was like perfect let's do it so I picked
up two more lipsticks and then I was
like I need to try these lipsticks out
because I can't come here on camera and
be like I love these lipsticks and I
haven't even like opened the tube yet so
last night I was snapchatting you guys
and I had no makeup on it was a Friday
night I was designated driver to my
husband who was at a party for a friend
I was saying home all night and working
totally bare face but then I had bright
lipstick on and I was snapchatting you
guys letting you know what was going on
that I was testing it out I wanted to
see how it worked I wanted to see how it
lasted yada yada yada so I kept it on
for probably about four or five hours
I'd say and then this morning I got up
and I immediately before I even did my
makeup I put the other lipstick on word
around the house it's now afternoon that
I'm filming this because I wanted to be
able to give my honest feedback and even
though i bought them for the fall
lipstick video if i didn't like him
where they didn't work out for me i
wasn't going to mention them obviously
i'm still going to keep him would be
just fine with it but i wasn't going to
mention them in this video but of course
it's maybelline they worked out and I
love them I'm not surprised I'm not
surprised that that happened I was so
happy because with the Maybelline
discount and then I had some Alta coupon
as well these ended up being like 350
apiece I was like yes but the colors
that I got our rum Richie and deepest
cherry and I decided to go a darker
wrote with these because liquid
lipsticks I really do like and I really
do think they're great i love how they
look especially the colour-pop ones i
love the finish of them etc but with the
darker lipsticks and even with bumble
and limbo that i talked about from
colour-pop cosmetics something very
unattractive can happen and that is like
the inner rim of your lips liquid
lipstick will not stay on there and so
when you talk or when you like do any
sort of faces like that it legit looks
like you have butthole lips and it's not
attractive at all and it makes me
worried too
are those liquid lipsticks like out in
public or if I'm going to be gone for a
long time whatever because I'm like now
I don't know what my lips look like did
I still look okay do I need to try to
reapply just to the inner rim it just I
don't love it so I'm definitely more
attracted to the lighter side of the
liquid lipsticks I have MIDI and sallow
from colour-pop as well favorites I mean
I wear them all of the time you still do
kind of get that but with the lighter
shades it's not as noticeable from like
having brown on your lips and then your
inner lip is like the light pink I mean
it just hang at the plethora of
Maybelline lipsticks I was like let's go
a dark route because that way I can
still wear my dark lip out when I want
to but I won't have that same fear
because with these glossy lip sticks you
can reapply without any problems you
don't have that inner lip issue let's go
that route so that's why I picked the
two that I did and the first one is rum
Richie and that is what that one looks
like this is the one that I wore last
night i got some really nice snaps back
from you guys about it even though I was
like it's kind of hard to tell because
I'm not wearing any other lips any other
makeup like it's kind of hard to judge
your lipstick when you have like a
totally bare face no eyeshadow on no
bronzer know anything so that one is rum
Richie feel really weird to be swatching
on my right hand and like trying to
swatch with my love I can do anything
left hand it's really bad but I love
this one because it's so glossy and
pretty it is it's like um the reddish
brown I feel like I use the same words
to describe so many lipsticks which is
funny but I honestly I don't feel like I
have something like this in my
collection which I'm really excited
about it's reddish brown but i would say
more on the brown side I'm trying to
look at all my swatches to think like
does it look like anything else I think
maybe it would be closest to like 1995
but 1995 from drug cosmetics is Matt and
this is glossy and I just thought it was
so beautiful it's kind of got like hints
of a richer brown to it which I really
really liked
out of it so that was rum Richie and
then today and this is what I'm wearing
right now is deepest cherry and the name
stuck out to me right away I was like I
know that I'm not gonna have anything
like this in my collection I gotta get
it I put it on today and I was like oh
yes girl I mean even when I opened it
and looked at the tube in Alta I was
like we're gonna get that one watching
them on my hands I'm like oh so creamy
and nice like I just love it so that
last one is deepest cherry I just oh the
minute I started to put it on my lips I
was like mmm yes i will say i probably
have like I probably went back probably
three times over with it because the
first time I applied it it wasn't like
super dark the second time I applied it
I was like oh yeah I like that and then
the third time I applied it I was like
love it quite well so I have a feeling
that this one is probably going to be
like when I really want that kind of
like darker almost like vampy look this
is the 1 i'm going to use because i just
think it is so pretty again i'm
comparing the swatches on my hand I
don't have anything I don't have
anything that really even comes close to
this one which is awesome i didn't think
i did but i love it very very glossy
very pigmented like i said goes on so
well on the lips Maybelline I mean it's
not the most longest lasting lipstick in
the entire world but it doesn't strap I
mean take it with you reapply it's great
especially if you can find it at a
drugstore at all so you have some sort
of coupon like I said these two that I
bought were 350 apiece and I mean like
how do you how do you beat that I think
that's pretty amazing but I'm so so
happy i decided to make that late night
run and I'll keep looking for the Knicks
lipsticks but I don't have a good
feeling about it but those were my last
ones from Maybelline and just in general
okay so that is my entire fall favorite
lip swatch video here's all the swatches
again i'll post a picture on instagram
as well of each of the
watches what is this one what's this one
over here is this something that's not
something right did something robe off
something must have rubbed up I have no
idea they're just some of my favorites
i'm really glad that as i look at the
swatches like i said maybe that is rum
richie in 1995 those are probably the
closest but again the finishes are
different ones Matt one is glossy but
other than that they're pretty different
which makes me happy but if you're
looking for more lipsticks in general or
more lipstick specifically towards the
fall season I really hope this video
helped you I have I mean basically this
is really more on the Affordable side
the most expensive ones would be the
drug cosmetics and like I said you can
usually find some sort of discount code
through their Instagram or through their
website i know they have a lot of other
affiliates to that usually have some
sort of discount code so really i mean
this is a pretty affordable video too i
didn't realize that until right now so
yay thumbs up for affordable makeup we
all love that especially when you're
buying a crazy amount of lipsticks
because you just can't stop but i really
do hope you found this video helpful and
enjoyable if you did please be sure to
give it a thumbs up if there's any other
specific makeup videos that you want to
see whether it's like just on one brand
or on a certain lip product like
lipsticks if there's something else that
you want to see as well please just
comment below and let me know I would
love to hear any of your comments
feedback suggestions would absolutely
love it I will leave everything that I
talked about linked in the description
box below I should be able to find links
to everything that I've talked about I'm
pretty sure the only one I'm not
positive about is the Blake spread from
l'oreal it came out like last year
Christmas and for some reason I read
that it was like a limited edition
collection I actually really struggled
to find Blake's read because it seemed
like once the drug stores were out at
the lipsticks they weren't getting them
back in stock so it took me a while to
track down that lipstick but i will try
i don't know maybe they brought them
back full time that's the only one I'm
kind of unsure about but I will try to
link everything in the description box
below I think that's all I have to say
again I really hope you enjoyed this
video I enjoyed doing it for you and
getting these lips
for you because I'm such a lipstick
junkie if you guys have favorite fall
lipsticks as well please leave in the
comments below because I would love to
know what you guys are loving on because
like i said i'm going to be placing a
few orders here and there I have one for
color pop in mind I also have one for
dose of colors in mind and I want to get
my hands on those Knicks lipsticks if
you've used them try them let me know or
just tell me if I'm wasting my time
trying to find them just be like no just
buy more Maybelline is it you guys have
a wonderful day I will see you in my
