today's video I'm going to be doing my
top 10 books of 2015 so we got another
top 2015 video going on I planned on
doing this video like it was in my mind
to do the video because every year
around this time on Chiclets plus I put
a post together for the website of all
my favorite books and so this year I was
like I should do a YouTube video as well
but I actually got a couple requests to
do the video which made me so happy i
love when you guys request things so I
was like yes I will do it too but I will
have a link in the description box below
as well to the post on Chiclets Plus as
well as all the titles that I mention
and there amazon links and the link to
my review so i do have 10 books from
2015 that i read that i wanted to give a
special mention to and then i have five
like special honorable mentions so
technically this is my top 15 books of
2015 but you'll see what i mean at the
end so i am back in this like filming
space I actually still had it set up
from the past video that I recorded so I
was like why not do it again today your
guys's feedback I've been really good
you say that you like it so I'm going to
keep trying to film I know there are
some things that I won't be able to do
up here especially like makeup tutorials
because I don't have anything around to
me I don't have a desk or a table and it
would be too hard like reaching to get
things so I need to be in my office
where I have my desks but I'll keep
trying here i'm looking for like fun and
backgrounds but i haven't been able to
find any yet but i have a few more
stores that i want to get to the hardest
part being in here is getting my camera
height right I don't know why it's so
different from being in my office to
being up here but like I can't seem to
get it correct yet but I'm gonna keep
working on it so just a quick note but
yes why don't we hop in and see my
favorite books that i read and i'm just
going to do these in chronological order
so what i did on chocolate plus i have a
tab for book reviews and then i have a
tab for CLP favorites and that is five
stars from anyone on my review team
i also have a tab for Samantha's
favorites and that just helps me keep
track for purposes like this so i just
clicked on that tab i took it all the
way back to january first and start it
from there i had so many five star
reviews in 2015 and i can leave that
link below to my favorites so you guys
can check them out but these are like my
top 10 that when i saw them on my list i
was like have to mention these so these
were like my favoritest favorite books
you know what I'm saying the first one
is new uses for old boyfriends and this
is by Beth Kendrick I absolutely love
Beth Kendricks books i think i have
brought all of them have talked about
her several times on this channel I just
reviewed one of her newest releases so
new uses for old boyfriends as a part of
the black dog bay series and it's a
really really cute still series and
story but I think you guys should check
them out I just read the most recent one
in it it's called put a ring on it and I
like that one as well but new uses for
old boyfriends I just thought was like
top of the line definitely a book to
check out the next one I have is the
seeds of a daisy and this is by Alison
caiola and this book was so good i
remember reading it and just
recommending it to everybody i
recommended it to like my friends i
recommended it like my mom I just
thought it was such a good book and it
is a part of the lily lockwood series we
follow the main character Lily Lockwood
and then there is a follow-up book to it
that is called the silver cord and I
also gave that one five stars so I did
want to mention that in here as well but
i really loved both the books but
especially the seeds of a daisy i
thought was such a good book it is
emotional I did cry while reading it but
it's just it was such a beautiful raid
and I'm happy to say that I've kind of
like made friends now with the author
and I hope she releases more soon so I'd
know I almost do not film today because
my hair is like on another level and I
feel like I keep pulling hair out of my
head and like throwing it on my yoga mat
which is
below me it is so like whoosh one of my
new year's resolutions make a hair
appointment that's a good one the next
one I have is twin peaks and this is by
Tracy Bannister Tracy is someone who I
interact with on you know a daily basis
in the social media world she is such a
talented writer but she is such a lover
of books and a lover of other authors
and I just I just think that she is
super fabulous but I also love to Twin
Peaks it is chicklet and it is very
funny like I remember laughing my way
throughout the book especially because
one of the sisters in the book is a pet
psychic and I remember it just like
killing me reading those scenes and
thinking about if I could have someone
come and like speak to Ares who's my
dawg and oh my gosh I just I had such a
good time reading it they're surprises
in there as well and I just think it's
definitely one to check out if you are a
lover of Chiclets the next one I have is
a love at first flight and this is my
test woods ah this book this book is so
good it's one of those books that will
make you sink long after you've read it
like as I'm thinking about the book
right now I'm again thinking about the
situations that the characters were in
and what I think I would do and what I
would have done differently in the same
and it's one that makes you talk one
that makes you think I absolutely loved
it I freaking adore this author so much
I can't even tell you like our situation
that me and Tess have is one of the
biggest reasons why i love so much what
I do and why I'm so passionate about the
work I do test contacted me through
chiclet plus you know asked me to review
her book I did I loved it I put it on
chocolate plus I gave it five stars I
talked about it here on YouTube she was
sharing my review everywhere she shared
the YouTube videos everywhere she was so
kind to me we talked like probably
weekly we talked on social media we just
check in with each other see how each
other are and she's just she's such a
beautiful soul like you I just even
though I've never met
her I feel like we are friends and I was
so blown away that she included my
fourth novel up to up to i do on her
like 2015 must-reads list I was so blown
away I was not expecting that she was so
sweet that after I did the reviews for
her and you know talked about it on
YouTube she actually facebook messaged
me and was like hey i just bought your
book up to i do and was like oh my god
thank you because things like that just
don't happen a lot or if they do you
know not someone someone doesn't always
tell you so you don't always know you
can't say thank you and she did it and
she reviewed it and then she put it on
her must reads list and I was just blown
away by the kindness from her that had
nothing to do with me putting her on my
list because this book is hands-down an
absolute must-read even if I didn't know
the author even if we didn't have any
interaction this book would have been on
there because it was so good so hard to
put down definitely a must read has the
knockoff and this is viet Lucy Sykes and
Jill Piazza and this book kills us it
was I'm dreading the best bird that I
want to use to describe it and I would
just describe it as like cute and funny
and good like it was just a good well
written thoughtful energetic book to
read and I just had a fabulous time
reading it one that I definitely
recommend of course I give it five stars
because I give all of these book five
stars but it was so humor as it had me
laughing it also helped had me thinking
and even though me and the main
character are not close in age we're not
close in careers I still felt like we
could be friends I still felt like I
could connect with her and I feel like
that's a really good way of knowing when
something is well written that even
though you might not have anything to do
with each other you can still understand
what that character is thinking why
she's doing what she's doing and you can
still connect on some level and that is
what this book did for me another quick
note i also can't find anything to wear
today i'm wearing sweatpants currently
because we had eight
of snow outside and I don't want to get
out of my sweatpants but I just could
not find the top to wear and I was going
to wear a sweater I was like seven of
synthetic don't don't worry as my chart
and so I put this top on so I like
purple nail polish on and then I like
still wasn't feeling it so then i put on
my Mirena necklace and it made me feel
pretty so don't mind don't mind my pink
necklace if you guys like it i talked
about it in one of my previous videos
but i am now an affiliate with marina
collections and they send me this
beautiful Andy necklace but I do have a
coupon code for twenty percent off if
you guys like statement jewelry I
suggest checking them out or if you know
someone you need to buy a gift for
someone I'll leave a link in the
description box below for you to check
it out but it does it just it just
really helped pep up my mood so it's
best of enemies by jen lancaster i'm a
big fan of jen lancaster i think i've
read nearly all of her books and i
really enjoy them a lot best of enemies
was when i actually write as an
audiobook and to be super honest I feel
like the audio might have like played
into my decision into giving this a
five-star book I thought it was great I
thought I was well written I thought it
was witty I thought the pace was really
well but I thought the narrator's did
such a good job in this book this book
was narrated so so well I was so
impressed with it I remember walking my
dog in the summer listening to this book
and audio and just laughing while i was
walking hoping no one was gonna walk by
and like think i was a crazy lady but I
feel like even if I didn't listen to it
in audio even if I had just read it in a
book I still would have loved it because
it was such a funny book there was just
some like totally hysterical moments in
here and it is fiction jen lancaster
also writes nonfiction but the best of
enemies is fiction and i loved it then i
have on here wake-up call and this is by
Amy and Vince II know this book was
definitely a book that made you think
what would you do if you were that
character and if you guys can't tell I
love those books I love being able to
try to put myself into someone else
shoes and think okay if I woke up one
day and my last i think is four years of
memories are gone how would I react I
went from being someone that was totally
set on my career path and all of a
sudden I wake up one day and I have a
husband and I have children and I don't
work how did you get from point A to
point B what would you do oh my gosh it
was so thoughtful and so well-written
and i feel like i'm going to keep using
these same adjectives and every book
that i talked about but it's so true
this book was just so great there is
another book coming I don't know when
it's coming out yet but I know this is
part of the wake up series and I cannot
wait to read what she has in store for
us next next one I have is if you only
knew and this is by kristan higgins this
is actually another one that I listen to
as an audiobook though I while the
narration was good and great and I
actually think there might have been an
overlapping narrators from this one in
the gen Lancaster one like the narration
didn't blow me away or anything like it
did in the best of enemies but I really
really liked this book because we have
two sides we have two different sisters
and we kind of follow their point of
views and each one again was so well
written and it made me think but this
book is one like the reason I put it on
my list is because it brought up so many
emotions in me it made me furious it
made me sad and it made me want to kick
things at maybe want to yell at people
it made me want to hug someone like this
book kristan higgins did such a
wonderful job writing this book and
writing the emotions that it really made
me feel those emotions and it was like a
roller coaster reading this book and I
felt like I was right in there with her
and these characters and so I just
really had to include it for that reason
because not a lot of books can bring out
such a passionate side like that the
next one I have is Plan B and this is by
Hilary Grossman now Hilary is someone
who I definitely consider our friend I
think we talked to each other every
single
day via email or social media I do also
do like marketing work with her so I was
kind of like should I put this on my
list join up with this on my list but I
love the book so much whether or not i
work with her because i have read
Hillary's first book which is dangled
carrot I read that long before we ever
works in any sort of professional
setting together and I loved it and I
loved Hillary and so that's why I felt
okay putting it on my list because I was
like I know even if I didn't know her I
would still love these books Hillary is
such a passionate writer and she's so
invested in her books and her in her
career as a writer and I admire that so
much about her I look up to her I think
she does amazing things with her books
and with her marketing side she is so
vocal on social media she's always
talking to her readers which is
something that you know I see her
interact so much with her readers and I
like make sure you do that yourself
Samantha like you love when I thursday's
up to you you got to make sure you're
saying back to them when they're saying
thanks to you so I just love it dangled
carrot I'm sure it was on my favorites
list of 2014 so be sure to check that
one out too Bun B was my favorite for
2015 and I loved the mother-daughter
relationship in this book I mean that's
basically what this book does focus
around and there is such a twist at the
end then I remember reading it for the
first time before the book was published
and just being like oh my gosh it was so
much fun to read definitely wanted to
check out and then my tenth book that I
have on here is whisper if you need me
and this is by dina silver i just
recently reviewed this one so it's very
fresh in my mind it is i believe the
only book on my list that is why a the
characters that we follow our in their
teens and they are at a like summer camp
need to get away for the summer I never
went to one of those but they sound like
a good time yes I just recently read
this one Deena silver is another one
who I just love her I mean I feel like
we're friends because we do talk on
social media but like she's probably why
if she watches this not saying that she
will watch it when she'll watch and be
like better not friends what are you
saying but I just think that she is so
much fun to follow on social media if
you don't follow her you should because
she's funny and she's honest and
sometimes she's a little bit brutal out
there but she gives it to you real and I
really appreciate that about her I
followed her career from the very
beginning when she was a self-published
author and now she is just doing so many
great things she comes out with
fantastic books I really enjoyed that
she came out with a why a book and I
enjoyed reading it so much I was a
little hesitant to read it because i'm
not a huge white girl but I was like
it's Dina you're gonna love it and I
loved it so that is booked and number
ten I'm I'll have my five honorable
mentions and these are all books that
were published from my publishing
company marching inc in 2015 so I'm so
proud of each and every one of these
books and I just wanted to give them a
special mention even though you know
obviously I'm very biased because I put
a lot of work into these books and they
all mean something to me one of them is
my own but these were all five titles
that we published in 2015 we did also
put out a collection called 20-something
it has three titles from myself Kat
lavoie and Laura Chapman it has three of
our already published novels in there we
just kind of throw them into a
collection but these are all four of
them are stand-alones and one is the
holiday collection that we recently put
out but the first one that we published
in 2015 I'm pretty positive i think this
was in February is the marrying type and
this is by Laura Chapman and I love
wedding books I love wedding books so
much they just make me so happy but this
one the main character is a wedding
planner and I mean I'm sure you guys
have heard me talk about these books so
much I don't know how much i should say
but i'll say there's wedding planning
involved there's reality TV involved
an ex-boyfriend that makes an appearance
so another one that was published was up
to I do this is by Smith March that's me
um I'm really proud of this book this is
my wedding photo if you guys can see
that that's my my actual wedding picture
I kind of had that in mind this book
does not have anything to do with my
wedding but like a wealthy hotel heiress
that is getting married to just as
wealthy of a man and while I like to
thank me and my husband are doing okay
for ourselves we're not like anything in
the book and I just I had so much fun
writing this book because it's dedicated
to my grandmother who has passed away
but she had a lot to do with the book
there's a grams character that I wrote
that helps Emerson along with her
journey of wedding planning and how
stressful it can be and how Brides can
kind of like lose themselves in the
moment of planning their wedding and
this big crazy event and you kind of
forget about you know maybe what your
wedding is actually signifying and the
grandma is there to help remind her of
those things and it was just really
special for me to write because I just
envisioned it as what my grandma would
be doing for me when I was wedding
planning now I'm going to cry another
one that was published is a
first-and-goal and this is by Laura
Chapman this is the first book in the
queen of the league series a released
writer on the time of NFL kickoff season
which was in September and I'm very
excited because book 2 is coming out of
January 27th it is available for
pre-order now I can leave those links
below but that is called going for two
and so excited for you guys to read that
one and be like football fans out there
like you guys have to read this you
don't have to be a football fan in order
to understand what's happening but
basically the main character Harper
joints a fantasy football league in
order to try to like make more friends
she has just moved to a new city new job
new people she needs it works at a car
dealership so she's mainly around men
and joins their fantasy football team in
order to try to like make friends meet
new people and then there's romance I
love it so excited for the second one to
come out
as you guys a little bit too when we put
out is Perry in progress and this is by
cat lavoie and I love this cover I think
is so adorable the book is so Chiclets
like cat is such a good chocolate writer
this is her third novel and with each
book that she comes up with I'm just
like you go girl I love cat I've had the
pleasure of meeting her a couple
different times at book signings and
book events and she is the sweetest she
cares so much about her books and what
she's putting out there for people and
has such a passion about putting out
quality top-of-the-line books that's so
amazing of her and I just I love being
able to work with her she's the first
author that's signed with marching ink
and she will always hold a special place
in my heart so this is Perry and
progress and then the final one that we
just put out around holiday season is
all i want for christmas and this has
for holiday novellas inside one from me
one from cat and then two from Laura
Chapman so you get a total of four
little holiday themed novellas in here
so it's a short story and it basically
equals to like one book I was so proud
of it I absolutely loved doing a
collection like this it was our first
holiday collection with marching ink and
I'm so happy with the way it turned out
and the response it got people seem to
just love these holiday books and so I
hope we get to do another windows where
