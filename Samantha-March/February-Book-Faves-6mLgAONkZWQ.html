today's video is going to be a favorites
video this is only the book favorites
for the month of februari it's just
going to be a quick video I think we
only have like four books to share
reason being one of the main reviewers
for Chiclets plus took month of februari
off so we just didn't have as many
reviews in general on Chiclets plus
because she's one who does like the
majority of the reviews so she took the
month off so we didn't have as many book
reviews in February which means we
obviously didn't have as many favorites
as we would normally have so just have a
couple books to talk about I kind of
wondered about whether to share the
video are not but you know I can't leave
these books out just because we don't
have a lot to talk about in this video
doesn't mean I can't give the books the
recognition that they deserved I think
two of them were from me and so I
figured I can kind of go a little bit
more in depth into why I really enjoyed
them but yeah if you would like to see
the chiclet plus februari book favorites
please keep that we have is a seven
crush and this is by Camila ously and
christy is the one that we viewed this
and she mentioned in her review that the
book was just very humorous it made her
laugh out loud a lot she giggled the
whole way through the book and actually
thought it was great looks like we
follow a book editor who is going on a
honeymoon but while on the plane ride to
the Caribbean there's like a storm and
they end up on a deserted island i think
it was and like trying to survive and
there's a story line with the guy that
the main character sitting next to on
the plane so sounds like a great
Chiclets book and Christie gave this one
five stars next one I have is up and in
by Deborah Disney and I recently hauled
this book and I said that I was excited
just based on the cover to read the book
because the cover just immediately
grabbed my attention and this one I just
think it's so interesting because it's
definitely like mommy lips which right
now is like a very popular sub-genre out
there but basically we're following a
mom that gets kind of like caught up and
almost like like keeping up with the
Joneses type of thing where they really
want their daughter to like have the
best education and go to the best school
and while there she meets a group of
other moms who are like the very cliquey
type always trying to outdo one another
you know they have to have the best of
the best I have to talk about how they
have the best of the best and Maria is
trying to figure out like how she fits
in and she kind of like finds herself
getting caught up and like I need to
wear the best clothes I need to make
sure i have my hair done and so you know
she starts to become accustomed to the
certain ways of doing things and it
definitely causes some problems in her
marriage and it causes problems with
herself with her daughter and she kind
of tries to figure out like the the
right balance for everything and I just
ate this book up I could not put it down
I thought it was so good and I mentioned
in my review that I am such a huge fan
of these mommy lip books I absolutely
love them which i think is very funny
for me because I don't have any children
so I have no experience to go off of but
it's like I just get lost in this world
and i think it is crazy and you know I
kind of see so many people around me
playing that game like you always have
to be better or have the best thing or
have the biggest house or drive a
certain car and I'm not about that life
like that would make me way too tired I
just have to do me otherwise i'd
probably go out of my mind but so i can
feel like i can relate to these
characters and how Maria's trying not to
get caught up in it then she like starts
to get caught up in it and she keeps
saying like el it's for my daughter it's
for my daughter it's for my daughter but
then we kind of like peel back the
layers and I just I loved it i can't say
enough good things about it i definitely
gave it a big ol five star review so
happy to read this if you are looking
for a great one check out up and in by
deborah disney alright guys the next one
i have is the widow this is by fiona
barton i mentioned this in my haul video
that when I hauled this book that when I
like every once in a while I need to
step outside of my comfort zone when it
comes to reading I need to read and new
genre something that on first glance is
something that I would usually pass off
pass off to my review team and when I
got the review request for the widow I
read through the synopsis i looked at
the cover and I just thought like
okay this could be a good one for you
and so I decided to review it even
though it's not chocolate women's
fiction romance romantic comedy Chiclets
mystery it's none of my Chandra's that I
would normally gravitate towards it's
more of like a psychological thriller oh
my word where I actually thought about
doing a video Jess on this book alone
but I don't know I feel like the whole
time I'd be like and then and then and
then whoa and then what happened and
like literally I feel like that would be
like what my video would be like but it
was so crazy because I was reading this
book while eating one day like my
husband was watching TV and I was at the
table i was eating something but i'm
still reading the book i was on a very
tight deadline to read this book i
started reading it late so i was just
reading it all the time which was not a
problem because i loved it so much but
i'm reading it at the table and i just
go oh my ship huh was like are you okay
like are you joking you're not like a
food what's going on in like this book I
can't I can't this book OMG I guess I
definitely like a psychological thriller
suspense novel basically we're following
the widow who is gene her husband had a
whole case of possibly abducting a young
girl and killing her but the body was
never found and as we're reading we're
getting point of views from several
people including the like police
detective that was on the case of this
little Bella's disappearance and going
through like the possible suspects and
then the whole time we're also getting
the widow's point of view and worsening
flashbacks of her her marriage to her
husband and kind of how he treated her
we learned that he has you know like a
porn addiction this is during a time
when chat rooms were becoming very
popular and the whole you can make
yourself whoever you want to be on the
internet and he possibly was involved
with things like that and the whole time
I was like
I'm pretty sure he did it right like he
he took that little girl right but I was
never really quite sure and then as
we're getting more into the widow story
we find out that she and her husband
were not able to have children and she
became like obsessed with having a child
and she would make scrapbooks out of
like pictures of babies and children and
she clearly had something going on too
and so then I started thinking did they
both take the little girl and if they
both took the little girl where is the
little girl now and just as you're
reading each chapter i'm getting full on
goosebumps right now thinking about
reading that book because as I'm
breeding each chapter I'm getting more
and more like I'm a little confused and
then I think I know what's going on and
then I'm not sure anymore and then we
have other suspects coming into play
there's a whole trial that plays out in
there and wow it was incredible this is
one that I highly highly highly
recommend even if this is not your
normal genre but you're someone like me
who likes to step out of the comfort
zone every once in a while just to get a
peek just to like step your toe bow out
there and see what else is beyond those
doors I suggest this one it was
fantastic the last one that we have is
if I run and this is by Terry Blackstock
and Mary reviewed this one and just by
kind of like reading the synopsis and
then marries review it seems like it's
maybe along the same lines of the widow
I'm saying that without seeing exactly
what the genre is for short looks like
there is a murder there's a murder
investigation Casey is the main
character it looks like she's a prime
suspect in the murder of one of her best
friends it looks like Casey probably
runs i'm thinking maybe that's where the
title comes in and then there's like a
detective that is trying to find her and
then Casey has a whole past of like why
she doesn't trust the police that you're
kind of sounds like you're reading that
as well and another one that sounds
really really good and marry details are
on the five starbucks that chocolate
plus had in the month of februari i hope
you enjoyed this short little video also
we don't mind that I'm like pretty bare
faced because I wasn't planning on
filming and then I just
I should just do it and I just could not
bring myself to like put a full-face
makeup on I just have a bunch of like
Milani Luminoso on some highlight and
some mascara called it a day I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please do
give it a thumbs up if you liked seeing
these book reviews and the book
favorites coming in I'll being able to
give the five-star books that chocolate
floss gifts I love to be able to give
them the recognition and it seems like
authors like the tweets that I get in
the comments that I get authors just
find it so much fun that their books are
being broadcasted on youtube because
normally it's like I mean especially for
me like the books are on blogs and
Goodreads and yeah we're putting it on
social media but not a lot on youtube so
it's a lot of fun to see the tweets back
from authors like this is so cool my
book is being mentioned on youtube so
I'm really glad to be able to do these
videos um so hope you liked it I really
wanted to come on here and do February's
favorites even though there's only four

regular schedule in March if not April

March goes but I hope you all have a
fantastic day thank you so much for
