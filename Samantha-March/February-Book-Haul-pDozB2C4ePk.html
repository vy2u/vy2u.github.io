video I'm going to be sharing a Bilal
you guys so this is just going to be a
bunch of the books that I have recently
been sent to either from like authors or
publishers or blog tour companies that
sort of thing I haven't done a book haul
since like last month I don't think so i
think i actually have quite a few to
share today so why don't we just harder
on the menu and this is by Zanna
Mackenzie this was sent to me samoh is
an author was the CLP blog tours which
is the blog for company that I run and I
wanted to read this because i really
enjoy like these little mystery type
books so i signed up to read it myself
it says from amazon Lizzie carter
desperately needed to escape from the
disaster for old life but her new one is
shaping up to be even worse looks like
AG Lizzie's new boss as a celebrity chef
and he has stabbed in his own kitchen
and let's Lizzy finds herself at the top
of the suspect list so it's got food and
Scott mystery I'm probably going to like
this one the next one I have is change
of plans and this is by mila rossi i
recently i believe maybe in like my
january book reviews i mentioned may
allah razi i just recently read wild
games from her and so she asked me if i
wanted to read change of plans and
because i enjoyed both games i said yes
from amazon it says sarah thompson is a
25 year old girl in the mission go to
her friends office party find an
attractive guy and lose her virginity
when she meets rough and rugged jason
hendrix she's no she's found her one
night stand okay so so that'll be an
interesting one the next on that i have
is the witches of cambridge and this is
by Nina Van Praagh not really an idea if
I'm saying that correctly i'm actually
reading this one next after i finish the
current book i'm reading this is the one
that i will be reading from amazon it
says for fans of alice huffman sarah
addison allen in adriana trigiani The
Witches of Cambridge reveals an
astonishing world where the heart's
deepest secrets and give voi to the
magic of life-changing love and so let's
be careful what you wish for if you're a
witch you might just get it and i think
it was in my january book review
so I talked about how much I love like
magical realism and how I was such a big
fan of charmed and all that sort of good
stuff so when I see books like this I'm
like I'm going to read you the next two
books I have are in a part of a series
and these are both of us with CLP blog
tours as well the first one is tangle of
thorns this is by Laurel Clayton and it
is booked one in the Eva thorne novel
and it's a little like fantasy romance
type of reeds so it's it's a little bit
different from what I would normally
read but I try every once in a while to
get out of my comfort zone I'm actually
doing that right now I'm reading the
widow by Fiona Barton and it's more of
like a psychological thriller like
domestic suspense type novel and not
what I normally read but again i'd like
to do that every once in a while to
switch it up and the widow is proving to
be very very good i just posted on
Instagram above it from amazon it says
femme fatale turns hard-boiled
investigator in this verse Eva thorne
novel said in a fantasy world where
magic and machines can't stand against
the god of death humans are on the run
from the gods invasion so and then we go
to book to which is called a thorn for a
crown so i will be reading this after i
read the first book so a sequel i'm
assuming it's going to be set in like
the same area but it says the first real
case femme fatale turned private I Eva
Thorne has had in months maybe more than
she can handle King regard has been
kidnapped only he's not entirely alive
which makes finding him difficult what's
more dwarf men are joining the stuff I
guess movements in droves to win freedom
from the matriarchy and there's a
werewolf terrace in town causing chaos
so sounds like a super interesting
series for me I'm really glad that I got
not only book one but book 2 as well so
I can kind of like keep going and those
are from what I see there's just the two
books right now I don't know if there
will be a third but the app books 1 and
2 are available them the next one I have
actually isn't on amazon yet it is
called the big interview and this is by
libby kirsch i recently read
reviewed at the Bakley de baile beaker
she was mentioned in maybe like my
December January favorites video because
I gave it five stars and I really loved
it and I'm very excited that Libby reach
out to me again and she asked me to read
book two in the series which is called
the big interview so I can leave the
links below to my review for the big
lead so you guys can check that out I
don't have anything really to say about
the big interview because I there's
nothing really for me to go on I live
right now if I'm very excited to get
some to copy for that because I love the
book so much again all the books that I
mentioned our amazon links will be in
the description box below in case any of
these catch your eye and you want to
check them out the next one that I have
is a mug shot and this is by Carolyn
ferdig and this is a part of her java
jive mystery this book does not come out
until April nineteenth so I got like a
pretty early review copy of it but I've
also read death before decaf I've
reviewed it here and i loved it i love
these type of like mystery books like
Chiclets mr. books discover i thought
was super cute for mug shot as well so
i'm very excited to read it from amazon
it is available right now on amazon for
pre-order it says with the humor and
suspense of janet Ivanych stephanie plum
novels the java jive series heats up as
the irresponsible heroine of death
before decaf faces off against
Nashville's upper crust to solve a
shocking murder i'm pretty sure i'm
probably going to love this one too but
very excited to get there all the books
that i have been sent to you read and
review in the next couple weeks and
months here I'm very excited I think I
