excited for today's video obviously it
is something a little bit different for
my channel but I am doing a festival
inspired makeup look so that explains
what this is all about I had so much fun
with this video and trying to be more
creative and come up with different
something a different look to do on my
channel i have actually not only done
something like this not on my channel
but i've never done anything like this
in real life even I've never been to
Coachella or any like music festivals
like that I go to a lot of like rock
concert some vague rock fan and I try to
do fun things they're like with my liner
or with my lips things like that but
I've never liked gone full out like this
and I had such a fun time doing it this
video is actually a collab with Leslie's
guide or less Lee's guide to being a
lady she is my friend on YouTube and
Instagram but honestly I think we talked
on snapchat a whole lot more we talk
almost every single day and she reached
out to me and asked if I wanted to do
this look and I said yes and I was so so
excited to do it and so excited to
collab with her I will be sure to leave
her links below to her YouTube and
Instagram I hope you will check her out
her videos are so much fun that she does
someone who is much more creative than I
am and I've been going through her
videos and watching even like her older
ones before I subscribe to her channel
and I'm just like dang girl you kill it
so please go subscribe to her Channel
show her some love I'll let her know
that i sent you i'm so excited to see
the look that she came up with as well i
can't wait to watch her video beyond
this has just been so much fun to do
something different out of the box
creative i had to really think about it
i swear this is going to be such an
awkward tutorial and I think I
at one point cuz like some things were
going right and then some things went
wrong and that I had to change a few
different things and then I added in a
few things I didn't expect to do so it
was just kind of all over the place but
again just so much fun to do I hope you
guys like this video know something a
little bit different and unless you're
going to a festival or somewhere fun
like that you probably won't be able to
wear this makeup but everyone's been
doing these fun festival looks and I'm
just so happy that I decided to get in
on it Thank You Leslie for clubbing with
me so excited to see your video but now
if you would like to see how I achieved
this festival inspired makeup look so I
have most of my face already done just
because this look is going to be so like
I focus that's where all the attention
is going to be I have like my foundation
and my concealer and my blush on and
contour bronzer that's all on so I'm
just going to hop right into the eyes
the first thing that I'm going to grab
is the morphe 35o palette this is brand
new for me this is going to be the very
first time I'm using it but I saw this
orange color right here right at the end
I saw this orange color and I was like
okay okay I'm somehow going to
incorporate orange in here and then I've
been watching a few snaps at Coachella
and I saw that Kylie Jenner has orange
wig on and I was like yes I knew I was
on something with the warm right so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to pick up
the morphe 441 brush it looks like this
it's just a blending brush is really
long and I don't know I felt like this
brush would be the best thing for what I
want to do I have not attempted this
look I have no idea what I'm about to do
or what I'm about to look like but
basically I want to take the orange and
I want to start it from like my eyebrow
and blend it down so start from my bro
blend it down that's totally different
usually I start in the crease and blend
up and blend down or start down and go
up it's going to be really different but
I want it to be a very very blended look
and blend it like all over the eyes so I
thought this brush would make me be the
best thing for it I don't know we'll see
let's hop into it let's see what happens
so pick up some of that orange I'm going
to tap it off because like I said it's
my first time using this palette I don't
really know what to expect
there and then okay so i think i'm going
to start in the crease and then go up
and down because i'm just too nervous
well if you guys see like things on my
lips i use a lot of liquid lipsticks
like almost every single day so I'm
constantly either having like chapstick
on or what I have on right now is the
Opie tchas it's a sugar scrub from
perfectly posh I mentioned this I think
in my last favourites video but I have
this on as like prep for my lips I
always do that so just in case you see
any like granules on my lips it's a
sugar scrub ok so I'm going to start in
the grease and then like I said I'm
going to take it all the way up more
towards like the center of my eyebrow ok
and just push this product all around
this is going to be the only I shadow
color that i have in my ass so can
really play around with it
we need to zoom you guys on hold on a
little butter hopefully okay so I'm just
blending I'm blending in the crease and
blending it down all over my lid coming
right underneath my eyebrow bringing it
all the way up so lots and lots of
orange I mentioned this on my snapchat
just like how nervous I am to do this
look because I've never done anything
artistically creative like this and like
not knowing how it's going to turn out
and filming is like scaring the pants
off on me but we all know you push out
of our comfort zone sometime right great
okay so i think i got it to where i
wanted so i'm just gonna leave it alone
for right now I'm I do this to the next
I and then we'll move on I'm already
feeling like super mod oh my god this is
so crazy the next thing I'm going to do
is take the NYC liquid eyeliner it looks
like this and I'm going to make a wing
and what I'm gonna try to do here is
create a pretty ferocious looking wing
like I want a really large and in charge
bold hi I'm going to fly away type of
wing so we'll see it's kind of fun I
feel like it's going to be fun to make
this wing knowing that I can just make
it super big and it will all be ok
because usually you know you're trying
not to like get out of control and
that's when the eyeliner senses your
fear but hopefully it won't sense my
fear right now but I'm also going to try
to do this on camera holding a mirror
I'm really really bad at this but I'm
going to try really really hard so I'm
just gonna start like usual I'm gonna
start from the bottom of my I draw the
wing out and use a lighter pressure when
I get to the end to make a little flick
I'm going to come about pretty close to
the tip light to the flick that I made
and I'm going to bring it back across my
eye
like that and then I'm just going to
fill this in honestly I think this is
like not it was not what I was going for
it went super thick here on the end and
I just want it like a really long
straight line but I think I can still do
something with this maybe that is a very
very intense some sort of wing I don't
know what you would call this I'm going
to do the other wing off camera because
maybe I'll be slightly easier even
though like now I need to try to match
these up but I do the other wing and
then reformulate what exactly it is that
I'm doing okay guys so I wasn't really
appreciating where the wings were going
I didn't like it at all I wanted to do
the other eye and I did most of it and I
was like this is not working out so I
just wiped the wings off with some
makeup remover I kept like the line
across my eye and I kept my shadows and
everything I just kind of wiped around
the eye cleans it up with some concealer
and then started again I just can't do
eyeliner on camera I can't do eyeliner
with one hand because I'm trying to hold
a mirror and I'm trying to do it at the
same time and I have to have two hands
in there like I just I can't do eyeliner
with one hand I'm sorry I will continue
to work on it I've been asked to do my
eyeliner an eyelash routine so many
times but I I can't do that one-handed I
simply can't so until I get a better
setup and can actually have a mirror to
look into that I don't have to hold I
just can't do those kind of things i
also have take my earrings out because
there they were long and their hoops and
they were hurting my ears so i'll put
them in later but for now i can't have a
mint there were in my ears and I think
that's everything that I have to say so
I like the way these new wings came out
this one I especially like this one's
kind of like her but we're gonna keep
moving over to put lashes on and a lot
of times after I do lashes I clean up
eyeliner anyways so it's all good ok so
now I was going to resort to get even
more crazier than just putting orange
eyeshadow all the way up to my eyebrow
I'm going to take maybe this is from
colour-pop it is one of their cream gel
liners as
love these liners I think they're five
dollars i highly highly recommend i own
like five or six of these liners I love
them all I want more all of them end me
the whole collection please the gel
liners and the platform no good no boy
no stay away from them no no but maybe
is this beautiful green color and I use
this in my color pop of what did I call
it color pop of green makeup spring
makeup tutorial I don't know I used it
in there okay so what I'm gonna do okay
I like my mare what my thought plan is
is I want to make little dots under the
wing here and up and then do it on the
other side of the wing as well so like
da da da I don't know we'll see let's
see how it goes let's just try it let's
just just do some fun now you how good
if at all these are showing up on camera
so I was hoping I could just doubt it on
here but that's not really working so
I'm having to like hold and drag yeah
that's not very bright so can you guys
see the dots they're like I wish this
was being more vibrant and I think I'm
just going to go straight to the other I
I was gonna do the inner part with but
like how much this is not showing up we
don't think I want to attempt that
because I'm having to drag and I don't
want to drag the shadow alright so I'm
going to leave that alone for a hats
again move on so I'm going to work on my
lower lash line for a second this is the
Maybelline master precise Jenny skinny
gel pencil and brown I've been using
this like all the time I think it's
awesome so I'm just going to put that on
my waterline and kind of smudge it on to
the lower lash line
I'm going to pick up my e36 from morphe
and i'm going to come back into the
little i'm going to come back into the
orange shade and put that on my lower
lashline and I really I don't feel the
urge to have my lower lashline be two to
define too crazy to orange or anything
like that I just don't want it to be
bare so it's gonna smudge along and the
brown helps because I also don't want
that Warren should be too intense under
there so having the orange mixed in with
the brown kind of helps make sure that
doesn't happen
then I'm going to put my lashes on off
camera obviously i'm just going to use
the r del double ups they are probably
the most dramatic lashes that i have and
i do want really dramatic full fluffy
lashes and i think you get these with
the r del double ups I've worn them a
couple times in the past and I
absolutely love the drama that they give
a look and there are Dell Darfur boy you
can find about the drugstore so I'm
going to go pop on the double ups okay
guys got my lashes on I think they're
looking pretty fierce and what I'm going
to do next I'm going to try to keep
going with the festival vibe we're not
done yet the green dots are not it but
can you guys see the green dub snow a
little bit maybe but now I'm going to
come in with my NYX jumbo pencil and it
is in milk which is just a white shade
but now i'm going to do some dots above
my eyebrow and we'll see how this goes
this is originally like what my luck was
going to be I was just going to do like
a neutral brown shadow a long wing and
then do the dots above my eyebrows and
then I saw that like everyone was doing
that and I was like okay try to do
something more and then I got the morphe
palette and I saw the orange and I was
like that's cool and then I saw more
people were going with the dots so I was
like okay clearly that's a theme so then
I thought of the green but I'm like I
still want to do the white dots above my
eyebrows because I thought that was such
a cool look and I just like screamed
festival to me I'm go to festivals so
I've no idea how I have any sort of
screaming at me but you know so what I'm
going to do is just place the white dots
above here and I think i'm going to make
them smaller and then have them go
bigger and smaller have them go bigger
sound good okay let's just let's just
jump in so i'm going to start like
towards the end of my eyebrow
ok so there's the one I just gonna do
the other eye real quick and then decide
what the heck I'm doing in the middle
Valley make sure they're even one two
three four five six
how's that likes to look fun you guys I
feel like that's like fun I was gonna do
like maybe something big in the center
but then I saw that Matt Miller did that
and I was like okay I'm really I'm like
I'm trying not to copy everybody and I'm
afraid if I do sir if I try to do
something cool like I'll mess it up but
I don't I think that looks fun right do
you guys think that looks fun I think
this is like the hippie boho vibe and
this just got me really excited like
most of this tutorial i found like oh my
gosh I don't know if I'm doing this
right I feel like I'm screwing
everything up I'm gonna get something
thumbs down but then I did these and I
feel like like back in the groove again
I'm feeling good again okay now i think
i'm actually i want to take the green
maybe a little bit more like almost up
and connect it with the white okay so
we're actually not going to do that
because um I can't find the green pencil
it's gone so what that happened but i
think i am going to like make a few more
dots here and like almost connect him up
so just a little bit this that and that
okay so nothing crazy but I feel like I
feel like I like this even more oh I do
I like this even more you guys oh man oh
man I can't even tell you how excited I
am yay okay so let's finish the face i'm
going to highlight and do flips and then
decide if there's anything else I need
to do with my eyes and then we are done
with like the Pope of the most awkward
tutorial have ever done besides my first
makeup tutorial I can't remember what it
was but I just imagine in the super
awkward okay so while i was covering my
highlighters I found my green pencil and
this next to my computer obviously so I
did connect the green and the white so
they just kind of like flow together I
did have to add one more dot on this
side so they're not totally so much cool
but whatever so I do want to do a pretty
strong highlight a so what I want to do
the strong highlight I first come in
with what's up and this is from benefit
this is a cream highlight I have just a
little sample form because it came in a
box the full size is much different
looking
this like packaging wise so I'm just
going to put some of that on my fingers
and then put that on to my cheekbones
I'm going to bring it like up towards
the temple to and down towards the
middle of my cheek like so do the same
thing on the other side
and then next I'm going to take what's
been in my hand this whole time this is
mary lou manizer from the bomb i'm going
to take an elf this is the flawless
concealer brush and i am just going to
put that right over the wats up and
again we're doing a stronger highlight
then normal and it's been really fun to
see the different festival looks and the
different things that people are coming
up for them like some people are going
and tents on the eyes some people are
going like crazy intense on the
highlight like I have seen some really
pretty cool highlights going on um my
focus obviously was on the eyes and
doing some fun designs up there but I do
want to have a strong highlight and
that's what I am going with that is the
highlight hopefully you can see that I
think you can I did look in the mirror
when I was scrubbing my highlighters and
I think I'm pretty much done with the
eyes I feel like I did everything I
could do you know actually I might put
just a little bit more orange on the
bottom but i don't think i'm going to do
any sort of like inner corner highlight
just because the chi chi l'ha is so
intense but i'll add a little bit of
orange and then I'll come back and
finish off with the lips and then we had
done so for lips I'm going to come in
with this NYX soft matte lip cream and
this is in Rome and I picked this one
it's like a burgundy type shade and I
picked it because I didn't want to go
pink I didn't want to go orange I had a
4-inch lipstick at first that I thought
I was going to do I didn't want to go
nude I didn't want to go red and so I
want it like some sort of off color in
between color and I think this one might
be it so let's just let's just see
this will work I wanted something like
complimentary that wasn't going to
overwhelm or take away from the eyes but
I also didn't on it to be too like I
didn't want to nude all right guys and
there we have it the completed look we
did it oh I didn't want to mention I did
leave my lower lashes free from mascara
that is intentional on sometimes I won't
do anything with my lower lashes if I am
like being intense up top so especially
with the double up a lot of times I
won't put mascara on the lower lashes so
that is intentional i wanted to mention
that but now we are done yay we did it
that is it for this a festival inspired
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video like I said it is
just it was so much fun for me to make
and did do something different I hope to
be able to push myself more on my
channel and step outside of my comfort
zone more and just do more fun and
creative things because I really did
have so much been so much fun filming
this and even though things kind of like
we're going wrong and in different
directions while filming like I didn't
give up I swear I thought I was going to
give up I'm i filmed this video like two
weeks in advance or something like I
filmed it so far in advance just because
I was like in case things go wrong and
screw up like I'm just gonna know I'm
just going to stop and I'll start over
another day and I didn't do that I'm
really proud of myself for that because
this was definitely something different
I'm not a makeup artist I'm not a
professional I'm just a girl who really
really enjoys beauty and decided to hop
on YouTube and explore a different
passion of mine that is so different
from my everyday life in my everyday
career as an author so this was a lot of
fun again thank you to Leslie for asking
