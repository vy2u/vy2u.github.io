previous video on the bookish favorites
for August you will know that I have
been really sick lately but I got video
up for our favorites but then I really
wanted to come on here because we have
exciting news to share today and that is
marching ink the publishing company that
I own has put out another book it is
called first and goal and it is by Laura
Chapman and I don't have any print copy
yet to show you but this is what the
cover looks like can you guys see that
can you see the cover I sure hope you
can see us sometimes there's like a
weird glare here in my office but even
though I still don't feel good and I
still sound crazy and I probably still
look kooky I really wanted to come on
here to share this news with you guys
because we were just so excited to have
another book out there think goal is
Kristen goal is Laura's third
full-length novel that she has out there
she also has hard hats and doormats and
the marrying type and then first and
goal I'm so excited for this book
because I'm such a huge football fan and
if you can't guess from the title or by
the cover the story does revolve around
football but it's not like just for
football fans like you don't need to be
a football fan to read this it will
probably just give you a little
something extra if you are basically
just to give a quick rundown of what the
book is about Harper is our main
character and she is starting at a new
job she basically gets told that like
she's not fitting in well enough at her
job so she decides to join the works
fantasy football team so if you're not
familiar with fantasy football a fun
part of the book and why I say you don't
need to be a football fan is because in
the book the Harper is you know a
football phien in knows football she's
not familiar with fantasy football
doesn't know how to play it so it's kind
of like she's teaching you along the way
so if you know nothing about it you know
neither does she in the book and she's
learning and being explained to her so
you kind of are as well so I don't feel
like readers would be super confused
like what's going on and I don't
understand what's happening and
all that sort of thing but then of
course when she joins the league there's
a romance interest involved there's
issues from her past that are coming up
with an ex-boyfriend that she left
behind there was a great cast of
secondary characters that are involved
in the romance that are involved in the
drama she's got two really fun brothers
that are along for the ride and it's
just such a fun book we are putting it
out this week because the NFL kicks off
this week I'm so excited I'm a huge
Green Bay Fan I know I've mentioned that
a few times on this channel but go pack
go laura is a Green Bay Fan as well so
like we get along really well I mean
we've never met in person but we get
along really well over the phone and
online especially when we're cheering
for the packers they found week laura

planned online I will leave of course
