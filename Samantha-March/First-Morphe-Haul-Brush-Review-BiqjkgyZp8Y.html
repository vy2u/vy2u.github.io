channel today's video I'm going to be
doing a murphy hall I recently put in my
very first order with morphe brushes I
was very excited to get it so I'm going
to share what I got and so I got one eye
shadow palette and then I got four of
their brushes and I'm in this video I'm
going to go in depth into the brushes
and kind of give my review and feedback
and then in a separate video I'm going
to do a full breakdown of the palette
that I got do swatches of all the 35
shades and do a makeup tutorial out of
there so this one is just like the
general hall but then also the in-depth
brush review I do also want to say I'm
filming this the day after Halloween it
is November first as I filmed this video
we did have a halloween party last night
so my voice is a little not quite up to
snuff because we stayed up so late but
I'm just pretty tired today and since
today's November first NaNoWriMo has
kicked off I mentioned in one of my past
videos that i was taking the National
Novel Writing Month challenge which is
where you challenge yourself to write
50,000 words in the month of november i
am taking on the challenge so i have
been writing a lot this morning right
now I'm 4,000 words in which my goal for
the day was two thousand words so I have
doubled that so taking a break gonna
film this video I did a real quick
makeup job and just disguised it by
putting on really bright lipstick so I
would look more awake maybe it worked
but anyways if you would like to see
what i got from morphe and police
gabbana i'm just going to mention the
palette real quickly so i got the 35 t
palette this is what the packaging looks
like and it does say the 35 t here on
the back so it is their taupe does the
35 taupe is what the T stands for so
inside has the plastic cover and then
these are what the shades look like
so hopefully you can see that ok I do
have some swatches on my Instagram page
March books beauty if you want to check
that out there some better swatches on
there for you again like i said i will
do a whole video that will have all of
the swatches on here and in depth review
on what i think of these and also a
makeup tutorial so that is the 35 t this
was 2299 on the morphe website and they
have a lot of different palettes the 350
is a really popular palette and what
else if I haven't seen the 35 k I've
been seeing a lot of it as well I
believe the 350 is still sold out its I
think it said on the website this
morning that it's being restocked soon
but that one is just like in high demand
but I really loved the taupe shades the
like the purples and the plums and
things like that I really liked it in
this palette so look for my full review
video to becoming on this person ahead
and get into the four brushes that I
bought I do want to say I guess I should
maybe mention just kind of my whole
experience with ordering from morphe
since this is the first time that I've
ever ordered from them I basically well
I heard about morphe because so many
youtubers use it you know we see it on
Instagram p'ing popped up all the time
but basically the good thing about
morphy is that they are an affordable
line so when I go through the brushes I
can talk about how much each word but
like you know the eyeshadow palettes for
$23 435 shades they do have individual I
shadows they have you know they're
really known for their brushes but they
have a lot on their they sell like
different lines and such on their
website as well so there's a lot that
you can get on their website which is
good I believe they do have a few like
physical stores i think in the
california area but mostly they are
based on line so you know i heard about
it through YouTube through Instagram and
it was mostly because of the craze over
the 350 palette like just people were
going so crazy over it and so at that
time jaclyn hill had a fifteen percent
off code for more feet one two three
five
came back in stock and it wasn't just
for that palette you could just use her
code to get fifteen percent off
everything and the highest that Murphy
had gone for like discount codes had
been ten percent so when I saw fifteen
percent I was like well you know this is
probably a good time to put an order in
try out a new company see how I like
them so that's what I did kind of why I
ordered I had a pretty good experience
with everything I thought the website
was really easy to navigate it was easy
to check out etc the only part that was
not so great was how long it took me to
get my order i placed it on october
third and i think i've got it october
23rd i think is what it was so it took a
considerable amount of time to get here
and it was when i place the order it did
say you know we're having like high
demand so orders might take you know
like seven days seven to ten days to
ship out or something like that and i
think my order shipped out after like 14
days and then it took another week to
get to me so i was a little frustrated
with that but I do follow them on
Instagram and they had a really nice
post on there just saying you know how
busy there been and they're working
overtime they're trying to get
everyone's orders shipped as fast as
they can so I do understand that I you
know they are a smaller company and they
are all of a sudden very much in demand
so they're trying to keep up with
everything and you know everything and
my order was correct which sometimes I
mean I've ordered from companies and
they've sent me the wrong brush they
sent me that the wrong eye shadow color
they sent me the wrong like piece of
jewelry so you know when I got
everything everything was correcting in
my order and I was happy with that it
just it did take a while to get to me I
I don't think that they will always be
that way like will this experience make
me not order from them in the future no
because i think i will reorder from them
i will probably just keep in mind you
know sometimes you order something and
you know that you need it in a specific
amount of time like maybe i won't do
that with more food just in case but i
also don't think they will always be
that backed up that make sense other
than that my my experience ordering from
them was pretty good
overall just it just took a while to get
to me but I just wanted to throw that
out there as well and to jump into the
brushes the first one that I got is a
foundation brush and this is the m4 39
so that is what that one looks like and
this is one that Jaclyn hill uses a lot
and really recommends and I believe it
said it was also like the morphe creator
I believe her name is Linda that this is
like one of her favorites like one of
her staples and I only have one
foundation brush I have the Sigma f80
kabuki which I can show you to do a
comparison that's really my only
foundation brush and it gets a little
frustrating when you feel like you
constantly have to keep cleaning it so I
really want it to get another one just
to have a second foundation brush in my
collection with new to make up and you
know obviously I'm new to youtube but
like wearing more makeup everyday so
this is my second foundation brush in
here but so far i really like it let me
grab the sigma brush to show you so my
sigma brush is pretty dirty but this is
the Sigma f80 kabuki brush so this is
the foundation brush that I've had for
probably a year now for foundation and I
really like it it's I mean you hear a
lot of people talk about this brush it's
really great and so here they are side
by side so you can see obviously this
one has the flat top this is the Round
Top but even these the f80 the bristles
and just the brush in general is it's
like very firm very like stiff and firm
whereas with the m4 39 I mean it's more
rounded but it's just it's it's soft and
I honestly kind of wondered when I took
it out and I was kind of playing with it
and I do I did the whole like on hauling
on my snapchat if you guys do follow me
on snapchat I do any like unboxings on
the snapchat as well before I get them
on YouTube but I was playing with it and
I was saying it was soft but at the same
time I was like how does how is this
gonna work because I just kind of
thought I would put the foundation on it
and I to me just the way it feels I
thought the foundation would basically
seep into the bristles and not transfer
very well onto my face since
I'm so used to like how this is firm I
just I don't know I felt like it would
transfer better with this one but
honestly I haven't seen a difference I
mean truly I have not come across any
issues i have been using this one solely
for since i got the order so for about
two weeks this is the only foundation
brush I've been using because I've been
testing it out I wanted to talk about it
and I really like it I truly don't
really see a difference between these
two this one is much softer on my face
like I feel like I could just smooth the
foundation all over but I feel like it
puts the product on there well it it
moves it around well it doesn't just
seep into the brush like you don't I
don't have to use any more product with
this one because that's kind of what my
thought was like I'm gonna have to use
more foundation because I'm going to
lose the foundation in the brush that
wasn't the case so I'm very very happy
with this my first impression maybe was
a little like a I don't know but since
I've been using it I really do like it
and to give you guys the cost comparison
this one was 1399 and then the f80 Sigma
is twenty-four dollars so basically half
off I was pretty angry with that and the
next one's out I got is the g2 and it's
their appointed buffer brush I think
this was from the gun metal collection
as well and this is to a buff out your
concealer under your eye and this one is
I got it from Amanda and sing i believe
is her name another youtuber here she
always uses this brush I think she just
did like her favorite brushes and this
one was included in there I didn't
concealer a lot more now that i have
started to understand the purposes of it
and what it can help me do i do suffer
with dark circles under my eyes so I
have been if you just watch my latest
makeup tutorial like before I go in with
my eyeshadows i'm using concealer as my
primer basically but I'm putting the
concealer all around down here on my
eyelids like on the inner part of my
eyes up here even and so I've been
really putting my Beauty Blender to the
test and also I have a concealer brush
from Sephora that I've been using a lot
so again it was basically just like I
want something else in my collection so
i don't have to constantly be cleaning
these things because i'm using you
have this technique so often so that's
why I decided to go with the g-tube
brush now first impressions I pulled it
out and it's very light to me it and it
almost like i don't know i didn't i
didn't love how it felt in my hands like
it just felt light and to me light felt
cheap and I was like am I gonna like
this I don't understand I don't know I
love it I love it so it's so funny
because I feel like my first impressions
on a lot of these morphe brushes i was
kind of like don't know about that and
then i started to use them and I'm like
okay I get it I get it and I like it and
so don't let the first impressions scare
you it basically is what I've learned
but i am using this so much it's so easy
to just push buff it out under your
under-eye bring it all the way up even
on the on my eyelids it's so soft again
like it is so soft it has a bit of this
like pointed tip to it and makes it easy
to get right under there easy even when
I want to like sharpen up my wing under
there usually I would use like the very
light pointed edge of my beauty blender
to do that but I can even do it with
this it's so easy to do I'm really
really happy with this one um the
Sephora brush that I'm talking about is
the number 57 it's their pro concealer
brush so obviously I mean big difference
in what the brushes look like but they
are both concealer brushes if you watch
my makeup tutorials this is what I'm
often using if I'm not using a Beauty
Blender i'm using this little brush and
I do so like it and I still use it again
this one seems more firm where the
morphe one is softer I really do have
like the same use to me and to give a
price comparison the Sephora one is
twenty-four dollars again the morphe g2
is 1399 so again half off i have two
more brushes i also ordered a blush
brush and this is the m42 seven it is
the duo blush brush blush brush and why
I specifically wanted a this blush brush
it's because I wanted the
the synthetic bristles right here right
here right here you know where the
bristles are I want that because NT
madly fallen in love with colour-pop
cosmetics and their blushes are a very
different consistency and almost kind of
like a gel mousse like type of
consistency and using a regular blush
brush for those just doesn't really work
out well and even color pop says like
the duo blush brushes the synthetic
fibers they work a lot better for their
products so I really wanted to get one
and again this is one that I see a lot
of other youtubers use and so I thought
okay I'll go with this one again I got
it and I don't know it just like even
the bristles just didn't really feel
like what maybe I had imagined they
would be I don't know just kind of like
ah don't know if this is going to be
great it's great I mean you can see I've
been using it I've been testing it out
I've used it slowly on my color pop
blushes because that's really what i got
it for I have you know three regular
blush brushes that i can use with other
things so i really wanted to use those
for color pop and it works incredible
and i find i had a like very small
synthetic brush that i was using for
color pop it really is more like a like
a foundation brush almost but very small
what what brush is that I think it's
from ELF I can't remember exactly but I
was having to go back in a lot into the
blush and put more blush on this I just
do one swipe like once swish with my
color pop blushes and boom put it on and
there we go that's all I need I really
really love this brush and the price of
it is only 999 so yes that is the m42
seven duo blush brush then the last one
I got is the g13 this is from the
gunmetal collection as well I believe
and it is called a blending fluff so
basically just a blending brush they
have a lot of different blending brushes
on there and it honestly I think I was
just like so overwhelmed by all the
choices I
to solve this one and it was by the g2
and I was like okay I'll get this one
because there's just so many to choose
from of blending brushes and like wood
but this is the one I got again it feels
very light almost like the most like the
g2 like it just like feels super light
and it's kind of short and I don't know
just my first impressions again I like
aha I don't know we'll see how it works
and this one I would compare it to the
Sigma blending brush the e25 that's what
the Sigma one looks like so kind of
together that's what they look right
look like there and then if you can see
like the Sigma one is you know a little
bit longer so probably why when I pulled
this one out I'm like why is it so short
but it does I mean it does its job it's
a blending brush I don't feel like I see
a huge difference between these but i
honestly i will say i think i do like
the sigma one a little bit better it's a
little bit maybe denser i think like
feeling the brushes i think this one is
a little bit denser and it just helps me
blend out just like a smidgen smidgen
smidgen easier this one is fourteen
dollars from Sigma this one is 799 from
morphe so I mean if you just want to
save a little bit of money I definitely
think the g13 will do the job I just
happen to like the Sigma one just a
little bit better but again they're just
they're blending brushes they do
basically the same job I really do like
them both so yeah that was the g13 the
blanks that was all my purchases that i
got from morphe and my in-depth review
on the brushes oh I should also point
out my fingernails if you phony ones
like wondering what my nails are about
it because we had our halloween party
last night um me and my group of
girlfriends we went as social media we
were all a different app basically and I
was YouTube so my colors were red and
white I had like a red and white tutu
that I made my shirt had the YouTube
symbol ironed on there if you go to my
Instagram page i posted a picture of
what my costume looked like it was a lot
of fun but i painted my nails red and
white I ran out of time
I actually wanted to do like the white
play button on each night each of my
fingernails but like one on each hand I
was going to do the little play button
and then I just ran out of time
yesterday so that didn't work out so
sorry my nails are kind of weird in this
video but I used the sally hansen 3d gel
shine on these so these nails probably
aren't going to go anywhere for a while
so I didn't even want to try to take
them off today anyways that was my
morphe order i hope you guys liked it um
if you guys have any questions about any
of those specific products that i
mentioned please just comment below and
let me know i'm happy to answer them for
you if you have any questions on my
process in general from ordering from
morphe i mean again just comment below
let me know i'm happy to answer any of
those for you i would love to know if
what you guys have for morphy like is
there any more food products or even
pallets or anything like that that you
think are just like a must that we must
have because I do want to place another
order with Murphy I'm very happy with
what I received from them i'm happy with
the quality i'm happy with the price i'm
happy how it worked all that good stuff
so i definitely will be ordering from
morphe again so I'd love to know if you
guys have any products that you think
are a must to have I will be doing that
full breakdown of the 35 t pallet here
shortly so watch for that it will
include a makeup tutorial I do my eyes I
just have two eyeshadows on today and
then I'd like half-assed winged eyeliner
cuz I'm like I'm tired and don't want to
do a lot of makeup but I've been trying
to use only the more food palette for a
while here to last night my my makeup
that I did for my halloween costume I
mean it wasn't crazy but I used
everything from morphe cuz i'm trying to
use as many different shades and just so
i can give a full review here shortly so
be watching for that video everyone had
a terrific Halloween I've been having a
lot of fun going through Instagram and
looking at all the pictures of everyone

snap at all weather on my personal
snapchat or on my Samantha March
