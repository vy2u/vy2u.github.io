channel yes I am completely bare face of
makeup right now Oh Nelly but is because
today's video is going to be all about
my full coverage foundation routine and
I'm also going to be sharing how i
highlight contour baked bronze you know
all that good stuff I thought about
separating the videos like doing just
found a shin and then doing just like
highlight and contour and baking and all
that but I don't know they just all go
together for me so I didn't really want
to split the videos because it just
seemed like it would be repetitive for
what I did for foundation i would put in
the highlight contour or what i did
probably like contour would go in the
foundation so i was like i make long
videos anyways so why don't we just put
it all together and i'm just going to
show how i get a full coverage
foundation + how I do my highlight my
baking and my contouring so I'll be
going through step-by-step of how I do
all of this i'll be using some of my new
favorite products i'm like old-school
products that I just absolutely love and
yeah I'm just excited to share this
video with you it has been requested a
couple times I mean even back like a
while ago and I've always kind of just
had it lurking on my list and I'm like
no I just need to get this video filmed
because I know some of you guys have
been wanting to see it so yes how about
we happen to my foundation highlight
contour baking routine my step one is
putting my hair into a nice little top
notch like doing the top nuts on camera
cuz I'm not a huge fan of like pulling
my hair up all the way back because I'm
self conscious of my ears so the time
not really saves me when I still want
like this hair off my face so I'm not
putting product in it top that really
saves the day so enjoy that I also don't
have any like cute headbands like you
know everyone's got like the cute
headbands and like the ears and I don't
I don't have any of that stuff so
topknots gonna have to work the first
thing is that i do when i'm doing more
of either a full coverage routine or a
foundation routine that I want to like
last all day the first thing that I'm
going to do even before I prime my face
is like I like do a double prime so I
will spray my face with a like setting
spray first and the ones that I've been
loving lately is from
I owe badescu it's their facial spray
with a low herbs and rose water looks
like this I picked it up at Ulta it's
very affordable it was like seven
dollars or something and I think I got
mine on sale but it says it's a
rejuvenating a facial spray you can use
it to set makeup soothe your skin and
dehydrating conditions or give your skin
a quick boost anytime anywhere so I use
it to kind of like prime my face some
people use mac fix+ or if you have just
any other setting spray feel free to use
that but that's what I'm going to do
first and then for my primer you know
we're just being a little bit extra but
for my second primer i'm going to use
from maybelline it is their blur and
illuminate primer it looks like this it
is from their face studio line so i
think it is a little bit pricier than
like some of the other Maybelline
products but it's a really really good
drugstore higher-end option that has a
good illuminating primer is the Beca
primer the backlight priming filter this
is a really good one for a high-end
option if you're interested in that it
gives really good like luminosity and
glow to the skin but for looking for a
more affordable one I say go for
Maybelline because I think it is very
nice kind of how I do my primers is if
I'm using like a mattifying foundation
or a foundation that doesn't have any
like luminosity to it i will use more of
a mattifying or regular primer because
if i use luminous primer and luminous
foundation it's it kind of just brings
like an oily effect and doesn't look
good so that's kind of how I like to
judge what I'm doing and for the
foundation I'm using the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer and
this is more on like the matte side
finish like it's not super super matte
but it definitely does not have any like
glow to it in my opinion so that's why i
use the illuminating primer so that's
kind of how i do my how i pick my
primers is what i'm using for foundation
but i'm choosing the clinic beyond
perfecting to use because a this is like
my current obsession right now i bought
it at the sephora vib sale and I've just
fallen in love with it
ever since I can't stop using it and it
is more full coverage to me especially
when I use a brush to apply it versus a
Beauty Blender it definitely is a more
full coverage a good full coverage
foundation that I hear everyone talked
about as the estee double we're like
everyone says that's like the fullest of
full coverage foundation I don't own
that one but I have heard that a lot a
drugstore full coverage in my opinion in
my opinion is the Maybelline fit me
especially the maybelline fit me matte
and poreless I think that is super full
coverage at times it's actually almost
two full coverage for me I'm not huge
into that like every single day to have
a thing but when I know I need full
coverage I will typically reach for the
Maybelline matte and poreless so those
are a few other options for you but for
today I'm picking my current favorite
the clinic I am in the shade 6.5
buttermilk as a pretty fun applicator it
looks like this and i just use it and
kind of put a few stripes on my face
like so
so looking good right now then to buff
that in I'm going to use my Sigma flat
kabuki brush this is the f80 from Sigma
one of my favorite foundation brushes
another affordable foundation brush that
I really love is the morphe m 439 both
of these brushes were mentioned in my
top 10 brushes video so if you haven't
seen that I would check that out or both
in there and then I'm just going to buff
this into the skin again like I
mentioned and I think I mentioned this
in when I did the first impression of
this foundation is if you don't want it
to be as full coverage and you want just
a little bit of a lighter finish I would
use a damp Beauty Blender to buff it in
and I recommend that tip with any
foundation I really do love the
maybelline fit me matte and poreless but
some days like I said it's just a little
bit like too much for me and when I
still want to wear it but I don't want
such a full coverage I just use a Beauty
Blender because of all of the hydration
that you're getting from a damp Beauty
Blender it just kind of helps cheer
things out a little bit so that is just
a little tip from me so I'm just going
to blend this in then I am having a few
areas of redness like on my chin in here
under my cheek and so part of this
clinic foundation is that it's a two and
one and you're supposed to be able to
spot correct any spots and like use this
as a concealer I'm just going to place a
little bit on my chin a little bit on my
under eye that's a long need and then
I'll just bust those in with my brush we
go in and set the foundation and for
this I'm going to use the Maybelline
master fix loose setting powder and I'm
going to use my morphe III brush to
apply it this brush was also mentioned
in my top 10 brushes video if you have
not seen that one so I'm just going to
swirl it in the powder and apply lightly
to my face it just going to help keep
the foundation in place all day I really
love this powder I mentioned it in my
recent fab or fail from the drugstore
and this definitely got a big ol fab
from me
it is a great powder for concealer I'm
going to use the Maybelline better skin
and for the concealer I'm going to place
this under my eyes I like to make the
the triangle under here and bring it out
and up and I also like to bring the
concealer on to the sides of my nose
it's kind of just a trick to make your
nose look smaller
then I also put concealer in the center
of my forehead down the bridge of my
nose on my Cupid's bow and on my chin so
for concealing it's kind of like a
two-in-one because you're doing it not
only to conceal like any you know dark
circles under your under eyes but you're
also using it to highlight your face and
if you're using it to highlight your
face and you go like like this is
intense concealer under here like if I
just I'm trying to mask dark circles you
know I'll just put a little bit under
there and buff it out no big deal but if
you're using it to also highlight your
face if you do under your under-eyes you
also want to make sure you're balancing
that out by doing the forehead the nose
keep its Boeing chin because and you
want to have your concealer and your
highlighting points be more like on the
inner part of your face and then you
contour around the edges of your face so
now that I have all the areas that I
want to conceal / highlights I'm going
to use my more Fuji to another favorite
favorite brush I'm just going to go
ahead and start to blend that in I
usually bring my concealer on my eyelids
as well and I have it act as an eye
primer
and then to bake our my undereyes i'm
going to use the laura mercier it's the
secret brightening powder so what I do
is I just take this as the Real
Techniques Beauty sponge and I just grab
a generous amount of product and apply
this to the under-eye where I placed
concealer I don't bake all of the time
because I think it's kind of time
consuming so sometimes I'll just use a
regular translucent powder but if I'm
going for like the full face effect like
long lasting type of we're really
getting into it this is what I will use
laura mercier secret brightening powder
and then I'm just going to let it sit
there for about five minutes and you're
just letting the powder kind of like
seep into your skin basically you're
using with the warmth from your own body
to help set the concealer and set the
powder so i'll leave it set for about
five minutes and then dusted away then
i'm going to contour as we are baking
and i do not have any sort of like cream
contouring sets but i will show you how
I cream contour in my own way this is
how I've been doing it for probably
about a year now and I was picked up
from Jaclyn hill when she did like cream
contouring a while back I went out and
bought what she suggested and it's
basically just using a foundation that
is much darker for your skin and so i
have the l'oreal true match and it is in
n 7 so it looks like this and i just use
my sephora 57 brush looks like this and
this is what i use to cream contour to
me it's a lot more affordable especially
it for going out and buying like
contouring kits where you only use one
or two out of the six to eight colors
that are in there and I just feel like
it's a big waste so this is the way that
I do it again I picked it up from Jaclyn
hill I didn't make this up myself but
it's what I've been doing for about a
year when I want to cream contour and
works just fine for me I just pour a
little bit into the cap of it and then
dip my brush in
they're so when you are contouring the
cheekbones basically I start from the
top of my ear and go down so I'm just
going to place little dots there and
then do the same thing on the other side
like start towards my ear and calm down
and then I'm also going to place them on
my forehead real close to my hairline
and then a little bit underneath my chin
and jaw then I will do just a little
swipe on the sides of my nose and on the
tip of my nose I'm not someone who like
really dislikes their know so I don't do
a whole lot here but just a little bit
like that looking nice and crazy now so
basically when your contouring you're
trying to give yourself a shadow so it
looks like your your cheekbones pop a
little bit more you can slim your face
and so depending on you your face what
it is that you're looking for I mean you
can contour in different ways but this
is what I prefer to do for myself if you
have a larger forehead you can contour
the sides of your forehead more to give
the effect of a smaller forehead I mean
people can contour their nose to
literally make it look like they've had
a nose job I mean it's really really
cool what you can do with makeup and I'm
just going to take that Real Techniques
Beauty sponge and I'm just going to
blend in the contour for blending out
the contour I suggest again having a
damp Beauty Blender it just just makes
things easier so again just when you
think of contouring you're thinking of
making shadows on your face and kind of
slimming areas that's kind of like how I
think of it and then when you think of
highlighting you're thinking about
brightening areas of the face and really
illuminating okay so we are all lend it
out now I'm just going to dust away that
powder are going to come back and use
the more feet III for this it's just a
really light brush and just kind of dust
that excess away then a lot of people
like to like clean up the contour you've
made and I like to do this again it's
not something that I do every day but
when I'm going for you know more of an
instep look I will do this because I do
like the effect that it gives so
basically we're going to put powder like
right down here and it really does kind
of help like sharpen up the contour so
you can like see a definitive line but
without looking like to like you know
I'm saying like I'll show we'll do it
together so we can see what we're all
talking about but basically I'm just
going to come back with the Maybelline
loose powder is my Real Techniques
makeup sponge again I'm just going to
dip it into that and then I'm just going
to apply that underneath the contour
again just come underneath the Condor
some people like to bake their smile
lines right up in here like kind of like
trying to give yourself a weird look at
mustache I mean that's fine you can do
whatever you want okay so we got like
our fun mustache on i'ma leave it that's
it for a few minutes as well and then to
kind of bronze up my face I'm going to
use the too faced chocolate soleil
bronzer and the morphe m530 use this to
bronze sense as we bake so I like to
think about bronzing like around the
temples and again like going pretty far
back like towards your hairline
for bronzer you do want to have a pretty
light hand and a lot of times your
bronzer can actually be used to kind of
like set the cream contour as well so
this too faced chocolate soleil bronzer
is definitely a big big favorite of mine
I've had it for a very long time and I'm
just going to apply blush real quick I'm
going to use the Milani Luminoso a total
favorite plus the morphe em 427 this is
just a nice duo fiber brush Luminoso is
such like an all-time favorite blush but
especially for like spring summer
because it's just so like PG but bronzy
glowy it's just a beautiful blush
definitely a recommendation right and
then I'm just going to dust away the
extra powder under here and you can see
it just kind of gives a sharper a line
of where your contour is so in case like
in case you went a little crazy with the
contour and brought it down here and
that's obviously going to defeat the
purpose of why your contouring so if you
dust it away and then just have that
nice sharp little line there I really
like the way that that looks and so now
my face isn't mostly done I'm going to
just do like a really simple I look off
camera and then come back and do my
highlight so I just did like really
really simple eyes like they don't even
have false lashes on when I shout out
just a quick eye liner job and a bunch
of toothpaste better than sex mascara so
that's all I'm going to do for the eyes
today just because I'm really just
trying to show you my face routine but
to finish it all up I'm going to
highlight which is one of my favorite
parts i'm going to use another current
obsession of mine which is the Anastasia
glow kit and this is in that glow so
this is what the inside looks like my
favorite brush to highlight at the
moment is the more p.m. a 501 brush this
was also mentioned in my top 10 brushes
the shade that I'm going to use today to
highlight
is bubbly I really I go back and forth
between bubbly and dripping in gold I
just I love them both but i'm just going
to use bubbly and then to highlight I
just do the tops of my cheekbones right
here and then bring it slowly into the
center of my cheek and this will really
just illuminate the tops of the
cheekbones and give the skin a glowy
finish I usually like to take the very
very tip of the brush and pop it right
into the center of my cheek like that
and then dust it out because I got
something about having that glow like
right and like the apple of your cheeks
just it makes me so happy so that's how
I do that and then if you really want to
get like intense glowy look I just
continue to take the highlight up and
kind of make a see motion so bring it up
onto the temple and then above my
eyebrow as well and this will just
really give you like a highlighted
luminous effect I'm going to repeat
these steps on the other side if you
guys have any other video suggestions
from me that you would like to see
please do leave those in the comments
below I've been getting so many requests
to do an eyelash video and I promise it
is coming I've just been kind of trying
to figure out how to film it since I
don't have like I'm not hands-free like
I'm holding a mirror I always have to
hold it me or I actually don't have like
a table or anything in front of me so I
just always have to have a mirror in my
hand and I usually need two hands to
apply the lashes so I've been just
trying to like figure it out and I've
been working on practicing and I promise
I will have that one coming very soon
but and so also other areas that I like
to highlight is just down the bridge of
my nose again these are areas that we
put the concealer these are areas that
we want to highlight
and I just take a little bit and i do
right on the tip of my nose I saw a
bunch of people start to do this a while
back and I was like I like the way that
that looks too I mean all of this is
whatever your preference is you know and
they'll do on my Cupid's bow as well
some people actually like get very
precise and they actually highlight like
the lines of the cupid bow Cupid's bow I
just kind of dust a little powder on
there because again this is a hundred
percent our preference that's our makeup
it's our face that's what we want to do
this is just how I do it ok so those are
the areas that I highlight and yeah that
is basically my full coverage foundation
my baking contouring and highlight
routine again these are this is just
like what I do of course you know modify
it for yourself but I'm just going to
finish up real quick and add some lip
color take my hair down and then we
aren't and before I forget to migrate
last step it has what my very first step
was and that is setting the entire face
once again I'm gonna use my Mario
Badescu setting spray and just spritz
away and there we have it so that is my
full coverage foundation routine
including how I do my highlight
contouring and baking I really hope that
you guys enjoyed this video I hope you
found it helpful thank you guys so much
for requesting to see this video its it
just makes me happy when you guys
request things and it gives me better
ideas on producing videos that you guys
want to see you so of course if you have
any other recommendations please do
leave those in the comments below i do
want to point out that i'm still very
much a beginner when it comes to makeup
I got on youtube about one year ago and
really started learning about makeup and
applying it and brushes and techniques
this to me definitely is more of a like
beginner type of version for foundation
and highlight contouring baking I know
like I probably not going as in-depth as
some other ones but I just do want to
throw it out there that I am still very
much a beginner so I mean hopefully this
helps other people who are beginners
that are trying to learn to and can get
kind of confused by some other people
because I know
I certainly can and when I'm trying to
learn different techniques I really do
like watching people who are you know
trained to make up artists or have been
doing this for years and you know really
have a technique down but then I also
like to watch some of the other people
who I know our beginners as well and see
what they're doing because a lot of
times it's it reflects more on me and
what I'm doing so I know I kind of held
off on doing this video for a while
because I'm like I don't know if I'm
gonna be good enough you know what I'm
saying like I don't know if this is good
enough to put out there but then I
realized that I like to watch these
types of videos and watch beginners
because I can just relate to them more
and I feel like that's what I feel like
with a lot of my followers and
subscribers and people that I talk to
every single day um via social media or
snapchat that's kind of like how I feel
like I'm connecting with you guys like
we're all kind of learning together and
so I really appreciate that feedback and
you know appreciate you guys like giving
me the courage to be able to make these
type of videos because it sucks when you
don't think that you're good enough at
something but when you know that you
have so many people that like are
rooting for you to do it it just it
really is a confidence booster so thank
you guys so much i can't say how much I
really really truly do appreciate that
but yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video or we're able to take away some
helpful tips or just products in general
