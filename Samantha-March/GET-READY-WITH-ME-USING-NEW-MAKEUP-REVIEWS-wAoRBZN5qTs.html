today's video is going to be a get ready
with me I'm going to be using the
majority of the products from my most
recent haul it featured items from Ulta
dose of colors and also Sigma Beauty I
will have that video linked down below
so I have been trying out these products
and I want to give my reviews on each of
them and be trying a bunch of them on so
it's kind of also going to be like a
follow up from that haul video and also
trying on some of the items so you can
see how they actually apply and the
makeup look that we come up with so if
you are ready to get ready with me why
don't we go ahead and get started that
resume day and I'm going to go ahead and
put my ears on here because I am going
to be starting a with my eyes so I just
got this from oculi this is from Urban
Decay I was so excited to see Urban
Decay on the oculi website I picked up
their eyeshadow primer potion and they
agreed to send it to me which was super
exciting this is in original and I was
excited because I had never tried the
Urban Decay primer potion I've been
testing it out for the past week or so
and I think it's pretty good I thought
it was interesting how the applicator is
it's almost like a like a regular
concealer applicator for some reason I
thought it was going to be like I was
gonna have to like squeeze tube it out
the only thing I feel like I'm not
really digging about it is that I always
have to come back in and like go back in
twice into the product which I find a
little bit annoying but if I don't then
I feel like I don't have enough it's
like it's like a not a lot of product
goes on to the actual applicator and
then use my Sigma cut crease c62
to make sure our lid is all primed and
ready for my eyes I'm going to be using
the two I products that I featured in
that video my haul video the first one
is the wildflower palette from Sigma
Beauty and I'm also going to be using
the dose of colors does the xkd the
girls eye shadow palette I am going to
come in here and I'm going to grab this
white shade right here and this is a
modem metallic brush this is their m18 I
believe it is saying so I'm just going
to dip into that color austere and I'm
going to apply that all over my eyelid
then the first
I'm going to come into is apricot flower
which is a right here and I'm using a
morphe 27 it's just a big blending brush
and I'm just going to apply this into
the crease a little bit above the crease
just being a little bit messy with this
shade so this is Sigma eyeshadow palette
I freaking adore I keep talking about it
I just gave it a shout-out on Twitter
the other day I've been talking about it
on my snapchat I am so impressed with
this palette I think it's really cool
how there's four different eyeshadows in
here and then you also have a blush and
a highlight and I love legit every
single shade out of here I've been using
this a ton and I'm just very impressed
with it I believe it is $36 on the
signal website I'll have everything that
I'm using listed and linked down below
so next I'm going to come into the shade
Edel berry and this is just a blending
brush from the morphe copper dream set
and I'm going to Pat this shade on the
outer part of my eye I enjoy the shade
because when I first looked at it I was
like that's a really overwhelming shadow
it looks so deep and dark in the pan but
once you actually put it on your eyes
and especially once you start blending
it out it is just a really beautiful
purple it's not too overwhelming if they
want there to be a nice fade on this
outer part of my eye but then also a
nice fade on the inner part as well
before we come in with the shade from
the does ekt collab so I'm just gonna
take my time blending that out until I
enjoy the fade of that really pretty
purple once I have the eyes right where
I want them I'm going to switch over to
the dose of colors it does the xkd the
girls eye shadow palette so this is what
it looks like inside it has to be four
different eyeshadows it also does have a
mirror so I I do I have some thoughts
the brush that I want to use they do
recommend to use your fingers with this
palette and I definitely do recommend to
use your fingers as well some of the
shades are fine with
but I think you get the most amount of
pay off with your fingers but I'm just
going to use the Sigma e 56 the shader
brush I actually mentioned this in my
haul as well and I freaking love this
brush like love this brush if you want a
good lid brush especially for like
foiled shadows or shadows like these
this one is really freakin good I'm
gonna spray it with a little bit of my
pure miracle mist I'm just having my
brush a little bit wet they say that
there's only two shades in here that you
do need to use with water but really I
recommend having a wet brush for any of
the shades really so I'm going to go
into the purple shade right here this is
one where you don't need a water with it
but again I think they all look better
with some water added to them and again
I really do think they all look better
with your fingers but we're just gonna
see how we do for right now I need to
get my nails filled so they're always
long in general but now they're like
extremely extremely long so it's really
difficult for me to be like continually
putting my fingers in there but I think
we're just gonna have to go ahead and do
it so I'll just show how it looks if I
use my finger so there it is with my
finger I just yeah I definitely just
feel like you can get better payoff I
just really didn't want to use my finger
today I'm just getting real tired of
putting my fingers in this palette which
I mean I knew that going into it I'm
gonna come back with the brush and kind
of get this inner part of my eye that I
can't get with my finger I knew that
going into it so it's not like I bought
it and that was like wait what you have
to use your finger but I will say that
I'm not as I'm not as excited about this
palette that I thought I would be I love
Katy and desi I really do there are some
of my absolute favorites I was so hyped
for this entire collection I bought as
much as I could as much as I thought
that I would like really get a lot of
use out of but I'm not having the best
time with with what I got I do like this
eyeshadow palette I definitely I mean I
think it is
but it's just it's really really hard to
work with and I figured it was gonna be
difficult to work with when they're like
two shades you have to use you know
water with and you have to use all of
them with your fingers I'm kind of like
wait what and the only reason the only
reason I bought a palette like this was
because of how much I love Katy and desi
because any other palettes or shadows
that say that I do not buy because I'm
not into it I bought it solely because
of them so I'm going to come back in
with my finger shades in here are
definitely fun
definitely more just you know kind of
toppers you know eyeshadow toppers I
knew I wasn't gonna be able to get a
full you know I look out of this palette
and I understand that so those shades
are fun I do find the the bronzing shade
this one right here I did use it the
other day and that one isn't quite as
unique to me I feel like I have a lot of
other shades like that this one is
really pretty but you definitely do need
water with it because the fallout is so
intense like even with water it still
has a ton of Fallout so overall for the
girls palette I mean if you love Katy
and desi I totally get wanting this
palette and wanting to support I really
do it's just been really difficult to
work with and some days when I'm doing
my makeup I'm just like I want to reach
for it because I like the colors and I
think that they're pretty but I'm like I
don't want to go through all of that
work just have some spray on my eye it
just seems like a lot of work and I'm so
sad I mean I've been there I'm gonna
keep the palette in and it's fun to play
with it and all of that it's extremely
messy I don't know if you can tell from
my palate like it is extremely a messy
palette I don't know if I want to say
that I expect it to love this because
going into it and knowing that you know
you were gonna have to really work with
the shadows I don't know if I really
expected to like absolutely love it
but I don't think I expected to not love
it as much as I do it's just it's just a
lot of work for these shadows that I
feel like I
similar shadows to in my collection like
I said I love Katie I love Disney and
I'm not trying to be me and I'm not
trying to bash on them and I'm not
trying to bash on this I'm just trying
to be honest because I know a restock is
coming in September I know a lot of
people have been asking me about this I
hope my opinions and my feedback helps
you out a little bit to my face I did
put on a little bit of primer when I was
off camera as well and then I'm gonna go
in with the foundation that I featured
in that haul that I picked up from Ulta
from Estee Lauder the double wear nude
water fresh makeup the first thing that
I noticed I opened this up and I'm like
wait a second there's no pump why is
this a $42 foundation and it don't even
have a pump for me I was like what and I
said something on my snapchat and
everyone was like you can buy one and
the math ones fit and I'm like yeah
that's great but those are like what ten
twelve dollars so we're now now we're
talking over fifty dollars for a
foundation Estee Lauder what are you
doing I was so unimpressed with that
like so unimpressed with that because
it's so hard especially because this
foundation is so liquidy I think I'm
gonna shake it up right now I mean I
could sit here and shake all day it is
still incredibly liquidy so then when I
have to pour it out onto a brush and I
feel like I'm having a really difficult
time getting the best amount out so this
is my Sigma angled kabuki f-84 I
definitely like this foundation with a
brush especially something that's a
little bit more dense with a Beauty
Blender I just was like a hot streak EMS
so I'm just gonna pour a little bit on
here but I either pour too much or or
not enough I don't know if that's enough
and it's super liquidy so I feel like
you only need a little bit of foundation
and now I just like I'm making a mess I
mean for a high-end foundation that's
just embarrassing it I don't know cuz
then I start to blend it out and then
I'm like I don't know I don't think I
applied enough and then the day is that
I'm like okay you keep shorten yourself
on foundation like just really go for it
then I have
way too much foundation on I'm like I
can't I can't get a handle I can't get a
handle on the foundation so I haven't
honestly made up my mind about this one
yet but I'm really considering returning
it cuz it was $42 it don't have a pump I
feel like I can never get the right
amount of foundation I think the
coverage is decent it's a pretty medium
coverage I would say it feels fine on
the skin like I don't mind the way it
feels
it looks fine I don't feel like it's the
best looking foundation on me like I
feel like there's other foundations that
I definitely do like more but it's such
a hassle and it's just it's kind of like
the eyeshadow pail it all over again I
don't really enjoy reaching for it
because I just know I'm either gonna
have too little foundation I'm gonna
have too much foundation I'm gonna make
a mess when I have to pour it out I
don't want to go buy a pump and spend
even more money on this foundation I
would rather return this foundation and
I'm like on a foundation kick right now
I am trying out a ton of different
foundations and my full face force
impressions video and the follow up
video I was talking about the Yvonne she
the photo perfection foundation I think
is what it's called
that one is $51 and it's the bomb I'm
loving that foundation still so for $10
more I'm gonna just keep using the
Givenchy one I've also tried a nice one
from a Lancome I've really been thinking
that one I don't know that Estee Lauder
one is not really impressing me
I've been trying the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD that one I feel like I like
even more so honestly I think I'm gonna
return it if you guys really enjoy this
foundation and you don't mind the whole
no pump thing I mean I think the
coverage is good and I think it looks
nice on my skin but I don't think it's
enough for me to keep it at $42 and just
get frustrated every time that I have to
use it and like have to finagle and mess
with it so freaking much like it's just
kind of annoying me so I think I might
actually be returning that one which
sucks cuz it was ten times points but I
can't help it like I tried it I like it
I like the actual foundation but not
enough to keep it I don't think mm-hmm
just gonna run through my concealer
quick because I didn't have anything new
from that hall like concealer setting
powder wise so I'm gonna use the Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer urban decay
did send me this in a package and I'm
totally taking this concealer I'm in the
shade light to bronze I'm going to use
the bronzer that I picked up from Sigma
this is in the saddle I have been trying
this out and I am impressed this is a
really gorgeous bronzer it is so
pigmented like you need a very very
light hand I mean with the morphe and
5:27 i wanted to try this as a bronzer
brush for quite some time now so I'm
excited to give it a try but I'm also
kind of risk is I'm like okay how much
am I gonna pick up cuz it is really
really really pigmented but I love this
shade I think it is absolutely gorgeous
in my brows off-camera so I'm gonna come
in and finish up the eyes I just put a
bit of a brown liner onto the waterline
and then I'm gonna grab this first shape
that we went in what I'm going to use my
Sigma e30 this is another pencil brush
that I picked up in my latest Sigma haul
I have like two or three of these now
but my pencil brushes I mean I use them
nearly every single day so I like to
have backups of them so I don't feel
like I'm constantly washing them look
the purple shade that we used and just
use the same brush and I'm gonna sweep
that on the lower lash line as well my
inner corner and brow bone I'm gonna
grab my morphe e36
I'm gonna spray it again with my pure
setting spray because I'm gonna go into
this shade right here this is one that
they say to use with water is going to
dip in to that shade the shade has a ton
of Fallout even if you use water and I'm
just going to place that one on to the
inner corner it's really really
beautiful but man it just it just be
hard to work with and it really gets
everywhere so just gonna lightly tap it
under the brow as well I didn't want to
make it sound like I completely hated
the girls palette cuz I don't hate it
like I said like I'm
return it I'm gonna keep it I'll
continually be reaching for it it just
it was harder than I expected to be able
to work with and I expected it to be
hard to work with it was even harder
than I thought that's the only thing
that like bums me out the fallout is
kind of you know a little bit crazy and
it you know if you're someone who if you
don't have nails and you 100% don't care
like even if I didn't have nails because
I've not you know had nails every single
day of my entire thirty years of
existence I still just don't like
putting my fingers and makeup I don't
like doing it I finally started when I
put primer on I finally started putting
primer on a Beauty Blender and then
putting it on my face because I don't
like the feeling of primer on my fingers
if you've watched my past videos you
probably hear me say that especially
when it comes to silicone based primers
I'm like but my fingers like I don't
know what it is and that doesn't have
anything to do with me having nails it's
just I don't like putting my fingers in
makeup it just is what it is so but if
that's something that doesn't bother you
at all I think I think you would like
the pellet even more than I do and then
again it's just like do you need these
shades because I just kind of feel like
I have all of them already but I don't
know I think it's good I'm happy to be
able to support two of my favorite
youtubers that's what means a lot to me
this packaging is sick like I love the
way that it looks it just is not my
favorite is all with my eyes finished
I'm going to finish off my face I'm
going to go back into the wildflower
palette and pick up the blush this is an
SL miss glam angled blush brush the to5
from the tail glam brush block is if
into the blush which is called peony
which is so sweet because I'm actually
filming this on Thursday which is my 4
year wedding anniversary and my wedding
flowers or peonies so fun fact for
highlight I'm gonna go into the
highlight which is called peaceful I'm
going to use my fo3 which is my
favorites highlighting brush this
highlight is gorgeous because it almost
kind of has that bit of like it's almost
like a silver iridescent almost which I
was not really expecting but I think it
is so fun I think it's gorgeous and I
feel like it's a unique highlighter for
me because I definitely
rotate towards you know a lot of the
same highlight shades I feel like that's
not like something super shocking to say
but I feel like this is actually pretty
different than a lot of my standards
like Silver's or you know kind of goals
or kind of pinky highlights or white
highlights pearl you know things like
that I feel like with this almost kind
of silver to it it's just something a
little bit different and I actually
really appreciated that so before I move
on to the lip I want to talk about just
a few other products that I picked up in
that hall to give kind of my feedback on
one is from dose of colors I did pick
this up at Ulta you can find dose of
colors at Ulta as well this was from
their Mint collection it's an ideal duo
in mint to be so this is what it looks
like and then on the top if you pop this
open it has kind of like your mint base
here it's kind of like a sticky almost
like tacky eyeshadow put that on as a
base and then when you open up the cap
here have your mint pigment here which
is so so gorgeous I will link an
Instagram video down below I did a
tutorial using this ideal duo you can
see it in action it's stunning it is
beautiful at first I was a little bit on
the fence about it because it just was
kind of hard to get the actual like
pigment out of the sifter I felt like I
was having to wait a long time like
trying to get as much product out as I
could but once I did it actually is
super super gorgeous and I feel like it
just goes so well like not shade wise
because of course they're supposed to go
together but I just feel like having
that kind of sticky base that you put on
first I feel like it just really lacks
that pigment in there and looks really
gorgeous less expensive I think it was
like $25 but I do really like it and the
lip color that I picked up from dose of
colors and the mint collection this is
mint tea I'm using that in that tutorial
and the look is actually the one that I
have in my Ulta 21 days of beauty video
that I did so I'll also leave that down
below because you can see the ideal duo
in action and also the mint tea on my
lips this is gorgeous I love the dose of
colors liquid lipsticks I highly
recommend them really really impressed
if this is your type of shade I would
say go for minty or just try out the
dose of colors look at lipsticks in
general because then the bottom also
from Ulta I did pick up
wet-and-wild highlighter I got the one
in precious puddles because everybody
raves about these I finally went ahead
and picked them up it's definitely very
beautiful I have worn this several times
now I have no complaints about it I get
why people are recommending the wet and
wild highlighters for the price I think
that you can't go wrong they had a ton
of different shades in there that you
can choose from I really love precious
pebbles and I can actually see myself
picking up more to try out a few
different shades so for lips I actually
have four different lipsticks to talk
about in addition to that dose of colors
that I picked up from that hall the one
was from Sigma Beauty this was also a
part of their wildflower collection the
one I picked up was in barely blooming
and I just thought it would be a really
nice nude unfortunately it is too nude
on me like it was too light on me it
didn't look the greatest when I did try
it out I had to put a lip gloss on top
of it I put a candy box from Mac on top
of it and then I thought it looked
really good because candy box has a bit
of a pink tinge so then it kind of
helped me not look like I had concealer
lips so that one was a bit of a bummer
so I wouldn't want to wear it in this
video and then I also picked up this one
was from Ulta this is a new matte
lipstick from Anastasia Beverly Hills
the shade I picked up was in dead roses
because I thought it would be a really
beautiful fall color and it definitely
is I will say I feel like I've been
seeing a lot of people really hype up
these lipsticks and a lot of people are
saying they are creamy I did not find
this to be a creamy lipstick at all it
is a matte lipstick so I did not expect
it to be creamy which was kind of
throwing me off when people are like
it's super creamy cuz I'm like really a
matte lipstick but when I put it on it
literally like skipped across my lips
and the application actually looked
really terrible on me I had to grab out
a lip pencil and like fix it because my
lips are all getting a little bit crazy
but after that then I thought it looked
really pretty the color was absolutely
beautiful so so far I'm not completely
100% sold on Dee's I liked the matte
finish I felt like it did have pretty
good long wearing power for a regular
lipstick but I feel like I still need to
give this one a couple more tries before
I make a final decision again I did like
the color but I don't know the
application process was a little bit on
the tricky side then the final lipsticks
that I picked up from that haul we're
both from
does the xkt collection of what the dose
of colors I picked up both of the
irregular lipsticks and I picked up both
of the nudes and unfortunately neither
one neither one worked out for me so
when I put on no shade I kind of had
that same effect as the Sigma lipstick
where it was just too late to nude on me
it kind of like washed everything out
this was another one that I think I used
candy box from Mac again put a lip gloss
to top it because I just it just didn't
look great on me which I was very sad
about other nude is more creamer please
and I thought I would like this one a
lot more because it is a bit darker but
unfortunately this one did not look good
on me either it kind of had a very
strange like orangish undertone on me I
don't know it was a little strange I
felt like I could still get away with it
I was like I'll just try it out and I
wore it in a video and oh my word like
everybody hated me I felt like I ruined
people's days ruined their days by
wearing this lipstick I'm because some
of the comments I just wanted to like I
am so sorry I'm so sorry that your worst
part of your day was a lipstick that
didn't look good on me from the
onslaught of comments about that
lipstick in the video that I award and I
don't think I will ever wear more
creamer please because wow people were
very angry just neither one looked great
on me and I was super bummed about that
because I loved nude lipsticks I'm
obsessed with nudes I own so many nudes
I just I was actually shocked that these
two nudes did not work out for me
unfortunately these did not work for me
which is a bummers so actually instead
of putting on any of these I'm just
gonna move on to something else
I got these in the mail recently in a PR
package these are from milk makeup
they're just called their lip colors and
I'm freaking obsessed with them like I
am loving on them and I want to try this
dark shade to see if I can pull off a
darker eye and a darker lip I don't know
if it'll work but we're gonna give it a
try this one is in the shade dip out
this is what it looks like
and yeah I'm just so far I've been so
impressed I think I've tried two or
three different colors the staying power
is crazy
these also dry
Matt on the lips and they're just super
pigmented I just think they're really
pretty so we're gonna go ahead and see
what this dark lip looks like everyone's
into these fall colors so I'm pulling
out all of my dark lipstick so uh here
we go this is what dip out it looks like
on mmm that was definitely a very fall
vampy color Brad you like it with the
axe I've been very impressed with these
milk makeup lip colors I believe there
are $22 I will link them down below you
