today's video is going to be a little
bit different a couple weeks ago I
posted a video of the two hundred dollar
shopping list drugstore versus high-end
I'll have that video linked down below
had a subscriber write in and I actually
remember to keep the screenshot on my
phone so I'll put it up here but she
said you could do a recommendations
slash what I'd buy with an X amount gift
card from different brands to and I
thought that was a really fun idea so i
screenshotted it and i got it on my list
and i really wanted to do it so that's
what i'm gonna be doing today i'm gonna
be doing two different brands today some
of like my most loved brands and brands
that i've been purchasing from for a
very very long time so i'm gonna be
going through both pur cosmetics and
then also sigma Beauty I'm going to be
saying if you have a $150 gift card to
each of those websites what is it that I
would recommend it to you what is it
that I would suggest yep that would be
good to use your gift card on know that
you guys are excited for this idea and
thank you to a Cheban for writing in the
suggestion because I thought it would be
really fun so if you wanted to see what
I would recommend with these gift cards
to appear in Sigma why don't we go ahead
and get started pretty so first I'm
gonna start with a pier because if you
are new to my channel pier is one of the
makeup brands that I have been buying
from for like 10 plus years so I thought
it would be fun to start with them so I
have a couple products here like I said
I'm gonna be doing one hundred and fifty
dollars I couldn't decide between 100
and 200 I kind of had them both out
there and then I thought let's just go
middle ground and we'll go 150 so that's
what we're gonna be doing and I am gonna
be going off of their website prices
because I'm saying if you have a gift
card to them specifically so instead of
doing like a Sephora or Aalto or
anything like that
join me to the brands websites so that's
where I am getting the prices from but
first up from pur cosmetics and
eyeshadow palette like this was one of
the first things I've talked in my head
when I thought of pure and it is they're
trolls action appellate I really enjoyed
this eyeshadow palette I said really
good things about it on my channel and I
still definitely groove that I would
still recommend it it went away for a
while it was limited edition because
it's in collaboration with trolls and
dreamworks but when it came back i was
telling everybody it's been good stock
its back in stock if you want to go get
it
i think the quality of these eyeshadows
are really really good and i
they do enjoy the colors I like that you
have enough neutrals in here to create
you kind of feel like you're more basic
going to look but then you also have
these really fun and pops of colors in
here these blues that this teal and the
blue is really gorgeous this hot pink is
really fun as well that orange I swear
almost every time I go into this palette
that orange somehow makes it onto my
face it just says I just really enjoyed
that orange but then you also have these
really nice shimmers as well and again
the quality of this eyeshadow palette I
think is really really good on the
Pierre website right now it is listed
for $23 which I don't think that is a
bad price you get a mirror with it it's
nice and easy to travel with as well and
I just really enjoyed this palette I've
recommended it quite a bit and next up I
want to recommend a mascara this is such
a good mascara and every time I put this
mascara on I'm like oh yeah dang this is
a really phenomenal mascara this is the
big look mascara it's gonna say the pur
big look mascara but it's from pure but
did this is the big look at mascara and
this is just a really freaking nice
mascara
it's $21 and this is what the wand looks
like it might not look like anything at
too crazy because it's kind of like a
thicker wand I would say but it does
amazing things for the lashes and I
pulled this out the other day to use I'm
not doing a no lash look and I was like
yep but still I mean it's still just
freaking phenomenal I think I mentioned
that as a pure fully charged mascara I
think goes in my empties video and I
said you know I like that mascara but I
was like there's another pair mascara
that I love more than that and I
couldn't think if it was called big look
or big lash it's big look and I would
highly recommend this one if you're
someone who doesn't wear lashes and you
don't mind investing in mascaras this is
a really good quality mascara not only
to give your lashes length but also
volume and that's what I need because I
have really short lashes and also really
thin lashes so I like a mascara that
does both and the big look does both for
me
so another palette that I wanted to
recommend I there was other palettes
that I could recommend also but I wanted
to include this one in addition to the
eyeshadow palette because I actually
really like this one for face shades so
this is the gold digger palette again if
you are not new to my channel you have
seen me recommend this several times
over its been in favorites videos this
is just one of my favorite palettes
especially for the face shades in here I
think it is a really cool concept though
it does have a mirror and then it
actually
pops up these are called the NIV
palettes and that's because you can pop
up the mirror to kind of create your own
little vanity I especially take these
traveling with me quite a bit because I
like how it pops up and it's just easier
for me to do my makeup
it does have eyes shadows shades over
here but I especially love the bronze at
the blush and the highlight I think all
three are absolutely stunning this one
is on sale as well on the Pierre website
right now for $25 I believe it is it's
originally listed a little bit higher
than that but I saw it was on sale for
25 I think these are also limited
edition because there was another one of
these vanity palettes and I don't see it
anymore so if you would be interested in
something like this I would highly
recommend getting it because it is on
sale and I think it's gonna go away but
this is one of my favorite palettes I
recommend it so much as well and these
you've probably never heard me talk
about so I'm really excited to share
about these these are the pure lashes so
no I love the pure lashes these are my
favorite lashes I talk about them all
the time I'm always recommending them I
just highly enjoy them and I was making
the list together I immediately put diva
and bombshell on my list and then I was
like no just pick one and then I was
like no I love both and typically when I
purchase of the eye lashes from Pierre I
just purchased them I purchased both at
the same time I purchased Eva and
bombshell and I wear them both I maybe I
wear diva just a little tiny bit more
than bombshell I thought I would just do
pure and bombshell
I love the pure lashes and I'm always
recommending them I think that they are
so easy to apply I've reused them
multiple multiple times over just some
of my favorite lashes they're $14 so if
you picked up two pairs I would
recommend diva and warm shell next up I
have an eyeliner that I want to
recommend this is the pier on point
eyeliner I only have one shade so far
it's the brown and it's in down to earth
I want to get more of these because
these are really phenomenal eyeliners
they are very creamy in the waterline
they show up right away they don't tug
or scratch at the waterline which I
appreciate so much and they're also very
very long-lasting another really good
thing about these is that they are a
self sharpener so you can see like on
the tip here it says sharpen so when you
to put the cap on and you twist it
you're actually sharpening the pencil at
the same time which i think is great so
you always have it's called the OnPoint
you always have a sharp
point to your eyeliner which i think is
awesome you don't have to worry about
sharpening it yourself or anything like
that one of my favorite liners I
definitely want to repurchase more of
these and I would highly recommend these
are $19 and then the last item that I
have on here is a skincare product fear
does have an entire line of skincare if
you are not familiar with that they do
have more than just makeup I like quite
a few of their skincare products and I
send them all out the other night when I
was making this and I was like if I had
to pick one skincare product what would
be the one that I really really
recommend and because I love
moisturizing and I think it's such a key
step in skincare I went with the soak it
up intense hydrating moisturizer well I
think this packaging is just awesome
it's a $34 moisturizer and I read this I
feel like it just looks like an
expensive skincare product right I think
the packaging is awesome and then at the
moisturizer you get quite a bit of
product in here it says it's intense
hydrating and you can tell it right as
you're applying it to your face you are
getting that instant hydration and for
me and for the winter that we have been
dealing with it's snowing again outside
I don't know what the lighting is doing
cuz it's like it's dreary out but it's
snowing at the same time so I wasn't
your vegetable morning light out so I
don't know what the lighting is gonna
look like in this video but we have had
a really cold winter which means I have
been very very dry so this is a
moisturizer that I reached for quite a
bit so I would recommend pure skincare
like I said I've tried on a lot of their
different products but if I had to
recommend one item for you to try out to
start trying out the pure skincare with
and you have that a gift card I would do
these soakin up intense hydrating
moisturizer so all of that should equal
from the pure website exactly 150
dollars I was like wow spot-on girl I
was pretty proud of myself when I put
that list together and I added
everything up I was like ooh am I gonna
be closer am I gonna be under right now
one hundred and fifty dollars so those
would be my top of recommendations of
from pure cosmetics so next up I want to
move over to a sigma beauty and I did
want to include Sigma because I feel
like Sigma is one of the brands that I
actually get asked individually quite a
bit I get a lot of like snapchat
messages even emails from people saying
that they're about to make a purchase
from Sigma and what is it that I would
recommend so I thought this would be
cool one to add into this video I think
the number one item that I recommend the
most from a sigma Beauty especially when
people are telling me they're starting
to build up their makeup brush
collection is
the most wonít makeup brush a set with
five different brushes in here at face
and eye brushes and these are all some
of my absolute favorite brushes from
sigma so i highly recommend getting the
set which I believe is $73 on the Sigma
website so it comes with the f80 flat
kabuki brush this I feel like is one of
the most like well known most a lot of
Sigma brushes out there a flat top
kabuki I use it for foundation and it's
just one of those like staple foundation
brushes that I've always had in my
collection I've started purchasing from
Sigma even before I have a channel and
they're just really nice high-quality
brushes you do pay a little bit more
with Sigma but they last really long all
of my brushes I've never had a brush
fall apart on me I've been able to clean
them as several times over and I've
never had any issues with my Sigma
brushes so you definitely aren't getting
quality brushes out of them and the f80
I just feel like is a staple the next
space bar stuff is in there is the
tapered highlight this is the f-35 again
this is just like one of those classic
highlight brushes but it's really really
nice for dusting on highlight and it's
actually what I used I actually oh no I
used a different brush I'm gonna
recommend but I did use this brush today
for my highlight brush so this is the
f-35 and then there's also three eye
brushes in here the first one here is
the f40 this is like hands-down one of
my top recommended Sigma brushes I love
the f40 it's the tapered blending brush
it's just a big fluffy blending brush
and this is the one that I use today to
buff that first color into my crease
this is just a staple it comes with me
traveling all the time I have to have
that for you in my collection the other
one I feel the same way about this is
the e25 this is just called a blending
brush this is just a bit smaller and
more dense I want to concentrate a color
on the outer part of my eye or if I
really want to blend something into my
crease but have it be a little bit more
precise I will use the e25 again I'm
always recommending the e25 and then the
final version there is the pencil brush
at the e30 this a pencil brush is just
something that's needed in your
collection and this was a brush that I
didn't have in my collection for the
longest time and when I finally got the
pencil brush I was like oh yeah I should
have gotten the e30 a lot sooner this is
just really nice for a lash line work
you can play shadows on the lower lash
line you can add them to the inner part
of your eye or you can even use this for
crease work as well like really detailed
crease work you can use the pencil brush
for it so so I would say that this brush
set with the
five brushes in the most wanted side I
think this is the item that I most often
recommend when people ask me about Sigma
brushes because I think it's a good
value and you get five really awesome
quality brushes so the foundation
brushes that I did use today and this
brush is just so good this is the 3d HD
max kabuki brush this is a big old brush
I mean like look at her she is a big
brush she has all these different kind
of like angles to it so when you are
doing your makeup this is super super
quick at applying foundation again it is
what I use today but because it's so
large and also because it has these nice
angles you can get into every part of
your face you can get by your nose you
can get in between your eyebrows and it
just makes the foundation work so quick
I love to travel with this one because
when I'm in a hurry and I just need a
sheet my foundation this is the brush
that's doing it for me it is $27 it's a
pricier brush but it's one that I use so
I think this is probably my most used
foundation brush once they came out with
this because it is a bit newer this I
think replaced my f80 as my most used
foundation brush I just think it's
really quick really easy and I just have
nothing but good things to say about
this brush the next item that I would
recommend is also a newer item from
Sigma I really wanted to include
something in there brush cleaning line
because Sigma I feel like is most well
known for their brushes but they're also
very well known for brush cleaning and
taking care of your brushes they have
several different items out there they
have brush cleaners they have gloves to
actually like clean the brushes on but
one of my favorite items as of recently
is the newer product to them and I feel
like it's just kind of a two-in-one so I
really enjoy it for that reason it's
called the sake magic scrub I did review
this in a video not too long ago but I
did want to mention it it's $19 so on
the back it has these little suction
cups and I just suction it to my sink
and then what you do this is what it
looks like on the inside I just used it
if you can't tell and then so I suction
it to the sink and then this is actually
a cleaner so this is was actually
cleaning your brushes the white in here
is a soap that is cleaning your brushes
disinfecting them getting the bacteria
off getting the makeup off and then it
also has these little ridges in here so
it's actually going through and really
cleaning out all of the bristles and I
really like the two-in-one so I thought
I would recommend this over doing the
like Sig Magic foam or liquid I would
recommend both as
and then also purchasing a glove which I
would recommend as well and I have
instead of getting both of those this is
just really nice quick handy and easy to
use and this is kind of what I've been
going for when I am cleaning my brushes
thank you fitted myself pulling out the
sig magic because it's just super easy I
love that it's hands-free and I can just
stick this to my sink and clean my
brushes that way so this is the one that
I would recommend and again the sig
matric scrub is $19 already I can tell
the lighting is getting worse and worse
I polished it just pulled my ring hood
out I'm trying to learn how to make
videos brighter when I edit I'm not very
good at it yet but I'm gonna have to do
it for this one but we're almost done I
just have two more items left like I
said it's segment to me is most well
known for their brushes a brush carrot
cleaning but I also do like some makeup
items from them as well so I wanted to
recommend a few here this one here is
the wildflower palette and this has a
shades and a face shades and I think
that's why I enjoy it so much I really
love all-inclusive palettes not only for
eye looks but when they also include
face shades it's just a bonus for me so
it does have a mirror here and then you
have four different eyeshadow shades the
beautiful terracotta blush here and then
I really really nice highlight I like
these shades as well and I like it
because it's a really simple palette but
sometimes I just need that simple makeup
look I need to go into a palette and
just I know exactly what I'm getting out
of it I know what I like I'm creating
with it and I feel like that's what I
get with the Wildflower palette so I've
taken this one traveling with me quite a
bit and I think it's because I really
like just being able to reach into it
and it's quick simple easy but it's all
getting a really nice a quality
eyeshadow palette and this one is $36
and then the final item that I would
have to recommend is one of their liquid
lipsticks this is also a newer to Sigma
but I really enjoy their liquid
lipsticks I mentioned new mod in my top
20 nude and pink a lipstick shades and
this was the one that I actually
mentioned and I said if you'd want to
see a colorful one of that which a lot
of people said yes so I have it on my
list but foxglove from Sigma is one of
my favorite shades just like hands-down
I love the shade whenever I wear it I
get so many compliments on it it's such
a different color for me because I
definitely do prefer nudes
it's like a bright black berry pink type
of color but I think it is gorgeous and
I love wearing it I really do like the
Sigma formula it's a bit on the drier
side but it's not irritating to my lips
and it doesn't look unflattering on them
but it's really really long-lasting
these are $15 I believe it is I just
a really good liquid lipstick formula
but box club especially if you like
these kind of brighter colors I would
definitely recommend this one because
this is a favorite shade of mine so with
all of those products from Sigma the
total was one hundred and seventy
dollars but I am a Sigma affiliate I do
have a discount code for 10% off them so
if you were to do with the 170 and then
you were to use my code which is
Samantha it would be 153 okay that's not
too bad
that's not too bad pretty that is pretty
darn close and it usually was Sigma when
you do place an order if it's over a
certain amount they also throw in a free
gift they change it from time to time
sometimes it's like a mini brush I've
seen a full-size brush I've seen some
makeup products in there as well so
typically you will also get a free
product in there so I know I kind of
cheated a bit because I have a code but
if there's a code out there I don't see
why you wouldn't use it you don't have
to use my code you could use someone
else's code but getting at least 10% off
I mean that took us from 170 to 153
which I do not think is bad so I only
want three dollars over on the Sigma one
I think that's pretty good but I feel
really solid and all those
recommendations that I gave and that
would be what I would suggest it for you
$150 Sigma gift card I guess if I was
gonna do it for today's video and
sharing my gift card or recommendations
to pur cosmetics and also Sigma beauty
of course everything will be listed in
the description box it down below I will
have everything linked out there as well

these and see more brand recommendations

do it I had so much fun creating these
lists and I thought it was a really good
idea so let me know of course if you
want to see more of these and as always
