I'm going to be attempting to flog this
is why first I'm going to vlog and I
really have no idea how this is going to
go but I've been getting so many
requests to start vlogging and even
though I feel like my life is really not
that interesting
I said that I would go ahead and give it
a shot if you follow me on snapchat you
understand the difficulty of trying to
hook my camera onto my mini tripod that
I bought for this reason for vlogging
but we've gotta figure out so I'm just
going to take you around my days and
show you guys what I do I know I got a
lot of questions about like my work
schedule how I work my organization
throughout my day and things like that
so hopefully throughout the course of
the vlogs I can answer some of those
questions and just give you a little
glimpse into my life what I actually
want to take you guys through first is
that I have some mail that came in my PO
Box from subscriber friends which is so
so cool and I thought I could share it
on the vlog what they sent along so we
can kind of unbox them together I know a
lot of people do like PR hauls and
things like that but it just means so
much to me when a subscriber friends and
it's me something like that's just
totally amazing so I thought it could be
really fun to go through those boxes
together do a little bit of an embossing
and then I'll get back into my work
schedule and take you guys along with me
there so let's open some packages I'm
just going to sit on my floor like I
have no idea how to like position the
camera hold the camera so these first
couple vlogs they're probably going to
be like incredibly awkward but stick
with me because we're trying something
new but first up I've got a box from my
friend can get all the way from Italy
which is like insane
I can't even kind of can't believe this
package you've been made in because you
always hear like horror stories about
international shipping but I'm just so
thankful I love her so much we talk on
snapchat almost every single day and
well probably every single day and it's
just really cool to make these types of
connections and it reminds me of all the
good social media does have and know
definitely get a line negativity but it
also opens these types of doors because
without it I would have never been able
to make a friend in Italy so this is
amazing I can't believe she sent me a
package I tried to open it so I wasn't
going to be opening it on camera and I
opened it upside down because that's
what I do you know like when you go to a
restaurant they give you your like to go
container
I always put mine in upside down my
husband's like what's wrong with you I
don't know it's just why I love my life
but so everything kind of like spilled
out by hey I tried to shove some things
back into the wrapper so I could still
see it's like be surprised and stuff but
why don't we go ahead and open it I know
she's a huge fan of parts so it's so
funny because became in a tart box and
there's like the tart paper in here too
which I thought was awesome she's always
telling me how much she loves heart so I
see here at the tart and graveyard girl
the swamp Queen palette I don't have
this palette that is so exciting that is
so so cool I don't even know can you get
this anymore I'm not sure if you can
because it is a collaboration but that
is so cool oh here's Aries if you guys
follow me on snap
she's a peach law and she's a she's very
curious oh my gosh this packaging is
awesome Oh looks so cool who else has
this palette and do you love it and do
you want to see me trade some look on
Instagram with it so I'm so so excited
like some of these shades just have me
super super pumped thank you that's so
cool and we'll have that palettes like
awesome Aries Aries the next step I see
I see the more key label I feel it more
relatable how do I get into this oh and
I don't have any polish on my nails I
just went and got is done when I get my
nails done I just have them fill it
because I have acrylics I just had him
do the fill and then I paid him at home
because I have so much nail polish I
love nail polish and I like to like
change out my shades every couple days
so at first I thought I was really crazy
member one day like showing on my
Instagram I'm like look at all these
different nail polishes like it spent
like I can't do shellac nail polish
because it's a pair of
to get off but like there's no point in
wasting our time I'm just looking at
this it's like a Catholic lifestyle it
is literal is holding in my hands
talking about nails
it's the morphe and kathleenlights
palette that is amazing I want it this
one I think I put this in my makeup that
I regretted not buying so that is so so
cool
I also I apologize I don't have any
makeup on today's like my makeup free
day and of course the day they don't
like let's start vlogging but I mean if
you follow me on snapchat you know like
I have no shame in my game I don't wear
makeup 24/7 this is so cool so probably
a lot of my blogs you'll see me makeup
free as well oh my gosh I can't believe
these shadows these I have appelles are
making it all the way from Italy like to
me in one piece
isn't that so so pretty this is amazing
I did not think I was going to be able
to get this palette
and if you know me you know that I cry a
lot so it's just like really it's just
overwhelming to me you know how you
feeling overwhelmed Aires it's just
overwhelming to you that like the
kindness of people like it's crazy to me
I can't oh just like hard to it's just
hard to wrap my mind around huh girl I
know because like it's so exciting to
get packages for brands and you know
companies that think like you're good
enough and they really want to work with
you but when you're getting high just
from your friends like that's a totally
different story man that's totally
different so next up I see from TARDIS
is the wild animal custom magnetic
palette so that sounds to me like a Z
palette right a magnetic palette look at
this look at how cute and that is area
I'm sorry she's going to be like in
literally ever shot there's nothing I
can really do about this this was the
facialist nicknames are velcro Vishal is
like she is always right by my side so
that is what it is so it is the magnetic
palette so you can play singles in here

where I film and work and my store
everything and pathol makeup and books
and everything and I've just been trying
to find some better organization and she
said that she was going to send me a box
to try to help with that so let's just
get started I really have no idea what
to expect but I'm so excited like this
was so seriously kind like who does that
when someone's like oh I'm trying to
organize and someone's like I'll
basically like be your interior designer
except I'm an ro1 she's in California
like I literally was sending her photos
and snaps of like parts of my office and
like dimension some things like
seriously like sick but kindness this is
like out of control so oh this is cute
okay oh look there's no oh my gosh she
has sent me packages before and she had
like the best little notes she said this
is a mail holder but I'll look at it and
see and I show the pellet holder in
display case also I was thinking I said
I think in mine at the same one I had
nine paladin a that's awesome so here
you so I'll be able to put Pelops in
this and display it oh I'm just so
excited to get better organized my
office is just unlike overwhelming me
lately it's been it's crazy I love it
but no something's I feel like I'm like
doing a scavenger hunt or something so
these are these I love these are so nice
into
or if you want them on your desk they
sit well there too I use these ones for
my bronzers and blushes oh yes yes yes
yes so the partition is great because it
helps the bronzer stand up and you can
easily tell what you have instead of
stacking everything that is um okay so I
got two of these and there is there's a
little partition right in the middle I'm
just imagining like I'm already trying
to up here just just getting organized
again you could use it for foundations
or primers or if you put them in the
counter on your bathroom and your
skincare I might actually use it for
that yes yes I might actually do that I
was actually working on my bathroom this
past weekend and I wish I had something
to set my skincare in so then when I
cleaned out my sink like I feel like
sometimes that I delay creating my think
because it's tiring to grab all like the
individual bottles off my sink if I can
put them in one thing that could be cool
I'm excited about them oh you actually
have I'm looking at the top of my desk
because I think I have one other one
just so like this from her as well and I
have a bunch of like sheet masks in it
for your sheet masks yep yep yep
that's awesome umm yeah I have one
sitting on top of my desk and I just
stack in and my sheet masks in there so
that's awesome because I have a lot of
sheet masks so I can use it as another
one yay gosh this is gorgeous I feel
like this is like Christmas oh my gosh
oh so this is for your makeup smudges so
areas can't get them ha ha that is so
awesome
oh that is so cool and it can be like
decorative as well Aries who has her
nose in the Box right now she has eaten
like five of my makeup sponges and it is
so frustrating slice so cute like that
is all that's so awesome
eridan to do various stuff so she's not
gonna be happy about that gift this one
is like a three stack says this I just
saw it Marshalls do you have those in
Iowa yes pretty sure we do and thought
it a nice size for some makeup is who
use for your setting powders pressed
powders or powder foundations you can
either set them up
stack them I think that would be awesome
I've been really wanting more like
acrylic organizer stuff I just really
like the way it looks so that's awesome
okay I gotta figure out what this is is
this another turbine on this stuff base
towel oh cool
Japanese this is this how they sell it
face oh I think it's how you say it I
got one for myself too which is feel so
soft I think they'll be great to dry our
faces off after we wash the makeup off
that's awesome she sent me a couple like
turbines - and like fun like bows and
stuff to wear my hair for when I take it
out itself not just feel super soft and
areas staring at it
and areas just Chuck's the face hell if
I knew how to like move my camera to
show you guys which is oh she took it
and ran under my desk
i'ma get it back so I'll make it a bet
so these are what I was thinking you
could use for your foundations and
primers these slots are perfect size for
them oh that is really cool she said I
asked my Nana drawer but I know you said
in your will I buy it you need
everything out and display so you
remember what you have yes that's true
these will fit nice and look neat on any
table or bookshelf yeah that's awesome
that's awesome yeah I do I need like
things like out in the open so I don't
forget about them because if I just like
storm away in a drawer like I just
completely forget I have a feeling this
one smash actually for me what's uh-oh
what is this girl oh my goodness oh oh
my goodness let me see and it's got two
squeakers inside oh oh
she said wishes know where to go because
my office is old stop she's so confused
she always sends along something for
areas and I appreciate it so much
Oh a greeny Street for jobs and this
looks like a really big boat oh my god
she's spoil area so much baked with
peanut butter all areas of Kennedy's
still faded over these I need to go
think that takeoff for Toyota but I'm so
cool thank you for thinking of areas oh
that's sweet I know I decided to like
open everything because I see sony a
5100 which overheats all the times I
don't only stone for like 13 minutes and
then I have to stop for 10 so like this
could take me a really long time so I
opened everything it's interesting
though because a lot of people say they
use the sony a 5100 first logging and
I'm like well how do you do that if you
can only record up to 13 minutes at a
time because I think of logging it's
just like setting your camera somewhere
and like letting it record what you
can't do it with this camera so I don't
know I'm a little confused but okay so I
got this cute little pink drawers right
here it because it has a perfect amount
of partitions in the Rose detail it's so
cute this can be used for your
highlighters or blush kilos I love all
this cute stuff it's going to look so
good and my office oh I just can't wait
okay this one says immediately put it in
my cart when I saw it because I knew you
would be able to use it for something
and I've looked at it and as I've looked
at it and had the idea you could use it
for your stick contours and highlighters
they might be perfect in here that's a
good idea to look I would love it thank
you so much religion is like freedom
Christmas right now oh this is so cool
because it's a nut says just that this
is an amazing organizer I have two of
them stacked on top of one another I put
all my lip eaten and my powder
foundations I was thinking you to use it
for your lip ease and lip liners yes yes
because look if oh yeah because if you
see it has like these two rollers that
is so cool I will definitely be using it
for some like lip liners they're going
to organize in drawers again these can
be used for blushes highlighters or
bronzers depending on the size this has
two partitions for even more division of
items you can even use them for small
eyeshadow palettes or single eyeshadows
so there is two fees this like look how
amazing this is it's like heavy
- it's just freaking beautiful so this
was the protecting I was looking to get
for you this is the perfect thing to
hold your morphe eyeshadow palettes you
can use it for other palettes as well
the size is nice and it is so pretty and
I know how much he likes the color dusty
rose so it's perfect I use mail sorters
that's what this is for palettes that
way I can just live in such an remember
you so once I have I really hope you
love this I think it's beautiful I think
it's beautiful too like this is so nice
okay it's just so overwhelming like it's
just just overwhelming but this is
awesome like this is going to be perfect
for my palate so like all of this is
just freaking amazing and I'm just so
thankful and I'm really grateful to
make--to
we talk on snapchat every single day as
well we email a lot too and then just
really means a lot to me and it really
can help me out
I send up my Instagram the other day I
always write down like my monthly goals
and one of my goals for toon is to
finish organizing my office so that's
all this is just really going to help me
out so much so just the time and energy
and effort and everything that was put
into getting these gifts from you just
it really means so much I'm making
bitches stir her own YouTube channel as
well i'll have her link down below and i
hope that you'll go check her out I was
like her third subscriber or something I
think and I'm so appreciative and for
them to do this for me like it's just
it's just wild
so I thought that could be a fun way to
kick off the blog I'll try to keep those
blogs as short as I can I know I don't
really have short videos and I thought
of having the blogs be extra videos on
my channel you know I usually post four
days a week Mondays Wednesdays and
Thursdays so I thought instead of taking
away like a regular content video
because I always have so many ideas of
what to film that it's hard to put them
into four days I thought that this could
be like a bonus line maybe like on the
weekend or something I could post a blog
but that was way fun that was just that
was so much fun so I hope that you guys
enjoy seeing that let me know in the
comment below if you did because I'd
like to know if you'd want to see more
Z's or not or if you think I should keep
them
different social media platform I'm just
let me know but just thank you - thank
you that was amazing
I'm going to go get emotional off-camera
my main goal right now is to be writing
my six book I want my first drafts
completely done by the end of June that
is another one of my June goals is to
get this first draft written so I can
get it out to my beta readers and just
get some early feedback of did they even
like the book did I like the characters
can I follow along easily so that is
mainly what I am working on today you
have to kind of take mini breaks I will
get on a roll where I will write like a
thousand words at a time and then when I
look up it's almost like I'm taking my
first breath and I just a lot of times I
can just feel exhausted and I just need
to take a quick breather I either need
to just get up and walk around I need to
like go get a glass of water I'll watch
a youtube video I'll check my email I'll
do something but when I'm in the full-on
writing process like I am now like
completely from scratch I'm not doing
rewrites or editing or anything like
that when I'm actually writing the book
it's just kind of the it's just kind of
the way that I do things I will write in
short fast first and then it's I just
need to just need to calm down and
recollect and come back in to me because
a lot of times when I write I just feel
like you know I kind of turn into a
different person I kind of go into my
characters mind and I am them and I need
to like refocus again so that's kind of
how my writing style is you guys do want
to see a blog focused you know mostly on
my writing process and things like that
where I can talk about a little bit more
let me know or let me know any questions
that you might have on the writing
process or just being an author or the
publishing process or anything like that
and then maybe I can address them in
depth log2 but yeah let's get some
writing done
okay
yes
have to break your jelly child living
caramel
Oh
yeah
get real
can't we
I'll be able to see it but I'm at 2271
which most of my chapters I write in
chapters most of my chapters are between
2,000 and 2,500 words so I'm pretty
excited I would like to write in
chapters and break it up and I just like
to have that kind of casual word count
goal of anywhere between 2000 and 2500
sometimes it's closer to 2000 sometimes
it even gets closer to like 2900 it just
kinda depends on what I'm feeling that
day but we're comical for this one is
good so just going to hit the Save
button and we can move on to a brand new
chapter
okay so I'm going to cut off my first
vlog here we'll see how much actually
makes it into this I've never tried to
edit a blog before so I really don't
know what to expect
but I hope that you guys enjoy the first
vlog I hope that you enjoyed seeing some
of the unboxings from my subscriber
friends I just thought that maybe would
be a fun way to kick off the vlog I'm
excited for this series and just letting
you guys see into my life I'm like I
said I work from home and this is what
you get most days as we make it free
playing with my dog and just working out
my computer that is my life but I know
it can be very interesting to see people
outside of like the element that you see
on YouTube and social media and I know a
lot of people like slug so hopefully
some days I'll actually be doing some
more interesting things that I can take
you along with but again let me know if
you want to see a blog dedicated on
writing if you have any questions that I
can include in that vlog because I would
be happy to do so but thank you guys so
