hi everybody thank you for watching so
today's video I'm going to attempt to
create my first halloween tutorial
probably my first and last halloween
tutorial of this year halloween is
almost here but i have been giving this
so many requests to do a halloween look
just on youtube in general on my
snapchat i even i did a giveaway through
my beauty newsletter like I do every
month and the only thing I ask in the
beauty newsletter giveaway in order to
get entered is to let me know what video
idea you want to see next and
eighty-five percent of people said a
Halloween luggage and I'm like man I I
was gonna try to put it off as much as I
could but I just I don't think that I
can so I'm going to attempt to make this
attempt being the word because I'm not
even sure of this video will see the
light of day but we're gonna attempt to
do something here today the reason why
I'm so nervous about it and so unsure
about it a I have never ever tried
halloween makeup in my life ever not
once I've never tried to be like crazy
and creative with my makeup it just it's
not me I'm not a very artistically
creative person and so when I think of
Halloween tutorials I think of just
being so artistic and so over-the-top
creative and I'm like that is not who I
feel like I am so I'm very intimidated
by doing halloween makeup especially
because obviously on youtube I feel like
this is like the makeup artist time to
thrive like they love Halloween and they
love creating and I'm like I I don't
know how to be that type of creative
person but I also reminded myself when I
was trying to decide if i was gonna film
this video I was like you know what hey
you're gonna try something that you've
never done before you're going to get
out of your comfort zone and you're
gonna try something that you have never
attempted in your 29 years like why why
not do that but I also I didn't want it
to hold me back because I used to hold
myself back from doing makeup because I
knew that I was never good at art and I
wasn't that artistically creative person
and so when I would try to do makeup and
I wouldn't get it right away I would
just stop completely because I was like
you know that's not what I'm good I'm
not good at that like why do I keep
trying I know that that's not my strong
suit so why keep trying why keep
practicing
and since getting on youtube you know
starting my own channel and watching so
many other channels and tutorials and
videos out there it has really helped
teach me about makeup I'm clearly no
expert yet but I you know I'm getting
more comfortable and doing my makeup I
in all through college I did not do my
makeup I always had my friends doing my
makeup for me because I didn't feel
confident enough to do it so I'm like
you know what you have to start
somewhere I shouldn't continually let my
thoughts about being artistically
creative hold me back so you know what
why don't we try something new and why
don't we just go for it so someone on my
snapchat sent me a couple of ideas and
she sent me this one it's a female
werewolf so I feel like female
werewolves are maybe a good place to
start like I was thinking maybe like a
cat or a lot of people were doing like
the plastic surgery 1 i'm like maybe
that doesn't look so bad but i don't
really have anything that i feel it
could look like blood so I didn't want
to do that I think with everything in
this one I can make it work hopefully
with makeup in general not for sure but
hopefully fingers crossed I only have
makeup I don't have any like cool
halloween special effects stuff laying
around my house because I would have no
idea what to do with it I don't even
know where you buy that kind of stuff
but I'm going to attempt to make myself
a look at this girl right here so I
don't know we'll see i'll probably do a
voiceover because i have a feeling if i
would try to talk through it not only
talk myself through patak you guys
through to this video could probably be
two hours so i'll probably do a
voiceover and we'll just see how it goes
i have not practiced this look I was
hoping to practice and I just did not
have the time to be able to practice and
so this is going to be my practice in my
video all in one no idea how this is
going to go but we're going to try it
out so I hope that you guys enjoy my
first halloween tutorial please be kind
very first time I'm trying anything like
this but why don't we go ahead and jump
into it I guys jumping into it i'm using
my smashbox photo mat eyes palette i'm
first going to take this like really
deep kind of purple color on my morphe
m4 33 and just one this into the crease
honestly really the only reason I did
this was because I was afraid to just
come in with a black shadow but I'm
gonna
pick up the matte black shadow from the
palette and my morphe g13 and just place
this all over the lid I like this brush
for packing on color but then it also
has the ability to blend as well so I
just make sure that it is blend it into
the crease also I you know was obviously
going to do my eyes first because I was
working with darker shades but look at
my face and look at how there is no
fallout I am just so impressed with this
palette I just still impressed with it
so for a liner I'm going to take my NYC
a liquid eyeliner and create a pretty
bold wing this isn't my favorite
eyeliner because i feel like it can be
kind of hard to get a precise wing but
when i knew i was going to do something
more dramatic and bold i figured it
would be a fine choice and it was the
only thing i say what this liner is be
careful because it takes a while to dry
so don't just like immediately open your
eyes all the way or you'll get transfer
from my lashes i'm using the ardell
double up lashes i really wanted
dramatic lashes with this look as well
and the double ups were the perfect
choice next I'm going to take my it
cosmetics gel waterproof liner I'm going
to line my waterline with this and then
also the lower lash line and then I'm
going to go back and pick up the black
from the palette and also use the liner
side of the double ended brush that
comes with the pilot and just really
smoke out the lower lash line make it
really heavy and black I'm also going to
work on extending the eyeliner line to
give it more of like the feline type of
look and then I'm going to switch to my
face I'm going to use the two-phase
primed and poreless and it's here that I
realized I probably shouldn't have done
my eyeliner yet because I wasn't gonna
be able to do concealer now but I had
something else in mind for the under
eyes so I was like don't panic just keep
it rollin so for my foundation I chose
the maybelline fit me matte and poreless
i'm applying that with a damp Real
Techniques sponge really the only reason
that I chose this foundation is because
it's not a great color match for me it's
a little too yellow but I thought why
not Halloween makeup just you know go in
with something that I know isn't a
favorite of mine type of
and then for my brows I picked up my
benefit goof proof pencil I'm in shade
number two and at first I started to
draw eyebrows like I normally would and
then you see me there that I was like
wait a second this is Halloween what am
i doing I'm trying to be a wolf so I
actually take my pencil here and I make
diagonal marks and really kind of brush
the lashes up and took into the side and
then I spoolie them up and that's where
I want them to be I want them to look
untamed and a little wild and I ended up
having a lot of fun with the brow part
of it because you guys might know i'm
not a big brow pro yet so that was fun
to do then I'm going to work on kind of
shading my face so I'm taking my
physicians formula butter bronzer and
this brush is the blush brush from Real
Techniques and I'm going to do that on
the sides of my face and then also my
forehead I noticed in the picture where
she had the hair place down the areas
were also shaded in so that's why I'm
taking such a big brush and working on
these areas I'm really glad that I
noticed this in the picture because it
was a little hard to see at first but
I'm really glad that I did it because I
thought that it actually did make a
pretty big difference so then I'm going
to pick up the Cameo contour stick from
pierre cosmetics and use the contour
side of it and just start to draw in
hair this is kind of where I have no
idea what I'm doing I've never done
anything like this in my life so I was
like well let's just see how it goes so
I'm just placing this all around my
forehead around the temples and I'm
bringing it all the way down to my
cheeks and if you see me looking down
it's because I'm looking at the photo
for reference and my phone was just
sitting in my lap so that's what I'm
doing around here and just kind of keep
checking myself and what it is that I
look like I realized at the end that I
probably could have brought the hairs
down even farther like on my forehead
and in closer on my cheekbones but hey
first time that's okay so then I pick up
the NYX jumbo pencil in milk to just
create some white hairs along the face
as well so I'm just blending that in
with the brown and then I also do it
above the eyebrows as well because I
noticed she had like some fun hairs on
the eyebrows I don't feel like this
turned out really very good at all but
yeah I gave it a shot
and then I also pick up a flat definer
brush from bhcosmetics and the contour
shade try to place the shadows the
busted again I also use it to contour my
nose same brush same contour powder but
I didn't like how it turned out so i'll
come back to the nose a little bit later
so then i also pick up my NYC liner
again and then i'm just making the black
marks here and you can see when it came
out really smudged i look at the camera
like oh no I just I just screwed it up I
should stop but I was like nope just
keep going you know you don't know what
you're doing anyways just keep trying
make it messy it's no big deal just keep
going with it so I did so I just put the
liner all around my face as well
blending it into the brown and the white
and then I decided to go back into that
Smashbox palette and I using the other
side of the brush that's in there and
I'm just taking a kind of like a cool
tone brown shade and I just start to
color I just wasn't feeling the hair as
much as I thought I was going to and so
I was like you know what now I'm just
going to play around and color and see
what it turns out like at this point I
was like I don't know if things are
going well but I actually ended up
really liking it more once I started
doing this so I do this for quite some
time I add more white i add more black i
come back in with the brown and i just i
ended up really liking the way that it
looked and i also used that same shade
and brush for the nose contour and it
just really brought it out more to me so
i ended up liking this nose contour a
lot more than what i was doing
previously and then you see I just come
back and color guys I colored for a
while and I also i was like further you
know towards the mirror and then I
backed up a little bit too and that was
a tip that I just heard from Jacqueline
hill like look at yourself from
different angles and I thought that
really came in handy here so here I'm
kind of farther away from where my
mirror is and I'm kind of looking at the
mirror I'm looking at the viewfinder
just kind of checking from different
angles what I think it looks like and
then here I wasn't so sure about the
nose I couldn't quite figure out what
she was doing in the photo so I'm just
taking my NYC liner again and drawing
the line on my nose I kind of thought it
made me look like a cat though and even
my husband was like you know the hair
eyes I see and eyebrows he said I see
wearable if he said but for some reason
the nose is reminding me of a cat and I
was like you know what me too so the
nose wasn't perfect but hey you know
gotta have something to work on right
then I'm going to jump into my honest a
severely Hills sweets glow kid and I use
my ELF small tapered brush and I pick up
butterscotch first and place it
underneath my eyes she had some glitter
on her under eyes and I don't have any
glitter so I thought what better for
halloween then to bust out the sweets
pellet and I was planning on just doing
a little bit right underneath the eyes
and I ended up kind of going crazy
because I just started to have so much
fun and what better time than a
halloween makeup look than to just like
go ham on your highlighter I also take a
little bit of marshmallow and I place
that over butterscotch just because just
because I wanted to start to go a little
crazy with the highlight but I really
like the way that it turned out and I
also take some marshmallow and I place
it down the just the bridge of my nose I
don't take it all the way down I just
mostly focus on the bridge of the nose
and I really like the way that that
looked too and then I also dip into
taffy and I place that around the
hairline but at this point I was like
I'm trying not to go too crazy because I
don't want to mess everything up because
I actually finally got the hair to where
I somewhat liked it so I just sprinkled
a little bit of taffy and then I take
marshmallow on a large pencil brush and
I place that in the inner corners and
then I realized that I was losing the
extended eyeliner look so then I had to
go back into the Smashbox palette grab
out the liner brush and make sure I get
the liner back to where I wanted it to
be and then to finish it off I grabbed
beeper from colour-pop I think it's a
great option for Halloween if you don't
have like black or a funky blue or deep
purple Bieber is such a great color and
once i'm done with the lips then this
we're both look is complete hey
everybody and this is the final look
what do you guys think um I'm kind of
like shocked in a good way it came out a
lot better than i expected like I don't
look a ton like the girl on the picture
but I didn't think I would it was just
kind of like my inspiration but I'm
actually really happy with this for my
first time ever doing halloween makeup I
feel like this was a really good start
because there wasn't a lot of like
perfection that needed to go into this
you know like with all of like this hair
going around like I was just kind of
picking up whatever just going with it
was almost like coloring at one point
and then I don't I mean I saw that she
had glitter down here and I was like why
not just put a bunch of highlight on my
face I don't know so I feel like if
you're a beginner as well with halloween
makeup this could be something easy to
start off with so it actually came out a
lot better than I expected and was
smoother than I expected there was
definitely a couple of times where I
like had moments of panic like I did
that wrong or that looks messed up but I
kept it rollin and you know why I'm
really glad that I did I'm really proud
of myself that I've made this video to
because I was so uncomfortable going
into it I was like this is just going to
be such a mess but I'm really really
glad that I did it so I wanted to really
encourage you guys like feel free to
step outside of your comfort zone if
there's something you've done and I mean
it doesn't even have to be halloween
makeup our makeup in general but if
there's something out there that you've
like never really had the courage to go
after like just go ahead and do it
because I was 90% sure I was not going
to film a halloween tutorial at all I'm
really glad that I decided to do it and
thank you guys for pushing me so much
and for constantly saying that I should
do it and I should try I just I
appreciate it so much I had a lot of fun
filming this I'm actually really happy
what that this could be a really easy
like fun even look like you're going to
a Halloween party and you don't really
have a costume we just put together like
a werewolf face and there you go again I
used only makeup products I will leave
everything a link down below that I used
I didn't have any sort of like special
effects anything or halloween makeup or
anything like that everything that I
used is a makeup product or like a
makeup brush even so yeah I'm really
excited I didn't have to buy any new
products for this everything was what I
had at home and I'm just I'm really glad
I'm excited I was able to get this in
for you guys I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this tutorial or maybe you'll
learn something
you want to try it out if you do
recreate it let me know because I would
love to see that but thank you again for
the encouragement and the motivation to
get this halloween tutorial done because
now i'm really really happy that i did
i'm actually really sad that i don't
have anywhere to go in this makeup
because i kind of think like that it's
really fun so i just have to go wash it
off now and take a shower which is kind
of a bummer but thank you guys so much
for watching I appreciate it so much
thank you for being on the journey with
me to creating my first halloween makeup
look ever and to do it on camera and for
youtube video for the very first time

made it through we did it and thank you
so much i hope you will give this video
