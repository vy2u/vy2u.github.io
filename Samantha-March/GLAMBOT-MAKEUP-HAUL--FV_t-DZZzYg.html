excited for today's video it's going to
be a new a makeup haul and I'm going to
be sharing all the items that I recently
got from the website glambot this video
is sponsored at bike alia Bhatt's so a
huge thank you to them for working with
me on this video and thank you to you
guys for supporting me and letting me
have these types of opportunities
because I have been eyeing a glam pot
for a while I was seeing some YouTube
videos about the website and I was like
wait a second I think I need you check
this out so I am so excited to share
with you about glambot what it's about
how it works and then of course I show
you everything that I got the new makeup
goodies that I have added to my
collection so if you are ready to see my
haul and learn some more about glambot
why don't we go ahead and get started
well glambot is a discount and makeup
site and basically you can go on and you
can find there is a ton a ton of
different brands on there there is new
makeup there's older makeup there's
limited-edition makeup makeup that was
limited-edition that's no longer around
anymore I mean they have a little bit of
everything I from really huge name-brand
companies out there like I have makeup
here from Tarte and from Oprah from
Becca cosmetics hourglass like I'm so
excited to show you guys what I got but
they have so many different brands in
there and then also so one part that I
think is really interesting that you can
go and buy the discount and makeup on
there but the other part that I found is
really interesting and another reason
why I really wanted to work with glambot
is because you can also sell your makeup
to glambot and if you guys don't know I
recently started doing a blog sale I
also recently start at a Poshmark
account and when I'm doing my the
clutters if there are certain items that
I can sell like the ones that you know
obviously it's not like an empty
foundation bottle or things like that or
eyelashes or something kind of creepy
like that I will put it on my blog sale
or I'll put it on my Poshmark account so
when I found that you can actually sell
your gently used makeup on this website
- I was like now I'm very interested
please keep talking to me so you can
kind of have it both ways so I would
definitely check that out if you're
someone who is into the discounted
makeup or if you're someone who I know
from starting my blog sale and doing the
Poshmark I know there's a lot of people
that are still just as interested in
purchasing you know discounted makeup
even though it has been used but it's
in really good shape and really good
condition and then you can still get
that product try it have in your
collection and you've also saved money
but then also at the same time if you're
someone like me who does you know have a
huge makeup collection and every once in
a while you have to go through and
declutter it and you're looking for
places to sell you can check out glambot
for that too I thought that was pretty
cool so of course it will be a link down
below and if you're someone who is
interested in purchasing items there
there will also be a 30% discount code
that I will have in the description box
too that will be for new users so if you
want to use that one you can use that on
your order
I mean I've noticed from the glambot
site as well like sometimes they have
certain pop-ups that come up because
I've been I've been trolled in that site
for good some time now I've been on the
site many different times and you know
the box will pop up for like a ten
dollar credit or an extra 10% off things
like that did say one of the best ways
to get alerted for when you know new big
sales come around or new like hot items
get added to the website too is to join
their newsletter be doing an email sent
to you letting you know so you don't
miss items as well so that is a little
bit about a glam pot and I hope that you
guys are excited to hear about that
because I was really pumped I didn't
know about this website until I saw
other youtubers starting to talk about
it I was like excuse me what so let me
know in the comments down below for sure
if you are already familiar with the
site if you've bought from them if
you've sold to them let us know your
experience because I would love to know
as well but I want to show you what I
got because I'm excited for these new
goodies so first up I got some newest
single shadows and from makeup geek I
love makeup geek eyeshadows I have a ton
I don't know how many I have I mean
definitely not as many as some other
people because I probably have maybe
around 20 and I know other people have
like huge giant sea pellets full of
makeup geek but when I saw they had the
makeup geek single shadows on there I
was like there are some shades that I
have always wanted and it came really
nice each one is separately packaged and
you know like really nicely packaged
really secure I'll show you the
lipsticks too because I did get a couple
lipsticks wait but I did and everything
like I was very impressed with I'm just
kind of how everything looked how
everything was packaged you could tell
there was a lot of care put into them so
this first shade is called I'm a peach
list and it's just a really pretty
peachy eyeshadow and then
next one is mango tango I have almost
purchased mango tangos so many times and
I haven't done it and now I finally got
me a sell mango tango so I'll go ahead
and swatch both of these and these I
mean I can tell that they've been used
but they don't look like in really bad
condition there's not like deep dense in
either of these so I was really
impressed about that and so here is what
these look like they're is I'm peach
list and then Mango Tango and then there
are those 2a swatched on my hand and
then I got both of these for $5.25 I
believe it was but they were also having
the sale on my cupcake so it's actually
buy one get one half off so that's
awesome because these are originally as
$6 so you got one for a little bit
cheaper and then one for even more
cheaper which I thought was pretty
awesome so I got some new makeup geek a
single shadows to add to my collection
but next time I saw that there was some
a Tarte rainforest of the sea lipsticks
on there and I was like yeah I'm gonna
have to do that I did notice some items
that come like where you can actually
like take the cap off they did come up
with this little GP sticker on it and
then the sticker actually you know came
over the cap so I did kind of have to
remove that a bit to remove the cap and
then I wanted to show you what the
ellipse tick will look like so this is
what it looked like when I got it so you
can tell that it has been you know
sanitized and cared for and this looked
like a brand new lipstick to me so I was
really impressed when I opened
especially the lipsticks and saw that I
thought that was pretty awesome but I
love these Tarte rainforest of the seal
lipsticks I own I think 3 different
shades and you guys might laugh but I
did this I got this in rum punch you do
own the mini of the rum punch it came in
one of my Sephora says but I use that
lipstick so much it is always in my
collector I'm always reaching for it
when I go out and even on nights out if
I start out with a liquid lipstick by
the end of the night I'm typically going
in for a rum punch and putting it on
it's getting down there I honestly think
I'm gonna go through it which is like
shocking to me it was like I'm real mini
mini
in that set but when I saw that rum
punch and the full-size was on there I
was like I have to do it I have to do I
love this lipstick so much I had to do
it so I got me
full-size of a rum punch from tart
because I am so clearly obsessed with
this shade I got it for $18 and it does
a retail for $21 a soap bit of a
discount I got my favorite lipstick in a
full-size ha very happy about that so we
also know how much I love bronzers and
so when I saw this bronzer I was like I
think I need to get that one this is a
from Oprah again I hit the little
sticker over the clasp here and this is
the americano a bronzer I have been
wanting to try more from Oprah I just
recently started trying out the brand
this year I love their liquid lipsticks
I love their highlighters and want to be
trying more from them so when I saw the
bronzer on there I was like I love
brothers let's go ahead and give this a
try so again this is the americano
bronzer so I am excited to get this onto
my face so there is what that one it
looks like a swatch tout I notice that
it does have some shimmer to it so we'll
have to see how well I don't always go
for shimmer bronzers but we'll have to
see what we think of it the Ofra
bronzers run for $35 on the Ophir
website and I got this one
for $31 and it barely looks like it was
touched like there's a little bit like I
can see in the middle but then all the
way around it it looks like it hasn't
been used at all and one thing about big
line about website that I noticed is
that what you look at it it'll tell you
what condition it's in and then it will
also tell you like the fill which i
think is really interesting it has a
hundred percent eighty percent and then
I can't remember what else and then it
goes down so you know how much product
you are getting so you're aware of that
but then also you can decide you know
okay so is that discount worth what like
what how much product is left so I think
that's really cool that they have that
added to their website but that's
another item I got the over bronzer so I
saw hourglass on there and I was like
I'm just gonna go ahead and go for it so
I got an hourglass blush these are $38
originally and I got it for $30 so I
didn't think that was bad at all this
better than the 38 but I feel like I
hear so many people saying really good
things about these and the only items
that I really
try our like samples like like the
sample cards so I was like let's just go
for it and it's beautiful like to me I
feel like you can to tell on this one at
all and it's even been used like it
looks in fabulous condition I didn't
even realize that there was a little
mirror there so this one is in ethereal
glow okay so there is a swatch of that
and when i swatched in such an awkward
spot but there is what a serial glow
looks like so it's a really pale pink
I'm excited I'm excited to have some
hourglass when I saw it I was like I'm
just gonna go ahead and do it get a bit
of a discount don't feel as bad so that
is what I did so I now own an hourglass
blush I did get another blush this one
is a from Becca cosmetics this one is in
a flower child it's one of the mineral
blushes so these are $32 I believe and I
got mine for 28 so this is what the
little blush looks like again it comes
with a mirror and this one again is in a
flower child so there is what a flower
child looks like from Becca I do have a
couple of Becca blushes from the
palettes that I own and I've always been
really impressed with them and I know a
lot of people really talk up the Becca
blushes there that one is right there in
flower child so when I saw it again I
was like I don't want to do it so God
will discount on the Becca blush I'm
excited to have another one in my
collection so we've added a Bellflower
child in the final item that I have here
is from Anasazi Beverly Hills this is
another one of her matte lipsticks and I
got my shade in buff now I do own one of
her matte lipsticks and I just had not
really made my mind up about it and I
was like maybe it's because I got a
darker color I should get a nude I've
had a nude in my Ulta cart for the
longest time and I like just do it
just buy it but then when I saw it on
glambot I was like alright I'm gonna get
it so these are $18 originally and I got
412 again this one is in the shade of
buff so I thought it was a really nice
nude and again if you can see they're
from the lipstick the way that it comes
it looks like a brand new lipstick which
i think is pretty awesome so again this
one is in the shade buff ooh that's
pretty
so there is what buff from Anasazi looks
like I'm excited to give another lips
like a try and see what I think about it
so I don't know their lipstick I know I
had to do a tulip size I just had to you
guys no one should be surprised at that
but added another av age a lipstick it's
my collection I guess so that is
everything that I picked up in my clan
bot hall I hope that you guys enjoyed
