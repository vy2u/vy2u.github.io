going to be doing an eye makeup tutorial
on this butter kind of like halo glitter
I look what I'm really excited about it
because I actually did this look a while
ago and I had it on snapchat and on
instagram I got a few requests to do it
and then i got like scared of the
glitter if you guys watch my fab our
failed drug store edition I talked about
these wet'n'wild glitters and I actually
used one today on my eyes i purchased
two different one wild glitters one was
bomb one was terrible and then I was so
afraid I was gonna like use the good one
again and it was just like somehow gonna
go wrong and so I've been like so scared
to do it but I was like no you know what
people wanted to see that love glitters
really like popping right now so I was
like let's just try out a glitter luck
and it went well so that is good and
every an eye makeup look I do apply mile
up in the video as well but my face and
everything is already done but I do have
like a foundation routine video I also
have like a highlight contour baking
video I have an eyelash video so I mean

separate videos I can leave them linked

alright guys and this is the finished
look I really hope that you guys liked
it it's a pretty simple look I mean the
glitter makes it easy if you kind of
like take your halos too far somewhere
the glitter can kind of help make up for
it shouldn't be a scary look I'm still
very new with like makeup and doing
different looks with makeup and I can
still kind of get scared of it but this
is one that after the first time I did
it I was like that really was not that
bad and I just think it's fun glitter is
such a fun way to kind of like spice up
your makeup looks a little bit and I
just I'm really been loving it the wet
and wild glitter is super super
inexpensive and like you saw it applied
easily I don't have glitter all over my
face and I just think it lasts for in a
long time so all the products that I've
