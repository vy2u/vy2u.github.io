back today with a new makeup tutorial
I'm so excited this is my second makeup
tutorial that I'm posting on YouTube
since I stopped posting them like last
winter I really did appreciate all the
love on the makeup tutorial that I
posted a couple weeks ago and a lot of
you guys said you wanted to see more
from me so here we are with another one
I don't really know what I'm going to
call this one for sure it's kind of like
my go-to summer look but it's still kind
of glam at the same time I basically
have like two things that I'm doing
summer wise and that's either a really
bold eye shadow on the lid or a more
neutral lid and a bolder shadow on the
lower lash line and that is what I did
today
I'm using mostly makeup geek products
that were sent to me I did a PAPR haul a
couple months ago and I showed a big
package that make any extent to me so
that is what I'm using in today's video
but I'm excited to show you this like I
said I get a little bit nervous loosing
makeup tutorials because I'm not a
makeup artist so I don't know if I'm the
best at teaching makeup but I did listen
to a lot of your comments and you know
you guys still seem to like my makeup
looks I get asked for tutorials a ton
and one thing that I'll say about my
makeup looks is that I truly do think
that they're super simple it's two
eyeshadows on my lids it's you know
sometimes you can just incorporate the
color in here and there and it can make
it look a little bit bolder or maybe
even more complicated than it really
needs to be but I hope that you guys
like it it is a full face tutorial the
lips turned out a little bit not quite
when I expected it but other than that
it is a full face makeup tutorial so I
hope that you guys will like it if you
are new to my channel welcome and thank
you for clicking on this video right now
I am posting a video every single day so
if you do enjoy daily content all about
makeup and beauty a lot of product
reviews a lot of chat about makeup I
hope that you will consider hitting the
subscribe button before you leave my
20kg boy is going on right now both here
on YouTube and also over on my Instagram
page I have a 20k giveaway going on over
there as well and there is some makeup
geek included in that so I will have a
links to both of those down below but if
you would like to see how I got this
summer glam makeup look please keep
watching so starting off I do have my
eyelids primed already with my ELF
primer that I was talking about my
makeup monthly that I love
then I'm just going to go ahead and set
the primer and I'm going to use a Peach
Smoothie from a makeup geek and I'm just
using a Real Techniques deluxe concealer
brush and I'm just going to place those
all over the lid
I'm going to use be shade unexpected
it's a really pretty like light lavender
normally I would go in into my crease
with like a brown but I just have been
liking mixing it up a little bit here
and there I'm going to use my Sigma e-40
brush it's just a really big fluffy
crease brush it's going to blend this
into the crease be really nice and
sloppy with it it just gives a nice of
washes color without being too
overwhelming but I kind of like that
it's just a little bit different from
the regular Brown that I'm always using
so I've actually really been enjoying
this color and it's been popping it in
here and there and my makeup looks so
next I'm going to take the shade
grandstand which is definitely the star
of the show
it's the foiled shadow from makeup geek
I'm just going to apply this all over
the lid am I going to use my Sigma
medium sweeper brush the e54 to apply
this all over the lid and then I am also
going through my brush with a little bit
of mac's fix+ because I thought it
helped make the shadow more metallic
again I'm just applying this all over
the lid this is definitely the star of
the show and I think it is so gorgeous I
was hearing rave reviews about this
shadow and I get why and if you're like
sloppy like I own like up in here that's
okay because we can fix that going to go
back in with my e-40 and just kind of
blend everything together
and again you can kind of fix up any
mistakes if any of the shadows went too
far you can clean that up in this
process really like the light purple and
I like these two together I've never
tried these two together but I like how
they look and I just think it's just
something so slightly different than the
usual Brown but I've been having a lot
of fun playing with different colors
recently so in kind of my go-to looks I
have not been using a lot of liner you
probably notice in my videos I don't
have a lot of winged liner I've just
been doing lashes you of course don't
have to do lashes I mean you've also
seen in my videos that sometimes I'm
foregoing the lashes and of just doing
mascara but I just love lashes I mean I
just
I've been wearing them for years and I
love them so much so for me myself I'm
going to skip liner and add a nice pair
of lashes but remember you do you the
lashes I'm going to apply our pure
lashes and they are in the style
bombshell and love pure lashes I'm
recommending them all the time so I'm
going to pop these on and then we're
going to go ahead and jump into the base
so after my lashes are on then I start
to work on the face this is normally my
everyday process a little bit of eyes
then face then eyes this is face but I'm
going to use my number 7 airbrush a
white primer this is just like my
favorite primer right now I can't stop
using it I think it's really nice if it
feels really smooth and almost like
hydrating on the face but then it's
still that like sticky tacky feeling on
the face and you feel like your makeup
is just actually sticking to it so I
have been loving this primer my
foundation I'm going to go into my Tarte
rainforest of the sea foundation I'm in
the shade light/medium honey again I've
been loving this foundation and I know
the day they are filming I have planned
tonight I'm gonna be out for a while so
I want a good like long wear foundation
and I think this is it and I'm going to
be using my cute little Beauty sponge
that I got from SL miss Caleb how
adorable is that I'm going to be using a
bunch of her brushes too which I'm
excited about but i used the beauty
sponge the other day and i actually
thought it was really really good like
beauty sponges can be pretty hit or miss
for me but i really liked this one so
much that i'm going to use it again
business squeeze some foundation on here
I swear the worst part of this
foundation is just like squeeze tube
thing especially when you have your
hands like kind of slippery from primer
it can be so hard to get that thing to
give you some foundation so I'm going to
pounce those all into my face but yes
like I said I like this sponge I think
it got really big Wayne wet and I like
this little curve on the side I don't
know if you'll be able to see how it
kind of has just that little and it's
just on that side like when I first
looked at the sponge I actually didn't
know because some sponges it's like the
whole one side is that kind of slope but
this is just right at the tip of it and
I actually really liked that feature
about it I got super excited to try this
I didn't even actually know if I knew
that she had a beauty sponge obviously I
know about her makeup brushes so it just
makes sense that she has a sponge too
but man like she isn't pressing me I
used her brushes the other day too and
I'm going to be featuring some in this
tutorial as well but yeah pretty awesome
concealer I'm going to use the Tarte
rainforest of the sea concealer as well
again just like the foundation it's an
aqua concealer so I just feel like it's
a little bit more light and breathable
on the skin but I still think it has
good coverage I'm going to play that
underneath my eyes and then to the
center of my face very lightly I don't
go real crazy with it most days focusing
most on the under eyes and then I'm
going to take the sponge on that kind of
taper side then just go ahead and blend
all that out I don't bake a ton but
since I know like I said I'm going to be
Alex kind of later tonight I am going to
bake just to keep everything in place
I'm going to use the Tarte smooth
operator Amazonian clay finishing powder
to set my under eye concealer and I'm
going to use the same Beauty sponge and
I'm going to use the same like tapered
tip side and just pick up a little bit
of powder and apply this on right
underneath my eyes I'm just going to do
my under eye area I know some people
kind of will set their whole whole face
but I really am NOT one who needs that
and I don't have a problem really with
this foundation going anywhere so I'm
just going to do my under eyes I really
like the sponge too for the baking
purposes as well it's really good I'm so
excited that I bought another sponge
that I love so so awesome let's leave
this fit for probably no more than five
minutes I would say maybe like two
minutes
and then I'm going to use my Sigma s 25
to just dust that away and I'm just
going to go right into bronzing I'm not
going to do like cream contour or
anything like that today I've kind of
been skipping that step everyone well
and it's either like I do a cream
contour and I don't runs as much or I do
broad and I don't cream contour so today
we're just going to do a little bit of
bronzing I'm going to go into the
to play play palette because I love the
brother in here and I keep reaching for
it I use the shade Terra Cotta here on
the end and I'm going to use the expert
space t10 brush from SL miss glam I
believe she said in her favorite brushes
videos that she likes to use this one
for broad there too because it has a
little bit more of like a dead flat
shape to it that can be good for
bronzing and I'm just going to brown
this Too Faced a little bit even though
I really don't need it a ton because I
have been outside a lot lately and it
doesn't do no matter how much SPF I'm
loading on my face I can tell I'm still
getting a tan so just gonna split the
bronze up here and it's funny too
because I really like the Terracotta for
a bronze shade and I like desert which
is the middle shade in this palette I
like it for a contour when I am
contouring my face but I swear that I
reach with this palette more for the
contour bronzer shades than I do for the
eyeshadows which is really funny it
doesn't shock me honestly like it
doesn't shock me because I love bronzing
and contouring and all that bronze a
little bit on the forehead as well I
really do like this brush or brush so so
soft all the brushes I'm using are from
the teal glam brush book which I was so
excited she said to me if you watch my
PR Hall Show Devery thing that she sent
to me and it was like the craziest thing
ever like this whole glam brush book is
so nice I used too much of the eye
brushes the other day and now I'm
working with the face brushes and they
are really really nice brushes and
they're so pretty like look at this
pretty handle with the jewels and I love
the teal color so super cool we after
bronzer I'm going to pop off camera and
do my eyebrows and I'll be back to work
on the item or let my brows are done I'm
going to finish off the eyes I'm going
to use a for my waterline the pier on
point eyeliner but using this a lot
lately is in the shade down to earth
which is a
nice Brown that I really enjoy I'm just
going to add this to the water line
because I said I like a pop on the lower
lash line when I do more of a neutral
look on the lid I'm going to take some
of this plot twist and from makeup geek
and apply it to my lower lash line
really gorgeous like purple foiled
shades and I'm going to use my Sigma e30
six I thought this shade was fun because
it's a pretty purple like a purple blue
iridescent and I just think it looks
really cool especially on the lower lash
line and someone asked in other days I
would do purple on my lower lash line so
I have blue in a video and they said
they want to staple so here we go then
I'm going to use the shade whimsical for
a inner corner and brow bone highlight I
use this in my makeup makeup step
roulette and I absolutely loved it I'm
going to use my morphe e18 and you
supply some to the brow bone and then
inner corner chop the eyes I'm just
going to add a little bit of the julep
with a twist mascara to my bottom lashes
the either done I'm going to finish off
the face I'm going to use this pixie
blush in a collaboration with Aspen over
it is in realm rose they really pretty
peachy I want something what's a glow in
it as well and I have like a nice glow
sparkle to it and then I'm going to use
the SL miss glam classic powder
po1 brush to apply it I like this blush
civilities gives a nice blush to the
cheeks and like I said it is below E as
well but it's never like too
overwhelming because sometimes I look at
it and think it's too dark for my skin's
and it's like no matter how much you
apply it's just not overwhelming which I
enjoy for highlight I'm going to be
using the Kevin a Quan the Neill
highlighter in Sahara for a golden rose
glow CSL glam to6 tapered blush of the
table blush or at least good Frost I
like and I'm just going to mostly focus
on this lighter side and
see what kind of glow we get uh is
really pretty I was so impressed - I use
his um contour and highlight sculpting
book the other day and the highlight was
so intense again I'm just focusing on
this half of the palate for this makeup
look I didn't want to go too deep into
the darker side but it's really really a
pretty highlight all of these brushes -
from SMS glam have totally been
impressing me like I said they were from
the glam brush book and she was so sweet
when she sent me a package she included
some discount codes so those will be in
the description box down below but she
gave me one for 40% off the brush books
which i think is just freakin amazing so
if you use the close
Sam March you'll get the 40% off the
brush books which I just think is gone
and that's just a discount code for you
guys it's not an affiliate code look
highlight this so bruton and then finish
it off with my lip color I'm going to
use a makeup geek lipstick that they
sent me is one of their iconic lipsticks
and it is in the shade candid actually
darker than I thought it was going to be
I thought I remember when i swatched it
it was like a lot lighter so I'm going
to put a little bit of a mac lipglass
on top and this is in the shade mist
just because I didn't really want and
this I was going for more of like a
nerds look so I'm just going to put a
little bit of it on top and see what it
looks like but still it's not totally
the shade that I was expecting for my
lip color but I like it a lot better and
I have been doing some glosses more here
and there so I kind of like the effect
that it gives so lip combo make a peak
in mascaras in divisional up I'm going
to spray my face with a little bit of
the number seven hydrating mist to bring
some hydration to the face and then help
it stay in place
okay so that is going to do it for my go
to a summer glam makeup look I really
