is going to be a valentines day makeup
tutorial on this look right here I do
need to warn you this video is like whoa
I'm just getting over an injury and I
thought maybe it would still be an okay
day to film and it was like not only am
i injured I have like a pinched nerve in
my neck which is causing me like all
kinds of problems but it's just like one
of those days we're like you know
something's wrong and maybe you should
be filming and then you decide to film
anyways and then like everything in the
world goes wrong but you can just see
that in the video so proceed with
caution but I didn't want to get a
valentines day makeup tutorial out for
you guys this is a look using the morphe
35o palette I actually shared a picture
probably like last month on Instagram
and someone asked for a makeup tutorial
on it and immediately in my mind I kind
of thought it might be a good one for
Valentine's Day it's kind of like a
softer look but still glamorous and we
got the gold and I got some like purples
and mobs topes and all that good stuff
in there but you also i thought it would
just be a really good one for
valentine's day so that is what i
decided to film for you guys today i
would do want to say thank you for all
the love I'm like my Instagram and my
snapchat since I got hurt I really do
appreciate seeing those come in they
just make me feel so much better and
like I'm going to be healed in no time
at all I got so many people backing me
up so thank you so much for that I
really can't tell you how much I
appreciate it I am NOT someone who likes
to lay in bed all day and it's been very
frustrating it the day I'm filming is
like the first day i'm actually getting
up and doing most of my moving around
and it's just been a very tough couple
of days not being able to get up that's
not my style but if you guys would like
to see I makeup tutorial on this
Valentine's Day look right here please
keep watching jumping in with the morphe
35t palette and these two top shades
it's like a light brown a light taupe
and putting those in my crease with a
fluffy blending brush from bhcosmetics I
did prime my eyes with the
the air patrol primer also then using
this a really pretty taupe shade on my
Sigma e25 blending brush you'll see when
you pat it into my outer V and then
slowly start to work it in to the inner
part of my eye I do this a couple of
times and then coming in with this gold
shade on a flat shader brush from BH
Cosmetics and just running this all over
my eyelid I do want to focus this mostly
on the inner part of the eyes and then
again with my Sigma e25 brush and a
little bit more of that taupe shade I'm
just going to kind of deep enough that
crease again cuz it's a little lost with
the gold and then coming in with this
little darker taupe shade from the
pallid and a more pg-13 brush you'll see
me again Pat it on the outer V and just
a little bit of drag it into the inner
part but mostly just darkening that
outer V and then coming back with my
sigma brush no extra product this time
I'm just blending everything together
making sure there's no harsh lines
and then I'll put a little bit more gold
dark there just because I want the gold
to really be the start and it can get
lost when you blend for eyeliner I'm
going to use the Knicks trays you'll a
liner in black on my waterline and then
mix those two soap shades one on a flat
definer brush and one on a big pencil
brush both from bhcosmetics those on my
lower lash line for mascara i use the
tart lights camera flashes and for my
eyeliner i did use the NYC liquid liner
and lashes are the ardell natural
wispies but let me tell you I can't do
that on camera that was not pretty for
primer I used the Make Up For Ever
smoothing primer and then I'm coming in
with a new l'oreal cushion foundation
and pushing this on with a damp Beauty
Blender i have found it's my favorite
way to apply this foundation and I am
shade and 3.5
I'm going to set the foundation with the
maybelline fit me powder and just a
fluffy powder brush from bhcosmetics
for concealers I'm going to mix 2 i'm
gonna mix the Maybelline instant age
rewind and also the Maybelline better
skin concealer because I've been sick
and injured and my dark circles are a
little out of control I'm going to buff
that in with the more fiji to brush this
is like my favorite brush for this
favorite I'm going to do a little baking
here I don't do a whole lot but i'm
using the laura mercier secret
brightening powder and a small tapered
brush from ELF to apply that on there to
start the baking process while that
bakes I'm going to contour with a new
wet'n'wild contour palette and an angled
brush from bhcosmetics I'm the worst of
putting my hair back before i start
tutorials be worse
and I'm going to dust away the secret
brightening powder I like to bake
because i think the instant for the
better skin concealer i think it creases
just a little bit so I like to bake when
I use that concealer for blush I'm using
the color pop in between the sheets and
applying that with my more p.m. 427
brush this is a great brush for the
colour-pop blushes this is a real
techniques blush brush but I use it as a
blending brush and just kind of blend
everything together for the final
touches i'm taking a light gold shade
it's right next to the one and the
morphe 35 t palette that I used on my
eyelid it's just a lighter gold placing
that into my inner corners and then also
as I brow bone highlight with just a
small little brush from BH and coming in
with a smallest concealer brush from ELF
and for my highlighter i'm using
champagne pop from becca cosmetics and
jacqueline pill and just just applying
this just just everywhere that I feel
like highlighter needs to go you know he
doesn't love to shine and I'll can say
for lips I I wanted two eyes to be the
star of the show so I didn't want to use
like a red or bright pink so I went in
with this shade it's midi from
colour-pop it's rather ultra matte with
the lipstick they really pretty like
frosted I see pink so one of my
favorites from them I wear a lot but I
thought it complemented this look very
well so i'm just applying this all over
my lips and then my look is complete is
the final result i really hope you guys
liked this makeup tutorial if you did

thumbs up i love to see the thumbs-up
from you guys come in and all the sweet
comments it's like one of my favorite
parts of the day i usually usually set a

practically I don't know why I do that
and then the next morning it's almost
like Christmas because I come downstairs

don't know maybe that's why I do it you

money or any questions on anything that
I did please you just comment below and
let me know i'm going to try so hard to
