today's video is going to be a day to
night makeup look I wanted to do this
video because I do this really really
often because I do upload a video almost
every single day it means I film almost
every single day
but there's definitely days where I will
not have time to film so I like to film
two videos in one day but I'm really
strange and I like to have different
makeup looks it's just something that I
prefer so a lot of times I will do like
a daytime makeup look I will film a
video and then I will come in and kind
of amp up my look maybe add some lashes
do a different lip color things like
that and then I will film a second video
so there's a little bit about me
so I thought it would make for a fun
idea to do a day to night makeup a style
of video so that's going to be doing
today I'm gonna walk you through how I
get just a really easy quick makeup look
that's perfect for daytime it may be a
work look and then I will come back and
show you how I kind of amp it up a
little bit and make it into a nighttime
look I'm also gonna do hair and outfit
in this video as well I did that in my
last get ready with me and I got really
good feedback which was pretty exciting
for me cuz I wasn't sure so I'm gonna do
that again and do my hair here on camera
and then also my outfit and show kind of
like a going out outfit with my
nighttime makeup look the hair portion
of this video is going to be sponsored
by verb which has me really excited I
have been trying out their seat texture
spray for the past couple of weeks here
and I'm really excited to chat more
about it in to let you know how I use it
in my hair care routine and how it's
been helping me out so I will chat more
about this when we get into the hair
portion of this video so big thank you
to her for sponsoring a portion of this
video but if you would like to see how I
get my daytime at makeup look why don't
we go ahead and get started
alrighty so for my daytime look because
the eyes are very simple I actually like
to start with my face first if I'm using
a lot of shadows dark shadows a lot of
shimmers or glitters and things like
that I'll do my eyes first that way I
can wipe away any fallout on my face but
because the shadows are gonna be so
minimal I prefer to start with my face
so for my primary I'm gonna use this one
from flower beauty and it's the in your
prime and this is the pore minimizing a
primer I also really enjoyed the
hydrating one this is what it looks like
so I like the way it smooths everything
out on the skin so that's I'm going to
use today for my found a
I'm gonna take the number seven stay
perfect foundation this one is in cool
beige I'm just gonna put a few pumps
here onto my morphe sponge I do like
this one because I feel like it's a
pretty long lasting foundation so when I
am doing a date tonight I know that this
one is still going to look good
the only thing about this one and I
mentioned it in my March Madness series
is that I feel like I can get a little
bit shiny towards the end of the day but
it's a reason also why I don't mind
doing this one for day to night looks
because when I come in with a night look
I almost always will powder my face just
to kind of give me like a little Jewish
and what not so I don't mind reaching
for this one because I typically would
powder anyways concealer I'm going to
use the Catrice a liquid a camouflage
concealer and I'm in the shade light
beige and this is one where I was
talking about it in my overlooked makeup
video that days that I'm doing a more
simple look where I am starting out with
the face I will use my concealer as my
eye primer versus like a traditional
eyeshadow primer so I'm just gonna add
some to my eyelids as well and then I
have a little bit of redness on my chin
so I'm also going to apply it to my chin
then I just take the sponge and blend
this one out as well and then I'll just
make sure it's blended out on the eyelid
also and then that way it just cuts out
an extra product as well and to set the
concealer I'm going to use the wet and
wild contour pellet and I have dulce de
leche and this is the morphe 49 this is
my favorite brush right now to set
powder on my under eyes I first kind of
tap it in right on the top of the brush
there on that point and I press it
really closely to the lash line put it
back in and hit it on the side and then
I'll just come in and Pat it underneath
my eyes as well now I'm going to take
that same a wet and wild palette to
contour and I'm going to use this elf
brush from the beautifully precise line
this is the I will tell you
1:04 brush this will take that brush
can put the product right along the
cheekbone and I will slowly start to
push that contour up for my contour I
never really worry if it doesn't look
super blended out right away because
then I come in with the bronzer and it
helps kind of blend everything together
so I'm kind of a contour looks crazy for
a hot minute but that's okay
and then for bronzer I'm gonna reach
into this elf face duo this is in Saint
Lucia and I'm going to use the bronzer
on here and I'm going to use the morphe
R to what helps blend the contour in as
well and I always just make sure with
bronzing as well that I'm focusing on
having the product further up and set it
down just like with contour and then I
will also bronze the forehead and then I
also like to take it the bronzer along
my jaw line and a little bit onto the
neck as well just to make sure the thing
is all matched looking good and I just
really like to be bronzed because you
know it's February in Iowa which means
it means it's not nice for my blush I
finally picked up one of the flower
Beauty blushes I've been wanting this
for a while this is the flower pots
powder blush and peach Primrose is the
one that I got so I'm going to use this
for my blush this is very pigmented I've
been using it the past couple days this
is the Sigma f40 and yeah this blush is
a this was no joke but it's a beautiful
peach color we actually had a new Ulta
open up by us and I got an email about
like they were having a grand opening
and so we're running errands one morning
and we were running errands right by the
Ulta I was like can we just stop in and
see and so we stopped in and we were one
of the first 100 people or something so
they let us both me and Mitch pick out
of the basket and we each got five
dollars off a $10 purchase or something
like that Mitch was like I get to pick
two she's like yeah go ahead pick you
can just you know give it to your wife I
was like okay cool so like I did you
like two separate purchases or whatever
but I ended up getting this so this is
like a $10 blush it's very expensive for
a blush from a drugstore side of Ulta
but I ended up getting it for $5.00 with
the coupon which was pretty cool so but
they're my brows on camera the past
couple of times I've done videos but I'm
gonna go ahead and do that because my
camera is about to overheat so I'm gonna
let it cool down for a bit and since we
have so much to get through I'll just go
ahead and do those off-camera but I'm
gonna use the maybelline eyebrow definer
because I think it's really quite simple
and easy so that's gonna be using a
former brows and I'll be right back okay
so we have a pretty good base down we
have our eyebrows I'm gonna move on to
eyeshadow and this is going to be really
really simple I wanted to use the dose
of colors baked Browns palette mostly
because I love the dose of colors
eyeshadow palettes but this one I think
is just great for date tonight because
you can start off really simple and then
build it up I actually did a day to
night makeup look on Saturday of this
past week and this is the exact palette
that I used to achieve that so that's
what I use today I'm gonna do first
let's just take this first white shade
here and then I like the brush that
comes in these pallets I keep them
around so I'm just going to take that
shade and run it all over my eyelid and
then all the way up to the brow bone to
set the concealer so our shadows have
something to lay nicely on I'm just
gonna go right down the line and pick up
the second brown shade and I'm gonna use
my Dell iam tools blending brush and I'm
just going in to blend that into the
crease I'm going to just be really
sloppy with this get it on the eyelid
gonna keep that brush this is run one
brush kind of look I'm gonna grab the
second shade and I'm just gonna do the
exact same thing I'm just gonna add a
little bit of dimension to the eye look
you can totally do one shade I mean I've
done that before these shadows blend so
easily
I mean this is not taking me any time at
all to do my eyeshadow looks because
these just blend so quickly they're very
pigmented you will get a lot of kick up
in the palette but don't be alarmed I
don't have any fallout on my face like
again I knew that I was going to use
this palette of course and that's
another reason why I didn't mind doing
my face first because I do not get
fallout on to my face and it's just so
it's so fast I mean it looks like you
took a lot of time blending but with the
dose of color of shadows you really
don't need that it's so fast to put
areas to sleep and she's just snoring
snoring beside me fort liner on my
waterline I'm gonna use my Rimmel in the
nude exaggerated liner I was talking
about this liner in my overlooked makeup
products that it's one of my favorite
kind of nude beige liners for the
waterline and then for the lower lash
line I'm just going to mix with those
two shadows that we used on the lid I'm
again going to use the brush that came
with this palette so I'm just going to
do the same thing and sweep this on the
lower lash line and then the same thing
with the second color now for mascara
I'm going to use the pure big look
mascara one of my favorite mascaras one
of my favorite products from Pierre I
recommended it in my gift card gift card
guide brand recommendations video which
the video went over really well which I
was excited about a lot of people had
some more future brand recommendations
for me so I appreciate that I will get
another video like that on my filming
schedule and then once the mascara is on
I'm just gonna come back into the
palette quick and grab that first white
shade again with the dose of colors
brush and I'm just going to hit the
inner corner of my eye nothing too crazy
or anything like that again just kind of
more to brighten up the eye look it's
not like a shimmer or anything which we
will do we will do later for the
nighttime look I just like to hit that
and then that's it for the eyes so
simple
finish off the face I really want to use
this sleek makeup highlighting palette
in solstice my friend Candice just
assented to me like I just opened it
yesterday and I was so excited about
this this is what the inside looks like
it comes with this brush which I'm not
going to use so it has these four
different shades in here and I'm so
excited it looks like this one is a
cream so I'll probably stay away from
that one but these two are really what
is speaking to me right now usually with
a daytime makeup look I do a little bit
of a softer glow but I just really want
to try this out and I really have no
idea if it'll be more of a natural glow
crazy glow I don't know but I'll give it
a try I have my Sigma fo3 and I think
I'm gonna come into this bottom shade
first looks maybe a little bit more on
the natural
side and then I was going to apply that
whoa okay then okay sleek Mike oh thanks
like make about recently I turned one of
their eyeshadow palettes not too long
ago and I was really really impressed
for the price especially and then the
quality inside I was very pleased with
it so that highlight is very very pretty
so I'm just gonna do a little bit on the
cheekbones here just a little bit down
the center of my nose and bridge of my
nose that's really all I do for
highlights but especially for a daytime
look like I don't don't usually get too
crazy so that is going to be it for my
highlight let's just finish off with a
lip color for my lip color I'm going to
use one of the new color pop lipsticks
one of their new Lux lipsticks this is
in the shade it's still crazy which is
just kind of a nice nude umm I typically
would go for a nude or sometimes even a
glossy lip but with my daytime looks but
I really did want to try this one out
again because I'm trying to get a feel
for them so I can review them I don't
think this was the nude that I was
thinking of this one is definitely more
of like a rosy pink Babs beauty actually
sent me a really cool package the other
day I did a recreating a YouTube
tutorial and before it became a popular
video and I actually followed one of her
tutorials and she reached out to me and
she sent me a box makeup which was so
cool I had so many lashes in there I
would had to be so excited but it was
really awesome and she's so I mean
that's so cool she didn't have to do
that at all I just thought it was super
super sweet of her to do so on my video
I'll have her channel linked down below
she did include some of these new color
pop lipsticks so I've been wanting to
get them trying them out for a review
and such and I'm like this one I feel
like it's fairly creamy on me like it
doesn't look necessarily matte and these
are supposed to be matte lipsticks but
another one that I try not too long ago
that one was like super mad on me so I'm
very confused again this one is called
still crazy so I don't know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be reviewing them sometime
soon he let me spray my face and then
one will be done just gonna use this is
setting spray from flower beauty it's
the seal the deal long-lasting setting
spray in the matte finish I'm just gonna
go ahead and spray
I really like the mist on these because
it's so fine it does not budge my makeup
at all it doesn't leave any like
droplets on my face like I just I really
do enjoy these setting sprays and this
one here is the long-lasting one so I
feel like that's important for my day to
night makeup looks because I want my
makeup to hold up all day for when I
come in with my nighttime look I will be
back in just a minute and we will switch
it up to a nighttime look
well hello I am back I know for you it's
just been a hot second but for me it's
actually been almost three hours almost
four hours now so my lip color is gone I
ate lunch earlier and all of that but I
am back to take this look to a more
nighttime look I'm gonna start off with
my face because the eyes are a little
bit more in depth for this one so I'm
just gonna finish off my face really
quickly but one of my favorite things to
do what I'm doing my day-to-night look
is to just spray my face I like it
getting a bit of hydration back in there
a little bit of a pick-me-up with a
spray so I'm gonna use this one from
pixie it's the makeup fixing mist with
rose water and green tea you can really
use any spray I'm just gonna go ahead
Superman face real quick and then like I
mentioned I do like to come in with a
powder and I'm not too shining yet with
the number-7 foundation because it's
only been about the 3-4 hours like I
said but I can notice like my chin is
just a little bit shiny and then just a
little bit of sharing right here so I'm
just gonna come in with this Maybelline
a fit me powder and this is a brush from
Valium tools it's the tapered powder
brush so what I do is I just kind of
sweep the powder along my face I mean I
don't do anything like too crazy are too
in-depth here and I like to powder my
nose and then I just give a little bit
of powder to the forehead again nothing
crazy just to pick me up for the face
take away some of that shine in areas of
that I don't want because I'm someone
who always likes it to be bronzed I'm
going it to come back in was at the elf
bronzer that I used and the same morphe
brush and I'm just gonna kind of like
revive the bronze a little bit nothing
too crazy here the blush holds up really
well that flower Beauty blush is very
very long-lasting but I'm just gonna
kind of lightly give myself a little bit
of a bronze so it comes back
and I typically do this with whichever
bronzer it is I'm using I just I have
this thing with wanting to be bronzed
okay give me the desi Perkins bronzer
helmet and then for my highlight I'm
going to come back in to that sleek
makeup palette and I'm gonna go for this
kind of like purpley shade this one
right here I'm gonna layer that over the
highlights that we already have using my
same s Sigma s o3 brush again see it's
nighttime we can tape it up now amp it
up we can get a fun highlight in there
wow there's a helipad a levan whoo
there's no joke and then that's it a for
the face I'll spray everything again
once I'm completely done with everything
but that just gives a little sugar to
the face so I'm gonna comment out the
eyes grabbing back out the big problems
palette make it Browns Paulo domes a big
bronze there's a lot of different ways
you can make a nighttime look work you
can add in glitter you can add in just
deeper shades you can do liner you can
do colorful makeup looks but I'm gonna
to go ahead and do what I did the other
weekend when I did this kind of look and
that's to grab I just again kind of move
down the line here I'm gonna grab out
that fourth shade and this is just a
smaller blending brush it's from Real
Techniques it is called the crease brush
and I'm just going to Pat that on the
outer part of the eye slowly start to
work it in but not take it on the inner
part of the eye just keep it focused on
this outer part here the darker color
I'm just going to come back in and just
slowly work on building it up instead of
going in too much right away I'm gonna
use my DHC liquid liner as mentioned
this in my overlooked two makeup
products as well I'm not the best at
applying wings on camera I'll just let
you know right now but I'm gonna give it
my best shot I'm gonna give it my best
shot but usually I'm like both hands on
my face right up against my mirror and I
don't have a table or anything so I do
have to hold my mirror in my hand so I
can only do this one hand it so we'll
just see how it goes
and that's like the worst thing I've
ever done in my life I basically just
fill in along the top and then I make
the flick and then I come back and drag
that to meet the top liner and then I
just kind of fill in any spots
I can elongate the wing up I think I
need to but that looks okay
again not probably not the best wing
you've ever seen in your life but look
it's the worst I've ever done the
hardest part is just always getting them
to be someone even it's just I mean is
that the biggest challenge facing women
today is it is it when they give these a
try from a violet boss I've only wanted
one so far these are called what these
are called strip tease know if I knew
that this is in that package that Babs
Beauty sent me and I've only tried them
out the one time so far but I want to
give them a try again I've never tried
out violet boss lashes before so I was
really excited to have these going to
use my duo I'm going to use the dark
tone one because I feel like it'll blend
in with my window liner a bit more but
you do want to let the adhesive dry for
a bit I usually wait about a full minute
because I do like it to be pretty tacky
I'm gonna use my tart lash applicator
and I come in a from the top and then I
will secure the middle of the lash first
and then I work on securing the outer
and the inner corners so I'm just going
to go ahead and try and make sure it's
lined up toward my shaman focus this is
very difficult to do on camera I'm just
gonna come in from the top place it down
push and make sure the middle is
attached to that way there is some sort
of anchor for when I start messing with
the outer parts and then I'm gonna come
in and hook down the inner part okay and
then after I have it on just make sure
we are all good we are all good at my
cameras must overheat but that is what
the strip T is about boss flash looks
like all right I got my other lash on so
I'm just
to finish off the eyes I'm going to come
in with the Marc Jacobs eyeliner this
one is in over which is a really fun
green and I'm going to put this in to
the waterline to just kind of darken up
the look a little bit and then coming
back into the pellet and grabbing out
that shade that we add it in to the
crease I'm going to take a different
brush because the one in here is a
pretty small dense brush and I want this
to be a little bit more smoked out so
I'm just taking a bigger pencil brush
this one is from a morphe set and I am
just going to smoke that out on the
lower lash line now I'm actually going
to come back into the sleek palette and
grab out the first highlight shade we
use I'm just going to use that same
pencil brush again and I'm going to add
some of that to the inner corner of the
eye just to give it a little bit Publica
low and then that's how I take my eyes
from dates night using just one palette
just adding on some liner and lashes so
that could be a really good option given
to for like traveling maybe you're doing
something during the day or you don't
want like full-on glam yet or a heavier
makeup look you do something a little
bit more simple and then at night if
you're going out having fun I mean you
just come back in the same palette and
just add a few extra steps and then
you're ready to go out for the night but
that is the eyes and then I'm just gonna
finish off with the lip color for my lip
color I'm going to use the sigma
foxglove liquid lipstick I love this lip
color and I think it's so cool I was
trying to decide if I wanted to do a red
or just a brighter shade but I haven't
worn foxglove in a hot minute and I
really do I love this color so this is
what I'm gonna use is what a sigma fox
club looks like perfect going out a lip
shade then I'm just going to go ahead
and spray my face with some Urban Decay
chill setting spray and then this makeup
look is complete so like I said I'm
going to be showing my hairstyle as well
so I'm going to be adding in some
extensions and then like I mentioned in
the beginning of the video this portion
of the video is sponsored by a verb and
I'm going to be talking a bit about
their new seat texture spray and then
just demoing it in my hair
I was really excited to give this a try
because I'm someone
was very thin hair I mean you girl got
thin hair
I've tried texture sprays in the past
but I have yet to find one that I would
go out and repurchase that I absolutely
fell in love with so to get a new
texture spray to try it out and see what
I thought I was pretty excited for this
and I'm really happy to say obviously of
course if it's making into this video
that I would stand behind this product I
was recommending it to my girlfriends
this weekend when we were out
celebrating our friends engagement so
this is one that I truly do enjoy since
I started trying it my other texture
spray has stayed safely away in its
drawer thank you to her for working with
me on this video and letting me try out
this product and I have a couple of
their other products as well I'll be
reviewing in upcoming videos also
but today we're focused on at the seat
texture spray this guy is paraben free
harmful sulfate free it's gluten free
it's cruelty free it's a vegan product
and it's $16 you can also find a verb
products available at Sephora I will
have any links down below of course so
for this guy it says it's light hold
drive volume weightless grip I think the
part that has made the most surprised of
what this product that I have seen
different from other texture sprays is
that it does not make my hair crunchy
like I said I've tried other texture
sprays in the past because I just I need
something that not only gives my hair
volume but just gives it gives it some
grit especially because I use extensions
quite a bit it is just sometimes really
difficult for my extensions to really
stick onto my hair because it's still
fine and thin that I can feel the
extension clips just sliding off and
unless I sit there and really tease my
hair which I don't like doing at all
sometimes I can have difficulties with
my extensions but what I don't like with
the texture sprays is that it makes my
hair hard and crunchy almost like I've
just put a bunch of hairspray in my hair
and a lot of times I use a texture spray
on like one to two day hair and then I
use dry shampoo on like my 3 to 4 day
hair cuz I only wash my hair twice a
week and then when I using the texture
spray on like my pretty clean fresh hair
it's destroying my hair and it's making
me have to wash it again and I don't
want to do that that is the very first
thing I would say that I noticed that
was different with this verb spray is
that it's it's it's like you have
nothing in your hair except you all of a
sudden have more texture to your hair
you have more grit to your hair
without any of the other like nasty
effects that other texture sprays give
you so I was pretty excited about that
so what you want to do is you do want to
shake it shake it shake it and then what
I do if you guys can't tell from the
last time I did a hair portion in my
video like I really I just use my hands
sometimes I'll use a comb sometimes but
I don't I don't really I'm not a hair
person you guys to be honest um so I
just kind of lift up my hair and I'll
spray it along and I just I just think
my time I lift up sections in the front
I lift up sections in the back and I
just give it some good sprays go on the
front here sprayed a bit so once we're
all sprayed then I just take my hands
and I just give my hair a nice little
Josh you don't notice anything in my
hair like any residue or anything like
that in my hair I've never noticed that
with this so once we get done doing that
whoo look we got the bathroom going on
right now then this is what my hair
looks like afterwards so you can see
that there's a bit of volume to it I
love the way this smells even my husband
has made a comment on he came home one
day goes you're like a perfume line I
was like mmm no I guess it I took me a
while but I was like oh you can smell my
texture spray of my hair I do really
like the way it smells it's nice and
fresh smelling so I have more volume to
it but obviously you guys can't feel my
hair but I can feel my hair and it
definitely just has I keep wanting to
say the word great but it just has a bit
of weight to it now but this is gonna
make it easier for me to be able to clip
in my extensions so I would recommend
this guy of course I'm not gonna come on
here and recommend a product that I
wouldn't agree with and I wouldn't take
a sponsorship on a product that I
wouldn't agree with that I wouldn't
recommend to you that I wouldn't
recommend to my friends in real life etc
so this guy I've been using every single
time I'm adding in my extensions and
then even not adding in my extensions
but those days where my hair is just
really really flat this is what I've
been going with I would repurchase this
myself with my own money I will when I
run out of this because this is a really
good texture spray so I would highly
recommend this for
ferb links will be down below but once I
have that in there what I want to do
today is actually braid my hair at the
extensions that I'm going to use today
are different from the ones I used in my
last video these are from irresistible
me these are the ones that I curl so my
other extensions from amazing Beauty
hair those are straight ears this will
me are the ones that I curl it's just
easier for me that way versus constantly
feeling like I have to wash my
extensions and this one is for clips and
it is a lot of volume and it's a lot of
hair and then when I'm doing a side
braid or a side pony or anything like
that this is the only thing that I'll
use whereas if I'm leaving my hair down
and straight I'll also want to add the
extensions like I did last time in the
front here just to help blend more but
because I'm just doing something off to
the side I only need the one clip and
like I said this is a lot of hair
actually so I feel like I can get away
with it so I just sectioned my hair off
above my ears and then I'm just gonna go
ahead and get that out of the way and
then you want to make sure your clips
are open and I again start at one side
here and I just hook the clip and then I
just go all the way around my head and
hook the clip and because I used that
texture spray I don't feel like I need
to do any of the teasing with my hair or
anything like that and it feels like
it's actually going to hold on to the
extensions it's like the extensions are
flat against my head which is fantastic
and then once it's done I have hair like
this so then I'm just gonna take out the
top part like I said I don't do the
sides and I really don't even worry
about curling the rest of my hair
because I'm doing a side part but I want
a really big thick braid that's why I
went with my thicker extensions that are
already curled because that already
gives more thickness and then I also use
the texture spray to give my regular
hair more of a thickness to it as well
and more volume to it so that way I can
have a big old braid so I just part my
hair all over to the side you want to do
is a regular braid I'm telling you guys
I'm not a makeup artist I'm not a hair
stylist you just this is just me this is
just a normal night out and what I want
to do but I love having a really big
thick
Hey right that's what I enjoy cell I'm
just gonna go ahead and braid my hair
like normal so I just go ahead and do
that and then I take the braids and I
start to pull it apart this is like one
of my favorite things to do I'm just
gonna go ahead and pull through the
braid just to make it even bigger so
once it's done your braid should look
something like this so that is the
hairstyle that I'm going to be doing
this is a hairstyle that I do a ton I
don't know how to do hair very well but
I feel like it's super easy to just pop
in some extensions give yourself a big
ol braid and you are ready to go so that
is going to be it for the hair section I
know that this was earth-shattering but
I hope that you guys enjoyed it I'll
have my extensions link down below and
of course I will have VirB down below as
well thank you guys so much for watching
this video thank you tuber for
sponsoring this portion of the video and
why don't we go ahead and get changed
now already and then here is some outfit
info for you so oh there there she you
yep need your camera time always needs
her camera time okay so what I have
going on today is just a really simple
pair of black leggings these are from
Victoria's Secret but they are just like
no fuss no frills just good old black
leggings and then I have a black I have
a black a camisole top she is the queen
black and carry on it has some lace
detail right here which i think is
pretty and then this is a cardigan that
I got from honey bum I really like it
because you can wear it simple like this
and what I'm doing kind of like this
all-black look I like to kind of leave
it undone like this or you can also wrap
it up if you want and it can make more
of a crop to look which i think is
really cute as well sometimes I'll wear
it without the cami underneath and I'll
tie it up and wear it as more of like a
regular crop top so there's a lot of
different options with it but I thought
that I was digging this a kind of a look
today and then my shoes are just some
Brown booties here that I got from and
oh there's my husband slippers these
ones I don't know I've had them for a
while I might have gotten him from
Kohl's but most everything in my outfit
is just like older things up in my
collection for awhile
except for this wrap from honey bum I do
have just some little earrings in just
um just some earrings that I've had
forever and then my watch is
the watch that I was wearing in my last
show t D this is from your watches so I
will have that one will sit down below
but I feel like it goes really well with
this outfit but I really like this
outfit it's one that I wear quite a bit
as well so I thought it would be fun to
show but after that that's gonna do it
