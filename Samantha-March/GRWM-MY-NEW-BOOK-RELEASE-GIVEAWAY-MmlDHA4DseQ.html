today's video is going to be get ready
with me and I am so excited because
today is actually a really exciting day
for me
so today that this video goes live which
is Friday May 25th is a release day for
my six novel if you guys have never
heard me say it before I am a published
author this is my sixth title that is
now on sale today and I'm just I'm
really happy and really excited and
really proud that this day is here I do
get asked a lot if I would make videos
focusing on books or writing or
something along those lines
I do include book favorites in my makeup
monthly every single month and I do chat
fairly often especially during the
writing and publishing process on other
social media platforms such as snapchat
and Instagram stories and I'm on Twitter
all the time of course but I thought it
would be really fun to do a get ready
style video where I'm just doing my
makeup but chatting about writing this
book what this book is about how you can
find it and I also asked if anyone would
have any questions for this video and I
did get some questions and so I'm gonna
be answering some some questions along
the way as well so that's kind of what
today's video is gonna be about I'm so
excited to do this video excited to chat
about the six so Christie which is my
first is series I'm so excited to start
a series so yeah if you want to get
ready with me and hear a little bit
about my author life let me go ahead and
get started
some zoomed in I got my ears on so my
curly hair is like wahoo but for this
get ready with me I'm gonna try to focus
mostly on just talking and answering any
questions that I am going to be about
like sharing what makeup products I'm
using and how I'm applying them and all
of that today's video is gonna be all
about chatting but I will of course
leave everything that I'm using a link
in the description box so like I said
this is my sixth book which is really
exciting here is the cover of Christie
and this is my first series which I'm
very excited about I've always wanted to
write a series so this is going to be a
six part series which is why it's called
the six and then just each book is going
to be the girl's name it's gonna be the
six Christie the second book is the six
scarlet and so on and so forth so I'm
excited
this I love how the cover came out is
available for sale on Amazon and it's
available in both ebook and also
paperback or you can also buy paperbacks
on my website which is chiclet plus com
I will have everything all the links and
everything will be down below of course
and if you want a signed paperback copy
that's where you can purchase them
through my website if you're not worried
about being signed or anything like that
you can also purchase the paperback
through Amazon I am going to try to get
an audiobook made unfortunately getting
an audiobook made is not quite as easy
as a lot of people think I just got a
foundation all over my shirt but that's
okay nothing deal to find a reliable
narrator is incredibly difficult
incredibly difficult it's also extremely
extremely pricey and I know a lot of
people asked if I would narrate my own
books but you have to have really
particular and expensive software to be
able to do that you really have to have
like a soundproof room which I do not
have actually very very challenging to
publish an audio book but I keep trying
I do have I think it's two that are
available now on audible also through
Amazon as well I'm gonna do my face
first
obviously I'm already doing my face
first I just feel like it's it's just
gonna be more comfortable for me to do
that and then my eyes I am gonna do some
glitter and stuff today but it's a look
I've been doing lately that I really
like and I really don't I don't see too
much with like fall out herself on my
face so I'm not too concerned so like I
said I have six books out I I've always
known that I wanted to be a writer
always I'm a huge fan of books I'm a
huge fan of reading always have been I
feel like there's a lot of books that
have really influenced my life and even
you know quite honestly changed my life
all for the butter and yeah I've just
always known since I was a little girl
that I wanted to write books I didn't go
to school or anything for it
I went to a business college because I
kind of thought being an author was like
I always compared it to wanting to like
make it in Hollywood and like be an
actress I heard myself to go to business
school and if I still wanted to publish
a book after I finished school then I
could do it and I started writing my
book while still in college and
published shortly after so
it's just always been a goal of mine I
absolutely love it I love being able to
create that way but when I realized that
I really did want to like give writing a
go you know I thought about like what my
mom always says it's not what you know
it's who you know who you know and I
knew nobody in the book industry I had
no idea what to do or how to start so it
was a big reason why I decided to start
my book blog which is called chiclet
plus I started chiclet plus as for a
couple different reasons you know one to
be able to talk with like-minded people
who really enjoyed books and were as
passionate about them as I was because I
didn't have that a lot in my real life
and I would frustrate me because I would
read a book that you know have left me
feeling so many different ways and I
couldn't talk to anybody about it and I
was like me and I just wish I had
someone around me that I could talk to
about these characters and how they made
me feel and I really had no idea this
was back in 2009 I had no idea that what
starting a book blog would do and I
really feel like every step since then I
I can put it all back on chiclet plus
and saying like you decided that you
were really gonna go for it and it's
given me so many cool opportunities I
mean I definitely credit it with the
help of publishing books I I met so many
people in the industry and people that
were willing to help me out and help me
get through the process of publishing a
book it's just been really incredible
and of course from starting chiclet plus
it wasn't just a book blog if you're not
familiar Chiclets is a book of genre
it's similar to women's fiction but it's
kind of more lighthearted a little bit
more humorous and it's what I consider
the 6 to be it's going to be mostly a
chiclet series but I knew that I wanted
to talk about more than just books on my
blog so that's where the plus came in
and when I first started I would talk
about celebrities and the workouts that
I was doing and I would review makeup
products on there like I just wanted
whatever my passions were and things I
was interested in I wanted to put those
all into my blog so that's kind of where
the name came from of course you know
not only did it help me publish books
but I started you know I'm freelance
editing
proofreading for novels I started to
work really heavily in book marketing
which was so much fun and I learned so
much but then just over time I feel like
it's really helped me get more into
social media you know now with my
youtube channel I mean I feel like I've
learned so much through chiclet plus and
really having that platform to really
helped me when I decided to venture out
into other social media platforms as
well so it was just such a cool thing
and I always recommend to anybody if you
know if there's anything that you want
to do just start it and and see what
happens because you never really know I
mean I would not have guessed that
starting a simple blog could have led me
to being able to be a full time dream
chaser that's what I call myself
I don't consider YouTube my full-time
job I don't consider being an author a
full-time job I consider all of it under
one umbrella my full-time job both books
and beauty and everything that I do in
all these different facets I consider
all of that to be full-time so instead
of you know putting myself into one
category I just say that I'm a full-time
dream chaser and you know do I feel
lucky yes but I also know how hard I
work especially in the beginning when I
was you know in my young 20s I would sit
at home so often trying to learn about
blogging you know reading my books
writing my book reviews interviewing
authors I mean the biggest thing was
like trying to learn HTML and coding and
stuff for the blogs like I know how many
times I didn't go out with friends or I
would miss an event or something because
I was trying to work because not only
did I work three jobs at the time I was
also trying to have a successful blog I
was also trying to write a book I was
also trying to do all these freelance
jobs on the side I mean my schedule was
crazy for the longest time so sometimes
when people are like oh you're so lucky
this is what you get to do I'm like yes
but I worked my ass off to get here too
I mean I worked hard and I think there's
a lot that goes into that too and I
never want to forget I never want to
forget those parts you know I did ask
for some questions so I want to
into some of these questions so I can
get these answered so this one is from
Maria Miller from YouTube
she says congrats on your book release
I'd love to know if you ever get stuck
trying to come up with specific parts of
a book and how you get over that I I'm
always stuck at certain parts of a book
usually the ending always always it
causes me a struggle that final scene
how to end it a lot of times the
beginning of the book becomes more
naturally to me but the ending is
definitely very tough but what I say if
you have writer's block which I also
deal with a ton if you have writer's
block the easiest thing that I can say
are like the best piece of advice that I
can say is to keep a writing you know
maybe just don't write that scene skip
over that scene for right now wait for
that seem to come to you another time
just keep writing something else or just
write write something else you know I'm
writing a series right now so there's a
lot of scenes that I'm writing for
Scarlett's book but at the same time at
that I'm writing Scarlett's book scenes
from the future books are popping into
my head so if I'm stuck on scarlet which
I've already been stuck on scarlet a
bajillion times I'll get stuck on
something from her I'll go into the
third book and I'll start writing back I
think the biggest thing when you're
stuck with writing is to keep writing
because if you're stuck and you stop
it's harder to get back into it because
a lot of times you feel frustrated but
if you've continued to keep writing
eventually that scene will come to you
we're going to say in the beginning that
there will be a giveaway I'll talk about
that more towards the end of the video
I'm just like so excited so all over the
place but I've always celebrated a book
release with a giveaway so I have a big
ol box full of prizes that I'll show you
here at the end and how to enter into
the giveaway so stay tuned for that but
another question that came in this was
from Mary made up she said I really want
to know what the publishing process is
like how do you find the publisher or
are you self-published I am
self-published I've always been
self-published my publishing company is
called marching Inc and it actually used
to like I used to publish for other
authors as well and I stopped doing that
I think it was about two years ago now
mostly because the IRS is super fun and
taxes were becoming
kind of like a total and complete
nightmare we had so many books and
authors from other countries and foreign
titles and all of this and it's got to
be extremely extremely overwhelming but
yes I've always been self-published and
it's what I've always wanted to do once
a self-publishing kind of came on the
scene
I immediately it was kind of like that's
what I want to do because I just always
have that kind of entrepreneurial spirit
like I said I went to school for
business and a lot of my courses were in
entrepreneurship and you know how to run
your own business and and all of that so
that's kind of always what I've been
interested in so when that started
coming on to the scene I that would be
perfect like that's what I want to do
and especially when you're able to do
something yourself all of a sudden like
anything becomes attainable to me how I
said that I didn't want to pursue
writing in college because I thought
that dream was too far it was because
you were having to count on other people
to find you and to find your work and
you know you know all of that it just I
just truly believed like that would
never happen for me and so once it was
like you can do this yourself I just I
guess I've always kind of had this
attitude not always but for a long time
I've kind of had this attitude of like
if I want it I'll do it I can do it like
I I truly believe in myself in those
kinds of ways so I thought I just knew
that that's what I wanted to do
self-publishing
is definitely a challenging process
that's for sure there's a lot of upfront
money that goes into self-publishing and
a lot of times when you're a
self-published author you also don't get
to like charge as much for your books
and so I mean the money is definitely
not there I don't write books because
it's making me a millionaire and all of
that I write books because it's
something I'm passionate about and
something that I want to do how I feel
about writing but I enjoy that I create
my own schedule that I that I write the
books that I want to write that I don't
let anyone else have control over that
voice that's what I love
so this next question is from Emily and
done on snapchat she said I know this is
a six-part series and you have been
releasing one novel a year I believe
does that mean you will only be writing
this series for the next five to six
years are you afraid of getting bored or
burnt out with the characters or the
storyline so that's a great question and
yes I have said in the past that I
typically put out about one book a year
especially with just my schedule down
just how busy I am it's it's a very
challenging I left my job at the
hospital a couple of years ago and it
was to focus on trying to write more
books and have more time for it and then
I decided to start a YouTube channel and
then that keeps me very busy as well but
I do want to release like my goal for
this is to release two books a year for
this series and the series is shorter
than most of my normal books I'm gonna
use this blush from NARS nor send me
their new orgasm blush that I was just
talking about my last bit of a video and
I'm super excited to give those a try
but um so the series the books are
shorter than my regular books my normal
books are about 70 to 80 thousand words
and this series is going to be more
towards like the 50,000 word mark so it
might not seem like a huge decrease of
words to some but it's definitely makes
the writing process quicker and another
good thing about writing a series that I
didn't quite realize before I started
writing a series was like when I was
writing Chrissy's book I was also
continually writing scenes for
Scarlett's book because something would
happen in Christie and it would you know
like the next scene and Scarlett's book
would come into my mind
so it's stopped writing Christie and I
would start to write scarlet and now the
same thing is happening as I'm writing
scrubs book I'm not writing the third
book as well so that helps it go quicker
you know I already have a ton of words
written for scarlet now I just have to
put all those things together and then
write the rest of the scenes so I really
really hope that the writing process
will be quicker this time around and I
can release more because that's
definitely you know that's a great point
is you don't want to get too burned out
on your characters and I just have so
many other books that I want to write so
I want to get the series out as quickly
as I can with it still being you know
look at all of that so hopefully
hopefully we can do at least two a year
but it's interesting I've been I've been
learning a lot taking on my first series
that's for sure so this is from Elena on
Instagram she said what inspired your
book series so I have always wanted to
write a girlfriend series I write a lot
of friendship fiction and female
friendships just are super fascinating
to me I'm gonna be using my brush bag
from Sigma and Angelica yeah super
excited about this I'm also going to use
the color poplin kathleenlights train
Street palette I'm gonna do an eye look
that I've been really liking lately it's
like quick and easy but it's a spotlight
eye which I think are quick and easy but
then I add a little bit of glitter and I
feel like it just kind of like looks
nice but it's still really fast and
really easy to do so thinking about
friendships are super interesting I mean
obviously I'm a female myself I'm 31
I've had a lot of friendships throughout
my life you know some I've had for many
many years you know some friendships
have ended that have devastated me but
it's just it's just a topic that I find
to be interesting and you know a lot of
my books are on that you know especially
a questionable friendship is about the
dynamic between two particular girls
that book was and it was on bestseller
and one of my favorite books that I have
written on defining her touches on two
females who didn't start as friends but
it started to form a friendship and that
is another one of my favorite books that
I've written it's just it's just
interesting for me to write and to have
these characters come alive in my mind
and to write their stories and see how
they treat their friends and how they
expect to be treated in their
friendships it's just something that
interests me so much so this question is
from looks like an MTA on Instagram she
said so happy about your book release I
already pre-ordered thank you so much
the question is did you draw from your
personal life to create characters plots
etc in your books
definitely across is some of my books
there's been bits of me in there but I
don't necessarily have like an
autobiographical book or anything
my first book destined to fail has a lot
of me in there but not all of me but I I
touch on some of the harder parts of my
life I've been through some bad moments
in time and one thing that I tell myself
when I go through these moments is that
it has to be for a reason and my reason
is to be able to write a story and maybe
help other people who are going through
that same thing so I just kind of look
back with the things that I've gone
through in life that haven't been great
that you know have brought me down and I
put those into my stories for Christy
I'm really not like Christy at all
courtesy is not me in the slightest
we're very very different people but in
Christy's book there is a situation
where there's a little girl in the book
and that little girl is me her name is
Mei in the story christy is an
elementary school guidance counselor and
she has a student coming to her office
and talked to her about being abused and
that is my story of course as I'm
working on my eye makeup I talk about
this maybe times like these where it's
okay that my camera overheats because it
gave me a little break to kind of
prepare this part of the video because
it's kind of hard to talk about but Mays
story really is mine I was sexually
abused as a child by a family member I
told a friend on the way to school as we
were walking to school and she told me
to talk to our guidance counselor and I
did that morning and the first thing I
did was she walked me to the guidance
counselor's office and I told her what
was going on and she called the police
and she called in my mom and my stepdad
and I mean my life was my life was
forever changed from that moment it's
weird because sometimes I feel like the
more defining moment from all of that
was me actually telling the story me
actually coming forward and saying this
was going on versus the actual act of
being abused because you know obviously
my life had changed but nobody is nobody
else's life had changed from that point
you know I don't that makes a ton of
sense but my symptom
but you know once you actually come
forward with something like that you
obviously can't you can't go back from
that and that's when everything had to
to change and that's when my family went
through a lot less after that so that's
kind of what I consider to be the more
defining moment that that changed a lot
of my life and that really put into
motion a lot of things that would happen
not even just that year but years down
the road things that happened to my life
that you can you can look at it and say
you know it happened in large part
because of the abuse and because of what
it did to our family so because that you
know moment in my life is so pivotal to
me I have always wanted to write that
scene but there has never been a book or
a character that that called for that
scene but you know with Christie I was
able to make heard the elementary school
guidance counselor and that's when I
could finally write that scene it was
the longest two scene it took me to
write in that book because I kept having
to take breaks because I was too
emotional to write it and then also
every time I read that scene I am a mess
every single time and I have read that
book obviously several times looking for
mistakes making things flow and every
single time I get to that chapter I get
upset and it's actually interesting I've
sent out some you know early reader
copies like I do with all of my books
and I have gotten out several emails
from people connecting with that scene
on a personal level and just being
thanked for writing that scene like I
said when I go through hard things in
life and I think that I can write about
it this is why I don't really know
exactly for sure where the series is
gonna go I'm not someone who plots a lot
I just start writing and the characters
go from there so
I don't know what parts of my life and
my friendships will get incorporated
into the story along the way we'll just
have to see so I did kind of like my
spotlight eye and then now I'm just
going to come over and I'm gonna put
some glitter on top of it and this is
urban decay grind and again I just feel
like it's really fast and you see and it
looks really nice okay so another
question is this is from domine on
YouTube she says do you plot out the
book before we start writing are you
just jumping to scenes that are
inspiring you it's like I said I really
don't plot like I know my characters
names and what they look like on their
occupations and I know the point of the
story that I'm trying to write but all
of the scenes all of like there's even
like little actions that happen in the
book like a little twist that I don't
know we're coming until I start writing
they just take over I'm she also says do
you have different people read it and
proofread / suggest edits before you
send it off to the official editing
process and I do I let people like close
to me read the story and offer me
feedback and then I also have what are
called beta readers for each of my
titles and beta readers are just people
that I know it's typically people in the
book industry like other bloggers or
things like that other authors they read
the book early and they give me their
feedback it helps me out so much I will
always always always have beta readers
because they I believe are just so
important in the process and then it's
really nice to have them because even
when I'm doing something like the cover
design you know they are some of the
first readers of the book so I can send
them the covers and be like hey does
this make sense do you like this cover
do you think this cover sucks and
they're just so helpful to have so yes I
definitely have early people before I
start you know really paying for outside
services another question this is from a
bro COF she says what was the
inspiration behind this newly released
books also are there any sneak peeks if
you talk about makeup skincare at beauty
in the book so I kind of give the
inspiration just really being interested
in in female friendships and also just
always wanting to write a a series and I
have found myself really enjoying other
girlfriends series I'm Savannah Paige is
an author - I absolutely adore
she also has a girlfriend series that I
just loved so much and I found to be so
fascinating I'll go ahead and link her
Amazon down below in case you'd be
interested in it the baby-sitters club
was a huge part of my childhood a huge
huge part
I loved the baby-sitters club I loved
I've read all of those books I used to
collect the books some of my early
readers have also noticed that the main
character's name in Christie is Christie
Martin
that is definitely a play on Christie is
the the first character in the
baby-sitters club series the first book
that was written and the series is
written by Anne that Martin Christy
Martin that was kind of my homage to
Anna Martin and to the baby-sitters club
here I was overheating so I did my brows
and added some liner real quick as well
but her other question was any sneak
peeks if you talk about makeup skincare
beauty in the book there is a little bit
throughout there Christie is not a big
makeup kind of gal but we'll definitely
see that with some future girls but
there is a little bit in there and the
giveaway that I said that I'll chat
about in a few minutes here I have a
couple questions in there and they kind
of relate to those scenes in the book
either like what brand got mentioned in
this chapter you know or what mascara is
she using in this chapter I wanted to do
some bonus entries for people who are
purchasing the book it would be funny to
add in you know some of those scenes
regarding like skincare brands that get
mentioned and makeup products that get
mentioned things like that so you'll see
those in the giveaway but I wanted to do
something and a lot of the prizes that
are in the giveaway our beauty focus
because honestly like I get blown away
by how much support I get from my books
on the Beauty side of things and unlike
this Beauty Channel and stuff it
honestly is like crazy to me a little
bit in there but you know Christy
doesn't wear false lashes so again
Christy and I are not a lot of like but
you'll see some from the future girls as
well that go more into the Beauty side
of things okay Jill from YouTube has a
question she says how old were you when
your first book was published and how
long did it take you to write it I think
I was like 24 I want to say like 24 25
when my first book published it writing
it while I was in college but it took
years and years and
it was one of those things where I was
super nervous of course to publish your
first book and you think everything's
gonna be wrong and being self-published
there was a lot to learn and all of that
I'm not gonna do lashes today I haven't
been doing lashes lately either except
been busy and outside and all that but I
just recently started trying the Urban
Decay perversion mascara and I quite
liked it
so I'm gonna try again today but yeah it
took a lot of time in editing because my
editor really wanted me to change a lot
and it was something that I learned too
early on like how I said I didn't want
to publish her to like change the voice
in my books I definitely let my first
editor change the voice my books like
completely changed the book from the
first destined to fail that I wrote to
the destined to fail that was published
they are like night and day different
books and I'm actually like I'm not
pleased with how it ended up coming out
and I felt like because you know it was
my first book and I was kind of like not
knowing what I was doing not that I
don't want to say like I was bullied
into making the changes but I feel like
I was pressured into making the changes
I'll say and I kind of wish that I
haven't because I don't know I just I
don't know I know I'm not totally
thrilled with how that story came out
but it was a good lesson and I learned a
lot from it and you know what I want
with the people that I'm working with
with all the changes that this editor
kept asking for I basically rewrote the
book three times
so obviously that took a really long
time so again that's something where I
wish I hadn't have done that because I
could have published it sooner and just
gotten on my way sooner but again it's
just it's a life lesson that's all I can
chalk it up to how long did it take to
write it I mean I'm gonna go ahead and
say like three years well that's crazy
so I'm squinting because I just thought
my mascara okay another question is from
a case Kelly on YouTube she says can you
give advice on how to get the ideas from
your head to paper I've been wanting to
write a kids book for ages but can't
quite get it to gel thanks so going back
to kind of the advice that I gave
earlier is just to start like you just
have to start writing and if you get
ideas in your head put them into like
the notes on your phone I do that all
the time I have so many notes on my
phone filled with scenes that pop into
my head or a particular wording that
comes to
I had something like that keep a book by
your nightstand a lot of times I will
get ideas when I'm just laying in bed
thinking because I'm not doing anything
like I'm not working I'm not focusing on
anything else I'm just sitting there
thinking and scenes will pop in so have
a notebook or again your phone next to
your bed so you can write them down but
always write down when you have scenes
come to you I think that's so important
don't just say like oh I'll come back to
it later or when I'm finally sitting in
front of my computer I'll come back to
it and write that scene write it down
right then and then you know making gel
when you get to your computer and put
different scenes together but just
always be writing down when inspiration
strikes this question is from Diana
Walter she said what do you do if you
write something and feel it is good
enough to publish I always wonder how
you even get your foot in the door once
you write something and you're trying to
decide what to do next the first steps
is really deciding if you want to
self-publish or if you want to go a
traditional route decide what it is you
want to do and then really go for it if
you decide you want a traditional route
you know you want to look up agents you
know maybe find some of your favorite
books and look to see in the
acknowledgments who they think is their
agent look up those agencies learn how
to query them and go from there if you
want to self-published I mean of course
there's a lot of Google searches that
you can do to figure out how there's a
ton of different writer groups that you
can join you know online to a lot of
different Facebook groups so you can ask
people questions like okay how do I get
an ISBN then can anybody recommend an
editor in this group and so on and so
forth that's what I did when I decided I
wanted to self-publish
I asked question after question after
question to anyone who would help me I
googled a crap-ton out of the questions
that I wanted and that kind of really
helped me out so I think once you have
something and you want to go for it you
need to decide which route to take and
then it'll kind of help put the pieces
into place as to what it is your next
steps will be next question is from
Janelle she said my questions would be
how did you get published did you submit
to companies are you self-published what
is the editing process like and do you
have an agent so I kind of talked over
our you know self-publishing why I
decided to self-publish so I don't have
an agent
you know I'm slowly for myself highlight
I'm going it to use a little bit of a
champ
because I feel like it's time to
celebrate in here and so what the
editing process is like I think it's
just gonna be different depending on who
your editor is and what it is that
you're looking for with editing like I
said my first editor basically wanted to
look I feel like she just wanted to
write the story herself okay and you
know I rewrote it over and over and over
again to please her and I truly don't
feel like that's that should be the way
it is I feel like with an editor they
should just be doing their best to make
your story the best and I mean that can
be suggesting to delete entire scenes
out of the book this scene is not moving
your story forward this scene is not
adding anything to your books you don't
want wasted words you never want wasted
words in your book so if scenes aren't
doing anything for the story you can cut
them out and get rid of them they can
add in suggestions hey a scene should be
at it here or you know this character
maybe we don't understand why it she
went from this point to this point we
need some filler scenes in there kind of
showing that you know I feel like that's
that's what they should be there for
you're hiring an editor make sure to to
basically interview them you want to
make sure that you're going to get along
ask for samples of their work
ask them to edit the first you know 10
pages of your novel so you can see their
process and how they do it and make sure
that you're going to get along because
you're going to work with them a lot so
it's gonna be awful if you don't get
along or you don't like the way that
they do it so that's just a little bit
about editing I probably could make an
entire video about that though from
Kiera's the best she says what is your
favorite and least favorite part about
writing and the publishing process my
favorite part is seeing it all come
together the first time that I read
through the book at the end and see how
it's all come together
I honestly sometimes have that feeling
of like me like it's such a cool feeling
also holding my physical book in my
hands for the first time I have never
not cried when that's happened that's a
really cool feeling my least favorite
part is probably going through the edit
and the proofreading process I think
it's mostly just because it takes so
long and also that's the time where I
have to rely on someone else and their
schedule and that's that can be really
frustrating to me face is complete I'm
just gonna finish off with my lip color
I'm going to use Urban Decay Naked so
it's tough to have your book in someone
else's hands because I just feel like no
matter who it is no one cares about your
book as much as you do
no one cares about getting your book out
as quickly as you do and so just when
you have to deal with someone else who
you know even though you're paying them
they have other clients they have a life
they have things come up and things can
get delayed and pushed back and honestly
that's my least favorite part and I got
these little lip toppers from Asia way
and this was in the package bags beautii
sent to me i'm gonna use a little bit of
san Tropez and just pop it on just
because I'm like really feeling like the
glitter and champagne table and like
let's add a glittery little lip topper
shall we and just see mmm okay guys so
this is the look that I managed to come
up with like I said I'll leave
everything that I use linked in the
description box if there's anything that
