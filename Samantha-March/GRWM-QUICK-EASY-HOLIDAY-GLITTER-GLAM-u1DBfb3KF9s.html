today the video is going to be a little
holiday get ready with me I'm gonna be
doing my makeup on camera showing you
what has become my go-to really quick a
really easy simple holiday inspired
makeup look I busted it out this weekend
got so many compliments on it and I had
very minimal time to get ready so this
is the look that I did so I'm excited to
share it with you guys also I am pretty
excited for this video because it is in
partnership with Dell um tools so a big
THANK YOU to tell them to us for
sponsoring this video going to be
chatting and using this brush that they
sent me a couple weeks back that I have
been testing out and so I'll chat a
little bit more about Delian tools of
this brush set and some of the other
brushes that they have to offer so I'm
really really excited a huge thank you
to them for sponsoring this video and
thank you guys so much for watching and
for the support I appreciate it so much
so without further ado if you ever need
to see my quick and easy simple holiday
glitter makeup look yes let's just get
started as we are working with glitter I
am going to start with the eyes first
and seriously it is so so simple I
decided that I was going to do this look
because this weekend we were out of town
on Friday at a birthday party and we had
another birthday party to go to
in our town on Saturday night we ended
up leaving town way later than we
thought we were going to on Saturday we
got back at 3 o'clock and we had dinner
reservations at 5 and not only were we
just going to the restaurant we were
going to a friend's house first to drop
off our dog since we were gonna be gone
all night that way all the dogs were
gonna be in one spot and we could easily
leave real quick and go back let the
dogs out and all that fun stuff
is so when we got home at 3:00 I was
like oh my gosh
crunch time so I feel like with glitter
looks it's just so easy to make it look
like you've spent a lot of time it like
it's kind of like fancier I got so many
compliments on my eye look on Saturday
and I was like yeah that took me five
minutes to do so thank you so much but
to start with the eyes I did already
primed my eyes off camera and I'm gonna
come in with the Sigma warm neutrals of
volume 2 eyeshadow palette I have really
been loving on this eyeshadow palette
it's definitely my type of tones I have
a tutorial on Instagram using some
these red shades in here as well and I
just really like it it's really simple
especially when doing this kind of like
simple makeup look as well I just keep
reaching into this one and it does also
have a nice mirror so I'm for is going
to come in with this brush from bdellium
tools of this is called their large
tapered blending I'm just gonna grab
that one and pick up the first shade
humble and I'm just going to sweep this
all over the eyelid to kind of set the
primer and act as a base and it coming
into the palate again I'm gonna grab the
shade toasty right here on the end and
use the tapered blending brush from
bdellium tools and I'm just going to
sweep this in to the crease and I'm not
really being super precise with this
because the glitter is basically going
to cover everything that into toastie a
few times and build it up the next
darkest shade in here I just feel like
it's a little bit too dark for what I'm
going for
so I just take my time and build up
toasty a little bit here on the eyes
sighs then I'm gonna come in with the
star of the show these are the Stila
magnificent glitters I never recall
their full name off the top of my head
magnificent metals glitter and glow eye
shadows this is not the one that I use
on Saturday but I have like five five or
six of these glitters and I feel like
this one which is a rose gold retro this
is just one of my absolute favorites I
love rose gold but I also like a kitten
karma I wore smoldering satin I believe
it was on a Saturday night and I also
have see siren which is really pretty as
well and bronze bell I think those are
all the ones that I own but every single
one is really gorgeous but this one is
just one of my favorites so this is rose
gold retro and these are what the
applicators look like I mean I'm sure
you've seen these plenty of times this
is what it looks like and I like these
glitters which is shocking to me because
I didn't think I was going to I actually
have a subscriber Dimitra send me a
bunch of these because I was just so
hesitant about them because they're $24
a piece which is pretty pricey for a
glitter so I was like I don't know I
just don't know if it would be worth it
but I'm so happy that she did because I
actually ended up including them in my
best of beauty 2017 video offer me
I have really sensitive eyes so
sometimes I can't wear glare there are
certain brands and certain glitters I've
just burned my eyes when I wear them
these I do not burn my eyes at all so I
enjoyed them so much I feel like they're
super long lasting and as long as you
kind of mess around with the glitter
while it's still wet like if you need to
buff anything out or blend anything as
long as you do it what the glitter is
still wet I do not get any fallout there
is one time where I waited till I waited
too long and it was almost completely
dried and then I tried to kind of like
buff out the edges and I had glitter
follow it on my face so just use it
quickly and you shouldn't have any
problems I also really don't ever use a
glitter glue glitter primer or anything
like that and I find no trouble with it
sticking to my lids and lasting all
night so I think that these are so
pretty
so easy to use so I'm just gonna go
ahead and pop this on so what I do is
just apply it all over the eyelid I like
to give it on the inner corner as well
and then come all the way out I put it
fairly up like towards the crease but
not quite like all the way in the crease
and while it's still wet I'm going to
grab out this is a square lip brush from
bdellium tools I also don't want to look
up right away in case anything would get
a little crazy but I like using brushes
like this kind of more synthetic brushes
to kind of work with the glitter and
manipulate it in any way that I want
really all I'm doing you're just kind of
softly running it over the crease I like
to kind of like square out the outer V
here kind of like to make sure that it
looks a bit blended without using a big
blending brush because I feel like that
can also cause some fallout so just kind
of moving it around just a little bit
really I mean I feel like you really
don't even need this stuff either but
it's just something that I like to do so
really that's all the messing around
that I'm going to do with it I'm just
going to let it dry and then I will work
on the other eye feels awkward not being
able to look up
and as all that I'm gonna do for the
eyes right now I will be popping on
eyelashes a little bit later of course
you can just do mascara but I'd normally
do lashes even when I'm in a rush but I
like to make sure the glitter is fully
completely dried down before I put the
lashes on so I'm gonna work on my face
and next but I mean seriously it's super
simple for the eyes but I wanted to take
a minute here to chat about the Adelie
tools brush a set that I got so I've
been trying out dumb tools for the past
a couple months here I've gotten a
couple products here and there so I've
been trying out the brand and seeing
what I think of them and I was really
excited when they asked me to work on
this video with them I was just as super
grateful for that so the brushes that
they sent along for me to use in this
video come in this really nice kind of
Navy makeup brush bag here which I just
think is amazing we were out of town
over the weekend and I just put all of
my brushes in here and traveled with
them so these are called the golden
triangle collection of brushes and they
do have three different they call them
phases so there's phase 1 phase 2 phase
3 and I got phase 2 they are all one
hundred and forty dollars for 15 brushes
each and then also the makeup bag and
they also do have an eye brushes only
collection as well and you would still
get the bag and inside this just at 15 I
brushes and that is 110 dollars you can
also get the brushes individually or if
you want this set they have all of the
brushes to list out under each phase so
you can see exactly what is in each
collection in which collection would
work best for you so again this comes
with 15 brushes so far I have used the
large tapered blending brush which looks
like so and then also I used the tapered
blending which is just a really nice
blending brush and then also you saw me
use the square lip brush which I don't
use the lip brush as a ton every once in
a while I do and it's nice to have but
again I will like to use this type of
brush when working with the glitters or
shimmers or things like that and then
also inside I will say that I've been
using these for a while and I clean them
over the weekend too so they could be
nice and pretty for this video and then
I used them again the other day so now
all of them are clean so that was my bed
I wasn't thinking clearly but I did do
an Instagram video as well using mostly
the valium tools brushes in that
tutorial so if those are already up on
my Instagram I am pre filming with
Christmas and all but if that is up I
will post it otherwise they'll be coming
soon it to my Instagram but some of the
nice clean brushes that I have in here
are the bent eyeliner brush which looks
like so and then we also have the small
angle brush which I love using these for
like gel liners and then also this is
the bold concealer brush but I would
typically use this again for shimmers on
the eyelid glitters things like that
that's mostly what I use those for or
another use that I use this for a lot is
to apply eyelid primer to my eyelids
that's kind of my favorite kind of brush
to use that with and then we also have
an angled brow brush which is this I was
excited to see in the collection because
I've recently started trying more brow
pomade and not all of them come with a
brow brush so I was excited to see that
this one here is a face brush this is
the slanted precision kabuki I will be
using this for foundation you can see
it's a little dirty because I've been
using it for foundation I thought maybe
at first it would be too small but it's
actually really simple to blend
everything out and I do like the kabuki
style brushes for foundation also in
here I have the precision blusher brush
what I've actually been using this for
and what you'll see me use it for today
it's contoured you know of course with
brushes you can use them for whatever
you know purpose you might have like yes
they might say one purpose but you can
use them for whatever you feel most
comfortable with so I use it for contour
or I could use it to set powder on my
under eyes I also like brushes like that
for that use another face brush in here
is the tapered contour brush typically
what I use this for what I have been
using it for is for my highlighter I
think it's a really nice tapered
highlight brush also in here is the
pencil brush which I love pencil brushes
I think these are just like an absolute
staple so nice for bugging out lower
lash line work and let's see another eye
brush we have is the blending brush this
is just a smaller blending brush really
nice for kind of like the second
transition color I use the first
blending brush for the first color like
I did in today's video and then if I'm
adding a deeper crease color I will come
in with the blending brush like so
and then this one is the large shader
brush this is what I use to apply color
on it to my eyelid and then the last two
brushes here this one is the powdered
blending brush what I actually use this
for is for my bronzer it's a nice a
dense brush but I feel like it's really
good for applying bronzer and then the
final item I have here is a tapered
powder I would use this to apply any
sort of setting powder to my face or to
also wipe away if I'm doing any baking I
like to take a brush like this and wipe
away the baking with it or it's also
really nice if you just need to blend
your makeup like if maybe your contour
your bronzer your blush if it's not
looking fully blended or if it's looking
a little too much I like to take a clean
brush like this and just kind of blend
everything together to make sure
everything is really smooth so those are
all of the brushes that came in the
phase 2 of golden triangle collection
again there's the three different phases
and then also the eye brush set ranging
from 110 to 140 they also did give me a
discount code to use which is Sam 15
I'll have it on the screen here and then
also in the description box down below
now it gives you 15% off the golden and
triangle collections so I will have that
information listed down below in case
you are looking for and you brush that
to get you can get 15% off with that
that is not an affiliate code it is just
a discount of for you guys but I wanted
to go over everything that came in the
set before I start on my face makeup I
just thought this was really cool and I
really enjoyed this case like not only
do I think it's just a nice case in
general like good quality case but I
also like that I can travel with it like
I said I've been trying out these
brushes for the past couple weeks now
and you know of course I would not do a
sponsored video if I didn't stand behind
a product silly enjoy makeup brushes I'm
kind of a makeup brush border but I'm
also kind of a makeup brush snob like if
I don't like brushes I don't like
brushes and I have not found any issues
with these brushes yet I have also
washed them like I said I've washed them
to make them prettier for this video and
then failed but I washed them and they
still look exactly the same as before I
started using them like no shedding
occurred no any like weird mess occurred
I mean you can still see like that looks
like the brush that came brand-new to me
- what my bronzer on it but I was really
impressed with all of that I do really
like the handles as well
because they're kind of just a different
shape and at first I wasn't sure if it
would be easy to get used to because it
just feels different from holding you
know a regular flat all-around type of
brush but I actually kind of really do
like this it took me just you know one
try to get used to it but I really did
like it and one thing I'll say about the
eye brushes as I think that they are
super super soft the face brushes too
but especially on the eyes because if
you use a scratchy brush on your eyes
your eyelids are so soft and kind of
sensitive anyways that I cannot stand
scratchy eye brushes and these eye
brushes in the collection have been very
very soft so I would recommend that the
Delian tools brushes also you will be
seeing in my next favorites video the
brush cleaners and that they have I
mentioned them a while back in a haul
and I said that I was trying them out
but they have a really cool brush
cleaner that comes with the soap and
then also the tin on there is kind of
the style that has like the different
grooves to clean the brushes so it's
really handy and it's also really nice
to travel with like if you're going on
vacation or out of town for quite a few
days it's nice to bring that because
it's really easy and convenient to
travel with and you don't have to worry
about it like opening or spilling
anywhere so I've really been enjoying
that from bdellium tools as well but I
didn't want to go over all of the
brushes in this set and give another
thank you to develop tools for
sponsoring this video
you guys for watching it I'd love to
know if you guys have tried deleon tools
and their brushes yet or any other
products from them and leave some of
your experiences down below because I
know that always helps me out but also
other people reading the comments pretty
good to keep it rolling I am going to
the foundation on I did apply some
primer earlier this is the Charlotte
Tilbury Magica foundation I wanted to
use this one because I did a video a
couple weeks ago and they get ready with
me but I was reviewing a bunch of new
makeup in there but this in there was a
first impression so I've been trying it
out for the past three weeks and I
wanted to come on and give my review of
it I'm going to use the kabuki brush on
here so I'm just going to apply a few
pumps it does have a nice pump on there
and then I'm going to blend this on to
my face so what I will say about this
foundation is I didn't know if I really
loved it at first when I was doing that
video I was kind of on
sure about it but the more I've used it
the more I really do like it
it does say it's a full coverage of
foundation and I mean to me it's like a
medium to full I've tried it with
different primers I've tried it with
different brushes I've tried it with the
beauty sponge and all of that and I
definitely think it's more medium it's
helpful you can build it up but to me
when I think of full coverage I think of
applying it and immediately kind of
having a second skin come over my face
and I don't really see that with this
foundation but that doesn't make me mad
because I actually don't always love
full coverage and it can just be a
little bit too much for me sometimes so
I actually like the coverage of this
foundation I just don't think it is what
it says it's going to be so if you
prefer full coverage you know you'll
just have to be aware that it'll take a
couple passes to get you all the way
built up there but you can even see even
though this is a smaller brush we kind
of worried that I'm gonna be able to
blend it out as quickly it blends out
super super fast so other than that
though I really do like the coverage and
I like the way it looks on my skin I
will say that I like the light Wonder
from Charlotte Tilbury just a little bit
more but I really do like this one I
think that it looks nice the light
Wonder just looks a little bit more
natural on the skin where this one looks
a little bit more like I'm wearing
foundation I do still think it's long
wearing just like the light Wonder is I
can wear it from morning to evening and
it still looks really good it doesn't
make me like overly dewy and it doesn't
make me super mad it just kind of leaves
a nice finish to the skin and then also
I didn't notice it like at any point in
time wearing away funny settling into
lines or anything like that because
sometimes full coverage you can kind of
do that for me but again I don't feel
like this is really truly like full
coverage so I didn't have any sort of
problems with that overall I have really
been liking the foundation I believe
it's in the forty four dollar range
forty to forty four dollars and you do
get to the one fluid ounce of product
again still a nice foundation I just
don't think it's like my absolute
favorite and if you really want to try a
Charlotte Tilbury foundation I would
suggest the like wonder over the magic
foundation but I still really like
and I think it's a nice foundation so I
just wanted to come back and give my
thoughts on the magic of foundation I
like the packaging I like the bottle
it's a nice glass bottle and I do like
that it has a pump to turn into an
absolute favorite I do like applying it
with a brush versus a beauty blender
because I think you can get just a bit
more coverage without having to come in
and use more product to do a second pass
things like that so I would suggest
using a brush with it but yeah overall
that's what I think about the Charlotte
Tilbury
magic foundation has anybody else use
this yeah that is no and I take a quick
break to let my a camera cooled down so
I did just do my brows off camera I used
the Maybelline brow definer I have done
my brows in my last two first impression
Friday videos including one with the
Maybelline brow definer so I have those
that listed down below in case you are
interested but it kind of takes me a
while to do so I figured I would do it
low in from a camera to cool down next
I'm going to come in with concealer I'm
going to use it two at different
concealers I recently bought this one
from colour-pop but the shade is really
really light it's the no filter
concealer it's in light neutral and the
one that I have from L'Oreal and their
Pro Glo infallible concealer is a little
on the dark side so I'm just going to
kind of mix these two together and see
what I think of it so I'm gonna come in
with the L'Oreal first and kind of focus
it on the outer part here and then I'm
going to come in with the color top and
I'm gonna play that out more towards the
Sun or the eyewear I want it to be alive
and up and then I am gonna grab out the
concealer brush from bdellium tools and
just kind of blend and mix these two
together under the eyes again I normally
will not be using this as my like a
regular concealer brush just because I
have other uses I would like it better
for and I like it concealer brushes to
be just a little bit bigger but again
what I found with this one when I was
testing it out is that I feel like it's
really similar to the foundation brush
and what I saw it like I thought it
would be too small and it would take it
too much time but it's actually really
it's pretty quick I mean you can see for
me doing it here it's pretty quick and I
like that I can get right up it here
sometimes I bring my shadows in it too
far and it can make the eye look look a
little bit too dark in there so I
to bring my concealer right up in here
as well and this brush does a good job
for that and it does a good job of
getting right underneath the lashes I
just kind of take what's left over and
push it on to the center I don't always
really highlight it down the center of
my face sometimes I'll just grab what's
left over that I was using and put it on
to the areas in the center of my face
and that's what I'm gonna do today to
contour and bronze I am gonna use the
Kat Von D shade + light a contour
palette this is a little bit newer to me
but I've been trying it out at the past
a few weeks here so I'm gonna use this
shade to contour and then I'm gonna use
a business center shade at - bronze I
did also just do some quick setting
powder onto the concealer to help it
stick around like I said I'm gonna use
the brush that is the precision of
blusher but I like it for contouring so
I'm just going to put that contour shade
on there and then come right underneath
the cheekbones and then I start to blend
it up with contour you always want to
think blending up never down so I'm just
gonna do a little bit down the center of
my nose so again I like how flat it is
here for this purpose I don't always
contour my nose especially if I'm using
a bit of a bigger contour brush and I
just go really light hand it anyways
because I don't really feel like I need
to do a ton of nose contour some day
that might change but so far I don't
hate my nose thus far in my life so I'm
going to use the middle shade and use
the power blending brush again I just
like this as a bronzer so I just kind of
tap the bronzer on there and then slowly
start to blend it I also do some bronzer
on the forehead and to switch back up to
the eyes quick I'm going to take it the
Urban Decay 24/7 glide on pencil
Alyssa's in black I'm gonna use this on
the waterline and then I'm also going to
tightline because I will be doing lashes
and I like tight lining with lashes I
just feel like it helps everything kind
of blend it together
not my lashes off off-camera because
already my camera is overheating this is
what happens when I do longer videos
like this I'm going to use that they
appear diva lashes these are some of my
favorite lashes to do with no liner
looks and especially glitter looks
they're just so like long and wispy and
pretty and beautiful and they are some
of my favorite lashes these are what the
pure diva lashes look like so I'm going
in to pop these on and then you're
almost done with this look
they sell lashes are on so I'm just
gonna finish off the lower lash line and
coming back into the warm of neutrals to
palette and this is where I'm going to
grab out the shade henna it's a little
bit of a darker brown and I'm just going
to use the pencil brush and sweep this
underneath the lash line that is it for
the eyes I know this is more of a chatty
video but really the eyes take me like
10 minutes I'll try to be realistic I
think it takes me like 10 minutes but
super quick and super easy so I'm just
gonna finish off the face I'm going it
to use at the new Urban Decay afterglow
highlight palette I picked this up
during Black Friday and I really have
been finding myself I like mixing the
different shades so I think I'm actually
gonna mix a wicked and then cliche so
I'm gonna put a little bit of a wicked
on first and I'm going to use the
tapered contour brush which I think
makes a really nice highlight brush so
I'm gonna go into a wicked first and
just apply that to the cheekbones I'm
still testing out the palette so my full
review will come in my Black Friday haul
follow-up video I have to say though I'm
not quite as like mmm-mmm about it that
I thought it was going to be again I
still want to try it out before I give
my full review but like I said I feel
like layering works best I'm coming in
with cliche now I feel like layering
works best and I don't feel like you get
the full like impact like highlight
impact that I love on one pass like I
would comparing it to the urban decay in
highlight that I loved so much and I've
been talking about forever and ever I
was hoping that these highlights would
be like that but they're really not you
can build them up and they still look
absolutely gorgeous but they weren't
quite of what I was expecting so really
nice I'm still liking it so far but not
quite the same that
I thought I'm gonna run just a little
bit down the center of my nose no extra
product but just a little down the
center my nose and the tip of my nose
and that's about all I do for my
highlight so there is the urban decay
ons I like palette again my review full
review will be coming soon it's not to
do now is a lip color I'm gonna pull out
they snuggle is real with with lipsticks
set from dose of colors I have used both
of the more pinky tones but I have not
used this more kind of brown a peachy
nude yet which is called a let's cuddle
so I thought it would be perfect for
this one I'm really into pinks lately if
you guys haven't noticed I've been
wearing a love pink a lipsticks in my
video I don't know where that came from
but I want to give this a brown one a
try so let's see what let's cuddle looks
like
so here is a let's cuddle on my lips I
actually like it more than I thought I
was going to it's really really a really
really light nude but I still actually
really like it especially with this
eyelid I think it still looks really
pretty so yeah I'm glad that I like it
as much as I did I love the DOS
lipsticks I mentioned them all the time
I own like 8000 of them so I mean that
might be an exaggeration but I don't
like eight of them that I've purchased
all myself and I just love what the
formula it's one of my favorites so that
is what what was this one called let's
cuddle
