today's video is going to be a get ready
with me and this is actually like my
first get ready with me on my channel
I'm just gonna be doing one of like my
go-to makeup looks that's I've done for
so often like if I can't figure out what
to do this is the look that I go for a
simple easy to do and that's why it's
one of my go-to looks but it is also
going to be a collab video with my
friend Liz Williams here on YouTube I'm
so excited to collab with Liz I love
watching her videos I think she is
fantastic I will leave all the links to
her in the description box below to her
channel and to her Instagram and I
sincerely hope that you will check her
out she has become one of my good
friends here and I love making it new
friendships so I was excited to collab
with her on this get ready with me but
we're also going to make it a storytime
feature we both had kind of been
thinking about doing some sort of a
story time video on our channel but we
weren't quite sure what to do or how to
do it and so we decided to incorporate
it with a get ready with me so that way
we're not just sitting here talking to
you but we're also like doing makeup at
the same time we thought that would be a
fun idea so yeah make sure to check out
Liz's channel below but now why don't we
happen to get ready with me splash story
time I have really large hair right now
yes I know this I had braids in for like
three days but first I'm gonna prime my
face I'm gonna use the makeup forever
step 1 smoothing primer oh the story
that I decided that I'm gonna share with
you guys is how I went from having my
maid of honor be my best friend of 7
years to her completely cutting off all
communication with me just dropping me
like it was hot right after my wedding I
just kind of feel like I I was never
given the opportunity to tell my side of
the story and I just want to be able to
share my side of the story not that I
feel like this girl is going to watch it
all because I can't imagine why she
would or why she would care but I do
have like a life lesson that I learned
out of the entire thing that I want to
share with you guys but I have seen I've
been watching like some more story time
videos and wedding ones they
very popular and especially when it
deals with like friendships I know too
many people who have lost friends in the
wedding process first a little of
different reasons I think I'm the only
one who doesn't actually know why she
lost a friendship which is very weird
but I don't I don't know why that is and
that's very very interesting but also
very very heartbreaking like the number
of times from people that I know in real
life and now people that I'm watching on
YouTube that's are saying that they lost
friendships during a wedding and it's
like why is that so this one is just
like my go-to foundation right now I
can't stop using it it's the true Match
Lumi was my Sigma f80 brush to apply it
obviously I don't want to say my
friend's name so I'm going to use the
name Lainey like a back story Lainey and
I met in college we went to the same
College we lived on the same floor we
became friends that way so we had been
friends for seven years and she was just
my best friend my husband was good
friends with her husband I was a
bridesmaid in her wedding got engaged
she was the first person besides my
family that I called and just a couple
weeks later you know I asked her if she
would be my maid of honor and she said
yes I'm for concealer I'm going to use
the Maybelline fit me concealer I'm
gonna buff that in using the morphe g2
one of my favorite brushes it's excited
she created a Pinterest board for my
wedding and everything was going so
smoothly up until my bachelorette party
so I live in Iowa and for my
bachelorette party I wanted to go to
Kansas City which is just a couple hours
from where I live I wanted to go to
oceans of fun which is like an outdoor
waterpark and then go to the Kansas City
Power and Light District after Laney
also did her bachelorette party there we
went to Worlds of Fun which is like the
amusement part of oceans of fun because
hers was a little bit earlier in the
season so we did the amusement park for
her and did the power light I'm gonna
set my concealer with the Rimmel stay
matte and my ELF small tapered brush the
morning that we met for the bachelorette
party I kind of thought that Laney was
kind of acting just kind of off like she
was just kind of acting a little bit
different to me
I actually wrote in a separate car to
Kansas City from her so I wasn't really
able to talk to her like
Gager at all and then when we got to
owns of fun we immediately went to like
the adult pool and I got drinks and we
were just kind of laying around but like
I didn't go to oceans of fun for my
bachelorette party to sit in a pool like
I wanted long rides I want to go on the
slides like yeah I'm 29 years old but
I'm like a teenager at heart like I love
that kind of stuff I love amusement
parks and love water parks like I wanted
to go ride the rides and so I was
telling some of my friends like you know
hi when are we gonna go do that and you
know a handful of them were like yeah
you know let's go do it right now
and tulane II I was like hey we're gonna
go ride the rides and she looked at me
and she goes I am net riding rides and I
was like oh okay I mean it's my
bachelorette party that's kind of weird
right like if I'm like hey I want to go
do this and I want the group to do this
shouldn't my maid-of-honor be the first
one that's like heck yeah let's go let's
get my for the slide like what are we
doing like let's let's go I was like
okay so actually half the group stayed
back with her at the pool and then the
other half came with me and we did like
with the rides and stuff and it was a
lot of fun but I was really like hurt at
that point like why would she not want
to do this with me does she not want to
go here like at her bachelorette party
when she was like here when I go on
these rides I wasn't like mmm no I'm not
gonna do that and I wasn't even her maid
of honor like I don't know it was just
it was very very bizarre for my eyes I'm
gonna be using makeup geek shadows but
the first color that might use is right
here it's peach smoothie I'm gonna use
my morphe m43 3 and I'm just gonna apply
this into the crease you know I thought
that was weird but the group of us that
went on the rides we came back and Lanie
appeared to be like flirting with a guy
at the pool which I'm like okay no big
deal I mean you know you're married but
like whatever we're not dead even if
we're married I'm like if she didn't go
with me on the rides because she wanted
to sit back and like talk to guys that's
really weird and that's really
inconsiderate that's not who she is so I
was just like super super confused and
so I'm upset
point but like okay what can I do we
leave and we get to the hotel
where we're gonna be staying and we
start like getting ready for the night
and stuff and she is just acting like
she doesn't want anything to do with me
she's not talking to me she's not asking
me if like I need anything my sisters
were there trying to help me out my best
friend Holly was there who was another
bridesmaid and she was trying to like
run the show I felt so bad for her and I
was like okay let's open gifts or hey
here's the stuff that we got you you
know like a tiny hat that said
bride-to-be and here's your sash and I'm
like what is going on and even my
sisters were like is something wrong
with Lanie and I'm like you know I'm not
sure but I'm gonna try to find out and
so when we went to dinner as we were
walking to dinner I kind of pulled her
aside and I just said you know hey is
everything okay and she looked at me
like I was dumb and was like yeah I'm
like well you're just acting kind of
weird like I just wanted to make sure
everything was okay if there's you know
any issues like let's work it out now
and she's like no everything's fine I'm
just hungry okay so we get to dinner she
doesn't sit by me but you know no big
deal whatever we're playing games she
won't participate in the games we're
taking photos she won't take photos I'm
like this is a bat my best friend I
don't know what she's doing but she's
really really hurting my feelings right
now the night continues to progress
she isn't by me at all there was a point
in the night where a guy came up and he
was like hey I'm with a bachelor party
and we want you to take like a shot with
the bachelor and I'm like oh okay
and I have like a drink in my hand I
have a clutch and I'm like looking
around for someone to grab it he goes
where's your maid of honor and I looked
around I was like um I actually I don't
know and he goes and then she's supposed
to be by your side I was like yeah
that's weird right like if you look back
at the pictures from my bachelorette
party she's in two of them I think and
they're both like staged group shots but
once we actually get out to the Power
and Light District when we start going
around at different bars she's not in
any of those photos most of the time I
didn't even know where she was she just
kept going off and disappearing by
herself I mean what so now I'm going to
use the shade
Coco bear on my morphe m-44 one brush
and I'm just going to place that into
the crease as well just to kind of
darken everything up I'm upset I'm upset
at my bachelorette party I don't know
what to do my best friend is ignoring me
she's ignoring the other guests she
clearly is not giving a hoot about me
and it's bizarre I'm trying not to let
my emotions show too much because I have
you know other girls there that are
trying so hard to make sure I'm having a
good time and I'm trying not to like
ruin it for everyone
but then someone comes up to me and says
hey we just saw Laney do a shot with the
bartender from an unmarked bottle like
he pulled a bottle out from under the
bar it had no label on it no nothing on
it and only she took a shot from it I
mean where does your mind go it goes -
she just ingested something that could
be harmful to her don't know what to do
you know she keeps disappearing anyways
what are we supposed to do with her and
I'm like guys I don't I don't know what
to do she's she's ruining my night I
don't know why she's doing this I don't
know why she's acting this but I've
never seen her act that way in our seven
years of friendship never seen anything
like it
except for the night of my bachelorette
party and so my sister is like you know
I think she does need to go back to the
hotel I don't know what she just took
but in case it was something you know we
can't risk her you know whatever and I'm
like okay that's fine so I leave at one
point I leave my bachelorette party
there was a couple other girlfriends
that were down there for a concert and
they said that they were going to a
different bar and I was like you know
what I'm gonna go with them and I went
with them and no one else when my
bachelorette party followed me or even
noticed I was gone because they were all
too concerned with Lainey and what she
had possibly just taken and trying to
get her to leave the bar no one noticed
that the Bachelorette left her party
because my maid of honor was causing
such a scene like seriously seriously
finally meet up again and now my sister
my sister-in-law
is basically in an argument with my maid
of honor and I had said hey I want to go
to this bar and my maid of honor said I
want to go over here and my sister said
well I think we should go to this bar
because Samantha wants to be there and
Laney snapped at her yelled at her and
the look on my sister's face was like oh
hell no and that was when the other
girls were like you need to leave like
you just you need to leave you're cut
off you need to leave you're being
belligerent now you're just being rude
to family like you gotta go
so another girl ended up taking her back
to the hotel and we tried to you know
continue on our night and have fun but I
was like who does that who acts that way
at anybody's bachelorette party
whether it be your best friend whether
it be a family member whether it just be
a friend of yours who acts that way and
a bachelorette party
blew my mind we continue on with the
night the next morning comes we stop for
breakfast my maid of honor won't look at
me she won't talk to me she won't say
anything to me and I'm like you got to
be kidding me I don't even get an
apology I don't even get anything from
her like what and you know in the car
ride home we just talked about it a
little bit but I think one of those
friends said something to her like hey I
think you need to reach out like your
behavior was kind of weird last night
and she sent me a text message that day
and you know it was like I don't know
what happened last night but I hope
you're not mad at me and I can't imagine
not having you in my life and I'm like
okay so at this point where I really for
three weeks away it's my wedding and I'm
like okay what am I supposed to do
like you know prolong this fight or just
get over it you know what do I do and so
I was like well let's just have lunch
and like try to talk it out you know
whatever we all have bad nights that
sucks that you picked my bachelorette
party to have the worst night of your
life that I have ever seen but whatever
let's talk about it so we had lunch and
we try to talk about it and what she
said to me was I just forgot it was your
bachelorette party I just thought it was
a girls night out
you planned my bachelorette party you
booked the hotels you made the Facebook
group you invited people how did you
forget it was my Bachelorette
I had a goddamn sex on with a tiny hat
on my head that said bride-to-be how did
you forget it was my bachelor party I'm
stressed enough that's three weeks to my
wedding I was feeling very overwhelmed a
lot of different feelings you know go on
when you're gonna get married anyways
and then the stress of trying to put
everything together and now I got this
situation going on and I'm like you know
what whatever let's just forget about it
we've been friends for seven years we've
been through good and bad together yes
this sucked this sucked a lot this
really deeply hurt me that you would
behave like that and that you would
treat my family the way you did but
let's just move on let's just forget
about it after that situation happened
and I thought things would be okay you
know whatever we're gonna move on
everything's gonna be fine I think the
situation is gonna be okay and then she
just starts not caring at all about the
wedding plans she says that she can't
come to certain dress appointments with
me she had a job to like make us live
shell for us at the last minute she was
like oh I actually can't make that and
me and my husband were scrambling trying
to make this slide show she even said at
one point she didn't think she could
make the rehearsal dinner because she
couldn't get off work and I'm just
thinking to myself like what are you
talking about like gonna pick up a
little bit of Biton which is a really
cool like reddish shade and my Sigma e25
brush and I'm just gonna kind of like
delicately place this into the outer V
happening and I'm starting to freak out
like she all of a sudden doesn't care
about wedding plans
she's flaking out on me I don't know
what to do you know I thought we talked
to us through but apparently I was wrong
like what am I supposed to do and my mom
was like you need to not have her as
your maid of honor is she even gonna
show up on your wedding day I'm like I
have no idea the programs have already
been printed obviously we're now we're
two weeks away I don't have time for
someone else to go buy a dress to match
everybody like what am I supposed to do
so we just left it you know the wedding
day came and went and
it was fine I mean honestly your wedding
day is one of the most overwhelming
does--he for your life I really don't
remember a whole lot from it it went by
so fast you know it was such a blur but
it was a lot of fun she gave a nice
speech
you know everything seemed okay to me
it'll hurt that she didn't like spend
the night at the location we weren't too
far out of town but you know everyone
kind of like got together the next
morning but my maid of honor is not
there because she couldn't find someone
to watch her dogs I mean I had a
13-month engagement my wedding date was
always out there like you couldn't find
someone to watch your dogs on my wedding
day really but okay
and then after that I would text her and
call her she never once insert any of my
calls her text messages I think maybe
she answered like three of my text
messages but it was always like
something very short and brief and if it
was ever like hey you want to get
together it was a no and you know I
started getting more aggressive in my
text as the time went by like hey I you
know feel like something's wrong here
you want to get together and talk about
it and I would either just be ignored
all right get an O and then on Christmas
Day I realized that she unfriended me on
Facebook and I was like are you serious
right now
so I sent her a message it was just like
see we're not friends on Facebook
anymore
like are you ever gonna give me an idea
of what happened and why you're so mad
at me or give me a chance to explain if
I need to explain something like what's
going on and her response was basically
she was sorry that she unfriended me and
she did it like the heat of the moment
she's not really emotionally to talk to
me but she hopes that I have a nice life
and I'm like okay and I'm trying to
write back and I'm saying I don't know
what it is that I did like I thought I
was being the bigger person after my
Bachelorette pretty to be like okay
let's put this behind us but you're
still dragging this out and I don't
actually know what happened here like
you get that right and her responses
back to me were so mean and so cruel and
I don't know why like even now
spend almost three years and people are
still like hey did you ever find out
what you and Laney aren't friends
anymore and I'm like nope never figured
that out for me to be cut out of
someone's life who'd been my best friend
for seven years in my opinion I would
have to do something incredibly horrible
for that to happen I would the only two
things I could come up with if I could
have done was like slept with her
husband or killed her dog promise you
that I did not do those things so I
don't know what it is that I could have
possibly done to someone to deserve what
she did to me I don't know what I did to
deserve how she treated me and my
friends and my family I my bachelor
party and I don't know what I did to
deserve the way that she treated me
after my wedding and one thing that I
tried to say my message is to err was do
you know how hard it is to look at my
wedding photos and see you next to me
and all of these photos like I don't
even want to put my wedding from his up
around my house because I have this
reminder of hey this was my best friend
the girl that I asked to be my right arm
and my wedding and she just cut me out
of her life like it meant absolutely
nothing to her and her response back to
that was your wedding day has nothing to
do with this and our situation shouldn't
take away from your wedding but it's
like do you not understand do you not
get what you did do you not get this I
do not understand how she does not get
this this shade right here which is
shimma shimma really these shimmery
shade on my Sigma II 54 and I'm just
gonna dust that on to the inner part of
my eyes it hurt me and you know I would
talk to my husband and I talked to my
friends and they would just say like
don't give up you know keep trying to
message her one of these days she's
gonna talk to you like whatever she's
mad about it she's gonna have to to talk
to you about it and I'm like okay
so I don't give up I keep messaging her
texting her I'm getting nothing back I'm
getting nothing back and I won't kind of
got frustrated like what is her husband
saying and what are her other friends
saying like oh no just ignore her it's
cool like what is the Maybelline master
precise liner in black one of my
favorite liners and just making pretty
simple wings one time or I messaged her
and she agreed to meet with me and I was
getting ready to go on my honeymoon so I
went a few months later and so I said
how about after my honeymoon I let you
know when I'm back and then we can plan
something and she said yes I sent her an
email when I was back and
do any of these dates work she did not
respond I was in about two weeks of that
both of us went to a bachelorette party
for a friend and while there I went up
to her and I just said you know hey do
you want to still get together and she
just freaked out on me like freaked out
on me I mean she was yelling at me and
she was causing a scene and I was like
you've got to be kidding me I don't know
what your problem is like all I did was
ask you if you still wanted to get
together like you would said you did in
your last message and she was just
yelling and screaming and I was so
embarrassed and I was embarrassed for
the Bachelorette cuz I'm like don't you
dare cause a scene at someone else's
bachelor party it is so disrespectful
like you already did it once let's get
it together and I just was like oh guy
like I'm not even gonna deal with you
once again you're super drunk at a
bachelorette party I'm sober like let's
just not even do this and we went
outside and we were going to like a
different place to get food and we're
all walking together as a group of
people walking together and she happens
to be walking in front of me and she
turns around and yells at me why are you
following me and I'm like cuz we're all
going to coaches pizza and she just
turned around was like oh oh I'm like oh
my word needless to say after that like
I really didn't want anything to do with
I was like I don't know who would treat
a friend this way I just keep going back
to that who treats a friend that way and
who when a friend is saying hey I
honestly scouts honor don't know what's
going on
can you please fill me in and for them
to basically do the whole you know what
you did no I don't because why would I
keep asking you if I knew what I did I
would not do that like this is annoying
three years later I wouldn't still be
talking about it and being like me and I
wondered what it was and I did to that
chick I just can't figure it out but
line my waterline I'm gonna come in it
with the Maybelline skinny pencil and
still really really bothers me my 36
brush from morphe I'm gonna pick up some
Coco bear first and run that on the
lower lash line right before my two-year
wedding anniversary so last year
September that I actually reached out to
her on Facebook again and just said hey
no time has passed but maybe now you
know things will calm down would you
like to grab a coffee sometime and maybe
talk about what happened because I still
don't know what exactly happened and
what made me lose this friendship and I
you know would still like an explanation
and she wrote back and said no she
didn't think it was worth that too much
time had passed and wasn't worth it
a hard feeling to put yourself out there
and be rejected especially by someone
that you love and that you respect it
for so many years that was very
confusing and so after that I'm like you
know what I just can't do it anymore
like my husband my family my friends are
still saying like maybe one day like
don't give up
maybe next year try again and I'm like
what's the what's the point like because
I know I no longer think that she's not
only a good friend but I no longer think
that she's a good person good people
don't treat people like how she treated
me and knowing knowing myself that I
actually did not do anything to her to
deserve that makes her not a good person
in my book and makes her not someone
that I would want to be friends with
anymore
there's anything that I want to say is
that be mindful of the way that you
treat other people I mean it taught me
that when I'm going through something
you know the best thing to do is talk it
out with someone because clearly there
was some sort of miscommunication
somewhere with us and I don't know where
it was and so you know that would be my
advice was just try to communicate with
people but if they're not good for you
cut them out of your life because you
don't need that so next I'm gonna pick
up a little bit of bitten and put that
in the lower lashline as well another
lesson that I learned out of all of this
is that it's really sad to me but this
whole situation took away a lot of my
self-confidence and it made me doubt a
lot of things about myself literally
just driving me insane I mean it truly
was driving me crazy
that I could not think of what I would I
could have done to this person to make
them treat me the way that they did but
I also lost a lot of self confidence in
myself and I also forgot how to stand up
for myself when I would have problems
but even family members are close
friends like when we would get in fights
I would not say my piece I would just I
would just hunker down and I would take
it and I had a friend who just went off
on me one time and called me the worst
names and I sat there and I took it
because I was like what if I tried to
fight back for myself then I'm gonna
lose another friend and I just sat there
and I took being called some of the
worst names and I took it because my
friend my maid of honor
completely shook my confidence in myself
and if there's one thing that I just
want to like tell you guys is don't lose
that because that was the day that I
realized how much it affected so many
more areas in my life than just like
losing a friendship but it really had a
deep effect on me as a person and that's
when I got even more upset and was like
I I cannot let people treat me like this
I can't be treated as a doormat because
now I'm so afraid that any little thing
that I do I'm just gonna lose friends
left and right like that's not fair to
me so that was that was a really
eye-opening day and it's what kind of
made me you know change the way that I
thought and you know just think you
can't let this go on you can't let this
affect your life the way that you've
been letting it affect you like losing a
friendship like that I think is really
really hard to me I consider it like a
breakup you know I was with this person
for seven years she knows things about
me that I would never tell anyone else
lose that one day with no explanation
and no reasoning
I'm not even get to say goodbye it's
really hard finish up the Facebook and
use the Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer and my morphe and the five-30
brush they're just some of my lessons
like whatever story time I decide I want
to tell you guys if you guys do want to
see more story times you know I don't
want to just sit here and tell a story I
wanted to somehow reflect on a lesson
that I learned and hopefully I can bring
back to you that's exactly what I do in
all of my books I just always want there
to be some story some lesson that I
passed on that I have learned but it is
you know obviously the first one is
don't treat your friends like I
mean that's that's a good start don't do
that and if you do just say you're sorry
apologize move on you know I mean people
make mistakes people have bad nights
people have bad days people have bad
weeks like if you can't trust your
friends to be like you know what you
acted crazy that night but whatever I
know you're a good person let's move on
like I didn't get that with my friend
I got you did something that I can't
even tell you what it is that you did
and now I'm just gonna destroy our
friendship like that's completely not
fair thing is that even if these things
happen to you in life you cannot let it
get you down you cannot let it seemingly
destroy you like I almost let it destroy
me you can't let people shake your
self-confidence that much those are just
a few things that I want it to take away
from this story unless I'm going to use
the wet-and-wild might I buy you a drink
and the morphe m42 seven right I'm gonna
do just a light dusting of opal from
Becca cosmetics on my morphe M 501 brush
that is just basically my first story
time video I hope you guys enjoyed that
I hope it isn't like too too long of a
video no it's not like a happy story or
anything but it wasn't anything like too
crazy I didn't think but I don't know I
just wanted to share that story with you
guys since it seems like wedding stories
and kind of like bridesmaids gone rogue
seems to be a popular subject around
here but to finish off my eyes I'm going
to use the Smashbox x-rated mascara if
you guys didn't like the story time
video please do leave that in the
comments below I really have no idea
like how this video will be received but
if you like it and if you do want on
their stories just please leave that in
the comments below play I didn't like be
a debbie downer or anything I just
wanted to kind of share that with you
guys I know I got emotional once but it
just is because you know even though
it's something that happened three years
ago it obviously had a very profound
effect on my life and I'm just an
emotional person so I can't really help
that one of the most confusing parts to
me is that how did she cut me out of her
life without caring at all like it was
like she gave no thought to it she just
one day I was like we're not friends
anymore and it really made
questioned our entire friendship it
really made me question if our
friendship was ever as strong as I
always thought that it was truly not
care about our friendship in the way
that I cared about our friendship for
seven years and I think that's just one
thing that like really really trips me
up is does she miss me did she miss me
I'm not sure this color is gonna exactly
go with the scheme but I got these new
colored jewels from Maybelline and I
want to try this one out this is an
orange outburst isn't that really good
for summer mm-hmm I'm really liking this
I don't have any orange in my collection

my get ready with me slash a story time

I did you guys enjoyed the story time

not the only one out there that's just
been a completely dumped by a friend let

was a little bit worried about opening
and opening up this was such a personal
story with you guys but I feel more
confident now and that's because of the
