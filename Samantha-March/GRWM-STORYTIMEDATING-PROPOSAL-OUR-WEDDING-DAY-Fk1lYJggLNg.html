today's video is going to be a get ready
with me plus a story time I did one of
these videos a couple months back and it
seemed to go over pretty well and in
that video I asked if you guys would
want to see another get ready with me
with a story time included in there a
lot of people said yes and I also asked
what story time would you like to see
and so many of you guys are very curious
about my husband you wanted to hear the
story of how I met you wanted to tear
the story of how he proposed to me you
wanted to hear little pit bits from our
wedding and so I thought why not give it
a shot I know that I can talk a lot so I
kind of want to cover how we met how we
proposed and our wedding but not make
this video in our long so this is also
going to be a bit of a challenge for me
but I'm gonna try to get through it and
cover all those bases all while doing my
makeup at the same time so we shall see
how this video goes but since I know
it's gonna be a long one let's just hop
right into it my hair back you can see
my sports bra okay then so I really
wanted to use the Kat Von D shade +
light eyeshadow palette so that's what
I'm going to use today so I'm gonna do
my eyes first but before I do anything
it is early morning I just woke up a few
hours ago and I need to like set myself
up so I'm gonna spray my face real quick
with the Mario Badescu rose water spray
just give me a little hydration that's
good stuff okay and then since I'm gonna
work with the eyes first I'm gonna take
a little bit of my Maybelline fit me
concealer and place that on my eyelids
to act as a eye primer and then both
that end with my Sephora 57 brush so my
husband's name is Mitch we will be
married for three years on September 7th
we met in college so we went to the same
college in Des Moines Iowa which is
where we still live now I am a year
older than Mitch yes I am and our
birthdays are four days apart but my
birthday is first so after my birthday
it for those four days I'm technically
two years older than him and those are
like the worst four days of my life you
guys at the worst four days he reminds
me every single day for those four days
so I'm two years older than him
but we didn't start dating right away
when he came to college like we all hung
out in the same circle and you know went
to the same parties and games and
activities and whatnot but we didn't
start dating until that following spring
and we will be dating 10 years next
April that's a long time the first date
I'm going to take out of the pallet is
this like peachy one right here and I'm
gonna use that in my crease and a little
bit above using the morphe m4 for one
brush so we started dating in the spring
and then it was probably what like four
years into dating that we moved in
together we moved into a condo and then
we lived in the condo I think for three
years and then we bought our first house
in May before we got married so we got
married in September and we bought our
first house in May and this is where we
still live so it's been very exciting we
got married September 7th and then we
welcomed Aries our puppy who I'm sure
many of you guys have seen and know we
welcomed her in November after that year
so that was very exciting I mean that's
really how we met our first date like
our first like time that we really like
spend time together in like any sort of
flirty way was that his apartment on
campus and we watched Teledyne i'ts so
that you get my babe and then our first
date we went to Applebee's
I love Applebee's which also has a
reference until Digga nights are just
kind of funny now the reason why we
chose it was just something close and
like when you're in college
Applebee's I think it's considered fancy
like right pick up this gray shade right
here and use my morphe m4 3:3 and just
kind of place that like on the outer V
and then slowly blend it in so it was
really exciting moving in together
remember exactly how old we were when we
finally decided to move in together we
were both out of college at this point
exciting to purchase our first home
together
very stressful you know I watched those
HGTV shows and they talked about buying
a house and they make it seem like
super super easy that was not easy
buying a house like I really am hesitant
to do this process again especially now
that we would have to sell a house at
the same time because it wasn't much
harder than I imagined
but so we started dating in 2007 and
then it was July 26th of 2012 we were
living in our condo together and Mitch
asked to me it was a Thursday night he
asked if I wanted to go out to dinner
that night and I was like well heck yeah
and I says there anywhere that you want
to go and he was like thinking about
doing something different we went to
spaghetti works which is a restaurant
downtown Des Moines and we usually don't
venture downtown it's a longer drive
it's like kind of a pain to park we just
don't do it a lot but I was like yeah
that's a good idea like every once in a
while we would try to go out of our
comfort zone and like eat somewhere else
you know go somewhere different like try
to have fun with it so I at this point
suspect it nothing and we went to leave
and I worked from home at this point and
so I was always wearing like yoga pants
and just like workout clothes and I
remember I had like a t-shirt and yoga
pants on and I was getting ready to
leave and I was like you know what I'm
just gonna put a dress on because we
never do anything like nice or like out
of the box like I always wear yoga
clothes like just put something better
on so I just put like a very simple like
black and white dress on it wasn't
anything fancy it wasn't anything crazy
I wore you know nicer flip-flops with it
but I was like I'm just gonna throw a
dress on so we make it down to spaghetti
works and we start eating and I realize
at one point that Mitch hasn't eaten all
of his food and usually when Mitch eats
not only does he eat all his food but a
lot of times he's like taking food off
my plate and I asked him at one point is
that do you like your food and he's like
oh yeah yeah it's fine
okay still do not suspect anything
at this point like I'm like oh okay
whatever so we keep eating and then we
go to leave and he's like oh do you want
to stop in at Johnny's and get a drink
and Johnny's does like a bar and your
spaghetti works like a sports bar and
I'm like okay which was kind of weird to
me cuz usually like we dinner we go home
I don't usually stop to drink I'm
big drinker especially like during the
week because I work from home so I can
always be working and so I get
frustrated if I'm not in the right state
to be working because then I go home and
I'm like I could be working obviously I
don't want to write a book or edit a
book or answer playing emails if I've
been drinking so but I was like okay you
know I want to stop in and get a drink
like sure that's fine we stopped in to
Johnny's and we get drinks and and at
one point he goes with the bathroom and
he's in the bathroom for a long time I'm
like what in the world is going on and
he finally comes out and like everything
okay and he's like yeah I'm like okay
still at this point not suspecting
anything like I don't know like looking
back I'm like Smith that there was so
many clues there for you and I realized
none of them so then we leave Johnny's
and he's like oh would you want to walk
on there's like a pedestrian bridge near
the area that we works it's really cool
really fancy just looks really nice and
he's like would you want to take a walk
on the bridge and I'm like okay sure
and so we're walking along the bridge
and at one point there's like little
areas in the bridge where you can like
look down and see the river below
there's one point he's like trying to
point something out to me I don't even
remember what it was but he was getting
my attention to look this way and when I
turned back around he was down on one
knee and asked me to marry him and and
it was very sweet I was very surprised I
was very I was very taken off-guard but
I did manage to say yes and I'm very
cool it was it was such a special moment
obviously one I will remember my entire
life but he puts so much you know plan
and consideration and thought into the
proposal and that just makes you know
that just makes a girl feel so special
it really does brown shade with my Sigma
II 39 and just kind of like buff that
and see what we all got going on and
kind of blend it in a little bit after
the proposal we found someone on the
bridge to take our photo which I'll try
to insert over here I called my mom
and we are a military family I'm trying
to think worth they were even loving at
that time I think they were in El Paso
Texas so I call my mom right away and
she answers the phone and she's like yes
and I'm like wait did you know and Mitch
had called her ahead of time and asked
for her permission to ask me to marry
him which was awesome I do not have a
father I just have my mom so I just
thought that was really really sweet
that he also considered calling my mom
and getting her permission and her
blessing and that was that was really
really special so I was able to talk to
my mom and to my sister and they were so
excited and then we called Mitch's
family as well and his siblings and I
remember calling my little brother and I
think it was like his girlfriend at the
time answered the phone and I was like
can I talk to John and she was like oh
he's he's on the slowpitch field like he
was playing softball or something and I
was like kid you tell him to call me
right away because we didn't want to
start telling friends until we had
gotten ahold of all of our family
members and then we wanted to tell our
close friends and then we finally posted
it on Facebook but yeah it's definitely
really hard these days like making the
rounds with such exciting news and then
having to tell people like but please
don't say anything yet like we're trying
to make sure that we get everyone told
before anyone would see it on social
media especially like the proposal was
like one of the most romantic nights of
my life obviously one of the most
special and it just made me feel so
loved that he puts so much time and
effort and consideration into it thought
about our fee and I thought about my mom
like it just it really doesn't get any
better than that
and I realized afterwards that he didn't
have it in the plans to stop at
Johnnie's to get the drink but he did it
because he wanted to propose right at
sunset and so he had looked to see you
know like how they predict like when the
Sun will set so you knew what time it
was going to be so he had tried to time
it out but the Sun wasn't setting yet so
that's why he stalled us with the drinks
at Johnny's so he could propose on the
bridge at sunset it was the coolest
thing it was it was really really the
coolest thing so so
very special we did end up taking a few
of our engagement pictures on that
bridge as well it's just such a cool
location so I'll try to add a few of
those pictures in here as well so yeah
the proposal was amazing and then you
know of course we hopped into wedding
planning and honestly wedding planning
was a little bit more stressful than I
thought maybe it would be there's just
so many different opinions and so many
people want to help you which is amazing
definitely not complaining there but so
many people want to help you and give
their feedback but then it almost can
kind of get to be too much and kind of
overwhelming and yeah and I think it was
harder with my family being out of town
and trying to keep them in the loop and
make sure that they you know felt a part
of it my mom was amazing she came back a
couple different times during the
wedding planning process to help me out
here and to just be able to see things I
first tried on wedding dresses I knew
that I wanted to try on my first wedding
dress with my mom like it didn't matter
I wanted to try on my first wedding
dress with my mom so we got engaged in
July I think it was September and that
mentioned I went to I'm pretty sure with
Texas at the time out Paso Texas we went
to Texas to visit the family and then me
my mom my sister and my niece
we went wedding-dress shopping down
there and you know I did not think that
I was going to buy a wedding dress down
there because how would I get it back
home to me and you know all that stuff
but I just wanted to make sure the very
first time I put a dress on but my mom
was good to see it so that was a really
cool experience I'm so grateful that we
did that like so grateful that we did
that we went to a couple different
stores I tried on a lot of dresses and
it was a really really fun experience
and end up buying my dress back here I
had my maid of honor and my bridesmaid
Holly
they came with me to look at dresses and
try them on and then we Skyped with my
mom and my sister the whole process so
they could see the dresses so on that
appointment I did end up buying my
wedding dress which I absolutely loved I
actually saw it online first and I was
like that is the dress I want and it
took us forever to find it like no
places have it or they didn't have the
they didn't have that dress and actually
the store that I bought it from they
didn't have that specific dress because
this dress from Maggie Sottero was the
designer it was called Perla they had
two different designs of Perla so
basically the same dress but the one I
had in the store had like like full up
to the neck it had long sleeves it
didn't have a corset back it was
different but then the other design of
Perla was strapless and had a corset
back and so there was just little
changes with it and that was the one I
saw online that I really wanted and the
store was like we can order this dress
but we can order it and the different
you know the one that you want so I
tried on what they had and I was like
yes like I know that this is the one
that I want I loved the very very full
skirt hoop skirt like ultimate princess
just for me I was like I know this is
what I want so it was a little scary
ordering a dress that technically I did
not try on that was a little scary and
when the dress did come in we ordered it
in like October it came in in March and
my mom was up here which is really nice
she came to visit and so when I tried
off that dress for the first time my mom
was there and got to see me in it and so
special so awesome I absolutely loved it
I loved everything about my dress it was
perfect
it was big it was princessy it was
sparkly it was blingy it was also a
little bit sheer and it just it just
spoke to me I think a lot of people
thought maybe I was going to pick a
wedding dress that was very form-fitting
because that's kind of more like the
clothing style
I wear kind of like a tighter clothing
but on my wedding day I wanted to be a
princess and I was it did have her sheer
bodice though and I couldn't wear
underwear because you could see through
it so that was my that was my touch that
was my Samantha touch I still needed a
little bit of me in there but I wanted
to be a princess at the same time you
know don't say I pick up this white
shade and use my Sigma II 54 and just
sweep that across the lid to give a
little bit of brightness to the look so
that was picking out my wedding dress
that actually went really smoothly and
most of the wedding plans went smoothly
we have two for
that are getting married here shortly
and going you know through their wedding
plans and my husband actually asked me
the other day like if you could change
anything about when we were planning our
wedding like what would you change and I
really couldn't think of anything I wish
that I would have listened to myself
more instead of everybody else's
opinions and really trying to make
everybody else happy there were certain
things that we did or didn't do that we
did because someone else wanted it or
someone else thought we should have it
that way you know what I mean and I was
like yeah okay yeah like need to please
everybody that was kind of like the role
I felt like I took on and I wish I would
have listened to myself more and been
like you know what that's what I wanted
I shoulda done it that way but you know
it's it can't it can be very
overwhelming and very stressful and it
happens but really everything I was very
happy with our families were incredibly
fantastic my family but also Mitch's
family were so incredibly helpful not
just his parents but like his sister was
so helpful as well mr. knob made me such
a great little charm show you guys my
bouquet she made a charm with my
grandparents wedding photo on there and
put it in there which was so special to
me like everyone just was very very
helpful and I'm so grateful because
really are our wedding day went very
very smoothly there was a glitches of
course there was there was like little
issues you know dotted along throughout
the day but nothing major
nothing nothing devastating nothing you
know I'm nothing crazy like that it all
went very very smoothly and you know
it's because our families were such a
huge help so yeah they were awesome I'm
gonna switch to my face real quick for
primarily use the makeup forever step
one smoothing primer like I said our
wedding day honestly it went very
smoothly
there was a few hiccups like the deejay
playing here comes the bride and the
wedding party walked down the aisle for
foundation I'm gonna take it back back
to like my favorite from last year's the
Maybelline fit me in 225 I'm just gonna
put some on my Real Techniques sponge
and blend that across my face it was
also really special like I mentioned I
do not have a father I've actually
thought about doing a story time video
on that because my biological
there is a sperm donor and I've kind of
played with the idea of like trying to
find him one day but I I don't I don't
know I don't talk about it a whole lot
but I thought maybe it might be an
interesting video you guys would want to
hear the story about like how my mom had
me and how I found out about it because
I actually did not learn until I was 23
I have an interesting story along those
lines but if you guys would like to hear
that story at all or any other story ten
videos just please leave that in the
comments below and I will make a note of
that everything else about the wedding
went very smoothly and if you watch my
other get ready with me you'll know that
my maid of honor got me out of her life
after my wedding and I've never quite
figured out why so I will leave that
little video link down below if you
would like to see that it's also really
special to me too because since I don't
have a father I am very close with my
little brother and I asked him to walk
me down the aisle and he did and that
was a really really special moment it
was a lot of fun and something that I'll
always remember
and you know Mitch did like the dance
with his mom at the wedding and I danced
with John and it was very sweet and he
was such a good brother like if I needed
anything from Jonathan during that year
like he was on it like he had my back so
much he was constantly texting me like
do you need anything do you need me to
come down for anything like when do you
need me to get there and he just he he
really took it seriously and you know he
was only in like his early 20s at this
point and it just it meant a lot to me
um just really how much he cared and
showed that he cared during the wedding
goes it was really awesome hey you know
I've heard a lot of people say like your
wedding can be like one of the most
overwhelming days of your life like the
fastest day ever and it's so true
because there are times from our wedding
that are a complete blank to me like
people will tell a story that I'm a part
of and I'm like I don't remember that at
all like isn't that weird I'm gonna come
back in with the maybelline fit me
concealer to conceal under my eyes it
flew by in a blur I've also never been
as exhausted as I was like I could not
sleep the night before I had a lot of
troubles sleeping obviously but by the
time that our wedding got over
I can remember like getting back to
hotel and falling face-first dress still
on hair still done every like shoes
still on I remember falling face-first
into the bed and just being like I'm
exhausted
like the level of exhaustion in my body
that night was insane like just insane
but all totally worth it all so much fun
honestly I've heard brights day like I
wish I could do my wedding again like I
want to be a bride again and I'm like no
I'm good
like it was stressful it was exhausting
like was it all worth it yes what do I
want to do it again like no no I'm good
actually thanks like thing and it that's
so expensive like let's not forget that
part
it is very pricey to get married with in
Iowa which means we have really really
brutal winters so we actually decided to
wait and take our honeymoon in February
and we went to st. Lucia for our
honeymoon we went to a sandals in st.
Lucia and it was a really awesome
experience I'm really glad that we
waited because we were able to kind of
get out of like when February comes it's
like winter has those in its clutches
and it's not letting go and it just can
be so tiring so tiring like I just I'm
not a winter person so I think we made a
good decision in waiting and also a lot
of people I've heard them say like it's
really exhausting to go from like
boom-boom-boom wedding wedding wedding
to like all of a sudden like relaxation
but you're still like coming down from
the wedding there's still things that
you need to do and worry about after the
wedding that it's kind of hard to enjoy
your honeymoon right afterwards so I'm
really glad we waited all the craziness
had gone down like our thank yous I've
gone out my dress was cleaned and boxed
and I mean that everything was put back
together it was all good so I'm glad we
waited we had a really great honeymoon
that's that the concealer with the
Rimmel stay matte and using my new Real
Techniques deluxe concealer brush I'm
really loving on this brush so I'm just
going to set everything with this think
that actually like probably wraps up the
story I was trying to make it as fast as
I could just gonna do a quick bronze of
the skin with the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer in my morphe and five-30
brush nothing too crazy here
also I know a few people on snapchat
have requested like the husband tag
video where we would do a video together
and like answer a couple questions maybe
you guys wanted to see that leave that
in the comments below because then I
could actually show Mitch because I
don't think he believes me when I say
that people want to see him cuz he said
they get when he was like they're your
friends like why would they want to see
me so if you guys do want to see that
video leave it in the comments below so
then I can show him that for blush I'm
going to use this Sigma Accord of Rosa
or a powder and my morphe for I've been
like obsessed with this powder lately I
think it is so pretty and so pigmented
so I'm going to do a couple things off
camera just in the interest of saving
time and I'm sure the actual story parts
are already really long but these like
three things take me the longest to do
so I'm going to line my eyes using the
Sigma wicket liner
absolute love this I'm also going to
fill in my brows using the benefit goof
proof pencil which I love and then for
lashes I'm going to use the huda beauty
lashes in Samantha so I'm going to apply
those gonna do all those off-camera and
then I will come back in to finish up
and then one will be done okay so got
the brows done the liner done and the
lashes done I'm gonna line my waterline
with the it cosmetics gel liner I
absolutely love this liner and I'm gonna
take my morphe e36 brush cuz I'm gonna
pick up the grey shade that we used and
then I'm gonna go in with the brown
shade I must use those bills on the
lower lash line
whoops even though I've been wearing
this so much unlike well I put cap on D
on the eyes why not put cap on D on the
lips so I'm gonna come in with bow and
arrow I'm not gonna do any lip liner
today but I'm just gonna do some bow and
arrow on the lips absolutely love this
color
I think I've been doing a highlight
today because I kind of like the matte
look that we have going on like the
foundations kind of our math the eyes
are all matte lips are going to be matte
but I will spray my face one more time
with the Mario Badescu spray then that
is gonna finish off my look thank you
