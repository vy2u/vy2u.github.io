today's video it's going to be a new get
ready with me I was not planning on
filming the style of video today but I
actually received this guy in the mail
this is the urban decay of a Katoch
palette the new palette I've been so
excited for this guy and I actually got
it in PR from Urban Decay which I was so
shocked about and I am just itching like
I'm just itching to get into this so I
decided to do a little get ready and
having the focus for eyes and face that
be with the Urban Decay backtalk palette
I do have a newer foundation to me that
I'm trying out as well some new liners
and a new lip product also just this and
then also the lip product is first
impression and the other items I'm using
our items that I have been testing out
for a while so you kind of give my
thoughts as I am applying them up with
us what we're going to be doing today
I'm portion of this video is going it to
be sponsored by color science they
recently sent me this product that I was
a little unsure about on first until I
started trying it and then I was like
yes yes please I will talk about this
because the results from this thing is
kind of crazy this is called their total
I 3 and one renewal therapy I'm going to
demo it so you can see the difference so
I'm completely makeup free so you can
see the difference on this guy and I'm
also gonna show you some before and
after photos as well but that's actually
what we're gonna start off with a so
pick thank you to color science for
sponsoring a portion of this video so
before we get into makeup I want to show
you guys what this does so why don't we
go ahead and get started so I have you
guys zoomed in because the focus is
going to be on the ice here so I said
color science is sponsoring the support
of the video but it's what I've been
doing before I start to apply my makeup
each day for almost two weeks now that
I've been trying out this product and
I've been pretty pretty excited about
the results from this and so I am now
making this video so again this is
called the total eye three and one
renewal therapy and what this is is a
corrector for the eyes so I have it the
little box here as well it says it's
corrects dark circles it brightens nd
puffs and it smooths of fine lines and
wrinkles so when you open it up this is
what it looks like and then this
applicator here is very coolly even
without you know putting in the fridge
or anything like that it's cooling right
away so
when you put it onto your face you're
immediately getting the kind of the
cooling factor which will then help to
deep puff the eyes I have other idols
and eye creams that like those what this
kind of applicator and I really enjoy it
especially for the morning time because
in the mornings a lot of times my eyes
can be pretty puffy I did not sleep the
bus so I've mentioned that in several
videos okay so when I keep reading it
says was a powerful clinical ingredients
total I three and one renewal therapy
provides a rustic youthful appearance
but visibly improving signs of skin
aging as the appearance of dark circles
puffiness fine lines and wrinkles are
minimized while potent hydration helps
restore the health of the delicate
under-eye area there is also SPF 35 in
this which i think is great and then it
does have a peachy tone to it which for
me is great that's kind of what I enjoy
when it comes to any sort of like color
correcting around my eyes because it
helps with the discoloration and kind of
the dark circles that I can get around
my eyes my picture that I took with this
guy this was the very first day of that
I tried it and you can see that on one
eye I do not have it applied and on the
other eye I have it applied and it was
one of those things where like I always
know that my eye area can not look the
best upon waking up in the morning until
I put some full coverage concealer on it
but taking that photo and seeing the
difference between my two eyes I was
like hmm I don't know if I actually
realize how how bad it was that
continually been using this and I just
woke up couple hours ago and this is
what my eyes look like it would be the
same as when I took that picture and I
feel like I can tell that my eye area is
improving from how I used to wake up
looking to how I'm now waking up looking
after using it for two weeks every
single day so I'm going to keep using
this every single day and see how my
results just continue to improve because
I'm pretty happy with this I'm much more
confident like this then I have been
when I took that first photo so I was
pretty excited over this so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you how I would apply it
so what you do for the applicator is
that you actually push it up here and
then the product comes out like that and
then I just kind of dot it around my eye
area and then I use the applicator
first to kind of blend it in so you can
see well hopefully you can see on camera
that it has that kind of peachy color to
it so first I like to do it with the
applicators like I said it is a
cooling-- applicator so it will help to
do puff so I start to do it that way and
then it is also recommended to just take
your finger and start to blend it in so
that is what I'm going to do and you can
put it all over your eye area underneath
your eye and then also on your eyelid as
well it is safe for that way so I have
this eye with the product on it and
completely blended out this eye has
nothing on it yet I mean you can see the
difference this makes me so excited and
I don't know if this seems like a random
thing but it just does make me really
excited because I just see the
differences so well and it just makes me
feel so much more confident this is one
of the first things that I do in the
morning and then I usually run my
errands in the morning and it's just you
know sometimes I spend that thing or I
run out I just I just add a little bit
of concealer just to kind of like make
myself feel better I don't scare the guy
at the post office you know that sort of
thing but this has been really cool
because instead of starting to feel like
I have to jump into my makeup routine I
already start to put my concealer on
this is now just a part of my skincare
step that I do in the morning and I just
think it's fantastic so I'm going to go
ahead and do the other eye as well so
this guy is $69 it says that you can get
sixty day use out of it if you use it
morning and evening so that's twice a
day I typically use mine in the morning
because I instead also give me a code
for a free mascara their mascara in
their collection you can get a free
mascara with the purchase of the eye
renewal so I did want to mention that
I'll have the code on the screen and
then I will also have it in my
description box and of course I will
have a link to it as well I will say
when they reach out to me to chat about
this I was like you know what I'll give
it a try and I'll see how it goes if it
is something that I get really excited
about that's what I like to be able to
share my findings with people and I
couldn't believe how excited I was
especially just looking at that before
and after photo the first time that I
tried it I've been very impressed with
it it's just been such a boost in my
like morning skin
routine view are someone who does
struggle with a discoloration around
your eyes dark circles fine lines things
like that then this would be a good
product for you if obviously if you do
not have those types of issues I
wouldn't say that it would be something
that is necessary for you right now but
if you've been looking for something to
not only correct right now but to also
have a longer-term effect like I said
I'm going to keep continuing to use this
and I want to compare my before after
photo from starting at two weeks ago to
like in four weeks and then even six
weeks I want to compare all of those
photos and see what my under-eye looks
like but from using it every morning
I've definitely been able to tell a
difference it said I typically apply
this as a part of my skincare routine so
it's usually a couple hours that I let
go by before I'm actually doing my
makeup so I would let a few hours go by
and then I would come in with a eye
primer like I normally would though that
is what I'm going in to do for today's
video and we're going to jump into the
back top palate which I'm quite excited
about okay so I did put my eye primer
down so no but I can O jump into the
back tuck palette I'm so excited about
this
so this palette is pretty cool if you
haven't seen it yet so it has eyes
shadows on one end all of my tones
especially right now and then you have
face shades on the other end and then it
also does come with a double-sided
mirror which you can magnetically put in
there I thought that was pretty awesome
the palette is a forty six dollars and
is available now it is exclusive to
Sephora so I will have it link down
below of course and I was I was so
surprised to get this from Urban Decay
I'm just gonna go ahead and get started
otherwise I'm gonna sit here and talk
forever but I'm first gonna take three
sheets this first one right here and I'm
going to put that all over the eye to
kind of set the primer it looks be like
a really pale pink I was not expecting
to get this from Urban Decay I do get
some PR from Urban Decay but I I don't
expect anything from any brand like no
matter if I seem to get all of their PR
or I get some I just am NOT in that
mindset where I expect anything and but
I was so excited about this palette if
you watch the will I buy it where I
featured it I was dancing over it like I
was just so excited for this one now I'm
gonna take the shade
backtalk because of course that's what I
had to use and a blending brush I'll
have everything linked down below as
always but I was so excited for it and
then it's so crazy because the day
before I'm filming this I was filming my
will I buy a video and in my will i buy
it video i was talking about a couple of
foundations now it's mentioning how i
was looking at them on sephora and i was
saying i really need to place my sephora
order i've been meaning to do it i was
like the back table pellet has been out
and I haven't even freaking ordered it
yet like I've just been so busy and I
kind of explained in there like what's
going on it has a lot to do with the
author side of my life I have a lot
going on there we're also going on a
vacation next week to Arizona for five
days and so I've been kind of stressing
getting over all my getting all my work
done before we leave for that so I can
actually just like enjoy vacation this
color is beautiful and loving it it's
building in the crease of very well and
then I was trying to decide if I wanted
to order this cover FX foundation that I
was mentioning in my will I buy up video
or what to do but yesterday after I got
done filming the will a bight video I
went back to Sephora I added my samples
I added my point perk that I wanted I
added my birthday gift because my
birthday is coming up I had my birthday
gift in there which I don't really love
all the choices is 0 it was a little bit
sad about that but I picked down my
birthday gift and I was like ok I'm
gonna place this order tonight I still
need to check Ebates I needed to
resurrect my gift card that I still have
for Sephora that I always you know I put
my gift cards in a safe place can't find
them I do this all the time so I was
like I need to make sure I can find my
gift card and then it was like I mean it
was like five hours later because I got
started I'm a judge and a writing
contest coming up and my days are truly
just spent reading all of these entries
I have over 50 entries I have to read
them I have to critique them in several
different categories that to rate them
it's a lot of work so I got I got
invested in that and then editing a
YouTube video and just once again put
off my Sephora order but it was like
five hours after I got done with the
will I buy up video the UPS man came and
this palette showed up I was like no way
like no I just didn't think over nikkei
was sending this out in PR I hadn't seen
any
nobody else get in PR and it had already
come out it was already release so I was
like oh they're just not putting it on
PR probably cuz people are so excited
about it
you know I felt like I was pretty
excited about it but even in my will I
bite video it seemed like a lot of
people were saying they wanted it it
sounds like well they're just not
centered in PR I was like I don't care
is $46 I didn't think that was bad for
face and eye shades I was like the don't
even care it goes for a gift card it's
fine we're gonna play with this shade
that's called shade it looks really
beautiful okay I did swatch the palette
both face and eye shades on my Instagram
so I'll insert the photo over here if
you want to check it out and I'm first
gonna apply that one without getting my
brush dance typically with all shimmers
I will use a damp brush but I like to
always try first just so I can get an
accurate representation because I know
not everybody will always use a damp
brush but here is what shade is looking
like I think that's pretty I think it's
pretty but I want some I want some
Martin so I'm gonna go ahead and spray
this I'm just applying that all over the
lid and I like the way that that looks
just gave it more of an info but I was I
was so surprised and I was so excited
about it and oh man I just knew I got it
yesterday it was like 5 or 6 o'clock at
night our UPS doesn't come till pretty
late so I mean obviously it was like
well past filming time for me but I was
like oh my gosh I was not expecting to
make this video today but I was like I
can't wait I can't wait I want to play
with this palette it's so bad so I did
go ahead and swatch it the swatches
looked pretty good to me I know people
were saying like the Sephora reviews
have been kind of mixed and some people
are saying there wasn't a lot of pigment
i swatched him and they seemed pretty
decent to me there was one face shade
one of the blush shades that I thought
was pretty sheer but sometimes that is
what it is with blushes which is okay
because you know you don't want to like
look too clownish but that's the shade
that I want to try today on my face just
to get an idea but I mean I've only used
two shades so far this is a first
impression this is not a review of this
palette or anything like that but I
wanted to try it out and I figured I
would try it out on the camera so you
guys could see it as well in case you
are still wondering about getting it but
all my eyelids aren't always
super exciting especially when I'm
trying out a palette I like to go for
like my kind of looks I'm just kind of
blending everything together but I like
to go for you know a technique that I
know a technique that I'm used to sort
of thing so that's just kind of what I'm
doing here so I've only used two shades
so far and I will say if there's only
well there's this one is a matte but
that's you know it's so light I can
really only use it to probably like put
over my primer or maybe to add in the
inner corner of brow bone backtalk is
that first pink shade that I use that
looked really nice and then WTF is a
really nice warm brown but those are the
only mattes in there so it kind of makes
it a little bit like challenging for me
I'm actually gonna pick up just a little
bit of back tuck actually and blend that
into the crease but I am gonna use some
shimmers on my my lower lashline and
then also on my inner corner but
definitely you know I just want to let
you guys know that of course this is
first impression I'm very curious about
the face shades as well but that's what
I'm going to do with the eyes right now
and I'll come back and add in a few more
shadows in a bit since I am doing
something a little more simple with the
shadows I am going to do a winged liner
I've been trying out this new liner from
Sigma for the past week now and I'm so
excited about it
Sigma wicked gel liner was one of my
favorites for such a long time but I've
really kind of stepped away from gel
liner so I don't use it as much well
they finally came out with two new
liners one is a liquid pen and then this
is a pencil and I am so excited about
that news and these are really really
good so I'm gonna create my wing with
the liquid pen liner that's what I
prefer for my wings you can see it has a
nice a sharp edge here is very black
it's very black it's matte has one swipe
I think I was coughing while I did that
so let me shoot that again you can
actually see it
hello but it's super super black and it
stays so so well I get so excited when I
find a good eyeliner because I only
really have one liquid liner that I've
gone on and raped
purchase so when I started trying this
one and I really liked it I was like yes
like I said I've been using this one for
about a week and I would recommend it
it's $14 from Sigma the pencil is also
really good it's really nice for the
waterline I'll be using this one as well
it stays really well in the waterline
also I mean look at that like that's
crazy it's a very creamy shows up in the
waterline it's super well this one is
$11
I am a Sigma affiliate I did get these
sent for me from Sigma if you purchase
with my code would just Samantha Sigma I
do make a commission so I wanted to let
you know that but I've been super
excited over these so it's easier for me
to do my winged liner off-camera last
time I did it get ready with me I did it
on camera
it was child drink so I'm gonna go ahead
and pop off camera and do my liner have
my liner on and then I also decided to
add some lashes I really wasn't sure
what I was doing with this look like I
said I just kind of was like I just want
to film this for you though so I didn't
have a whole lot planned but I did put
on some lashes they're from morphe I'll
have them linked in my description box
as always but I'm going to pause on the
eyes for a second I'm going to work on
my face so I wanted to try this Revlon
Photoready instant filter foundation
I've tried it one time so far and I
really wasn't and I wasn't really sure
what I thought so I want to give it
another try
I have the shade natural beige I did get
APR package from Brooklyn and it came
with a bunch of these foundations and I
was curious to try it out because these
are like $18 for a drugstore foundation
and I was like I want to see if that is
really worth it the like applicator is
very crazy I know that you do have to
shake it and then twist it up and the
first time I was using it I kept
twisting in it was like I was getting
such a little product out but once you
shake it then you can get it to come out
so when I used it for the first time I
remember using my Smashbox the primer
Iser primer and I was like oh I'm giving
this foundation an unfair advantage
because that primer is awesome and it
looks like any foundation that I used
that primer I feel like it looks
fantastic so I was like should I use
that primer but I was going out so I was
like well I still want my skin to look
nice but even then I didn't love how the
foundation looked so I was kind of
surprised but I want to try it with this
one this has been kind of my go-to
primer this week this is the flower in
new prime a pore minimizing primer you
can tell that I obviously
and it's not very impressed with me
lately not impressed with my sleeping
schedule or my eating schedule just it
just happens I mean what I'm so busy
like how I am right now and stressed
about a lot of different things this is
what happens and not drinking enough
water I don't even know if I had a glass
of water yesterday and I was really
disappointed with myself so I'm gonna go
ahead and use this primer you twist it
up there's what it looks like so I just
kind of like dotted it on my face I'm
not sure this is the best shape match
for me either
and then I kind of blended it out with
the applicator but I'm not sure like I
really love that so I have a Sigma brush
here next to me as well I don't know it
just kind of feels strange so I felt
like when I used it the first time that
it just didn't really do much for my
skin and it looked pretty dry which
surprised me like I do have dry skin
right now but especially using that
primer Iser it usually makes my skin
look pretty nice and hydrated so I was
surprised that my skin looked so dry it
kind of just makes my skin look kind of
like flat and a little dull I don't know
have you guys tried this one from Revlon
like I still I'm just not I'm just not
feeling it and those are two of my
favorite primers you guys can let me
know what do you think do you like it do
that um but yeah still not my favorite
I'll try it a few more times it's still
not my favorite okay because I am having
some skin issues that's when I come in
what the Urban Decay all nighter
concealer this is a full-coverage and
it's pretty Bob not only do I enjoy it
for under my eyes but for like covering
up blemishes it's just like no joke man
like it really is just no joke so it is
a more of a drier formula so I work one
eye then the other eye and then I hide
anything that needs to be hidden are all
concealed up with the all nighter
concealer I'm going to do contour
bronzer and then also my brows off
camera because I don't have anything
like new for them and then we're gonna
jump back into the backtalk palette to
finish off the eyes and also try out the
blush and the highlight shades brows and
bronzer are on and I can see like my dry
patches over here I don't know if that
Revlon foundation is good for people
with dry skin finish off
eyes so I am going to use the Sigma
eyeliner pencil and just pop that into
my waterline so it's a really pigmented
really creamy and it doesn't take me
anything to glide it along the waterline
which i think is fantastic I'm so
excited about these I get like I'm that
person that gets excited about eyeliner
okay I made a whole video on overlooked
makeup products and included eyeliner in
there because I'm a big fan big fan of
eyeliner so now we get to go back into
the back tuck palette I want to try this
WTF the matte Brown I want to see what
that was about
so I'm going to smudge that along the
lower lash line put it pretty close to
the lash line it did seem pretty
pigmented when i swatched it and i'm
showing up really well maybe I'll put
some of this one right here which is
called attitude I haven't said altitude
whoa I'm gonna smudge that one on the
lower lash line as well and then I'm
gonna pick up some of curve which is the
third shade and I'm going to put that
into the inner corner
let me used a few shades I'm telling you
my eyeshadow technique is typically
pretty simple so that's gonna do it for
the eye look again pretty simple but I'm
pretty happy with all of the shades that
I use I thought they were coming across
pigmented blendable I didn't have any
issues with them so I'm excited to keep
trying it out the only thing that I kind
of worried about what this one is will I
get like enough diverse looks with it
like some of these like I wish there was
one more colorful matte I really like
backtalk and I do like WTF I'm glad it's
in there but I wish there was one more
like a purple or pink type of matte
shade and then like these two are both
pretty light and I wish maybe one of
them was you know something a little bit
more different colorful shimmer wise so
I'll need to definitely play around with
it and just see what are all the
different types of looks that I can come
up with with this palette but so far
first impression wise I'm pretty happy
with it I don't I don't have any
complains at the moment for the
eyeshadow part so I'm gonna go
head and flip it and then I'm going in
to play with these face shades which I'm
super excited about so double-take was
the one that I was talking about in my
swatches that I felt like swatch pretty
sheer so that's the one that I wanted to
use as my blush shade again it's not
necessarily terrible to me if a blush
swatches more sheer because I would
rather be able to build my blush up then
come across as the clown right away but
we're gonna try that one I feel like
that's showing up really well but I hit
it twice in the blush and then tapped
off the excess but I feel like that
showed up pretty darn well for the
highlight I'm gonna try it this one
right here which is party foul see how
this highlight is oh that's pretty
mm-hmm a big fan of Urban Decay
highlights but they're also kind of hit
or miss for me that's really pretty but
so far so good for this one mm-hmm
I feel like it's showing a lot of
texture over here on this side which I
don't always get a ton of and it
honestly makes me wonder if maybe the
Revlon foundation is playing into this I
feel like those face shades showed up
really well for me I'm I have no
complaints about those really wanted to
play with it today and just bust into it
and see kind of like my first thoughts
so that's you know my first impression
and demo with the backtalk palette stay
tuned I'll definitely be reviewing it oh
pretty excited about this mmm go ahead
and spray my face with the Urban Decay
chill spray just because I feel like
that foundation is like drying on me I
want some hydration but into my skin and
to finish off the look I have this a new
guy here this is from Revlon it's the
kiss plumping lip creme I just got this
in the PR package as well the shades I
picked out is in Kashmir creme and this
is what it looks like these are $9.99 on
the Ulta website says it's supposed to
plump lips especially over time it has
like a cooling sensation to it so I
thought I would go ahead and give this a
try so you just squeeze it up like so
mmm I'm not really enjoying this I'm not
really enjoying this at the moment what
is this um I don't feel like that looks
good in the slightest oh no I think the
slip creme is like a really big fail
actually oh no like it applied really
like galapiat it's coming into my bind
and it's very sheer and it's not cute at
all
like when you move it it basically like
disappears mm-hmm I can feel the the
tingling sensation it's not like too
overwhelming but like thoughts not cute
that's not cute at all I would not wear
this I'm gonna wipe this off know what
try an urban decay lipstick instead this
is a newer one to me this is stark naked
and it's one of the comfort matte
finishes I'm gonna try this one instead
because that was not flattering much
much better thank you over in the K I
got because I've been sitting here for
almost three hours filming this so I
took my jacket off but this is the final
look and I'm pretty like for the most
part I'm overall pretty excited about it
besides that lipstick being so horrible
there's any which fat bells about blood
I have a couple other shades I'll pull
up out and trying just to make sure
maybe it's like not that one but man
that was really really bizarre and again
the Revlon foundation isn't my absolute
favorite but I feel like I made it work
and it really helps especially when I
feel like a foundation is too drying it
really helps to just spread the crap out
of my face so the Urban Decay spray
really helped but I like the way that
the eye look it came out I know it's so
simple but for me I'm just a simple girl
I'm just a simple gal but I really like
the way that the eyelid came out I think
looks so pretty and I love like that
highlight with that you lookin you
looking I think it looks really really
nice and so again that was my first
impression with the backtalk palette
taken with a grain of salt let me keep
trying it let me actually preview this
guy because I'm definitely going to be
very excited with everything that I've
tried out both swatches and now putting
it on my face I'm really happy about it
so
that is the final look a for it might
get ready with me I feel you it was so
long ago that I talked about these
colors science but that product will
also be linked up below as well as the
code if you want to try it out for
yourself and get a free mascara
hopefully the photos helped and the demo
helped so you can see why I was actually
really excited to talk about that
product and how much it has been helping
me lately so again a big thing you to
