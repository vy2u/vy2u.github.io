today's video is going to be a little
casual get ready with me
this is stemming from a video I did
about two weeks ago of the live had PR
Hall and I asked two people what they
would want to see most with some of the
products that I was hauling and it
seemed the most requested was a get
ready with me using the product seeing
how they apply but then actually
reviewing them so I've taken about two
weeks I've been using these products
like crazy so we cannot have this get
ready with me I'll show you how
everything is applying but I will
actually be reviewing the majority of
the products I think I only have like
maybe two products in here that are
going to be a first impression but I
thought I could try them out in this
video as well so I have like Charlotte
Tilbury Urban Decay Kevin Kwan pure
cosmetics and more so if you want to do
a get ready with me and I get some new
makeup reviews let me go ahead and get
started I'm going to start off with the
eyes a like I normally do and I hauled
both the Charlotte Tilbury instant eye
palette in that video and then also the
urban decay distortion of palette but I
felt like more people were curious about
the instant eye palette from Charlotte
Tilbury so that's what I'm going to go
ahead and use in my eyes today but I
will touch briefly on the urban decay
distortion here in a bit but I'm going
to be using the instant eye palette from
Charlotte Tilbury now this was the first
time that I was trying out an eye shadow
palette from Charlotte Tilbury so this
palette is $75 you can also find it on
beauty lush so I'll have some links down
below and it's separated into little
trios here that day I a dust guy a date
I and then a disco eye and I have used
almost every single shade in this
palette I have been trying it out trying
to get a good feel for it especially
with that having a $75 price tag I know
a lot of people are saying is that worth
it so let's go start with this eyelid
I'm going to come into the first shade
right here which is just kind of a matte
white shade I'm gonna use the mode a
super crease brush I do have some eye
shadow primer on and then I'm just gonna
go ahead and set that primer with the
first shade and then I'm going to come
into a desk eye and use this middle
Brown right here I'm going to use the
morphe 27 I'm just going to sweep that
one into the crease as my first
transition color and then I'm going to
come in to date eye and use the last a
matte Brown here and I you
my Sigma e25 for this and I'm going to
concentrate this color on the outer part
of the lid and then slowly work on
blending that in but not taking it all
the way to the inner part of my eye and
then slowly just kind of flicking that
shade outwards as well but this palette
I will say that the mats are really
really good I mean if you saw with that
second Brown that I put on the outer
part I mean it is boom it is there it is
pigmented they are really easy to blend
the math are really really good - the
black here i swatched it when I did the
live haul it's not very black it's not
it doesn't really pack much of any sort
of punch but other than that the other
mattes in here are very very nice
the shimmers to me are lacking and we
are going to put a shimmer color on and
I think it's the only shimmer that I
have not used on my eye yet is one from
day I so that's what I'm gonna try out
today I think every other shimmer I have
tried I really do like this one from
disco eye I have a tutorial on my
Instagram using that one I will leave it
linked down below and I know I was
wearing it in one of my videos I think
it was my flashback Friday for myself
for my Cyber Monday haul last year I
believe that's the one that has that I
look in there it's really really nice
but it takes a very long time and to
build up you definitely have to have a
damp brush when working with these
shimmers and you just have to take your
time this shimmer right here and day I
was actually pretty disappointing it's
very very sheer and it's mostly just
very glittery so that one didn't really
do much at all the other three shimmers
that I've used were just like okay they
need help you need to take your time
definitely the mass in here are way
better than the shimmers but they're
like decent they're decent I just
sprayed my Sigma this is a concealer F a
70 brush then I'm gonna come into the
second shade from the desk I side and
see how this one goes see can you guys
tell like it does even with a damp brush
like I don't even really want to know
what it would be like without using the
damp brush so I mean you can get it
there you just have to build
you have to take your time with it I
just have to take more time that I want
to building them up you can see already
like it's starting to come along it's
starting to come along it wants to be
there so I'm just gonna take my time and
work on building up the shimmer once I
do have that pretty build up I'm going
to come back in with the e25 I'm just
going to make sure everything is really
blended together so that's really all
I'm going it to do for the eyes it's
really nothing like super challenging or
crazy but really with the palette like
this you have different variations of
browns and different variations of very
light shimmers so you're pretty limited
with what you can do with the palette
but if that is your vibe and you like
you know something like super you know
kind of simple like a simple layout like
this I think that you would probably
like the palette but if you're more
adventurous or if you're someone who
really loves a really good shimmer that
packs a punch I don't think that you
would have much use for this palette so
overall before we keep on rollin and
such what do I think of this palette do
I think it's worth the $75 what I
recommend it and all of that I will say
that the packaging kind of surprised me
because it's just the plastic packaging
and I don't know why I thought it would
be something maybe a little bit more
heavy duty you do get a nice mirror thit
which is good I like the layout of it I
like palettes that have kind of like a
certain layout to it because I'm not a
makeup artist I'm not artistically
creative like sometimes I need a palette
like this to kind of help me out so I do
appreciate that but like I said there's
really not a lot of variations with this
palette there's not really a whole lot
that you can do the shimmers in here I
mean they're not like the same but
they're very very similar to one another
so it's just it's gonna be kind of hard
to get a lot of different looks out of a
palette like this even though you have
you know a variety of different shades
in here they're just also super similar
that you might not be able to get a lot
of use out of them and then like I said
the mats are really really nice in here
I think the mats are really great
pigmented easy to blend those are
wonderful but the shimmers that do take
quite a bit of time and I feel like they
can fade pretty easily which I don't
think is great so overall I can't say
that I think that this is worth the $75
I know that you can find out
you delish and you know maybe if you can
find some sort of deal or discount on it
it's still a nice palette it's not bad
you know it's not like the worst palette
I've ever tried or anything like that
it's still a nice eye shadow palette but
I think for what you're getting inside
and then especially with having to work
so hard for the shimmers I can't say
that it's yes spend $75 on it I just
don't think it would be in that price
range for me personally a nice palette
the quality overall didn't blow me away
like formula wise didn't completely blow
me away if this would have been an all
matte palette I think I would have been
much more excited but it just was kind
of a bummer to see those shimmers and
not work out quite as well as the mattes
did but I think it's just okay and for
$75 I need something a little bit better
than okay so next up I do want to just
put the eyes on whole very do something
really simple with the eyes I'm just
going to do mascara I'm not gonna do
lashes or crazy liner today so I am
gonna move over to the face before I
finish off the eyes this is an item that
will be a first impression I haven't
tried this one out yet but it is from
Charlotte Tilbury as well
this is the magic foundation now I have
tried the light Wonder Foundation and I
absolutely love it so I'm curious to see
how the magic a foundation works out I
got mine in the shade medium this was
sent to me from my Charlotte Tilbury as
well I have some new brushes here also
all these in the live chat these are
from Real Techniques I'll be honest I
have meant to use these as so many times
as since getting them in the live haul
and I've just completely forgot but this
one I'm actually not gonna use this for
face I think I see my friend Liv she
really liked it for her face but I think
this is just gonna be too big for me I'm
gonna hold off on that one but I have
these two little brushes that I want to
try out this one it says it is for
foundation and I feel like it would be a
better fit for my face this one is
$19.99 and then this one is - this is
the contour brush for $19.99 they sent
me a couple other brushes too but I set
those aside for a give away these
honestly like the reason why I haven't
gravitated towards on this because these
aren't like my favorite brushes ever to
use I have a couple other brushes like
this in the similar style and I just
don't reach for them a ton I reach for
my regular brushes or my beauty blenders
over them but we're going to give them a
try so I know I need to test the
they do have my face already primed so
we are going to try this out so this is
not a pump this is what the foundation
looks like okay is that right or no that
can't be right can it there okay I was
like this does not seem right but it was
like it was loose I haven't opened it at
all it was like this part was loose I
was like wait a sec if I could not did
you guys see my face I can't wait to
play that back like what okay so we'll
just go ahead and see here I was looking
at the Beauty Alysha website earlier and
it says that this foundation is $44
these brushes are super super soft oh I
like that it looks to be right now
pretty medium coverage my skin is kind
of mad at me so I have some redness on
my chin and it's covering most of it but
not quite all of it so I'm gonna do just
maybe like one and a half more pumps of
foundation to try to cover up some more
of that redness like with that first
pass it almost looks like a light to
medium coverage and it's kind of crazy
because looking at it it says on the
Beauty lush website that this is full
coverage so let's see if we can build it
up I mean I don't need full coverage I
don't really love full coverage but
maybe you have to build it up I'm used
to like with a full coverage foundation
like the Urban Decay all nighter
foundation I wore that the other day I
mean that you need like so little
foundation and it like boom yeah so I
can skin on I know what do you see in
your skin let that foundation I mean now
I would say it's just like straight
medium coverage and I can still see
redness on my chin so I don't know I
don't think there's a full coverage
foundation unless you want to do like
seven pumps of it or something um it
looks nice though so far I still think
that I like the light wonder from
Charlotte Tilbury a lot more that one
was one that I immediately put it on it
was like oh my skin look it's beautiful
gosh I thought was really nice
this is a good size for my face so I
liked it it was really easy to blend out
and really really soft
again I don't gravitate towards these
brushes a ton but this one was actually
pretty nice it was nice and and easy to
move around the handle was easy to grip
too kind of moves with your hand instead
of just being like like I felt like that
was pretty nice so so far so good on the
brushes you know pretty pretty good
pretty good for the foundation so next
up I have an item that I know a lot of
people are very very curious about and
this is one that that I have been
producing almost every single day trying
to get a review for that is the Urban
Decay all nighter concealer I got asked
a ton of times over in that live chat if
I would do a review for the all-nighter
so I am using the shade a light neutral
and this is what the applicator looks
like pretty standard applicator here so
I'm just going to go ahead and apply it
under one eye here and you really do not
need a little hot with this concealer
I'm telling you
and then I'm gonna pick up the other
Real Techniques brush and use that to
blend it out and see how we do I
honestly think that this concealer is
butter with a damp Beauty Blender but
honestly actually this was working out
really well okay normally I don't do
brushes like this a lot for under the
eye area because I think that it kind of
pulls and tugs a little bit too much but
this is my pennis for nuts using the
sooners so I can review them so we have
to do a first impressions in here so
this is my punishment this is what I
deserve for not using these brushes but
actually it's bringing out much better
than I thought it was going to that's
kind of freaking me out
okay okay Real Techniques but here's the
one side with concealer and then the
other side without concealer so what do
I think about this concealer this
concealer is full coverage they are not
lying when they say that this is a very
very full coverage concealer they're not
lying when they say you need a little
bit I mean even with the shape tape I
tend to go crazy and like draw it all
over my eyes and you know all over my
face and then it just gets away from
myself you truly truly truly do not need
that with this it has pros and I think
of how
Conn's I will tell you both of my
opinions and then you you know you just
have to make your decision from there
depending on what you prefer in a
concealer what your skin type is and all
of that how well this is even going
underneath my eye well this this brush
this brush is really exciting me and I
do not get excited about these type of
brushes so hey that's amazing
so this concealer like I said is a very
very full coverage if you need help
hiding dark circles on your under eyes
if you need help hiding blemishes she
gon do it for you very very full
coverage the first thing I noticed when
I applied it and I only use it that day
as I was doing the live chat but I was
like one of the first things that I
notice is that it's drying I don't
typically love a drier formula when it
comes to concealer because I can deal
with dry under eyes so if I'm putting on
a dry concealer I'm kind of having to
like tug and pull at my under eyes it's
just kind of a hot mess so that to me is
a con but like I said if you use a damp
Beauty Blender it blends out much easily
or just get this Real Techniques brush
now because hello I like this way more
because I've been trying with you know
beauty blenders and different types of
my favorite concealer brushes and this
one is taking the cake right now I hate
doing that with first impressions like
this I know favorite but honestly I'm
trying so many different brushes with
this concealer and I'm like no it's the
Beauty Blender I mean I still would pick
the Beauty Blender but this is a very
close second but I like the Beauty
Blender because it kind of helps bring a
little bit of moisture back into it so
it's not quite as dry that to me it was
a downfall and to me you have to do one
eye and then the other eye I can't do
something where I do both under eyes or
the middle of my face I have to take it
one at a time that's normally not my
favorite way to do a concealer but there
is also a lot of pros with this one in
that it does seem to blend out easy when
I use the Beauty Blender and this brush
it does blend out very easily sometimes
with drier concealers I kind of have to
really work and pull and tug to get it
to blend out this is very easy to blend
out and very quickly to blend out also
it makes the under eye area look so
freaking good
Emer eyes just look pretty darn flawless
and just nice I don't know how else to
explain it but
really does make the honor eyes look
very very nice and then I will also say
is that I didn't experience a lot of
creasing with this one either and that
was another thing in the live chat I had
had it on for like seven or eight hours
or something by the time I did the live
chat a couple weeks ago and I was
looking at the mirror right up in my
face and I was like I really don't
notice much of anything going on here
when it came to like creasing or you
know like settling into wrinkles or
things like that so I think that is very
good as well I've been trying to compare
because like I said there's pros and
there's cons and it just kind of depends
on your preference but I don't always
need like a super full coverage on my
under eyes and sometimes it's just a
little bit too much for me but if you're
someone who really loves sole coverage I
think that you would really like this
one I would just be aware that it's a
little bit drier honestly if that wasn't
happening with this concealer I would
probably say like yes five stars
absolutely love it but because it has
just that one little con that to me is a
big deal that might not be a big deal to
you to me it's a bigger deal and not
what I preferred my concealer so that's
why I give it like four stars I still
really like it and I've still been using
it a ton and not just because I need to
review but because I actually do like it
or especially for days if I don't sleep
well and I have the dark under eyes I
know I can come into this one and it's
going to cover everything it's going to
kind of like lift my under eyes and just
make everything look better under there
I also really really enjoy this for
covering imperfections so I'm going to
use this on my chin I think this is
really really nice to cover blemishes I
don't really do a lot of color
correcting I know that that's kind of
like a big thing I really just don't do
it a ton I typically will just use my
concealer and I mean you can see like it
is very very full coverage but it is
going to cover up those blemishes that
the foundation could not do so now I
feel a ton better because that's what it
covered that right up so this I think as
freaking bomb for covering blemishes I'm
not saying that you know this can
replace your color corrector or if
you're someone who really deals with
really bad or like cystic acne or things
like that I'm not saying go put the
concealer all over your face you
probably still need to do some sort of
color correcting but maybe if you're
someone like me who only deals with
breakouts during certain times the
and all of that fun stuff or like
stress-related breakouts and things and
you want to cover up the redness those
are some pros and some cons of the
concealer and then you know you just
kinda have to make your choice for
therefore what you prefer but I really
do like it like I said I would give it a
4 star review it's $29 so I think it's
pretty pricey I think the shape tape is
maybe like $27 and I think you actually
get more with the shape tape you get
more product to not think this in the
shape tape I don't think they're a dupe
for one another I don't think that
they're super similar the shape tape I
don't find to be drying at all it has a
completely different applicator but I
still like this one in its own I still
like it for what it is there's just a
few cons in there that would make me not
give it a five-star review but I give it
a solid 4 star so I did go ahead and set
it real quickly with a setting powder
and next up I want to talk about this -
Kevin a Quan neo trio and this I did not
put in that live para Hall I've had it
for some time I did get it sent to me in
PR though and I have been testing them
out lately so I thought I could put it
in here since this is mostly focused on
giving reviews so again this is called
the neo trio and it is at $58 it is also
available at Sephora and inside you have
the Neill limelight in Ibiza which is a
highlight and then you also have the
Neil bronzer in Capri so this one's
really interesting you have a bronzer of
blush and then also what can be used as
a highlight and then this last one here
is the Neil setting powder so they say
that this is a setting powder and it
says on the back it has a matte side and
then the shimmer side to me it was all
shimmer I'm not gonna lie all of it with
shimmer so I've never used this as a
setting powder because it has a lot of
shimmer to it so I don't know why I
would put that on my under eyes and the
actual highlight again it kind of has
this like ombre effect you can do more
of the purple iridescent or you can
combine it all or you can just do the
middle here so these two are from that
palette but I'm going to go ahead and
use the bronzer and blush from the Capri
palette and I'll show you guys how they
apply okay so I'm going to go ahead and
use the bronzer and I like using this
Moda brush this is a mode of buffer
brush because it's a little bit smaller
because the tricky
thing about these is that obviously the
colors are like ombre together so you
can kind of like roar you know what I'm
saying
so I just kind of lightly dip in to
there and then I'm going to go ahead and
bronze up the skin with it it's actually
a really beautiful bronzer though I like
so many of Kevyn Aucoin space products
it is unreal bronzers the sculpting
powder highlights like they are just
really really nice and I like this
bronzer and the blush I've been reaching
for the blush so much too I think I've
actually been reaching for the blush
more than the bronzer to be honest but I
just think both are really really pretty
you just need to make sure you have the
smaller brushes to get into them
correctly which can direct mail but badi
but the end result is really pretty
so again you get all three palettes for
$58 and if you were to buy a one full
size of like the Niall highlighter or
you know neo bronzer the one full size
is $58 so you're getting a little bit
smaller of the trio items but then you
get to try out them instead of spending
the full price on just one and it's
definitely more of a high-end luxury
brand seriously there are so many items
from the brand that I just think are
really really stunning if you can cope
with the price tag definitely don't
think that trio is going to be for
everybody but again it would be a good
way to try out the products I also
really like the contour and sculpting
book and the making faces beauty book
again they come with a lot of different
items in there because to purchase
full-size Kevyn Aucoin single products
are pretty darn crazy but if you buy
something like this trio or the contour
book or the making faces beauty book
they're higher prices but for the value
inside and for everything that you're
getting is actually a really good deal
so I would say to check those out as
well and see kind of like what suits
your fancy and what would make sense for
you so then I'm just gonna kind of dip
into the middle of this here I'm using
my Sigma f40 and I'm just going to use
this as my blush and again I think this
blush is just so pretty
if you want to try it out and see if
it's for you you could get the bundle if
that makes sense to you but that is the
bronzer and the blush on me the
highlights are really pretty but I have
another palette
I'm gonna use for highlights again like
I said I don't use this one as a setting
powder at all but it gives a really nice
kind of more natural yet your doesn't at
the same time so that doesn't make a ton
of sense but this this one when I use it
as a highlight it's not like super
blinding or super overpowering can be
seen from space so if you like a more
subtle highlight but something that's
still really cool and kind of funky with
this kind of iridescent nested then this
is what I use as a highlight when I am
you know doing those days and if you
want something a little bit more on the
adventurous side you can go forward the
more the purple tone in here or you can
mix them together but this one
definitely give us more of like a poppin
highlight versus the one that's like the
setting powder so that's kind of my
feedback on this little neo trio palette
from that Kevin Daquan and talk about
the other eyeshadow palette then I
hauled in there this is the urban decay
distortion palette you can see the
packaging is really really funky I
believe this is a $48 so this one when I
held it I first was like hmm I don't
know I mean like looks cool but a
hundred percent on this and as we were
going throughout the live chat and you
know reading the comments someone said
if you put the black on and then you
layer it with these transformer shades
which is the first row it's supposed to
be really cool and I was like oh I get
it I had just gotten it like an hour
before I started my live chat so I
really had no information on it yet and
I was kind of like okay I get it so you
do get a really big mirror and then you
have all these different shades in here
and the top row is supposed to be these
transformer shades where you can overlay
on top of really any of the shades in
here and it will make it kind of like a
different color now these are all
shimmers in here except for the black
which is a matte black I will insert a
photo of some swatches in here as well
they are over on my Instagram but when i
swatched the black on camera I like went
insane I was like that is the blackest
black like creamy black eyeshadow
normally you do not get that with black
eyeshadows and I had just watched the
Charlotte Tilbury instant eye palette
before that and the black was really
really like kind of a letdown so then I
went and swatch this one and I was like
okay so I have been using this palette I
will have a tutorial on Instagram if
it's
not up yet it will be coming soon I did
a purple eye look the other day and I
always have such a struggle or
remembering bunch of videos they were I
think it was makeup that I won't pay
full price for I had a purple eye look
that is actually from this palette using
the black and then using mind-game from
the first row over it and it created a
really cool purple color so this palette
is very very interesting to me now you
don't have to use the transformer shades
of course I have used a territorial all
over my lid as well and it was a really
nice brown color I will say the purples
I've used it was this one which is kind
of like a purpley pink no one was not
quite as exciting as I hoped it would be
but the blue was really nice so I
haven't used every single shade out of
here but I've used it several of them on
my eyes aren't some sort of combination
on my eyes so I could chat about it I
feel like this is a really interesting
palette and I feel like it's pretty
unique with those transformer shades
because it kind of opens up you know
you're not only getting just these
eyeshadows now you can mix and match and
layer and it's kind of interesting but
my con with that is that sometimes I
don't really want to do that like
sometimes I just kind of want to create
a somewhat normal I shadow look and this
really is geared more towards you know
like the artistic more vibrant creative
which sometimes I do reach for those
types of looks and I want to create them
but I definitely have other palettes
that I can do that for so it's like do I
need a whole other palette just to
create something kind of funky and
offbeat for me personally know maybe for
you that's your vibe in your style then
I think that you would really like this
one and there's a lot of different
options that you can do like I mentioned
I'm not someone who's artistically
creative but I got excited when I
started swatching and I understood what
this palette was about and I've had fun
playing with it and using it and seeing
what type of looks I can come up with
but I still prefer the Urban Decay heavy
metal eyeshadow palette over this one
and that one is all shimmers as well but
those I just feel like there's there's
even more possibilities in there there's
different shades and tones and warm
tones and cool tones and I just have so
much fun playing with the Urban Decay
heavy metal palette which is a complete
shock to me because it's all shimmer I
didn't think I'd be able to get a lot of
looks out of it and I use it so
frequently I know that these you know
both released very
frequently and kind of right behind one
another would I recommend the heavy
metal shimmer palette or would I
recommend the distortion palette I'm
gonna go ahead and have to say the heavy
metal palette I still just like it a lot
more this isn't a bad palette and again
it's you know a lot of the shades are
pigmented there's a lot of like unique
qualities with this one but I just don't
find myself I don't think that I will
reach for this one as much as some of my
other ones including that heavy metal
palette so still cool just not all the
shades are quite as good as the others
and then with these transformer colors
unless you're using them as a
transformer color they don't do a lot on
the eyes so then you know it's kind of
like a toss-up they're like is it worth
the $48 there's no other mattes in there
besides the black which the black is
freakin amazing though I will say that
and I do like the mirror packaging is
very cool but if you know of course as
with everything it's going to come down
to your personal preference hopefully
some of those pros and cons help you out
for me it's still a good palette but
just not one that I think that I would
reach for enough to like really get
super hyped and crazy over it but it's
still a nice palette I filled in my
brows off-camera and I'm gonna come back
into the Charlotte Tilbury palette now
and then finish off the eyes so I'm just
gonna take a mixture of these two
Browns from the desk eye aside I'm going
to use this is an elf what is this an
elf
2:02 brush it's just like a pencil brush
it looks exactly like the Sigma e30 that
I love so much and I'm just going to
smudge both of those shades onto the
lower lash line and then I'm going to
use the same matte white that I used the
very first shade that I used and my
morphe 36 and I'm just going to place
that on to the inner part of my eye just
to brighten it up and then also on to
the brow bone because I'm not gonna do
lashes today so I'm just gonna do a some
up here baked look mascara I don't have
any new mascaras either so I just did my
mascara clutter so I'm trying to get
through some of the ones that I was like
I know it just has a few uses loved so
I'm gonna play this to my lashes like
I'm not a big mascara fan but this is a
good bus gara
I have some items here from pur
cosmetics that I want to talk about but
before I do that I forgot that I had an
announcement to make in this video this
video is going up on Friday which is
December 1st and on December 1st I'm
kicking off 12 Days of Giveaways across
my YouTube my Instagram and then also my
snapchat so every single day for the
next 12 days I will have an item up for
grabs so I'm really excited to be doing
this so I hope that you're subscribed
over here it's my youtube channel and
also be sure to check me out on
Instagram and then also snapchat all of
those will be listed down below and then
I'll also be doing quite a few
announcements on my Twitter as well so I
will have all that information in the
description box that I'll like I
normally do but I'm really excited to
kick off 12 Days of Giveaways and give
away a prize every single day and I
wanted to do it across a bunch of
different social media platforms because
I know not everybody has all of the
platforms so I wanted to try to make it
as inclusive as I could so I'm so
excited it's kicking off today so happy
you got a pallet inside it you have at
six different shades and then you also
do have a mirror I was so excited when I
saw this because I really enjoy pure
highlights they have a couple of
highlight shades in their family
palettes and I love them so when I saw
the highlight palette I was like cannot
wait and I really really enjoy this
palette I've been using it so much for
shade in here is really good
except for this top middle one which is
called sultry this one is just like
glitter I don't know how that one got in
there because all the other ones are
actual like really nice beautiful
highlights
except for sultry is it's kind of just
real glittery so and that the other five
are really really gorgeous there are the
first three swatched out so this first
one is really cool iridescent I've
really been liking that one and then
this one has a lot of like pinky tones
to it and then here are the three in the
bottom row there are those as watched
out this last one here is just a little
bit too dark for me but other than that
everything works even this pink one
which I wasn't so sure about but I've
used that one as well so I really like
all of them except for just that one
like I feel like you can just see like
it's not it's just like glitter but the
one that I really haven't gravitating
towards the most is this first one
Twilight so I'm going to use today I'm
going to use these things
a35 to apply that like you say that I
barely had to touch the brush to my
cheeks it's it's so beautiful or is what
Twilight looks like on my cheeks the
palette is available for $32 I would
highly recommend this one if you're on
the lookout for a new highlight palette
which I know there's a lot of highlight
pellets out there but if you've been
trying to decide or you you know you
need to know what's worth and what's not
I would definitely say this is worth the
$32 already so that is going into do it
too for face makeup and now I'm going to
do a lip product I did want to touch on
this one briefly because I've been using
it so much lately this is from Dior this
is called the lip glow color Reviver
balm and they get this one from actally
and you know what I was just I was just
simply curious about it about this
packaging is like super bougie which I
thought was fun I like to look kind of
like pink here as well this is what the
lip balm looks like it's a really nice
lip balm I've actually been carrying it
around in my purse because I like it so
much it's very like thick like I don't
feel like with one swipe you are just
getting a lot of lip balm out and it's
really kind of like luxurious on the
lips which is great because it's $33 it
better be luxurious for $33 I did not
know that that was the Prague when I
ordered it and I actually just lifted up
before I started filming this video and
I was like $30 that's a lot of money for
a lip balm but at least it's really
really nice it is I like I said I've
been thrown it in my purse just and not
even just because I've been reviewing it
except in reviewing it for a while I
just really like it and I feel like it's
just like nice and thick and like it's
really protecting my lips which is great
I don't think I would repurchase those
from myself though at $33 like I have
other lip balms that I really do enjoy
it's still really nice if you like this
is your style or like you loved your and
you like to collect a lot of things from
Dior but you were like is that lip glow
really that nice it is really nice don't
get me wrong
but now let's switch over and talk about
a $30 lipstick because why not this look
I this is a little mini guys this
wouldn't be $30 but this is
lipstick from Marc Jacobs it is the Ola
Marc lip creme and it's in the shade
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
I do have another one of these many guys
actually it came in a support of
favorite sets oh there we go
says Marc Jacobs on the side I came
alone in my Sephora favorite sets I have
it in slow burn and I absolutely love it
I actually just got like a sephora
sample bag they were having some sort of
like get a bag full of samples when you
place an order I think I'm like Black
Friday or something and so I got a
sample bag in and it came with this
lipstick and so I thought let's see what
this color looks like so here is what
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang looks like and let's
see what it looks like on the lips oh
that's fine I'm not sure why I thought
it was gonna be more red when I just
kind of glanced at it but it's
definitely more like a pop and pink I
guess that I do have slow burn I really
like this formula but like with a lot of
Marc Jacobs things I really like them
and I recommend them but it's hard for
me to pay full price for them and I
enjoyed getting these minis if I can get
them as a sample and some sort of lip
set I'm totally fine with that because
they're really good they're really
creamy and comfortable on the lips but
they're really nice and long-lasting the
color and the pigment really sticks
around for a long time so I think
they're really nice so when I saw that I
could get another little mini guy in a
shade that I don't already have because
I feel like slow burn shows up a lot as
like samples 100-point perks things like
that when I saw a different shade in
there I just had to go for it so this is
the Kiss Kiss Bang Bang from Marc Jacobs
already so this is the final look that I
came up with I hope that you guys
enjoyed this video and seeing me try out
some new makeup and then also give my
thoughts and reviews on them I hope that
you guys found that helpful versus more
than just a first impression type of
video thank you to everyone who voted

those new products of that I shared in

about all of them down below which ones
you're gravitating towards which ones

that what you thought of the reviews as
