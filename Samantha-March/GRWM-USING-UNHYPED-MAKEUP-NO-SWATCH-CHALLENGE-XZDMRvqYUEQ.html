today's video is going to be a get ready
with me so I'm going to be getting ready
on camera going to do this one using a
lot of like unhides makeup or indie
brands or just makeup products that
people aren't talking about a lot you
know I definitely do this too but a lot
of times we use the same products over
and over or the same brands or
everybody's using kind of like the same
things I definitely am guilty of it
myself and it might be can be fun today
to focus on kind of like the untyped
makeup maybe some smaller brands or just
makeup look I said that I don't see
being talked about a lot some of these
things will be a new to me so some will
be like first impressions all of them
are so it's not like a first impression
type of video or anything like that but
I do have a few new goodies it to me but
I'm excited because everything that I
pulled I feel like maybe could be
considered unhype or just like not used
a lot on YouTube so I'm excited to film
it I don't do makeup tutorials a ton I
just recently started posting them again
if I thought maybe I could slip in some
get writings with me as well because I
kind of like the Bible but get ready
with me it's a little bit more on the
casual sides and like a regular makeup
tutorial I do want to say thank you guys
wanted for clicking on this video if you
have not subscribed to it I hope that
you'll consider subscribing before you
go I do most a video every single day so
if you enjoy daily content make sure to
subscribe before you leave I also have
20kg boys going on right now on YouTube
and Instagram so those will be linked
down below but why don't we go ahead and
get started with this get ready with me
okay I got my ears on I'm going to start
with my eyes first and I'm going to use
this eyeshadow palette from soap &amp;amp; Glory
I have never tried any soap &amp;amp; Glory
makeup before so I'm very excited this
is their perfect 10 so it's a limited
edition ten shade eyeshadow palette and
when you open it up this is what it
looks like it does have a mirror this
was sent to me from a subscriber friend
which is so cool because I guys have
never tried soap &amp;amp; Glory makeup I go to
the site I don't even know what shades
I'm going to use today it's been such a
crazy day if you follow me on snap I'm
filming this on Friday and getting my
Friday video up was like a disaster I
had to like redo everything and it took
I were to get up so I'm now three
o'clock I don't usually film this Lee
I'm usually editing at this time so I'm
like feeling all sorts of stress but
just come with a little brush I'm going
to set that to the side for now I really
didn't have any brushes that I thought
I'm unhype I'm pretty brush loyal so the
brushes aren't gonna really count and
the whole like on type 2 thing that we
got going on but looking into the
palette I think I'm first going to come
in with the shade toasty Oh Chelsea
looks like a max light brown so I'm just
using my Sigma e-40 and I'm going to put
this into the crease I do have my eyes
primed with my ELF primer that I love so
much and then I also did put a little
bit of translucent powder on it to set
the concealer I like this shade it
almost has like a mob undertone as well
looks really pretty it looks to be
pretty pigmented so far glory I believe
you can find it in Ulta I know I've seen
it at like my Walgreens - so anywhere
that I can find it I will have some
links down below to this eyeshadow
palette I do kind of wish there was one
more like darker matte shade in here but
there's really not so I'm trying to
decide I might just do some shimmer in
my crease will just totally fine it's
not something that I do all the time but
it looks like some of these darker
shades are more shimmer colors that grab
out the shade chalky chalky chalky just
going to use a blending brush from the
morphe copper dreams cover Rose brush
set and I'm just going to focus this one
on the outer part of my eye but then
also kind of slightly blend it in and
see what that looks like so it doesn't
look to be too overwhelming on the outer
which is good I'm just going to build it
up a little bit here so I'm just working
on building it up because it's not super
super pigmented
I mean sometimes with darker shades that
doesn't make me mad because it can be
because it can be harder to blend out
but I'm just
taking my time building it up and
blending it out but I actually really
like the way that it's looking so far so
that's good I didn't even swatch any of
these I had seen a couple people do like
a no swatch challenge where they're
doing a makeup tutorial like a first
impression style but they're not
watching anything and I'm like honestly
that's kind of like though the way I
always do it I don't even think about it
I just go right in and start seeing what
things look on my eyes so that's what I
did with this guy today but I like that
it's a little bit smokier than I thought
maybe I was intending for but I like the
way that it came out so going through
Pete on the other eye let's take these
second shade right here in minke and put
that on into a short shader brush the
e20 from sigma and see what this one
looks like I'm going to pop this onto
the lid more towards the inner part of
the eye I can decide if I wanted to do a
mattr shimmer here with this palette has
mostly shimmers I wouldn't say this is
like the most pigmented overwhelming
shimmer I've ever seen but I kind of
like how it looks and I don't want to
use a liquid actually except I kind of
kind of like it like this and I'm really
only putting the shadow like right on
the inner part of my eye and not really
going past the center I'm really liking
the way this is looking so far I mean
I'm kind of having to play with the
shadows a little bit and spend a little
bit of time you know building them up
and such but I don't think this is that
I should oppose so far at all and each
of the shapes ideas I thought were
really pretty so my morphe brush and
just kind of lightly sweep it along
everything so for eyeliner I just got
sent a bag with some Catrice makeup
which I'm really excited for because
I've never tried anything from Catrice
so I pulled out their Jill eyeliner I
want to give this a try I believe is
Justin black yet the black Jack was a
jack black gel eyeliner
that is the name of it no I'm just going
to make a little wing I don't want it to
be super overpowering so I'm actually
not using lashes today because I think I
have a Catrice mascara as well that I'm
trying out let me use my favorite winged
liner brush it's the eo6 from sigma
school it's called their winged liner
brush
so it applies very smooth nice and
pigmented I don't think it's as black as
the Sigma gel liner but it's still
pretty dark blacks already making the
liners thicker as a knife anticipated
that that happens often them okay I
think so far so good on the liner
looking looking good to me we're not
easily again I just I don't think it's
at the blackest eyeliner I've ever used
but that doesn't really bother me sips
so that is pretty awesome I'm going to
go ahead and do the other eye and then
we're going to work on the face a little
bit switching to the face I have some
items here from amazing cosmetics I
don't feel like I hear a lot of people
talking about amazing cosmetics I myself
wasn't super familiar with them until
they sent me a package with some of
their items a couple months back and
there's a lot of things that I actually
really enjoyed from them so I wanted to
include a few other products in here so
first I'm going to use their anti-aging
of face primaries probably see me use
this before if you follow me on
Instagram where I share allows my makeup
tutorials but I really really like this
primer it's more of a silicone based
primer which I don't always love but
it's kind of like a primer and a
moisturizer in one it does say it has
vitamins in plant extracts its
anti-aging to hydrate and protect the
skin and as a primer and moisturizers
are all-in-one I do really like it I
find myself reaching for it quite a bit
and amazing cosmetics can be found at
Ulta so I'll have some links for all
these products down below but first
foundation I'm going to use their
amazing concealer foundation and I'm in
the shade light golden so as this one is
pretty liquidy so I do shake it up
before I apply it and it says you know
concealer foundation but I've only ever
used it as foundation I'm going to use
one of the motive brushes from royal and
langnickel my friend Mickey sent me some
of their brushes and I really enjoyed
this foundation when I liked all of the
brushes the face set that she sent the
foundation brush is definitely a space
and then liking this foundation for the
summer too because it's more of a it's a
medium coverage but I would say more
light to medium coverage and I kind of
like light to medium right now and
summertime how's it not be you know so
heavy on my skin when I'm outside in the
hot weather is like the finish that it
gave us and I just think it looks nice
on the face like it doesn't crack up it
doesn't sit funny it doesn't show lines
or anything like that just a nice
foundation for concealer I have their
amazing hydrate concealer this concealer
is interesting to me they did send along
two different ones one is there
I can't think it was called it might
just be called their amazing concealer I
can't remember but it is like so sick
and so full coverage I know they say a
lot of like makeup artists will use that
on celebrities because it like hides
anything but it's like way too much for
me on my under eyes I really struggle to
use that one so I don't know if you like
really really full coverage that
concealer you would probably love that
one but this is not really for me so I
reach towards this one more my shade is
in ivory for an interesting that is
called a hydrate concealer because I
actually think it's kind of dry so I
don't reach for this a ton I do like how
light it is folks I really like the
light under eyes we could go down the
center of my face as well but it is a
little more drying to me which I don't
love but I like the coverage that it
gives and it looks nice once blended out
but I just kind of have to be careful
with how much I use have if I'm dealing
with any sort of like dry patches on my
under eyes which I can deal with I can't
use this concealer because it just like
clings to that so I wanted to point that
one out but I still think is a decent
concealer just stepping out my favorite
and I would recommend the primer and the
foundation over the concealer from
amazing cosmetics and I am using another
brush from that Moda brush set from
royal and langnickel
to blend out the concealer I just set
the under eyes with some a translucent
powder and then for bronzer I'm going to
use this one from cargo it is one of
their swimmable water resistant bronzer
I'm not sure if there's only one shade
because I can't find a shade name on
here this is what it looks like it looks
really pretty I love bronzer I don't
think I have ever used Cargo cosmetics
I feel like I don't hear a lot of people
talk about them sometimes they hear
things about their eyeshadow palettes
but I don't really hear a whole lot so
I'm excited to try this bronzer carbo
going to try Ulta as well I'm going to
use my morphe m53 zero and see what this
looks like again I didn't watch this so
I really I'm not sure about it I'm Tony
I just with no makeup as I'm trying it
out on camera
look I just go right in I don't I don't
really slash things first so okay so
books so far I think that's looking
really pretty it's easy to blend it
looks nice okay so I have built it up a
little bit I think that gives a nice
bronzy look it's not like too orange or
anything on the skin just a nice bronze
tried anything from Carvel cosmetics or
any of the brands that I've mentioned
like would you have favorites or
anything that you would recommend from
any of these brands so you think I would
need to check out because I would love
to know so I really like that bronzer so
far I think it looks pretty good on a be
to apply easy to blend Dallas so I like
it and I'm going to top off camera and
do my brows because I don't have
anything new or like unhype brow wise
that I could do on camera so I'll just
do those off-camera and come back to
finish off the lips I didn't realize
that my camera wasn't filming so I
missed the step but I wanted to finish
off my eyes and I don't have a new or
like unhype eyeliner so I just put some
of my pier on point liner in my
waterline and then I went back into the
palette and I grossed out they shade
toasty which I put in the crease and
then also nude comer right here and I
just used a little brush that came with
the palette and I put those on it to my
lower lash line and that's all I did
before I realized that the camera was
into filming but then I'm going to go
ahead into the palette as well and grab
out some of this first shade in moon
mist she's going to use the other end of
the brush and I'm going to put some of
this on the brow bone and then also on
my inner corner and for mascara I have
from Catrice their repertoire 24 hour
extreme
you mascaras that some please fun
packaging let's go ahead and see what
the wand oh the wand is super
interesting here is what the wand looks
like and let's go ahead and give this a
shot
lashes with one coat I think it's
working pretty good it's definitely made
them longer I wanted to say right off
the bat this just became like my new
favorite mascara but something looks
pretty good okay so the more I look at
it the more head should kind of really
suit like that mascara so I've been
trying to do some more mascara reasons
that have always just wearing false
lashes because I know I know that I do
wear lashes a lot so I've been trying to
test out mascaras too so I can give them
you know feedback and reviews and so far
this is looking pretty good so yeah
those the Catrice rocket or mascara so
for blush I'm going to use the silky
touch blush from essence again I feel
like I am hearing more about essence I
think it's a newer brand to Ulta this is
in the shade babydoll which is a really
nice pink but I have used this before
and it is so good again my friend Mickey
sendest won this one to me and I was
like that is a really nice blush and
they're available at Ulta and these
bushes are two and ninety nine to nine
and they are so pretty so pigmented like
you need a light hand the first time I
use it I win and kind of heavier and I
was like okay you really don't need to
do that because this blush definitely
shows up and I just think they are so so
pretty so if you guys have any favorite
products from essence let me know so
totally buy more from that brand or
highlight I am so excited to use this
one from Jake at beauty look how
gorgeous that is
this is the you go girl baked
highlighter in Bella Rose and folks ID
to try it I'm going to use my Lexy 522
the tapered highlight brush my friend
Mickey sent me this one as well and I've
just been waiting it to try it out on
camera I've been so curious about this
one so go ahead and see Jake at beauty
is also available Ulta I looked up this
highlighter it is $8 $9 I believe it
that it was so the course will be listed
down below that is pretty I love look
that you're doesn't shift to it is so
pretty
mmm is so fun it comment it's giving me
sassy grape vibes from the unassociated
Beverly Hills sweets glow kit
that one is a little bit more on the
purple side but still like this close-up
like a purple iridescent and it's so
pretty very pigmented like oh this is
awesome I'm only going to highlight my
cheekbones sometimes I'll do like the
center my nose and stuff but when I'm
doing an iridescent highlight I
typically don't because I think that it
was kind of strange but that's just me
so I'm just going to go ahead and leave
the highlight just on my cheekbones but
that was really pretty the finish also
look I'm going to use a liquid lipstick
this is from Christina and cosmetics and
it is in the shade selfie so I have
mentioned Christina and cosmetics in the
past she saw me through Instagram and
sent me some of her lipsticks I really
used her eyeshadow palette as well it's
definitely like the girlboss an indie
