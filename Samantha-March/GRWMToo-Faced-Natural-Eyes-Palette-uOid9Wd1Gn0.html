hey guys welcome back it to my channel
today is going to be my first get ready
with me video and basically I'm just
going to be doing my hair and makeup on
camera I'm not gonna be doing anything
like my clothes are things like that
because truly I just don't really know
how to film those aspects yet so it's
just going to be how I did this makeup
look and this hair I mean my hair is
just a side braid it's very simple go to
hair if I don't want to leave my hair
down but I don't want to do something
like curling it this is basically the
look that I get because i'm not a big
pony tail person i'm more of the side
braid a simple i used the two-faced
natural eye palette now it is an older
palette so i will still try to find
their natural eye palette and link it
below but i think it the packaging will
be different just because my package is
so much older but you will see that has
been a much-loved palette a lot of those
colors are very loved and I've even had
paint on a few of them so that was the
palette that I used but basically I'm
filming this on a day where I'm just
gonna go hang out with my girlfriends
all day we're really not going to do
much of anything I don't even know if
we'll be seen in public but the options
that we are I wanted to have a some
makeup done but I didn't want to like go
full out and do anything super wild and
crazy just in case we don't do anything
because then it'd be like well that was
a bummer so I decided to film it and
because I think we're going I mean I
have like just I comfy casual sweater on
we're in October here in Iowa and it's
been pretty chilly this week so I just
have a sweater on and that's about it
and I'm just going to wear leggings and
probably some flip flops because I'm not
ready to put those away yet but that's
basically what my clothes I mean it's
not very exciting so I didn't thank you
guys what do we do film it but I mean I
can post an outfit photo if you guys
would really want me to I mean you just
let me know but yeah if you would like
to see how I got this hair and makeup
look and you want to get ready with me
for this weekend day then please keep
watching
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you

ok so I hope you guys enjoyed that video
hopefully I can make it quick the
editing part of these videos always kind
of scare me because I really don't feel
comfortable or know what i'm doing yet
but hopefully i can work some magic and
get it good for you i hope you guys like
this again it was my first get ready
with me and i know i didn't go into all
the details like my outfit and shoes and
things like that but hopefully you still
enjoyed seeing the hair and makeup part
of it i know the hair is probably so
simple i'm really not good with hair
full disclaimer I'm very very recently
bought my first curling iron and
actually learned how to curl my hair I
mean within the past two or three years
and I'm 28 I just now learned I can't do
anything crazy yet like French braiding
though I'm trying really hard to learn I
just do not get the concept of it and
honestly I don't wear my hair up a lot I
don't think I've talked about this in
some of my earlier videos but um my ears
stick out so I don't really wear a lot
of hairstyle that show off my ears
because I feel like they're like look at
this video a thumbs up if you liked it
if you want to see more makeup tutorials
or more get ready with me I am planning
I'm doing the next makeup tutorial i
think is going to be like a family
appropriate holiday card type of makeup
tutorial but if you guys have any other
ideas or suggestions for me please let
me know or if you have a certain look
maybe that you want to see for the
holiday card please just let me know i
was trying to decide between like a
really warm fall luck and then actually
more of like a cool tone look because
I've been obsessed with a cool town look
lately and I just keep wearing it I've
gotten a lot of great feedback from my
Instagram pictures from it so I've been
trying to decide so if you want to
comment below and let me know that would
be great if you do have any other video
suggestions or recommendations for me
please do just let me know now I gotta
get out the door and start my day I hope
you all have a wonderful weekend please
subscribe before you leave and I will
catch you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
