with another beauty video and it's
another brand review video and it is all
on lipsticks so I'm really excited to do
this one because it's for a company that
I really enjoy and I found here on
YouTube it's probably another one of
those things i think it was makeup geek
that i mentioned that there is a good
chance i never would have found them had
it not been for youtube and Gerard
cosmetics is pretty much the same thing
I would see a lot of other youtubers
talking about the brand and their
lipsticks seemed really affordable and I
really like the colors and they are kind
of like a bh cosmetics that i mentioned
how like they continually have fantastic
sales so I follow Gerard cosmetics on
Instagram and I just kind of wait until
I see that they have a sale going on and
then i buy from them and they have
lipsticks and they have lip glosses and
then they have a few other makeup
products as well I know they just came
out with two highlighters and I love
highlighters and the highlighters look
pretty good so I have my eye on them too
so i have this is my like a little
lipstick holder that i have down here
but all these in the front row don't
know if you'll be able to see them okay
but i have five lipsticks from jared
cosmetics and they come in and these
little like gold hopefully you can see
it okay once again I mean Iowa just all
that wants to do here is rain and storm
and everything like that so I'm
recording with the flash on again so I'm
like blinding myself looking into this
light but hope you guys can see that ok
that's what the that's what the
packaging looks like and then I'm just
going to kind of go through each
lipstick and I'll do a swatch of them
for you guys and then hopefully at the
end I want to do actual swatches on my
lips I only have five lipstick so it
shouldn't be like that hard or take too
much time but I'm going to try to do
that for you guys as well I will say
Gerard cosmetics all their lipstick
are nineteen dollars which really isn't
bad but if you can get them on sale you
can get them for an even better price
the last time I put an order in through
them they had like a 2 420 going on so
you know it's basically like buy one get
one free but they have like 34 35 and I
know they have a four pack bundle every
once in a while too so just watch for
those sales if you're like me and you
love sales and coupons and you live
discounts because they will have them
make sure you follow them on Instagram
too I will leave their website
information and all of their social
media links in the description box below
for you guys I think they have 15
different lipstick shades now when I put
my first order in through them which is
maybe like last summer they really
didn't have like a whole lot of color
options and all of a sudden I know they
just put out two not that long ago
because I ordered one of their new ones
are underground through it and I think
they'd put out underground and madison
avenue and i ordered two from there and
then just a few weeks ago i saw that
they just released like three more or
something like that I'm just like cool
you go so they're constantly adding new
ones and like I said they have lipsticks
and lip glosses and oh I have two of
their lip glosses as well so i'll be
sure to put those lip glosses on for you
as well that is my little intro and i
will get into the swatch l0 first
lipstick that i'm going to swatch is
buttercup and Buttercup is this like
really light pinkish nude color I love
buttercup it's I would say it's my
favorite of all the short cosmetics
lipsticks that I have so it's just this
real light pink and I'm actually it's
what i'm wearing on my lips right now
just that no glass no lip liner or
anything i just have butter cup on and I
got butter cup because I'm a huge fan of
Jacqueline hills and i believe i've
mentioned her in a video before but she
actually created buttercup which I just
think is really cool
very big youtuber I think she'd just hit
two million subscribers not too long ago
but she has created Buttercup and then a
few other from Gerard cosmetics that i
actually have because she has a bundle
i'll leave a link to the bundle below to
as well as every lipstick that i
mentioned in here but I bought her
bundle but I bought a lipstick and two
lip glosses and then later she came out
with buttercup and so I bought this one
as well but I thought that was so cool
it's so inspiring to see someone who you
know just kind of starts on YouTube kind
of like all the rest of us started on
YouTube we just kind of help on here and
kind of see what happens and where we go
and now she's creating make up with
these companies and I know she's done
eyeshadow palettes as well with other
companies and it's just amazing I mean
someone pointed out to me on Twitter I
think it was that I say you go a lot and
I was just getting ready to say like you
go Jaclyn you go and someone's like you
say that a lot and I'm like ah I mean
there's worse things to say right right
buttercup like I said probably my
favorite out of my five lipsticks that I
have you can wear it with anything it's
so good for the spring and summer I just
I wear it all the time it's so
appropriate up for whatever event it is
you're doing you can darken it up by
putting a lip liner on it you can make
it shinier by putting a lip gloss on it
it's just a very versatile so that is
buttercup the next one that i have is
underground and i'll give you a story
about underground because underground is
kind of like this grayish nude yeah well
little on the gray side oh this is i can
tell this is newer because it still has
quite the point to it but that's next to
buttercup so it's kind of like this
darkish grayish color and that might
sound weird and i totally understand
that but I was seeing on YouTube people
were wearing such a beautiful gray on
their lips not like
grey like they didn't look dead or
anything like that but I just kept
thinking I was like who are you wearing
because I love that and what they were
wearing was cashmere by lime crime and I
had it I have like a whole makeup list
of things that i want to buy and
purchase but you know obviously I can't
just buy whatever I want whenever I feel
like it because let's get real we have
some bark of that so it's been on my
list for so long and I was finally
finally going to order this lipstick and
i went online and i was kind of like
looking around just reading like
different things about Lime Crime trying
to figure out should I order another
lipstick with it and all of a sudden it
popped up on my computer that there was
this whole scandal with lime crime and I
won't really get too much into it
because you know it's a very negative
situation that happened and obviously
I'm not a part of it and nothing
affected me personally because I haven't
put an order through yet but it's a lot
going on with that company and so I
decided that I did not want to order
with them and then it was like emoji sad
face because I was like well I really
really wanted that lipstick and so I
started looking around I was trying to
find a dupe for cashmere I was watching
other people's youtube videos that said
that they had a dupe and I found one and
I can't remember which brand it was but
it was only a limited edition so by the
time I found it it was already out of
stock and I was just so super bummed but
I crossed it off my wish list and I just
kept moving on with life because that's
what you have to do and then I saw drug
cosmetics came out with this underground
and it was that grayish color that
Kashmir is and I got so excited and I
tweeted to Gerard cosmetics and I said
is this somewhat of a dupe for Lancome
Kashmir and they responded back right
away and you know they said yes it's
that that gray undertone and I was like
perfect and then the two for 20 sale
came up and I was like let's do it and I
bought it and I'm so freaking happy with
it you guys I love it i will say because
it is more on this like cool tone grey
side I do wear a lip liner with it
well um it's by Mac so this is what I
where I can kind of I can put it next to
so this little line right here next to
it that's the lip liner that I wear with
it because if I just wear under ground
plane it is a little too on the dead
looking side for me and for my skin tone
I'm sure some people probably don't need
to wear a lip liner but I'm not one of
those so I just use whirl by Mac and
then I put the underground over it and
it just I love it I love the color and I
love how it turns out so I'm probably
not a shade that's going to be for
everybody but it's one of my new
favorite lipsticks to wear and I get so
many compliments on it and because it is
so different it just kind of stands out
and people will ask me about itself the
next one that i have is tequila sunrise
and i ordered this was in my very first
order i'm pretty sure it's this like
orangie poorly and that's what that one
looks like and what I first got it and I
opened it up I was like oh this is
orange how do I wear an orange lipstick
I've never been an orange lipstick
person and but when I actually put it on
it comes out much more coral and pinkish
then it actually does orange so
especially I brought this with me when
me and my husband went to the Bahamas we
went in January and I brought it with me
and I wore it all the time because it
was such like perfect Beach lipstick and
I know that now that we're getting into
the summer months I'm going to be
wearing it a lot more because i think
it's just such that pretty light coral
pinkish color so if you see it and you
think like oh no that's orange like
don't be alarmed because at least on
someone with my skin tone which i'm
fairly fair but I wore it in the Bahamas
even when I had more of a tan and it
still came out more to the pink coral
side more than to the orange coral side
but that make sense and then another one
that I have is one from the Jacqueline
hill bundled the original bundle that I
/
just and it is 1995 and she had a whole
grunge 90s video makeup tutorials
actually did with it and then she
introduced this 1995 and I'm really like
super bummed about this lipstick because
I don't know if you can see like this
massive crack in the lid I was driving
in the car with my dog and like two
months after I bought this lipstick and
I looked behind me and she had this in
her mouth and she cracked the cap which
has caused the lipstick to dry out a lot
so it's kind of harder for me to apply
because it's so dried out now because of
the cap and I was just so bummed because
i love this lipstick and this is another
one that's different and so i get so
many compliments on it and I just
remember getting ready for Halloween
last year and I was talking to my
girlfriend I was like I'm not sure which
look color to wear and she goes what
about that cool red one with that you
have that one looks really good I was
like oh 1995 but so it's this one over
here so this one it's it's kind of hard
to describe because I thought it would
be like more red but it's almost like
more of like a brownish deep red if that
makes any sense I love it like i said
it's super unique I don't need to wear a
lip liner with this one sometimes I put
a gloss over and just kind of make it a
little bit more shiny but honestly I
really like the more matte look to it
but this one is so good I kind of really
just do want to bite the bullet and
order a new one so it can go back all I
jarred cosmetics lipsticks that I own
are very creamy to put on and then I
have this one and it's like hard to put
on because my darn dog oh but it's
really really good one I really love
1995 as well and the last one that I
have from droid cosmetics is a fire
engine and if you can't guess it is a
red lipstick and this is one of my brand
new ones I got this one when I ordered
underground so so this one is fire
engine
and I will say about fire engine when I
ordered it I was in the market for just
a really like dark deep red and I was
going I had a bachelorette party where I
was a flapper and I just want it like
pretty subtle makeup but then like
really bright red lips and so I order
fire engine for that reason and I
honestly don't think it's super red I
had to put on a lot of coats and I
thought it was almost coming out a
little bit more towards like a pinkish
red side then like the vibrant red side
so I didn't have a lip liner at the time
maybe a lip a red lip liner would have
helped me so I don't know I and that's
the only time I've really used it was
that I still use it for the bachelorette
party and just kind of rolled with it
but even maybe putting a red gloss on
top of it might have helped but if
you're in the market for just like red
lips you want that red lip I'm not going
to say that fire engine is going to be
the best bet for you but it's still a
very pretty red color I still got a lot
of compliments on it but um not my
favorite one out of the whole group just
because it wasn't exactly what I was
looking for but still a good lipstick
and then I have two of their lip glosses
and these were both in the jaclyn hill
palette so it came with buttercream rose
hill and then 1995 i believe were what
was in the 3 bundle and now she also has
the butter cup lipstick this is
buttercream which is the lip gloss and
this is really really beautiful my poor
hand is like all sorts of swatch dub
this one right here is the buttercream
so very similar to the buttercup
lipstick I probably should have put it
next to Buttercup because I wear it
Buttercup and butter cream together all
the time it's just that real light pink
nude color one kind of cool thing I
don't know if you'll be able to see it
on camera but the drug cosmetics this is
what
it looks like but then it actually has
little lights right here so your wand is
lit up and then it also comes with a
mirror so when you're out and it's dark
out or maybe you're in a car and the
lights aren't on and it's nighttime you
can pull this out and you have your
mirror right here and then you also have
a lighted wand so I really enjoy that
about the lip glosses and I really
really love this lip gloss the other one
that she put out was rose hill and rose
hill is more on the reddish side this
one is rose hill so the two are next to
each other the two lip glosses that I
have so yeah this one is more on the
reddish side I'd say it's it leans more
unlike the reddish pink side times I do
wear this over 1995 and I really like it
but I honestly where Rose Hill alone a
lot and I really liked that as well I
don't think I've mixed it with anything
else that I could compare like looking
out the swatches of my hand like have I
mixed it with anything else both the lip
glosses I really like so you know if
you're a supporter of jaclyn hill i I
think ordering the bundle is just a
really cool and fun idea that she came
up with droid cosmetics are else I i
really enjoy both of these lip glosses
they have a ton of lip glosses like in
all different colors and in all
different shades like whatever lip gloss
you need Gerard cosmetics is probably
going to have like I would be surprised
if they didn't so these are the only two
that I have right now like sticky lips
and now that their lip glosses are
sticky but just to meet lip glosses in
general have like the sticky consistency
or like from outside my hair is going to
get on my lips and it just kind of
annoys me so not a huge lip gloss person
in general but I just knew that I wanted
to order these two and I really like
them
so those are all of my drugs cosmetics
lipsticks and lip glosses I really hope
you enjoyed this video and you found it
helpful if you are going to be shopping
