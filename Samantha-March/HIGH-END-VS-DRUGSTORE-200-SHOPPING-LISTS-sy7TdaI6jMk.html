today's video is going to be a little
bit different I've been getting so many
excellent video suggestions as of lately
and one that I kept seeing requested is
to kind of film a video doing like a
shopping trip like saying hey I have a
two hundred dollar gift card to Sephora
and this is what I'm gonna spend so I've
had that idea on my video film list or
for a while but then the other day I saw
my friend Robin from Robins cup of tea
do a similar video idea to this where
she has a two hundred dollar gift card
imaginary but she wants to compare what
it would be like spending that two
hundred dollars at Sephora and then or
high-end and then spending it at Ulta or
drugstore and I thought that was a
really fun idea and I definitely wanted
to do that so that's are going to be
doing today I will have Robins video
Alyssa down below of course and I
encourage you to check it out but if you
would like to see my shopping list and
how they compare with a Sephora high-end
makeup with two altered drugstore makeup
if I have $200 to eat what am I getting
let me go ahead and jump into the video
already so first up I have my list here
from Sephora and then also Beauty lish
because when I was thinking about it I
first just thought Sephora cuz you know
it's like our mothership and then I
thought you know there's been a few
items that I really want to purchase
from a beauty lush as of lately so I'm
you know I'm just gonna have this be
high end and then drugstore affordable
so I went through my loves list on the
Sephora website and picked out a few
items that I'd want to get I have a Kat
Von D one of her like studded lip creme
lipsticks hald bow and arrow and I love
bow and arrow in her everlasting liquid
lipstick formula and I really enjoy her
regular lipstick formula I feel like I
was just talking about it oh it's in my
monthly favorites if I haven't put that
video up yet her lipsticks are in my
monthly favorites and I really want to
pick it up and that's $19 so I thought
yes should I put it in my bag here we go
and then I've been really wanting to get
this like face asset from Make Up For
Ever you have some different shades out
right now where you can kind of
customize your own face palette
they have contour shades and blush it's
and highlight shades and then they have
where you can buy each of the pans
separately and they are magnetic pans
and I actually do already own one of the
contour shades so you can get the
magnetic pans or if you get the
palate to actually put the pans in you
actually get a bit of a discount so I
went through and picked out a couple
shades for myself to make a three pan
palette which is a $35 picked out a
contour a blush and a highlight shade so
the three shades a plus the palette just
to put them all in are $35 which I
didn't think that was a bad deal right
at all and then next up from a Sephora I
wanted to pick up the Clinique take the
day off balm I love that I'm saying like
I'm gonna pick this up this is imaginary
like what's the again let's just say I
don't have the $200 gift cards I'm just
say if I did this is what I'd be buying
but I have the Clinique take the day a
balm cleansing balm on my list as well I
actually almost picked this up when I
did my Sephora haul the other day
because I did do a Sephora and Ulta
makeup haul so I'll have that one listed
down below and I did have a gift card to
Sephora but I had both of the Willa
Hendrickson facial so no scrub in my
cart and then also the Clinique take the
day off balm and I was like you only
have some 120 on your gift card girl
like you've got to choose which one you
want and I went with it Lilith
Hendrickson but if I somehow got another
gift card up in here now I'm doing
another haul I'm gonna get that clinic
take the day off cleansing balm finally
so those are the three items that I was
gonna get from Sephora and then I moved
over to bootylicious there's been so
many items from Charlotte Tilbury that
I've really wanted to pick up lately but
it is it is a pricier brand but you can
find them on Beauty lish and I know
people say really good things about
Beauty lush customer service really good
things about their shipping and also
they do have kind of like a payment plan
program but I know people really enjoy I
don't think they have a reward system
like Sephora does but they actually have
like say you make a $100 purchase or
something you can pay like $20 a month
until it's paid off instead of paying it
all up front I know a lot of people say
that they take advantage of that so
that's pretty cool I guess I have made
one purchase from Beauty lish I did the
beauty lash lucky bag and I do have an
unboxing video of that if you'd be
interested in seeing but I haven't made
a purchase for product from a brand if
that makes sense
so first up from Charlotte Tilbury I
have one of her Hot Lips lipsticks and
k'kaw and this is $34 I feel like
everybody has this nude lipstick
everybody everybody with me I mean
like why I need this nude lipstick to
feel like I hear really good things
about it and whenever I see someone
wearing it and they say they're wearing
the k'kaw from Charlotte Tilbury I'm
like I want that one so that definitely
went on my list and then also one of the
cheek to cheek it's a really interesting
looking I'll be trying to add in the
best photos I can of course but it's a
really interesting allocating blush I
really want that and I feel like I see
people using it quite a bit
and I hear good things about it that's
$40 felt like that's pretty crazy I
definitely want to be buying all this
with some sort of gift card open here
and then the last one is what I think
maybe has been on my Charlotte Tilbury
like to want list for the longest time
and that is her can I read my own
handwriting oh my goodness it is her
airbrush a flawless finish powder I
thought it said curb something it says
airbrush my handwriting is no joke but
it is a finishing powder I feel like I
just heard somebody else mentioning this
and like a like a best of beauty 2017
video and I was like I want that powder
so bad that's $45 for a finishing powder
which I don't use those every single day
only some days I do is I'm like $45
that's a lot of money but I mean if
we're talking that I got a gift card and
I gotta be spending this kind of money
then I want to pick that up because I'm
super interested in it and I hear really
good things about it so with those three
items from Sephora and then three items
from Beauty lish the total of six items
but the makeup forever is technically
technically four items three face
powders and palettes though mm-hmm
say what you will but that cost equals
two hundred and two dollars and fifty
cents and I didn't include shipping a
Sephora would be free shipping because I
am a Rouge over there so I know that
shipping would be free and then beauty
alert I'm not exactly sure about their
shipping but we're just I'm just going
off the subtotals here and that's two
hundred and two dollars and fifty cents
for those items I was like wow that did
not take me long at all so pick that out
like I thought I would be there for I
don't know a little bit longer than two
minutes but it did not take me very long
night to pick out my high
to make up Alonza so that is what I was
thinking for my high end and then moving
over to a Ford well I did Ulta I went to
brands websites in general just anything
that I've been running that's considered
more affordable and of course with Ulta
I did the affordable side of Ulta not
the brands that are there that are also
considered high-end so I look at my list
here the first thing that I have on
there is a Maybelline lipstick it's one
of their new like matte color lipsticks
I for some reason I didn't write down
the full name but I wrote on the shade I
picked out which is called loyalist and
it's a nine dollars and 49 cents I feel
like I've been hearing really good
things about the new Maybelline
lipsticks also like their lip glosses
I've been hearing good things about but
I was going through and I decided just
because I am more of a matte lip girl
that that was the one that I picked out
so that's the first item I put on my
list next up I also have from a flower
beauty one of their miracle matte
lipsticks and the shade I picked out was
nude blush this is $9.99 I feel like
I've been seeing a lot of people wearing
the flower Beauty matte lipsticks lately
I've been seeing it in videos and I've
had a lot of people ask me if I would
try them out to review them and do a top
5 bottom 5 of a flower beauty I
mentioned that in a past video and a lot
of people said they wanted to see that
but I want to get a few more items from
them so I could do more of like a
complete top 5 bottom 5 if that makes
sense
but I would definitely put one of the
matte lipsticks on there also the
Catrice and mascara the rocket or
mascara at $7.99 I actually have it it
would be a repurchase for me but I'm
almost out of it and it's I already have
it flag on Ulta that I want to get a
repurchase of it I also picked out the
Revlon brow pencil for $8.99
so many people have been recommending
this brow pencil to me I can't remember
videos in but I asked for affordable
brow product suggestions and I think the
number one answer that came in was from
Revlon so I picked out the brow pencil
to add to my list I also put on here
from elf the elf and heart highlight for
$8 it's a really beautiful kind of like
split pan highlight I've been eyeing it
I can't remember if it went out of stock
at Ulta or if it just now came on the
Aalto website and hadn't been before
because it's not a brand new release but
I've been seeing it in stock on the
Alpha website lately and
like that highlight looks really pretty
I also put on here The True Match Lumi a
Foundation which is $11.99 this would be
another repurchase for me and you keep
hearing me say in videos I need that
foundation back in my collection even
though I have so many foundations right
now I really want that one back in my
collection because it's one of my
absolute favorites so if I gotta give
fair Delta and I'm buying a couple
things I'm gonna be repurchasing that
foundation for sure okay so then I
thought it was funny because we have six
items already right so we have six items
already on our affordable list compared
to the six items that we had for
high-end and the total cost just just I
thought it would be interesting to see
is 56 dollars and 45 cents we're not
even to the halfway mark and I already
have as many items as I did for my high
outside I was like oh oh dear we're
gonna keep it rolling over here so also
another repurchase that I would want to
get is the Maybelline fit me concealer
this is $6.99 it's one of my favorite
concealers and I am out of it I think I
called it I called it she's gone but I
definitely want another one then I went
over to the colour-pop website and I was
browsing for a while but honestly there
wasn't a ton because even though this is
imaginary I still wanted to have it be
realistic to me I didn't want to just be
adding things to add things and when I
do have a gift card I am someone who
like I want to be really sure about my
purchases because it almost just like I
don't it's harder for me to part with my
gift card money than it is my own money
for some reason and I know I mentioned
that in a past video and so many people
wrote it and said you were the same way
I'm like thank you because I feel it
that's super weird why would I want to
hold on to my gift card versus my own it
just doesn't even make any sense but
telling us why yeah yeah but one thing
that I've always wanted to try from
colour-pop is one of their face duos the
one that I picked out is called done
deal and that's sixteen dollars and you
get a this one was a blush and a
highlight I believe there used to be
another one that I wanted more and I
think it had a bronzer and a blush in it
but I didn't see that one on there which
kind of bummed me out but the done deal
one did look pretty and like I said that
one's sixteen dollars and then I also
wanted to pick up another color pop no
filter concealer because I picked up
shade mmm like a month or two or so ago
and it's called light neutral and it's
what it's like white on me like white
why it's way too light I can't use it on
my under eyes unless I'm kind of like
mixing it in with a darker concealer
which this doesn't happen a lot so I
really do want to give it like an actual
try because so many people say that they
really enjoy it and at $6 I was like I
can get another shade it's fine
and then also then I went back to the
Ulta website I picked out some
Neutrogena wipes I think I'll click it
click to pack of them which is 1249 I
almost always have these wipes in my
collection some for my face and then I
also use them for swatches I always like
to have makeup wipes on hand for when
I'm doing scotches and stuff and I only
have like four wipes left and that's it
out of my whole collection so I
definitely need to be repurchasing some
more and those are just my favorite so I
picked up the Neutrogena ones and then
also I wasn't for sure on this one but I
I felt like it was affordable
it's from hemp and it's like their
gradual self tanner I hear my friend Liv
from love loves her makeup talked about
this all the time and whenever she says
she's self tanned using the hemp's she
looks so good so I've been adding this
one for quite some time it's 2395 and so
at first I was like I don't know if
that's more expensive but kind of
looking at him send general an alpha
website they still seemed fairly
affordable so I thought maybe this one
was just more expensive because it's not
just a lotion like it's also a
self-tanner as well I also put a
Maybelline brow pencil on there for
$7.99 this would be a repurchase because
I'm so fond of my Maybelline brow pencil
I just mentioned this in my makeup
products that got dethroned then I
completely just throw into a benefit
goof proof brow pencil and yeah I'm
gonna I'm going to need another one of
that I can't not have them in my
collection anymore it's whatever my
brows today and I just love it also I
put on here once again can I read my
handwriting oh do oh I thought it said
oh so I was like those of colors that's
not considered a portable the dual lash
adhesive I need another one of the clear
lash adhesive from duo and those are
$5.99 I really need to pick one up my
clear is almost gone and on days where I
don't wear a liner I like to use the
clear because it does dry clear days
that I wear a liner I use my duo dark
adhesive because it blends in with the
black liner easier but I'm almost
I do want to repurchase that then I went
over to the Milani website and I was
kind of looking around I couldn't decide
what all from Milani was catching my
attention but the only thing I ended up
putting on my list was their new bold is
it called bold obsessions eyeshadow
palette I just wrote down bold but their
new eyeshadow palette I talked about
this one in a while I buy it fairly
recently and I've been seeing more
people using them in videos again it's
$20 for an eyeshadow palette which is a
little bit pricier especially I thought
for Milani but if I have a gift card I
would like to be able to turn those out
because I've been seen where people use
them went back to the Ulta website I
picked out the lash princesa mascara
from essence right essence lash princess
mascara which is $4.99 I hear everybody
raving about this everybody says it's
fantastic I have yet to try it out so I
would love to be able to try it out and
then I went over to the morphe website
and once again just like what I did with
color pop I tried to be very realistic
with myself and if I actually do have a
gift card what is it that I'm putting in
my car I only picked out one thing from
the morphe website I feel like I'm
pretty good with brushes I felt like I
was really good with morphe eyeshadow
palettes and there just wasn't too much
else that was catching my attention but
I have always wanted to try there
setting spray which is $15
I hear amazing things about the setting
spray about mist on it about how it just
absolutely locks on the makeup so if I'm
picking out something from the morphe
website I'm picking out the setting
spray for sure already so how many items
did we add to the list 3 6 7 8 9 so we
added 10 more items to the list so I
think we're now up to 16 items and we're
still at only 175 dollars and 85 cents
which means I still got some more money
to spend so my last little list here I
went back to the other website and I
picked out a flower beauty blush and
this one is in I can't read my
handwriting to save my life I just need
to take notes on my phone because my
handwriting is the worst it looks like
it says something about Primrose peach
Primrose maybe is what my handwriting is
telling me it's 999 but I hear really
good things about the flower Beauty
blushes and again I kind of went back to
once I picked everything out that I
really wanted I went back to like what
are a few things that I could add on
here as well and because
wanted to try more flour booty I went
back and added a blush I also did look
up the cody airspun powder I found it at
a couple different places it's not
available at Ulta but I found it at a
Walgreens website and then also the
Walmart website I believe it was and
it's 729 I hear really good things about
the Cody airspun powder a lot of people
say it's like one of their favorite
affordable like setting powders I
thought I could give that one a try and
then the last item that I was going to
put on my list is the ultimen sealer and
this one is nine dollars but I've been
hearing a lot of really good things
about the ultimate concealer as well and
when I did I think it was my a throned
makeup products video I was talking
about concealers in there and I had a
couple people write in and say have I
tried the Ulta one yet it's supposed to
be really good so I decided I would put
that one on my list and that is nine
dollars and of course since I was doing
Ulta more for you color pop Milani
Walmart I feel like there would be a lot
of different shipping for all of those
Ulta would probably be free but
everything else I wasn't quite 100% on I
didn't do things like discount codes or
things like that I just was going off of
the subtotals and with all of those
products in there I think we had maybe
19 I think it was in total for the
drugstore affordable side and we came to
202 dollars and 13 cents so I went over
my $200 at both locations but I still
was under on the affordable side a
Sephora was a 202 dollars and 50 cents
affordable was 202 dollars and 13 cents
which I just thought was very intriguing
but those are my list those are if I had
$200 to spend at both high-end makeup
location and also an affordable those
are the items that I would choose and
that is how I went shopping I guess if I
was gonna do it for today's video and
doing a some imaginary shopping with my
two hundred dollar gift card purchasing
high-end makeup and also purchasing a
drugstore affordable makeup I love to
know you guys a thought of this video

be a link down below and is where I got
