is going to be a new declutter video and
I'm going to be looking at my highlight
collection oh this feels so cruel I love
my highlights I'm really sad to be
getting rid of a few I don't know how
well I'm gonna do just looking over
everything right now not sure how well
I'm gonna do decluttering but I've been
trying to work on my collection and get
them too cluttered so that is what we
are going to be working on today so if
you'd like to see a new declutter video
and see which highlights make the cut
and which ones I decide to declutter why
don't we go ahead and get started
I tried not to pull out my face palettes
because I will do a face palette
declutter as well but I pulled out two
palettes that like our majority
highlights and you know that maybe have
like one blush or something in a but for
the most part they are like a highlight
palette so just going to kind of grab
maybe from the top and work my way from
there so this one is a highlight from
Burberry I just got this one I haven't
used it yet I just asked the question
the other day if you would like to see a
full face using high-end makeup from me
and I think I'm going to film that video
in the next couple weeks here and this
is actually the highlight that I am
planning on using so I'm going to be
keeping this one and we'll be testing it
out together on camera so next up I have
the palette here from Becca cosmetics
and collaboration with Chrissy Teigen
this was sent to me from a subscriber
friend which I was so excited about
because I was a little bit on the fence
about getting this because I wasn't sure
if the colors would look like great on
me cuz I thought maybe it would be
better for a little bit of a darker skin
tone than myself but I was excited to
get it to be able to try it out and at
first I was like yes this is fantastic
like I have to go pretty light handed on
the bronzer and the blush because they
are pretty dark on me but as long as I
go light hand it it didn't seem too bad
but I the highlights don't look great on
me especially this one right here it's
almost like it's just too pigment it
because when I put it on it almost looks
like I am putting a blush with a lot of
shimmer on and it can sometimes actually
disrupt my makeup so I haven't been
reaching for this palette and this one
almost does the same thing though this
highlight
only shows more there's been a couple
times where I've actually had to go in
and kind of like wipe off my face makeup
and start again because the hut it's
just it's very strange I don't know if
I've ever come across a highlight that
way so I actually think that I should
declutter this one that's really hard to
do and I don't like decluttering items
that I get sent to me from friends and
subscribers to review because I
appreciate it so much I really do but I
feel like I could pass this on to
someone who would enjoy it even more
than I would and it would like all the
shades would look great on them I think
that I should do it it's a really nice
palette it's really nice quality really
nice shades but I think it will suit
someone better than it does me so next
up I have another face palette from
Becca cosmetics this was in
collaboration with Jaclyn hill this one
does have three blushes in here but I
pulled it out because really I feel like
the stars of this palette are these two
highlights right here champ champagne
pop and then Prosecco pop this is one of
my absolute like Holy Grail must-haves
favorite palettes ever of life I mean so
I'm gonna declutter it I'm just like I'm
just like I'm definitely keeping this
one this is this is like a staple of
mine for sure so next up I have this
highlight here from Kevin a Quan I got
this sent to me from octa Lee I'm sorry
I know I haven't been spotting oh my
gosh this highlight is so soft I forget
how soft it is I know I'm never the best
at remembering to swatch okay so there's
what that Kevin a Kwan highlight looks
like this one is in the like full name
for it is the Neill highlighter in
Sahara I did get this sent to me from
actively to review and really really do
like it I feel like I don't reach for it
as much but I think that needs to change
because I remember when I first was
trying it I was like oh my gosh yes and
I love the Kevin of kuan highlighters I
have a couple and a face palette as well
I'm gonna hang on to this one I'm going
to so next up I have this Lancome
highlighter it's one of their dual dual
finished highlighters in a sparkling
peach and oh my gosh this highlight is
gorgeous I just mentioned look that like
come on just mentioned this I don't know
if the video is up yet some kind of
filming all over the place but this is a
favorite for the month of September that
will be featured in my makeup monthly it
is freaking stunning
I'm obsessed with it I'm wearing it so
much I think it's absolutely beautiful
absolutely beautiful
I'm totally keeping this one I'm very
impressed with it next up I have this
highlight from Burberry it is the rose
gold fresh glow highlighter this was
sent to me from Burberry as well so
there's what it looks like I mean look
at that huh I will say it takes just a
little bit to build it up like you don't
quite get that full like when you just
do like the one swipe if you come in
like two times and just build it up a
little bit it is so freaking a pretty I
have to keep this one I mean hello I
have to keep it I just wore it the other
day too and it's it looks really really
good on the skin I really enjoyed this
one so next up I actually just got this
highlight in the mail this is from make
up your mind cosmetics and this is what
the highlight looks like I haven't even
touched it yet I legitimately just got
it this is called fame and fortune I
believe this as an Etsy shop so I will
have it linked in my description box but
let's go ahead and swatch it for the
first time together this just came whole
my goodness holy buckets that is Wow
okay I don't feel like I have any sort
of highlight in that shade like it has a
really it's on it's like a yellow gold I
don't feel like I really have anything
like this so oh I'm excited this was
sent to me from make up your mind
cosmetics so big thank you to them for
sending this to me and that was pretty
impressive so that one is fame and
fortune so I'm definitely to keep this
one because I do want to review it this
next one I have is from Jake at beauty
it's the you glow girl based highlighter
in the shade Bella Rose this one is so
cool I believe I have mentioned this in
a past favorites section in my makeup
monthly video you can find look at that
I always forget how pigmented this one
is - it is so beautiful you can find
Jake at Beauty at Ulta mmm that is so
pretty it has like a really cool like
purple iridescent to it I just think it
is so so lovely and I love the flower
it's so pretty definitely one of my
favorites got to keep this one so this
is a highlight from makeup revolution
and let's see this is called their
shimmer brick radiance I just had this
one out the other day and you say I
think it's so pretty so you can either
you know if you just want one color or
if you want to mix a couple together or
if you want to kind of swish it all
together I usually do like that when I'm
gonna do my highlight and I like the
color that that gives me so I typically
go into those first three rows but you
can kind of like I like this highlighter
because I feel like you know you can
kind of play around or do whatever you
you want to do whatever highlight you
want to come out with but that's
typically what I do when I reach in for
this one you can find makeup revolution
altos well they're very affordable and
yeah I really I really enjoyed this one
this one gets pulled out quite a bit
keeping this one oh so far we're doing
terribly just as I thought I was gonna
do I liked it leather but next up I have
tickets here from Anastasi Beverly Hills
the first one is the that glow palette
this was the first glow kit that I got
from Anastasia Beverly Hills you can see
I've put my fingernails into him a
handful of times so we have this one and
then I also have the sweets glow kit if
you guys do not know I have a really bad
luck with the glow kits after getting
that glow all of them have come to me
shattered I recently declared my Nicole
Guerrero glow kit that had a shattered
one end there I ended up getting the
sweets glow kit like four different ones
in the mail they were all shattered like
I just have really terrible luck with
these cloak ins for some reason so when
I open it like everyone's gonna gasp in
horror because eventually Anastasio is
like we can't even send you anymore
they're sold out whatever I look okay
and so everyone was saying to do that
the thing was is it like alcohol that
you pour in here and you do like try to
repress it yeah so this is what Michael
Oh Kate now looks like and I just I just
like hate it I get mad every time I open
it because I actually really liked some
of these shades in here and I'm just
like frustrated that I don't know I feel
like they look different I feel like
they feel different like not only they
look different in the pan I feel like
they look different on my face they feel
different I'm just like every time I
open it I'm just mad so I barely ever
reach for this even though I liked this
glow kit even more than the back glow so
I'm just going to declutter this one
like because I'm just frustrated with it
and I never retort anymore because I'm
so bad at it and then I'm actually going
to declare this one even though I like
it and it's in really good shape oh I
guess I could put this one in my blog
sale um yeah yeah yeah I am running a
blog sale I'll have it linked down below
any of these highlights that I declutter
which I'm doing a terrible job of so far
but any that I declutter that I
purchased for myself I will have up for
sale in my blog sale in case anyone is
interested so I can actually put this
one in my blog sale it is like so
lightly used the shade that I use the
most is bubbly that was definitely my
favorite but what I think I actually
want is that new I'm sassy a glow cat
that's coming out I know it has a couple
shades from the Suites one in there and
I think it has starburst which I don't
think the glow kid that starburst was
originally in is available anymore so I
think I won't feel so bad if I do
clutter to glow kits and then get that
new one it wouldn't make me feel as bad
so I think I'm gonna go ahead and get
rid of both of these this one because
I'm just always mad at this one because
I barely reach for and I'm typically
only going for that one shade so that
was kind of a bummer but I'll go ahead
and put this one in my blog sale I mean
this one is just a disaster I can't
imagine anyone would want that one but
yeah I'm gonna go ahead and declutter
both of these whoa that makes me feel a
little bit better at least if I have
this palette from Smashbox this is the
one in collaboration with Casey Holmes
this is the spotlight palette and pearl
love this palette I'm obsessed with it I
reach for it so much they recommend this
one I know it's still available and
everything I have mine in pearl like I
said and I love it definitely sticking
around so next up I did put this one in
here this is from lorac cosmetics in
collaboration with pirates in the
Caribbean the collection that they came
out with it is considered a face palette
but it's mostly highlights like this one
I use as a blush the shade I don't
really use but it's kind of like a blush
but the other four are highlights so I
did include it in here since majority or
highlights this palette is awesome I
have recommended this so much I know the
parts of the Caribbean collection is
limited edition but if you can find this
anymore
I think some people said they saw it at
Kohl's maybe if you can find it I would
definitely get it these highlights are
freaking awesome I love the big mirror
in here - yeah
one is so good definitely keeping this
one well I have a couple here from Marc
Jacobs I believe this one was sent to me
in an influencer box and I did purchase
this one I think it was in the most
recent vib sale I really like these
though I really like Marc Jacobs as a
brand there is not much that I have
tried from that brand that I dislike
it's more of a cream highlight this is
what it looks like I typically don't
wear this alone so pretty I don't wear
it alone but I love to layer it over a
highlight that maybe you know I want a
certain highlight but it doesn't give
off the greatest boom
I will just put this one on first and
it's such a good amplifier it is pretty
by itself and especially in the summer
it looks good for just like none of you
not a natural glow it's not natural but
for me it's a little bit more like the
natural side from what I normally do so
I do want to keep this one I really
enjoy it and then the dew drops this was
actually a purchase that I was like
there's no way I'm gonna like this I'm
totally buying into the hype it has a
pump and like there's just no way that
this one is going to be any good
yeah no it's it's actually fantastic
like look at that tiny little drop I did
I already know that's way too much but
just a look I kind of look at how
beautiful that is it is so so oh so
pretty I love these highlights they're
so good they both have to stick around
I'm sorry but you know I just oh I think
they're great okay so I have some little
guys here so let's talk about these so
this one is from Becca cosmetics and
this is an opal their highlight and opal
this was the very first Becca highlight
that I tried I got a little sample size
to see if I loved it and unfortunately
it did shatter so I know whenever I talk
about my highlights shattering people
are like oh just repress them well you
saw what my Glock it looked like so no
clearly I can't do that I don't have the
skill for that so while I'm super bummed
about this you know I have my other
Becca highlights and obviously I'm
keeping a ton of highlights so I mean I
can go ahead and you know get rid of
this little guy and you know it'll be
fine so I am gonna declutter this one
because it's broken and I just don't
I don't even want to try messing around
with fixing it and this is a highlight
from artist Couture is the company I
believe started by Mac Daddy
this is an Illuminati I got this in one
of my beauty box is my beauty con box I
believe it was and it's really gorgeous
it's kind of more of like that pigment
highlight but look I got it is really so
stunning I don't really want to put my
finger in it just watch it because it's
gonna make a huge mess that's the only
thing I don't like about this highlight
is that it is super super messy but it
is like a blinding blinding highlight I
know these highlights have very good
reputation for being poppin and I would
totally agree with that so I'm keeping
this one keeping that one okay moving on
I have this one from elf cosmetics this
was sent to me from ELF and it is a
liquid highlight and it kind of
frustrates me because it has nothing on
it it just all it says is elf so I don't
know if it has a certain name or shade
name or what and I actually swatched it
once against the Marc Jacobs because I
thought maybe it was a dupe it's
definitely not a dupe when you you know
start to blend it out it actually ends
up pretty sheer whereas you saw that
Marc Jacobs won it was like BAM the
reason why I was kind of keeping it in
my collection because I thought I could
put it in a dupes video but it's not and
it's just not enough I mean I have that
you know all over my hand here and I
feel like you can barely even see a
sheen it's a little too natural for me
for what I prefer with my highlights so
I think I will go ahead and put this in
the declutter pile next up I have these
two these are two of my newest
highlighters so I do want to keep them
because I'm still reviewing them this
one I just tried for the first time the
other day it's featured in my trying new
drugstore makeup so I've only put this
on one time this is the Maybelline
master chrome in molten gold it is
really beautiful in the video I just had
to build it up just a little bit but
it's a pretty you know intense gold
metallic highlight so you want to keep
that one and I picked this up during the
Aldo 21 days of beauty I believe it was
this was half off this is from Oprah and
this is in blissful really really a
gorgeous highlight I saw Amanda and
Singh recommending this one because I
almost got Rodeo Drive
and I ended up going with blissful and
I'm not mad about it I think it's
gorgeous so this is also very much new
to me so I'm going to keep that one
except I have this highlight this is
from essence the pure nude highlight oh
my goodness this is gorgeous and when I
got this I was like oh you know it looks
pretty I don't know natural standard
maybe not like a blingy blingy highlight
and they're just watched watch again
right here I was like mmm I don't know
it is so so beautiful there's a swatch
of it there I remember when I went to
Colorado I took this with me because I
just thought it was a really nice
everyday highlight because it's not like
the metallic and it's you know not my
most belonging highlight but it's also
not super natural on me it's kind of a
really nice in-between and I just love
it it's super soft it's very pretty
essence is very affordable so if you're
looking for a good affordable
highlighter that you know you're not
gonna be seen from Mars if that's not
your thing I would check out this one
from essence it's so good so I do want
to keep this one Oh alrighty so these
are the last ones that I have left so
the Sun is a from milk makeup this is
their highlighting stick in Mars I
really enjoy milk makeup I love their
packaging it's so cool I feel like you
can even see on camera that like pink
iridescent I think it is super fun so
let's see if I can get a swatch for you
can you see that shift there I feel like
I don't have a lot like this like having
this highlight to have around as an
option I just think it's really really
neat so I want to keep this one - doing
well doing well okay so I have to hear
from pixie these are both in
collaboration with Aspen Oh bard
and I do have some pixie face palettes
as well that have highlights so at first
I was like I'm going to keep both of
these but really in the spirit of
decluttering I feel like I should get
rid of one but I don't know which one so
this one is in santorini sunset I know I
just used this one the other day and I
thought it was so pretty oh how am I
gonna choose that one has more of a gold
shift to it and then this other one is
in London
luster I think this one was the one that
was kind of more of a pearl yeah more of
a pearl highlight so there is that
one I know that I reached for that one
more and just watching them I feel like
I feel like I just like this one better
so I'm gonna go ahead and keep santorini
sunset and then i will put what was this
one london luster i'll put that one in
the declutter pile final two so this one
is from the bomb this would be mary
loumanizer
this is my very first highlight oh here
she is
i purchased this off amazon randomly
enough and i was super excited about it
cuz it was my first highlight and i felt
like I was doing big things and really I
mean it's a really gorgeous highlight
still whoo there it is this was not a
bad first highlight purchase at all
there she is
I do want to keep this one and not only
do I really enjoy it I don't have a lot
from the bomb so I would like to be able
to keep this one around this is my first
highlight like not only is it still
beautiful and great but you know
nostalgia definitely keeping that one
and then this last one here is from
Becca cosmetics and this is the
champagne pop in collaboration with
Jaclyn hill unfortunately mine if I can
open it correctly oh my god - shattered
I dropped it and I dropped it on the
carpet I truly did not think I can
remember the day I dropped it and I was
like oh no I'd be fine I just dropped it
on carpet and it wasn't even that far
and I opened it and I was like well I
may but I do have the champagne pop in
that back a face palette that I showed I
don't I'm not interested in like trying
to repress it cuz I know I would just
ruin it
so I'm just gonna go ahead and declutter
this one so hey we're ending on a
declutter that's not too bad because I
definitely kept more than I declutter
but I figured that all right so final
count I decluttered seven items and then
I kept I think it's nineteen really
enjoying highlights and I didn't feel
like I had you know a huge massive
collection to begin with I had put
myself in a highlight no by quite a few
months ago and I was doing pretty good
on that as I said I was on my highlight
nobody I've realized I had another one
this is from wet and wild and precious
petals this is what broke my highlight
no bye it was like $4 at Ulta and it was
in
clutches so I had to go run and grab it
was one of my newest ones I haven't even
like technically reviewed it yet so I'm
gonna keep that one too but I had been
on a highlight no bye and I felt like I
was doing a pretty good job so I know I
only declutter a few items but I feel
like I did better than I even thought
that I was going to so I guess that's a
good thing but yeah that was my
highlight declutter here I think next up
I'm gonna do a foundation declutter and
then eyeshadow palette and then I think
maybe like mascaras and I and eyeliners
maybe if I can do them together but
that's gonna be coming up for my
declutter series I don't have much from
this round to add into my blog sale but
I will go ahead and I'll put anything
that I can up into that blog sale if
anyone is interested in buying anything
there are a couple other items to
purchase up there right now as well so I
will have that linked down below but I
hope you guys enjoyed seeing my
highlighter collection and that some of
the items that I decluttered and let me
know if you are still liking the
declutter videos because like I said I
have a few more that I can be doing for
my collection as well and if you guys
