today's video is going to be a haul a
follow-up and review video so I recently
did a collective haul and I had my first
Beauty lish order in there so I have a
couple items to review from that haul
and then most recently I did a big
Sephora and Ulta haul so I've been
trying everything out so I can come back
and give my review so if you are
interested to my thoughts on some of
these products let me go ahead and get
started already so first up I want to go
over at the items that I placed with
Beauty Alysha since that was the longer
ago so I'll have that video link down
below in case you're interested but it
was my first Beauty lush order I was so
excited to order from Beauty lash great
things about Beauty life I had a great
experience it shipped right away
everything was like bubble wrapped and
packed really well highly impressed with
beauty lush both definitely order from
them again
but I picked up this item here from a
way this is the first product I've
purchased from Jo a cosmetics and I was
excited for that this is the blush book
or the blush duo --kx gives me the
Coquette blush duo
so I love the packaging on it and then
you have two big blushes in here you
have a nice mirror and this I am so
impressed to it and blush is one of
those things like I don't get super
worked up over blushes necessarily but I
keep reaching for this guy over and over
and over again and I think both blushes
are really beautiful I really love to
mix the blushes great packaging on it
love the mirror it is $30 so she's the
pricy little guy but I'm very impressed
with this I'm very glad that I purchased
it so mu then I also purchased some
items from Charlotte Tilbury there'd
been a couple things that I was eyeing
from the brand Charlotte Tilbury is more
expensive but I was like you know what
I'm doing it so I purchased her airbrush
a flawless finish a skin perfecting
micro powder I got mine in the shade 2
which is medium it is fairly light
though I mean I'm gonna say it is fairly
light I do have my lights on because I
just really really dark outside right
now real dark outside and it's 2 o'clock
but this one I got in medium so you have
the compact here you do have a mirror
and then you have a powder
I see everybody raving about this powder
everybody loves it and people use it to
set their whole face they use it to set
their
and I'm like I need to have this powder
I've recently gotten back into a setting
my foundation with a setting powder I
stopped doing that for the longest time
and all of a sudden within like past two
months is like a step that I very rarely
missed this is a $45 powder so very very
pricey and honestly I like it but I
don't love it and I don't think that I
would repurchase it unless there was
like a crazy sale going on or something
because it didn't blow my socks off like
I expected it to what how much people
rave and like just totally talked up
this product I still think it's nice I
just don't think it makes the skin look
nice but honestly this to me is like
super comparable to my covergirl their
new healthy vitalist powder that came
out I think it's what it's called
I've given that one rave reviews rave
reviews I'm just really like I don't
know if I can quite see a difference
between the two I mean it makes my skin
look very nice it's really smooth it's
not too cakey at all but again so does
the covergirl and I've actually been
finding myself reaching for the
covergirl more and not reaching for this
one as much like I'll still use it
I don't think it's a bad powder but for
$45 I think I was just expecting to just
be like have you guys seen this pattern
on my face and I'm just like not so yeah
this one I was kind of like - I was so
on but then the next one is not good
it's not good I kind of made reference
to this if you watched my lip pick
series I talked about this one in my
mela pics video because one day I tried
tried to wear this lipstick from
Charlotte Tilbury it's one of the it's a
conflict the have lips there's something
like that I think I double-checked yes
it is the Hot Lips lipstick and this is
in the shade Kim kW I've heard a lot of
people say really good things about
these lipsticks say really good things
about Kim kW just being like a great
nude and a perfect nude and I was like
yes I'm gonna get you and it's gonna be
fabulous so it's definitely more of like
a pinky nude sorry I know my legs are
really bright but I just want you to be
able to see me today
so it's more of like a really really
light pink and it has a sheen to it but
when I put this on my lips it doesn't it
doesn't stick to my lips like I don't
know how to describe it I know a couple
of you guys also said in my lip pics
video when I mentioned this you said the
same thing happened with this particular
shade you said you had other colors and
the Hot Lips and they didn't do it as
much so I don't know what it is about
this one but when I put it on especially
like right in the center of my lips
literally it doesn't matter how many
times I swipe the lipstick over it it is
not staying on my lips so the first time
that I went to wear it I was like I
can't even like no I look terrible
so I tried to put a gloss over it to
just kind of like save it but
unfortunately I can't wear this and I
was a $34 a little sick okay
$34 and I don't feel like it so but it
sucks um I don't know what bootylicious
return policy is but like I was so
excited my god everything I just threw
it like I threw the box away
I think the receipt away I was just like
I love makeup this is gonna be great am
i great you did that so that's a bummer
I'm so follow Lucy those on the flash
mark someday since it does a regular
lipstick and I can sanitize it but this
unfortunately that hurt touching over to
my latest Ulta and Sephora haul so one
thing that I picked up from Ulta this is
from batiste it is the dry shampoo the
clean and classic original they were
having a sale one day they're having
like their gorgeous hair event and this
was like $4 for the full size and I was
like I'm just gonna go ahead and get it
honestly I've only used it twice
so I can't really say a whole lot yeah I
mean I don't know I feel like two times
it's fine enough for a dry shampoo I
just used it the other day as well it
really is it says an instant hair
refresh I feel like that's really true
like it just kind of give you an instant
like boom to my hair like I quite liked
it and I feel like it did suck up the
oils right away
a lot of people say with this one they
notice like a white cast with it and I
didn't I do have lighter hair Ramone I
mean girl ones listening to get it done
I do have lighter hair but I didn't
notice anything like that and I like
this one I felt like I like a scent I
like the way that my hair still felt
afterwards it didn't feel like
- icky or anything so I like this I'll
definitely keep using it and for $4 to
have a big ol thing of dark shampoo I'm
not mad
okay and then moving on I picked up the
morphe continuous a setting mist so
everybody raves about this they say it's
so great it has like uh well it's the
continuous segment so it has a
continuous spray so you can just spray
it no I go to waste that would be silly
so I was excited to get this it finally
came in all that it had only been
available in the morphe site for the
longest time is $15 so it's not the most
like most expensive studying spray or
anything like that it's also not the
cheapest but it is really good I do like
that continuous mist on it I don't know
what it is about like not having to like
Shh my face that I like so much but I
really do like that and I do feel like
it's keeping my makeup in place it's the
one is L'Oreal The True Match Lumi
foundation I love this foundation this
was a repurchase for me I continue to
love the foundation I mentioned it in my
top favorite summer foundations quite
enjoy it the shade I got I felt like
matched me really well I got n4 which is
buff beige so yes very very impressed
with this one still enjoy it it's like
$12 and it's my favorite drugstore
foundation and then I also picked up
this little mini guide this is from
Laura Geller it has the gilded honey
highlighter
she's so cute I'll go ahead and do a
swatch here - I got this for $12 I
mentioned just getting a mini would be
totally fine for me you can see it with
the light it's so beautiful I mentioned
a mini would be fine for me because I've
never gone through a highlight or hit
pan on a highlight so I got the mini for
$12 and this is really beautiful it's a
really nice gold but not too gold of a
highlight I was just wearing again the
other day and I think I'm gonna get so
many uses out of it I'm gonna be so
excited if I hit pan on this I feel like
I could see it actually happening but
I've really been enjoying this one I
think it's a really smooth highlight I
didn't think it should have too much
texture it doesn't have glitter in it
it's just a nice gold highlight for the
cheeks and I think especially in the
warmer weather we're more tan I think
I'm really gonna get on with this line
so very happy with this so next up I
have been so impressed so impressed with
this next product this is from Ulta
beauty from there
line it is the full-coverage liquid
concealer it says it's waterproof
this guy is nine dollars and it is so
good so good I'm so impressed it is it's
very full coverage it covers everything
but it blends right out it's not too
thick I usually like to do it since it
is more full coverage I kind of apply
the concealer on my under eye here and
then I blend it out and set it and then
I come in and do the other eye it dries
a little quicker so that's why I like to
do it but it's nothing like
instantaneous like I'm applying it while
trying to blend it in type of thing but
I've been really impressed with this I
haven't got a lot of creasing with it
it's holding up really well I think this
is going to be a really good concealer
especially for the summertime and having
no problems with the longevity of it
super and price very excited about this
one I got the shade light neutral in
case you're curious again nine dollars
for a concealer this is a good one
pretty excited about that alright so I
also picked up from Urban Decay their
new all nighter waterproof setting
powder
this guy is $34 so again you have the
compact here with the mirror and then
the powder inside it is a translucent
powder it's supposed to be able to set
your makeup make any foundation
waterproof and it's also supposed to be
mattifying and so when I thought of that
first summer I was like well that sounds
perfect for the warm months here sounds
great again I have been so impressed
with this I actually mentioned it in my
summer essentials video and that even
was like you know what I've only used it
a couple times but that's just how
impressed I am with it I wanted to
mention it already but of course I'll be
reviewing it so here's my review and I'm
still just as impressed with this this
is one when I put it on I see those
instant results I Pat it onto my face
and boom like I am Matt I feel like it
makes my poor smaller even the first
time I was applying it I was doing it
for an Instagram tutorial and so I could
see my face on the camera
I literally applied it and went and like
started looking at my skin really close
up I just filmed before this for the
colour-pop video and I probably went off
the day before so I'm like how is my
foundation holding up actually it's been
about three hours since
film that colour-pop video so here's a
little check-in if you want to see what
I'm looking like everything seems to be
holding up pretty well foundation still
looks good concealer still looks okay I
shadow
looking good highlight still looking
good so if you haven't seen that video
I'll leave it linked down below but it
really was one that I saw instant
results with I feel like the mattifying
effect to it and I've been finding
myself putting this one in my clutch a
lot along with the Maybelline that just
always stays in there because when
there's nights that we go out and since
especially it's so warm I'm getting kind
of do at the end of the night boom this
is just gonna make you look make you
look not so shiny once again and I'm
really really impressed with this I
don't know yet what I feel about like
the waterproof like how waterproof it's
making my foundations because I don't
know if I've ever like run into that
problem but I feel like it's really
working I feel like it's doing something
I really like this I mean if I were to
recommend this are the Charlotte Tilbury
there are two different powders like and
like they do two different things but
honestly it would be the urban decay and
it's cheaper so a few items left to go
so I also purchased one of the Anastasi
Beverly Hills blush
trios and this one is in pool party they
went on sale from like $30 to $21 or
something like that I think it was so I
decided to pick a pool party honestly I
like this but if I were to say should
you get this or at the jus a Coquette
blush book or they have a couple
different blush books I think three of
them and I think Anasazi is like five or
so of these different blush trios I
would recommend the Coquette I feel like
they are the shoe way I feel like they
apply easier and I feel like they last a
really long time I don't mind the
anastacio and I feel like they've been
working well for me but I don't feel
like it's a super long-lasting blush and
I'm just more impressed with the G way
I've mostly been going for this more of
like a nude blush but I also really like
this one this one here in the middle is
a little bit too of like a hot pink the
sparkles don't really because they're
shimmer in it I don't really notice that
a ton when I put it onto my cheeks but
it's still just too much of like a
brighter pink or I can mix these two
together and that color I don't mind I
do that the first day I put this
I was like too much so I put this on to
tone it down and it helped a little bit
so I like these two out of here I'm glad
that I got this on sale you know it's a
nice compact and it's a nice mirror I'm
glad that I got it on sale but I don't
think it's gonna be like my most reach
for blush trio if that makes sense and
then I also picked up a new palette -
from Hoonah beauty this is the coral
obsessions palette
I love the obsessions palette from who -
beauty this is now like my fourth one so
you have a mirror inside and then you
have nine different shades
these are twenty seven dollars I really
enjoyed these palettes once again I
enjoyed this one so much I've been
having a really good time with this
palette because I feel like there's so
many different things I could do I've
done an all yellow look I've done a look
with this kind of like dual chrome coral
like it kind of reminds me of the color
of my shirt right now I don't
I did a look with that but I thought was
so pretty so you can do something really
simple with the shades in here and then
I feel like you can also amp it up so
I've been having a great time playing
with this palette I feel like it's the
same as all the other palettes and I
really like this one so if you're
thinking about getting this one I would
still say get it if you guys want to see
a comparison video with this in the
color pop it yes please let me know
because I know a few people have been
asking me about that and how similar
they are and if you have the yes please
do you need this one so if you guys
would want to see a video on that do let
me know because I would be happy to make
that but I'm really happy with that one
they also picked up the natasha de Nona
blush &amp;amp; Glo mini so this is a duo you
have a blush inside and also a highlight
and they're just a smaller size a
smaller compact you do still get a
mirror and I said when I was when I was
hauling it I was like these aren't AB
small as I thought that they were going
to be the way people were talking about
it I literally accept it like this much
product I can get my brush into both of
these fine I really don't have any
issues with the sizing on them I will
say that the blush doesn't do much for
me it doesn't totally blow me away it
shows up and it's a nice leg it's a nice
wash of color onto my cheeks but it's
not if you like if you really like blush
and you really like it to be very
noticeable that you have a lot of blush
on this would not be it for you but if
you do respond like a a wash of color
onto the cheeks I don't mind it but
not my favorite I do like the highlight
out of here though I think that's a
really nice highlight again it's not
like too overpowering but it's not super
subtle on me either and I also have been
putting this one in like my inner corner
for the highlight a lot and I think that
looks nice so I'm not I'm not totally
blown away on this one I didn't consider
returning it though because I think I'll
I think there will be those occasions
that I want to reach for something but
not quite as binding and I I don't mind
paying the 19 dollars for it so I'm okay
with this one it just didn't it didn't
tighten me up I feel like with Natasha
to Nonna I've tried her mini sunset
palette and then I've tried this mini
blush and glow now and I'm glad that
I've gotten both minis because I like
both products but they are not
convincing me to spend full price
on the full-size products you know it's
it's not convincing me to do that so
that's kind of what I think about it so
up I just keep going the mini route
wouldn't atashi you Nonna and save some
save some of my coin okay the last one I
have to talk about I'm pretty excited
talk about this one - this is from milk
makeup it's the cushion mascara so this
was it was either a 100-point perk or
the bonus offer I think it was like the
Beauty offer where you entered the code
and so I got a mini guy to try out I
actually really like this mascara I do
have it on my lashes today and I can
tell I've been using it so much I feel
like I'm nearing the end of my tube and
I am probably gonna purchase the full
sizes so that's how much it impressed me
so way to go milk makeup it makes the
lashes really long really like there's a
thickness to them that I can tell this
there it holds up really well the only
only thing that I will say is that I can
start to get the slightest bit of
transfer on my under eyes and I felt
like I actually noticed that earlier
when I was looking close up yeah there's
just the smallest bit and so far it's
only on this eye it takes a little bit
of time and I feel like I need to be
like if I was just sitting around it's
not really happening but like I took
areas for a walk so we were outside and
all of that and so I feel like when that
happens I can start to get the slightest
bit of transfer it's not too much it's
not too overwhelming but it is something
that I noticed and that's like really
the only downfall that I found
with this mascara so just something to
keep in mind but other than that I
really like the way it's making my
lashes look and you know I wear false
lashes a lot but there's been so many
days where I'm like I'll skip them and
I'm like I'm gonna put the build makeup
mascara on because I really like what
it's doing for my lashes so I am pretty
impressed with this one but after that
that is going to do it for my haul
review video ok so that is everything
for today's video reviewing some of the
products that I got from Beauty lush
also and also Sephora I'll have
everything that I mentioned down below
in case you're interested in anything
I'd love to know if you've tried any of
these products have you had the same
experience as me let us know in the
comments down below but other than that
if you guys did enjoy this video I hope
that you'll give it a thumbs up I hope
that you'll also consider subscribing
