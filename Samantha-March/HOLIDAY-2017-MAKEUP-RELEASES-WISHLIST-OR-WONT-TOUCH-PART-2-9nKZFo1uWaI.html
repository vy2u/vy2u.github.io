today's video is going to be a part two
to in my makeup releases a wish list
versus a won't a touch of video I will
have my part 1 video it will list it
down below in case you missed that one
and you want to catch up and see what
holiday releases I talked about in that
video basically I'm going to be going
through I think I have 7 different
holiday releases here I'm gonna be
letting you know a little bit about them
and then if I'll be adding them to my
wishlist or if I am NOT interested and
will not be touching them so if you are
ready to get started why don't we go
ahead and jump into it so the first one
is actually the newest one to me and
someone actually just tagged me on
Twitter at the night before because it
is a new release of from Make Up For
Ever as I knew on my shadow palette it's
called the lustrous shadow palette it's
going to be limited edition most holiday
releases are going to be a limited
edition it says it has a new eyeshadow
formula it's 12 mat and metallic shades
and it's going to be $49 I thought it
was interesting because when I got
tagged on Twitter she said this looks
like the Weiser palette that you are
interested in I just talked about the
Weiser golden hour eyes shadow palette
in last week's Villa diet video and this
definitely does look incredibly similar
to it that one is nine shades for $49
this one is twelve shades for $49 so
same price you're just getting three
extra shadows with this makeup forever
one this palette looks really cool it's
palette looks really cool I mean of
course because the shades are so similar
to that buys art one I was immediately
attracted to it these are the shades and
I'm super interested in these are the
shades that I love so I'm I am this one
really hard I don't have a release date
on it yet it just says that it's coming
soon so I'm not a hundred percent when
it will be launching but I will be
keeping an eye out for it because it's
definitely going on my wish list same
thing with the visor palette I mentioned
in that video I already put it on my
love's list I will be putting this on my
love's list so these are a little bit
different from the would I buy it videos
because I'm not necessarily that I'm
going out and purchasing it but I'm
putting it on my wish list I know that I
do want it per head aside if I had to
choose between visor and makeup forever
that's a really hard decision they're
both on my love's list they're both on
my wish list but definitely this makeup
forever one caught my attention right
away it's going on my wish list quite
advantage tags on this set from Marc
Jacobs Beauty oh man this is
called the snake charmer 5-piece petit
enamoured hi jean gloss lacquer
collection so the high shine glasses I
own sugar sugar I went out and purchased
the full-size I also received a deluxe
eye sample in one of the Sephora give me
a some nude lip collection that they
have so you are getting a five of the
glosses the shades are in two changes
sugar sugar skin deep raspberry beret
and boys don't cry so you're getting a
five of the minis for $39 I believe for
one regular sized lip gloss I think it
is $28 I want to say I did purchase them
myself so it is expensive for one of
those so when I saw $39 I understand
that they're minis but I have owned a
mini for quite some time it is always in
my clutch with me I wear that lip gloss
a lot and I don't feel like I've put a
dent in it so I think that is a
fantastic price is it gonna go on my
wish list no because I have sugar sugar
not only one but I have two sugar sugars
I wouldn't need it one of the things
that I do enjoy the most about the
holiday sets that come out as a lot of
times you can get you know some of these
minis or some full sizes but you can get
a lot in these sets and you can give
them out as gifts a lot of times my
girlfriends and I will exchange gifts
with one another and it's really nice to
be able to put something in there or if
there's anybody else in your life that
you know you just want to put a little
gift basket together towards or maybe
you'd have something ready for someone
but you have that one more item that you
need to add in there some of these like
little makeup items are absolutely
perfect for that so well this one isn't
going to go on my wish list because it's
not something that I need you have been
interested in trying out these glasses
from Marc Jacobs Beauty I suggest
getting this because it's basically just
a couple of dollars more than buying one
full size and you could try out some or
you could keep two for yourself you
could give some for others if you are a
youtuber you can put some and giveaways
because that's a really freaking awesome
prize so I definitely wanted to be sure
to mention this one I did get quite a
few tags on it but right when I saw it I
was like I got to tell you guys about
this one because it made me super
excited so everything that I'm
mentioning if it is for sale right now
and this one is for sale I'll have it
linked it down below but that
Jakob's one something to be iron I was
getting a ton of tags on a bunch of the
Sephora favorite sets
I love the Sephora favorite sets like I
said I typically always purchased the
Sephora give me some nude sets I talked
about their big ol lip collection and
one of my past affiliate videos they
came out with a huge lip collection
which I'm very excited about that one is
on my love's list but I also saw myself
getting tagged on this one quite a bit
and it looks pretty freakin amazing
I'm not gonna lie so this is called
they're superstars every day it must
have it's gonna be 75 dollars that it
says you get three full-size and ten
deluxe size products you get an
anastacio brow wiz you get an original
Beauty Blender at the benefit hoola
bronzer the Bobby Brown
cream shadow stick the Kat Von D locket
setting powder Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
loose powder a Marc Jacobs highlighter
which those are amazing a NARS a Velvet
Matte lip pencil a Smashbox photo finish
primer the Tarte lights camera lashes
mascara the Too Faced melted matte
liquefied long wear matte lipstick also
the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray and then the YSL cushy cloth
radiant touch now that is pretty freakin
awesome so again with these if there is
something in here that you see that you
are super excited about or even like one
two or three things
I honestly think these are worth it I
mean if you want everything in here then
it's definitely going to be a good value
but again think about gifts think about
stocking stuffers think about you know
your kids is teachers there is a lot of
different gift ideas that you could do
for this and that I think would be just
freaking awesome girls nights
I mean seriously there's a lot a lot in
here I kind of look this over for myself
I have quite a few of the items that are
in here so because of that I don't think
this would make it a really good value
for me because I already have a lot of
what is in here and the things that I
don't have I'm not the most interested
in trying but honestly that's not that's
not a lot of things I own or have tried
the majority that is in here so it's not
going to go on my wish list again
because it's just not something that I
need right now but definitely if you
guys are interested in
this or you think you could get some
gift ideas out of this check it out
because these are a really really good
value typically you're able to save a
lot of money try new brands try new
colors try new products things like that
and then always I know that we're only
in September really never too early to
start thinking about gifts and what
you'll be giving family in fronts if you
are someone who does exchange gifts
around the holiday time so that could be
another really really good thing for
this and keep a couple items for
yourself as well so that one is on sale
it will be linked down below it looks
pretty darn good also got tagged on a
skincare set from Itachi I've talked
about Tasha in the past how I've always
wanted to purchase from the brand but
they've just been too pricey I haven't
been able to do it yet so they are
coming out with a holiday set it has a
lip balm in there the water cream which
I hear a ton of good things about the
violet sea radiance mask and then also
the luminous dewy skin mists and the
skin mist is a full-size and then the
other ones I believe are deluxe sizes
that whole set is going to be $59 if you
were to purchase the tatcha luminous
dewy skin mist on its own it's $48 so
basically you're just paying $11 extra
and you're getting some deluxe sized
samples of some of their you know really
well known for products I know that
water cream that was one that I really
looked at for a while so it'd be a way
to try it out so this one got me to do
the double take because I've been
wanting to try Tasha for such a long
time and I don't think that's a bad
price for everything that you're getting
and I know this isn't like a will I buy
it so I'm not saying like yeah I'm gonna
go out and buy it I'm saying oh you know
it caught my attention enough that I'm
gonna put it on my loves list I'm gonna
put it on my wish list etc but something
like held me back honestly I am such a
skincare addict I am I am all about
skincare I'm always preaching about
skincare and taking care of your skin I
love trying skincare I really do
but when I find something that I really
love I tend to stick with it I
repurchase the same items over and over
I continually used the same skincare
brands over and over I mean I've been
used
some of the same brands now that I used
in high school because I become very
loyal to them
and I know that my skin you know works
well with them I'm leery about even
trying kaca because they are so
expensive so what if I get a product and
I fall in love with it and then I have
to go purchase the full size and it's
gonna break my bank like that's gonna
suck so that is kind of what held me
back to be tipping it completely honest
I don't really want to try skincare just
to try skincare I don't treat skincare
like makeup where it's fun to try all
these different things your skin is your
skin and if you treat it badly it gonna
look bad yeah you think I'm not even
gonna put this one on my wish list I
don't think I'm gonna do it let me know
what you guys think in the comments down
below of course as always with
everything that I'm talking about but is
anybody else that way when it comes to
skincare I don't feel like I need to be
switching up a whole lot in my skincare
right now so why bother why even put
this on my wish list by even ask my mom
to go buy it for me when you know I
would rather have something else like
makeup you know so I'm gonna skip over
that one but I'll be curious to hear
your guys's thoughts about the touch'
Holiday Collection so tart is I mean
Tarte cosmetics is doing big things
right now for the holidays you guys I
feel like every day that I wake up
there's a new relation tart and I'm like
oh my gosh they be going crazy over at
Tarte cosmetics I think it quite a few
tags on their treasure box collectors
set this is going to be a $59 and what
it is it says a gift set overflowing
what start treasures from eyeshadow
liner and mascara cheek lipstick
formulas in all new shades I'm reading
off the Sephora app it says you get a 24
piece a shadow palette with there's
blushes in there bronzers and a
highlighter from the storage compartment
to reveal a full-sized sex kitten
eyeliner and travel sizes of tarts
iconic mascara and quick drying matte
lipstick so you're getting a I mean
you're getting a lot of different
products in here a lot it looks very
cool I'll have the best picture I can
insert it down below it looks great but
I'm not gonna put it on my wish list one
thing that I will say that I am pretty
leery on and I know
a lot of people are is that they're
afraid that these holiday sets are not
the same formula as the regular products
that we know and love
I loved hard eyeshadows I think they are
fantastic I love the Tarte blushes I
think they are fantastic but I truly I
do feel the same way and even like I
said with the topic blush bug well it's
not bad it's really not the same tart
quality and for me I would rather
purchase something that's non limited
edition and honestly I'd rather purchase
something that's not in this big giant
box I just don't feel myself gravitating
towards something like that but honestly
I would rather buy their regular
eyeshadows that everybody can get that
everybody will get excited over but I
would rather have in my collection
instead of some of these big ol holiday
crazy releases I feel like when it comes
to holiday releases I don't really
gravitate towards like oh this big giant
eyeshadow palette driver take towards
the sets of things that I'm actually
going to use the lip sets that I think
are really interesting you know even
something like a skincare side you like
the Sephora favorite sets how they come
with with different items in there those
are what I gravitate towards not
something I don't want to say gimmicky
but kind of in a way kind of holiday
gimmicky it's just not really what I'm
into so I mean is it a good value and
are you getting a ton of different heart
products yes you are but I feel like if
you're someone who watches a lot of
YouTube which I think you might be if
you're watching this video it a lot of
people will express their frustrations
with limited edition items and that's
what you're getting for the holidays
people you know two months from now even
aren't gonna say let me pull out my
limited edition treasure box from Tarte
and show you a tutorial with it they're
not gonna do that they're gonna show you
the eyeshadow palettes that are hyped up
and that people want to continue to see
and even when you talk about throwbacks
like I don't think people are gonna be
throwing it back to these holiday
releases they're hot during the holidays
and then that's it so I would rather put
my money towards you know a permanent
product or a set that I would actually
get more value out of so I'm not gonna
be putting this one on my personal wish
list but I would love to know you know
maybe you're someone who collects all
the holiday releases from a certain
brand and that's totally awesome if you
do because that's your choice so I would
love to know
anybody out there is like that if you
love to collect a bunch from tart and
what you are eyeing the most from them
because they got a lot going on two-face
is another brand that that kind of
similar to tart I feel like they are
putting out a lot of different things
and I've almost been confused as like
what's actually a part of their Holiday
Collection they just released the candy
collection in collaboration with candy
Johnson and I'm like what I mean their
holiday releases are already coming out
so I'm fairly confident this is a part
of the holiday releases according to
trend mood it is but we're in talked
about anyways because I've been getting
asked a lot of questions about it so I'm
putting it in this video but this is the
Too Faced boss-lady beauty agenda
reading from the Sephora app it says
it's a limited-edition makeup collection
for eyes lips and face with an exclusive
year-round beauty agenda it says the fun
paper-bound agenda features reminder
stickers 12 exclusive step-by-step
tutorials one for each month of the year
plus exclusive fun facts and beauty tips
from the co-founder of to face which is
Jerrod Blandino and then in addition to
that you're getting all of these
different eyeshadows I think they have a
blush bronzer anti light in there I see
a Too Faced better than sex and then in
Multan lip as well those two look to be
deluxe eyes samples it's going to be $58
so again my first thought when I see
something like this is that I just think
it's kind of gimmicky do they say I feel
like to me is one of those because I've
tried to face holiday releases in the
past even before I've had a youtube
channel and they are definitely a brand
that I feel like their quality from
their holiday releases are really really
bad compared to their actual releases
some of you might know that I've been on
a break from Too Faced from awhile from
buying items from Too Faced
just because I feel like their quality
in general it's just kind of been going
down and so that really worries me what
their holiday releases are going to be
like because you know everybody loved
the chocolate bar palettes and all of
those you know even like the sweet peach
palette I really enjoyed that palette as
well but it was like right around the
time of the sweet peach palette things
just kind of started going downhill for
Too Faced I purchased the white
chocolate chip palette last year and it
was one of the worst actionable palettes
that I have ever tried and from then I
haven't purchased anything else from Too
Faced so I honestly just get a little
concerned if their quality is going down
anyways how much farther is their
holiday quality going to go down
housing a little nervous here I think
like the big thick of this is that
agenda and I would never use that it's
just not something that is for me if
it's something that's for you and you
love those you love these types of
planners if you like the idea of the you
know the tutorials I mean I have no idea
how those are going to be or if they
would actually be worthwhile because I
haven't seen one but you know if that's
if that's your thing and that's your
schtick or you love to purchase the
two-phase holiday releases then then you
got to go ahead and do it and not we're
not gonna tell you no but I'm just gonna
tell you that this would never make it
onto my wish list so no interest in the
two-phase boss'll heavy agenda by far
the most requested item to talk about
the most amount of tags the most amount
of snaps I've been getting the most
amount of YouTube comments is on the Kat
Von D of the saint and sinner I shadow
palette so this is $62 it is limited
edition I'm seeing it available right
now at Sephora and pre-filming cuz I'm
gonna be out of town all weekend but
hopefully it is still available on the
floor website if so I will have that
link down below and the Kat Von D
website if it's still available there
this says it's an Ultra limited
eyeshadow palette with 12 st. and 12
Center shades inspired by the vibrant
stained glass windows of Gothic
cathedrals ready then so I mean the
packaging on this is insane it is insane
like Kat Von D's creativity her artwork
her I mean it's just on another level
like she's on another level I honestly
look up to Kat Von D so much
I know $62 is really really high for an
eyeshadow palette I mean that that is
expensive to me I complain about like
$49 eyeshadow palettes so now we're
talking $62 I think you're paying a lot
for the packaging a lot because that
packaging is it's on another level to be
honest though to be honest I'm not I'm
not even gonna put it I'm not gonna put
it on my wish list like I just said I
love Kat Von D the shade + light eye
palette is one of my holy girl eyes
shadow palettes I absolutely love it so
I'm not even trying to say like I don't
think Kat Von D has good quality makeup
because I think she really does and I
think that she does a great job but this
one to me it didn't catch my attention
it caught my attention as like a bowl
that packaging is crazy but when I'm
actually like really looking at it
it just doesn't catch my attention
enough of course you know we're talking
limited edition because everything is a
limited edition with the holiday times
but I honestly believe that this would
be a pallet that people would really
talk about for a long time and people
would keep bringing up in tutorials
because I think it's a really really hot
ticket item a lot of people are very
excited about it I know a lot of people
are already buying it and that's
fantastic
but for some reason for me I just can't
get into it I've been talking a lot
about consumerism lately and then even
though I'm saying you know this is just
gonna go on my wish list and maybe I can
ask you know someone in my family to get
it for me to put underneath my tree I
just don't think I would because there's
so many other other pallets out there
that really catch my attention even more
and $62.00 is just a really a really
high price even for a gift and I'm also
going to be I've been doing some
declutter lately I'm going to be doing a
show pilot at declutter as well because
eyeshadow palettes are kind of taking
over my life
raise your hand if you guys remember
when I used to say I wasn't an eyeshadow
palette junkie something happened
I would like to blame it on YouTube
biggest thing is and what I say in a lot
of my bullabbai videos and just if
you're trying to decide if you want
something does it whip your head around
so fast because if it does then you
really need to consider if you should
get it and if it works for you if it
doesn't make you have that reaction just
move on to the next thing because look
how many holiday releases are coming out
look at how much makeup is coming out
every single week we are getting
bombarded and the makeup community right
now with releases and new brands and
collaborations it is crazy so if
something doesn't give you that initial
pull just don't even don't try to talk
yourself into it for whatever reason
even if everybody else is getting it and
you feel like you need to be a part of
that move on to the next thing because
probably tomorrow something's gonna come
out and it's gonna give you that double
take you're gonna be like shoot I just
went $62 though on that eyeshadow
palette that I don't think I really need
this was one that I wanted to talk
myself into because I felt like
everybody wanted me to get it I've been
being asked to review it so much I know
a lot of other people are buying it but
I'm like you know what guys it doesn't
give me that pull
I love Kat Von D I love her beauty line
I love a lot of her products but this
one doesn't give me the pull to spend
sixty two dollars and the eyeshadow
palette so even though I'm not gonna buy
it to myself
I'm not even gonna put it on my wish
list I'm not even gonna ask anyone else
to purchase it for me because I just
doesn't give me that initial pull but I
would love to know I know a lot of you
guys are so excited about this one so
let us know in the comments down below
what you think about it and if you are
so excited about it but then after that
that's gonna do it for part two of my
holiday makeup releases so that is
everything a for my holiday makeup
releases a wish list of verses won't
touch video I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this video and learning about
some of the new holiday releases that
are coming out let me know what you are
most excited for that I mentioned in
this video or what you would want to see
in my next holiday releases video it'll
probably come in about two weeks or so
like I said I will have my first video
linked down below this one took me a
little bit longer to get out there
because something went wrong on youtubes
end with that video for some reason my
18 minute video was all of a sudden cut
down to five minutes and it was cutting
me off right after I talked about the
first product and YouTube took about a
week or so to be able to fix the issue
and get it back to normal so if you see
that video it might still say that it's
five minutes that's how it shows on my
end but when you actually click on it
it's an 18 minute video that's a huge
difference and I know that and I'm sorry
about that but when I had planned to
film this part to video I was still
dealing with that I wasn't sure if I was
gonna have to reapplied that video was I
gonna have to refill that video I wasn't
sure so I apologize that this one is
coming a little bit later then I wanted
it to go up but but a part three and you
know who knows I'll just keep going
until we get until we run out of
releases which probably won't happen or
until we get you know a little bit
closer to the holiday time so let me
know what you would want to see in
upcoming holiday videos as well if you
guys did enjoy this video or you found
it helpful I hope that you will give it
a thumbs up I hope that you will also
consider subscribing before you go and I
will catch you guys in tomorrow's video
bye
