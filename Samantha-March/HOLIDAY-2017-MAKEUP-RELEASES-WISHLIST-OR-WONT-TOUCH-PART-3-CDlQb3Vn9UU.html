today's video is going to be another
video focused on holiday and makeup
releases this is Lee part 3 in my wish
list or won't touch a video series I
will have the other two linked down
below in case you're interested and what
I've talked about previously with some
makeup holiday releases I'm just gonna
be touching on a few products here and
then letting you know if I'm planning on
adding them to my wishlist or if I am
not touching them so I'd like to talk
about so I'm gonna go ahead and get
started alright so first up I want to
talk about anasazi Beverly Hills because
she's been releasing lots of stuff so
she did release two new blush kits and
these actually kind of caught me off
guard because she just released blush
trios not that long ago and I don't know
now she's releasing these blush kits
these I'm fairly sure are going to be a
limited edition most holiday releases
are so I don't know if it's just like a
limited edition blush kit thing and the
blush trios are sticking around I have
heard some people say the blush trios
are gonna be going discontinued I'm not
really sure about that but what we do
know right now is that there are these
blush kits and so these are already
available and there's two different
blush kits there's the radiant blush kit
and the gradient blush kit they are $30
each and you get four shades and I
believe you also get a mirror too it's
just really nice they look very similar
to look at the glow kit packaging except
they are blushes looks like really big
pans I'm a little bit torn because I
have gravitated towards them but it's
like I want one to two shades in each
palette you know what I'm saying like in
the gradient palette there's a shade
dusk which a lot of people are saying is
really pretty to contour with like I
would like that also in the blush kit
because the other one the radiant blush
kit you know those are all like your
pinks and like peachy colors for blushes
which is fantastic but I would love to
have just a little bit different of a
shade in there because these kind of
look very very similar I mean a lot of
blush kids do so there's that but they
look a little a little bit too similar I
would like to like flip-flop one or two
of the shades but I mean you know
whatever
makes sense I guess but that's the only
thing that I'm kind of like I don't know
if I would like it or if it would be
like one of those things where I only
reached in for the one shade the one
shade the one shade is it worth $30 I
don't know so I looked at a really long
and hard because they caught my
attention right away but I ended up
talking myself out of even putting them
on my wish list and asking for them
around the holiday time because I just
don't think I would get enough use out
of them and you know if I was gonna buy
it myself I wouldn't wanna spend the $30
because I think I would really only be
reaching in for one shade so that's why
I decided there and I was a little bit
bummed about that but the other item
that she came out with is a new glow kit
and this one caught my attention
immediately this one is called the sugar
glow kit it's $40 like the other little
kids are has the four different shades
in there but I find interesting about
this one is it has some repeat shades
from past glow kits so it has
butterscotch and marshmallow which came
in the sweets glow kit if you watched my
recent highlight declutter video I
actually declutter to anasazi o'clock
it's I declared that glow and then also
my sweets glow kit and in the video I
even said I am I'm the new cloak it the
Anastacio came out with and I think I
want to get that one and so I declutter
do those in mind thinking you know I
might have a new cloak it coming in it
kind of made me feel not as bad but
because this glow kit has two shades in
there from the sweets kit that I
declutter I remember I loved marshmallow
I thought that was such a cool shade
butterscotch I couldn't really wear on
my skin as a highlight but I actually
did wear that on my eyes but it also has
starburst and I can't remember which
original glow kit starburst came in but
I don't think that glow kit is available
anymore and everybody loves starburst I
still see people using starburst so I'm
like I want starburst you know so
there's that and then also gumdrop which
gumdrop looks super super cool in the
swatches my friend Liv from lip loves
her makeup was watching this the other
night and I was like yes yes yes yes yes
I want so the only shade that I'm not
sure I would wear as an actual highlight
would be butterscotch but I feel like
the other ones I would get good use out
of
so at least it's you know three versus
one instead of one versus three like
with the blush kit so I am really
considering this one I am putting it on
my wish list I'm definitely interested
in the sugar glow kit from a Nastasia
but I want to know have you picked up
either the blush kits or the new glow
kits and what do you think about them
give me some feedback so I talked
recently about Becca cosmetics I think
it actually was in a regular will i buy
it video I've been trying to keep my
well I buy it and the holiday videos a
little bit separate but I know I'm kind
of overlapping here and there there's
just so many holiday releases it's just
craziness so I mentioned in the past
video about the Becca like a pres ski
glow eye palette thing and at first like
I was very confused in the video I
didn't know if it was highlights if it
was eye shadows it turns out his eye
shadows they're just their highlights
but reformulated from the eyes I don't
know it was kind of confusing but I
still was like trying to talk myself
into it I was like no you do want this
but I said we have seen a teaser of
something new for the Becca holiday
collection and I want to see what that
is because maybe I would want that and
then we finally found what this is and I
was like yep that is what oh so this is
called the après-ski glow face palette
it is a $54 and it has six different
shades in there so there's a highlighter
in icicle there's a blush and winter
berry which is new there's a bronzer in
bronze a Bondi a luminous blush and
blushed copper a highlighter in opal and
then a highlighter in rose quartz and
I'm so excited and then it once again I
live was watching this on her snapchat
the other night and I just wrote into
her sold with that like dollar signs
flying away you know the that's what I
wrote on because I was like yes I was a
little bit worried about the blush and
bronzer like not a hundred percent that
they would look the greatest on me they
look to be for maybe a bit of a deeper
skin tone so I'm not a hundred percent
those would be great on me which is the
only thing that has me worried the live
is even fairer than me she has it so I'm
like I think I'm just gonna go with it
anyways and I'm really excited about all
these highlights as well so
is opal which I used on opal and I did
declutter it in my highlighter declutter
because it has shattered so I would love
to be able to have that back and I'm
just I'm just like all-around excited
for this I even said my highlight to
clutter video that I need more Becca
highlights I said it I put it out there
and then I saw this and I was like yes I
need you
it is $54 so I'm kind of trying to
decide between Becca and Anastasia
because 54 and 40 that's a lot of
highlights I mean you know I have been
on a highlight no buy but I've been
doing really well so I feel like I
should be rewarded and it's the holidays
and I'm just gonna go ahead and put this
one on my wish list - I need to decide
once it really comes down into buying
what holiday releases I want to do
probably gonna have to decide between
the two so wagon let me know which one
you think I need more but as of right
now the Becca one is also on my wish
list you guys know I was getting a lot
of tags on this next one and my eyes
went approximately something like that
some new holiday releases from Natasha
de Nonna oh yes so she has two new
eyeshadow palettes for the holidays
there is joyeux and I don't know if
that's pronounced Aries my dog's name is
areas and she's not looking at me like
did you need me you need me to come on
camera our limited edition most holiday
releases are and they are 48 dollars
each and they each have 5 different
shades so Joya is like joy have reminded
me of the sunset palette from Natasha
Nonna or like the color pop yes please
with the yellows the Reds the
cranberries the golds things like that
and then Aries is every time areas have
a really beautiful blue in there and it
also has some of the Reds too and what
looks to be like a gold so these are
very interesting I mean they definitely
commented to my attention I have been
wanting to try
Natasha Nonna for so long and I've
talked about her in so many videos but
her regular eyeshadow palettes are very
very expensive I mean even these just
for 5 shades it's 48 dollars and you
know that is pretty pricey for
what you are getting so and also I
thought this was interesting it says
that featuring a new formula combined
with the classic formulas and that I get
a little flustered how fast companies
switch up their formulas especially when
you have a formula that clearly works
and it's still loved like the nataschab
banana I'm like why are you feeling the
need to change it up it's just kind of
strange to me but I'm definitely
interested in both of these palettes I
put both of them on my personal wish
list because I'm like um yes are you
kidding me that looks amazing
I don't know what having to pick I
almost want to say that I would want the
Joya because it's like the sunset
palette and the yes please but guess who
got the yes please palette from color
but this girl right here my friend
Candice she sent it to me and I was like
girl no you did it no you didn't yeah so
I'm gonna be using that in a video
coming up soon which I'm super excited
about so that almost makes me pull more
towards Ares and want to get that one
there's that really cool blue in there
they're still that red in there that I
you know been talking about how much
I've loved that so I feel like I would
almost if I had to choose I feel like I
would actually gravitate more towards
Ares just because I feel like now I
maybe wouldn't need the joy of one so
that's what I'm thinking and if I decide
to purchase these myself
I think I might actually do it because I
know it's $48 for five shades and that's
still expensive but I would really like
to be able to just try the Natasha Genoa
eyeshadows and see if there's something
that I bust hyped over as everybody else
and then would it be worth it for me to
consider investing in one of her larger
more expensive eye shadow palettes
Natasha Winona you are on my wish list
you're pretty much always on my wish
list I would love to know if you guys
are putting these on your wish liver
have you tried the Natasha janata yet or
do you think it's a better idea to start
off small and then work your way up like
I'm planning to do let me know some
feedback
urban decay is releasing a new heavy
metal holiday collection this includes a
metallic eyeshadow palette and heavy
metals which has 20 shades and it's $55
and then also a new vice metal
meets matte lipstick palette which is
six shades for $35 and they also
introduced new heavy metal glitter liner
so there are six different shades of
those and so that these will all be
available October 15th on the line and
then it looks like October 29th in
stores so one of the things that caught
my attention first actually was those
heavy metal glitter liners I have
Midnight Cowboy I think is what it's
called it came in one of those Sephora
sets that I purchased last year I think
it was and I actually really really
liked it it is a good glitter a good
glitter liner it didn't burn my eyes I
was very impressed with that
so when I saw at new shades were coming
out I was like those actually would not
be a bad purchase at all
the lip palette I mean I know that I
would skip over the lip palette because
I've talked about it before lip palettes
aren't something that's super practical
for me I am NOT a makeup artist and I
have no future plans on becoming a
makeup artist or like a building a kit
or anything like that for doing makeup
on other people so for just like your
average consumer to me to me it isn't
practical I know other people avoid in
saying like why they think lip palettes
are better for them and that's great but
for me they just don't make a ton of
sense
definitely the eyeshadow palette the
heavy metals eyeshadow palette it looks
really cool the packaging is very
interesting on it with the mirror like
in the middle of it and then it has
different shades the ten different
shades on each side I don't think I
would get it though because I don't
think I would get the most use out of it
and when I'm buying items that are more
expensive I want to really feel
confident that I'm going to be reaching
into them a lot and it looks like
there's really no matte shades in here
it's all those the shimmer shades and
the glitter shades things like that and
it actually has quite a fair amount of
neutrals it's not all just super
colorful or anything but I still just
don't think that I would reach for it on
a super consistent basis and there's
other eyeshadow palettes that I'm
purchasing you know I've already talked
about how many items I'm putting on my
wish list for the holidays that you know
I'll probably get a handful of them
myself so this didn't give me a double
take and that's my biggest indicator of
not needing to talk myself into
something if something doesn't grab my
attention right
way I can just move on move on to the
next item and that one just didn't give
me the pull but if you love urban decay
I can totally see if you're really
excited about this at first sure and one
thing that I would really would
recommend are those glitter liners I
think they're really good if you love
glitter if you're a big fan of glitter
liners and you haven't tried the urban
decay yet I definitely do think that
they are worth it because I really
really do enjoy mine one more item that
I want to talk about and it is a set
I was just casually very casually
browsing the Sephora app and this one
popped up and I was like I'm gonna go
ahead and click on that this is from
milk makeup it's called the 18 so it
says it's a gift set of travel sized
versions of milk makeups best selling
sticks I personally really enjoy a lot
from milk makeup so I was like mmm what
what do you got in here because I'm also
a sucker for sets it's just it is what
it is so there's a glitter stick and
Technology matte bronzer in baked the
highlighter in lit the cooling water the
blur sick and the holographic stick in
Mars and these are all minis but it is
$39 for the six products and I was like
that is not a bad price at all that
actually had me pretty excited I
definitely got interested it was like do
I need this do I but I decided that for
me myself I don't need it because I do
have the blur stick and I also do have
the holographic stick I have full sizes
of them and like I feel like I'm never
going to go through them maybe the blur
stick actually I should look at my blush
so I can see how much is used up because
I really I used that thing quite a bit
I've always wanted to try the cooling
water stick I've heard good things about
that I have the cleanser and the toner
sticks as well and I think they're
really good I have a hydrating oil stick
I thought that was awesome in the summer
so I was kind of hoping maybe one of
those would be in there because then I
totally would have bought it to have
like travel-size even though those are
super easy to travel with and they
almost always come with me because
they're so handy cause like I totally
would have done it but for me since I
already own two of the items and I
really only want to try like I really
really have been eyeing the cooling
water I bet that I would like the matte
bronzer the glitter stick doesn't catch
my attention too much I bet that I would
like the bronzer and the
but then I also do have the Mars
highlighter so it's like another
highlighter I already added so many
highlights to my wish list that is a
little ridiculous it's like you know I
don't think this would be great for me
but I think this would be a really good
set if you are interested in some of
these items or you've wanted to try milk
makeup this I think would be a good one
or it could even be a good you know set
to give away or even if you have a
couple different girlfriends you know
you could give them a mini a piece or
two minis or whatever it is and that's
why I really enjoy buying at the holiday
sets myself because I feel like they're
really good to be able to gift either as
a whole set or you can break it up break
up the items inside amongst other people
so I thought that was definitely really
interesting so I did want to mention
this one because it caught my attention
right away so that's $39 for six minis
ok so that's gonna do it for this
holiday makeup releases video wish list
versus a OneTouch Bush let's really
expanded after this video but um that's
ok that's that's what happens I would
