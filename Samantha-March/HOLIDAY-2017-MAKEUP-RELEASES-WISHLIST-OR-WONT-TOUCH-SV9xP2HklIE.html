today's video is going to kick off a new
series on the channel it's gonna be all
about the holiday and makeup releases
for 2017 and I'm going to call it
wishlist vs. won't touch it especially
there are always a ton of makeup and
beauty releases around the holiday
season they typically start coming out
as early as September which is very very
soon which is crazy but I've been trying
to think of something that I could do
where I could talk about the holiday
releases let you know what they are and
all of that fun information but then
also put my own little spin on it I
thought I'm doing the will I buy it for
a couple of the holiday releases but
then I thought I want this to be its own
series there's already so much coming
out about the holiday makeup releases so
I thought I'm gonna put my own little
spin on it once again and I'm gonna let
you know if holiday makeup releases are
on my wish list or if I will not be
touching them so that you guys will
leave me some comments below let me know
what you think about the series idea
thank you to everyone on my snapchat
that helped me come up with this and now
why don't we go ahead and get started
and chat about some holiday makeup
releases this video was actually a
little bit harder than I thought to kick
off the series with because a lot of the
items that are coming out as a part of a
holiday release we only are kind of
getting a little sneak peeks of it right
now so I want to do this series maybe
like twice a month up until we get a
little bit closer to the holidays and I
can talk about the items that we already
kind of know more about either the dates
or the pricing or just what's all
included definitely the one that I
wanted to kick it off with because I've
been getting so many questions about it
is a new holiday release from Tarte
cosmetics they are coming out with their
baked blush book free so I recently
talked about the blush books I think it
was in my latest makeup that I regret
not buying right I think it was in that
video I'll leave it link down below I
talked about the Tarte blush books
because they have come out with two
other volumes of these and they have
eight different blushes inside I
recently was able to try out the Tarte
blushes and I fell in love with them so
then that's what kind of made me regret
not being in the blush books because I
was like me and those blushes are
actually really good and I could have a
big ol book full of ton of different
blushes like that would have been
awesome and I even said in the video I
wonder if Tarte will come out with a new
one around the holiday time and so many
of you guys tagged me I almost put
and of will I buy it but then I was
really trying to come up with a series
idea for the holiday makeup releases so
so many of you we're taking me over on
Instagram and letting me know on
snapchat like hey this is here are you
gonna buy it what are you gonna do so
I'll have a photo of it in here it is
still available on the Tarte website
which is awesome it actually released
the day before I'm filming this video
and I thought for sure it would sell out
right away so it's $60 and you're
getting eight different blushes I think
that is an amazing price I was super
excited when I saw it but but I don't
think I'm going to get it and that
surprises me a little bit but when I did
mention it that lush book in my regret
video a lot of people let me know that
my friend Olivia from live loves her
makeup has actually chatted about these
blush books in the past and she has said
the books that were made in China are
not as good quality a lot of times the
problem with these holiday releases is
that and I have found this myself too
when I've tried makeup that as part of
like a holiday collection it's not the
same as the regular makeup that a brand
releases and that is definitely super
confusing to me I don't understand why
we're getting different quality and I
think that's like incredibly Shady
so I guess live actually reviewed that
in one of her videos so when a lot of
people are saying that I was like that's
something to consider and so I was
watching live the other day too and she
said I'm pretty sure I have this correct
but I'm still sitting in a house with no
internet so I can't even go back and
check but I think she said if the blush
book is made in China then it's not
going to be the same quality of the
blushes that Tarte would normally
produce and now that this is available
for sale on the Tarte website if I click
on ingredients and I scroll through all
the ingredients there's a little thing
right down here that says Made in China
so I'm like oh no is it not going to be
the same quality so to spend $60 on
blushes I'm like if I'm not getting the
actual like fantastic Amazonian clay
blushes that Tarte is known for why
would I want to pay $60 on a blush book
like that you know so I have to say that
reading the comments like
on the regret video and then hearing
what live had to say when she was
talking about the blush books it put
like some skepticism in my mind and so
when the book actually did release I was
like I'm just feeling a little
conflicted I'm not sure whether I should
get it so what I'm actually gonna do is
wait for the reviews to come in because
I know some people have been find the
book so I'm gonna wait for some reviews
to come in and then see what people have
to say and if people are saying that it
is really good it's just like the other
Tarte blushes then it's gonna go on my
wish list if people are like this is not
anything like the Tarte blushes it's
like once again a dud it's no good then
definitely I will not be touching the
blush book because when I buy it I want
to buy the actual part Amazonian clay
fantastic blushes I don't want to buy
something that's not as good I just
that's one thing about holiday releases
that honestly I feel like I'm skeptical
of a lot of holiday releases because I
don't understand why there's a
difference I just I don't get it and it
makes me very angry as a consumer but
this one I held off for right now I
didn't buy it the day that it released
and now it's the day after it's still
available on Tarte and I'm still not
gonna buy it I'm gonna wait for those
reviews to come in and if people are
telling me that it's really good and
then I have to have it it'll go on my
wish list if that I'm not touching it oh
it's coming out with some new holiday
releases one thing that they're coming
out with is the smoke bomb with foil vol
4 it's a foiled eyeshadow palette it's
going to be $14.50 and it includes a
three different shades I just see it as
coming soon I'm reading from trend mode
like I do in a lot of my will i buy
videos so I'll have her Instagram list
it down below so there is a photo that I
can insert in here as well honestly so
it's it's an eyeshadow palette it has
the three foiled shades its 1450 which I
guess isn't a bad price it's just not
something that made me do any sort of
double take or like whoo and it says
this is a volume for I've not even
familiar with volumes one two or three
and I'm so sorry I maybe some of you are
and let us know what you thought if you
fat enough but I actually don't own a
whole ton from the balm I think I own a
highlight and then a blush and I think
that is it I have
ever tried their eyeshadows and I guess
I've just never really liked they
haven't just caught my attention a lot
so I know that I'm gonna go ahead and
say that I won't touch the eyeshadow
palette from the balm it looks cute it
looks like a pretty neutral palette with
some foil like that's cool but it's just
not enough to get me really hooked and
then the other item that I see right now
that the bomb is coming out was before
the holidays is a set of minis this is
their meet Matt Hughes minis it's going
to be six different mini lipsticks for
$29 I think these are their liquid
lipsticks if I'm saying that correctly
now I do hear really good things about
the meet Matt Hughes lipsticks when I
was talking about the bomb in one of my
past videos that is actually well got
recommended to me the most were the
lipsticks and then the blush as well but
I think the lipsticks a lot of people
were saying you should try them meet
Matt Hughes and I love buying sets I
don't mind it all buying minis or deluxe
samples like I always get to Sephora
give me some nude lip set I don't mind
it at all it's super hard to go through
makeup but again I'm gonna have to say
that I won't touch this it does look
interesting to me there's one nice nude
in there but then the other ones look to
be more pink and red and I just know
that I wouldn't actually be trying all
of the lipsticks like I feel like maybe
there's two shades in there that I would
really enjoy so it's like is it worth it
buy a set I don't know it might be worth
it just be able to try out the formula
to see if I do like it but I just know
it's not necessary right now I need to
do another lipstick declutter in my near
future because my lipstick collection is
really really out of control right now
so it's just like I know that I don't
need it I know it's not something that
I'm going to use every single shade out
of there so isn't worth it for me
probably not so for the bomb or the
eyeshadow palette in the mini lipsticks
that they're coming out with for the
holiday season
I'm gonna say won't touch on either of
them Stila Cosmetics has quite a few new
releases coming out as well so they're
gonna have different sets of mini stay
all day liquid lipsticks looks like
there's three different sets they're
gonna be $20 apiece or they have the
star-studded 8 set which has eight mini
liquid lipsticks and that's gonna be $45
they're also gonna have a glitterati
glitterati lip top coat which is $22
they're also going to have written in
the stars
and that's us starts written in the
stars I think is what it's meant to say
it's a glitter and glow liquid eye
shadow set minis of Diamond dusk in
karma and smoky storm and that's $25 all
right then they're also going to have
their extreme lash mascara and
waterproof liquid eyeliner for $25
they're also going to have a mat if
esand mat set that's going to be their
Black Friday special at Ulta beauty is a
lip liner and then also a lipstick for
$18 that is so much information okay oh
my word that is crazy I don't even know
where to begin so I will say for their
stay all day liquid lipsticks I'm not
gonna touch these because this is super
embarrassing but I think it was sometime
last year the set was on sale it was
either I want to say was that Ulta like
it was on sale at Ulta so I bought it it
was a set of 3 mini a liquid lipsticks
and I never touched it I never opened it
I didn't do anything like that's really
embarrassing I ended up actually putting
it in a giveaway cuz I was like oh my
gosh I've had this set sitting here for
weeks and I haven't even opened it so I
ended up giving it away and so yeah I'm
not gonna go ahead and purchase another
set I think it was I think sometimes
it's just because I buy so much lipstick
that I overwhelmed myself and I just
couldn't bring myself to open another
lipstick it was almost like I felt bad
about doing it so I know that I need to
stay away from this lipstick set that's
really embarrassing to say actually like
I'm embarrassed for myself that that
happened so and then also the 8 minis
it's just I know I just know no one else
Mantha don't touch them don't do it
don't do it girl you guys probably
already know if you watch my videos the
glitterati lip topcoat not gonna touch
it not in the glitter lips not into
metallic it's not for me the written in
the stars the glitter and glow liquid
eye shadow set so you get
Mini's for $25 I will say did have an
amazing subscriber it Sumitra she
actually sent me a handful of the
glitter eyeshadows from Stila and I was
able to try them out I was wearing one
of them in my latest makeup monthly
video I can leave it link down below I
think I was wearing the rose gold retro
I want to say in that video so far I I
really do like them I really do I'm
gonna keep testing them out so I can
actually review them so I can like give
my thoughts and feedback because I've
been so hard pressed like I couldn't
decide was I gonna get him was I not
gonna get them I decided not to get them
someone sent them to me I was able to
try and so I really want to review them
but from what I've tried so far I think
they're pretty good so well I wouldn't
need to buy a set because now I have my
own which is so cool I don't think three
minis 425 is a bad price because a
regular one I believe is $24 so I don't
think that's a bad price and that might
be pretty good if you've been wanting to
try them out but you haven't yet maybe
you try that one but for me I'm not
gonna touch it because I have them so I
don't need them the mascara the liquid
liner I don't need at all so I won't be
touching that the Magnificent matte set
it's a lip liner and a lipstick again
I'm not going to touch because I'm so
afraid that I'm just not gonna open up
and it's gonna turn into a super
embarrassing situation so so I won't be
touching anything so far from the Stila
holiday release I don't know if this is
going to be everything it's like new
information is popping up every single
day so they could have more coming out
but from everything that I just
mentioned I won't be touching it because
of the reasons that I stated but I would
say that I think that three set money
for the glitter eyeshadows that could
actually be a good deal and I might
actually have put it on my wish list had
I not gotten some of the individuals in
my vo box so just saying that the let us
know what you think about the the Stila
holiday releases and what you are
interested in so coverfx is also going
to come out with some minis they're
gonna have their custom enhancer drops
it will be four different shades and
there will be minis of them there's no
price on it yet that I see it says it's
gonna come out October 7th so if by the
time this video goes up I can insert a
price but I'm not
100% what the price will be but
basically you're getting for many of
their custom enhancer drops they
actually do have a mini of one of the
coverfx drops this is in moonlight I
have used it a couple of times now like
super super pretty like these are
gorgeous but because I already do own a
mini and honestly I mean I'm gonna have
this my whole life because you need a
very very small amount and it's gonna
get you a long way so I wouldn't need to
have other minis in my collection you
know what I'm saying like maybe if I
didn't have this and I still wanted to
try out the custom enhancer drops
because people went like bananas over
this when it first came out so maybe if
I didn't have this and I want to try it
out I would consider putting it on my
wish list but because I already have one
and because I like this one just fine
and because I'm still on a highlight no
buy I broke it the other day I have a
challah coming soon I broke my highlight
no buy but I'm gonna get back on the
horse I know that I can pass over the
set of the cover FX custom enhancer
drops but like I said I did really like
this so if you would want to try them
out I'd say it would probably be a
pretty good deal to try out four of them
if you love highlights and you want to
try a couple more but for me I'm not
gonna be touching that set last item
that I want to talk about actually like
as I'm sitting down filming this video
trend mood just post it surprise
available now and I'm like oh my gosh
what just came out it's from hourglass
cosmetics they're coming out with a new
holiday release it's their ambient
lighting edit volume three with rose
gold packaging it's a limited edition as
most holiday releases typically are and
it is $80 it says featuring three
best-selling shades and three new shades
so I'll insert a photo in here so that
you can see it so I had never tried the
hourglass ambient powders until I did my
full face using samples challenge and I
ended up actually really liking them I
did think that they were really pretty
and once I actually did try them I was
like oh I think I kind of actually
understand what the hype is about thank
you so it's funny because if I hadn't
done that sample challenge or I hadn't
gotten the samples of the hourglass I
would totally be up here right now being
like nope not touching you because
that's what I've done in the past but I
did try them and they were really nice
but
eighty dollars is so expensive you know
what I'm saying that's expensive and I
know it's for six different shades an
hourglass is you know obviously a
high-end brand and you can find them at
Sephora and they're known for being a
little bit more pricey but I don't think
I don't think I could do it I don't
think I could do it maybe one of their
smaller ones like I could start out with
a smaller palette like I think they have
like three pan palettes as well maybe I
could start out with something like that
because even though I said that I did
really like them in the sample challenge
the couple of shades that I tried which
was only two different shades I believe
they were very very light like they were
very pretty but they were a little bit
too light so I don't know if this is
something that would be worth the $80 I
don't know if all of the shades would
work out for me
and then I don't know if they would have
kind of like the intensity and kind of
payoff that I typically go for the
swatches do look nice but I'm gonna have
to say I won't touch it I'm gonna have
to say I won't touch it I'm just seeing
this for the first time as I was sitting
down I saw that trend would said
surprise this is now out I'm looking at
it for the first time and I it looks so
beautiful the packaging looks beautiful
the shades look beautiful everything
looks beautiful about it but it's $80
and I just even if I put it on my
holiday wish list and I like asked
somebody else to buy it for me I would
just feel too bad like I would rather
get something a little bit more
practical for me yep I'm doing it I'm
standing firm I'm standing firm I'm
saying I'm not gonna touch it let us
know though I know a lot of people
really like these a lot of people have
recommended them to me as well I'm glad
that I was able to try them out in my
sample challenge but I don't think it
would be a smart move for me to buy the
6-pin palette for $80 I don't think it's
gonna be a smart idea so I'm gonna go
ahead and pass over it let us know what
you think and if you've bought the other
two palettes as well I would love to
know but I'm gonna stand firm and say no
to the hourglass holiday release okay so
that's gonna be everything for my first
video in my holiday makeup releases wish
list versus won't touch video please let
me know what you think about this video
series and if you want to see more from
them what holiday releases do you want
to see like I said I want to be able to
keep doing this video you know maybe
