many issues right now issue number one
is a blizzard outside I'm staring at
snow and I'm so unhappy but I've had so
many technical problems oh I'm just I'm
in a bad mood I probably shouldn't be
filming but welcome back to my channel
how are you today hopefully you're
better than I am right now today's video
is a really exciting one because it is
going to feature a big giveaway now my
original idea for this video was I
wanted to feature like holiday
collections because I was just a part of
a holiday novella collection that came
out all i want for christmas so i was
going to do like a top-five tuesday type
thing and do top 5 holiday collections
and then i started talking to other
authors on social media and i decided
let's just turn it into like a whole
holiday video so i have a bunch of
holiday books to feature and then also
every book that i mentioned is going to
be a part of a giveaway so one winner
international 18 or over please will win
all of these books that i mentioned they
will all be ebooks except for one i have
one audio book for you to win so I'm so
excited I'm so grateful to all these
authors who have put their books out for
this giveaway I think that is so cool of
them I'm so excited to be doing one
featured around the holidays because it
is that time of year obviously it's
snowing so I mean tis the season I'm
clearly really ready like like I don't
know k you guys read my shirt it says if
it's snowing I'm not going can you guys
read it yeah it's snowing I'm not going
anywhere I'm quite unhappy if you guys
can't tell okay anyway let's go this
video started I will mention all of the
books give a little story about them and
then at the end of the video will be the
giveaway information so let's get into
realize you probably can't read my full
shirt so it says if it's snowing I'm not
going okay hopefully you guys could read
it
time I realized you can't read it the
other time you could only read if it's
snowing which it is I'm an Iowa we have
6 to 10 inches expected tonight Ruby get
started with this video the first book
that I'm going to mention is of course
all i want for christmas this is the
book that was recently released by my
publishing company marching inc it
features for holiday novellas one from
myself one from kat lavoie and then to
from Laura Chapman so you get for
holiday novellas in there each book
focuses around christmas and new years
and just the holiday season so i will be
giving away one ebook that will be
included in this giveaway and then when
i mention that i was having technical
difficulties if you guys have watched
some of my previous videos you will know
how much i absolutely hate my surface i
have a surface too there's always
problems with it well as of right now it
won't turn on the screen is just black I
checked it a few minutes before i went
to start this video to make sure it was
charged because it never will hold a
charge and it was charged it was fine i
was working fine and then i went to grab
it to film this video and nothing i
plugged it in i was like did it die in
10 minutes that I had it unplugged I
plugged it in it won't work I hit the
button and it makes the noise like it's
going to power on and then the screen is
just black so I don't know if it died we
haven't even had it a year yet but you
know if you guys want to buy a surface I
suggest you don't so because I film off
of my phone I have ordered a real camera
but it is not here yet i film off my
phone so this is going to be a very
interesting video to try to show you all
these books because i really don't have
anything physically to show you i did
just purchase like a video editing
program so hopefully i can somehow put
these covers in this video but if not i
don't know what to do all of the links
for the books that i mentioned will be
below so i don't know i also don't have
anything to read off of so this is going
to be quite the difficult video to make
i 100% blame us know
one hundred percent blame it book
included in the giveaway called Merry
Christmas Eve and this is by Susie Jay
and we follow Eve and I believe in the
blurb it said she was a self-proclaimed
Christmas addict and she gets snowed in
in an airport and then romance is there
this is a most of the books in this
giveaway are going to be like novellas
or short stories around the holidays
that just kind of seems like what the
theme is so just so you guys know almost
I'm pretty sure every single book that
I'm going to mention is either a novella
or short story so just to throw that out
there so the blurbs are very like short
and sweet and to the point but that's
because they're shorter books but that
is Merry Christmas Eve by CJ and then
the next one that will be included is a
another collection of novellas and it
was called merry and bright and it says
it features six tails of holiday cheer
so you'll get 6 holiday stories in merry
and bright and then the publisher of
merry and bright is my good friend Lucy
Simone and she also offered up a bonus
ebook with this one as well so not only
were they going to contribute merry and
bright but she's also going to give you
guys petit four and I feel like I'm not
saying that right cuz it's like a French
name I don't know if there's like some
sort of accent I'm supposed to put on it
but it's called petit four and she said
it was kind of holiday themed because
it's all about cakes you know cakes are
pretty holidays but I thought the cover
was pretty festive as well and this one
is also a collection and it says it's
four stories frost it with love I've
actually read it I've highly enjoyed it
it really is all about cake but it's
super sweet so those two ebooks will
also be included and another one
included is early bird special and this
is by Tracy creamer again if you guys
have watched my videos I have read three
novels from a Tracy creamer I've given
them all five stars I rave about here on
YouTube and on jiggle applause I just
really enjoy her house
author so she has early bird special
which actually is like a Thanksgiving
novel and I had originally planned on
doing this video like later into
December and then I was like you know
what I'm going to move it up because I
really want to include this book just
because I love Tracy's work so much like
I would love for one of you guys to be
able to win it so she is contributing
early bird special it's a short story of
course and it is featured around
Thanksgiving the next one up is
Christmas at cranberry cottage and this
is by tally Rowland and I actually just
finished reading this one I think I have
Fred like every single one of Kelly's
books but she always puts out a short
story near the holiday time I've read
all of those as well but this is
Christmas at cranberry cottage and it
follows Jess who basically is trying to
save like her grandmother's home her
cottage that she always wants the
holidays on she is about to lose it for
like construction and things like that
and she tries to save it and of course
there's romance involved if you guys
can't guess all of these books that I'm
going to talk about our like women's
fiction or Chiclets so of course a big
part of it not only is it you know
holiday-themed would but of course
there's probably going to be romance in
every single book that I talk about so
in case you guys are new to the channel
you don't know what type of books that I
read or feature it's usually women's
fiction and Chiclets my favorites the
next one is how to bake the perfect
Christmas cake and this is by Gina
henning and this will be the book that
is an audio book that you will receive
in the giveaway and this is part of the
home for the holidays series and this is
book number two I believe there are four
total out there so again check below the
amazon links will be down there for all
of the books in this series if you guys
want to check them out as well another
one that will be included in the
giveaway as completions and connections
and this is by Kathryn are Beal and says
it is a romantic holiday novella and we
follow christine and she has a list of
resolutions and one of those resolutions
happens to be falling in love so that is
where the romance it plays a part in
this
Ella sang like a few books and then I'm
like wait I gotta tell you guys
something else but you know of course
obviously it's dark because I've been
sitting in all these videos that I don't
know when the Sun was last shining and I
will can't remember so I'm filming with
the flash on which is just blinding me
so then I'm trying to read on my
computer so I can say like the names of
the characters and maybe what the book
is about and I can't see the computer
screen I can't even see my list like I
have the list of books to talk about I
can't even see the list like I have to
wait and pause and like try to let my
eyes readjust so I can finally read my
list because there's just spots
everywhere because the splash is like
bright but the next one is sex snow and
mistletoe and this is by Laura Bernard
and I actually just got done reading it
this morning it is a short story of
course of course and it uh it features
Melinda it's so fresh in my baton that
I'm kind of laughing but it features
Melinda who basically she is on her way
to a wedding and she's involved in like
a car accident and then there's a man
involved there's some sex involved then
there's some question as to who he
actually is and if she did an okay thing
getting with this guy but it was really
cute as a lot of fun to read I think it
literally took me like just the morning
to read because it was a pretty quick
one but it had me laughing okay the next
one is a cowboy for Christmas and this
is by Jenny martes and it says it is a
part of the between the pages again it
was called a holiday novella of course
and then jenny was also so kind to offer
up a another collection and this one one
is called mischief under the mistletoe
oliday hotties just waiting to be
unwrapped and it features a lot of
little novellas and short stories and
there you are going to get a lot with
this one so I hope you guys are excited
for your holiday reading list goes
you're in up a lot going on the next one
is a miracle at Macy's here comes my dog
funnily enough this is
at Lynn Marie Holzman and it says
miracle at Macy's there's only one dog
who can save Christmas is obviously I
love dogs so I was like probably I need
to read this one to the next one is
survival of the Christmas spirit and
this is by Amy Horton and first of all
this cover I was like yes but it calls
it a humorous holiday novella and like
the first line of the blurb says cooking
for 19 people will be a cinch and then
goes on to talk about how maybe that's
not quite so simple as you guys maybe
know if you watch my previous videos I
don't find cooking for one to be a cinch
the next one the last one I believe is
the fling thing and this is by Maggie
LePage and I thought it was so cute
because she called it a Christmas
quickie which kind of made me laugh so
we follow Becky Jordan who is a travel
consultant and it says that she has a
lot of like flirty banter with another
of her fellow travel consultants and
she's okay knowing that that's all the
farther it will go but is she so that is
the last one that will be included in
hive away I think we have some what made
it through this video hopefully i really
hope i can be able to put these covers
in here for you guys i will try my
hardest my last video it was the morphe
video was the first time that I used the
new like video editing software thingy
jiggy that I got and I was able to do a
few like cool things that I couldn't do
prior but I know like not everything was
like smooth with in there was just like
random sounds being played at some
points but I will you know obviously
keep working at it hopefully get better
at it but my biggest thing is I really
hope I will be able to put covers on
that because obviously might disdain for
the surface but I know it was kind of
hard to see the covers on the surface
anyways when I was trying to show you
guys but hopefully we will get that all
squared away but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I hope you're excited for the
giveaway I really don't even know how
many books are included in here and
honestly just in case there might be
more books coming because I'm still
having author
