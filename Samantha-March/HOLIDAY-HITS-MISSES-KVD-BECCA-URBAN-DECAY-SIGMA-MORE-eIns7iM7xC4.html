today's video is going to be all about
holiday makeup releases and my reviews
for them I have quite a few products
here to talk about quite a few brands
here to talk about I'm going to be
sharing swatches and my reviews my
thoughts on all of these holiday a
makeup releases so if you are ready to
get started we need to go ahead and jump
into it like I mentioned I have a lot of
releases to talk about I actually wasn't
sure if I should break this up into two
separate videos or do one longer video I
took a poll on my snapchat and the
majority vote but quite a few actually
at the end was to do a one long video
coming into it the first brand that I
want to talk about is a sigma Beauty
Sigma released the creme at de couture
Holiday Collection so one of the items
in there is their i shadow palette this
is called the creme de kat or pressed
color palette so inside you do have a
mirror with the pellet and then you have
a bunch of very beautiful pastel shades
we did get this a palette is sent it to
me from Sigma Beauty I am an affiliate
with a Sigma I do also get sent at PR
from time to time from Sigma I don't get
sent everything from them but I did
receive but their holiday collection
which I was very excited about because
to be honest I'm not sure if I would
have picked up this palette for myself
because I'm not immediately drawn to
these pastel looks and I only have one
other all pastel palette and I felt like
that was good enough for me for if I do
want to you know create a more pastel
look but I will say that this is a
really really nice I shadow palette the
colors in here really quite surprised me
because when I think of a pastel
eyeshadow palette I think very light and
very soft shades but you know most of
them looked that way in the pan but they
are actually incredibly pigmented like
this purple is absolutely popping that
is what is on the outer part of my eye I
tried to do a mixture of the three
palettes that I'm going to talk about in
this video on my eyes and that purple is
what I have on the outer v mi eye this
blue is absolutely poppin you should be
able to see in the swatches this green
is absolutely incredible as well this is
a really cool like funky neon purple it
absolutely beautiful I have been a very
impressed with this palette I have done
at least one Instagram tutorial with
this palette as well so I will have any
of my Instagram tutorials that I've done
with these products that I'm talking
about
I will also have them linked in the
description box but this is one really
nice palette if pastels are your thing
and you would like to create those kinds
of looks I would definitely suggest this
one because I've been very pleasantly
surprised with this it is a $39 a so it
definitely is a little bit pricier I
enjoy that you get a mirror it's also
nice and small and compact if you do
want to travel with it it does make it
easy to store but I have been super
impressed with this palette the other
items that they released are a liquid
lipsticks which I was a very excited
about because I tend to prefer a liquid
lipstick they have a four that they
released I do have two of them in my
holiday giveaway that's going on now and
I kept these two for myself the shades
that I kept are in new mod which is
described as a nude mob of a play on
words there and then this other one is a
Fox Club which is described as a bright
black berry I tried this one out in a
trying new makeup video and I
immediately fell for it and then I also
wore it in cult favorite makeup products
that I do not own I have that lipstick
on again because I've actually been
really loving it I would have thought
that I would gravitate more towards the
new buff but for some reason this bright
pink has just been calling for me lately
I've been wearing this one so much the
liquid lipsticks are $15 would recommend
these as well I found them to be
incredibly a long-lasting which I
thought was fantastic I also like the
way that they feel on the lips
I don't like super drying liquid
lipsticks I mean really who does if they
make your lips feel uncomfortable and
these ones are not super drying but I
will say when you apply it it's almost
like it's a drier formula because it it
dries very quickly on the lift you do
have to work quickly because of course
we got lipsticks dried down completely
but these write down really really fast
so I suggest doing two cuts on the
bottom lip and then two coats on the top
lip don't do top and bottom top and
bottom because it's probably already be
dry and like hard to move around and
reapply but I thought the lasting power
was really good they do feel comfortable
on the lips I love these two shades in
particular I'm really happy with both so
next
I have a set here from tatcha and I'm
actually a little confused because as I
pulled up the Sephora website and try to
click on it it said they no longer have
this product you can still see it on the
support page but when you click on it it
says sorry we do not carry this product
anymore I don't know if that's an error
because I thought this was the holiday
set that ought to release tickets though
I don't know if they already sold out of
it if it's going to be coming back if it
is back I've only get down below if it's
not I will just have these individually
linked out so it's called the touch up
best sellers kit it's $59 on the Sephora
website I actually got this sent to me
from my friend limb from limb loss her
makeup I will have her channel illicit
down below because she actually sent me
another item that will be featured in
this video - I was so excited because I
featured this in a holiday wishlist vs.
won't touch video and I said that I
wanted to get it but I talked myself out
of it because I was worried about
falling in love with Tasha products
because they are a more expensive brand
and I'm here to say live why because I
love the majority of these products and
I was like oh no oh no you gon donate
girl now you really like Tasha as well
but what came inside here was this one
is the appear one-step kamila cleansing
oil so this is what I use to take off my
makeup at the end of the night I do
really enjoy this I think it takes off
everything liquid lipstick it glitter my
eyelash adhesive it's taking it all off
the only kind of like downfall I noticed
with this one is that I have to use a
lot I think it says something yeah it
says massage three to five pumps on to
dry face with dry hands for ten seconds
then rinse away I have to use like eight
pumps to make sure I'm getting
everything off my face other than that
it takes everything off this packaging
is also a super nice like it's heavy its
legit this is a really really good if
you love cleansing oils to take off your
makeup which is personally one of my
favorite ways to do it this is a really
nice one another item that is in there
this is the Polish the classic rice
enzyme powder and then the instructions
are mixed with water to create a film
massage on for 15 seconds and then rinse
so it has a little topper here and you
just kind of shake it out into your hand
it looks like a white powder you mix it
with water and then put
onto your face I just see what sit for a
few seconds and it's really interesting
because when I start to massage it onto
my face it's almost like it's a little
chunky a little gritty and as you leave
it there for a few seconds it's like it
melts into your skin and then when I'm
going to rinse it off like it's
completely smooth on my face it's pretty
cool actually I kind of like it taking
this one too this one I'm not a hundred
percent if I would repurchase like I
would repurchase that cleansing oil for
sure but I might have to think about a
little bit but so far I've really been
enjoying it and it just makes me feel
really fancy when I use it bushi next up
is probably my favorite product from
this set and oh I'm just so glad this
one's my favorite because it's super
inexpensive this is the attached a water
cream it's the water cream yeah I've had
this on my loves list for a very long
time but I've never been able to bite
the bullet because it's a $68 cream $68
for the full-size lip I thought we were
friends I thought we were friends girl
uh yeah I really enjoyed this and it's
funny because I know that lebas actually
said that she doesn't like this ass
because she doesn't feel like it's like
moisturizing enough for her I have
pretty normal skin sometimes in the
winter I can deal with a little bit of
dryness but even still right now I have
pretty normal skin so I don't really
need like a big heavy-duty a moisturizer
and I can tell that this one is
definitely lighter it does seem more
water based which would make sense
because it's called the water cream but
it's just a really lightweight
moisturizer but it feels so good on the
skin it almost does a little bit on the
cooling side to me as well this one I
mean I definitely see myself using this
entire product and I will probably want
to repurchase which is just fantastic
because who doesn't want to fall in love
with a $68 cream am i right alright
because I did last up in the scent is
one of the products that I feel like
I've heard the most mentioned from
tatcha besides the water cream and this
is the luminous dewy skin mist so this
is something that you can spray onto
your face before makeup after makeup I
don't think it's necessarily like us
I think spray for your makeup but it
definitely gives you a glow to be honest
I don't
necessarily really love this one I've
been trying it out quite a bit but it's
almost like it's just a little bit like
too too much for me a little bit too on
the dewy side now maybe in the winter I
will like this to give some message to
my skin when it gets super dry here in
Iowa but for right now it's almost like
it's too much I think out of everything
in that set this one is actually my
least favorite which surprised me
because I know a lot of people really do
love this one I'll keep trying it I'll
keep using it and I think in the winter
I'll probably like it a little bit more
next time I want to talk about a new
release from Becca cosmetics this is the
appraised ski glow what a face palette I
really enjoy this palette first of all
the packaging is a super cute the
reflective but reflect it's a little
hard for you too and then inside you
have six different shades and then such
a boss mirror i love the mirrors in the
Becca palettes they are always so good
so inside you have a variety of
different products you have a rose
quartz which is a highlight icicle which
is that highlight and a new highlight to
Becca and then the blush in here is
called winterberry then this one right
here is called blush to copper and it's
also considered a blush I use it as a
highlight personally this next one is
opal which I love I declared my
shattered opal my highlight de-clutter
and so very happy to have it back and
then the bronzer is called bronze bondi
bondi bondi not really sure how I say it
so those are the six shades in here and
I have been having such a good time with
this palette that is a $54 palette I
purchased mine from Ulta when I have a
20% off coupon for prestige brands I was
like yep this is what I'm going for
I mentioned both this and the anasazi
Beverly Hills sugar glow kid and one of
my holiday will I buy it type of videos
and I decided to go with the becca one i
personally enjoy palettes that have a
variety of different products in them
like I like that I'm getting a blush of
bronzer and highlights in here versus
the Anastasio which was only the
highlights this one was more expensive
at 54 versus 40 but I have in no regrets
right now purchasing this one I'm
absolutely in love with it and I've been
wearing it so much I have the bronzer
the blush and then also rose quartz
this highlight all on my face today I
love every single shade in here every
single one and I love when that happens
the two that I was most concerned about
was icicle and then this a blush copper
because I was like that is not gonna be
a blush on me super shimmery a lot of
people were saying use it as a blush
topper and then icicle is a stark white
you know very pearl wise to highlight
I'm like how is that gonna look good on
me mix the two together oh yeah I love
the way that the highlight looks when I
mix those two together I'm actually
wearing the combo of the two in my
holiday giveaway video and I was getting
asked so many questions what highlight
are you wearing what highlight are you
wearing it was icicle and blushed a
copper from this palette I love the
combination rose quartz is turning into
one of my favorite new highlighters it's
a beautiful pinky highlight opal has
been a favorite for such a long time and
then both the blush in the bronzer I
feel like compliment my skin tone really
really well overall I've been so happy
with this palette if you were
considering getting it I'm giving it an
A+ I've been so so happy with it I love
that I can utilize every single shade in
there this is a palette where no one is
left behind very happy with this Becca
palette so next time I want to talk
about NARS I received at the NARS and
Van ray collection I'm not the full
collection but I did receive quite a few
products and a PR package from NARS
which I was I was completely shocked
over it was so like I opened that box
and it was just completely full of
makeup and I was just like you came down
to Christmas I was so so very excited
huge thank you to NARS for sending me
these products I did not keep everything
for myself I just I could not keep that
much makeup for myself so I do have a
two different sets of lip products I
think it's eight lip products in total
plus a gold clutch all in my holiday
giveaway if you are interested in
checking that out but I can review some
of the products that I decided to keep
so a first up I got this is scent of
lipsticks and this set has confused me a
little bit because I know that they came
out with two different sets watching
other people open up their PR and I got
the nude set and other people got the
red set I can only find the red
collection on the support and NARS
website I'm not sure if that means the
news are sold out and then inside we
have four different mini lipsticks in
here and these are the odd days
lipsticks a formula so I will go through
and insert swatches of each one the one
I'm wearing on my lips today actually is
an Arden which I really enjoy and then
this other one which is in Jane I was
wearing this in my wasn't my morphe 35o
to review video I think it was it's a
really beautiful orange and the other
shade in here is a D
I'm also listing them in the order that
they are swatched on my arm when I
insert of those swatch photos and then
the last one in here is called Barbara
so these are all nudes I was so excited
to get the nude collection because I'm
much more of a nude girl than I am I
read like I said I do have Arden on my
lips today and I quite enjoy it like
this formula I think it's a very creamy
it glides on very easily it's also
pretty long-lasting the shine kind of
goes away after a while but the color
will stick around on the lips for quite
some time so I was excited to try it
back out so those are the four mini
lipsticks and that formula I do cry and
enjoy them if Reds are your thing it
could be a good thing to check out but I
was really happy to get the nudes
so two items that I didn't really end up
loving are their velvet eyeliners these
shades are in Nicoya and then also a
Santiago and these are $24 a piece I do
have Nagoya in my waterline
today it's a nice purple this is
definitely my favorite out of the two
like if I had to pick this one is just a
little bit more vibrant a little bit
more pigmented but Santiago when I tried
to use it it just really did not show up
on the waterline and it really didn't
even show up I'm just kind of lining
underneath my lower lash line it really
didn't show up very well at all so for
$24 I definitely would not be able to
recommend these there's a lot of other
butter eyeliners out there both high-end
and more affordable so the eyeliners
didn't really do it for me they also
released a couple different sets of the
triangle collections the triangle blush
lipstick collections so I got mine in
these shades impassioned and then Anna
so impassioned is just a little mini of
blush it's a really beautiful blush
actually I will insert some swatches of
these as well but when I opened it up I
immediately was like without fruity
that's my shade and it does have the
little mirror on it and then anna is
also one of the audacious lipsticks and
it's a really beautiful mauve I almost
wore it today but I decided to go more
of a darker nude route but it's a really
beautiful
off and I do quite like that these are
$24 so this could be something if you
are wanting to try out the blush or the
audacious lipsticks formula you could
get both of them and try them out but I
really enjoyed both of these so next up
I have an eyeshadow duo and this is in
oh boy menthe her nasty monster nasty
not hundred-percent probably don't
saying that right at all but is a little
eye shadow do you have a gold on one end
and a purple on the other this one also
I did not love these are $36 and I would
not be able to recommend them for that
price the gold was okay it did show up
pretty well and it looks nice on the
inner part of the eye but the purple in
here actually really felt flat you might
even be able to tell from the swatch in
here and that was me like trying to
build up the swatch it just does not
translate to the ice very well it looks
really pretty in the pan Purple's are
some of my favorite to wear but this one
a very much lacked in pigment I found
and so I would not be able to recommend
this little set and I also do have a
blush in here and this one is called a
fetish fetish sized fetishized
just another interesting thing this one
is kind of like a hot coral with a
shimmer these are $30 I do like the NARS
blushes I've tried out this one which
this color isn't the best for me
especially right now I think it would
probably look better on a deeper skin
tone or maybe when I have my summer tan
in back in full swing it's a little bit
bright and a little bit too shimmery for
my personal liking but I do like the
NARS blush formula I like the
impassioned blush and I have another
blush that I got for being a vib Rouge
as well I do like the formulas I like
the size of them I think they're really
nice I like that they have a mirror so I
would recommend the NARS blushes if
you're interested in that though next up
I have the highlighter from the
collection and I know a lot of people
were very excited over this highlighter
myself included it is called double take
it definitely gave me a double take when
I opened it so this is what the
highlighter looks like again it's very
very large and you do get a big mirror
in there too I will insert or close
above it and some swatches it has like
some lips on it which i think is very
cool this one is $42 for the highlight
which is definitely very expensive I
mean you are getting a lot of product
you are getting a nice packaging you are
getting a mirror which is all fantastic
so it's really hard $42 I mean I
an entire bucket pallet 454 and got all
those different shades you know that
I'll probably never go through in my
life and unfortunately for me the
highlight fell a little bit short it
still is really pretty and it still
looks nice on the skin but it just takes
me a while to build it up and I guess
I'm just someone who like what I want to
do like two swipes of highlight and be
like BAM there's my highlight this one
doesn't really do that you do have to
use a really dense brush and really pack
it on and suggest something like the
Sigma fl3 for applying this one but it
just didn't give the full impact it
takes me a while I really have to work
to get it off even in the swatch that I
did again I was trying to build it up as
best as I could so you could really see
what the the color looks like and things
like that but I would not be able to
recommend it for $42 I think that's just
too expensive and I think you just have
to work too hard unless you're someone
who likes a lighter highlight and you
think that you would like that then I
would say go for it but if you really
like the pop and highlights I think
you're gonna have to work too hard for
your $42 for this one and then I
realized that when I was doing at my
swatches earlier I did not include this
one so I do apologize for that it's been
sitting on my desk because I've been
using it so much so I didn't have it in
the regular pile of my review pile that
I had going on this is called the Veil
face palette and I really like this one
like I said it was sitting out right
next to me so I can remember to keep
using it I actually really do enjoy this
one we have the Laguna bronzer in here
the loves think blush and then the
surreal highlighter I think the
highlighter in this one is much better
than the double-take one this one is $49
you're getting three different shades
you're getting a mirror you're getting
really nice packaging I will go ahead
and do some swatches here so you can see
what they look like Laguna is a pretty
popular bronzer from NARS and then the
blush is called a lovesick is it really
pretty almost like a like a watermelon
blush I quite liked it actually it's not
too bright on me and then look at that
highlight but it's really really pretty
listen real highlight I recommend this
one over just purchasing the double-take
highlighter I do really enjoy face
pallets if you're someone like me who
you do enjoy the face palettes you want
to try a variety a different product
from nars I think the $49 is worth it
for this palette I've been really
getting a lot of use out of it quite
like this one
they're almost done nearing the end but
next up I have the new eyeshadow palette
from Kat Von D this is the Saint and
Center eyes shadow palette this is the
other item that my friend that lives
sent to me and I'm really glad that she
did because I had talked myself out of
buying this palette I thought it was
just a little bit too overwhelming I
think quite get it
because I don't have that artistic
creativity that a lot of other youtubers
and makeup artists do I'm not a makeup
artist I just enjoy makeup and talking
about it I didn't think I would be able
to really put looks together because
when you look at this I feel like if
you're like me you probably get a little
bit overwhelmed and how it's broken down
is we have the same side over here and
we have the center side over here this
is also a $62 i shadow palette so just
very very pricey you are getting a ton
of different shades and a huge variety
and then obviously the packaging is just
like sick and there are mirrors on both
ends but I have to say I keep reaching
for this palette I am really having no
problems creating looks love that
there's the matte white shade which is
called a met and I go that's like the
first shade I put all over my eyes
a lot of palettes to skip over that we
have our it's kind of like a camel brown
but I use that as my transition that's
what I use as my first shade my crease
shade today you have deeper shades you
have shimmers you have some more
glitters in here not every shadow in
here I will say is an absolute hit I did
use a rapture the other day it had a lot
of Fallout and it basically was more
glittery than anything I was wearing
this palette in my recent wilayat video
and I felt like I made the look work but
rapture definitely got glitter all over
the palette all over my face and it just
wasn't quite as like of an oomph as I
thought it was going to be but I still
like how the looked came out I know that
I use Sacred Heart in there and also
rosary again I should have an Instagram
tutorial up or up soon with that pink
look that I did on my Instagram so I'll
have it linked if it's already up in my
holiday giveaway video I'm also wearing
this palette and I have this Cathedral
all over my lid and I thought it was so
so pretty I love that kind of darker
smokier look there's only a few a few
misses in here these tops you are
more glittery than anything which isn't
totally my style the olive in here which
is called immaculate I used that shade
in my trying it new makeup new holiday
makeup video where I use this palette
and I was obsessed with the olive this
kind of like a lime green over here I'm
not really sure how much I'm going to
use out of that one and then I think it
was crucifix right here that shade is
kind of a bit of a letdown it's it did
swatch well and it doesn't look super
good on the eyes and then baptism also
is just like kind of really lacking but
like this gold that's right over here
this blue is absolutely pop in this teal
is beautiful there's definitely more
hits in here than there is misses but I
just noticed that not every single shade
like totally knocks it out of the park
but the majority of them do I've been
creating a lot of different looks with
it I have really been enjoying it if you
think that you can create beautiful
looks or might you see some shades in
here that are your jam I'm gonna have to
recommend it I really am because I've
been using this way more than I thought
I was going to and the thing with me is
that you know I thought I wasn't going
to be able to create a lot with it but I
still have so many different looks in
here after swatching the shades after
playing around with a few of them on my
eyes now I have so many more looks in
mind that I want to create with this
palette and I'm excited to keep playing
with it so thank you Liv you changed my
mind I really did not expect to get on
with this palette as much as I do but I
have to say that I would recommend that
the Kat Von D's name Center the last
friend I want to talk about is urban
decay i did receive at their heavy metal
holiday collection in PR which i was so
shocked about which was there when i
opened up the box and i just like kind
of lost myself for a minute it was so
crazy but i do have a couple items to
review they did also send me the lip
palette but i'm just not a fan of lip
Ellis's so that one is in my holiday
giveaway as well but I do have the eye
shadow palette which I did put in a
holiday video and I talked to myself out
of it because I said it's an all shimmer
palette I don't really tend to gravitate
towards all shimmer palettes didn't
think I'd be able to get a lot of use
out of it but since they did send it to
me I was able to try it out and now I
can give you my thoughts
it is a $55 eyeshadow palette which is
quite expensive and what you do is you
kind of have to press the one side in
and then it slides out so packaging is
not my favorite but I like how the
layout kinda is more of like the cooler
tones over here and the warmer tones
over here I get it I do like that it has
a mirror I think that's cool but
packaging just a little bit on the
different side so what I have seen with
this palette I've been playing with this
so much I've been trying it so much I
should have the Instagram mega tutorials
up I've worn this in quite a few videos
my eyeshadow palette collection I know
is probably my most recent where I'm
wearing this eyeshadow palette I also
have like a cranberry look at that I did
recently in a video that's what this
palette as well I will say that these
shadows are really really good and if
you love these types of shadows you love
the shimmers then this honestly I think
would be a really good palette you have
scream all over my lid today and then I
also have some Angelfire on my inner
corner as well I will say that I have
been able to create more looks than I
thought I was going to with this because
I'm someone who I I have that thought of
I always have to go in with a matte and
I really don't the first time it that I
use this I think is when I did the
cranberry shade or maybe it was an all
purple shade I've done quite a few looks
with this one both for on camera and off
camera but I like to create a lot of
halo eyes with these shimmer shades and
I feel like it's going really well for
me that way I don't have to use any
matte so that's what I've been doing the
most for this palette and I've actually
been getting more use out of it than I
thought the shades are super super nice
a very pigmented third that it is a very
pretty palette I still don't know if I
would purchase it myself
being that it's fifty five dollars in a
limited edition palette because I like
to have something that is a little bit
more all-inclusive like the Kat Von D
where I do have the choice between match
numbers and glitters but I have to say
if this is your thing this is a really
really nice I shadow palette I would
recommend it if it's something that you
think you would get a lot of use out of
and then also in the collection that
they sent over their heavy metal glitter
liners so they already have these out
but they released a couple of new shades
I think it was six new shades for the
holidays these are $20 a piece of four
glitters I have you
the glitters in the past I had Midnight
Cowboy which came in I Sephora favorite
set and it's a fantastic glitter I have
recommended that one quite a bit is that
gold they did send it to me in this one
but since I already have it that one is
also in my holiday giveaway I do a
couple so watches in the video I have in
the order that I have them watched is a
distortion and then glam rock which is
also what I have the the glitter portion
on my eyes and then ACDC and then also
spandex that is what I show swatched in
there I've been using so many of these
but I feel like I shouldn't keep every
single glitter so I didn't want to
swatch all of them because I feel like I
can give more away but I kind of wanted
to keep all of them because these are
such good glitters I mean I like them to
do this kind of not cut crease but you
know I was kind of like glitter liner
thing that I got going on today I've
done it a couple other times to put it
all over my eyes and looks it's just a
really really nice glitter and it
doesn't burn my eyes it doesn't sting my
eyes I do have problems with that with
some other glitters but these ones are
actually really really good I love all
the different shades in them I think
they are so pretty I haven't found one
yet that I would not be able to
recommend I think that are really cool
so for $20 you could get yourself a
glitter liner if you're interested but
yeah these are also really good one of
my favorites
high-end glitters that I would recommend
