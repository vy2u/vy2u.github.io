video but first if you are new here
welcome my name is Samantha and I post
videos about four to five times a week I
hope that you will hit that subscribe
button to stay up to date on all of the
videos that I post but like I was saying
I'm excited for today's video because
it's a tag and collab video my friend
Natalie from hashtag fab life she
reached out to me and asked if I would
want to do this holiday tag video with
her so basically she's come up with a
handful of like holiday based questions
so I'll go through them and give my
answers I will leave her channel in her
video link down below I really hope that
you will head over to her Channel watch
her video subscribe let her know that I
sent you she is so sweet she has great
videos she's always talking about like
the new releases she has some great
product reviews on there and I just was
so excited that she asked me to do this
video with her so this is our holiday
tag video and I'm also tagging you guys
to do the holiday tag as well the
holiday season is here i have my
christmas tree in my office i'm so
excited about it i was doing some
holiday decorating just last night
actually so why don't we go ahead and
jump into the questions the question one
is favorite holiday lip color and I know
that most people would like choose a red
for this become an you think of holidays
you think of like red lipstick I have
yet to find like that perfect red
lipstick I have tried I have a handful
in my collection but I haven't found a
red lipstick that I'm like this is my
red lipstick you know what I mean I am a
sucker for good nudes I love nudes and
that's typically what I wear like when I
think about going to a holiday party or
we just had Thanksgiving and what I wore
to Thanksgiving it mostly is newts that
tends to be what I think is the most
flattering on me it's nothing to like
over-the-top like sometimes I think red
lips are can just be a little too
over-the-top and especially when we do
so many family things like I like to
look pretty and put together but I'm not
trying to like be super flashy and my
family events that's just me maybe I
mean you could be different that's
totally fine but that's just me
what I'm most comfortable in so some of
my favorite nudes at the moment our bow
and arrow from kat von d candy k from
Kylie cosmetics is one of my favorites
because I think it's super long-lasting
the one is more of like a pink nude and
then truffle tease from Maybelline is
like one of my absolute absolute
favorites it's such a just nice like
creamy glossy lipstick and it's just
super-easy to reapply feels good on the
lips so those are my favorite three nude
lipsticks and I'll leave them linked
down below as well next one is a
favorite holiday movie and I really
think that this has to be elf because
come on man like who doesn't love elf I
mean that movie still I don't even when
that movie come out years ago still to
this day if I see elf on TV I cannot not
watch it I have to watch it I don't want
to change the channel I'll receipt the
lines with it and it doesn't matter
because sometimes elf is on like you
know multiple channels throughout the
holiday season like it doesn't matter if
i just watched elf yesterday if i see it
on TV again today like I'm going to sit
down and watch it too it's just so funny
and puts you in such a good mood and
Will Ferrell in that movie is absolutely
hysterical favorite holiday song this
one is kind of hard for me but I think
it's a Mariah Carey what is it called
all i want for christmas all i want for
christmas my Mariah Carey I'm not going
to sing it because that's that's not how
I roll but i don't know i just always
loved that one he's gonna watch the
mariah carey like special on e i'm
trying to decide if I'm going to she was
like one of my like idols back in the
day and then and then not not as much
but I don't know I still trying to set
up I'm gonna watch that one but I still
I really do love that song so the next
one is favorite holiday traditions so
when I was younger I just loved the
holiday time it so much because we would
always go to my grandmother's house and
everyone on my mom's side of the family
would come it was such a big deal the
kids would draw names like all of the
grandkids we would all like around
Thanksgiving time put our names in a
basket and we would choose a name and
you know that was who like the grandkids
would buy a gift for so I've wrote and
got a gift it was just so much fun I
just always remember like just being
so excited on Christmas Eve it was
always Christmas Eve going to Grandma's
house all of the food all the things
they would be there like the gifts I
would always end up falling asleep at
Grandma's house having like I literally
could remember like falling asleep out
grandma's with all the kids and then
waking up the next day in my bed and
it's Christmas and saying that came and
how exciting it was so that's always
just been such a wonderful memory to
have around the holiday time I just
loved it so much as a kid one of my
favorite traditions now that we have
with my husband's family I don't even
know when those started a couple years
back but my mother-in-law each year on
Christmas or whenever it is that we're
all getting together she will hide a
pickle ornament on the Christmas tree
looks like a pickle and then we have to
find it and whichever of there's six of
us my husband has a brother and sister
and they are both married so it's the
six of us looking for the pickle and
whoever finds it gets like a special
prize I have won several times like I
think I won the first year probably the
second here pretty sure I won last year
I think maybe I've only lost like what
time so I mean if you need like I'll
find the pickle champion it is me so
that's probably why that's one of my
favorite traditions because I don't
really like to lose and I don't lose it
that game and usually there's candy
involved as the price yes next question
is best gift you've ever received so I
didn't I never look at questions
beforehand when i'm doing tag videos so
i'm sitting here thinking best gift ever
received I remember as a younger girl I
don't know how old I would have been
maybe like eight I got one of these like
really cool dolls I wish I could think
of what the name was but it was where
you actually like got a birth
certificate for the doll it was such a
big deal and it was such like a
real-life looking doll it's kind of
creepy actually now that I think of it
but I just remember thinking in the
stall was just such a big deal and you
know that was my baby and how I would
take care of it and I can still remember
to this day like how excited I felt when
I opened it up and I saw the doll and I
saw her birth certificate that meant she
was mine that was always very cool try
think if there's anything like as I've
been older what I
gotten but it's so hard because like as
you get older I feel like you ask for
things that like you need like you're
more practical now and that's always
kind of a bummer but I don't know if I
have like one Christmas gift that like
really made me go crazy except for like
when I was a kid and things like dolls
just just like pushed me over the edge
made me so excited known as ugly
christmas sweater or holiday glam
definitely holiday glam i suck at doing
ugly christmas sweater parties we had
one in college ones and i came in like a
crop top it was red it was red but it
was a crap top and it had like
rhinestones on it or something and
people are like that it's not an ugly
sweater I'm like it has rhinestones so
there you go like that was my version of
an ugly sweater I just don't do ugly
sweater well so holiday Glee I'm
definitely the next question is have you
had a white Christmas I live in Iowa so
yes I've had a white Halloween I've had
a white thanksgiving I've had a white
birthday and my birthday is March 23rd
it just loves to snow the last question
is where will you be when the clock
strikes midnight on New Year's Eve my
guess is at my friend Shannon's house I
think she'd already said that she wants
to host New Year's again that's what we
did last year I can put my little like
family photo that we took on new years
last year because I just thought it was
super cute we just had like a very chill
like pajama party casual no makeup like
had my slippers on it was just like a
really fun relaxing evening just a
couple of other couples and like we
played games and of course I watched the
countdown and all that but that's my
favorite thing to do I don't know if
I've ever been out out on New Year's Eve
I think we've always done something at
someone's house or something more laid
back or chill it just to me it's just
like dangerous being out of New Year's
Eve you don't know people are driving
crazy and I don't know it's just a
little too crazy for me and also like
the cover charges to get in anywhere are
so incredibly high I don't like
a cover to go to a bar than pay for
drinks like that's just not my style I
don't want to do that so I love going to
friend's house and just being around
people that like you love and you want
to be with and then of course being able
to kiss my husband at midnight and have
my dog there with me it's just the best
so yes probably at a friend's house
because that is going to be everything

that you guys will do this one as well
