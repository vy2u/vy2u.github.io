today's video I am so excited to do
because I'm going to be sharing my
review of home chef I know this is a
different video for my channel and you
probably smell all these videos floating
around but I can't even tell you how
excited I am to a to be able to try the
service and be to tell you all of my
thoughts on it and how it worked out for
me so this video is in sponsorship with
home chefs so a huge thank you to them
for allowing me to work with them and to
be able to use their service and then to
be able to give my thoughts to you this
is a service and a review video that
means a lot to me personally if you
can't tell like I'm just very excited to
make this video and share my thoughts on
it because it's something that I've been
wanting to do for the longest time if
you guys do not know I like to call
myself in undomesticated because I am
NOT great at a lot of things that a
domestic goddess should be good at but
that includes the kitchen and that
includes cooking so I have a lot of
different thoughts when it comes to home
chef I'm gonna walk you through the
process of ordering how it was for me
signing up and then share a little bit
about getting my box in the food and all
of that good stuff so I have a lot to
cover in today's video I'm very very
excited to do this one so why don't we
go ahead and jump into it already so
before we get started I do want to let
you guys know that home chef did give me
a coat for $30 off of your first order
if you go ahead and check the
description box you'll see the link
right there if you click on that one you
will be able to get $30 off your first
box which is pretty cool
so honestly it was actually Jen loves
reviews that talked me into home chef I
watched her video I will link it as well
in my description box
I watched her video and I was like okay
I'm going to do this so I decided to
sign up with home chef and then I
actually got approached to do this video
and I was very excited about that
because I had already made up my mind
that I was going with home chef but like
I said that I like to call myself the on
domestic goddess I have never been good
at cooking or just for the anything with
the kitchen it's not my thing it's not
my foray and one of the reasons that I
really wanted to start a meal service
delivery program and why I thought it
would be good to review for you guys
right now is because you know in the
past several months here my personal
my home life has kind of been shifted in
a lot of different ways and it's affect
something as you know simple as the
meals that we have are out our nights at
home and so if you guys don't know what
my husband lost his job in January now I
have been with Mitch for 11 years and he
has always liked to cook it's always
been his thing he loves putting together
recipes he loves being in the kitchen he
loves cooking and that is why our
marriage works
someone feeds me that's fantastic I'm
just kidding but it's such a good thing
because try as I might to love cooking
and to get so invested in Pinterest it's
just not for me I don't have the
patience for it I don't have it's just
it's just it just doesn't bode well for
me okay so mush loss is job in January
he is since working but he works 90
minutes away from our home so instead of
getting home at 5:00 o'clock 5:30 and
making dinner for us some nights he's
not home till 7:00 7:30 even 8 o'clock
so there's a lot of nights where you
know either we're just doing dinner
separately he's having dinner on the
road I'm you know having a bowl of
cereal at home or I'm trying to make
something to have on the table by the
time he gets home I'm because he's
arriving home so late if you follow me
on other platforms such as snapchat and
Twitter and Instagram stories you will
see that a lot of times those meals are
frozen pizzas kraft mac and cheese
because i don't know what i'm doing i
don't know how to cook
I don't like grocery shopping I don't
like any of it none of it's for me um so
since our life at home has switched
recently I'm like there needs to be a
change around here because I can't
continually like crap mac and cheese is
very inexpensive and that's great but we
can't keep eating mac and cheese and
ramen and tuna fish sandwiches at night
like something has to change here and I
need to figure it out I need to somehow
step it up so I can be helping and
that's when I decided to do a meal
service delivery so hopefully that makes
sense hopefully it helps understand why
I'm so excited to do this video because
it is something
that means a lot to me and it's
something that really I think is going
to help us out in the coming months here
as we kind of decide what it is that
we're doing and how we're gonna handle
him working so far away from where we
live I signed up for it and I went
online I was able to you know after you
enter all your information and all that
fun stuff something that I noticed right
off the bat was that it had you put in
your preferences so if you are a
vegetarian if you are on a low-carb diet
you can put that in there so the recipes
that you get will reflect that you can
also you know note if you have any
allergies or if there's any foods that
you don't like anything like that they
have a lot of different options so you
can really customize the recipes that
you're going to get I noticed that right
away and I thought that was pretty
awesome
there's also 17 weekly menu options that
you get to choose from so there's a lot
of different variety of them there they
have you know meats and seafood
obviously the vegetarian options pasta
options they have quick little options
like five-minute lunches in their
smoothies which again if you follow me
you know I love smoothies so they have a
lot of different options and it comes
out to be 995 per serving I will be
honest when I first heard 995 a serving
I thought that's expensive right like I
kind of thought about for a second I'm
like I feel like that seems kind of
pricey and then I started thinking about
it and as much and I would go out to eat
I would look to see how much we were
spending and I mean so we're talking
we're having a $20 meal at home when we
go out to eat I mean if we spend $30
that's pretty inexpensive but most of
the time were more in the 40 50 dollar
range and sometimes I can get even
higher so once I broke it down like that
and really thought about it and what we
spend going out to eat I was like okay
995 is her thing that's not bad also
when you go online you can choose how
many servings you want so if you have a
family if you have more people that you
need to feed you can do it that way or
if you want to order extra servings of
something like if you want to have you
know another meal of that that week or
whatnot you can order in the extra
servings as well you can also choose how
many meals that you want to have
delivered to you I'm we're gonna go back
between two and three and it's just
gonna be a thing where if we're going to
be home a lot we know we
much going on that week we're gonna go
with three males if we know we're going
to be a little bit busier maybe gone you
know here and there throughout the week
then we're gonna do two meals so that's
kind of how we decided to do it for us
but I think that's really cool to have
that that option when you're planning on
ordering also you can choose the day
that you want the food delivered
I chose Friday for myself Monday and
then the weekends are the only days that
they're not delivered but you can choose
Tuesday through Friday but I really
liked how customizable it was to you to
your preferences and to works best for
you so I do have a little clip in here
of me getting my home my chef's box and
opening it up and showing you guys what
it looked like so I'll go ahead and
insert that clip here for you now so I
just got my first box and so I just
opened it up and in my kitchen so it is
a little bit dark so on the top here I
see the recipes and the recipe cards for
each of the meals that I ordered so we
have the Korean pork medallions which I
think I'm going to make first and then
also the hot honey salmon so I'm excited
about these I see everybody with their
binders I feel like I'm well on my way
to be a part of the it crowd yes
okay so then on top here this is what it
looks like and then inside we have our
meals so this here is some ice keeping
everything cool which is great and then
keep digging in here oh it smells really
good
okay so then this is the first bag and
I've been watching people's videos you
know trying to see how it works too and
its really nice that each meal is in
each bag so I don't kind of have to be
fumbling around for you know what it is
that I'm doing in what ingredients that
I need so this is the second bag here
alright and then we have another bag at
the bottom here so that looks like my
meats and then also my salmon excuse you
this food is not for you this is for me
and your father so we did already make
one of our meals and then I wanted to be
able to do this video where I hadn't
make it in the second meal yet so I can
show you how it came so I noticed right
away that the meat and the seafood came
in a separate bag so each of the bags
look like this and then they are also
labeled so you know which meal it is so
this is the Korean pork medallions and
everything in here is already
proportioned out
and just ready for you to cook so you
don't have to deal with any of that you
don't have to grocery shop for anything
extra
I'm just everything that you need is in
this bag and it's really funny when we
were making the salmon one of the steps
was to get the butter out and soften it
and I was like oh no do we have enough
butter for this I didn't like I didn't
even think about grabbing stick butter
and Mitch was like no the butters in
here but it's already there I was like
oh that's pretty cool
so I thought that was pretty nice so
this is just an example of what one of
the bags look like and then again like I
said the meat and the seafood because
they also did order salmon and then also
the the pork these came in separate bags
the one thing that I really like about
how everything is pre proportioned out
for you is a it means I don't have to go
to the grocery store buy things I'm that
person who does my grocery shopping
online because I just hate going the
grocery store I just I don't know
something about it I don't like going I
don't like leaving my house I don't like
parking I don't like any of it so I
often order my groceries online so I
think it's pretty cool that everything
comes to you everything is ready to go
but I didn't realize how much I would
enjoy having things already proportioned
out for me so for example when we were
cooking the salmon you know we had the
exact right amount of butter exact right
amount of time like something as simple
as time but like the one thing that
really stuck out to me was the honey
because I was a hot honey salmon that we
made there was the exact amount of honey
that we would need a lot of times when I
am making food and I am looking at
recipes on Pinterest I decide not to go
with certain items because I think well
it calls for that and we're never gonna
use that again so we are gonna waste
that ingredient why even bother getting
like for example honey I I've never
really seen like these small little
packets of honey like how we had for the
recipe you have to buy like the big jars
or even like little smaller jars but so
that's a lot of honey and I can't think
of any other time we've used honey in
the house so I think that's really nice
and it makes me kind of want to expand
my food range more I'm very picky in
both Mitch and I definitely have a
comfort zone we do a lot of the same
meals over and over and over again which
can become boring and then that's often
when we start going out to eat a lot
which is very pricey
so I just thought that that was really
cool and I kind of opened up new new
recipes for us because it's like well
now we don't have to worry about wasting
ingredients because not only are they
being delivered to us they're being
delivered in their exact proportion to
us so I definitely did want to point
that out
like I said when it does come to serving
sizes you are getting an exact serving
size this can also be something really
good if you kind of watch what you eat
or watch the proportions that you eat a
lot of times when it does come to meals
it can be very hard to only eat what you
need like I'm someone who ovaries if I
just really like something and it's it
it's there you know you go to a
restaurant and you have a huge plate
come out you're like I'm gonna finish it
all because I'm paying for it even
though I'm really full and I don't need
this extra food I'm going to keep eating
it it's a good thing about home chef
that it is you know proportionate
correctly so when we have the salmon and
vegetables the other night we each had
you know a decent size of salmon but it
wasn't anything too much and then we
also had our vegetables as well that the
the zucchini was with that one so I
think that's good at the same time if
you are someone who you typically like
leftovers you like making certain things
pasta or casseroles because you want
those leftovers you're not necessarily
going to get that with home chef for me
it's not a bad thing because Mitch
actually doesn't eat leftovers and I
sometimes can't eat them quickly enough
before they go bad so I did want to
point that out though because I think
it's something that's important I've
been talking about the service with my
girlfriend's a lot and you know giving
my reviews to them and that was one of
the questions that came up that they had
was like how much extra food are you
getting and things like that and so I
did want to go ahead and point that out
as well again it's just another reason
why I'm excited to do this video and I
feel like I'm talking fast because I'm
excited but it's because it's something
that I've been so excited about I've
been talking about to people in my real
life when we were making the meal the
other night I was snapping off my
girlfriend's like oh my gosh I'm doing
this I'm making salmon at home like look
at me when it comes to actually making
the meals so you get this and I remember
I remember Mitchell looking at this
because you know they sent a blank one
there's you know there's a couple like
welcome to home chef pages in here
and he goes I don't really get why they
send this this binder that seems kind of
dumb and then I was like well it's
because you get the recipe cards and you
the recipe cards in the binder he was
like that makes so much more sense and
that's actually really cool it was just
kind of funny so you get the binder that
would come with your first order and
then you do get the recipe cards with
each of your orders that you get so we
ordered the Korean of pork medallions
and then we also ordered the hot honey
salmon which is the meal that we already
made so um one thing that I think is
really important to note is on the
bottom of these cards they have the prep
and cook time which is just good to know
for yourself they have a difficulty
level they also have a spice level which
is important for me because I really
don't like anything with spice and then
it also has a cook within day so when we
were trying to decide which meal to cook
first
the salmon says cook within three days
and the pork medallion is said to cook
within six days so that's why we decided
to go with the salmon to make so that's
something that's also pretty important
to look at it'll also list out what is
in your box and then on the back here is
the actual recipe card and it'll walk
you through step by step and it has
photos in here of what everything should
look like which i think is awesome it'll
say you know what it is that you need so
you can get all your ingredients out
first
it'll have what to do before you cook
such as preheating the oven like with
the salmon getting the butter out to
soften it and then it's just super easy
you know it has the one to three list of
ingredients and so on so we already made
the salmon and again we did that one
together because he was home with
Memorial Day so we made that one
together the majority of these home chef
meals though if we're doing it during
the week I'll be making by myself if we
make them on the weekends he'll probably
be able to make them with me hey it's
nice to do if I am doing it by myself
because especially after doing something
like salmon where I was very intimidated
by it I felt confident and Mitch really
kind of stepped back and he let me do it
and he you know if I had any questions
like how to what was the thing that it
had to do with the time like we had to
seed the time or something like and I
was like I don't know what that means
then stem the time I was like I don't
know what that means and he watches all
those cooking shows so he was like
explaining to me what to do but it
definitely made me feel a lot more
confident so
I have to do it by myself I feel like I
can do it because I feel like everything
was you know well prepared well written
for me and then it also just truly helps
having everything ready to go everything
you know already measured out that will
help me out so much but if we are doing
it together like we were over the
weekend it's just something fun to be
able to do with your partner if you're
able to do that and we just had a good
time in the kitchen and making it the
meal so I appreciate it that about the
cards that you get I was a little bit of
my progress I'm mostly just here to like
review and breakdown the process for you
so I didn't actually record us doing
that and like I said Mitch was also
doing it with me and Mitch images not
joining me on on camera up to this point
so I didn't feel super comfortable
filming that I will put in a photo of
the salmon and the vegetables that we
made I was pretty proud of it but I also
wanted to chat about one thing that I
also really enjoy with it is that
there's no binding contracts to this
because that's kind of the thing that
freaked me out a little bit when I was
first really thinking about getting a
meal service delivery I was like well
you know what if we're just busy what if
we go out of town what if we have a lot
of days where we know we're doing
something after work and we're just
gonna have all this food sitting around
like that just seems to be a waste there
is no binding contracts you can skip any
weeks that you want
when I joined actually I skipped the
first week and went on to the second
week and I am a pretty picky either in a
fairly particular eater there's a lot
things I won't eat and so even though
there are seventeen meal options each
week which i think is really really
awesome I think there's there's a lot in
there to choose from there's still some
times but there's only one meal that's
really calling to me or one thing that I
really want to try so if that happens
for those weeks I know that I can go
ahead and skip over it and it'll be okay
there's also weeks where I kind of
looked ahead on the calendar and there's
been three four options that I want to
do and it's kind of I know it's gonna be
hard to narrow it down so it just kind
of depends with you but you know if you
are traveling if you have a busy week if
you also see items that you just don't
think really will work out for you it's
super simple to skip a week which i
think is great I do want to say if you
do sign up for your first meal you can't
use the skip a meal button on that
on the website if you want to skip over
that week you can simply hit hit that
button and it'll it'll skip right over
that week if it is your first time
signing up you do need to email home
chef and let them know so that is what I
had to do they got back to me less than
24 hours and said no problem we went
ahead and skipped it for you my new is
ready to make the changes when you're
ready for the second week and I was like
okay thank you so I wanted to throw that
in there because that was something that
happened to me but also it's kind of
nice because I was able to contact
customer service and I wasn't contacting
them as a blogger or anything like that
you know I didn't reach out to the gal
who I've been working with for this
video I've used their direct customer
service and said that I needed to make a
change so that was really awesome for me
it was nice to see that I was able to
get help right away and it was
immediately solved so another thing too
I think you can schedule I think it's up
to five weeks out so if you are
traveling or you're a meal planner or
anything like that or you just want to
have your your menus in there and ready
to go you can actually book several
weeks out in advance that you can go
ahead and pick your meals out already
and they do have such a great variety of
meals it has me hasn't been pretty darn
excited though other than that that is
basically it for everything that I want
to say for the video it is everything
that I've experienced so far with you
know placing my order getting my home
chef box creating the first meal and
just kind of my my feedback and
experience so far with it like I said
this is just a review that I'm really
excited for because I think it's gonna
be something that's gonna help me out a
lot in my personal life if you just take
away for a second you know the beauty
blogger and I'm mostly talking about
makeup I'm still a regular old person
over here who eats dinner every night
and you know with it falling on me to be
more responsible for making dinners for
really contributing it that way which
has been different for you know so many
years we've kind of operated a different
way this one had me really excited to
review and to let you guys know my
feedback um you know home chefs they did
send me a credit so I could get to the
first box on them to make this video but
we already how our next order placed in
there you know my credit card
information is now in there with home
chef we are the ones that are paying for
it going forward both very impressed by
it and we're going to continue the
service going forward on our own as well
so would I recommend home chef you know
but
something that you think that you need
and a service that you think that you
enjoy I personally would say yes that I
would recommend this because I'm going
to be using it myself going forward as
well so other than that guys that is
gonna do it for today's video I hope
that you enjoyed it I really really hope
that you found it helpful another big
thank you to home chef for working with
me on this video I've been really
excited about this one and to tell you
guys my thoughts so gets ready for more
cooking snaps and I just saw eyes and
all that fun stuff because now now that
I feel confident and know that I can
review it and you know share my process
with everyone I will be I will be
snapping quite a bit of it because now I
know that my undomesticated was I heard
about to change
but other than that guys I hope that you
did enjoyed this video if you did make
sure to give it a thumbs up I hope that
you'll also consider subscribing before
you go and I'll catch you guys in at
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
