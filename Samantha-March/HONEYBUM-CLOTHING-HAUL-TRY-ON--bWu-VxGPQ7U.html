so excited for today's video I'm going
to be sharing a new clothing haul and at
Tryon video this video is a sponsored by
honey bum and I am so excited to be
working with them because I've been
eyeing them and their clothes for quite
some time now so I'm just a super
thrilled to be able to do a video in
partnership with them so big thing you'd
a honey bum for sponsoring me with this
video I am going to be showing all of
the clothes that I picked out from here
I have some tops bodysuit I have jeans I
have more casual clothes I have a jacket
I tried to pick a variety of different
items so I could give good reviews on
the website and the clothes that they
have in there so if you're interested in
learning a little bit more about honey
bump and then also seen the clothes that
I picked out why don't we go ahead and
get started so honey bum is a fairly
newer company I'm not sure exactly when
they started but they know they are
still a bit newer but they I've been
seeing more and more videos popping up
with honey bum I've been seeing a lot of
people on Instagram tagging them they
have over a million followers on
Instagram which is crazy I really like
their website I thought it was really
easy to get through everything to find
anything their search tool actually
searches for clothes which is fantastic
because not every clothing site does
that they definitely carry a lot of
really trendy pieces and something to
keep in mind with websites like this
that are more boutique like is that
their turnover can be very high so I
always encourage when I do clothing
hauls with websites such as honey bum if
there's something that you want I do
suggest you get it and that's not really
trying to like push things on you or be
like go go go I'm just trying to let you
guys know that they do have turnover
pretty quickly because they're always
bringing in the new trendy pieces which
means the other ones when they're gone
and typically they are gone so if
there's items that you like to see I do
recommend picking them up cuz I've had
that happen to me several times over
where I'm like waiting to get something
and then it's just gone and I was like
no but another thing that I thought was
interesting about honey bum I'm reading
on their Instagram right now which I
will have their website their Instagram
link down below of course all the pieces
and all of that will all be down there
but it says we work with at Planet B to
help preserve the bee community so for
every item that is purchased every order
that is purchased honey boom actually
plants a flowers to help preserve the
bee community and I thought that was
really interesting I definitely wanted
to point that out I just think it's
really awesome to see companies and
especially newer companies
have more of a purpose you know what I'm
saying I just thought that was really
cool so I definitely do want it to be
sure to mention that one also before we
jump into the Tryon portion I did want
to say that they did give me a discount
code as well for 20% off your order if
you are interested the code is just SM a
20 I will leave it here on the screen
and I will also have it in the
description box and I want to mention a
code unless I feel very confident in the
company and I actually want you to try
at the clothing I wouldn't do a
sponsored video if I didn't feel very
strongly about this but I have been so
excited for my pieces you've been seeing
me wearing them already in my past
videos wearing them on my snapchat I've
been very excited too about everything
so I can confidently say that if you
wanted to make a purchase go ahead and
use my code it's not a discount code so
I don't get anything for that it is just
a discount for you guys show you guys
what I got so excited for those Parts I
did pick up a couple of different items
like the same item but in different
colors I am someone who does a lot does
anybody else I am like the same basic
t-shirt in my closet in six different
colors I don't know I don't know what it
is but there's a couple items that I did
that and one is with this a bodysuit and
I was wearing this bodysuit in my latest
of will i buy it video so if it looks
familiar because you were seeing it in
that video so I picked it up in this
really cool kind of like mustard yellow
color and then I also picked it up the
same bodysuit in this green I think this
is a beautiful like especially holiday
color it just reminds me of like the
Christmas green I think it is so
gorgeous this is called the made you
look a bodysuit and it is a $39 so it is
a long-sleeved which i think is great
and then it is a bodysuit but it does
have snaps at the bottom which is
fantastic because body suits without
snaps I will never understand it will
just never understand and at the chest
here it does have four buttons and then
they are a snap closures I will insert
some Tryon clips as well
I ordered mine both in a size small and
I think maybe a medium actually would
have been better I still like the small
and I will still rack the small but if
you have a larger chest or if you don't
if you have a larger chest but you don't
like your cleavage to show a lot I would
say probably a size up but for me it
doesn't bother me I would totally wear
these like on a night out with like
high-waisted jeans or high waist legging
this or something and I would be totally
comfortable with it if you guys don't
know I try to mention in my clothes
cause I usually try to put it in the
intro but I call my style saucy but some
people still don't understand what that
means so my style is cleavage and crop
tops like let's just say that that's
just my personal style so I would still
totally wear these but but if you're
going to like a family event or a
wedding or something like that it might
dip down a little bit too low in the
front but for me I really like it it
just depends on what it is that you're
comfortable with and what your style is
and all of that but other than that I
thought it fit really well everywhere
else like in the arms I thought it fit
well it's definitely very form-fitting
but again that's my personal fashion
style so that's a little bit about the
sizing with the body suits but I love
these I love body suits you saw my last
clothing haul I had a couple body suits
in there to wear them so much I just
feel like they're like staples that's
why I got the same body suit in two
different colors I just feel like
they're like staple pieces for my
personal closet so I was really really
happy with these the next item I got is
actually a cropped sweater and I am
aware he knew when a moment right now
normally I wouldn't wear the items that
I'm showing in a clothing cause I do
like to show them up I also did get it
in another color this one I was wearing
in my Sephora vib sale haul video so if
it looks familiar to us because I was
wearing in that video oh my gosh I love
this color I love the burnt orange I
think it is such a beautiful color we
have a burnt orange bodysuit in my last
clothing haul like you guys can tell my
style my trend what I'm into right now
and I just thought this one was so cute
it is a cropped sweater and then it does
have some distressed detail here it does
have the long sleeves also I like this
one because I just feel like it's like
so comfy and cozy I know it's a crop so
I mean it's not like super long or
anything but the sleeves are long and
just the fit you know it's kind of more
bag here in the front you'll be able to
see that in the in the Tryon clips but
also I'm someone who wears high-waisted
a lot either wear high-waisted jeans all
right we're highway Set leggings and
when you wear high waist it with a crop
that is this long and then also a little
bit baggy it doesn't like I mean you can
still kind of play off the illusion that
it's not a crop until you like raise
your hands or something like that and
then you can kind of tell but I mean if
you wear a high waisted pair with these
I mean in my personal opinion I don't
like that it looks too bad but I love
the sweater but then also the red one
again I just thought it would be like so
festive I don't know I'm totally in the
holiday spirit apparently I just loved
the color of the red - and again they're
just really cozy if the neck is a bit
tight when you actually put it on so one
thing I would say because I was doing my
Tryon Clips I had like the fun bun in
and I went it to put this on and I was
like oh the neck doesn't quite stretch
as well so I would say if you're someone
who does your hair which normally is out
is not me but if you're someone who does
your hair and you're gonna wear these
out I would say put this on and then do
your hair because the neck doesn't
stretch too well but again I got mine in
the small/medium size and I thought it
fit really well it's really comfortable
and I just love both of the colors that
I picked up I just think these are so
cute I will definitely be rocking these
more so again this one is the just what
you need a sweater and it was $38 so the
next piece I got I mean like I'm a hard
pressed to pick a favorite piece because
I have been loving so many of them but
this one might actually be my favorite
and it was not what I was expecting to
fall in love with but it's kind of hard
to show here but this one is called
the Raven wrap top it's $28 I picked
mine up in a size small so it is like
pretty sheer material either wear it
like how I am and the Tryon piece where
I just have it wrapped up as like you
know kind of cropped in the stomach area
or honestly you could wear this like
over you know a tank top or something
you'd almost wear it as kind of like not
quite a blazer but you know you could
wear it as like kind of that style which
I thought was really cool there's a lot
of different ways you can wear it and
because of the ties here at the bottom
you can either tie it up a really tight
like underneath your chest and have more
of a crop top you can tie it a little
bit looser so it's kind of more flowy
around the stomach area I just feel like
there's a lot of different ways that you
can wear this I love the color I love
the fit I thought it was so cute the
sleeves are such a fun detail they're
kind of like these like ruffle sleeves
and they're short-sleeved I'm just like
obsessed with this top I was even
sharing it on my snapchat I think I said
obsessed with this stuff I'm fairly
confident that's what my snap set I just
love it I think it is so cute there's so
many different ways to wear it and you
can just kind of style it to how you see
fit which i think is super cool it for
only $28 I didn't think that was a bad
price at all so this one I'm very
excited for you will definitely be
seeing me wearing this
in upcoming videos and if you follow me
on snapchat you'll probably be seeing me
wear it out I just thought it was so
much fun but the Raven rap top I highly
highly recommend and this one was $28 so
next up I got a two-piece said this one
is called the meet me on the track said
and it is $54 so it comes with this top
here and I mean you can either wear it
as a top you could probably wear it as a
sports bra there's really no there's not
anything to kind of like hold you in
like a sports bra would but otherwise
you could just wear it as a crop top and
then it does have the racerback and it's
black with the white stripes here and
then the matching set of lightness that
came with it these leggings are so
comfortable I had them on before I
started filming and then I did that
whole thing where I was like where are
those pants at I know I just had them on
you know I still have had them on I had
forgotten to take them off with it so
the matching pants are just black and
then they have at the waist here the
matching print with the sports bra they
go all the way down to my ankles and
again they're just super comfy and cozy
the set is $54 which is a little bit
pricey for a two-piece but I do have the
20% off coat if you would be interested
in it is it pretty cute set if you like
matching sets which I do I owned quite a
few if you like those I think it's cute
or even to wear to the gym if you like
matching workout outfits you could
totally rock these but that one is the
me me on the track set the two-piece for
$54 the next piece I have to share I am
so in love with and I had it on the
other night and even my husband was like
that looks good on you I was like thank
you so much
it is an olive bomber jacket I'm so
happy to finally own one of these I have
wanted an olive bomber for such a long
time and I'm so excited to finally have
one and this is a nice like you can tell
the quality is really nice on this one
this is called the don't forget it
bomber and it was $42 which at that
price I don't think it's bad I think
with honey bum it's just kind of like it
just kind of depends on what you want
because something is I'm like oh that's
high price some things I'm like that's
not bad price at all I think it just
kind of depends on what it is that you
want so they do have you know quite a
few options I would just take your time
and look through everything and you know
see what matches your price range and
see what matches your style and
personality because I do not think $42
for the bomber
that price at all the last a Love bomber
I was looking at was $95 so when I saw
this listed at 42 I was like what that's
amazing and again this is really nice a
quality of material I think it looks so
pretty on I did get mine and the size
small I love the sleeves it does zip up
in the front I'm going to be wearing the
crap out of this jacket I am just
absolutely in love with it and again got
the compliment from the husband which
was pretty nice it has some zipper
details over here as well so again this
is the don't forget it - bomber for $42
and then the final item I got is a pair
of jeans I don't wear a denim a ton I
don't buy a ton of denim because I
mostly wear lightens I do work from home
so my you know standard work outfit is
Moga leggings and my workout pants but I
do like to wear it done them out
sometimes and again I wanted to try to
purchase a variety of different products
from the website so I could kind of
review more because I know a lot of
people really love their denim and
especially their distressed denim so
that is kind of why I chose this pair so
this is what it looks like it is a very
very distressed pair of like a light
washed jeans I got mine in a size 3
these are club de Charlotte distressed
high-rise skinny jeans there are 44
dollars which 44 I didn't think was a
bad price either cuz I've known some
people who have told me they've bought
jeans for like over $100 and I'm like I
hope those jeans made you look real good
so $44 I did not think was a bad price
at all and I really wasn't sure I was
going to love them again just not being
a big denim fan not really owning a ton
of distress I think I only have one
other pair had our distress and those
are black and this one is kind of a
light wash which I don't wear a ton of
light wash either but from the first
moment I put them on I was like dang I
do like these and I love the fit of them
I got a size 3 and typically in jeans
I'm either a 1 or a 3 so I kind of went
back and forth I wasn't sure what to do
I decided to go ahead and go with a 3
and I thought that was a perfect choice
because they fit so well on my body and
I am just as super happy like they fit
like a glove
but they're not too tight that they make
me self-conscious I don't find it you
know it's like sometimes in the waist
you can kind of get like they're too big
in the waist
think of the back I didn't find that to
happen at all I wasn't like bulging and
I mean like weird areas or anything
especially being distressed like and
sometimes if the jeans are too tight
with the holes then it can kind of look
a little crazy I didn't find any of that
with these they fit me so well I was
very excited about that
I love high-rise I'm a big high-rise
person and thing is because I do wear a
lot of crop tops so I like the crop in
correlation with the high-rise jeans I
just think that looks the best but I
love the ribs I thought that they were
pretty darn cool especially this one
over here like that pole is no joke I
was really excited about these oh I've
only tried the one pair of the honey
bump jeans but so far I was very very
impressed with them and that kind of
takes a lot for me to be happy about
jeans because I'm not always happy with
them but these ones I was super stoked
about so you'll definitely be catching
me wearing these ones as well again
these were called the Charlotte
distressed high-rise skinny jeans they
were $44 okay so that is everything that
I picked out before my honey bum a try
