today's video is going to be a new
clothing hello I am getting to work with
honey bum again on this clothing haul
try on a style video so they think you'd
have any bum but for sponsoring this
video I have worked with them in the
past and they quickly kind of became one
of my favorite online boutiques to
purchase from I have police orders with
them not only as a blogger to do videos
such as this but I've also purchased on
my own just as me and I've had no
discrepancies at all purchasing as a
customer as well and I just really like
their website they're very trendy
definitely very my style of fashion that
I prefer so I'm really excited that they
asked me to do another video with them
so I have a couple different pieces here
I have like loungewear I have denim
activewear and then if you like going
out outfits as well so I'm going to show
you all of the pieces that I picked out
for this video and insert a little Tryon
clip so you can see me in them also if
you were following along any of my other
social media accounts during my Arizona
birthday vacation you actually probably
saw me and a few of these outfits as
well because I did take some on my trip
with me also I will have honey bumps at
website listed down below I will link
out all the items that I'm showing as
well they did give me a coupon code I've
had it for a while now and whenever I'm
wearing honey bun in my videos I always
leave it down there too but it's SM 20
and you get 20% off your order it's not
an affiliate code for me it's just a
discount code for you guys so that one
is down there and you also do get free
shipping on the website on orders over
$50 so when I place my orders in the
past for myself I always tend to take
advantage of that but they have a lot of
really cute clothing on there and again
it's just very much my style type of
online boutique it had really good
experiences with them they have a really
fast shipping I like that there's the
option of free shipping at $50 so I'm
excited to be making another video with
them but if you'd like to see the pieces
that I picked out from honeyBun why
don't we go ahead and get started so
first up is an item that I actually wore
on my birthday when we were down in
Arizona it is a one-piece this is what
it looks like it's in beige this one is
called the play nice play suit and it is
$44 so it is a one-piece and then you do
have shorts and then it is long-sleeved
and
you can kind of decide how you want to
wear it on the night that I wore it I
just kind of wore it off the shoulder
you can wear it higher you can even wear
it lower on your shoulders whichever you
prefer but I really like this and it was
so funny I was wearing it my husband
came out of the bathroom and he was like
oh I like that like thank you so much
so I just thought that was really cute
when I saw it on the website I'd meet it
was like that would be a cute vacation
outfit so I'm just really excited that I
got to wear it and it was kind of
perfect for that night where it wasn't
chilly at all in Arizona let me say that
but it wasn't like scorching hot so it
was nice to have like the longer sleeves
paired with the shorts and it is kind of
like a thicker material it's not super
heavy but it's definitely you know it's
got some oomph to it so I was plenty
warm the night that we went out for my
birthday I did get a size small I liked
that I didn't think the shorts were too
short which is something that I kind of
worry about I'm not very tall I'm 5 5
but if I didn't have like longer legs
I'd probably be more around like 5 1 5 2
so my legs definitely are what giving me
my height
so sometimes shorts I'm uncomfortable
and I don't necessarily like my legs and
sometimes if shorts are too short I'm
uncomfortable but I thought that these
were a good length so I really do like
this one again this one is of 44 dollars
and one of my favorite pieces I was
really excited about this one and I also
do have a dress here this is one that
was kind of nervous about but I I liked
the color first of all and I like the
detailing up top and I just thought it
was really pretty but it did say that it
was a body con dress so I knew that
going into it and it definitely is is a
bodycon dress if you guys don't know it
it just means it's like super super
tight super super form-fitting to your
body but this is what it looks like so I
really liked all of this detailing at
the top here I thought that was really
cool and I really liked this really
pretty lavender color and it has some
good length on it again it is super
tight so kind of like it can ride up
very easily but if I pull it down it
almost does hit my knees which for me is
a longer style of dress this dress is
called I've been waiting for a dress I
got mine an essay is a small and this
one is I believe those 48 dollars it
does zip up in the back because I film
at home in the afternoon I don't have
anyone here so like help me so I kind of
get it zipped up all the way
when I was doing at the try on clips but
if you can see from the trend that it's
extremely form-fitting I would not
suggest wearing underwear
with this dress because you can see
everything with body con dresses I'm not
new to body con dresses so again I knew
that that that this was going to be the
style of dress so I wouldn't suggest
that but I didn't have any issues with
like the bra I was wearing or anything
so I still really do like this dress I
think it's really pretty on and I do
like it and I just I don't know what it
is about this color that I was enjoying
so much and I like the top as well it
wasn't like too much like for me it was
it was enough but it wasn't like too
much especially with it being so tight
and I try to kind of balance things out
with with my outfit choices but I do
really like this one I think there's
like there's certain occasions that I
would wear a body con dressed like I
wouldn't just wear it anywhere and
they're definitely not the most
comfortable dresses ever but you know
sometimes the things that we do in the
name of fashion but I still did like
this one and I thought it was really
pretty so next up I have a two-piece set
this is actually what I flew down to
Arizona in so if you saw my snap as I
was preparing and getting ready to fly
this is what I was wearing so it comes
with a hoodies it's got the hoodie in
the back and it is a cropped hoodie it
is long sleeves and this is really cute
mauve pink color and then it also comes
with a matching pair of pants that look
like this they do have a drawstring and
then a stripe on the edge and my twin it
was like kind of cropped on my ankles it
didn't go all the way but it wasn't like
Capri style or anything like that and
again just a really comfortable said
this is called the oops I did it again
set it's $59 and I got mine in a size
small I thought everything fit me really
well I thought the pants were really
comfortable again I flew in them it was
like a three it was a three hour flight
yeah just I think it was just about
three hours down to Arizona and this is
what I wore I thought it was super
comfortable but I love this top I've
actually already worn it in a YouTube
video this was might be my favorite
thing that I got I just I don't know I
think it's so cute I loved crop hoodies
I just think that they're really cute on
I love this color so much and it's
really comfortable this next item is the
one that was
that like expectations at versus reality
and it's the only one it's the only one
I think ever from honey vomit that I've
ordered that I'm like ooh that one it
was a miss for me and I maybe should
have known that going into it because
it's not something it's a pair of pants
that I probably wouldn't wear out a ton
but they just looked so unique and
different to me and so good on the model
and the picture that I was like I want
to try those out that are kind of cool
and unfortunately these ones really
don't work out for me so these are a
pair of white pants and they have this
like cool lace up detail on the side
here I thought it was really interesting
they do is zip up in the back here and
then they are extremely extremely high
waisted I got mine in a size small it's
called the rushes in pants and there are
32 dollars I got mine in as small and
they're extremely long but also
extremely high I can pull them up
farther than like my bra line so I don't
they just fit kind of awkward on me and
I honestly I'm not sure even if I got a
size smaller I don't know if that really
would have done anything and I don't
know if they carry an extra small on
this but this is one that it just didn't
look it just didn't look the best on me
which I'm super bummed about I took
these are ones that leave it I kind of
took a chance on I was like I don't
normally see myself in this style but it
just looked just different and almost
kind of like edgier maybe I don't know I
was into it but unfortunately this one
it didn't work out for me so
unfortunately these ones this ones are a
no-go for me but I don't you know so I'm
sure some people can pull them off I I
just I am NOT one that can pull them off
they get a pair of denim I have two
other pairs of denim from honey bum and
I really really enjoyed both of them if
you saw the latest concert that I went
to I wore a pair of like super super
distressed jeans they were from honey
bum and I love them and I wanted to get
another pair of it distressed jeans
these ones are called battaglia
distressed as skinny jean so these are
what they look like and they are pretty
destroyed like all along the side here
which I just thought was pretty cool and
different from my other kind of like
distressed jeans that I have
I did get mine in a size one I have my
other jeans from honey bum in a size
and I'm typically anywhere from like a
zero to a three most of my pant sizes
are a two so sometimes I struggle
between a one and A three again I'm not
super super tall and the three said I
have they fit pretty good in the waist
but they are kind of long on me and so
and then just do a little bit of like
that gap in the back so when I went to
place this I decided I would get a 1/2 C
kind of a the difference and you know is
that something I'll just have to deal
with with the 3s being too long well the
ones be too small in the waist I wasn't
sure but these actually the perfectly on
me which I'm super excited about so now
I know if you're kind of in between
sizes for a honey bum I would say maybe
go down because they do have really
stretchy waist bands which is really
nice but these fit me so well I was
really happy with it I don't have that
gap in the waist and the length is
perfect before me so again I'm 5 5 but I
really really like these I'm super
excited about these and I love all the
distressed work and again these were $34
which I don't think is bad I'm not
someone who wears jeans a ton I work
from home and I like live in leggings so
I'm not someone who can spend a ton of
money on jeans so in the 30 dollar range
I think that one is pretty good but
these Italia distressed jeans are
another favorite from all the items that
I got and the last pieces that I got
it's another two-piece but the first
two-piece that I showed it comes in the
set and these you can order separately
so I got a pair of leggings and then a
matching sports bra now the leggings
this is just called the honey bum
legging I got mine in pink in a size
small and they're $24 so this is what
they look like I really liked this pink
color I thought it's like a cool neon
pink and it says honey bum along the
waistline unfortunately these are
another ones that didn't quite work out
for me if you get these I would say
order up because they really have no
stretch to them like the the waist band
has stretch to them but like nothing
else on here has stretched to them so it
was kind of uncomfortable on they're not
super high waisted and I wish that they
were cuz I just kind of prefer high
waisted especially for leggings or like
I wear a lot of crop tops so I prefer
high waisted and these were not but
these were not super comfortable I love
how they look on though and I love the
color I think it's so cool but yeah I
would say if you are interested in these
I would say
sighs up because they really don't have
a lot of room for stretch and then the
sports bra was actually what I was not
sure would work for me and I ended up
liking it more than I did the leggings
so again this is just called the honey
bun sports bra got mine in a size small
and it's $16 so this is what it looks
like and I was just worried that you
know because it doesn't have and I was
like are they gonna stay in are they
gonna like can I workout in this but it
actually holds everything in place a lot
better than I expected it to and I like
the straps on here I like that it's just
kind of something different from my
other sports bras and you can also
tighten it or loosen it as you see fit
and the only thing that I will say about
it is that it's actually fairly small
like it doesn't have necessarily like
cups to it but it's kind of smaller in
this area and if you do have a larger
chest which I am a 32d you can kind of
spill out a little bit over at the top
of it so actually I think a medium would
work better for me I just I wasn't sure
because I'm smaller around that
sometimes it's sometimes buying bras and
sports bras can be difficult for me but
I actually did like this one more than I
thought I don't think this would be a
great bra for like running or a lot of
like cardio in but for yoga or you know
a lower key workout I wouldn't have a
problem working out in this one because
it actually did hold them in place
better than I thought that they would so
out of the asset that I got again
because you can order these separately I
would recommend the sports bra over the
leggings but after that those are other
pieces of that I picked out this time
from the honey bun website so that is
everything a for my latest honey bum
haul in Tryon video I hope that you
enjoyed seeing some of the pieces that I
picked out from honey bum again it's a
site that I order from myself if you
have a style similar to mine I think
that you would really like the honey bun
website so again they will be listed
down below I'll have my coupon code SM
at 20 down there in case you're
interested in making a purchase let me
know what you thought of all the pieces
that I picked out were there any of that
caught your attention or have you made a
purchase from honey bum in the past I
would love to know your experience as
well and I always think it's really nice
to know if you have so other people read
in the comments can know as well so if
you have place in order I would love to
hear that down below but other than that
