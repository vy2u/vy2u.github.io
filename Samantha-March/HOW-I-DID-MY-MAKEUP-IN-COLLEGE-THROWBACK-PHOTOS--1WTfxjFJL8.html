today's video I'm finally going to take
on a popular challenge makeup challenge
that has been going around so I'm going
to be doing the how I did my makeup in
college video so really it seems like
the one that spend the most popular and
the most done is how I did my makeup in
high school and the reason why I didn't
do that video was because honestly I
don't really remember the makeup that I
did in high schools used whatever my mom
had in the bathroom if I ever felt like
doing my makeup the only times I really
did my makeup in high school was like on
game days because I was a cheerleader
all four years so we had games or if we
have like tournaments then you know all
the cheerleaders would mean we do each
other's like hair and makeup but that's
really the only time that i did--like i
was not big into makeup in high school
because when i would try it like I could
just remember like constantly failing or
like always getting made fun of by
usually my older sister like always
making fun of me like when I did like
blue eyeshadow or something and she tell
me I look stupid so I'm like okay well
I'm not gonna do that anymore so I just
can't remember I've tried looking
through photos and I'm like I don't feel
like I'd be a very good video would
probably be really short and like I put
some powder on my face and maybe some
mascara we'd be done and so I've been
watching other videos and like some
people are even doing like middle school
and high school and college I've seen a
very few colleges but I'm like you know
what I want to do this because I think
it's a lot of fun to watch and it's kind
of fun to like see the different
mistakes / techniques that we used to
use back in the day so I thought this
could still be a fun challenge so I
thought why not do how I did my makeup
of college I feel like I can remember it
for the most part but what I can mostly
remember is like the such silly things
that I did that I like cannot wait to
show you guys that this is what I
thought I was supposed to do back in the
day like how did my husband asked me on
a date I don't know that answer but i'm
going to show you guys i'm excited i
don't have all of the makeup products
that i used but some of them like aren't
around or I you know just can't find
them anymore pick the items
from my collection that I feel like are
the closest to what I remember having
type of thing so that's how what we're
going to do it but if you would like to
see how I did my makeup in college
please keep watching I'm just going to
put my hair back a real quick I will
also try to include like any photo so
that I can find from back in the day
that I like make me feel like show off
my makeup I don't know if there will
really be a lot like that but any photos
that i can find i'll continue to share
it throughout this video so if you guys
watched the video that i did about my
husband as i get ready with me at story
time about me and my husband and all
that i talked a little bit about like
our time in college I went to a private
college in des moines iowa for business
and that's what i graduated with my
bachelor's in i have my degree in
business and leadership and honestly
like I had an absolute blast in college
like I know they say like high school
was supposed to be your best years and I
completely disagree with that like
honestly high school to me especially
when I was thinking about this makeup
challenge like it's just not memorable
college was just so much fun I met you
know some of my closest friends that I'm
still friends with now I met my husband
there I just had an absolute blast I
would not change my college experience
for anything I wish I could go back
sometimes but not to do the makeup then
I'm about to show you so one thing that
i bought in college that I just thought
was so cool I can remember going to my
job at the hospital I worked at a VA
hospital while in college and after
college and I remember coming in to the
office one day and like telling my
friend in the office I was like I bought
a new foundation I'm so excited so this
is what I bought is from all my and it's
their smart shade smart balance so
technically I do not believe this is a
foundation it says its skin bouncing
makeup it's more like a BB cream to me
like if I had to classify it it would be
like a BB cream so right i sit down in
the opposite like i'm so excited i'm
going to make it with me like I'm gonna
do big things I went ahead and put some
on my hand and this is what it came out
like if you can see that it's like white
and I was like um i think i bought the
wrong she
aid or I bought the wrong something like
something is wrong here and my friend
was like no you just got to put it on
your face and then when you blend it in
its supposed to like match your skin I'm
like how do you know that like teach me
your ways I don't understand how did I
not know that like that's such a memory
that sticks out to me was literally
putting that on my hand at being like
why is it white but then it is when you
blend it in its supposed to match your
skin pretty well and I think it is a
pretty good job honestly I used this all
my foundation pretty frequently anyways
like I've gone through so many different
bottles of it because I really do like
it I really like this in the Maybelline
Dream fresh BB cream both of them I love
and yes I used my hands back in college
I think you're maybe gonna see one
makeup brush in this entire video so get
ready so then after that what i would do
is i would conceal my under eyes because
like obviously that's what everyone
would talk about was concealer i'm
pretty sure this is the first concealer
that i ever bought is the Maybelline
instant age rewind like I can't even
remember like the doctors and the nurses
in the office like talk about this
whenever we would like chat about makeup
so I'm pretty sure I'm not a hundred
percent which I'm pretty sure this is
like the first concealer that I ever
bought but I didn't really understand it
and what I want you guys to know is that
I honestly did not know how to do makeup
until like two years ago like probably
about one year before getting on YouTube
is when I was like you know what no like
I need a figure make about I need to be
able to do this because it's something
I've always been so interested in and I
always bottle this makeup and then I
have no idea what to do with it I didn't
know how to apply it I was a hot mess so
I got on YouTube to learn and then
through learning I was like you know
what I can do this too or I can tell
other people that it doesn't matter if
you don't know how to do it now like
keep trying keep practicing keep
watching keep learning you can do it so
I just want to point that out that in
college I had no idea what the heck I
was doing so I would take my instant age
rewind and I was put like the tiniest
bit like right in the corners of my eyes
that's why I put the concealer and then
I would take it and come
were like any other marks because you
know I didn't have a full coverage
foundation on obviously I just had my BB
cream on so that's what I would do and
then i would take my finger and blend it
out because the more fiji to was not
available back then so i would take my
finger and blend it out and honestly I
really don't know if this did anything
for me back in the day because I
remember using such like a teeny tiny
amount that look as I'm blending it up
now I'm like how in the world does this
actually do anything for me okay so
after we've made this big transformation
on my face the next thing I would do is
like probably one of my favorite parts
to share with you guys but the next
thing we would do is bronze and I really
loved bronzer so the bronzer I'm going
to use is the NYX bronzer because once
again i'm pretty sure this is the first
bronzer that I've ever bought it's just
the NYX matte bronzer in medium because
of course I want to pick like a light
shade came to my bronzer back in college
like I went hard like either you go big
or you go home right so I'm gonna take I
think I lied i think i have two brushes
that you'll see in here but i'm just
going to take a bh brush I don't even
remember what brush that I used to apply
this or what in the world that i did but
for bronzer here we go this is what i
did load my brush up with bronzer and
then i would apply it all over my face
oh very just to make sure so make sure
we get nice and bronze oh my someone
told me like hey you're only supposed to
put bronzer in like the areas where the
Sun hits you and I'm like but the Sun
hits my whole face so I'm still doing it
right right the side that's not the
right thing that you're supposed to do
oh yeah so I don't know I just treated
bronzer like like I was sending my
foundation or something I don't I don't
like how did people I think oh I like
this I'm the worst brands back
I oh my goodness gracious this is kind
of killing me like I mean does he
Perkins like you think you have a
bronzer helmet like mm-hmm I feel like I
took a bronzer helmet to a new level I
had a bronzer helmet before anyone even
knew what a bronzer helmet was I don't
know why I gives us with bronzer but I
mean I don't know if it is because I was
like obsessed with being pan because
when I was in its the crazy I feel like
started in high school but also in
college oh and yeah like I didn't do my
neck either no no no no why would you
put bronzer on your neck it only goes on
your face all over your face obviously
but tanning was a huge huge obsession
like I said I remember it started in
high school because that's kind of when
the tanning beds started coming out in
the tanning salon start coming out and
like it was so crazy I I can literally
remember the very first time that
it--and I can remember going with my mom
and going with my sister and lying in a
bed for 10 minutes and getting a tan and
thinking this is the best invention of
life how have we waited so long to get
tanning beds and it--and and it--and and
I went to college one of the very first
things I did was get a tanning
membership me and all the girls like we
would all carpool to the tanning salon
and tan for 15 and 20 minutes and like I
look back and I'm horrified do not go to
tanning beds please like I'm horrified
what I did to my skin like oh man I
can't believe I did that but I mean back
then when they first came out there
really wasn't any like hey this is
actually really bad for you and I was
like oh let me just send this tanning
bed and get tan like this is the best
thing ever and so looking good right
looking good it gets better we are
sufficiently bronzed better runs our
helmet on then i would put some blush on
and I lied to you again I've three
brushes I don't know I'm going to stop
counting how many makeup brushes i have
because it's more than one I look
ridiculous how did I leave the house
like this how did I leave my apartment
so then I are going with blush and I
can't remember exactly which blush but I
believe it will say go cover
all single because that's what my mom
always had so that's like what I wanted
to get to is just like the one little
cover girl blush but I remember I would
always go for like the super super
lightest shade so that you could barely
see any blush on me and I mean it's
probably because I had so much bronzer
on that can't really see my watch
anyways but the blush that I chose is
from benefit and this is the dandelion
blush it says sweep this ballerina pink
face powder on cheeks as a soft blusher
all over face as a brightening finishing
powder so that's like how light it is if
you can see it in here and this is
exactly like what I went for back in the
day so it just comes with its own little
brush so just going to like casually
sweep a very small amount under the
cheeks cuz like I don't want you to see
too much blush because I'd rather you
see the brownsburg cuz that was my that
was my life also for brows yeah no no I
know I didn't do browse and actually in
college and this actually started in
high school to my thing was to wax my
eyebrows as frequently as i could and
basically just wax them off i really
hope that i can find some photos that i
can insert in here for you because i had
the thinnest thinnest little eyebrows
and i don't know why i can recall one
time being at my friend's house and she
was like my mom's gonna wax my eyebrows
she just got like a wax pot and I was
like I want her to wax my eyebrows too
because I always had like my eyebrows
were thicker than this back in the day I
actually started waxing my eyebrows when
I was 14 years old my mom was like I
think we need to get your eyebrows waxed
because I'd like sometimes like a
unibrow thing could be happening I don't
know it was crazy my mother introduced
me to eyebrow waxing thank you so much
mother cuz I needed it but I remember
being at my friend's house and she's
like my mom's gonna do my eyebrows and I
was like we haven't do mine to like
that'd be so awesome and I didn't even
say anything to her mom like this is how
i do it or this is what I want are like
just clean them up type of thing and she
whacks like half my eyebrow off and four
summers and I can recall looking in the
mirror and being like I look amazing
like look at my face I had to find my
faces you can see all my features why I
don't know and I continue to wax my
eyebrows that thin through
pretty sure it's through college like
maybe after college or toward the end of
college just when I was like actually I
don't want my eyebrows to look like
little snakes on my head anymore so I'm
going to do something a little different
and I let him grow out and now I do wax
them mostly just to clean them up type
of thing I don't actually like wax have
my brows off like I used to but I didn't
do any sort of like product with them
because obviously I'm trying to get rid
of my eyebrows now we're trying to like
make ourselves out full or eyebrows so
no brows will be done in this video okay
so this is this is my face this is my
face look ah awesome so I'm going to
move on to my eyes and I don't have the
exact I shadow that I use literally
every single day in college when I found
like a pretty good match for it but what
I used was again another cover girl
single and my mom must use like a
tonneau cover girl because that's like
when I gravitated towards when I started
by my own makeup but as a covergirl
single and I think this is actually a
pretty good color match for it this is
the Loreal infallible eyeshadow and iced
latte this is what it looks like and
it's really like one of my favorite
eyeshadows I love it but it reminds me
so much of that cover girl 1 this is
what it looks like on the inside just a
really pretty like soft champagne type
of colors i'm just going to use a bh
brush and all i would do I mean I
literally I used one eye shadow and the
brush that I used is the brush that came
in like a little like sponge looking
brushes or whatever that's what i would
use and I would just sweep this all
along my eyes again this was it this is
my only eyeshadow I did I didn't even
know what a transition color was crease
color like what what's that no blending
brush never heard of it remember getting
ready for my friend's wedding and she
got married fairly close to us like
still being in college and like I feel
like this is the makeup look I did like
minus the bronzer I'm not sure when I
got it through my head that my bronzer
was to not look like this I will say
before I actually learned how to do
makeup it took me a lot less time
my eyes that's for sure so after my
eyeshadow was done I would come in with
my eyeliner and this is the eyeliner
that I used in college is one of the
very first eyeliners I ever bought I
still love it I still use it to this day
still one of my favs but this is my
exact combo that I did on my eyes this
is the Maybelline unstoppable eyeliner
and sapphire so it's a really pretty
blue eyeliner so what I would do with
this eyeliner is I would start on my
plate outer part of my eye and I would
only draw a half way in I wouldn't come
all the way to the inner part of my eye
reason being is that I saw I like read
in a magazine once that said if you feel
like you're eyes are smaller then you're
only supposed to take your eyeliner
halfway in because it'll make your eyes
look bigger where if you take it all the
way into the inner part of your eyes it
can make your eyes look more closed and
I went with that I went with that for
several years and now I'm like no but
that's what I'm going to do right now so
I'd start at the outer part bring it in
about half way well I feel like I went a
little more than halfway my bad and then
I would kind of take the outer and like
do some weird flick thing not not make a
wing I would just like just like flick
it I don't even know I don't I don't
know what that was supposed to
accomplish but that's what I did I did
the same thing on the other I you guys
want to hear what I thought was the best
part about this I makeup look it's
probably because I didn't use any
eyeshadow primer so these colors would
kind of smudge together like by the end
of the night especially because like in
college we did so much like dancing like
you know sweating by the end of the
night that my eyeliner would start to
mix in with the eyeshadow and I thought
it made a really cool color and I was
like I have discovered something pretty
amazing like I thought that was so cool
when that would happen when in reality
like my eye makeup was just smudging but
I thought it was awesome you guys been
telling you this is kind of embarrassing
to film and share all of this with you
guys but you know what don't judge me
okay don't judge me I've been watching
these other videos to like some people
made some really funny
thanks out there okay then what I would
do next is I would take the same
eyeliner pen and I would put that on my
lower lash line I would not put it in my
waterline I did not start doing
waterline eyeliner I know I was out of
college but so I'm not going to put it
in my waterline which is gonna be really
hard for me but I just put it on my
lower lash line again halfway only
halfway because you don't want your eyes
look too closed right only halfway go
ahead and draw it underneath the lash
line till we get about halfway oh my god
i really did i make up like this oh so
that's all I make them look like I'm
gonna cry is this is ridiculous and now
I'm gonna do the same thing on the other
eye Oh on the lower lash living don't go
with the waterline only go halfway I
have glitter fallout all around my eyes
all around my eyes so got halfway ok
here is let me zoom un I'm gonna swim
you in so you can see the beauty that I
have going on here so this is what my
eye makeup look like in college but I
mean we're not done yet hello we're not
done yet but just so you guys can see a
close up of how gorgeous my eye makeup
was in college this is it there with you
guys what I did for lashes like I'm
really excited to share this part so
when I first started college I wasn't
totally on the fall / trend yet I mostly
did mascara and what I had was like the
double-ended mascara believe us from
Maybelline and it came in like a blue
packaging but it would have liked the
white eyelash primer on one end and then
the black regular mascara on the other
end I thought it was so cool like I
thought it was awesome I used it every
single day no matter what I would always
put the white on first and then the
black I just thought it was super cool
he probably like towards my second year
maybe even even that early on because I
can remember being in the honor storm
and gluing false eyelashes on that was
my second year of college so I started
getting more into false lashes I
absolutely loved him and then I started
to kind of be known as like the girl who
wore false eyelashes
because nobody else would and even
though i did not know how to do makeup I
did not know how to do eyelashes and you
will see that very soon I was like I
don't care this is what I want to do
I've always wanted a big beautiful
eyelashes and I'm not going to get them
naturally so I'm gonna buy false lashes
and I'm just gonna own it and I did I
owned it but let me show you how I
applied them so i feel like you guys are
thinking like how did she apply her
eyelashes like why would this be such a
big deal like how can you not apply
false eyelashes well well i will show
you so i have a new pair of our doll
lashes here there's our their glamour
they look like glamour what's these to
me even though it doesn't say wispies on
it but it looks like the wispy so i got
this new pack here that i wanted to save
before this video once i decided to do
it because i would take my eyelashes and
i would take my duo eyelash adhesive
when I first started eyelashes I only
did white adhesive because that was like
all that I knew and looking back I'm
like oh my word how did i do that i only
use dark toned eyelash adhesive now and
i highly recommend that for anybody like
just stay away from white adhesive it's
not going to do you any favors and i
would take the eyelash right from the
little little jiggy there i'd put my
white adhesive on it and i would put it
on to my eye I would not cut my lashes
do you see how long these lashes are
these lashes are not going to fit on my
eyes but I did not care I did it anyways
I would have an eyelash on my I am
scared because these even muwah these
look really long oh my word but you know
what I'm gonna do it I'm gonna I'm gonna
put my adhesive on was one thing that I
actually did know was like after I put
the lash adhesive bond like I knew to
let it sit and get tacky thankfully
especially with white adhesive like you
could really mess things up if you just
went right in with it but I will be back
to show you what this looks like because
it's going to be fantastic oh my word so
after the adhesive has had some time to
dry I would put it on my lash not with
tweezers not with anything like that I
didn't even know that you can use
tweezers for eyelashes I didn't know you
were supposed to cut the aisle
ashes oh just go ahead and pop them on
so it's really hard to do with my
fingernails this is how I always used to
do am I now I'm local can't do it it's
not like comfortable and the slightest
like the inner part is driving me insane
but you know what I only have to wear
this for a few minutes so it's ok ok so
i got my adhesive on my other lash i'm
gonna let that dry for a few minutes but
as we're winding down this video i just
want to say that i really hope that you
guys enjoyed this like I hope you found
this video fun I honestly did not expect
that I would laugh as much as I did
throughout this video but sometimes like
just looking at the view finder and
seeing my face I'm looking in the mirror
I'm like what in the world was I
thinking like I feel like maybe the
makeup wouldn't be that bad if I didn't
go super crazy on the bronzer and again
I don't know if it's just because I
wanted to be tan so much that that's why
I went so crazy with the bronzer but
like I'm glad that it was probably once
again my second year of college I feel
like my second year of college I really
started to not figure things out I'm not
gonna say I started to figure things out
but I started to slowly show
improvements and slowly but surely I
started to see some improvements nothing
crazy nothing life-changing yet like
that didn't come until like I said two
years ago and i graduated from college
in 2009 so that gives you any clues
there but this is actually a lot of fun
to do i thought about not doing it just
because these videos have been going on
for so long i'm like is that anyone even
want to watch them anymore but like to
me it's hysterical to see him so i
thought why not why not give you a
little glimpse into my life this eyelash
is driving me insane how did i go out
all night with an eyelash right in my
inner corner of my eye oh my word oh oh
oh see I go to put my eyelash on like
where I'd normally put my eyelash on
that's how much I had to cut off that's
that's a lot to cut off so let me go
ahead and move that on down ash was the
blush was a bit harder to get on that
was those a bit more challenging
do you guys see like how much my lash
that I should have been cutting off like
oh man and I honestly like I can
remember finding the dark tone adhesive
like I think I was reading a magazine
once and it said because you know back
in the day you read magazines and it
suggested using the dark tone and so I
went out and bought it and I was like
this is literally changed my whole life
like my whole life got changed you guys
my whole life ok so our lashes are on
we're looking beautiful and then I just
finished it up with my lip off my
gorgeous makeup look I would do my lips
and back in the day I really didn't do
lipstick or lip colors because I mean I
already have these fabulous lashes in
this bronze it's up skin like why would
I want my lips to take away from them so
what I would use was the Maybelline Baby
Lips just like a clear or maybe
sometimes just a little bit of a tinted
lip balm I don't have any the baby lips
but right now i'm using the covergirl Oh
sugar and candy and that seems to be
like the most similar to me because this
is like literally just like a clear lip
balm so I would just apply it like so
and then my makeup look is complete what
do you guys think maybe don't tell it
like you don't have to tell me honestly
what you think though cuz that might
really hurt my feelings but that is
going to be it for how I did my makeup
in college I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this video or found it funny or
got a good laugh because I laughed
really hard doing this video I'm glad
that I made the decision to film it
because this actually was a lot a lot of
fun if you have not filmed a how I used
to do my makeup challenge type of video
i really suggest that you do because it
was kind of fun to think back and
actually think of how i used to leave my
apartment and go to parties and go in
public and it's amazing it's so funny to
think of like how you transition because
even like I said like this is what i did
my first year of college and the second
year I started to get a little bit
better who a period of my life are like
I lost so much confidence in myself and
like in everything that I was doing and
I basically just stayed away from make
up completely like is just it just
happened
and then I was able to get back into it
and get my confidence back and really
just find the fun and make up you know
makeup doesn't have to be such a serious
thing it can be fun and it can be an
outlet for creativity and that's what i
have found with it so it's just really
it fun to see the transition throughout
the year so i hope that you guys i
really enjoyed this video if you did
