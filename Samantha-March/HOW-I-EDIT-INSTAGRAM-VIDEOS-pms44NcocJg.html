today's video is going to be how I edit
my videos for Instagram this has been a
really requested video so I'm going to
walk you through what I do and how I
edit my videos so we're looking at my
editing software which is wondershare
filmora I'll leave it linked down below
the first thing that I do is add in my
video clip but this is just me doing a
face makeup drag it on to the timeline
and then I will go ahead and right-click
it and mute the video that way any
background noise will not be heard my
dog barking me talking anything like
that
I also do add in my own music overtop
that even if you add in your own music
you would still be able to hear the
background noise so I think that's
really important and then I just go
through and cut and trim the video
there's this little scissor tool right
there that you use to cut the video and
like you see I just made that cut then I
will go through I'll let the footage
play until I get to the next area that I
want to cut and then I will remove all
the middle section so what you're seeing
right now watch should be cut out for
the Instagram video so when the
foundation starts to pour out I go ahead
pause it cut it and then right click and
delete that metal footage so you're only
seeing you know obviously the most
important clips in the video this is how
I edit for my YouTube videos as well so
it's just super similar obviously
Instagram videos can only be a minute
long even if they are a minute and a
second you have to trim out that second
so but this is the same editing software
that I use for YouTube as well I do post
an Instagram video every day and I've
gotten just so many requests coming in
of being able to film how I edit for
Instagram so this is what I'm walking
you through if there's any specific
questions please do leave them in the
comments below and I'm happy to answer
them but this is the editing program
that I use it does have a cost to it I
think it's like $60 per year for it I
believe but again it'll be linked in the
description box below but I find it
really user friendly I don't have a Mac
and Final Cut pearl was a little bit too
confusing for me so if you're a little
bit more of a newbie like me I like to
this program a lot more there's also
these really nice features up here like
transitions I use
transitions a lot in YouTube videos but
I also like to use the fade in Instagram
videos you just drag it onto the
timeline in between the two clips that
you'd want to transition between usually
I do like my final makeup application
which is usually a lip stick and then
the last Clips where I'm actually like
showing off all the makeup I'll do the
fade in between them and I like the
effect that it gives you can also do
text which I use that mostly in YouTube
videos I will put like a text in the
intro saying what the video is I also
really suggest using a watermark for
Instagram videos I made mine in
PicMonkey you just do a transparent
background and then I put my Instagram
handle in it and then I will add these
to the video you just import the media
like you did a video clip and then drag
it onto the timeline right underneath
the video where you want it to go
sometimes I'll have it played throughout
the entire video sometimes I just have
it pop-up but it's really important for
if you get reposted not everyone will
credit you so if you have your watermark
in there it will already be credited
they can't take that away also I had
music in every single one of my
Instagram videos I get my music from
nocopyrightsounds on YouTube I'll leave
them linked down below
they are just no copyright music I do
always leave the title and artist and
usually a nocopyrightsounds release in
the Instagram video as well giving them
credit but you would just import the
mini media clip like usual drag it onto
the timeline where it has a little music
symbol and then you can play with the
sound there I usually have my volume at
about 20 you can fade in and fade out if
you want I usually just do that for
YouTube and then once the video is
complete I will hit export I put my
export settings on the highest you can
get I think it's like 1920 by 1080
that's like the most HD so people can
watch in 1080 on YouTube I wonder share
also has different export settings you
can export directly to your YouTube
channel if you want you can pick the
export format I typically will just send
it to my desktop and then I actually
take that and email it to my email
address so it's on my phone and that's
how I upload to Instagram
sure there are easier ways to do this
but this is what's worked for me so that
is what I'm sticking with and then once
I have it emailed to myself and it's on
my phone here is the video that we
created so I just share and upload to
Instagram now this took me
embarrassingly a long time to figure out
you see that little button right down
there
that will take it to full screen again
so it's not so zoomed in and you also
have better quality when it's more in
the full screen and you can see the
entire video that took me a really long
time to get I never use filters I pretty
much never use filters on anything but
especially videos I try to pick a fun
cover people seem to like pouring out of
liquids I don't I don't know why but I
find that these covers kind of get the
best response so I pick a eye catching
cover and I'll hit share and then from
here I go through I will put down every
product that I'm using and I tag those
companies so I'm just gonna exit out of
here get back into my actual Instagram
and show you that video because it is
already on Instagram so I go through I
tag all of the companies I don't know if
we will be able to read them but I take
all of the companies and say what
products that I'm using in case anybody
is wondering and I also use I use like
20 hashtags in my videos I think you can
use up to 30 I typically use around 20 I
tagged the companies sometimes they'll
take the products sometimes I'll take
like repost sites things like that but
that is what I do to edit my Instagram
videos and then how I upload them if you
have any specific questions on Instagram
videos please do leave them in the
comments down below I do read and
respond to all of your comments so I
hope you found this helpful like I said
it was really requested so I wanted to
make sure I got it done now I'm just
playing with my phone here because I
don't know what else to do but I figured
I would still be talking at this point
but there you go I hope you found this
video helpful please do give it a thumbs
up if you did make sure to describe make
sure to subscribe before you go and I'll
get you real soon and my next one bye
guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
