I'm so excited for today's video because
this has been the most requested video
ever and it is how I apply false
eyelashes this video has been requested
since i started my channel people
started to ask and they just keep asking
and keep asking and you ask on
snapchatting vance has got an Instagram
and I've kept putting it off because
even though i love pass eyelashes i've
been wearing from them for years I wear
them so often I was very hesitant about
filming one it's simply because I don't
have any black professional lighting yet
i only use natural lighting and I just
thought when you like zoom up close your
lighting kind of goes weird and I was
like I don't know people are even gonna
be able to see what I'm doing like is it
gonna look ok but another reason is
because I'm not like hands-free like
when I do things I have to hold a mirror
and do it because I don't have any like
mirrors or anything in front of me so I
have to hold a mirror and I wasn't
really good at doing it like one-handed
I was better at applying lashes and
liner and everything in an actual mirror
where I had both hands but I've been
practicing I've been working hard and
getting used like the one hand in I
think I'm doing better but also when it
comes to like lighting and things like I
need to film this video so many people
have asked for it I can't just like keep
putting it off and I planned out how the
video would go and then I started
watching other people's eyelash
tutorials too I was like most of the
time it's talking you know I want to
tell you guys my tips that's what you
want to know to put an eyelash on only
takes a minute but the majority of this
video is going to be talking to you and
me telling you my tips and my practices
and how I do things and then yes I will
actually show you how you put an eyelash
on but for the majority it's just going
to be me talking to you it's just like a
regular video so I'm like I should not
have been this scared of this video and
put it off for so long so I apologize
but I finally gotten my ish together and
we are going to do some false lash
practice I have been doing lashes for a
very long time I've worn for years I've
always wanted like eyelash extensions
and instead I just always went out and
bought eyelashes so I've been putting
them on for years and years and years
but you know they still sometimes give
me trouble I'm not always perfect at
putting on lashes but
happy to share with you guys my best
tips my best practices what I do that
helps me get my eyelash game looking
good so if you would like to see how I
apply false lashes and my tips and
tricks please keep watching one tip that
I have that might seem kind of random
but I've run into this before is that I
actually apply the false lashes and I
feel like most people apply false lashes
after you have finished your eye makeup
I know that sometimes that can get
frustrating because you'll get your eye
shadow game together and you'll get your
wink liner and then you come in with
eyelash and the glue does funny things
and that heady stuff is going places and
your lashes don't look good and you just
want to take it off and start all over
but really best practice is do your eye
makeup first and then do your lashes
last it just makes more sense when
you're actually putting on your makeup
that you're not fighting to put shadows
on over a band it also is pretty
difficult to put on eyeliner over a band
I do it sometimes but really just with
like a liquid liner using any other
liner over our band really doesn't work
out so that's one of my tips is after
you do your eye makeup then you come in
with your lashes another tip that I have
is if you're a beginner I would say like
go pretty heavy on the eyeliner and use
like a dark eyeliner it's one of my tips
because the liner can kind of help hide
the band and it can also kind of give
you like a guide of where to put the
lashes if that makes any sense but
really the reason why I use it is to
kind of help hide the band so i'll put
the eyeliner down first like i say i'll
come and i'll put the lash down and not
every time it just kind of depends what
my adhesive is doing usually is i will
come back in with like a liquid liner
like a thicker like liquid liner and put
that over the band to help disguise that
lash band even more because we don't
want the lash band to be super obvious
you want it to like be as camouflage as
you possibly can so one of the biggest
tips that I have whenever anyone asks me
like what's the wanted that you could
give with false eyelashes my biggest
biggest tip is to trim the eyelashes so
the eyelashes that i'm going to put on
today are these are dull wispies they
look like this and can you see how long
those lashes are your eyes are now
that long typically so you are not going
to use this entire eyelash so what you
want to do is trim them and I will
actually go through how I trim them when
I get into the actual demo part of it
for so long i would not trim my
eyelashes it would make my eyelashes
look weird it would make my eyelashes be
uncomfortable like it just would not
feel right on the eyes and I just think
it makes your eyes look even more
unnatural so you definitely want to trim
the lashes number one number one tip I
have when it comes to eyelashes trim
those suckers so what I like to do when
it comes to my eyelashes is I like to
use an eyelash adhesive the two that I
use the most often this one is from duo
I know this is a pretty common one that
people use and this is in their dark
tone and it's really like a dark gray
and the other one that I really like is
from kiss and it is their black adhesive
it looks like this I get both of mine on
amazon and they're fairly inexpensive i
think they might also be at like drug
stores and things like that but i
usually just order mine off amazon I
like adhesive more than I like eyelash
glue the reason being is every single
time that I have tried out eyelash glue
I cannot get the lashes to stick either
right away they will not stick on and
like every time that I press them down
they would pop back up and I'm like okay
or else i would like sort of get them on
there and then within an hour like I
remember one time very vividly using a
glue going on with friends we were going
on a party bus left my house went and
picked up a friend got to the party bus
location and she's like um you're here
your eyelash and I was like you got to
be kidding me and I had brought the
glute with me but I'm like why would I
why would I glue this back on that
clearly glue does not work and so I just
had to forgo my lashes for that night
which never makes me happy but in all
the times that I have tried to use
eyelash glue it does not work for me so
that's why i 100% prefer to use adhesive
for some reason it just works better
these are my two favorite ones I can
find them on Amazon and link them below
but duo and kiss again I like the ones
like how these are both this is black
and this is like a dark grey again that
helps kind of like hide the band as well
and sometimes
if you put too much adhesive on or you
don't let it get completely tacky before
you put the eyelashes on when you
actually stick them on that adhesive can
still like shine through and if you have
a white it's going to look very very
unnatural so if you have a dark tone
it's a little bit easier to mask and
then especially if you put like a liquid
liner on top of it it helps camouflage
it even more so I definitely suggest
using dark tone adhesives so like I
mentioned there when I was talking about
the adhesive getting tachy that is like
probably like my tip number two when it
comes to eyelashes is don't just
immediately put the adhesive on the
eyelash and then stick it on your eye
most people say to wait at least 30
seconds I probably wait more towards
like 50 to 60 seconds because I really
want to make sure that I'm not just
putting like something super wet onto my
eye because that's what's going to get
things funky you're going to get
adhesives everywhere you just do want to
make sure that it is tacky so I suggest
you know 30 to 60 seconds wait blow on
the eyelash if you were putting it on
yourself you know try to make sure that
gets a little bit tacky before you put
it on because that's really gonna help
save you you know you don't want it to
be dry because then it's not going to
stick to your eyelid you just want it to
be nice and tacky so just just take a
breath just wait a while usually like do
a dance or like have a snack while I'm
waiting for the IDS have to get tacky
but make sure you do that recently I've
really come to prefer putting on my
eyelashes with tweezers this is a pair
of tweezers that I have I just got them
from CVS they are like super super sharp
sharp tweezers I used to prefer my
finger but I was finding that it was
just kind of like almost like ruining my
eye makeup especially if I had like a
little bit more dramatic makeup on cuz I
was like getting my fingers everywhere
in there and it was kind of becoming
more of a hassle it took me a little bit
to get used to the tweezers I would say
if you're a beginner your fingers are
probably going to be easier but i'm glad
that i switched to a tweezers because i
have found it to become easier with time
it was not easy at first to make the
change but i feel like i've gotten a
little a little bit better now i like
using the really sharp ones because i
just feel like i can get right in there
and grab let the inner corner and put it
down or I can grab the outer edge and
really bring it over and it's just
really been helping me so I prefer to
use the tweezers but sometimes when I'm
in a jam I'll use my fingers you know
it's really going to be what your
preferences if you want to use fingers
or if you want to use a tool them on I
try not to go too far in the inner
corner try to make sure that I focus
more on like the outer edge which I
think looks like a little bit more
natural when you have like the outer
lashes I like the really like full and
you know fluttery effect because if you
get it too far into the inner corner of
your eye a it's going to be very
uncomfortable and it's probably gonna
like poke you frequently I've done it
several times you're probably going to
do it too I'm probably going to do it
again in the future but it also just can
kind of look unnatural unless you get it
in like the most precise perfect spot
the band is probably going to be too
high for the inner corner and then it's
going to look weird and it's going to be
uncomfortable lot of times I'll focus
the inner corner to start like right
after you know you have like those
little baby inner corner lashes I start
the inner corner of the lash right after
those lashes so I'm focusing the
majority of the lash on the outer edge
and I think it looks more natural and it
feels more comfortable so that's
something to think about to when you're
trimming them is aligning them up
exactly where you want that to be in
regards to that to another tip is to
like try to do your best to line up your
lashes and sometimes this can be hard
especially when you have different
shapes I my eyes are two different
shapes so when it comes to like winged
liner and lashes it sometimes can be
very odd because I have like one very
almond I and one I that's not very
almond-shaped so it's very different
when I do my eye makeup because my
shapes are so different but I just try
to pay attention because sometimes when
i put the lash down it goes where I
didn't expect it to go and I can try to
fix it as best as I can but sometimes
I'm like well dinner corners a little
farther this way so when you put this
flash on you want the inner corner to be
a little farther this way you just want
to pay attention to where that first
lash when so you can line it up with the
second lash so you can look the most
natural right another tip that I have is
to put mascara on before you put on your
lashes you know definitely put mascara
on the bottom lashes but don't forget
about your top lashes I do this opt-in
and it gets me really angry but you want
to put masks
on your top lashes because it's going to
help your natural eyelashes blend into
the false eyelashes you also don't
really want to put mascara on false
eyelashes it's not going to be the end
of the world if you do and I still do it
sometimes especially when I forget to
put mascara on my lashes before I put on
lashes yes it's just helping to like
blend the natural and the falsies
together so you don't have like your
actual lashes like some people have
lashes that's kind of like almost stick
straight out and then when you put a
latch on and you haven't put mascara you
can still see your natural lashes like
sticking out and then these big false
lashes and it can look kind of funky
also it just helps for the like
longevity of the lashes they say that
lashes will last longer if you don't put
mascara on them which you know yes I
definitely can see that they can start
to look more like crummy and icky the
more that you're leaving mascara on them
because it's not like you're taking my
eye makeup remover to your false lashes
am i right but a lot of times what I
will do if I do put mascara on my lashes
beforehand sometimes what I'll do is
I'll just take the very edge of the
mascara wand and like touch it right at
the base of my lashes if that makes
sense and that kind of can help merge
the two together so they look a little
bit more natural and that way I'm not
putting mascara all over my lashes it's
just kind of right on the base there to
help blend the two together and also a
lot of times I'm someone who wears like
not every day but I like to wear more
like dramatic lashes and sometimes if I
put mascara over on top of them I just
kind of I'm starting to look a little
bit silly so you usually don't need
mascara with false lashes but that's
just another tip and you practice and
you're starting to begin do something
very simple with your eye makeup you
know don't put a lot into it if you're
just simply going to be practicing but
also along those same lines is just
practice that's what i did with lashes
and that's what I've done with winged
eyeliner like before i go to bed at
night or something like i have nowhere
to go I've nowhere to be I would take
the lashes and I would practice putting
them on and practice moving them around
same thing with wing lighter i would
just practice that night because then i
can just wash it off and forget it ever
happen
and that really does help like practice
really will help you so if you really do
want to get it down that's a suggestion
that I have you know don't be afraid to
take them off and start over but also if
you really do want to try to get better
just practice when you have some free
time on your hands and you want to try
to get the technique down and then my
other just big tip that I have is just
be patient lashes can be hard lashes can
be tricky know that you might get them
on perfectly one day and the next day
it's not going to be pretty at all but
just try to be patient and just remember
it's just makeup it's just fun we can
take it off we can start over no worries
don't get upset about it just have fun
with it I'm pin to the demo of it so
like I said we're going to use these are
Dell wispies our dell is one of my
favorite brands of lashes you can get
them at the drugstore they're extremely
inexpensive they have a really thin band
so they're really easy to work with
especially for beginners I think they
are so comfortable but they also have so
many different styles if natural and
glamorous super glamorous super fluffy
wispies are some of my absolute
favorites the demi wispies are also
really nice i like the Glamour's i just
got some naturals the double ups are so
cool for dramatic look our deals like
really the way to go so what i'm going
to do first is put it on my eye and trim
it up so one more quick thing that i
want to show you guys if you can see by
the lashes this has less lashes over
there we're on the other corner has a
fuller lash you want to pay attention to
that because when you trim it your
lashes you don't want to trim on the
short side because that is to mimic your
inner corner of your lashes where your
lashes are nestled so you know that this
lash is going to go on this I because it
matches with your inner corner so when
you cut your lashes make sure you start
at the fuller end because then if you
cut the inner corner lashes then you're
not going to have as much of a natural
look I've done it before I swear to you
I have done it before and I've gotten so
mad but it just kind of makes you look a
little funky so make sure that you when
you trim the lashes you trim on the side
that has the longer lashes and just make
sure you line up the inner corner in the
lashes in your corner of your eye get it
so I'm going to take the lash I'm going
to set it where I think I want the inner
corner to go and then you see how much
lash is right here I'm going to trim all
of that so make sure it's lined up I'm
going to grab it right there take it off
I'm going to trim about to see where
that tweezers I'm going to trim that
much off and then come back on and make
sure we got a good so when trimming the
lash i recommend trimming like starting
at the band versus trying to come up
through the lashes I've tried doing that
before it's just trickier so I'm going
to start at the band and just do a
little cut put these back on and just
make sure they look good I think I'm
actually going to trim just a little bit
more I like having them trimmed up and I
also watch luster looks eyelash video
which was super helpful and she likes
some pretty trimmed up to and I was like
you know what that is actually what I
like going for it just really does make
them more comfortable so I'm just going
to cut off just tiny bit more Oh get
nice because you know obviously this is
a brand new pair of lashes that I wanted
to try with you guys but once you have
them trimmed then you won't have to do
this every time you know obviously ok
let's try again and you guys see how I'm
already like how even just like measure
them up I'm coming from the top and
placing them down that's how I apply
them as well ok so I like the looks of
this so I'm going to use my kiss black
adhesive and when it comes to putting
the adhesive on I like to start start
small and go bigger if need it because
if you put like a huge like coupon it's
not going to be cute to take it and I
start in the centres where I like to
start run it all over the band you want
a good amount of that adhesive on there
but you don't want it to be so gloopy
that it's going to take like forever to
dry and then cause you a mess and then
I'm really going to focus this one on
the outer corners because I always want
to make sure that outer corners stick
they tend to give the most trouble I'll
we wait you can blow on it you can shake
it you can dance but I'll be back in a
hot second and we will put this bad boy
on I so we've let the adhesive dry
you can see what the tweezers I'm
holding it like right in the center of
the lash and then I'm going to come down
just because I was doing as I was like
getting ready to trim them I'm going to
come from the top and set them down onto
my lash let's do it okay get the middle
on first I press it down with my fingers
to get the middle to stick and then I'll
take the tweezers I'll come to the outer
edge and just check the inner corner pop
it on and then I just take my fingers
and kind of push everything together
there's one I let go did I go okay I
think that one okay let's move on to the
next one see how much we need a trim
like can you imagine having your eyelash
look like that like it's not going to
look good it's going to be uncomfortable
this is why we tryn so I'm going to grab
approximately where we're going to trim
look again just to be sure okay and then
this is a good time to kind of look look
and see are they going to match up well
that's pretty good ok so now we'll put
the adhesive on and when you're first
putting the adhesive on think start
small and build up make sure you get the
inner and outer corners good because
those are the trickiest trickiest parts
and then i'll let the idea civ get tacky
and then we'll do it again and cross our
fingers that it goes as smoothly as the
first one coming in from the top setting
it down I'm gonna take my inner corner
and bring it over and then again tap it
down with my finger do the same thing
for the outer corner make sure we're all
connected now we got to lashes on and I
hope that was helpful for you guys guys
I got the lashes on and now would be
time where I would examine them and see
like do I need to put the liquid liner
on top to help hide the bands pretty
well camouflaged to me like
you guys can see I can't really see the
band I can't really see any adhesive
usually with first-time lashes you don't
need it because there's so like new and
fresh and clean and yummy hello first
time lashes but usually you don't need
it but if so a really good liner that I
recommend to go on top of the lash band
is the NYC liquid liner it's basically
the only thing that I use my NYC liquid
liner for because I find it really hard
to work with but overall ash man it
works good one more tip that I wanted to
mention to you and it's about like where
for your lashes I really do suggest
after you use them to make sure you take
the adhesive off the band you're going
to want to do this anyways the next time
you go to put those lashes on but the
sooner that you can get that adhesive
off I think it's better for your lashes
and definitely because you will have
adhesive sticking to the lashes it'll be
like kind of clumpy I just take my
tweezers and pick it off the lash you
want to be very careful and not go too
fast because sometimes you can actually
take the individual lashes right off a
lash strip done that too but just be
careful take your time but get that
adhesive off you do not want to put
adhesive on top of old adhesive that's
not going to do you any favors make sure
you're keeping your lashes clean because
that'll have them last longer as well
but other than that that is everything
that I have for this video I really hope
this helped you guys I know I don't have
like the best lighting yet or the bus
set up yet but really I just wanted to
share with you guys my best tips and
practices for putting false lashes on
don't be afraid of it lashes is just
like one liner they can smell your fear
just be confident be patient take it
slow trim your lashes wait for your
adhesive to get tacky and then calmly
place them on your eyelash you can do it
