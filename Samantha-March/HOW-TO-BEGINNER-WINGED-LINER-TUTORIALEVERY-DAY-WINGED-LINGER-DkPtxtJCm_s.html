today's video is going to be a how-to
winged liner or like basic everyday so
this is the winged liner look that I'm
doing it's a very simple wing definitely
designed for beginners or for an
everyday look it's not any sort of like
super bowl eyeliners super huge liner
anything like that I wanted it to be
geared more towards beginner / every day
because I am a beginner in makeup and I
don't do a super bold winged liner look
every single day this is mostly the
winged liner look that I go for so that
is the first one that I wanted to share
with you guys of course if you would
like to see something a little bit
bolder in the future please do just
comment below and let me know if you'd
like to see that it has more and more
I've been kind of experimenting with
going a little bit bolder with my
eyeliner and I think I'm kind of getting
the hang of it but of course I didn't
want to make a video doing something
that I don't feel entirely comfortable
with myself yet and then trying to teach
you guys on it that just doesn't make a
lot of sense but I have gotten a lot of
requests to do a winged liner video
especially after I did my how to false
lashes video this was like being
requested so much after I did that so I
wanted to go ahead and do it but make it
something my own and something that I
felt comfortable doing so that is what
we're going to do today so hopefully you
guys will find it helpful and you won't
find it super intimidating like I said
I'm still very very new to make up so
thinking about winged liner in the
beginning I was like there's no way
there's there's simply no way that I
would ever be able to do that and just
with a lot of practice i'm really
excited where my winged liner is going
so i wanted to go over just a few tips
and tricks in the beginning and then i
will do a demo for you guys and then
we'll be out of here hopefully this will
be a quick easy painless video but give
you guys an idea of how i started to do
my winged liner so if you want to hear
some of my tips and tricks and the
liners that i like to use please keep
watching did for this video in the liner
that i like hands down at recommend is
from sigma it is their gel liner in
wicked witch is just a black gel liner
and then also of the sigma e 06 brush so
mine is dirty because I just used it for
the demo portion of this video but the
winged liner
il-6 brush is like so tiny and so
precise and has really really changed my
gel liner game I'm super grateful to
Sigma they actually sent me both of
these products to review and I
absolutely fell in love with them I
recommend them so so often do you think
gel liner is very easy to work with
especially when you have a bomb brush to
go in hand with it like the brush I
think is really even more key than the
liner and this brush is hands-down when
I recommend I know it's a favorite of so
many peoples so both of these will be
linked down below but I have two other
liners that I want to kind of go over
with you guys as well so one liner that
I also see so many people on YouTube
talking about is the NYC liquid liner it
looks like this there has been several
winged eyeliner tutorial videos that I
see and people are using this liner so I
was like okay I'm gonna go buy it it's
very inexpensive I got mine at walmart
it was like maybe three dollars and I
got home and it was like oh gosh this
actually looks really intimidating
here's what the brush looks like so the
brush is very long but it's also very
loose meaning you don't have a lot of
control when you put this on and it can
kind of go everywhere like if you are
not super precise and have a super
steady hand this could get messy real
quick and that's usually what happens to
me I have been playing around with this
for probably six months now and even
just yesterday Hector I did my eye Micah
bells like you know what I'm gonna go in
with NYC liner and I ended up getting it
like way off my lash line I had to go
wash off my eye makeup and start again
it's just to me it's very hard to use if
you are more experienced with winged
liner and like you really got your
technique down I think this could be a
good one for you because it's supposed
to be amazing I like the way that it
looks after you apply it and I do think
it's long lasting but one other con I
have with it is when you put it on and
then you immediately blink are you look
up you get immediate transfer which is
super annoying it's not to tell you guys
I see a lot of videos where people are
recommending this and recommending it
for your winged liner if you're a
beginner you're just starting out I
would probably skip this one other liner
that I want to talk about is one that I
actually really love and it's from
Maybelline and it's their master precise
eyeliner this is a liquid liner and this
is what the tip looks like so again it's
very long very sure
very pointed at the end but what makes
it different from the NYC one is that
the tip is very like stiff and
controlled so you have more control when
you're actually doing your liner which I
found to be really important before i
got the sigma 1 this was what i was
using all the time i feel like i'm going
to have to run out of it at some point
because literally this was what i was
grabbing every single day to make my
winged liner I hands down will recommend
this one everything that I talked about
well of course be linked in my
description box below as always but this
was one that really really helps me out
so if you're just trying to get into
like the liquid liner phase check out
this one from maybelline because i think
it's really good or if you're looking
into gel eyeliner check out the sigma 1
and e 06 brush i think they are amazing
was putting together this video and when
I was going to say I was like you know
truly I don't feel like I have that many
tips and tricks for winged liner it's
not like my last video where I had like
20 minutes of like tips and tricks to
talk to you guys about one thing that I
would say is if you are using brushes
make sure your brush is clean there's a
lot of times where you know I'm lazy I
don't always clean my brushes in between
every single use of them and I would
have used my liner brush you know even
two or three times and then I would go
in and try to apply liner and it would
be very chunky and streaky and just it
would not be a smooth application make
sure that you are at least spot cleaning
you don't have to deep clean your
brushes every single time you use them
but at least spot clean your brushes and
especially for a liner it's gonna make
your liner going so much smoother if you
were starting with a clean brush my
brush was dirty and I immediately went
in with my cinema secrets dry spray and
just did a quick spot clean of it so
would be ready to go for today's liner
so that is a huge tip but it would have
the thing it sounds silly but don't be
scared of your winged liner because I
swear the days we're like I'm not really
feeling it or I'm just like maybe you've
not had like a good makeup application
day in general and now I'm movin on two
winged liner like I think the liner can
like smell your fear like you really do
have to go in with confidence and just
be like you know what it's gonna happen
like today is the day that I'm going to
do the winged liner and I'm gonna do it
well like you have to have confidence
it's such like a silly thing but I
really do it when I go like before I put
on liner I'm like you got it girl you
got this no fear
just do your winged liner my biggest
tips and this is what i said in my last
video as well is just practice and get
to know your eye shape so what I did was
the same thing again with the lashes
like at night or I don't have anywhere
to go I just have some extra time on my
hand just go to your mirror and just
practice and when you screw up no one
cares just wipe it off you don't have
any other makeup on your face you're not
going anywhere it doesn't matter you
mess up that's fine just take makeup
remover and boom boom wipe it off try
again keep practicing practices really
like the most important thing and like
what like what I said like I'm not super
great at bold liner yet because I need
to keep practicing like practice get
your technique down also do learn the
shape of your eyes and where exactly
your liner looks best you're going to
have a preference of where you want to
start your liner how high you want your
lawyer Leonard to go how how large you
want your wing to be and again that all
takes practice and it takes learning
your eye shapes we all have different
eye shapes a lot of times your eyes will
be different shaped my eyes have
different shapes and that took me a
little bit it's hang up when starting
one liner some like wait I started in
the exact same spot but what minor is
higher and one side is lower like what's
going on here and it took me a little
bit to kind of understand the shapes of
my eyes and how it affects putting liner
on them so take some time examine your
eyes in the mirror and just keep
practicing also say experiment with the
different types do you like the liquid
liner do you like a gel eyeliner do you
like the liner pencils like kind of
experiment and see what's best for you
for me my favorites like I said are the
Sigma gel liner and then the Maybelline
liquid liner a huge fan of like regular
liner pencils like the color pop liners
are even like the kit cosmetics liners I
don't like them so much to create a wing
like if I just want a little whiner
smudged on the top I'll use those but I
save those for like the waterline I
prefer gels and liquids for my wind
liner but you might have a different
preference so just kind of experiment
around and see and look in your makeup
collection and see what it is that best
suits you but really guys I don't want
this video to be a whole lot of talking
and really those are my best like tips
and tricks for creating liner my biggest
one honestly is just practice practice
practice watch a lot of different
tutorials and
with the different tips that you can
pick up I swear each time i watch
another winged liner tutorial video I'm
like oh I could try that too so there's
gonna be a lot of tips and tricks out
there I hope mine help you if you are a
beginner or you just want to learn how
to create like in everyday type of
weighing us what we're going here for
today and I hope this helps you out so
let's hop over into the demo portion and
I hope you enjoy so of course using the
signal wicket liner and the e 06 brush
when I first come in I just do my upper
lash line first it's just what I prefer
to do before I go in with the wing I
just like to create the nice basic line
on my upper lash line so that is what
I'm doing first then I will dip back
into and gets more product on my brush
and I'll start to create the wing so I
start from the very edge of my eye and
then I just kind of follow that line up
and I bring it out towards the tail end
of my brow and I have firm pressure
until I get to the end and then I
lighten up the pressure on the brush so
we get that thinner line then I flip my
brush over so the point its side is like
facing up toward my eyebrow and I come a
little bit less than half away and I
will drag it back it down to meet the
product that i've already placed on
there and then I just kind of fill in
the gaps and that is really it guys it's
pretty simple if you want to do
something a little bit bolder I would
just say go up a little bit higher on
your tail and that's how you get a bit
of a bolder look but I'm just going to
do the same thing what the next i I just
create the top lash line first and then
I come back in with more product and
actually create the wing and you can
come back as many times as you need to
you can get it if you want it black or
you can do that or if you want to make
it bolder I mean you can do that you can
start small and build it up but that is
how i create my everyday a winged
eyeliner and i hope you found the
helpful

for my beginner go to every day a winged
liner tutorial I hope you guys found
this helpful in some way hopefully it
helps you guys out like i said i am such
a huge fan of watching tutorials on
