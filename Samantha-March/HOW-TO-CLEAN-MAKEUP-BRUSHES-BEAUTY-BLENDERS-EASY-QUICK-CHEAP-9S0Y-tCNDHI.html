today's video is going to be all about
how I clean my makeup brushes and I'm
gonna actually like show you at the sink
how I clean them but beforehand I just
wanted to kind of jump in and let you
know kind of explain more like the
products that I use so when I first
started cleaning my makeup brushes I was
using like antibacterial dish soap I was
mixing in with it like olive oil or even
coconut oil and as they just became like
such a process I felt like I was having
to measure out the ingredients because
when I put the oils in sometimes if it
was too oily like my brushes just felt
disgusting for a long time and I'd
constantly trying to clean them like
trying to clean the oil out of them and
so I just started kind of looking around
YouTube and trying to find out like what
other people do and what they use and
now I have my own little routine down
and so I wanted to share that with you
guys
brushes is Just Dial antibacterial hand
soap it looks like this it's a hand soap
that has moisturizer in it so a lot of
people when they use like dish soap or
even like baby shampoo is another common
thing to clean makeup brushes they're
adding in olive oil or coconut oil to
help kind of like condition and
moisturize the brushes so the brushes
and bristles don't get like too stiff
and harsh and so this dial that I found
it is antibacterial which is key
whatever you're using you wanted to be
antibacterial because you want it to be
removing the bacteria from your makeup
brushes but it says it's hand soap with
moisturizer so my brushes feel the same
look the same don't shed I mean from
when I went to dish soap and olive oil
to just the dial soap the brushes are
exactly the same they didn't do I didn't
have any sort of like reactions to my
face and it just speeds up my time so
much because all I do with this is pump
a few squirts into like a glass bowl I
switch the brushes around rinse them and
boom we're done so this is how I like to
like deep clean my brushes now and it
just has sped up the time for me so much
it's so easy and I think this is like
under $2 or something I just go to our
grocery store super easy
that I do that is honestly like kind of
even quicker than that is just using a
bar of Dove soap looks like this so all
I do with this is you'll see in the
video I just kind of like wet the bar
soap wet the brush
rub the brush on to the soap rinse it
off boom we're done this is much easier
for when I'm like in a really big rush I
just want to get a couple makeup brushes
cleaned like maybe all of my eye brushes
are dirty and I know I'm gonna do a look
in the morning just use this boom breezy
we're done we're out it's all good so I
always have some Dove soap hanging
around the house this is also how I
clean Beauty blenders is I use the Dove
soap you just you'll see it in the video
but I just rub the Beauty Blender onto
the Dove soap run it under water use my
fingers to get all the soap out and
beauty blenders are clean so I recently
just received this product from Sigma
Beauty but it has totally changed the
game of cleaning makeup brushes and this
is their Sigma Express gloves so they
have a few different items for cleaning
makeup brushes they have a map that you
can put on this think it actually sent
me a glove which I'm so appreciative of
but it just makes it so much easier
you'll see in the video after I like
what the brush was soaked I then run it
on here because it has these edges and
these ridges so it's helping to clean
the brushes and honestly it's just so
much easier than using my palm and like
little when you clean a lot of brushes
and you're only using your hands for
help by the time you get done your hand
just looks horrendous and feels
horrendous and old man
so this brush has seriously been like
such a game changer when it comes to
cleaning my brushes I highly suggest the
glove or the mat I can leave them both
linked below from Sigma or another
affordable option like what I was going
to do the next time I went to like the
Dollar Tree was to pick up like I think
it's like an oven mitt but they have
like some of these like ridges on them
as well and they're a dollar so that can
be another option for you if maybe you
can't afford the Sigma one or you you
know you just don't want to get
something like that you want something a
little bit cheaper for your makeup
brushes look at like the dollar tree or
Dollar General or something like that
for those little like oven mitt thingies
they should work want to mention what I
use to spot clean my brushes because I
didn't
I include this in the video mostly
because what I use the spotclean is
almost gone so what I used a spot clean
my brushes is from cinema secrets it
looks like this it is their makeup brush
cleaner and what I love about this I get
mine at Sephora but what I love about
this is that it's a like dry spray so
you will spray your brushes with it and
then I just spray my brush into a paper
towel and it removes any of the product
and it also is dry so you don't have to
wait for your what brushes to dry which
is amazing and it's really good for if
you're doing a makeup look where like
you're gonna use the same brush for
several different shades you can put one
shade down use the dry cleaner go right
into the next shade use a dry cleaner
and it's amazing like if you can see I
clearly love mine it's almost gone
that's why I did include it in the video
because I actually can't spray it
anymore because it's so down there I
just like kind of tip it out and put a
little on the brush and sprawl it on the
paper towel like it's a different
process than what I would normally do
but the next time I order from Sephora
it will definitely be ordering another
one at these they do have them in bigger
sizes but I think I'm just gonna keep
the spray bottle because it's so much
easier just to spray I take it when I
travel it's small so this is not like a
deep cleaning makeup brush cleaner this
is simply for spot training spot
cleaning so don't confuse this with like
using an antibacterial soap or something
that that's actually going to clean your
makeup brushes know what I'm saying
those are the products that I use to
clean up my makeup brushes I typically
will deep clean my brushes usually every
two to three weeks I spot clean as
needed or I just even go in with the
Dove soap every once in a while if I
know like especially my foundation
brushes because I only have two
foundation brushes I will use the Dove
soap if I feel like the foundation is
just getting like too much on there I
mean my deep cleaning every couple of
weeks but obviously clean your makeup
brushes is so important if you don't
want to be spreading bacteria onto your
face like you have to have to have to
clean your makeup brushes it's so key
for your skin care as well like if you
don't have clean makeup brushes your
face is probably going to show that I
also do show in the footage what I use
to clean like actual handles of my
brushes because don't forget that you
need to clean those as well those are
getting dirty
especially my foundation brushes if I
put foundation on my hand and then I go
in I usually end up the foundation on
the brush you want to make sure you are
cleaning that as well one other tip that
I would say when cleaning your makeup
brushes is don't clean all the same
types of makeup brushes at the same time
like I have two foundation brushes I
will never clean them at the same time
because even though it typically only
takes them like overnight to dry you
don't want to have both foundation
brushes wet or still slightly damp that
you don't want to put foundation on and
then you're like well what do I use so
like foundation brushes blush brushes
and my eye makeup brushes don't clean
all of them at the same time like hyper
rotation for them or else you will
regret that but guys that is gonna be
everything for this video let's hop into
the footage of how I actually clean my
brushes I hope you guys enjoy this video
I hope you take aways some tips from it
I hope you will leave in the comments
below what you use to clean your makeup
brushes because like I said I tried
several different methods before I
actually found one that I felt worked
best for me so I'd love to hear what you
guys do as well I hope you will give
this video a thumbs up if you did enjoy
it please subscribe before you go and
enjoy how I clean my makeup brushes hi
guys hey guys so I will talk through
this first one I use my dial
antibacterial soap I just have a little
dish that I pump a few of squirts into
and then for the first example I'm just
taking my morphe and 439 brush which is
used for foundation so it's always super
dirty I just run that under this thing
to get it wet and then I swish it around
in the soap making sure it gets nice and
saturated with the soap and then I take
my Sigma Express Glove which I love
using for these bigger brushes it just
makes it so much easier and I just run
the brush along with the ridges on there
it's so easy and so handy to use to run
it under the sink make sure it gets
totally clean and then once I'm done
cleaning it I'll just tilt the brush in
like a downward motion and just making
sure I'm getting all the soap off of
there and I give it a squeeze to make
sure all the waters off of it and then
to set it to dry it just make sure it's
at this tilted angle and that the water
will be running down
and off the brush and not back into the
handle I think that's really important
to keep the longevity of your brush make
sure it doesn't rust and all that good
stuff so yeah here is a few more
demonstrations
so as the brushes are drying I make sure
I go in and just kind of flip them so
one side isn't being crushed just
because I do lamb on the bristles I just
kind of rotate the brushes make sure I'm
reshaping them in case I need some help
there and I think that really helps make
sure they look good once we're done and
then to go on to clean my dirty dirty
Beauty Blender I used a bar of Dove soap
I just get the Beauty Blender wet the
bar of soap wet and then I just rub the
Beauty Blender you know pretty firmly
onto the bar soap you can see my
concealer my foundation is already
coming off onto the soap just do that as
many times as I need and then I take my
thumbs and kind of like firmly make sure
I'm getting the soap out underneath the
water and I do this until the water runs
clear you know sometimes I have to come
back in and do it a couple of times at
the Beauty Blender is really dirty once
I'm done I just give it a few good
squeezes just making sure I'm getting
all the soap out of it and then we have
a clean Beauty Blender it's super easy
and super quick I like to use the Dove
soap for like my eye brushes as well
it's just really easy to use the soap
get them all clean sometimes I'll do
like several eye brushes at once just
because they're smaller so it's just
more time consuming it's time saver and
I will also sometimes use my Sigma
Express glove to use to clean the
brushes as well I start with the Dove
soap but then I take it over to the
glove I mean it's just whatever my
preference is there's so many different
ways that you can do it but these are
just a few of my favorite ways I also
like to use the Dove soap when I'm using
brushes that I've used for like cream
shadows like what you're seeing right
now I've used a cream shadow I think the
the bar of soap is just so much easier
to use for those brushes and I do the
same thing downward motion make sure all
the soap is off and store them in the
same way
look at those clean brushes so just a
recap of my favorite products the Sigma
Express glove dove bar soap and the dial
antibacterial hand soap to clean the
handles of the brushes I just use some
infecting wipes I just grabbed a wipeout
and I will place it around the handle of
the brush and just give it a good little
cleaning I just think it's really
important to make sure that you are also
cleaning the handles of your brushes
because you know you're touching them
every day you might have makeup on them
I get makeup all over my brushes so it's
just another really important step to
make sure that you are doing and then
when you're complete you have your nice
clean makeup brushes that can go back to
where they belong
