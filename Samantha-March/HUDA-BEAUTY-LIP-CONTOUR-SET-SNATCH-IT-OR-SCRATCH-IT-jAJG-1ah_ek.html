today's video is going to be my second
video in my new snatches or scratch-it
series so I have kicked off a new series
like I said this is me the second video
in it and basically I just review a
product and I let you guys know if I
think you should snatch it up or if I
think that you should scratch it so in
today's video we are going to be talking
about the huda beauty lip contour set so
from what I can tell I believe this set
is exclusive to Sephora I don't see it
on the shop huda beauty website or
anywhere else that I've been able to
look and it also says exclusive on
Sephora so I mean I'm pretty sure it's
exclusive to Sephora I decided to pick
this up I got it during the Sephora vib
sale I can leave my haul video link down
below if you'd want to see it but it was
just very curious about these I have
tried the hooda lashes they're some of
my favorite lashes so does Samantha
style and I have repurchased them
because I like them so much she did come
out also recently with an eyeshadow
palette and I just heard like such mixed
reviews on it and I decided to get the
modern renaissance palette from
Anastasia and I thought those were
pretty similar so I went with a Nastasia
but she's also released a lot of matte
liquid lipsticks and also lip liners and
the feedback that I've been hearing has
been pretty good so when I saw these
sets come out and got pretty excited
because I love sets especially when I
think they're good value I like being
able to try things and try a lot of
different things especially when I'm
trying something new from a brand I
think it's nice to be able to try it
like kind of a variety of products or
shades or things like that so basically
what the lip contour set is it's like a
sleeve here so when you pull it out what
you're getting are two mini matte liquid
lipsticks and then a full-size lip liner
or lip contour is what they call the lip
liners for the Hoonah line so I thought
this was very cool and it's $24 to
purchase a full-sized liquid lipstick is
$20 for a full-size lip contour I
believe as 19 so I was like that seems
like a great deal and these two shades
are different so the one that I got has
the lip liner in trendsetter
and then also the liquid lipstick in
trendsetter and then also the liquid
lipstick in bombshell now at the time
when I'm filming I'm looking at
Sephora's website and this is the only
set available for purchase but when I
was shopping during the VIP sales they
have like three or four of their sets
with the different colors inside so I'm
not sure where those tests have gone and
I'm actually pretty disappointed because
I was making an order from Sephora today
and I was going to purchase another set
and I couldn't find them and I was like
oh okay so I don't know if they're
coming back I don't know where they went
but I'm really disappointed but this one
the one that we're talking about today
in this video is still for sale at
Sephora so I will leave this link down
below I can also link the individual
links to these products as well in case
you would just want to get one or the
other so like I said $24 I thought it
was just a really good value and to be
able to not only try out the formula to
try out a couple different shades try
out the corresponding lip liner I
thought it was fantastic
who'd give a comparison like I said the
lip liner is full-size and then they
liquid lipsticks are each 0.06 for fluid
ounces the full-size liquid lipsticks
are 0.17 fluid ounces I believe so there
is an idea of what the breakdown is so I
have been trying these oh I don't know
for like two weeks maybe like two weeks
I have been trying to wear these a ton
so first I can talk about the lip liner
I have only tried this one twice I'm
just not personally a huge lip liner fan
I like having them because there are
certain times where you just need lip
liner type of things I like having lip
liners because I want to be able to have
the option but they're not something
that I wear on a daily basis but again
this lip liner is in trendsetter I can
try to do a swatch here and I was very
impressed with these lip liners very
impressed super creamy super easy to go
on super pigmented I mean it just glides
right across the lips I had no troubles
at all with the lip liner like I said
I'm not a huge lip liner fan but this
one is definitely a good one so in case
you're interested in getting a lip
contour on its own I would say go for I
think these were really really good but
then to get into the liquid lipstick
so again the shades that I got our
trendsetter and a bombshell trendsetter
is described as a brown nude and
bombshell is described as as a subtle
pinkish nude I would definitely agree
with both I do have trendsetter on my
lips right now
beautiful brown shade I love it like
these are my shades that's why I
gravitated towards this set so I can
also go ahead and just do some quick
swatches on my hand so this first one is
in trendsetter which is has the
corresponding lip liner above it so
there is trendsetter and then the other
one is bombshell so there is that one
this is also my second video filming
using a light I've never had a light
before so sometimes the brightness can
kind of like do crazy things one of my
subscribers told me to turn at my is is
Oh down on my camera so I did that
taking your advice so we're trying it
out it's gonna be kind of like a
learning curve until I get situated with
the lights just cuz you know I've never
had them I was kind of confused where
drives decision um how high know what
setting changes do I have to make to my
camera but we're getting used to it but
again those are the swatches on my hands
okay so I let the swatches dry so there
is what they look like dry again we have
trendsetter up here and bombshell right
here I also have a lot of photos with
the shades on my lips as well on my
Instagram I'm March Beauty where I post
a lot of swatches over there but I will
insert photos in here as well at some
point maybe right now maybe later I
don't know we'll see what editing
Samantha wants to do I never really know
what she wants to do so to move on to
the actual formula of these I will say
that I was super impressed because huda
beauty is not a new new brand but the
the liquid lipsticks were new to her
brand so I was curious how it was going
to go and I was a little hesitant that's
why I didn't buy them when they first
launched she came out with a certain
amount of shades I don't know if it was
like seven or something like that but
she came out with like an initial set of
shades then she released more then I saw
these sets at Sephora and was like okay
I might try the set the formula I think
is fantastic quite honestly this has
become one of my new
favorites and when I use this for the
first time I thought oh my gosh this is
amazing I love this this is great and
I'm like okay I haven't even had it on
my lips for ten minutes like building a
sandwich or something and see what
happens wear it all day see what happens
like you can't fall in love with
something trying it for one time and so
that's why I've been using them as much
as I can I've been wearing them you know
putting them on in the morning wearing
them all the way through night wearing
them through dinner
trying out the different shades trying
it with the lip liner without the lip
liner and I mean just to say that I am
super impressed I really really am and
I'm sorry if you guys can hear a strange
noise my dog is right underneath me
chewing on a bone and she is so loud and
I keep telling her to be quiet and she
looks at me like I'm a dog I don't what
are you saying to me be quiet
No so if you hear a noise
it's Ares chewing on a bone but anyway
it's giving back to this the formula I
thought was amazing so this goes on very
very liquidy I don't know if you'd be
able to tell if I show you like the wand
it is a very liquidy of formula as
compared to like Anastacio Beverly Hills
what lip sticks are very like thick and
moosie and these are very like thin and
liquidy so you really don't need a lot
of product when you put this on because
it'll spread very very easily over the
lips and I think that's a good thing
because I mean hopefully that would mean
that your product would last even longer
if the less product that you have to use
that you're still getting your lips
covered I mean I think that's a good
thing for me personally I tend to like
the like thinner type of formulas for
liquid lipsticks I just feel like
they're more comfortable on the lips I
feel like they're easier to wear with
and I also don't feel like you have to
wear a lip liner with them with
something words like it's that super
moosie texture I feel like you have to
have a lip liner and I feel like you
have to be super super careful when
applying them these I mean you still
have to be careful when you're applying
them because they're a liquid lipstick
obviously but I don't feel like you have
to have like exact precise precision I
don't know that's just my opinion and
I've been super impressed with them
again here is what the wand looks like I
mean it's a pretty standard like what
lipstick wand in my opinion it's nothing
crazy it has like the little groove
right there I mean pretty standard for a
liquid
six I think so that's kind of what it
feels like when it goes on the lips it
also goes on looking very wet it doesn't
dry down immediately I mean it probably
takes like two or three minutes or
something to dry down completely matte
on the lip so it once it does dry down
it is completely matte Oh as to compare
it to like Kylie cosmetics Kylie
cosmetics her look at lipsticks dry on
me in like 30 seconds it's super quick
that it is dried down completely matte
like I said when they do dry down they
dry down completely matte and they are
transfer proof there's no transfer
there's no anything on my hand here so
they do dry down completely matte the
long wear of these I am super impressed
with and I would compare the way that
these wear to these smashbox always on
liquid lipsticks and that to me is a
very very high compliment because that
is my like top number one favorite
liquid lipstick so to compare the
formula to the smashbox is like one of
the highest compliments that i can give
because I think that formula is amazing
but these babies last and they last a
long time
and they last through dinner I was so
impressed I had on bombshell the other
day I had filmed a video I put bombshell
on at about one o'clock in the afternoon
I filmed like a get ready with me at
about one o'clock I filmed a video at
probably four o'clock and then I went
out to dinner with some girlfriends at
about 6 o'clock and I was home around
8:30 ish and the lipstick looked pretty
much like how I put it on at the
beginning of the day I mean it was faded
slightly but nothing to the point like I
don't think I would even have made it to
reapply it like if I was going to film
another video or if I was going to go
out somewhere else I wouldn't have felt
the need to reapply the liquid lipstick
it wears so well and again I wore it
through dinner I was drinking I was
eating you know eating food off a fork
my lips are touching the fork I mean I
was super super impressed so and then I
wore a trendsetter also as well I
applied it at about 10 a.m. and went
my day I lunch with it I ate a sandwich
or a sub with it and then I filmed a
video probably about 2:30 3 o'clock and
when I went to take the liquid lipstick
off I was taking my makeup off and like
filming a video for it so I took my
makeup off at about 5:30 that night but
my lipstick still looked great again I
wouldn't have felt the need to reapply
it if I was going out or filming another
video so I am just hands-down super
impressed with the liquid lipstick
formula from huda beauty that's why I
mentioned in the beginning of the video
I was looking for another set to
purchase because I really wanted to be
able to try out more shades and I liked
him so much it was to the point where I
was like should I just buy one of the
full-sized liquid lipsticks but I was
like no I'm really want to buy these
sets because I think it's a really good
deal to get the full-size lip liner and
the two mini liquid lipsticks for $24
again the full-size lip blender if I
didn't say this is 19 and the full-size
liquid lipsticks are 20 so to get all
three for $24.95 I will definitely be
buying them but if I hear that they're
not coming back or it's just been a
while and they're not coming back
I would purchase a full-size in the
liquid lipsticks because I think that
they are that good again the two shades
that I got I love I mean if these are
your kind of shades I say go for it and
I say get the the set which will be
linked down below again Trent Sutter is
that like nude Brown and a bombshell is
the like pinkish nude shade right here I
think both of them are great I have
definitely looked up more swatch videos
and photos to see what some of the other
ones look like so it might get to the
point where I purchased a full-size and
you know just say hey I just I know I
need these in my collection I'm super
impressed with them so for the huda
beauty lip contour set do I say to
snatch it or scratch it I mean quite
clearly I am saying
snatch it snatch it up snatch it up guys
I'm not kidding I think these are so
good has anyone else tried the hoodie
Beauty liquid lipsticks do you love them
as much as I do but have you not had a
great experience I mean let us know in
the comments down below we're all
different and we all like different
types of products so let us know if you
own these what you think in the comments
down below I also
it's interesting because on the back
they do have like a little grid here and
it says Buddhist tips for the perfect
pout she says to line the lips with
trendsetter apply the trendsetter liquid
lipstick and then apply bombshell in the
center to kind of give the illusion of
like bigger lips I haven't done that yet
but I kind of do want to try it and
maybe I'll film it and see what it looks
like but that's on the back here so
that's kind of how she picks I think how
she picks like what
look what lipsticks are going together
in this type of set so again super
impressed with this $24 for the
full-size lip liner and the two mini
liquid lipsticks they are exclusive to
Sephora so I will leave them linked down
below but I've been super impressed with
this super happy with it again
trendsetter is on my lips right now I
absolutely love it so impressed with
this formula and I will definitely be
purchasing more from them so this one
definitely got an a-plus in my book so
that's going to be it for this snatch it
or scratch up video I really hope that
