today's video is so exciting for me
because I'm going to be doing my 20000 a
subscriber giveaway and I'm just so
pumped I can can't believe milestone is
here it was super super overwhelming to
see 20,000 subscribers on YouTube
channel to me that is a ton of people it
is really overwhelming I totally get
their channels out there with a hundred
thousand and 1 million subscribers but
to me 20,000 unlike me that's a big
number to think that 20,000 people
stopped by my channel and hit the
subscribe button is such an amazing
feeling and I just am so excited I'm so
grateful I've been working on this
giveaway for a while and I am just so
excited to share with you all the prizes
that I picked out that I will be giving
away to a winner just a huge thank you
to everyone who comes from a channel
watches my videos leaves a nice comment
shares them with their friends and on
social media I appreciate it so much
because we are in this together and I'm
just so incredibly thankful I love doing
giveaways I try to do them as often as I
come across all my social media channels
to show my appreciation and my love I
just really enjoy giving back and it's
really important to me that I do these
give voice as well to show my
appreciation so I have a lot of
different items here I'll first go and
through all the prices that I'm giving
away and then I will run through the
rules who can enter when it ends how to
enter and all that good stuff but
without further ado let's go ahead and
jump into the prizes so first up I have
some different skincare items here one
thing from pixie beauty this is their
peel and polish I have been using this
myself for a while and I've really
really enjoyed I've been really liking
pixie skincare also from pixie I have
their glow mist I have one of these as
well and it's one of my favorite makeup
mists and then the last thing I have
from pixie is their glow booster so this
is like an illuminating fluid that you
can wear as a highlight or you can mix
in it with your foundation then I have a
lava magic cleanser scrub and mask from
better skin I just got some one
myself as well and I have a couple items
here from define beauty so we have their
daily moisturizer with SPF also their
exfoliating cleanser with brown sugar
sweet almond and oats I've been using
this myself and then also third night
cream was Coco Malay and rice bran so
all of these skin care items will be in
the giveaway I have a couple items here
from tweezerman that will be in the
giveaway one is their must-haves I get
with a lines lighter shader and a
blending brush so you get these brushes
from Twitter Minh in addition I also
have this little like tweezer manic
slush and then inside is some tweezer
main goodies as well and then also the
Promaster eyelash curler from tweezer
Minh will also be in there and then this
is from the morale gal by Tanya crooks
it is some brow powders and then also a
brow wax so that was one to giveaway box
also and then I have a liquid eyeliner
this is from ELF and it is in the shade
charcoal I've been using their liquid
liners myself and I've really been
liking them and a couple items I have
here from number 7 I've been loving on
at number seven recently so I had a few
of their extra products I thought I
could put in here one is a blush in
damson mist and the other item from
number 7 is one of their bronzers and
this is in its golden sand I love both
the blush and the bronzer so it's really
excited to include some in the giveaway
also on to some face products I have a
little Smashbox primer as our photo
finish foundation primer I have a full
side of that guy another primer I have
is the milk makeup blur stick again
I've been really loving on this primer
lately and then another item from milk
makeup is a new item from them this is
their Mars holographic highlight stick
so it's a really pretty like pink
iridescent holographic highlighter again
I have this myself and I really do enjoy
it and then from colour-pop
I have one of their super shock cheeks I
think this one is in spoon if I'm
remembering correctly this is what it
looks like it almost looks like you'd be
a blush bronzer but it does have some
sparkle to it too so it might even be a
highlight so thing on your skin tone
will probably depend on what you use it
for and then from elf cosmetics we have
their baked highlighter and bronze
are in bronze glow from Sigma's beauty
we have one of their loose shimmer and
glitter powders and this is in the shade
bewitched one last highlight when I
asked for suggestions on my snapchat of
what you guys want to see in this
giveaway
I got multiple multiple requests who
have this so this is the Becca cosmetics
and Jaclyn hill highlight in champagne
pop but it's their special 2-year
edition but does have Jaclyn signature
over here and then kind of let the
champagne bubbles on here and then the
inside how it is pressed it's actually
pressed with like a champagne bottle too
so it's different from the regular
champagne pop that came out two years
ago so that's that could be a really fun
one to include in a 20k giveaway kind of
a celebration highlight if you will move
on into the lipstick category which is
by far the biggest category is in this
giveaway so I'll run through them real
quick from Sosa's &amp;amp; Cosmetics we have a
