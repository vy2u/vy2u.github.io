so excited for today's video because it
is going to be my back-to-school
giveaway I did this giveaway last year
around this time I went over so well and
so many people were so excited for it
and I actually didn't realize that my
channel was still during new last year
and I didn't understand that
back-to-school giveaways were a thing
that beauty channels also did wanted to
create this giveaway very similar to how
I did it last year where if you have
back-to-school supplies and then I also
have a lot of supplies in here for like
older students college students for your
dorm room that sort of thing and then I
also have just a ton of makeup beauty
and skincare that's definitely going to
be the largest area of this giveaway is
the makeup Beauty skincare because I am
a beauty channel that's what I have so
much fun buying and I also have been
getting a lot of PR as well so I was
able to I think really make the beauty
part of this giveaway super special but
I do have some of those kind of standard
back-to-school back to college giveaway
items as well to share with you guys so
I'm going to run through all the prizes
as quickly as I can
there huh my office is a disaster right
now because they're spread out and piled
all around me and we'll go over how to
enter and all of the rest of the
giveaway rules so if you would like to
see my back to school giveaway and all
the prizes that you can be winning why
don't I go ahead and get started
it's also really hard to do when I don't
have a table in front of me and
everything that's just on my floor so
it's really hard to know everything well
back-to-school lives is piled in my lap
but of course we have to start with a
book bag it so this is the book bag that
I picked out it is pink in grey and the
brand is double-dutch Club maybe that
sounds right I got it from Target I felt
like I couldn't find a lot of cute
backpacks so this is like the cutest one
that I can find but it has a lot of
compartments in here so hopefully this
will be helpful to whoever wins that I
have some school supplies we have some
pencils I love the color this kind of
turquoise pencils of course we have some
pens there breast cancer pens so I
wanted to pick those up we also have
some posted notes I cancel with my life
without post-it notes with some
different highlighters here a pink a
blue and a yellow all different forms of
little highlights there I also picked up
some different folders I got all
different colors a blast kind of a Navy
and this greenish blue and then a pink
and they all have gold polka dots on it
so those are all some folders and of
course I had to get a notebook I thought
this was super cute was the flamingos
such as a regular notebook and then I
also got a student planner or a calendar
planner for July 2017 through June 2018
I lived my life from planners so I
wanted to pick up a planner and I like
to be cute blue and pink to this one and
I'm moving on into some legs dorm or
college style prizes I would say this
one is a cork board and it says dorm
sweet dorm the letters over here so pork
board for your storm room and also that
was really funny sign that I almost kept
for myself it says hashtag hangry
literally almost got that for myself
yeah that's how it so for me I also got
this little bag here you can use it for
a variety of different things makeup or
you know if you want to put school
supplies and I totally do that and it
just says I'm very busy on it I also got
some a wireless earbuds I just thought
that these could be really helpful maybe
if you workout you're going to the gym
or you have to walk a lot between
classes you can have some a wireless
earbuds pull more items here got a
tumblr it just says yes on it I thought
that was really cute and then I also got
this stack of cups it just says hashtag
