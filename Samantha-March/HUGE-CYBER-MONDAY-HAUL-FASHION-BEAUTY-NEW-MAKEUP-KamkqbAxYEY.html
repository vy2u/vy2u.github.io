today's video is going to be my Cyber
Monday haul and I know that you're
probably thinking Samantha cyber monday
was like a decade ago
why is your haul just coming now it's
because one of my packages was super
super super delayed but I'll get into
that in the hall but it's gonna be my
haul of my Cyber Monday I do have one
Black Friday purchased to show you but
it's not very exciting but most of my
shopping I did on Cyber Monday or even
during the Cyber Monday week there was
still like deals to be had so I was
trying to get the deals and then I also
have a few items that were sent to me as
well that I thought I would show you in
this haul also if you are new here
welcome my name is Samantha I post
videos almost every single day because I
love doing this so I hope that you will
hit that subscribe button down below
also maybe the little Bell button that
will notify you directly if I post a
video but if you subscribe I hope you
will because then he'll get notified for
my future videos and I post a lot I love
to haul I love to just chat about makeup
and just show off my subscribers I think
it's a lot of fun but I know that I have
a lot of items to show you guys so why
don't we go ahead and hop into the hall
I sorry if there was a weird noise in
the intro I forgot I still had my space
heater on because it's like super cold
here and I'm wearing I'm wearing a body
suit and it's not keeping me warm but
else I should probably shut that off
it's right in front of my camera so it's
probably really noisy so it is shut off
now I'm gonna freeze so let's try to get
through this so I have a few of fashion
items that I want to show you guys first
before I happen to like the makeup and
beauty if you do not know my
sister-in-law her name is Steph she
opened up her own clothing boutique and
it is called top off clothing and I
recently started working with her as the
director of online sales and marketing
so I just kind of do the online side of
the things she does have a physical
store in Carroll Iowa and that keeps her
super busy and so she asked me to be a
part of the team and kind of work on the
online part of things and social medias
influencer marketing and all that good
stuff so I was so excited because I was
I was just like super super happy when
she even told me about the idea like she
hadn't even did anything with it yet and
I was like so super excited and it's
been very successful and so proud of her
and happy for her and
I'm excited to be a part of the team we
didn't have a Cyber Monday deal and of
course I picked up a few things myself
so I thought I would just show these
real quick so I got all like big
sweaters because that's what I'm gonna
live in I live in Iowa so big sweaters
are like my jam but one is this I don't
know how to show it the bust on camera I
wore this in my to face like first
impression white chocolate chip video
but it's like a cowl-neck sweater and
then it has some strings here it's gray
long sleeves
has pockets I think it's really fun I'm
pretty sure this one is sold out though
right now so I don't know if it's not
I'll link it down below but I just
really liked it and I thought it was
really comfortable I got a size medium
because like I said like I want like big
comfy sweaters right now and then this
is the next one I think this one is
called the Randi top I wore this in my
what will I buy it to the Too Faced
peach collection so it's just like a
grey sweater and it's long I got this
one in a small but it's still really
long and I wear it as a one-shoulder
because it kind of has like the broader
shoulders you can wear it off the
shoulder you can wear it on the shoulder
but I like to wear it with one shoulder
off again just super like comfy and warm
and I just really liked it this one
again I think this one is still in stock
so I'll leave it linked down below I
think it was the Randi top and it was
like 34 dollars I think is what it is
but this one is so comfy I just
absolutely love it but my favorite piece
that I got is this camo shirt I saw it
and was like yep I must have that I just
wore it so it's kind of messed up here
oh let me see I wore this in my hood of
beauty video my snapchat or scratch it
for who to beauty but it's just a big
camo sweater it has like the cowl neck
again as well so that's like what makes
it so hard to show because it's just
like so so strange but I got this in a
medium as well and I just love it
because it's just baked and comfy I love
the camo
like I just love it camel is really big
right now I just saw Casey Holmes
wearing something like almost identical
to this and I thought I had seen desi
wearing something
that's two so that's why I wanted to
pick it up again I think this was around
maybe like 30 for $38 or somewhere like
that so I will leave a link down below
but those are just a few things that I
got from top left during cyber monday
that I wanted to show you guys and I
just love them especially this one like
I said just my favorite piece I just
loved the camo I thought it looked
really pretty and I didn't wanna let you
guys know too that we are doing like I
think maybe like a week of deals so stay
tuned for that I'm really excited I will
leave the top left website down below or
you can also follow us on like Facebook
Twitter and Instagram and I also do
announce anything that we're doing will
top off on my snapchat as well which is
Samantha Depp March but I know we have
some exciting promos coming up around
the Christmas time so stay tuned for
that I'm really excited so yeah that is
what I wanted to show you guys from top
left so I also got a rug from TJ Maxx
but I cannot show it to you right now
and I'm really sorry about that but I
store it in my bench in my office and my
dog is currently sitting on top of it
and I just have so much going on in my
office right now with my light plugged
in and my tripod my camera at my space
heater there's a lot happening right now
and I'm afraid if I like make her get up
she's just she's sleeping right no I
just don't want to make her get up and
when she sees this rug she goes crazy so
I think it could be a bad deal but I can
insert like a photo in here of what it
looks like because this is actually what
I take my Instagram photos on so I can
show like an Instagram photo here but I
just got this from TJ Maxx on Black
Friday it was like 12 or 13 dollars or
something it wasn't super pricey but
it's just one of those like white furry
rugs it's like pretty decent in size and
that's what I've been taking like my
product photos on for Instagram and I
just thought it made a really good
background and I don't know a shared
picture but once and I got a lot of
people asking me where I got it I got it
at t.j.maxx if I can find it online I
can link it down below but it's like TJ
Maxx can sometimes have like some hidden
gems in there and so that's where I saw
someone else say that they got there so
I don't even know who it was an
influencer that I was watching on
snapchat I don't even remember who it
was honestly they're really cool I got
this rogue from TJ Maxx and I said I'm
going TJ Maxx I'm gonna get me a rug and
that's what I did so I got that one on
Black Friday as well so I thought I'd
sneak that one in here
okay so I did do some shopping at
Sephora on Cyber Monday and I was
actually able to shop the night before
because I'm a VIP bruges I can go
through this stuff pretty quickly
because you guys have probably already
seen it but I picked out the Too Faced
white chocolate chip palette which
didn't go over so well I also picked up
a Smashbox one of the new cover shot
palettes they I don't know I got
something wrong one I'm not sure what
happened I got sent the soft light but I
know all of my videos on this one are up
I'm not sure what videos are up yet if
any for the Smashbox one if I don't have
them up that are coming I just was a
little frustrated because I actually
didn't order this one and I'm not sure
what happened and I was trying to see if
I could exchange it they sold out so it
was just a mess but I was trying to wait
a little bit before I was using it to
see if I would be able to exchange it or
whatever and that didn't work out so
I'll link on my videos below on this one
and then these videos will be coming
soon if none is up yet but I'll have
like three videos on this one as well so
those videos are coming the other thing
I got during the sale was from Kat Von D
and I picked up her brightening powder
the locket brightening powder so this is
a new release from Kat Von D they're not
currently available right now but
they'll be coming back and sale but she
now has a like under-eye brightening
powder and I'm just so super excited I
got mine in Peach they have three
different shades
I chose peach I've been wearing it I've
been really testing it out so I wanted
to do a flow review video on it and so
far I've been really liking it so those
are what I purchased during the Cyber
Monday sale and then also right after
that sale we got there was like another
sale happening at Sephora where you were
emailed like a code and you were getting
a certain like dollar amount off so I'm
VI boob Rouge so we got $25 off of $50
purchase and I just thought that was a
really good steal so I wanted to I'm I
wanted to get this eyeliner for a while
it's the TARDIS double-take eyeliner so
this is what it looks like pretty fun
packaging I haven't even opened it up I
looked at it because this is one that
just came pretty recently but what it is
it's just a double and net eyeliner
one is more like a gel eyeliner and then
is a liquid liner and I've seen Nicole
Concilio talk about this quite a bit
there's the gel liner side and she says
that she really loves it like she's
saying it's one of like the best
eyeliners out there I've tried the
double-ended
liner from NYX and it didn't work at all
night just thought it was really good
game so I'm super nervous but I've been
watching Nicole's videos more lately and
she does talk about this one over and
over and over and she's using it a lot
and it looks good so I'm gonna try it
but I thought it would be a nice two and
one I recently lost my a cosmetics gel
black liner and that was my only black
liner in my collection that I had left
so I'm glad to get a gel liner with this
too and then the liquid liner hopefully
fingers crossed is good because I'm so
limited on my liquid eyeliners like for
someone who loves eyeliners so much I do
not have enough in my collection right
now so I'm curious has anyone else tried
this I'm super excited to try it out but
the other thing that I got is from Marc
Jacobs this was my thing the eyeliner
was like $24 and then this was like 28
I'm like well basically it's like if I
buy this I'm getting eyeliner free right
something along those lines
this is something that I've wanted to
get for a while and I've been holding
off because it's so friggin expensive
because it's Marc Jacobs but chocolate
he'll raves about it so just add it to
the list of what Jaclyn hill made me buy
but it is the Marc Jacobs lip gloss and
sugar sugar so this is what it looks
like and I actually do have it on my
lips right now
I put London which is a soft matte lip
cream from NYX it's a nude liquid
lipstick I put that on and then I put
the gloss on over it and I mean I just
put it on it looks really pretty so far
it's like a really light nude gloss but
it has like gold shimmer in it I think
it's gold shimmer in it I just thought
it was really pretty and she raves about
it and then I saw one of my other
friends on Instagram talking about it
and I was like okay I'm just gonna do it
now and just and just get it over with
so I did so I got the Marc Jacobs and
sugar sugar I did it I finally pulled
the trigger what do you guys think do
you have it you think I'm crazy for
spending $28 on my lip gloss you can
tell me the truth you can tell me the
truth and this was a 100-point
perk but I really want to get it I love
for say beauty I talk about first aid
beauty all the time but this is their
facial radiance intensive peel it says
to resurface smooth and right Ninh so
this is what it looks like and I was
just really anxious to try this out I've
been really loving peels lately I have
one from Juice Beauty that I really like
and first day beauty is seriously like
one of my favorite skin care brands so
when I saw this as a point perk I was
like I'm gonna get that one so that was
all the Sephora ordering that I've done
recently so moving on to a few things I
got from Ulta I wasn't sure I was really
gonna purchase anything from them but
then they have this on sale for half off
and I was like okay so this is the urban
decay naked smoky palette so it's
normally $54 I believe and it was on
sale for 27 and I was like I'm gonna
take advantage of that so I did I'm
actually not gonna keep it this will be
in an upcoming giveaway so stay tuned
for that I have gotten quite a few
eyeshadow palettes lately and I just am
NOT a huge eyes shadow junkie person so
I'm like okay I literally just got like
four eyeshadow palettes like I probably
don't need another one it was such a
good price I was like should I just get
one for myself just to have it but I had
a little bit of restraint but this one
will be in the future
giveaway I just thought it was too good
of a deal to pass up especially when you
purchase every single item for your
giveaways it's nice when things are on
sale or some sort of discount going on
because those giveaways contribute pricy
but the other thing that I wanted to get
from all type and I'm these for a while
and I was really excited to get them so
I lower has come out with new lashes I
really like the eye lower lashes I've
had the ones that they've done in
collaboration with Vegas nay and the
green climbers were some of my absolute
favorites so these are their new looks
eyelashes and I picked up the once and
gild it and I was just playing with them
the other day this is what they look
like so they are super glamorous super
full and I'm really really excited to
try this I was actually gonna wear them
today but I wanted to show them in the
video to see what they look like before
I like cut them up and start to play
with them but I'm really excited to get
these they are a little bit more pricey
than their other ones because they're
luxe whatever that means but I will link
these down below so the
are just a couple of things I got from
Ulta I did also grab this from CVS I
don't know I went to CVS one day I don't
even know what I was looking for and I
came home was a Milani metallic lip I I
don't know what happened but when the
metallic lip craze was coming out I was
watching a lot of people's videos online
that compares some videos and everyone
was saying the Milani metallic lips were
like super super great but no one could
find them they weren't at my CVS I
refused to shop at Walgreens because
that's a whole story in itself but I
miss out on a lot of things that come to
Walgreens because I'm steadfast in my
refusal to step into that place but when
I saw these at CVS I was like so wait so
I was really excited to get it this is
in the shade materialistic I wore this
in my will I buy it the Too Faced peach
collection video and I think it is mom I
don't did I just say it's in
materialistic that's what it's in the
Milani amore matte metallic lip cream
and matte too realistic I think it's
amazing shade I was super super
impressed with these like super
impressed with these I definitely want
more it was my first time trying a
metallic lip and I loved it so this was
a good one so the reason why this video
is coming so late is because my color
pop order took forever to ship out if
you guys purchased on Cyber Monday you
probably know it I mean by like Thursday
up that week when I still haven't gotten
a shipping confirmation I was like
what's going on and then Friday came
still no shipping confirmation I'm like
what like both my Sephora and Ulta
packages already came which I am a vib
Rouge and a platinum member so I've
really fast shipping but I'm still like
why isn't this even been shipped yet I
saw on their snapchat I think it was
that weekend that they're like we know
that we're late and we're sorry and you
know they were showing us all the people
that were trying to put together the
packages but I was like geez Louise this
skin a little crazy but I did make an
order from colour-pop and I did talk
about this in one of my last will I buy
up videos I talked about the peach
collection that color pop was coming out
with and this happened they were having
20% off everything and these were
included and I was like what the heck
why not
so I mentioned in my will I buy a video
but I basically like talk to myself into
buying the lips head
and I did and I bought it and then I
decided to pick up the full set which
just includes the three lippies and the
four eyeshadows and this will be in a
future giveaway I purchased it for
giveaway and then when I got it I was
like I think I'm gonna keep the
eyeshadows for myself and then I talk to
myself back out of it I was like no you
purchase it for a giveaway and what are
you going to give away just just this
like it looks better if you give away
this side so this will be in an upcoming
giveaway and I'm super excited about it
if you guys would want to see a video on
the Just Peachy ellipse it comes with
three different lip shades in instigator
screenshot and speed dial they're two
mats and one satin in here if you guys
want to see like a swatch video on it
like I can swatch it on my lips because
it's just three that really shouldn't
hurt too much so if you guys want to see
that please leave that in the comments
down below but I just thought these
shades were like my shades so I was
excited to get it and then also this was
really nice because I mean they knew
that they were super late it was very
obvious it came with a little note that
said sorry we're late xoxo color pop and
it came with two like mini lippies in
here and I think the shades were in Waco
WeHo and then Finders Keepers so I
thought that was really cool I'm not
sure yet if I'm going to keep them for
myself or if I like pop them into the
little giveaway but I don't know I kind
of want to keep them for myself just cuz
they're so small well that's an ultra
glossy lip oh wait are these dos glossy
ooh these are both glossy lips and I
haven't turned that formula yet
okay so I'll probably keep these if you
guys want to see that swatch video of
the peach collection let me know because
I can include swatches of those maybe as
well I just changed my mind it realized
they were glossy lips and I haven't
tried that formula yet so that would be
really cool to try out so that was my
order from colour-pop that's when this
video is so late but I thought that was
really cool of them to include some like
level samples in there as well as an
apology because it was very very late
but the other thing that I want to talk
about from colour-pop
this is an ultra matte lip now this was
actually sent to me from actally if you
guys aren't familiar with the website
actally it's you know an influencer
slash brand based type of website kind
of like Influenster ish but i can leave
my link down below it's a referral link
because you get like points or something
if you refer people they do have
pretty strict requirements to be able to
be involved I actually just kind of like
how to rough experience with oculi cuz
my account was removed for reasons that
I didn't think it should be removed and
I had to go through the whole spiel with
people to get my account back and it was
kind of upsetting to me but if you have
any troubles I think their customer
service is better now than it was just a
few months ago so that's good but I
finally got my actually account back and
basically if you do meet their
requirements you can request items in
their free store and then you get sent
the items and you do have to do a pretty
quick turnaround of a review on your
Instagram or YouTube
whichever account that you have linked
to it so when colour-pop was on though I
got pretty excited and they accept it to
send me you don't just get accepted like
the brand's do have to accept you and
you have to write a little note and
while why you want the product and what
you'll do to promote it and review it
and all that good stuff but I was really
excited when colour-pop said that they
were gonna send me one they sent me an
ultra matte lip and it's print perky
it's from their holiday collection so
the packaging is a little bit different
from like the regular colour-pop ultra
matte packaging I do have an Instagram
photo and review on my Instagram I can
leave it linked down below so you can
see what the shade looks like but it's a
really beautiful like rosy pink color
and I just thought it was beautiful and
I was actually really impressed with
this formula usually the colour-pop
ultra mattes aren't my favorite thing in
the whole world but I don't know if
they've changed up the formula again but
this was actually much much better than
what I've tried in the past so not
impressed me but now I'm curious to put
this up against the peach collection
that I just got because there's some
ultra mattes in there and I want to see
if it's the same type of formula because
I thought it was much much better but I
was really excited again I can leave
octel a link down below in case that you
want to check it out I say if you have
any troubles just email them and
hopefully they will get back to you so
that is my next round so another thing
that I got sent from actally I actually
just got this in the mail today it's
from dr. Brandt and it's the oxygen
facial the flash recovery mask when I
saw this I was like oh my gosh I really
hope dr. Brandt approves me for this
because I wanted to try this for so long
I think I was seeing Nicole Guerrero
talk about this like how cool is that
packaging I'm using it either tonight or
tomorrow morning I haven't
but I just got it so I'm super super
excited to review it and I just cannot
wait I just think it looks so cool so it
says it is a flash recovery oxygen mask
and apply a thin layer to damp skin rub
it in you only have to leave it on for
three to five minutes and allow oxygen
spheres to fully activate rinse
thoroughly with warm water I think I
will do an Instagram video on this like
using it so you guys can see it so it
fits up by the time this video goes up I
will go ahead and leave it linked down
below if not I'm just marched Beauty
word on Instagram and I will definitely
post sharing this because I was so so
excited to get this huge thank you to
dr. Brandt and actively for sending that
to me coz so excited to try it
I love skin care and I love masks so two
more items that were sent to me this was
from Influenster so Influenster and
actually kind of along the same things
Influenster will send you box boxes you
take surveys to see if you're a good
candidate for a box box they'll send you
one and then you have certain tasks that
you need to complete like hauling in a
youtube video reviewing it on instagram
on the influencer your website on
sephora you know things like that and
I've been with influencers almost like
since the beginning of influencer and I
really like them and I know I've
referred a lot of people to them and I
really do like them their customer
service is seeming to go downhill these
days which is making me really worried I
have contacted Influenster over 20 times
recently on an issue that I'm having no
response email the contact form Twitter
Instagram nothing so if you have issues
with Influenster I don't know what to
tell you like actively at least when I
had an issue they finally they weren't
doing well at first and then they
started to get it together influencers
gone the opposite way for me so I don't
know I've talked to a few people about
issues with Influenster and they also
don't know what's going on so it's a
little frustrating but that's okay guys
it's neither here nor there
they sent me these Giorgio Armani lip
magnets and the shades were in second
skin and 404 all I did use second skin
in my bold smokey eye video so I can
leave that link down below I haven't
used this one yet but I think I have
something in mind for it that I want to
use it soon I have some swatches on my
Instagram that I can insert over here as
well I don't know these are $38 a piece
if you buy them you can get them on the
Sephora website and they are new
Elisa's they just recently launched I
just wasn't super stoked about them I
don't know um I do have the full review
on Instagram as well but they didn't
swatch the bus they definitely look
better on the lips and they did and
swatches but it was just kind of sheer
you definitely had to build them up the
applicator was a little bit rough for me
because it almost I kept feeling like I
wasn't getting a lot of product on the
applicator so I kept having to dip it
back in I like that it has like a like a
sinner tip I guess I mean I'm holding a
products like eye candy show you but it
kind of has this like thinner tip so
that made it handy but I don't know just
something about the way that the
applicator was I just felt like I had to
constantly keep going back in there to
build the product up and I didn't love
the way that it looked on my lips and I
don't know I guess it's supposed to be
somewhat of like a hybrid lippy like
it's supposed to be sudden and then it's
supposed to be matte but over a period
of time like it dried down mad on me but
it took 30 minutes and I don't know it
just was it was interesting I'm still
testing him out and trying them out and
I still want to try out this red one and
see what I think but I wasn't super
impressed with them so far and they're
$38 which is pretty pricey but I don't
know has anyone else tried these did you
get the Box box with them what do you
think let us know in the comments down
below but I was sent these from
Influenster as well okay then I just
have one last set of items to show you
guys and then we are done so I got a PR
package in the mail from pur cosmetics
and I was so excited and just so
grateful when I got it I was like
shocked that I got it I was watching
race like glamour snaps and she was
talking about her PR mikage from Pier
and then 30 minutes later my doorbell
rang and I got the same one and I was
like I can't believe that just happened
so it was so super exciting and I'm just
so grateful and a big thank you to
appear there one of the first brands
that I've ever like really like worked
with me or sent me packages and I'm just
so grateful for it but I'm excited to
show you what they sent me sent me the
elevation palette and I just love this
packaging like oh my gosh how much fun
is that but inside is a perfecting
highlighter palette and then it also
comes with a mini brush so I was like oh
my gosh that is so cool oh my gosh this
is so beautiful so there is the
highlight palette it look
so cool I'm so excited to try this out
and then it also came with its own like
a little strobing brush as well which I
just thought was so cool I do want to do
a video using all of these items from
Pierce so be watching my channel because
I do want to make that video and then
they also sent the revolution palette
which made me really excited it's an
eyeshadow palette oh I don't know what's
going on but it actually is supposed to
come with a fully charged mascara and
it's not in here like I can see the
little spot for the mascara but it's not
actually in there but um that's okay so
we're just gonna ignore that part but
inside this is what the palette looks
like and those shades just look
beautiful so I'm so excited to play with
that that looks really pretty dang okay
so like I said I will be doing a video
using all of these items so really super
excited to get that appellate looks so
cool I'm not sure what happened to the
mascara hopefully that doesn't happen to
other people forget the revolution
palette but I just thought that one was
really neat all of these will be linked
down below as well and then they also
sent along their mascara trifecta and
I'm so excited for this so I'm no big
deal that the mascaras not in there
because this comes with three of their
like best-selling mascaras they have the
big look which is for length the fully
charged which is for volume and the
triple threat mascara which says is for
all so I'm really excited to try out
these mascaras I hear really good things
about the fully charged mascara so I am
super super excited to try these out and
then the last thing that they sent along
is their joystick which is an
exfoliating a deep Pore Cleanser
so like I said I just love skincare so
much so I am super pumped to try this
out so let's see what the packaging
looks like okay so this is what it looks
like when you take it out and then and
then you twist it off and then that is
what the product looks like so I might
put this like in my shower because I
like to do some exfoliating and masks
and stuff in the shower it's kind of
like a time saver multitasker so I was
so
sited to get these products in the mail

lot when I get packages from any company
