I'm really excited for today's video
because it is going to be a fall
giveaway video so kind of what inspired
me to do with the fall giveaway was my
back-to-school giveaway that was a
giveaway that I didn't even think I was
going to do because I wasn't sure if my
subscribers would be super interested in
a back-to-school giveaway
I acted my snapchat everybody said that
they were it was probably my most
screenshotted snapchat to date was to do
the back-to-school giveaway and like I
said it just went over so well there was
so much excitement for it and I realized
that you guys kind of like having a
giveaway that has more than just makeup
and beauty in it like you like like the
home decor and like the funny little
touches that I threw in there so I
thought when would I be able to do
something else like that and I thought
why not something kind of fall inspired
I would have some fall in here like home
decor I have some Halloween in here like
a Halloween makeup kit of course we have
makeup and beauty and skincare in there
as well but kind of the overall theme of
this giveaway is going to be fall and
I'm really excited for it I do also
really like doing the milestone
giveaways that are just like the makeup
and beauty giveaways and I'll be doing
my next milestone giveaway at 15,000
subscribers which sounds so completely
bizarre to me but we've recently hit
10,000 and thank you so much it's still
really overwhelming to see that number
when I go and look at my channel it's
still a little bit overwhelming so I'm
just so excited but stay tuned because
once we do get to 15k I have a very very
large makeup and beauty giveaway going
on that I have already been buying for
for a while now but why don't we go
ahead I will hop into this giveaway I
will show you all the prizes and stay
tuned until the end because I will go
over the rules and how to enter and all
that good stuff but let's hop into the
prizes first back I saw that Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works was having a sale on their three
wick candles and I feel like everyone
goes crazy when the sale comes including
myself and I was like I'm going to run
to Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I'm gonna get a
candle for me and B to get a candle for
my friend and oh and I should get one
for my fall giveaway
like what would be more perfect than a
fall candle for my fall giveaway so I
said something on snapchat and I said
what are your guys's favourite sense of
the candles and the overwhelming
majority I was screaming all those snaps
the overwhelming majority vote was
leaves so of course I had to get the
leaves candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works for
this giveaway I have smelled it and this
really does smell amazing I also picked
up the candle autumn which we have
burning in our kitchen right now and
that's smells amazing that's another
recommendation from you but I said to
myself whatever candle gets the most
votes that's what I'm gonna put into
this giveaway so thank you to my
snapchat fan you guys did this you voted
on leaves so the winner will be getting
the leaves candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
and I'm a little jealous so I also have
some hair cure in here for you this is
from Pantene if they're intense
hydration shampoo it looks like this
it's all wrapped up in the plastic and I
won't take that out and I believe I
received this actually like an
influencer box but I get sent so much
shampoo and conditioner there's no way I
can go through at all so I either donate
it or put it into giveaways and this one
ended up in the giveaway but I thought
intense hydration when you enter fall in
a winter and your hair just gets really
dry and you need some hydration I felt
like it went along with the fall theme
pretty well so you will receive this as
well they'll have some jewelry in here
this is from Florence scowl skowl this
is what the little bag looks like and
then inside is a bangle bracelet I just
thought it was really pretty but on is a
charming it says she believed she could
so she did so that is what it looks like
it's a really pretty gold color so this
is what the bangle looks like I just
thought this was so cute it also has a
little 2016 charm on it I absolutely
love that quote so much I it just like
it touches my heart and so I thought
this was a really really pretty bangle
so there is what it looks like so you
also get that in the giveaway too and I
will keep it in its little jewelry bag
as well and just send that along in the
box fall can also mean that our skin
starts to dry out a little bit so also
in the giveaway I'm gonna include this
from Alexa I think it's called and it's
their body souffle and the flavor is an
orange vanilla bean you're really good
things about the body souffles so I'm
excited for you to get this so the next
thing I have is just this like a little
hair tie I have this myself it's
supposed to be better than like it
almost looks to me like one of those
like old-school phone cards I supposed
to be better and like not kink up your
hair as much I used one myself but I had
a couple of them hanging around that I
haven't used so I thought I would pop
that into the giveaway as well so I also
got this beanie hat this is what it
looks like and it's in a really pretty
like burgundy color the brand is Cece
but I picked it up from top left
clothing which is my sister-in-law store
if you saw my latest clothing haul I
feature a lot of top off in there I love
these hats I think they are super cute I
have one myself and like an olive green
color and I wear it all of the time but
I think beanies and hats are like
essential for fall you got your hat you
got your boots you got your scarves you
got your olive you got your plan what
else can you need so burgundy is a
really hot color right now as well so I
picked up the burgundy one for you but I
love these I'm so excited if you guys
don't want that also when I was in top
off and kind of roaming around the store
I was like wait a second is that a
selfie stick and my sister-in-law stuff
was like yeah I'm selling selfie sticks
now - do you need one I was like I don't
cuz I got one as a gift but I was like I
throw that into my giveaway because who
doesn't ever need a selfie stick oh I
love them we use them all the time
especially like vacations or trips or
things like that like someone always
brings along the selfie stick because
they honestly come in handy I know that
they can get like made fun of people
think they're crazy but seriously they
come and hand you so much so this is a
selfie stick that you will be winning
and there's no need to charge it you
actually just plug it into your phone so
you don't have to worry about bluetooth
it works with Android and iPhone
whatever phone you have it should work
and you just plug it right in and you're
good to go so I think these are so much
fun we gotta have a selfie stick you
guys might know if you follow me on
other social media platforms as well I'm
really really into fitness I work out
every day and I just think that this is
so very important so the winner will
also be receiving an exercise ball this
is kind of heavy this is going to be a
very heavy
package to ship out between this and the
candle from Bath and Body Works like
this is gonna be a heavy box so it is an
exercise ball so it includes a foot pump
and then obviously the ball and then you
just have to actually blow up the ball
once you get it but it shouldn't be too
difficult I've done it with several of
my exercise balls as well and I think it
might actually have like yeah it says it
has a full color exercise chart so if
you you know you blow up the ball and
you're like okay now I'm not sure what
to do check the chart or you know even
go on YouTube and see what type of
exercises that you can do with this
disability ball but I use the stability
ball all the time it's great for working
out it's even great for stretching like
I just love them so I'm so excited for
someone to win the exercise Bob and I
don't know why I'm not always a huge
pillow person but for some reason around
fault like I just want like a really
cute fall inspired pillow like sitting
on my couch or on my bed or something
like that you know like last year when I
did my fall shopping had like three
pillows on my card at one time and my
husband was like we don't we don't need
that many pillows I was like we don't so
I really wanted to include a pillow in
there because I loved them myself so I
just picked one up from Target this is
what it looks like it's just a little
like decor pillow but it says home on it
and it's in kind of like a rose gold
color I just thought it was really
pretty and just like really cute you
know set on your couch or set somewhere
in your living room that sort of thing I
just thought it was cute so it was just
a little little pillow that I picked up
from Target that you'll be receiving as
well also picked up this is a like
little ceramic pumpkin I just thought it
was really cute for decor I picked a few
up for ourselves as well to like put in
our kitchen but I just thought it was
cute decor try to wrap this up really
well because it is ceramic but I just
thought these were too cute to pass up
then if you have any baking to do like
you need to take any Halloween treats
and do your work you need to make
Halloween treats for your child I picked
up a few Halloween baking cups like if
you're gonna bake some cupcakes or
muffins these are I think 75 counts of
these like little Halloween decor baking
sheets baking cups
I don't bake so I mean that's why I got
this for you I didn't pick any up for
myself as
picked up some snacks because I totally
picked these up for myself as well thank
you so much but this is from the brand
Hammond's and it says that's some more
popcorn I just thought that looked real
intriguing because I love s'mores and I
love popcorn will I love s'mores popcorn
I don't know but you're gonna get it and
we can try that together and you can let
me know what you think also I wanted to
include this in my back-to-school
giveaway and I just completely forgot so
I said I was gonna put it in my next
giveaway so it's gonna be this one it's
not really fall themed at all but it was
something that I just wanted to throw in
here is actually a copy of my latest
novel if you guys aren't aware I am a
published author of four novels I have
four books out there and it is what I do
full-time for my career and this is my
latest book it is called up to I do and
if you can see the cover that is actual
my own wedding photo on there so that is
me and my husband on the cover and
there's also a photo of us like in the
back like you can kind of make it out in
between the words but I just thought
this would be kind of fun to include as
well and I do have a few copies that
I've been laying around the house though
and meant to include it in my
back-to-school is like doing your
reading type of thing but instead I'm
gonna put it into the fall giveaway but
I really hope that you guys will enjoy
this I also did include some hand
sanitizer in here and it's the same
moment with the wrap I got it in the
back-to-school giveaway as well I just
love these I think they're super handy
and I mean you could never go wrong with
hand sanitizing no matter what season
you're in but especially follow up
because that's when the germs that
really start coming around and the colds
so got just some hand sanitizer Oh put
some skin care in here this is from
L'Oreal it's the Revitalift volume
filler daily volumizing moisturizer so
ever give away I feel like made some
skin carrying it so there you go I'm
gonna put in this little like travel
brush case it is from Real Techniques I
actually got it in I set with a couple
of brushes but I just knew that I
wouldn't use this for myself because I
have quite a few like trouble makeup
brush bags anyway so I thought I could
put it into the giveaway but this is
what the inside looks like so you can
put a few brushes here and then it also
does have a mirror and then it kind of
slips closed right there so one winner
will be receiving this as well and then
to finish it off with the beauty items
you'll always hear me saying
you can't have a giveaway without lashes
so of course I'm putting in some art
doll lashes they're some of my favorite
lashes these ones are in the style
glamour so this is what them look like
so you'll be winning these all so I'm
really excited for this this is a little
kit from benefit it's their first prize
highlighters so that's what this one
looks like and it comes with high-beam
Sunbeam and dandelion shy beam so a
little kit of highlighters but I thought
that was really fun and we need to get
our glow on in the fall these are for
your nails I received this in I think
maybe like an influencer box there are a
beauty box but because I have fake nails
I know that I'm not going to use them so
I thought it could pass them along but
it's from Cutex it's the advanced
revival nail polish remover pads so it
will remove nail polish on natural nails
and since I don't have that I figured I
would pass it along and I've included
this and like several giveaways in the
past but they are the makeup remover
wipes from Neutrogena these are my
absolute favorite makeup remover wipes I
constantly buy them and I'm kind of
starting to buy them in two packs like
the double packs because you save a
little bit of money and then I just keep
one for myself and I throw one in for
the next giveaway itself you also be
winning these okay last few items got a
lippy in here this is from NYX it's one
of their ombre lip duos I believe this
came in these summer Beauty con box and
while I was really interested in trying
out the ombre lip duo's it's like orange
and red which isn't totally my color but
it is very fall so I didn't swatch it I
did take it out and show it it's called
peaches and cream but I didn't swatch it
or use it at all on myself because right
when I saw the colors I was like you
know what I bet I could probably pass
this along as well so again this is what
it looks like so you can get the ombre
lip effective with this again you got
the orange on one side the red on the
other and it's called peaches and cream
but I just thought that would be really
interesting I just thought it would be a
really cool so I'll put that in there as
well then I thought this is really neat
I saw this at Target and I don't know if
I've ever seen anything like this before
but it is from fantasy makers by wet and
wild and it is a stencil kit for a
mesmerizing mermaid so this is what this
one looks like so it has everything in
here that you would need to basically
like create
a mermaid look on your face so you get
like an eyeshadow palette there's greens
and purples
there's sparkles there's an eyeliner pen
but then it also has like this type of
stencil which is kind of like like a
fishnet and that's usually how people
will get like the mermaid scales I
thought it was really cool I almost
found for myself I don't know if I'll do
any Halloween looks because guys I'm not
a makeup artist I don't know really how
to do makeup but I'll like Halloween
makeup and crazy things like that I
would have no idea what to do but when
you have it all in a kit like this I was
like it's actually a pretty good idea so
this could be fun if you actually wanted
to do it for Halloween or if you just
wanted to try it out and like try your
hand at it and see how it goes
I don't know I thought it was pretty
pretty cool so I just wanted to include
that in there because I thought it
combined Halloween and beauty and then
the last thing that you will be winning
in my fall giveaway is from BH Cosmetics
and Carli bybel it's the ten color
eyeshadow and for color highlight
palette I talked about this palette all
the time it's one of my favorites I
absolutely love it several tutorials
with it on Instagram and I just think
it's amazing I can't say enough good
things about it so this will also be
included in the giveaway and I hope you
are excited for it because I love it
