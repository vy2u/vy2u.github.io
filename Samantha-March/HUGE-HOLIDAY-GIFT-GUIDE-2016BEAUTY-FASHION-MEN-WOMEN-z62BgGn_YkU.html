today's video is going to be like a
holiday gift giving guide I'm so excited
this is my first one that I'm doing I
did not do one last year and I decided
that I really wanted to do one this year
as of course like so many others I am
making my list right now for everybody
that I need to get gifts or for the
upcoming holiday season and I was really
proud of myself because i purchased my
first Christmas present for someone in
October and I was like I am on it I'm
gonna be good done Christmas shopping so
early like I'm going to be so impressive
and it's now november eighth and i
haven't bought one of their christmas
present just still have that one I'm
like dang it so to get this up fairly
quickly to help give you guys ideas but
I am totally someone who watches videos
for suggestions and I even just like
Google something like what should I buy
my husband for christmas and then I like
read everybody's articles on what i
should buy so i thought because i always
look those kinds of things up that maybe
I could make my own video give my own
suggestions so I'm going to go through
suggestions for like you know Mom Dad
significant others and then of course
like makeup and beauty levers that'll be
the biggest thing so I think I'll keep
the makeup portion last and you know
that can be not only gift ideas for like
makeup lovers in your life or friends or
if you know someone who's like a vlogger
or anything like that but also maybe
some ideas for you guys what to ask for
around the holiday time because I'm kind
of the worst like I always have a huge
wish list like you know my Sephora
Lovelace is huge and all this stuff and
then my moms like what do you want for
christmas and I'm like so maybe it'll
help give you some ideas as well I hope
you're excited before my first holiday
gift giving guide and when I go ahead
and get started okay so first I want to
talk about moms mother-in-law's all that
good stuff my mom is so incredibly hard
to buy for she is so so hard to buy for
I usually just give my mom a gift card
so gift cards are great gift cards are
great for everybody I think the one idea
that i did have for moms in our lives
are like cure eggs I feel like so many
people have a Keurig and mime
mother not actually gave me a Keurig
last christmas i believe and i use the
crap out of it i absolutely love it and
they have like single ones like they're
not the big huge curing type of thing
and like what she gave me since I'm the
only one that drinks coffee in the house
my husband doesn't drink it she gave me
just like a little single guy so you
don't always have water in it and you're
just like when you're going to make your
cup of coffee you put water in a coffee
cup and then you put that into the
Machine and grab out your little cake up
and boom there you go it's smaller it's
super simple so maybe if you have a mom
mother or not even you know someone like
a friend this doesn't have to just be
for a mom obviously with all these gifts
it's a big coffee lover in your life of
like a little keyring because they're
not as expensive as the big ones they're
smaller I feel like they're very
efficient they still do a great job and
then like a pack of k-cups and you're
good to go or even if you have a
mother-in-law who has her keyring
already but you know that she's super
duper loves coffee some k-cups throw
some k cups in with her gifts great plan
so another idea for the moms in your
life could be like perfumes now my mom
doesn't really wear a lot of fragrances
but you know a lot of people do i'm
currently kind of like getting into the
fragrance cream myself as it is but one
thing that I would like look at is you
know does she always wear a certain
perfume maybe see what it is does she
need like a restock of it maybe you
could stalk her up on that there's
always a lot of great like fragrance
sets on Sephora as well they even have a
support of favorites fragrance set where
they could kind of like go through and
decide you know which one is their
favorite perfume and maybe they'll find
something that they want to purchase
like full-size in the future type of
thing I think that could be a really
great idea and like I said I'm getting
more into the fragrance game recently so
I've been kind of eyeing a couple of
assets that I've seen on sephora i can
link a few of my favorites down below
but that's a suggestion as well i feel
you can never really go wrong with like
Bath and Body Works everybody loves the
bath and body work candles I love the
bath water works candles myself candles
ours is always a good idea and I've
recently been hearing like the candles
that you plug into the wall I think are
they causing wallflowers I don't I'm not
for sure but they have they're like the
candles but there there little smaller
and you plug them in you know you guys
no one say
annalynne down below I've been hearing
that those are really good and I
actually kind of want to purchase them
myself so that could be an idea as well
and might be something that's going on
my Christmas list do so one thing that
my mom always loved so I wanted to make
sure I included it on here was a robe
like my mom is a big row where I'm not
so much myself but every once in a while
I do have a row and when I put it on it
just like reminds me of my mom my
family's military so we live apart from
each other i'm in iowa and my mom is in
alabama currently so i don't know like
it's real weird but like if i ever like
feel homesick i'll kind of like go put
on my robe which was from my mom and I
just I don't know it just kind of makes
me feel better so maybe if you have a
mom who like always likes to get a robe
game on you could get her a new rope
then the last suggestion that I want to
suggest for the moms out there is some
skincare one thing that I would
recommend is glam glow they have really
good sets they have a really good one
right now it's before I think it's $69
and you get like three or four of their
like mini masks and the glam glow masks
are amazing another one that I recommend
very often is first day beauty I think
first day beauty has fantastic skincare
and then actually the skin care that I'm
trying out right now is from juice
beauty and I got the age defy set turn
30 pretty soon here so we gotta we gotta
do something about that I got that one
at Ulta and i'll leave it link down
below but skincare set because it could
always be a good or you could you know
always make sure that you know if she
uses something in particular for skin
care and help restock on that because
skin care is not always cheap so that I
can be a good gift okay let's move on to
some of the men in our lives it's gonna
be for your father significant other
brothers but one thing that I want to
recommend is the Yeti cup I think I'm
saying that right the yanti cups are
gaining a lot of popularity I first
heard of the brand Yeti from their
coolers they like these crazy coolers
that are also crazy expensive but
they're supposed to be like the most
amazing thing as like keeping your
drinks cold like ever and then Yeti I
think then came out with these cups as
well and I actually got my husband a cup
for our past wedding anniversary and I
went to like our local shields
there was just a huge wall full of all
these yet egos and they're supposed to
be amazing and my husband actually got
how I got the idea for him was because
he bought a Yeti cub for his father
which I think for his dad's birthday he
bought him one because it's supposed to
keep hot things hot for a very long time
and keep cold things like super super
cold and my father-in-law said like in
the morning when he like put his drink
in there he had like ice cubes in there
he left it in his vehicle or something
overnight and then the next day the ice
cubes were still in there so it's
supposed to be just like amazing and
incredible they are kind of a little bit
pricey but I mean hey if it gets the job
done if they're doing anything like
traveling or anything like that it's
great to take with so I'll leave some
Yeti cups a link down below another
thing that I want to mention is
sunglasses I know sunglasses might not
seem like kind of like winter weather
type of thing but my husband really
loves like his sunglasses and he always
has the sunglasses I'm kind of the same
way I'm getting a little bit more into
sunglasses but where my husband gets his
sunglasses from is called knock around I
can leave them link down below as well
they have a lot of different sunglass
options and what he likes to do is kind
of like customize and create his own you
can do things with the lens you can do
like Matt frames I don't know he likes
to customize his and that's reason
getting his sunglasses for probably the
last two years so i thought i would
throw that out as a suggestion as well
and then the last thing that I want to
recommend for the men in our lives is
sucks I'm not kidding you guys socks my
husband loves socks I don't know what it
is but once I figured this out my life
got so much easier because my husband is
fairly hard to buy for but what how I
realized it I wanted to tell you guys
the story too because I just thought it
was very interesting so you know we're
in our late 20s now but you know 34
years ago we were all getting married at
the same time the year that we got
married I think we had like eight to ten
other weddings that year it was
absolutely crazy but you know how you
usually get gifts for your bridesmaids
and your groomsmen I'm not sure which
friend start at the trend but all of a
sudden nice dress acts were being given
as a groomsman gift and the guys were
going wild for it so it was really fun
because
groom was giving the groomsmen all like
matching socks and that's what they wore
on the wedding day usually the socks you
know incorporated the wedding color my
husband did the exact same thing for his
groomsmen and he bought his own special
socks with like so our wedding colors
had pink in him so my husband's socks
were pink and gray and he did wedding
socks for his entire groomsmen and it
just keeps going like as the weddings
are going along socks are almost in
every single one of the groomsmen gifts
and the guys love it a lot of these guys
have left the corporate jobs those are
my husband does and they wear the socks
there or even if you're going to a
wedding or you have something like you
know fancier to go to and they have to
wear their nice shoes and the nice pants
and you can have these nice socks I get
my husband's socks at Express they
usually always have some sort of deal at
express or you can find some sort of
coupon but you can get a pack of sock
for a pretty decent price and I'm not
kidding you once I figured out how
excited my husband got over sox game
changer so I wanted to throw animals in
here too because I am a dog owner I love
my dog so much her name is Aries she's a
Vizsla you can put her picture over here
in case you don't know what she looks
like if you followed me on snapchat you
see her every single day because she is
glued to my side but I thought I would
be fun to throw out something for dogs
because we are those people that get
something for our dog as like how the
holiday time but one thing that I've
been having so much fun with is mark box
we get the monthly subscription barkbox
it's just like if you have like a beauty
subscription box but every single month
they send a box and it specifically
aimed towards your dog when you sign up
for it you can select like how large
your dog is type of things that will
depend on the size of like what goes in
the box but she gets always like two
little toys in there you know like
stuffed animals are just some sort of
like toy a ball something is in there
and they also usually send a long two
bags of tea words I can't say the word
because she is right here and she knows
what that word me and social freak out
if I say it but some dog goodies are in
there as well like we have not had to
buy her dog goodies since getting the
bark boxes because they always come with
at least two bags in there it's been
crits been crazy and insane and we
absolutely love it and then usually
there's something else in there either
like a bully stick or something like
that but she loves it like its to the
now when we are opening the bark boxes
she knows and she sits there and she
waits she waits for her little animals
to come out or her like fun toy that she
gets it's so much fun we love the bark
boxes i'll leave it linked down below
i'm sure a lot of people have heard of
the barkbox because it's very popular
but it's for good reason we love getting
them this isn't really like for your pet
but like maybe you have someone in your
life that's just like a huge animal
lover I would recommend the book dogs
and their people it was actually written
by bark post who created barkbox it's
the company Bart post that's who put out
the book and they are the creators of
the bark box as well and I was recently
contacted I'm a book blogger so I was
contacted by the publishing company to
run a feature on my blog and I was able
to give away a copy of the book as well
but it's just supposed to be a really
like touching book for you know dog
owners and the special bond that we have
with our pets and it's filled with
pictures of people and their dogs and it
just seems like a lot of fun so if you
know someone who's like a crazy dog lady
like me that could be a fun suggestion
for them as well so I did want to throw
out a game because i'm seeing this game
become like pretty darn popular and
maybe you have a friend you could
purchase this for or even like a family
member maybe you do like game nights
with your family it could be kind of fun
my sister actually just shared this on
her social media the other day and she
shared videos and it looks so funny but
the game that she was playing was called
speak out where you put some sort of
like mouth guard looking contraption
thing in your mouth and you try to speak
words now i tried to look up speak out
on amazon i did find it from hasbro so
it's you know like a family friendly
game my sister has four children and
they're playing with the kids and but
I've also seen that apparently this is
also a game in like an adult version
where there's like assault words on the
cards and whatever you're saying it
looks like there's a few different
brands that have come out with something
similar to this but I'll leave speak out
down below good family family friendly
game but there are a few different
variations but i just thought it looks
super funny and it's always nice to see
like these new fun games come out so I
thought I'd throw that one in here as
well and then if you have any book
lovers in your life what do you guys
think I'm going to recommend if you're
new to my channel you probably don't
know
but what I do full time is I'm an author
I write books so definitely if you have
book lovers in your life I will leave my
Amazon page link down below in case you
want to give books for anybody so I have
recently put out a holiday novella it's
called the Christmas surprise it's only
99 cents because it's a little bit
shorter it's an mls though it's about
less than half of like what my normal
full-size novels are so it's only 99
cents on amazon but i'll link my Amazon
page down below as well I write Chiclets
I write women's fiction and I also do
have a really big giveaway going on
right now because I just released the
book November first and we were
celebrating all throughout the month of
November leading up to the holidays have
a really huge massive giveaway going on
right now so I will leave that linked in
the description box below as well so you
can find the video that has all of the
rules and explanations on there but it's
really big it's interactive it's fun I'm
having a great time with the giveaway
but i'll leave that linked in the
description box so you can check it out
definitely if you know book lover in
your life books are always great or even
something like my friend that Shannon
doesn't have a kindle I don't know how I
didn't know this about her but I just
found this out and her fiance was like
well I know what I'm getting you for
christmas a lot of times amazon will be
running feels you know Black Friday's
coming up and that sort of thing and you
can get Kindles now for pretty cheap
kindle is a good idea as well but those
are some suggestions for book lovers in
your life and then if you know you have
some fashion lovers in your life what's
better than getting them clothes
accessories things like that so my
sister-in-law Steph owns the boutique is
called top left clothing and i am the
director of online sales and marketing
for top block clothing i recently
started working with her there so I
handle the majority of like our online
sales and you know social media
promotions and things like that but I
definitely wanted to suggest at top lock
not only because do I love it and I wear
it very frequently and I think it is an
amazing store and I'm so proud of my
sister-in-law and what she has
accomplished with the store but she has
such a huge variety over there and not
only does she have clothes for women but
she also has like a little girl section
as well which i think is just freaking
adorable I don't have any kids myself
but this could be something if you're
looking for ideas for your children
maybe you have a little girl she has a
ton of different outfits over there and
she even has stuff for like little boys
like the little like onesies and things
like that that say cute things or like
have mustaches on them she's got a huge
section over there she has accessories
and shoes and bags home decor is sold
over there she just had a huge variety
on top a lot and I'm just I'm impressed
with it I wanted to throw that out there
as well because there's a lot of great
fall fashion in there right now scarves
beanies bomber jackets you name it boots
it's over there so i will leave top
bluff link down below but i also didn't
want to throw it out because throughout
the month of november we are running a
promotion basically all you need to do
is show us your fall style on instagram
upload a picture of your favorite fall
outfit your favorite fault item a
blanket scarf or whatever it is that you
love for fall share it on your Instagram

leave that link down below as well and
use the hashtag top-left fall and when

buying gifts for someone else we also do
sell gift cards or maybe you want to
stock up for yourself I'm not I wouldn't
judge you if you did that you would get
twenty percent off your entire online

that out I will leave the links to
topple off down below and that
information for the promo as well but
yes it's great for fashion lovers and
like I said there is gift cards to that
can be used online as well we do ship
within the united states so all that
information it will be down below but
for fashion lovers in your life check
out top off clothing okay so now we're
going to get into the beauty side of
things i wanted to leave this for last
because I know my videos can be pretty
long and I could probably talk about
makeup for the entire video but I wanted
to throw out some suggestions for other
people in your life as well in case
you're like me and always needing some
slick
shins so I'll throw out a couple of
things here for the makeup lovers in
your life maybe you're looking for you
as well maybe you need to give your
mom's or your mother-in-law's or your
siblings or your significant others
ideas for you as well here a couple of
my ideas that i would put on my wish
list some of the big things that like i
have on my wish list as a beauty vlogger
is like certain equipment so i have a
camera and i have a tripod but I don't
have any lighting yet and lighting is
definitely what I want to get next I can
laze link down below the lights that I'm
looking to purchase from amazon it's
from the company i think it's called
like LUMO or something along those lines
and they have a couple soft boxes I
think you can get like two soft boxes
and the stands and like all the bells
and whistles for like eighty dollars or
something like that that's not a bad
price at all and I would love to get
professional lighting I would also love
to get more like makeup storage I do not
have a vanity I've never owned a makeup
vanity in my life I have two desks in my
office and that i use and i have a huge
bookshelf and that's where i'm drawing
my makeup but a lot of makeup lovers
used I think it's like the ikea nine
drawers again i can leave a link down
below but you know maybe if you need a
suggestion for your parents or you know
maybe even a significant other if they
kind of want to like go big for you and
you need something from makeup storage
the ikea nine drawers seem to be a good
one as well and then i also wanted to
touch on sigma beauty because they just
came out with a lot of like really
fantastic sets for the holidays and i
wanted to throw out a couple of my
favorites but basically it's kind of
like packaged up some of their best
sellers in two different sets and you
can get a set for a lower price and you
would pay individually for the products
so one that they have is the copper bell
duo and you would get the e 06 liner
brush and then the Sigma wicked gel
liner I have both of these and they are
amazing for winged liner the brush is so
small and precise it's fabulous and the
Sigma gel liner is wonderful probably my
favorite gel liner to date is that Sigma
one and you can get to do together for
22 dollars which is a great value in
another set that they have is for
brushes it's their cashmere copper set
so all the brushes are coming
like instead of their regular like kind
of like black candles they have these
copper handles for the holidays but you
get the e25 one of my favorite blending
brushes the e-40 fantastic blending
brush and then also the e 45 and you can
get the set for thirty four dollars I
believe it's 43 if you purchase them all
individually but these are fantastic
brushes so this then I definitely have
my eye on as well so from Sigma they
just came out with the sig magic that's
the sig magic I keep raving about it
because it is amazing brush cleaner
makeup sponge cleaner it's fantastic
it's a hundred percent natural it is
great it could be a really good stocking
stuffer like if you have a friend or
co-worker that you know like likes to do
their makeup it's a it would be a great
gift great stocking stuffer great like
Secret Santa surprised if you drew
someone's name at work type of thing and
also Sigma I'm not a hundred percent
when this video will go up but Sigma is
having a ton of sales starting like in
the next couple days and running through
December so whenever I post this video I
will leave in the description box down
below what the sale is that Sigma is
running some days its twenty percent off
some days it's thirty percent off some
days they have a discount on sale items
some days they have a discount on like
their gadgets and they're cleaning
supplies like they're doing really
fantastic things so make sure to check
the description box because I'll have in
there the upcoming promos that Sigma is
doing because that is a good time it's a
purchase from them so Benefit Cosmetics
is one of my favorite brands and they
came up with some really really cute
holiday set so I want to touch on a
couple of my favorite here one is the
girl gone Wow best sellers set so inside
you're getting a full size they're real
mascara one of my favorite mascaras I'm
wearing it right now you get a full-size
gimme brow the benefit gimme brow is
absolute life I love mine also get a
full size of their Porefessional I
haven't used the Porefessional but so
many people rave about it that I have my
eye on it also inside you get a mini
they're real tinted primer and then a
mini Benetint cheek and lip stain I
believe it as I haven't tried those
either but people seem to really like
them and so you're getting everything is
less three full-size products that is
not a bad deal at all and then two minis
as well you can get all of that for
forty six dollars and
say it is a ninety nine dollar value so
that is a good one to look into and I
wanted to mention from benefit is the
girl o'clock rock mini bestseller set
$45 and inside you're giving 12 minis so
I think this could be fun not only to
give to a makeup lover but maybe to use
as individual stocking stuffers Oregon
Secret Santa or anything like that you
have a gift ready to go for a girlfriend
but you still like you need something
else you know like sometimes you have
that gift you're like ooh it's not quite
good enough but I don't need to do
anything too extravagant I just need a
throw a little somethin there you could
throw one of these in there keeps them
for yourself they have inside us all
minis but like they're real mascara
isn't there the dandelion is in there
they have lip gloss in there I think
they have like an eye cream in there
it's just a bunch of their mini
bestsellers and I think that one looks
like a lot of fun as well so a product
that i've recently used and really loved
i have a full video on it that i can
leave link down below is the Real
Techniques it's their diamond sponge
I've had so much fun with this diamond
sponge I think it's fantastic it's half
the price as the Beauty Blender i love
how big it is it's it's amazing i've
been loving it since i first got it it's
definitely a standout product to me so
that could be a fun one for a beauty
lover in your life or again a stocking
stuffer since a little bit of a smaller
gift I think it's really cute and it
does the job so well so I am hearing
that the two-faced sweet peach palette
is making a comeback I am hearing it
last spring a two-faced release the
sweet peach palette and people went
crazy for it and it sold out everywhere
so fast and people were mad about it and
two-phase came out and said that they
did not expect the response that they
had for the sweet peach palette and they
felt terrible that they sold out so fast
and that so many people were not able to
get their hands on it so they say it's
coming back for the holiday season at
the time then I'm filming I don't have
any sort of exact release date or if
that is even still true but apparently
it's still coming but if the sweet peach
pilot really is coming back in stock
this is a great gift idea because people
are going crazy for it or if you need to
give a makeup suggestion the sweet peach
palette it's forty nine dollars I own
the palette it's one of my favorites
hands down people went crazy for this
palette for a very good reason
I absolutely love the shadows in it I'm
so excited that two-faced decided that
they were going to come back with it
because it made it to happen and then of
course for makeup and beauty lovers in
your life a gift card to Alta a gift
card to sephora those are the ways to
say i love you too makeup and beauty
lovers in your life give them a gift
card let them do their own thing it's
fabulous it's great so sephora and ulta
are like our big motherships we
absolutely love them so if you are
seriously stumped for the makeup and
beauty lovers in your life go for a gift
card and they will be so appreciative
all right guys that's going to be it's a
for my holiday gift giving guide I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video remember that if you do any of
your shopping online do not forget to
use ebates basically all that happens is
that you get cash back for your
purchases uses will send you either a
check in the mail or just direct deposit
into your paypal account and boom now
you get to go shopping again and use
your ebates and get more cash back I
mean it's a cycle it's a cycle you guys
so don't forget to use ebates if you're
shopping online it's a great way to save
some money I only view bates link down
below in case you don't have it make
sure you get signed up for it please and
thank you but I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this I wanted to kind of
hit a lot of different you know people
and just give a lot of suggestions if
you guys like this video let me know
because I feel like I could definitely
do a part 2 because I just wanted to
keep each category kind of small so I
could get through as many as I can
without making this a 30 minute video
because I know my videos are all really
long so if you wanted to see like a part
2 or anything like that or if you want
to see just focused on makeup and beauty
are just focused on other people in your
life just leave me some comments down
below and let me know what you want as
we approach the holiday season I'm
completely open to your suggestions but
I just thought this would be a fun one
to do because they are the type of
videos that I love as well so I figured
why not make one I will leave everything
