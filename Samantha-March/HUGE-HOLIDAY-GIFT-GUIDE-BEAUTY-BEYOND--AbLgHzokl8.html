today's video is going to be a Holiday
Gift Guide for for a whole bunch whole
bunch of people I have categories for of
course and makeup and beauty but I also
have categories for like Fitness fashion
different men and women in your life
your pets all kinds of things I saw this
is probably going to be a bit of a
longer video but a Holiday Gift Guide
was super highly requested as of lately
so I wanted to get up as quickly as I
could I didn't want to do anything
last-minute and I know Black Friday and
Cyber Monday is a just around the corner
so I thought I could give you guys some
ideas if you are looking for gifts to
buy for your friends and your loved ones
so if you are ready to hop into my
holiday 2017 gift guide when we go ahead
and jump into it I like I said I have
front Beck lists to go through so let's
just dive in I'm gonna start off with
the pet category and I'll try to run
through each thing it just as quickly as
I can just touch on it briefly since I
know I have so much to get through
makeup and beauty is going to be last
because I know that will be the longest
and I'm just going to kind of see how
long we've already been running to
decide how many things I'm going to
mention in that category but to start
off with pets I am a dog owner myself
and one thing that I absolutely love to
get for Aries is the bark box I will
have everything that I can
linked it down below but we've been
getting bark box for Aries for probably
at least close to a year and it is so
much fun it's a monthly subscription
just like you would have like a makeup
box but it's for your pets there are
different boxes that you can get we get
one of the cheaper options but honestly
it is still you get two toys on there
two bags of treats and one like bigger
treats of like a bully stick or
something like that usually comes with
it and that is perfect for us like that
is all that we need loves it and she
knows when her bark box has arrived and
she is so excited she's always playing
with her toys and we have not purchased
a bag of treats since signing up for
barkbox because like I said you get two
bags in there so it's been fantastic we
love bark box another item if you do
have a dog and if you have a dog who
particularly loves like being under
blankets and such I would recommend the
snoozer I believe is the proper name for
them we call them the cave you guys
follow me on snapchat you always see
photos
of Aries in her cave I can't actually
hold it up cuz it's so huge but I'll
turn it into sort of photo here so you
can see what I'm talking about maybe
I'll put it in a photo of areas in her
cave but it is freaking awesome I mean
it's like what it says it's like a cave
a for a dog and Aries is someone who
like that's what she loves she's always
under the blankets and she loves her
cave she is in it all the time we got
ours off Amazon so that's where I'll
link it down below again the price it
varies by the size that you get Aries is
she goes between 50 and 60 pounds she is
a bitch Allah and I believe that we got
people large for her and she fits in
there so well I mean honestly another
dog can fit in there but she is pretty
long and I think that she fits in there
great so we love it
she loves it she's in there all the time
it was such a wonderful purchase and one
last thing that I want to recommend for
pet owners and this can be four dogs and
four cats my friend of Culver de Cutler
started a business called Bailey's
mission and she has a bunch of different
like apparel on there that you can
purchase I was actually just wearing her
shirt one of the shirts in my Friday
video it was a tutorial so you can quite
see the full shirt but I'll insert a
photo of it here it says I just want to
like eat tacos drink margaritas and pet
my dog which is like basically my life
but she has items on there for dog and
cat owners so it can definitely be
something that to look into and not only
are you supporting a girl boss you know
YouTube entrepreneur and also a part of
the proceeds it does go back to
supporting shelters which i think is
amazing she does really cool work so I
will have Bailey's mission list it down
below and I definitely think you should
check them out gonna move over to some
men in your life this can be your spouse
your boyfriend your father your brother
whatever it is one thing that I love to
get my husband like really no matter
what occasion it is is socks and I'm
talking like the nice kind of I think
it's a cult argyle socks
I get his from Express and then in all
different colors and honestly our group
of friends we have a lot of corporate
workers especially among the vent in our
group of friends but they all love these
socks so much that I don't even it
started I think before our wedding the
the guys would get their groomsmen gifts
socks and then they would all have
matching socks in the wedding and their
tuxes we did it everyone else has done
it and all the guys just freaking love
them I mean they have all different
color
socks so does much and whenever a Paris
room like he has a hole in it I like
markdown what color it is because I
might gif okay I'll replace those socks
for you
they love socks it's the craziest thing
so if you have someone who works
corporate or maybe goes to a lot of
events or maybe you know you have like a
lot of weddings coming up or something
where your guys gonna have to be
dressing up get them some socks I get
them from Express a lot of times there's
like you know a 30% discount here or a
buy one get one half off there that's
when I suck up on the socks and he
really enjoys them which is also someone
who really enjoys watches and he didn't
always but then what then they'll pass
like for like three years or so like all
of a sudden he's been on this watch kick
and I also have the swatch so this could
be for a female in your life as well
this one is a woman's watch but this is
a watch from yard it's what my watch
looks like and you've probably seen me
wearing it and several of my videos I
think it's really cool cuz it's a wooden
watch and my husband also does
woodworking on the side teeth loves to
woodwork other I was gonna say something
that was kind of real dirty but he does
a lot of woodworking and he makes a lot
of really cool things for us and for
other people too so when I saw these
wood watches I just immediately thought
of him and I thought it would be so
perfect for them
the j√∂rg watches are now on Amazon so I
will have them linked there below but I
love this watch whenever I wear it I get
so many compliments but especially from
men men complement this watch more than
the women do which i think is so funny
but I think it's something to do with
like the wood factor so I don't know if
this screams like your guy of course
this is a woman's watch but if this
screams your guy I would check them out
or if you're looking you know for a
female in your life to they do have
women's watches as well or you could mix
and match them either way that you like
it so I did want to mention this watch
because it is one of my faves I want to
move on to my mom category mother-in-law
category sister category again a lot of
these gifts can be for a lot of
different people in your life I just
want to take about some fun ideas as we
enter the holiday time but for mothers
but I mentioned perfume I always think
perfume is a really good gift especially
for moms or mother-in-law's or even like
some of your friends in your life if
they're big perfume lover thing that I
would recommend is Sephora has the
perfume a sampler side I mean I'm gonna
mention the Sephora favorites down the
road here a little bit but they also
have the the perfume sampler status so
if maybe you want to give some
perfume but you don't know which one
what scent they would like you given to
the sampler side that could be a really
cool gift option up so they could try
out a bunch of different ones and maybe
find their favorites or I have two here
that I could recommend this one is a
from Kenzo it's just called the Uzi
Lumiere I think is what it's called it
is available at Sephora I believe it's
available at like Macy's as well this is
one of my all-time a favorite scents and
sometimes I just spray it in my office
like even if I'm not going anywhere I
just spray it because it just makes me
happy but I just feel like it's like
boost my office up I really enjoy it I
like really light cents and this one is
very light and very floral at the same
time so that's a scent that I gravitate
towards and then the other one that I've
really been loving I think I actually
mentioned this in a favorites video a
couple of months ago but this is from
define me and the scent is in delphine
you can get these on Ulta so I will have
it linked down below it reminds me a
little bit of the Kenzo but with a hint
of something different I mean I can't
describe perfume to save my life but
define me has a bunch of different
scents on there as well and they're a
really cool company I would just suggest
checking it them out but those are two
perfect ideas if you know if you have
perfume lovers in your life another
option that I wanted to mention is
perhaps a cleaning service this is
something that I've actually wanted to
do for myself for such a long time but I
always feel really guilty because I do
work from home so I'm like how can I not
balance working from home with keeping
my house clean especially when it's just
me my husband and a dog we don't even
have any children like I need to get it
together but I've always been interested
in a cleaning service so maybe if your
mom is someone who does work full time
or you know someone who's just always
really busy maybe their work multiple
jobs or they have a lot of kids and you
know like housework is just stressful
regardless I'll look into a cleaning
service I've actually been doing it
myself lately and they have so many
different options out there and
different packages out there and it can
really not break the bank if you can try
to figure out you know maybe it's only
one area or two areas of the house that
really need the attention and they can
handle everything else I just think
that's pretty cool so maybe it's an
option for someone in your life to do
something a little bit nice for them to
kind of take some of the stress or
pressure off or when they come home from
their job and they're so stressed and
then they have all this cleaning that
they have to do as well maybe
check out a cleaning service the last
thing that I want to recommend for moms
is skincare I actually am going to have
a full skincare section so I will have
some skincare options over there but I
think skincare is always really good for
moms as well I know when my mom was here
visiting me we are a military family so
I'm an Iowa my mom my sister and her
whole family are in Alabama but my mom
was here a few months back visiting me
and I know she took a whole bunch of
skin care home with her she was like
this one and this one and this one I was
like you take it mom you got it skin
care is always a really great option so
stay tuned I'll have some specific skin
care products to recommend coming up so
moving on to some of fashion lovers in
your life I recently discovered a
Windsor or wins in restore I will have
their website linked it down below
I did a clothing haul pretty recently
with quite a few of their items and I
loved everything that I've got and I've
already got a bunch more in my cart or
the next time I make a clothing purchase
a really cute really trendy stuff and I
thought the prices weren't too bad at
all so I would check out Windsor if you
know someone who loves a sunnies I would
recommend kee Australia these are I
believe these are called the Midnight
Runners sunglasses and they are
ginormous but they make me feel like a
bus okay that's how they make me feel
they have a small head so it's hard for
me to pull off sunglasses a lot of
different styles and there they are a
little bit more pricey but they do send
out newsletters with like 10% off I've
even seen 20% off and their newsletters
and such so I would recommend standing
up for the newsletters if you have
anyone that you think would enjoy some
Sunny's and then also I would recommend
this is gonna kind of push us over into
the next one too but if you have someone
who's also a fitness lover in your life
I would check out and getting them
clothing I mean of course you can always
ask for their suggestions but I'm
someone who I kind of let my clothes
motivate me like when I have the cute
workout clothes I just feel more
motivated to work out even though I only
work out in my home I don't actually go
to a gym and nobody else sees me if I
still feel better when I'm wearing a
cute workout clothes so that can always
be an option for me I personally have
been wanting to try the brand
gym shark I've been kind of eyeing them
lately he's anybody tried gym shark
because they are what I'm feeling so if
you're like asking it for some of their
pieces of for Christmas as well kind of
bit of a sneak peak of my Christmas list
but definitely workout clothing can be
good but then it's switching over to a
fitness
if you have someone who's wanting it to
get more into fitness you could always
think about something like a gym
membership or you know signing them up
for a certain amount of classes I know
we have a lot of like we have a yoga
studio right by us and they offer you
know certain packages and you can buy
packages for someone else in your life
or I use the workout site Crocker
it is a membership based website but
then once you have your membership which
i think it's like twenty dollars a month
I'm pretty sure you get just a ton I
mean a ton of different videos all these
different types of workouts it's what I
do every single day if you follow me on
snapchat I always share what my workout
of the day is and it's always coming
from Crocker they have yoga in there
they have cardio kickboxing they have
recipes on there I mean they just have
basically everything that you would want
for working out and all different levels
as well they also do a lot of different
challenges I basically join every single
challenge because I just think it's a
fun way to challenge myself find new
workouts there are so many trainers and
they're that I love and you can do a
free trial if you'd want to see it and
make sure it works for you but if you're
someone like me who I don't like going
to the gym I don't feel like I have time
to drive to a gym I just want to do it
from home then that could be a good
option and then also just getting them
equipment such as like a yoga mat I've
been gifted a yoga mat for Christmas
which is so helpful to me
I've also been gifted dumbbells whatever
anybody needs for their home gym I have
like resistance bands I have two
different pairs of them I have a jump
rope I have a what's the big ball called
the kettlebell I have that and a lot of
those for gifts over time so I've just
kind of been like slowly piecing my home
gym together so I really have no reason
to ever have to leave or go anywhere
else for my workout I can do it all from
home so those can be some really good
gift ideas too I'm going to move on to a
few more like a lifestyle type of pieces
if you will this is just kind of a bunch
of different things thrown together but
if you know anybody in your life who is
a book lover you could give them
something like a Kindle if they like to
read eBooks a Kindle is a great option
and ebooks are a lot cheaper than
physically buying the print books which
as a published author that always makes
me really sad to say as we see print
books like slowly slowly becoming less
and less but ebooks are a really good
option to then like
said I am a published author so if
you're looking for any books it's a gift
of course I have to give myself a
shameless self-promotion plug hello hi
books a questionable friendship it was a
best-seller on Amazon about 2 years ago
I think it was I got the nice little
bestseller tag next to it which was
really exciting up to I do this is a
book about a wedding of course and this
is actually made my husband's personal
wedding photo on the front which was a
lot of fun it has nothing to do with our
wedding but our wedding photo is on the
front and this one is my most recent and
novel it is called defining her all of
my books print books and eBooks can be
found on Amazon so those will be linked
down below I also do have a book blog it
is called chiclet plus com I'll have
that link down below I do a ton of book
reviews over there so if you are looking
for something specific I have a bunch of
different categories over there I have
my favorite books over there that I've
given five star reviews to so you can
check that out if you are looking for
some more book recommendations another
idea for book lovers is audible so
audible is audiobooks so if you have
someone who often like commutes whether
it's like a subway a train are they just
have a long car ride to work evil has a
ton of different options every single
genre on there for books I believe they
have podcasts as well
I always listen to an audiobook
especially during the summer with warmer
weather is when areas and I go for walks
I always just listen to an audiobook
while we're out walking or if I'm
cleaning I always have an audiobook on
Livan ball it's a service that I've been
using for probably two years or so and I
just think it's a great idea I always
loved the idea of gifting memories to of
verses suggests and materialistic things
which of course those are great as well
but I love ideas such as buying like
concert tickets me and my husband go to
concerts all the time games if you live
somewhere but like a professional
sporting event is happening or you can
you know drive somewhere I mean I would
check things like Groupon they always
have good deals out there and then also
they have the Groupon experiences or
Groupon travel or something like that
for more of these like memory making
ideas I wanted to add in a little
youtuber category here as well I feel
like oh maybe a lot of people who watch
this video could be a youtuber or an
aspiring youtuber for whatever different
category it is that you are in but
there's a lot of good gifts that you
could give someone or you could ask for
you know some of these gift ideas as
well are ideas that you could put on
your
because I really struggle sometimes
coming up with an ideas to give like my
mom or my husband or whoever it may be
to give gift ideas to me
so here are some that I would recommend
for a youtuber I mean definitely the
first one is a camera I have the sony a
5100 I will leave it link down below
here most definitely one of the best
things ever I mean you can film off your
phone and that's definitely how I
started but I feel like things really
you know upgrade it one at once I got my
professional camera also lighting I
first started with lighting I've got two
soft boxes off of Amazon I think it was
like $70 for two soft boxes and those
really made a huge difference especially
in the wintertime that last year when it
would get so dark so fast I would have
these soft boxes to help kind of light
up my room and then also moved on to the
diva ring light so I'll have that linked
to the diva ring light has saved me I
basically only use that unless I'm
filming like in the absolute pitch dark
I'll put one of the soft boxes behind me
but otherwise the diva ring light is
amazing anything like a mirror even if
it's like a vanity mirror a light-up
vanity mirror those can be super helpful
for me I actually asked for Christmas
from my mom for a full-length mirror I
would really love to start doing more
like outfits of the day and stuff on
Instagram but it is so hard to take the
photos myself so that's something that I
asked for for Christmas that I think
would be really helpful so we're gonna
move over to skincare and then finish
off with makeup and beauty products what
I want to do for this video is recommend
definitely a lot of sets holiday sets
holiday kids and that sort of thing
because otherwise if I kind of didn't
put a cap on it we could be here forever
and we're already gonna be here forever
so this set here is from la Hendrickson
this is called their three glowing
scrubs but the screen definitely has a
ton of different assets out right now to
kind of for whatever it is that you
would want for someone or if you'd want
to suggest for yourself
I already dipped into it the middle one
here which is called the poor balance
facial sono scrub is currently in my
shower and I've already started using it
so that could be a good idea another one
again this is from the sephora favorites
line they have so many different options
in there I've already mentioned perfume
but they have the beauty sleep so they
have a bunch of different really cool
items in here glam glow Kate Somerville
origins Hendrickson is in here as well
so that's awesome this set got my
attention this is from that belief they
have there
I'm in here which is amazing the
Hungarian water essence which I love and
then also the Amoy stir icing a bomb so
that's another really good skincare set
I just got this a set sent to me but I
thought it was super cute so I thought
I'd mention it I use a ton of
Dermalogica products and I'm
recommending them quite a bit so this is
the age smart anti-aging a power trio it
says it's $58 and an 88 50 value you get
three different products in here the
daily super Folie int at the recovery
mask and the skin recovery I think that
is like the moisturizer and then also
like how how cute is this little
ornament with some skincare in it this
has their vital replenish oil in there
I'm Dermalogica is another one that they
have a lot of different sets available
so I'll have some dermatological links
below also number seven is one of my
favorite skincare brands these ones are
a little bit more affordable and you can
find the skincare at Ulta they have a
bunch of different sets out as well so
they will also be listed down below
Cosmetics is another brand that I would
check out for skincare says I loved her
makeup but I also really enjoyed their
skincare and I've noticed they have a
bunch of different kits out right now so
I will have some chart listed down below
if you know someone like me who loves
sheet masks I have two different brands
that I would recommend this one is a
pathology I use pathology a ton and I
really enjoyed them and then the other
brand that I really love is a bio belt I
have so many of both the pathology and
the bio belshi masks but I just really
enjoyed them so if you know someone who
loved sheet masks I would recommend both
of those brands if the let's hop over to
some makeup suggestions alright let's
get into it
so of course I like I've been mentioning
throughout the Sephora favorites
definitely check out the support
favorite says I mean not only do they
have the perfume in the skincare they
have hair care in there they have all
about like highlighting skin and there
they have a amazing looking lip set in
there at mascara they have a ton of
different options and they are a really
good value either as a gift or for
stocking stuffers I would also check out
brush sets
I really recommend a Sigma Beauty I have
so many of their makeup brushes and I
use them all the time
Sigma has some amazing sets out right
now not only with their brushes but
their brush care cleaners they also have
makeup sets right now so I will have
some Sigma links down below also
recommend checking out Tarte I mentioned
them from skincare but they are coming
out with a ton especially a holiday
related sets right now and not only
a cup says and skincare sets but they
also have a brush sets to which i think
is fantastic if you know someone who
loves glitter I would recommend they
steal a set I love the Stila glitters
there are sets of like three five I
think even more of them both at Sephora
and Altos if you know a glitter lover I
would check out the Stila also I found a
set on the Ulta website from Estee
Lauder it comes with their heat wave
highlight which is like such a
well-known and loved highlight and then
also a lipstick for $45 I just was
browsing the Ulta website getting gift
ideas the other day and that one popped
out at me and I was like that's pretty
cool I also do want to say real quickly
this is kind of off topic but the gift
there was actually supposed to be a
collaboration what a friend of mine we
had to put our collab on hold because
she's actually like out of town on a
work trip and wouldn't be able to film
so we're gonna do something else a
little bit later but my gift guide
portion was going to be high end so I've
already been working on this for quite
some time so that's why most of my items
are high-end I did go through and try to
find some drugstore items put in there
but honestly drugstores getting so
expensive anyway it's kind of annoying
me but if you're noticing a lot of
high-end in here it's because that is
originally what this video was supposed
to be so I do apologize for that but I
just wanted to throw that in there so
pur cosmetics recently launched a bunch
of different sets in the appear quick
Pro collection they're all available now
at pur cosmetics Ulta and poles but I
wanted to show off some of them so this
is the first one here so this is the
quick Pro lips you get a three-piece and
nude collection and has the gloss and
birthday suit I lipstick and stripped
and then and the liner in and naked and
then there is also a highlighter kit
here that I thought was pretty cool and
then actually a highlight palette which
I'm so excited to to dip into I just
very recently got this one and haven't
even had time to like play with it or
open it or anything but they came out
with a lot of different sets again
available up here Alta and Kohl's even
skincare more lip products by products
things like that so I will have some
links to appear down below but these can
make really good holiday gifts or even
stocking stuffers few items that I found
on the drugstore side of the Ulta
website that I thought were pretty cool
especially because I feel like these are
brands that I don't always hear a ton
about but one is from Catrice cosmetics
they have a couple different holiday
bundles but for
that come with an eyeshadow palette one
comes with a rocket or mascara which I
highly recommend one of my favorite
mascaras comes with a blush and then
also a lipstick and a lip pencil so I
thought that was pretty cool and then
also essence is another brand that I
think is like a gem at the drugstore
that I don't hear enough about I saw
that they have a lash princess at master
mascara holiday kit for $13 I'm highly
considering that one because everyone
always recommends to me the lash
princess and mascara they also have
holiday sets on there too so I will
leave some of those linked down below
because they have some sets with it
especially the highlights in there the
essence pure nude highlight I absolutely
love so I will have a couple links to a
Catrice and also essence in the
description box so those are a couple
sets and bundles and holiday kids and
then now I want to recommend a few
eyeshadow palettes that I think would
make someone really happy if you gifted
these to them on the holiday time so
some eyeshadow palettes that I would
recommend for makeup lovers in your life
or to ask for yourself one would be at
the Kat Von D st. Center eyeshadow
palette I do have a review on this
palette and I absolutely love it I think
it would make a great gift idea another
one that came out for the holiday times
is the Urban Decay heavy metal eyes
shadow palette this one would be great
if you have a shimmer lover in your life
it is an all shimmer palette and I think
it is super fun again can make a really
great gift idea I know this one is
pretty popular around the holiday time
it's the new release from Tarte this is
the Tarte toasted palette it is actually
what I have on my eyes today and I did
use it in a first impressions video that
should already be up should have been
Friday's video also from Tarte I would
recommend the clay play palette this is
such a nice little palette especially to
travel with it has matte neutral shadows
and then also some face powders as well
and also color pop is a really great
affordable option I've really been into
the new color pop a pressed eyeshadows
different from their super shock shadows
that they originally released these
pressed a shadows are so good
I definitely want to get more of their
eyeshadow palettes because I've been
really impressed with those and color
pop is really affordable moving on to a
some face and palettes that I would
recommend I have the Tarte baked blush
book 3 and I seriously keep dipping into
it I think it's pretty incredible it has
some great blushes in here and also a
highlight tart also does have other
blush app pallets of
I think this one was only available on
the Tarte website but they have other
blush books and then I know they have a
blush quad available as well at like
Sephora and Ulta highly recommend the
Tarte blushes I think they are fantastic
it also recommend the Becca a pray ski
glow a face palette I have been loving
on this palette so much it gets six
really nice shades in here blush bronzer
and highlight options one of my
favorites I cannot stop wearing it I
would also recommend the urban decay
highlights they did just release a new
highlight palette they have a previous
highlight palette as well which are $34
compared to their single highlights
which are 26 highly recommend checking
into those I have them in my cart right
now at Ulta myself I do also have the
Kevin o Kwan contour books who recommend
I recommended this many times over it's
one of my favorites I'm gonna Quan a
sculpting powder is so fabulous you get
that in this book you get cream options
and also eyeshadow options and a mirror
so it's really good to travel with to a
highlight palette that I love so much
highly would recommend it's really a
while ago but I still love it is these
Smashbox and Casey Holmes spotlight
palettes I have mine in Pearl there is a
second option as well I said you can
highlight palette this comes everywhere
with me
and then an affordable option that I
really really enjoy is from a flower
beauty this is what the face palette
looks like it is called the lift and
sculpt contouring palette in medium to
deep so you have a bronzer shade and
then also a blush and a highlight all
three options in here are absolutely
awesome I would highly recommend this
one as well and to finish off with some
lip products that I would recommend
I love the huda beauty lipsticks I'm
wearing one from her nude lip collection
today you get four minutes on the
Sephora site for $33 which I do not
think is bad at all there's a nude set
there's also red and pinks and browns so
if you have a lipstick lover in your
life I feel like mini lipstick sets are
just the way to go I would also
recommend dose of colors I actually have
a dose of colors a kit in my cart right
now they just released a new two liquid
lipstick set and then also a red a
liquid lipstick said and I have the nude
one in my car too right now at Ulta I'm
really excited about that I would also
recommend at the NYX liquid suede they
have a set on Ulta that I found that I
will have listed down below I love the
NYX liquid suede lipsticks and they have
some real
fun colors and then also more of your
neutral everyday colors and there too
but I've really enjoyed that formula I
would also recommend the Urban Decay
lipsticks and I know they have a little
vices asset right now with some mini
lipsticks in there for a good price so I
will have that one listed down there and
then I also noticed that Oprah has quite
a few sets on the Ulta website as well
of their different liquid lipsticks and
that's one of my favorite formulas of
the year I've been wearing the Oprah
lipsticks so much and I now own like
seven or eight of the lipsticks one last
thing I wanted to mention I noticed on
the lttle website that Mac has on there
what's called Mac minis I know that they
have a mini-stroke cream which made it
into my Ulta card as well they have a
mini mac fix+ and they have lipsticks on
there too so they're just mini sizes for
a bit of a more affordable option so if
you have someone who really likes mac or
maybe someone who wants to get into Mac
you can get them the smaller option as
well or they could make good stocking
stuffers but after that that is going to
do it for my holiday 2017 gift guide
