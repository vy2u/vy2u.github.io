today's video is going to be a big ol
makeup haul I'm so excited for this I
have made purchases from Sephora and
Ulta and Sigma and then I also have a
few PR items in here that I thought I
would show you and show you guys what
I've been sent I'm really excited for
this I feel like I haven't done a haul
in a really long time but if you'd like
to see my latest collective of makeup
haul
please keep watching so I made a
purchase from Ulta and I was excited
because I had a 20% off coupon and
included prestige brands so I was like
yes please the first thing that I picked
up is the lorac Pro I love brunch
palette I do have a video I'm doing like
my first impressions and swatches and a
demo with this palette I also am going
to be doing a full face using new
high-end makeup coming out shortly I'm
going to be filming that in the next
couple days and I will be using this
palette as an eyeshadow palette I have a
demo in my first video I have a handful
of demos on my Instagram which is March
Beauty word if you want to see the
palette in action this palette is
getting a lot of mixed reviews and I
would say a lot of negative reviews it's
definitely a pastel palette the shades
are pastel they are light some of them
are not great some of them are not
pigmented some of them are beautiful and
pigmented and look amazing on the eyes
I'm glad that I got it at the 20% off
because it was $44 it did come with a
double in the brush and it did come with
an eyeshadow primer but I'm still glad
that I got mine at the 20% off because
I'm not sure this is worth the full $44
in my opinion just because some of the
shades really don't work but the shades
that do work are really really beautiful
avocado toast and blueberry scone are
some of my favorites I really like hot
sauce I like sorbet
I like mimosa I like sundae Funday
gluten-free is beautiful moonlight is
really pretty and I think pancakes is a
pretty color too so there are definitely
shades in here that I like if you like
to create
pastel looks or you want spring pastel
colors I think this is a nice palette
but I know it's been getting a lot of
mixed feedback but I still really enjoy
it I'm not going to
returning it and I've been really loving
on the pastel looks that I've been
getting but happy I got my 20% off with
this but that was kind of my main reason
for my Ulta order was to pick up this
palette and then another big reason that
I ordered from Ulta and I actually
weighed it and I was kind of freaking
out because I knew my coupon was going
to expire I wanted the brunch palette
but I also really wanted the hoola
kwikki contour stick from benefit I
waited a few days extra and this finally
hit the website and I was so happy so I
got it so I got this with the 20% off as
well I was so excited for this I'm super
into cream contouring right now like the
hoola bronzer from benefit I've had it
for a very long time it's one of my
favorite bronzers and when I saw that
they were coming out with the quickie
contour stick I was like that is for me
I am going to need this I put this in a
will I buy it I said I was gonna buy it
I did buy it and I'm really really happy
with it again I will put this in my full
face high end so you can see it kind of
in action when I do that makeup tutorial
I've been using this a ton on Instagram
so again a march Beauty word I do a
tutorial almost every single day on
Instagram and I've been using this a lot
so you can see it in action I think it's
gorgeous I have it on right now and that
is what it looks like I think it's
beautiful they do only have one shade
it's kind of the same as like the hoola
bronzer how they only had the one shade
for a while they did just come out with
the hoola light but this is only
available in one shade it's kind of a
warm tone for a contour but for me
sometimes contour and bronzing can kind
of like all just mix together and I just
like being bronzed and when I wear this
and then I also have a bronzer people
are like oh my gosh you look so bronze
like you look like have you been
self-tanning like what are you wearing
what is your bronzer and I've been
getting that a lot lately when I've been
doing this Anna bronzer and I love the
bronze looks and I've been self-tanning
lately but not self-tanning my face so
I'm trying to like even everything out
so this has really come in handy but I
love it I don't know if I would say it's
great for contouring but I think it is a
really pretty cream bronzer as
well but again it's going to depend on
what your skin tone is and what it is
that you're looking for since it is only
available in the one shade and although
I didn't say this is $28 that I also
show you a PR because this has been on
my lap and kind of difficult to maneuver
but irresistible me sent me a package
irresistible me is who I wear for hair
extensions I do have a hair extension
video I can leave a link down below I
don't have my extensions in today but
that is who I wear for hair extensions I
have two different sets from them and I
really enjoy them and they sent me this
guy and I was like what is this you
unroll it it looks like this and
everything in here is a different type
of wand you have this part then they
have all different types of things and
you just screw it on like that so I just
think this is super cool I don't have
anything like this and here's like a
little one and again it's super easy to
just click in place but I'm super
excited about it thought I'd share it
with you I'll leave it linked down below
as well with my hair extension video in
case you guys are interested in hair
extensions or you're looking for new
curling wands or anything like that this
is a sponsored video nobody's asked me
to include any of these items and I'm
talking about but I just got this in the
mail and I just thought it was so cool
so like thank you to irresistible me and
I am excited to try this out
so I also made a purchase from Sephora
and the main thing that I was purchasing
on was of course the new glow kit from
Anastasia Beverly Hills in collaboration
with youtuber and Nicole Guerrero I do
have a video on this as well
unfortunately it's not the best video in
the world because mine came shattered so
that was a bummer but my video explains
like what happened and what Sephora did
for me and just kind of the whole story
so I'll have that linked down below as
well but I was super bummed when I got
this because I ordered it early I really
wanted to create a review video and
instead I had to make a video talking
about why I got a shattered palette like
it just kind of sucked and I'm super
bummed no 143 is gone but I didn't want
to just
like throw it away I didn't know what to
do so I got this super fancy Tupperware
container and put one for three inside
so that's what I'm doing people and
people are making suggestions like do
something like artist couture or like
the Mac pigment you know put them in
something like that I don't have
anything like that hanging around but
it's like hey Tupperware can do the job
too right so that's primer one core
three is super fancy it's so challenging
to like take Instagram photos with this
because it just like looks wrong and
like when I have it in videos and I show
up people are like what did you do to
the Wonder for three I'm like I do not
do that that is how it came to me other
than that though other than it being
shattered I think this is a really
stunning highlight palette I have it on
today I have the shade glow getter on my
cheekbones and like so far all of the
shades I think are just beautiful I've
also used them as eyeshadows and I think
that they're really stunning my
favorites I think definitely are a kitty
cat and forever lit I love these two got
the palette I wish it wasn't broken but
that's okay that was the main reason for
my support order but I also really
wanted to pick this up I talked about it
in a will i buy it video and said i
wanted to buy it it is from way haircare
and it's the dry shampoo foam so this I
have only used it one time so far but I
really liked it and it smells really
good like it smells so good and I could
tell all day long like whenever I was
like do anything or shake my head or
touch my hair I could smell it again
and I thought it smelled really good so
for the one time that I've used it so
far I think it worked really well um I
don't have great feedback on it yet
because I need to keep using it a little
bit more but I was excited to pick this
up this was like twenty eight dollars I
think or something like that but I was
excited this is my first item that I
purchased from way haircare one more
thing I forgot to mention that I got
from Ulta hello I'm so excited about
this this is from ELF cosmetics and it's
one of their like aqua infused bronzer
blush duos so this is what it looks like
I've been hearing so many people save
really good things about this like aqua
infused blush bronzer duo happening
especially June Beauty 89 or Jessica
Braun I love her videos and she's been
talking about this a lot so I was like
okay I'm gonna pick one up I have mine
in the shade bronzed pink beige I like
it comes with the mirror I have both the
bronzer and the blush on today they are
really really nice they feel like
they're wet but they're not those are
some swatches there of the blush and
bronzer and like they ever super
pigmented and really nice very smooth
they're like a cream to powder I really
like this this was definitely a good
purchase I was really happy with this
another package that got sent to me that
I was so excited about this is something
that I just mentioned in my makeup
monthly where I talked about my
favorites and my fails and the fine
products that I was trying out in
February shouldn't this as a favorite
and then I got a package justice white
box but it's from Dermalogica and inside
they sent me two more of the Super Foley
and I was like thank you because I love
this product so much I have been
recommending it a lot and it's been
really exciting because I've been
getting snapshots and like tagged on
Instagram and you guys were telling me
that you bought it and you bought it cuz
my recommendation if you guys ever buy
anything based off my recommendations
please let me know because that's like
the coolest thing ever to know that
people like really are listening to me
like that's just so cool that makes me
so happy but yes the daily super Foley
and this is such a good product
Dermalogica is a newer brand to me that
I've been trying to skincare wise and
I've been so happy with so many other
products is something I use almost on a
daily basis and I think it is fantastic
so I was so thrilled when they sent me
this as a couple backups like so happy
about it thank you so much Dermalogica I
also I made a purchase from Sigma Beauty
and then they also sent me a package as
well and I'll show you guys what I
picked up first so where should I even
begin so I picked this up I haven't used
it yet because I've been waiting to put
it in my haul video just to show you
guys how nice and clean it is before I
really get in here but this is the Sigma
dry in shape spa three-in-one brush care
you can deeply clean your brush and then
efficiently dry up to 18 brushes at once
and then
so you can store your brushes in here
like woah so I just think this is really
cool I have the Sigma like glove and I
talked about it all the time and how
much I love it and I just thought this
concept is really cool as well because I
like that you can also dry your brushes
because I don't have anything like that
I just kind of like set a towel up and
then stuff the brushes upside down on
the top like it's it's not like the most
the most best thing out there but I
thought this was really cool and I'm
gonna want to try it for a long time I
think it had been on stock for awhile
but the night I was looking and said it
was back in stock and I was like I'm
getting it I think this was like in the
twenty dollar range I'll leave it linked
down below oh and also Sigma just gave
me a coupon code I'm so excited about
this they reached out to me and gave me
my own discount code for you guys so if
you ever purchased from Sigma you can
use the code Samantha and I'll get you
10% off it is an affiliate code and I
would make a small Commission off that
but I would be forever grateful and you
guys know I love Sigma I talk about
Sigma all the time I did a full video
with my Sigma Beauty Collection I'm
constantly using them and recommending
them and I'm so excited to try this so
again it's kind of like the glove it has
the different like ridges grooves all
that good stuff to clean your brushes
and then you can pop the brushes in here
and then even set them in here and
as you dry them I just thought that was
so cool so I'm really excited to try
this I'm gonna try to do like maybe like
an Instagram video showing me cleaning
my brushes with this I'm really excited
so now I can do that since I finally
featured it in this haul
I also picked up another Sigma jek the
brush shampoo because I freaking love
this stuff you guys and I've been
getting really low on mine and it's
legitimately made me like not clean my
brushes as much because I'm like no I
don't want to run out so I finally just
purchased a backup so I can get over
that and clean my brushes I think
tomorrow is gonna be my make up brush
cleaning magic brush shampoo so good I
highly recommend this it's 100% natural
it's good for you it's good for your
brushes it makes cleaning them super
easy this is a good one I also purchased
the cashmere classic brush set I was
really excited for this this is actually
my extra one cuz you will see this in
the upcoming
give away coming Stephen you haven't
subscribed yet you should because you
could win this but I was excited to get
this because I love Sigma brushes
they're like some of my favorite brushes
and if you can buy them and set they're
a little bit cheaper which i think is
cool so this one comes with the e25 the
e-40 and the e 45 only brush that i did
have was the e 25 and in my sigma beauty
collection video I said I wanted like 40
of these so I now have 2 which is
excellent such a good these are all like
blending brushes and eye brushes and
then I always hear people talk about the
e-40 like I always hear about this brush
and people are constantly using it super
excited to get it it's a really big
fluffy brush and I've been loving this
I've been using this so much and then
the other one that I got is the e 45 and
I really like this one because it has
more of like the pointed tip to it and I
really love this for like crease work so
good I've been really happy really happy
with that one and these ones they're all
kind of like that gold instead of just
like the regular like silver because it
comes and like the cashmere classics
that I think they released these around
the holiday time but I know that you can
get a better deal if you purchase the
three and all three of these I would
definitely recommend so I was excited
about that and then the last thing I got
was another brush I love big brushes so
this is the F 25 and it's a very large
brush kind of like tulip-shaped type of
brush I feel like I see Amanda and Singh
use this a lot too like dust away the
powder on her face and I'm like yeah I'm
just I'm just gonna need to to finally
get this this has been on my Sigma wish
list for so long and because I was
getting the other things I was like you
know what just just do it and I did and
I love this brush I love the way it
looks I love that it's big
I like the big makeup brushes and I
cannot lie but it is really nice to dust
away the powder and even like down here
if I put a powder to clean up contour
you can dust it away it's super easy
is this the brush that everybody needs
no but I just wanted it so whatever but
yes so that is the last one that I got
from Sigma and then what Sigma sent me I
was really excited about because I sent
more brushes they also sent me their new
loose shimmer and glitter like powders
and they sent me five so this is what
the packaging looks like I haven't even
opened them yet
so now that I've destroyed the box this
was ethereal and whoo so this is what
the packaging looks like looks wild oh
my goodness can you see that that is
ethereal whoa this looks way pretty I
have way too much on my left at this
moment okay that is ethereal I just like
so lightly dipped my finger in that oh
my gosh that is so cool it's like
purpley iridescent whoa I am excited to
use these and try these out so they sent
me five of the glitters and I cannot
wait to test these out again these are
newer to Sigma but I will leave them a
link down below so in addition to the
glitters they sent along three brushes
and they're all like highlighting type
of brushes this one is the f56 the
accentuate highlight now I almost bought
this brush in my order because I wanted
it as like cleaning up a contour type of
brush like I've been really interested
in getting one of these brushes for that
task so I think it's interesting that it
says it's a highlight brush which I
guess you could easily stamp on
highlight but I don't know I don't know
if I would use this for highlight but
I'm excited because I would totally use
it with my baking powder so that's super
cool but then these two brushes I really
really like this one is the F 37 it's
the spot light duster it reminds me a
little bit of the F 25 not as much of a
tulip shape but it's kind of what it
reminds me of just a little bit smaller
so I mean you could definitely dust
highlight on you could use this to sweep
away powder I think there's a lot of
different uses for this one which has me
excited but this brush has me so sold
this is the fo3 the high cheekbone
highlighter this is an amazing highlight
brush since I got this set which was
just a couple days ago at me
leave but I've been wearing highlight
almost every single day and this is the
only thing as I've been using to apply
it my highlight I love this brush but it
just applies the highlight so
beautifully I used it today to apply my
highlight I'm super happy with this
brush if you're looking for a new
highlight brush I would highly suggest
the fo3 from sigma super grateful to
sigma for sunday may not only the loose
highlights like I thought they were just
sending me the glitters but then to also
add in the three brushes I was like
thank you so much so appreciative so big
thank you to Sigma it's two more items
and we are done I know it's starting to
get dark oh so fat I did get my lip
monthly bag in the mail and I was super
excited about it I have been getting lip
monthly I think for like three months or
so they do send them to me but I'm such
a like lipstick addict love addict that
I feel like these are really good for me
personally because I like the lipsticks
they do send a little card now as well
with them and it has each of the
products inside and what they are worth
you can see how much your bag is this
was my February bag and I thought it was
really cute but inside I did do this on
snapchat but I thought this is really
cool because they also included an
eyeshadow I think this is the second
monthly bag that I've gotten that had
not just lip products on it and also a
flip monthly that's really cool is that
you get all full-size products which i
think is awesome but this had me excited
because this is from cargo cosmetics
it's an eye shadow in Mojave and a lot
of people brought me back and said that
cargo has really good eye shadows so I
was really excited to see that and then
also inside was this is from sugar it's
there mad as hell crayon lipstick in
poison ivy very cool from a Cosmo holic
it's a gloss and it is in didn't have a
shade name I don't think how to shave
name but this is what it looks like if
you can see it on camera it looks really
cool like it looks like a cool lip
topper so that was awesome
and then the last one that came in here
this is from model Co it's the power
stay lipstick in the shade it E so it
just looks like a nice and
Jade so I thought that was awesome again
I've been getting these every month and
been really happy with them I like them
more than some of the other
subscriptions that I was getting and I
really like that you have full-sized
products and also know with lip monthly
they have the option where you can make
an account and you can go in and
actually like choose what shades that
you like so you can kind of even
customize it even a little bit more like
so for me I like getting the nudes and
not like a bright red or a bright orange
or something that I'm not gonna wear as
much so that's really neat if you create
your account with flip monthly go in and
make sure that you do the shade
selection they also gave me a discount
code it is just March beauty and it gets
you a fifty five percent off your bag
would use wild it is an affiliate coach
just so you guys know but the lit
monthly bags I think they're good ones
if you are lipstick addicts like me
otherwise they might not be totally
worth it for you but if you love
lipsticks and trying out new lipsticks
and finding different brands then I
think that you would like it the last
item that I got was a PR package if you
guys follow me on snapchat which you
should I'm just cemented at March I
cried like a baby when I got this I
think I cry at every PR package that I
get sent because it's just like such an
overwhelming feeling of being recognized
and you know brands want to send you
their items and they you know want you
to talk about it with your subscribers
like it's just such a really cool
feeling but when I got this tote bag
from Kevin O Quon I lost it like I lost
it I was like oh my gosh I can't believe
this happening I talked about Kevin
Daquan in the 7 brands that I want to
try video I talked about Kevin naquan in
a will i buy it video and said how much
I want to try this brand and I felt like
2017 was the year that I was going to
try out Kevin tequan and then they
freaking send me a package I'm like I
mean I'm sure they didn't see any of
those videos like I'm not playing myself
over here but I still was like blown
away so it's such a cool tote bag and
then inside they send along a couple of
goodies and I'm so excited to try these
out I haven't yet
honestly kind of afraid to I'm like
still really overwhelmed but they sent
along the sensual skin enhancer this is
what it looks like Kevyn Aucoin it can
be found at Sephora so I will have these
linked down below so there is what that
looks like oh my goodness like it just
looks so fancy I'm just Oh like I don't
do fancy very well you guys I'm not very
fancy personally don't ever take me out
for a nice dinner cuz I stare at the
money like I also sent along this Finch
of wool skin primer so there is what
that packaging looks like and then let's
open it up to the other because I
haven't I haven't done that yet either
see oh oh is this the one this is the
one where you like pressed down and the
product comes out I see people who use
this on snapchat oh I didn't really
that's what applies also in there were
two brushes
this was the concealer brush I think I'm
saying it right and then this one was
the angled foundation brush and I was
like and then I man I made the mistake
of going on Sephora and seeing how much
this cost full price it's a lot of money
I was like oh my gosh I'm never gonna be
able to use this thing cuz I'm so afraid
of like roading it it's so beautiful and
I'm excited to use it I'm just this
package just gave me so many
somebody feels and I just want to say
thank you to you guys because without
you guys I'm without your support out
you watching my videos like Breen's
wouldn't take notice of me and they
wouldn't want to send me product so I
just I'm very grateful to you guys so to
get something from Kevin of Quan just
really meant a lot to me I'm just really
excited to try out the products and
really grateful to be given that
opportunity so thank you guys for the
