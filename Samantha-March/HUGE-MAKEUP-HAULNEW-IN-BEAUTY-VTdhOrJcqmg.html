today's video is going to be a very
large mega Paul I have a box in front of
me that is just like stuffed with so
this is mostly from Sephora a little bit
from Ulta and then i also have a couple
products from actively that i want to
share with you guys and i can go more
into detail about what actually is and
how to sign up for it when i touch on
those products and I'm really excited we
have a lot of stuff to go over here a
lot of stuff is more like new in make up
a little bit more like new makeup
products not all of it but a lot of it
is new makeup so I wanted to show
everything to you guys and I also
apologize if I'm talking weird or like
my mouth that's funny I literally just
got home for the dentist just sat down
to start filming so my mouth is still
feeling a little bit odd so if I sound
funny or look funny because I was just
at the dentist and I have no cavities
thank you so much so why don't we go
ahead and hop into this makeup haul on
the two products that I received from
octa Lee I have talked about actally in
one of my past haul videos but I will
touch on it again actally is basically
for beauty influencers beauty bloggers
and it is a way to get free products
from brands so basically if you are
beauty bloggers or influence hair you
would sign up on actally you do need to
have a certain amount of either like
subscribers or followers under youtube
or Instagram in order to qualify to sign
up for actively but i will leave a link
below it is a referral link so i get
like referral points if you use my link
but you can see if you do qualify and
what happens is that brands can put
their products up in the free store is
what it's called on actally and then the
influencers can come in and request
products and let the brand's know like
why you think you'd be a good fit to try
out this product and then if they say
yes they ship you the product and then
you have 15 days to feature it in one of
your videos put the products in you know
whatever type of video like today's are
going to be in a haul video but they
could be in a tutorial type of video
whatever it is that you're going to be
filming next it just has to be featured
in the video in some sort of way so I
will touch on the couple products that i
received here i think
a really cool service it's not paid so
like this video isn't sponsored by these
brands or by actively it's not a paid
thing you really are just getting these
products in order to review and then
share on your social media so I think
it's really neat it's been working
really well for me so far but again I
will leave that link down below I
definitely would suggest you check out
if actively like it's good for you yet
like if you're able to sign up for it
because I think it's a really cool
surface so one of the items that I cow
is from pure cosmetics and it is their
cameo contour so very very reflective
packaging here but it's a dual ended
contour foundation that's interesting it
says it includes a contour blending
sponge so it was a little bit strange to
me that it said dual-ended contour
foundation because then I was like I
thought this was like a highlight and
contour stick so the word foundation
kind of threw me off but if you can see
on the back of the packaging like their
example like this definitely is
contouring highlighting not foundation
so a little bit confusing but that's
okay but this is what the actual product
it looks like so you can see it has the
dual ends so on this side I haven't
opened this up yet so on this side we
have the contour which looks a little
bit dark that's it's kind of dark for me
but you know we can make it work so that
is the contouring side and then the
highlight side and that is what the
highlight side looks like and that looks
like it might actually be pretty good so
there's the contour and highlight
together I do plan on using this in an
upcoming tutorial I want to do a lot of
what I'm going to talk about in this
hall I'm going to do like a full face
try on video tutorial does that make any
sense I'm going to take a lot of these
new products that I'm talking about and
actually apply them all to my face and
let you know how it goes and this is
definitely going to be one of them so
I'm super curious to see how this works
I'm going to use the contour side I
might not use the highlighter because i
have another concealer that i want to
talk to you guys about in here but i
will definitely be using the contour
side it's in the shade medium which i
did request because the light looked a
little bit too late for me but i don't
know might have to play around with that
contour
little bit and just kind of go in a
little bit light handed but we will see
I just thought that was really
interesting and it does come with its
own little sponges well it's a little
pink sponge it's kind of interesting
because it has like a flat side over
here and then it's more like the Beauty
Blender here so i will be using that
when i try it out in my tutorial that's
coming up but super excited to get this
i love contouring a love highlighting i
love creating the Instagram makeup
tutorials if you don't follow me on
instagram a march booty word and i
showed a lot of makeup tutorials over
there and i'm always contouring and
highlighting let me tell you so
definitely curious to give this a shot
alex from the brand lancer i have not
heard of this brand yet but i've been
seeing more and more beauty influencers
talk about it on their snapchat so I've
been like this is interesting I actually
placed this order through oculi before I
even saw if going on anybody snaps and
then all this and I start seeing it so
the first thing that I got is a volume
enhancing lips RM so this is what it
looks like and to be honest I really
wanted the other thing that comes with
this asset but you could only order it
together so a lip serum I'm not so sure
what I feel about it i'm definitely
going to try it but I don't know if I
like need it to try it if that makes
sense this is what the packaging looks
like when you open it up I've yet to
open it up has apply to clean dry lips
within lip line do not apply outside of
line apply as needed throughout the day
so I'm assuming you just put it on and
it's supposed to make your lips bigger
so we shall see maybe I will use this
somehow end up coming tutorials well
like maybe I'll put it on at the
beginning of the makeup tutorial and see
what it looks like at the end i don't
know i'm excited i'm excited to give a
shot everyone always wants to make their
lips bigger so we'll see how that one
goes but the other one that i was really
excited for was the eye contour lifting
cream so this is what the packaging
looks like i am super into eye creams
you guys like super into eye creams so
know if it's because i'm slowly
approaching 30 or what it is but I'm
just like I'm gonna need some help here
this packaging looks really cool okay so
this is what it looks like again it's
like super super reflective so kind of
hard to
show the directions it says using the
ring finger gently pat the cream around
the eye area once or twice daily okay so
that's what it looks like it just has a
little pump I will definitely be putting
this on my vanity in my bathroom and
giving it a try probably like morning or
night and seeing if I notice any type of
results so i will start using this two
nights and let you guys know what i
think that i got from actally that i
wanted to touch on real quick up and
excited to try these out and let you
know again if you're interested in
seeing if you qualify for actively just
check the description box and i'll have
a link in there and let's just keep
rolling okay so I was really excited to
get this and I've been using it a lot so
that I would show you guys so Benefit
Cosmetics came out with brackets is
probably now that Benefit Cosmetics is
like known for their brow line so they
came up with these little kit ideas they
have three different ones i picked up
the one that says soft and natural
because it had the three products inside
that I was most interested in getting
they have two other ones as well but
inside this is what the inside of the
soft and natural looks like so you get a
set of stencils which honestly I don't
use I kind of like played with them one
day but I truly didn't understand it and
you also get three brow products in here
so the first one that you get is the
goof proof pencil now I have a deluxe
size like sample size of the goof proof
pencil and I absolutely loved it I'm in
the shade two of you are curious so it
has the bully on one end and then it has
your product on the other and I have
already been like using this pencil so
much but I am very very new to browse
like super new to browse I really didn't
do much today because I'm kind of in a
rush to be filming so I just rinsed some
tinted brow gel through it through my
brows but this goof proof pencil like if
you are new to browse I think this could
help you a lot or if you have kind of
fuller eyebrows anyways like maybe you
just need to cover up some sparse areas
type of thing this one could be a really
really good option I've just been loving
it I think it's really easy to work with
and then also included in the kit is
their high brow pencil so the high brow
is one that I wanted to try for real
long time because I hear a lot of really
good things about it and basically all
it is is I can do a little swatch for
you here so that's what it looks like
and you just place it underneath your
brows it can be used to clean up the
brows it can be used to highlight the
brow bone and it's really a stuff that I
didn't do a lot but now that i have been
doing it I'm like yeah that's a really
obvious step so I've been really happy
to get this and then the last product in
there is the ready set of brow so this
is what it looks like and it's just a
clear brow gel to keep the brows in
place and to kind of set everything so
the highbrow and the goof proof pencil
these are both full-size products that
you get in the kit and the Ready Set bro
is a mini but what I think is really
cool is the value of this kit it is
thirty four dollars for the whole thing
and the goof proof pencil and the high
brow pencil I believe are like 22 and 21
dollars or like 22 and 20 for dollars on
their own so you definitely are saving
money in the kits again this is just the
soft and natural brows there is also two
other ones and I can link all of them
down below but depending on what it is
you need with benefit they have like
each one has like different tasks inside
of the kid I just think it's such a good
idea you're gonna save money because you
get full-size products inside I think
it's an awesome idea I have been
obsessed with using this lately I can't
stop using it so happy that I bought it
think it's a great deal and I think it's
going to really help me out with my brow
game cuz I'm trying purchase that you
guys have probably seen is the Sephora
give me some lip collection so I do have
a full video about this collection I go
through and swatch each of the six
Lippi's that come inside and I'm also
giving away the collection as well so if
you haven't seen that video yet i will
leave it linked down below but you can
enter to win this and i also do go
through each of the six Alypius that you
get and ice watch everything and give
like a little first impression on it
this also is a really amazing value
because it's only twenty eight dollars
and you get these to the Lancome juicy
shaker and the Smashbox liquid lipstick
these are full sizes inside the rest are
middies but these two are full-size
regularly I think they're like 22 and 24
and again you get this whole thing for
28 it's a fantastic deal this before
favorites collections are a really
amazing deal but again i'll leave that
full video link down below if you want
to watch it because I give a lot more
detail in that video scene that I picked
up the sale by her uche with a Tarte
cosmetics palette so i've been loving on
this palette again i have a full video
down below going through the palette and
watching everything I do have a makeup
tutorial coming up using this palette as
well I've been doing a ton of tutorials
overrun in securing with it it's thirty
dollars I think it's an amazing palette
easy to travel with it's very small and
compact comes those six eyeshadows and a
blush and a big mirror it's amazing on
the town for labor day weekend this is
what I took with me so happy I got this
ballad felt that I picked up that I'm so
excited about is the tartlet in bloom
from Tarte cosmetics so everybody I
swear talks about this palette and says
how amazing it is and I just never got
it and finally finally I succumbed and I
decided to get it and it is beautiful so
I have not used it yet and I have no
idea how but this is the eyeshadow
palette that I'm going to use in my
full-face makeup tutorial that's coming
up so I haven't touched it yet I haven't
even watched it and it's absolutely
beautiful i'm so happy i got it i know
this isn't a new makeup product but
still so many people rave about it so
I've just been saving my money to get it
and so happy I barely got it so weird
they did a fluoride treatment on it
which I didn't really I don't even I
don't even know whether this but it
makes your teeth feel like fuzzy like
there's a fuzzy film on them oh my gosh
it's so weird so weird dump is from
cinema secrets and this is their makeup
brush cleaner so this is a repurchase I
absolutely love this stuff I have a
little guy like a little spray bottle
and then I just pour some of this into
the spray bottle because it's just
easier for me I can travel with it it's
very quick but then when that bottle
runs out and I just refill it with this
and then when this bottle runs out i buy
a new one I love this stuff this is to
do like very quick spot cleans for your
makeup brushes it doesn't deep clean
them but it gets of the shadows and the
pigments off the brushes so say you only
have one blending brush but you want
three different colors you can spot
clean in between each color and it is
quick-drying which I mean it's literally
quick drying there's no wetness to your
brush ever so you don't have to wait for
them to dry it's absolutely amazing I
highly recommend this stuff I use it
practically every day really excited to
try out those products because this is
new this is the Anasazi of Beverly Hills
stick foundation everyone has been
talking about this I saw it come out it
came out first just on the Anasazi a
website and I didn't buy into it because
I wanted to wait and see if it was
coming to sephora or alto before i
bought it because i really enjoyed
getting points and when it came out at
sephora by that time so many people had
already reviewed it and said it was just
freaking amazing so here we go I bought
it it's going to be great I don't know
about my shade because I got mine and
natural there was so own oh this is
gonna be so light this is gonna work
this is totally not gonna work ok so
that's it I don't know maybe it will I
have no idea i thought i was going dark
too because i always pick to light a
foundations some whenever I picked out a
foundation I'm like no go a shade darker
sometimes I go two shades darker because
I always go so light but this was in
like the medium skin tone ok I don't
know I'll try it out I'm going to try it
out in that makeup tutorial coming up
here so we shall see how well the color
matches but I'm really excited to give
this a try I've just been hearing
phenomenal things about it it was only
twenty-five dollars which I didn't think
was terrible for a high-end foundation
I've also never tried to stick
foundation so I'm really curious to give
this a shot but keep watching I will
have a full face tutorial coming very
soon featuring this foundation all right
nearing the end I promise okay so also
from Tarte I got their shape tape
concealer because it once again
everyone's been talking about this
concealer and saying how amazing it is
so I think this is the concealer that
I'm going to use in my upcoming tutorial
and this is like a big ol concealer and
I've heard the wand just really large
too so let's see holy SH night kids ok
so that's what the wand looks like um
let's see oh dear that's ok so I went to
like try to do a casual swatch and it
came out like that that's going to be
interesting to try to put on okay um all
right the shade looks okay I got light
medium I wasn't sure but I figured Mike
medium was a safe bet so again there is
wiggle Kahuna swaps right there I'm
really excited to try it out everyone
says this is amazing so we shall see
stay tuned Kazama drive dirt repurchase
and it's from Maybelline it's their
liquid eyeliner there's some like some
weird sticker on it ok so it is their
liquid eyeliner so i have this liner I
talk about all the time I use it all the
time I use it in so many tutorials it's
amazing I started to run out as I was
doing my latest fall makeup tutorial
like in that video I was like oh great
my liner is running out so I ran out
right away and got a new one so that
tells you how much I love it it's
Maybelline it's affordable I think it's
fantastic so another brow product that i
got from benefit is there gimme brow and
it says this is a brow volumizing fiber
gel this is what it looks like and when
i got it in the mail I thought it was
like a deluxe sample because it seems so
small but I looked it up and it says
that it's right and oh I just realizing
that I got the shade one and in my other
brow stuff I'm in a shade too so I don't
know if this is going to be a good fit
so this is what it looks like no
seriously doesn't this just look like a
tiny little guy and this is twenty-four
dollars seriously that's so weird okay
whatever I mean I looked at what this is
crazy look at that I had no idea that's
like what it was oh man okay so this is
what I'm going to use my brows with in
the tutorial since I've already hardcore
hit up the soft and natural so huh okay
wanna give it a shot and see what we
think I didn't expect it to look like
that I don't know why but we'll give it
a try everyone says this is really good
too especially if you just want to fill
in sparse areas because it has like the
brow fibers in there it's supposed to
make you like look like you have hairs
so this might be good for like days in a
pinch we shall see samples that i
thought i'd show you because why not one
is from Clinique it's an acne solutions
clinical
clearing gel this is what it looks like
this was like a little sephora weekly
special sample so it's like oh my gosh
this is like the tiniest cutest little
thing I've ever seen in my life so it
has salicylic acid in it so this might
be good just to like top / breakouts
alright I give it a try I like clinique
that one is from this coup de lis Codel
a codel I and it's an eye cream because
I told you guys I love I creams I'm very
afraid for 30 to get here very afraid so
I'll try this out i like to packaging i
like the gold I thought it was cute says
apply morning and evening might have to
wait on this for a little bit since I
just got the other eye contour cream and
I want to see which one works so i don't
know maybe you'll even see this in a
giveaway who knows the last thing i got
i'm pretty excited about it's the glam
glow super mud clearing treatment so
this is what it looks like i really do
like glam glow I just think it's so
stinking expensive this was a 100-point
forget sephora so I figured why not try
it like I by the little guys of it that
are like nineteen dollars maybe not like
the big juggs that are like eighty
dollars or something but i thought i
would give this little sample a try you
know I hear really good things about it
so I don't know we'll see I'll
definitely give it a try I think it's
supposed to be like more like the
charcoal type treatment maybe type of
thing possibly I don't know we'll give
it a try I like glam glow I figured I'd
try it out I had some points build up so
I figured a hundred points why not give
it a shot through that as fast as I
could because I know that was a pretty
big haul but that is my most recent
sephora and alcohol cool prize from
octiline here i'm probably going to go
on a know by now usually after a couple
of larger halls i tried to put myself on
a nova and that's probably what i will
be doing after this but like i said i do
have that full face using a lot of these
products for the first time i'll be
doing that tutorial coming up here
really soon and i'm excited to try it
out because some of these products i've
had for a few weeks now and i have been
able to try and because i've been saving
it for that video because i think it has
been actually really requested I didn't
realize the full face trying on makeup
tutorials were so popular but a lot of
people have requested it so I figured
why not do it so now
I feel like I got pretty much everything
to do mostly a full face so I should be
able to get it done for you guys so be
on the lookout for that I'm really
excited if there's anything that you
want me to put in an upcoming review
video just let me know I can either do a
review i can do a fabric fail something
like that but if there's any products in
particular that you're really curious
about just leave in the comments below
and i will make note of that so i can
feature them in an upcoming review video
if you did enjoy this hull i hope you
will give it a thumbs up and i hope you
will subscribe before you go we are
almost 10k and i'm so excited about it
thank you so much i'm so pumped so if
you haven't yet i hope you will

of exciting videos coming up here real
