so excited for today's video because it
is finally going to be all about the
crazy amazing insane PR package that I
received from NYX Cosmetics they
recently sent me over 120 lipsticks from
four of their different lines
it was super overwhelming I have a PR
haul here on my youtube channel titled
most overwhelming PR cull then I will
have link down below in case you want to
check it out but when I got that package
and saw all those lipsticks my very
first thought was what in the world am I
going to do with all of these lipsticks
so what can I do what kind of giveaway
can I have and I'm finally here filming
this video and I'm so excited about it
what I decided to do was go through all
the lipsticks and take out some that I
want to keep for myself so this is my
bag that I'm going to keeper myself
there's two different lines in here from
NYX Cosmetics that I had never tried
before so I was taking some time trying
them out so I can give a mini review on
each of the four different lines I'm
going to share some swatches I chose a
variety of different colors including
this crazy purple that I have on my lips
right here I tried to choose a variety
of different colors from each line so I
can show you some swatches but then I'm
also going to be having a huge giveaway
with 4 different winners so I have bags
here filled with 20 different lipsticks
each and I'm going to be having a huge
giveaway with 4 different winners I am
super excited about it if you want
so you entered in the giveaway and see
how you can win one of your own bags of
lipstick from NYX Cosmetics and that
will be at the end but first I'm going
to go through each line share my
thoughts on them a little bit as
information about them share some
swatches from the lipsticks that I
decided to keep for myself and then we
will finish off with this giveaway so
I'll say for this video I've been
working on it for quite some time now
and I'm just excited that it's finally
time to film this video so that further
adue want to go ahead and get started
first up I'm going to talk about the
soft matte lip cream so these have been
one of my favorite lipsticks for years
and years before I had a youtube channel
I was buying the soft matte lip creams
these are only $5.99 at Ulta drugstore
prices can vary from Ulta to Target to
Walgreens things like that so the prices
can vary a little bit but at all -
they're $5.99 that's typically pretty
standard for what I see would be soft
matte lip creams and you do get points
to seven fluid ounces of product again
these are just some of my favorite
lipsticks across the board
I recently did a top ten nude liquid
lipsticks and I actually mentioned these
two I believe in they're from NYX from
the soft matte lip cream line because it
is one of my favorite formulas it is
similar to a liquid lipstick but it's
not drying it all on the lids it is very
soft on the lips exactly what the name
says it's like but if they do dry down
and magic they are not completely
transferred proof and they will fade
throughout the day but they are fairly
long lasting and they are very easy to
reapply unlike some liquid lipsticks
that can start to gunk up the lips
they're just really really nice
lipsticks and at $5.99 I feel like you
cannot go wrong they have some amazing
shades in there I did have three in my
collection already so I pulled those out
of my collection so I could swatch them
instead of opening a new one and I just
I really love this formula I recommend
it quite a bit so I have some swatches
here on my arms I'll go ahead through
each of the swatches the first one that
I have is in Acton and then this first
one right here is Athens it's a really
nice pale pink nude next one I have
swatch is boy mount Airy's this one
right here is way notes areas this one
has more of a coral tinge to it if we
have a London this is one from my
collection and this is one that I have
repurchased is several times over so
this one right here is London it's more
of a nude Brown next to that also is Abu
Dhabi this is also from my collection
and also one of my favorites that I have
repurchased London and Abu Dhabi are
very similar to one another this is what
packaging of Abu Dhabi looks like but I
like to have both of them in my
collection and I have repurchased them
in the past tip I have can and this one
is cans right here it is a really nice
pink kind of like an everyday pink I
would say and then next to cans is is
tan Bowl and it's more of a brighter
vivid pink and that one is in a sample
this next one is another one from my
collection this is San Paulo so this one
right here is San Paulo and then after
San Paulo we have Berlin which is more
kind of like a chocolate brown
then to finish up the soft matte lip
creams that we have Amsterdam and then
this one is answer damn is kind of like
a pinkish red for that one we have
Morocco and Morocco is more of a neon
orange so the second to last one here is
Morocco and then the last one we have is
Havana which is a purple this one is the
Havana packaging it's more of a purple
but it definitely has some blue
undertones in it so those were all of
the soft matte lip creams that I decided
to hang on to for myself so in next up
I'm going to talk about their matte
lipsticks so these run for $5.99 at also
also and these are I believe 0.16 ounces
of product so these are more of like
your regular lipstick not a liquid
lipstick or like the soft matte lip
cream more of the regular lipstick but
they do have the matte finish see the
packaging here the packaging on this one
is a little bit you know like the
plastic key almost kind of like cheaper
type of feeling but again only $5.99 for
a lipstick which of course is not a bad
price so I'll go through some swatches
here I apologize for my swatches I don't
I really don't like swatching and I
really have no swatch game so we're just
going to have to put up with that
because I don't really know the best way
yet to swatch on video it is not my
forte but I will say before we get into
the swatches what I thought about these
matte lipsticks is that they definitely
work my fav I thought there was a lot of
like hidden missing here the first time
that I tried one of these it was really
hard to put on my lips it did not glide
on smoothly it almost like skipped over
my lips it was chunky one of the
lipsticks actually broke off because
like I was trying to press so hard to
get it to run across my lips that I
actually broke off the tip of the
lipstick but then others glided on it so
nicely like it just was so hit and miss
throughout this line that it was kind of
confusing to kind of say that these are
my favorite NYX lipsticks are a nice
matte lipstick and again especially for
the price you know it's hard to go wrong
but I think there's a lot of hit and
miss throughout here so that's the only
like kind of downfall that I found with
them so not my favorite matte lipstick
but still pretty good why don't we go
ahead and I'll show you guys some
swatches of the ones that I decided
hang on - so the first one that we have
here is shy and shy is a really really
pale almost like beige nude this one I
don't think actually would look great on
my skin tone because I think it's just
going to be too beige and kind of maybe
almost look like a concealer on me next
one that we have is bare with me and
then again of course like the name says
this one is more of a nude as well but
but this one is more of like my style of
nude so that one is bare with me the
next one I have is daydream and this one
is daydream right here
I have actually worn this one it has
more of like a peachy coral vibe to it
and this was one that was super super
drying on my list so daydream was not my
favorite the next one that I have is
strawberry daiquiri and the swatch of
strawberry daiquiri is right here so
again more of a nude but you know kind
of just like what the name says more of
like strawberry nude let's go with that
the next one I have is with caviar and
this one is the swatch of whipped caviar
this one is more of a mauve this one is
tea rose this was one of my favorites
from this line more of a deeper mauve as
the previous one but this one did I
thought it looked really nice and went
on really smoothly on the lips this next
one is summer breeze and then summer
breeze is more of a cool toned pink this
one is sweet pink and this one has more
fuchsia vibes to it this was another one
that was really hard to glide onto my
lips this next one is siren this is more
of the fancy shade so this one is a
siren right here
this one could be described more as like
the black cherry and the final one that
I have is Bloody Mary
or as a Bloody Mary is more of your red
but again it has a lot of pink tones in
it so that final one is Bloody Mary so
next time I'm going to talk about the
NYX
Alondra ray liquid lipsticks these I
also have tried myself I own two alum
and I really really enjoy these guys I
have
amended them a lot I wear them very
frequently I just really like the
lingerie lipstick so I was excited to
try more out these are $6.99 at Ulta and
you get two point one three fluid ounces
of product these are the closest to a
liquid lipstick that makes offers I
would say these are the most
long-lasting of the four lines that I am
talking about completely matte finish
and beige dried down I would say like
98% of the way every once in while I can
get a little bit of transfer especially
you know shortly after I put on the
lipsticks they take a little bit of time
to dry down but other than that they are
pretty darn it transfer proof and again
the closest thing to the liquid lipstick
from NYX Cosmetics and only $6.99 that
is not a bad price at all these are
called the elantra ray lipstick so the
entire line is a some sort of news from
the really really light shades to more
of the classic news and then we have
darker nudes as well again it's always
going to depend on your skin tone and
what nude is to you of course but I like
that there's a wide variety of news from
the lingerie collection if your nude
lover like me
you could definitely check it out one
thing that I have noticed I heard this
myself buzz of what the two lipsticks
that I own from this line I had not seen
it I really enjoyed mine but I heard
that these are pretty hit or miss as
well what I have noticed from this line
is the lighter the shades are they can
be very very streaky and just hard to
apply and just not literally look in the
bust and I definitely noticed that
within this line but first like three I
believe that I have to show you
none of them doesn't really look good on
my lips and you get into the more medium
to darker nudes in the collection I feel
like they look really really good on the
lips I don't find any sort of
streakiness problems with them and again
the two that I have owned previously
from NYX have been some of my favorites
I've recommended them several times and
I've worn them multiple times over so
that was one thing that I noticed from
the ellipta lingerie line but to jump
into some swatches first one I have here
is dusk-to-dawn and this first one here
is dusk-to-dawn next up we have silk
indulgence and this second one here is
self indulgent this one
more of a pink nude the next one I have
is satin ribbon and I actually really
didn't love that and ribbon on me it's
the third one right here this one if you
are my skin tone I don't think it would
work out it definitely just looked like
I had concealer lips this next one I
have is a ruffle trim and this is one
that I have owned myself previously so
this fourth one right here is ruffle
trim again just one of my personal
favorites and I really like the way this
one looks on me it's also a shade that I
own this one is bedtime flirts more of a
pink nude compared to ruffle trim again
these two are the ones that I've always
had and I really enjoyed both of them
and then this next one I have is a
bustier this one right here is bustier
this one is more of the mauve and I
actually really did enjoyed this one on
my lips as well this next one is
seduction and this one right here is
seduction I would say this one is pretty
close to ruffle trim to say a little bit
darker but I did like that one as well
and then the final two
this one is honeymoon and this second to
last one here is honeymoon this is one
that I thought was okay on me but it is
more of that gray Brown tone more on the
gray side so the second to last one is
honeymoon be a final shade I have is
teddy
and this one is definitely at the
darkest from all of them that I kept
that one is more of the brown nude the
next line and final line is that I have
to talk about that next scent along is
there a liquid suede lipstick I had not
tried this lined up before but I was
very excited to there was so many times
I came close to buying em because I saw
that they were so highly recommended and
then I just never did it are $6.99 and
also and you get 2.13 fluid ounces of
product this is what the packaging looks
like now these are kind of along the
same line as the Elan tear a liquid
lipstick I said they are not necessarily
as long-lasting they have more of a
velvety finish they are not completely
transfer proof and has this lipstick on
for maybe an hour or so and when I give
my hands a kiss that's what you get so
it's nothing like too crazy it's just
your eye pretty darn that but the lip
lingeries are definitely more of a you
know drier long-lasting formula but
these are really really close you never
comfortable than the lingerie lipsticks
they just glide on so easily stay stay
put they're super super pigmented I have
some fun colors from this line that I
decided to keep including of course the
purple that I'm wearing now and I have
just been so very impressed with this
line I've been loving everything that I
tried from them this one along with the
soft matte lip creams are the most
consistent across the board as compared
to the lingerie and the matte lipsticks
so if you haven't tried any of the
liquid suede I would highly highly
recommend them but I'll go ahead and
show you guys these swatches as well so
the first one that I have here is
sandstorm this first one right here at
sandstorm this is more of a nude Brown
it does remind me a bit of what the Kat
Von D bow and arrow and it definitely
became one of my favorite lipsticks the
next one I have here is soft-spoken a
lot of people had recommend it
soft-spoken
that is the second swatch right there
again just a really nice kind of a
deeper nude on me but a very very pretty
color next one that I have is pea and
cookies there is so many times I almost
bought this lipstick as well and I
always backed out but this one is more
of a pale pink this next one we have is
sway this is of course what I have on my
list right now here is the swatch of it
as well it's more of kind of like the
neon violet very very fun on the list of
course on in everyday color but I
thought you know we're filming a video
all about lipsticks like let's do
something crazy
I had wearing a purple lipstick on my
summer make a bucket list something to
give me out of my comfort zone and I
thought this would be a fun one so no
everyday one for me but something a
little fun and different to do the next
one I have is kitten heels and this is
the red from the collection and I like
this red from all of the other Reds that
I chose in the other vines because this
is more of a true red or the other ones
definitely were more pink red this one
is more of like your true red and I
really really like this one next up we
have Stone Fox I was so excited about
this shade a lot of people really do
love it this one is a right here and
it's more of kind of like your blue gray
it's definitely a very unique shade I
was between Stone Fox and sway to wear
for today I still need to wear Stone Fox
on my look so I'm very excited about it
another one that's outside of my comfort
zone but I think I'm going to like it
then the last one that I have here
little denim dress here is the final
sorts thereof little denim dress
definitely the electric-blue it's a
pretty wild color I'm going to give it a
try sometime I'm very excited for a lot
of these from the liquid suede are
pushing me out of my comfort zone but I
don't mind at all because hey it's just
makeup it's fun to wash this off it's no
big deal but that had me very excited
and I really ended up really loving the
liquid suede line so that is all of the
swatches in my many reviews on each of
the lipstick lines if I have to rate
these collections in order of my
favorites I think coming in fourth would
definitely be the matte lipsticks they
just weren't my favorite even though I
prefer matte finish formulas over like a
creamy lipstick I just didn't like the
inconsistencies throughout the formula
and I didn't like that some of them were
so hard and so kind of like chunky on
the lips so the matte lipstick would be
my fourth choice coming in my third
choice would actually be the lip
lingeries which kind of surprises me
because they were always some of my
favorite liquid lipsticks I really did
enjoy them but again seeing the
inconsistencies throughout the line and
how the lighter shades just do not look
good and are so streaky on the list I
actually would have to put them in my
number three spot out of the NYX
lipstick collections that were sent to
me in the number two spot I'm going to
put in the liquid suede which has me so
excited I'm really pumped that I found a
new lipstick formula that I absolutely
love
I really recommend these and at $6.99 I
don't think that you can go wrong at all
and then for my first choice of course
would have to be the soft matte lip
creams I just think they are so
versatile they are so easy for everybody
to use they're what I started using when
I was a beginner they are still what I'm
using now as I more like beginner
intermediate with the makeup they have a
huge array of colors and again at only
$5.99 I just you will never see me
without soft matte lip cream in my
collection and I typically always have
one in my purse as well just as it in
case they just have some really
beautiful colors in there and I love the
formulas so much those would be how I
would rate before different lipstick
lines that NYX Cosmetics sent to me
again super grateful for this package
but and also really grateful that I get
to put on a big ole giveaway for you
