today's video I'm going to be sharing a
new hall this is an all PR hall and I
have makeup and beauty and even some
fashion so I'm so excited to go over
everything with you I kind of have a lot
of stuff here but I want to share a new
hall with you guys because i've recently
gotten some really really cool packages
in the mail so i thought that i would
share them with you here so why don't we
just go ahead and hop into what I've
gotten apologize if I like look sick our
sound sick because I am sick I've been
feeling under the weather and I feel
like my voice is a little manly and I'm
like super pale and this was like the
most that I could do with my makeup and
I still haven't changed out of my sports
bar my comfy sure itself I apologize i'm
under the weather i'm struggling but
we're going to make it through it so
we'll try and make this as quick as i
can because i don't know how long my
voice is going to last for but i was
contacted by the company adore me
they're an online retailer and did they
let me know that they just recently
launched athletic wear within the
company as well adore me is kind of
known more for like bras panties
lingerie that sort of thing and they
just launched athletic wear which is
totally totally my style I love working
out I practiced yoga daily I'm always
sharing my workouts on snapchat I live
in comfy clothes because I work from
home so I was really excited they let me
pick out a couple pieces so i will show
you guys what I got so for adore me um
you buy them in sets you can't just buy
like leggings and a sports bra you do
have to buy them together as a set but
you can choose sizes so if you want a
size small and the leggings you can
choose a medium or a large for the
sports bra or the tank top or whatever
it is that you're purchasing so that is
nice but you do have to purchase them in
a set so the first set that I got
included these leggings they're black
leggings and then they have like a print
on the side and then why I really liked
them was because down here they have
like these cutouts I will try to insert
a picture I recently did some yoga and
they so I'll try to insert a picture so
you can see what they look like on but I
just thought they were super fun and
then the sports bra that came with it is
just like a
black sports bra with like the t-strap
back if you look really really close
there is like designs on the sports bra
but you have to look like really close
to be able to see them I got both of
mine in a size small the leggings fit
wonderfully there long enough for me
they fit very comfortably they go up
pretty high which I like with the
leggings I found I'm super comfortable
the sports bras I've only just tried
them on to see how they fit but what I
will say is that they're pretty small
like even when I pulled it out of the
package I was like oh that's kind of
small so you could probably go up a size
I'm always kind of in between a small
and medium because I have a larger chest
but I'm smaller around so the smalls
were just a little bit too small for me
so I would say if you're kind of like an
in-between size to go a size up for the
sports bras but the leggings I felt like
fit true to size these were comfortable
I haven't actually worked out in them
yet but they were comfortable to wear
and they felt like they were going to
actually hold me in like sometimes with
sports bras you're really going for look
versus like actually getting support
when you work out I felt there was a
good balance with this one I did feel
like there was a good balance there is
like cups inside not anything like
padding wise but there is cups in there
and I thought that helped out as well so
that was the first set I got and then
the next set I got probably has dog hair
on exceda literally was just wearing it
last night my dog was sitting in my lap
the whole time but they're more of like
a Navy pair and then all throughout the
legs they have sheer panels so you can
kind of see through them there are a
small in these and then the matching
sports bra looked like this so this is
what the matching sports bra looked like
and i will leave these sets linked down
below as well this sports bra I got in a
small and the same thing I kind of felt
like it was just a little bit too small
but it worked out and I felt like this
one offered even more support and then
the black one did for when it comes to
actually working out so overall i've
been super happy with my purchase from
adore me i'm obsessed with the leggings
i'm obsessed with them because they are
my style of leggings and I really liked
all the styles that
we had I like the leggings because
that's what I like to workout in I like
having fun things to work out in even
though I work out at home and nobody
else sees me I just kind of like am Smee
up more than working out and like baggy
sweatpants but also I go out in these
leggings these are like my going out
pants I've actually gone out in each of
these leggings and had a fantastic time
I don't really wear jeans I don't like
wearing jeans i'm not a big denim person
so i like to wear leggings but i love
when they're fun like this and kind of
like a little more like flirty type of
thing that's just more of my style
really really happy with my purchase
from adore me they do have a membership
system you don't have to be a member but
you do get like discounts and perks if
you do a membership so I think they have
a VIP membership and then a membership
and you can get your first set for 2495
if you do sign up for the membership I
can leave all the information that list
it down in the description box below but
looking at the membership as I was doing
it it does seem like a pretty good deal
especially because they have athletic
wear and then they also have like I went
and looked they have bodysuit obviously
like I said they have bras underwear at
lunch array that sort of thing and I
just I thought it was pretty cool I've
never actually been on the website
before so that was a lot of fun to see
but I can leave all the information and
a link down below I will also link to
both of the sets that I got but overall
I've been really really happy especially
with the leggings that I got so those
were my items from adore me just talking
for that amount of time has made me like
like am worn out now but I was really
excited because i was also contacted by
lip monthly they are a subscription
service where they send you a little
goodie bag full of lip products every
month and I was like I love lip products
like I'm into the subscription boxes or
like the beauty products but when it was
going to be focused all on lips like I
love lip products like that's what I'm a
junkie for so I immediately it was like
yes please yes so looking at the website
um you can do monthly for 1295 you can
do four months looks like it's fifty
dollars right now there is a
discount also have an annual plan it
looks to be around 155 again that's a
discount as well i'm not sure if it will
still be discounted prices when I put
this video live but that's what I'm
seeing on the website right now it also
says that they do ship internationally
and they always send a full-size
products I actually just got this i knew
i was going to do this hall and this was
the last like known PR package that i
was getting so i was waiting for it it
just showed up on my doorstep and i was
like get out of your funk pretend you're
not sick for a few minutes in film this
video just do it so I'm excited to open
it up but those are some of the prices
and they also gave me a coupon code it's
just March beauty I'll put it here and
then in the description box below and
you get fifty five percent off your
first bag so that's pretty exciting I
know that was cool so even if you do
it's a one month if you use the code and
get fifty five percent off it's like
what would that be what did I say it was
it be like six dollars or something to
get full size lip products like okay so
let's see when I open it up I like this
cute little bag I'm assuming maybe every
month they send a different bag I'm not
I don't know that for sure but that's
what this one looks like so the first
product I see is from cargo cosmetics
it's their essential lip gloss so looks
like this I'm not sure I probably won't
swatch everything mostly in the interest
of saving time for this video since it
might be a longer one and because I
might lose my voice in the middle of it
ICS from hikari is a lipstick in romance
I actually have tried caria before I've
tried um a bronzer from them so that
will be interesting and the next thing I
see is from be a bombshell and it is
their charmed lipstick again I have
tried via bombshell as well trying to
think of what I've tried from them I
think it might have been like a lip
gloss or a lipstick but let me just open
this one to see oh okay so this is what
the packaging looks like again like I
said these are all full-size products so
that looks to be like a nice brown shade
okay so that one was from be a bombshell
and then the last item in here is a lip
liner this is from Laurette see maybe
and deep orchid so that's what that
looks like and it actually looks like
it'll match a new lipstick that I
recently got so that's pretty cool but
that is everything that was in the lib
monthly bug again you will get a bag
full of full-size lip products every
single month if you're interested in the
bag you want to try it out and see what
your first one would be like you can use
my code March beauty for fifty-five
percent off and yeah everything will be
linked down below but thank you to lip
monthly I love trying out new lip
goodies like so to keep it rolling I
also got a package this week from Winky
looks I had recently seen crispy using
some Winky Lux products so when I was
contacted by them I was super excited to
try them out so they sent me actually a
pretty like generous package I got all
of these I got a face powder i got this
bow so kind of like walk you through
some of them so they sent me these three
lip balms they are like they're glossy
lip balms I thought the packaging was
really pretty so I did swatch all of
these on my snapchat as well so I
probably won't swatch them here again in
the interest of saving time and me not
feeling the best but this is what the
glossy lip balms look like and they run
for fifteen dollars so when i swatched
him they felt like they were pretty
sticky and i don't really like sticky
lip glosses so i'll have to try them out
on the lips and see what I think about
him but I haven't done it yet so I can't
give a review on those yet also did send
a three of their lip the lures now on
the website it says there Matt but I
didn't think they'd ride down Matt I
tried a couple on my lips but I really
really liked this one it is in the shade
meow it looks like that so it's just
like the really nice mauve color and I
thought they were very like creamy going
on they felt good going on like they
almost kind of felt like hydrating on
the list which is really nice like kind
of like moisturizing on the lips and me
out i thought was an amazing color they
also sent latte which was like a warm
brown and i thought that one was really
fun too and then they also sent in food
ooh which is a black one and I was like
I don't have a black lipstick and that's
so cool the like please have in your
collection would have been really cool
for Halloween but so far I thought these
were really nice I war both latte and me
out and I'll have like photos let photos
of them on Instagram as well and also
like a little tutorial demo with these
also but I was a big fan of these I
don't feel like they drive down
particularly Matt or even like looked
mad on the lips but I actually liked
that I liked the way it felt more like a
creamy lipstick that's how it felt to me
at least maybe I need to like wear them
for a longer period of time but me out
and latte especially were really really
pretty and these are fourteen dollars on
the website so they also sent a gold
eyeliner and for some reason I don't
know if it's because I'm sick and I'm
like going crazy but I can't find it on
the website and I actually wore it
yesterday and then left it at my
friend's house so I don't have it in my
possession but they're gold liquid
eyeliner if that was amazing like I was
so impressed with that i know i will
have a demo using it on my Instagram so
if I have that up already i'll leave a
link down below but i thought it was
phenomenal i'm not sure what i'm doing
wrong that i can't find it on the
website right now but i'll leave it like
down below but they also sent along this
flower bomb so I was doing the snapchat
unboxing and I was like wait a second
what is this because it is clear and if
you can see it has a flower in it now I
was like I don't understand so from the
website this is twelve dollars and it
says we've added a new magic pill to our
collection this balm stain applies
unclear and then reacts with your skin's
pH levels uniquely creating the perfect
shade of pink lips just for you wow that
was really cool I haven't tried it yet
but I am very curious to try this one
out so I have lipstick on right now or
else I could have tried it on right now
but super curious about this but this
seems to be like very much in demand
like even on the website it says like
alert due to high demand like if you
want this product buy it now and it's
like the next shipments going out
November 29 so apparently like this is a
huge hit and it's only twelve dollars
pretty cool so I was pretty excited to
see this because this is what I believed
I had seen crispy using so this is the
diamond complexion powder so inside it
looks like this and I was curious about
it cuz I was like I you know kind of
looks like a face powder like a setting
powder website it says no
filter is necessary with this
lightweight buildable complexion powder
finely crushed diamonds illuminates the
skin while imperfections are dulled and
I was like what so I saw crispy use it
as like a highlighter for her cheekbones
and down her nose but then it also says
you can use it as a setting powder to
kind of like blur everything and I was
like we'll wait a second what so I
actually did two different demos for
Instagram and honestly it does work both
ways I was a little bit skeptical of it
because I'm like if it's used as a
highlighter how can it be used as a
setting powder when it that like
illuminate your face weirdly but it
doesn't such a soft glow when I applied
it with a big like kind of more of a
fluffier powder brush the morphe three
and i said it all over the face it
really did kind of blur everything I had
a breakout on my chin now I had
foundation on but I didn't have
concealer on it I didn't have anything
on it and I just used the powder and
went over it with that big brush and it
truly did dull it I was like wait a
second that's crazy and then I took my
highlight brush I took the elf small
paper brush and I highlighted my
cheekbones and then down the center of
my nose and you could see it as a
highlight to I was like what is this
stuff it's like it's like a miracle and
it's out of the packaging because I was
at a friend's house the other night I
took it with me cuz I was like um this
kind of just became my new favorite
thing and that's really weird like it
instantly became a favorite of mine so
its twenty dollars I'm super into it I'm
gonna keep using it but I wanted to let
you guys know that like I'm super into
this was a big fan of the diamond
complexion powder does everything that I
got sent from Winky Luxa so a big thank
you to them I will leave their links and
like the Instagram down below but I was
really excited the the glossy lip balms
I wasn't a huge fan of but the liquid
eyeliner the lipstick the diamond
complexion powder huge fan of I'll let
you guys know keep you informed what I
think of the flower bomb a super super
generous package from Chris Anna Anna
cosmetics so she sent me ten of her
liquid lipsticks oh that was really
awesome that Chris Hanna reached out to
me and asked if she could send me her
liquid lipsticks and when all ten showed
up in the mail I was like blown over I
was shocked I was so appreciative so her
liquid lipsticks this is what the like
outer packaging looks like then
is what the actual liquid lipstick looks
like so i did swatches of all of these
on my snapchat and i have also done lip
swatches for quite a few that i will be
sharing on instagram if i have any up by
the time this video goes up I will leave
them link down below I also be tuned
photos with them and all that good stuff
it's really impressed with these liquid
lipsticks they are all ten dollars again
I'll leave the website and the Instagram
a link down below but I was impressed
with them because they are super
pigmented super pigmented like one swipe
you can see it in my Instagram tutorials
I do one swipe of this and it is BAM
like super impressed with that it also
dries down Matt it's not like in two
seconds it's it dries on that but I mean
within at least a minute it has dried
down Matt I didn't count the seconds or
anything but it was fairly quickly that
it dries down and I thought they were
very comfortable on the lips they do you
know the inner lip and they do you don't
crack and crumble on the inner lip which
most liquid lipsticks do unfortunately
it just is what happens but like the
lighter shades didn't bother me at all
some of the darker shades when it
started to crumble on the inner lip like
some of the pieces were going on my
teeth so that's something to make sure
your butt like you pay attention to but
overall I thought these were really
really good like what lipsticks I was
very impressed with them and she has a
really nice color range from nudes to
vampy colors there's a red in there the
mobs are in there there's some really
fun oranges orange e Browns in there I
was really impressed with these again
I'll leave any Instagram photos or
tutorials down below as well and more
will be coming on my Instagram because I
want to try to do as many as I can just
because I was really excited to get all
10 and then once I started trying them
out I got even more excited about them
but I did think that these were really
really good liquid lipsticks so if
you're looking for a new brand you're
looking for a new look what lipstick to
try check out chris anna and cosmetics
cuz I was pretty impressed with this
forget to mention one thing with the
Christina and cosmetics she gave me a
discount code to not an affiliate code
just a discount code for you guys it's
just Samantha M I'll put it right here
and leave it in the description box
below and it gets you twenty-five
percent of your order so if you want to
try it for yourself you can get
twenty-five percent off with that code
and the names are really fun like they
slay DM me the nudes Netflix and chill
like there was like really fun trendy
names for each one so I thought that was
really awesome so that will be down
there below but then the last two things
i have are both from Influenster if you
guys aren't familiar with influenster
yet i've done a lot of videos about it
they are a company you take surveys and
you write reviews on their website they
have a great app and then they send you
boxes and you get free products in
exchange for reviewing them and talking
about them it's a wonderful service
especially if you're a beauty blogger
it's amazing like this is this these box
boxes have been so incredibly helpful I
will leave influenster link down below
you don't have to be a beauty vlogger
you can be a regular old gal who just
likes to get products in the mail and
then review them on like influenster and
amazon is that thought and that sort of
thing but they did send me the
maybelline superstay 24 box so inside it
came with two different lip colors so I
tried this one which was in constant
toast this was the one that I tried
first because it was more of a pink
color I can leave a photo in here
because I did share on Instagram a
picture of it unfortunately it wasn't my
favorite color just because it was a
little bit shiny and it went on a little
bit streaky and it almost just like what
the shine to it I just wasn't like a
huge fan of it but these stay on so long
which I wasn't sure I really thought
that was a great thing because I kind of
get it off even with like a makeup
remover wipe I used neutrogena oil which
usually takes everything off and this
stuff did not budge like to the point
where was actually kind of uncomfortable
so I ended up not being a huge fan and
myself of it I thought it was really
cool to get this voxbox to be able to
try something unfortunately it didn't
work out the best for me but hey
sometimes that happens still really cool
to be able to try them out Leinster will
send out like more of like the brand
boxes like that Maybelline was or
sometimes they just send you a really
big box with a bunch of different brands
and different things inside like this
one so this is the influenster by bustle
box it was called the flawless a box box
and inside there's there's kind of a lot
of different things so we have some
yogi teas in here I'm actually not a tea
person but I know people who are so I
was going to give these away because I
don't drink it to myself there was some
peas in here what were these these were
from harvest snaps snap icarus lately
salted original green pea crisps it's
open because my husband already got into
them and then my dog got into them true
story he liked him he said they were
good I'm not a fan of peas so I'm also
in there's I thought was interesting was
this doctor teals pure epsom salt
soaking solution so this is what it
looks like I feel like this is really
really handy to have around the house
and like even when I open the box my
husband was like ooh I'm almost out of
Life the salts that we already have so
really cool to have a backup so I was
excited to see that also inside was a
little sample of this simple micellar
cleansing water excited to get this
because I love micellar water I love
cleansing water I thought that was
really awesome to get and then also from
simple was there cleansing facial wipes
I've tried these before they're really
nice I love facial wipes I use them for
a nights where I just don't feel like I
have the time to take off all my makeup
using through move swatches I think it's
awesome and then also in there was this
nail polish color from sinful colors and
crazy cosmetics in the shade miss Claus
thing that was in the box is from
covergirl it's this so Lachy blast pro
mascara this is what it looks like I'm
really curious about that wand I just
recently got this box and so I haven't
been able to try everything so I want to
see what some other people are saying
and then try it out for myself but it
says it's for bold sexy lashes so we
shall see but that was a really fun box
10 times it's fun to get the brand boxes
but then sometimes it's fun to get these
like bigger boxes with a lot of
different things in them because like
you never know when you will need
something like those silking salts and
you're like oh yay now I have it I just
thought it was cool so a big thank you
again to influenster for sending me both
of these packages here's the game with
the flow of this box look like really
excited about it if you haven't signed
up for influencer yet i definitely
recommend it super easy the websites
easy to use the app is easy to use I
think it's awesome gonna be everything
from
halt I feel like I'm about to drop at
any moment they don't like being sick
but hopefully I had enough energy to get
through this video where I wasn't like
boring you or putting you to sleep I
just really wanted to get this film
because so many great companies send me
things and I really thought the days
deserved a video and I wanted to share
my reviews and feedback on some of the
items that I've gotten so I don't know
how long I'm going to be under the
weather for but you know sometimes when
you get sick you can like be functioning
and then I'll be setting your down for
the count you can't get out of bed I was
like I might as well film before I know
that I'm going down for the count but
yeah that's going to wrap it up for this
