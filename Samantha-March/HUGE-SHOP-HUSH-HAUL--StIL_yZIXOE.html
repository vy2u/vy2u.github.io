today's video I got a little extra video
this week it's going to be a new haul
video and I'm gonna share everything in
here from shop hush this this this is
going to be quite a haul I'm really
excited for this I just cut the box
the other night and I was going through
it and I was just so excited I was
having to share a few of the items on at
my snapchat so I'm super stoked to show
you everything that shop hush is sent me
this is not a sponsored video but I did
get all the products sent to me from a
shop hush and we were actually connected
via magic links you probably see magic
links in my description box a lot magic
links is an affiliate to linking website
so basically like when I'm talking about
any products that I'm mentioning in my
videos I will have a link in there from
magic links and it takes you directly to
whatever product is I'm talking about
but then I also earned a small
Commission of the sales
I've been using magic links for I think
over a year and a half now and I've had
a great experience with them and it's
really cool to see them now actually
kind of linking influencers and other
companies and brands together I thought
that was really awesome so of course
everything will have my magic link in
there I do have that stated in my
description box that the magic links are
affiliate links if that makes anybody
uncomfortable but it's a huge huge help
to my channel I can't tell you guys how
helpful magic links has been to me so if
you have a youtube channel if you're an
influencer and you're linking a lot I
would definitely recommend them I've
tried a lot of other affiliate linking
programs and nothing I've really been
able to like get the hang of right away
except for magic links whenever I have a
question anyone is super helpful to me
so I was really excited to do this again
magic links isn't sponsoring this either
they just link to the two of us together
so yeah I will have my link of course
down to magic links down below that one
is a referral link too if you do decide
to join it with magic links but I was
really excited I thought it was really
cool when they said that they could get
me in touch with a shop hush and I
create this hole because I have a lot a
lot in this box here and I'm very
excited about a lot of things but I know
that was a longer intro but I felt like
I had a little bit of explaining to do
but why don't we go ahead and
get started with us all alrighty so this
box is just huge so I'm going to start
off with a few things that have me kind
of the most excited and then go in
through some other things so if you guys
aren't familiar with a shop hush I've
been seeing them you know pretty
recently I've been seeing a lot more
like videos about them and people
chatting about the mount Instagram and
getting a lot of comments myself too of
am I going to purchase anything from a
shop hush and what do I think about them
and asked me if I would and review them
as things like that
very interesting website they have a ton
of different brands on there and brands
that are more well known like NYX
Maybelline Milani covergirl la girl you
know those types of brands are on there
but then also brands that I think what
is getting the most attention is there
are some other brands on there who have
really like do pible products - pretty
well known like I especially like eyes
shadow palettes so I feel like that's
where a lot of the buzz is coming from
and a lot of people seem pretty excited
about it but everything on the site that
I have seen so far is super super
affordable and they just have so many
different options on there when I was
going through it the other night I was
like oh my you could spend hours on the
shelf hush website it's crazy right for
sure we'll have them down below but oh
goodness I don't even know I don't even
know where to begin
ok so a lot of people have been asking
me about bad habit I feel like that's
mostly what I've been getting asked
about and if I will get anything from
bad habit if I will do any comparisons
or things like that so I have a couple
items in here this one is the bad habit
inferno palettes I believe these are $10
this is the infernal palette from bad
habit I am having to film with my ring
light today because it's super super
dark let's just go ahead and do some
swatches look at my poor arm can you see
that I have like faded swatches on there
are some swatches of the bad habit
inferno palette oh wow Wow umm I am
impressed ok so those are some swatches
I'm really impressed like those showed
up those showed up right away they felt
very very smooth I don't know I guess I
think when I think of maybe like a $10 I
don't wanna say knockoff palette but you
know something that is more like of a
dupe palette I just feel like the Koala
maybe won't be there as much but dang
based on the swatches that's pretty good
Ivan after all putting them on my eyes
or anything so take it with a grain of
salt and all but hey that's pretty good
and then I also got the bad habit or a
pallet oh whoa this one wait okay so
there was one that looked really similar
is this the prism I think this one is
like the prism palette doop and then
there's also the subculture Duke here
are some swatches this one is Ora
Wow Wow oh wow okay
okay okay I didn't swatch them the best
I don't usually swatch like that but um
hopefully you can see them pretty good
Wow I don't really know what else to say
that they are swatching so well I have
really high hopes for how these perform
on the ID and then I think maybe it was
this one this is the bad habit retro
love and I think this is the ones that I
thought was similar to the subculture so
here is what which one is this one retro
love so I have my subculture right here
actually so subculture is on the top and
then the bad habit retro love is on the
bottom so yeah I mean extremely similar
I would I want to know your guys's
thoughts too on you know palettes like
this that are very much dupes because I
feel like some people have like zero
problem with it and are very excited for
it and other people kind of don't like
it as much so I want to get your guys's
thoughts too but I know a lot of people
are really really excited over these
palettes from retro love see if I can
swatch these
Wow okay I was like Thor's swatch ever
but those last four are from a retro
love let me know what you guys want to
see because I'm really not sure like do
you want me to do like one eye with
subculture one eye with this do you want
full face with hush makeup I don't know
let me know but I've just been getting
so many comments so when magic links
reached out and you know gave me this
opportunity I was like yes because I've
been getting asked so many questions
like I feel like I cannot say no to this
so this I think this is the last one
from bad habit and this is the Royals
eyeshadow palette and again I believe
all of these about habit palettes are
$10 and this one is really pretty too so
here is what the Royals palette looks
like yeah this reminds me a bit of the
modern renaissance
ooh I don't know if these are gonna
swatch as good though let me try this
one
swatches like our pretty weak especially
compared to the other three palettes
that I just tried those shadows did not
swatch well but again of course you know
I'm just watching I'm not putting
anything on my eyes I'm not reviewing or
anything like that definitely the one of
the Royals palette did not live up to
all of these other three that I tried
but yeah I think those are all the
pellets that I have from bad habit these
are all $10 I'm pretty sure I will leave
them all listed out down below do you
guys have any of these yet let me know
I'm gonna go wipe off some of these
swatches and then I'll just keep digging
into this big ol box and already let's
keep rolling because there's a lot in
here oh my goodness okay so I see a pair
of lashes these are Kara eyelashes they
say they are wispy lashes the a Beauty
Blender in here or a blending sponge
this is from Beauty creations and we
have a beauty sponge and a cleanser I
really like the one from is it beautiful
under or Sephora I can't remember you
really liked that one though so I will
give that a try then I also see in here
I have a couple highlights which I'm
pretty excited about these are from Nabi
I think is how you pronounce them Nabi
these are the dream touch highlighting
powder
so I got sent to different shades I
think the bronze one might be a little
bit too dark for me but this one looks
like it'll be pretty let's see can I
open it oh no it's taped no and I don't
have my tweezers to be able to open it
so that's a mega fail fail Samantha but
got some new highlighters to try and
then also I see some very interesting
brushes we have a foundation brush from
Pro luxe and sorry my ring light is
gonna cause some craziness here but it's
one of those like shaped like a fish we
also got some more brushes and these are
like the like the mermaid brushes they
have like little tails at the end so
that feels pretty soft so like here's an
example of one of the brushes yeah it
does feel pretty nice actually hmm I'll
have to give those a try it doesn't say
what brand they are from though so I
don't I don't know that answer I saw
this the other night when I just opened
the package but there's an item in here
from the ordinary so this is the
hyaluronic acid 2% + b5 it says the
hydration support formula with ultra
pure vegan hyaluronic acid applying a
few drops to face AM and PM before
creams ok hyaluronic acid is really good
for hydration so I'm excited because I'm
dealing with some mega dryness right now
which is really bumming me out so that's
pretty cool and then I see some items
here looking these little plastic
baggies so let's go through these looks
like I see some lip products in here
these are from Oh from clean color there
we go from clean color and these are the
madly matte lip gloss and madly matte
metallic lip gloss so a few different
shades up lip gloss and then I also see
a this is from qia and this is the
double eyeliner pencil and kill black so
it looks like there is one on each end I
wonder if maybe it's like the Tarte one
where one side is that's really all it
says where one side is like the gel
pencil and one side is the liquid liner
and then also from beauty treats this is
the lip care avocado
lip balm which is awesome because I'm in
need of everything I'm in need of like
maiya help right now I feel like I never
get this dry and we're not even
officially in winter and I'm like oh my
goodness what is going on okay so we got
some more clean color madly matte lip
glosses because like I got two more
shades there and then this is from
beauty creations and it is a cool
glitter primer I actually don't have a
glitter primer so that's pretty cool
okay so that's everything that came in
that little baggie and you can put
everything back to try to stay organized
in here and then I see another little
they sent so much stuff I'm like oh my
gosh this is crazy I don't know what I'm
I don't even know how to handle myself
here this is from Oakland and a it is a
wine lip tint a light lasting brilliant
lip tint so that's pretty interesting
let's see here oh my gosh no way it's
shaped like a wine bottle oh please tell
me you really are come out come out my
gosh oh my god if you have like a wine
lover this would be such a hilarious
gift idea oh oh that is so cool in the
shade and we're low burgundy I guess see
another lip scrub in here this is from
Beauty treats and this is an almond
scrub and then I see a couple of nail
polishes in here which is coolest I
really like nail polishes these are both
no this one is from a clean color and it
is it has some like glitter glitter
goodness to it and then this one is from
a Santee and it's their mirror effect
nail polish color shine so I think it
must just be like a clear coat to make
your nails shiny that's pretty cool and
then this is a one of those like silly
sponges I think is what they're called
whole thing of sheet masks like this
looks to be an entirely pull of sheet
mask whoa she must she must be rated
everywhere we have an emoji sheet mask
we're just freakin hilarious oh I really
do like these um collagen gold powder
eye mask I used to have some of these
they're really nice for your under eyes
and then a charcoal face mask which
I will enjoy I'll let this one looks to
be a lip mask which I am obsessed with
those as well and a few more in the back
here we have a black pearl do we face
masks ooh that's interesting and then
the strawberry milk one pack this looks
to be k-beauty and it says it is a
brightening sheet mask also in here I
see the help or cleanup mask looks to be
another Kay beauty product looks like
this is actually just for your nose if
I'm reading correctly put masks on your
nose and around nose and then peel off
then I see another skin care product
here this is the carbonated bubble clay
mask very cool that's lots of skin care
in here - that's awesome and then looks
like I have a little guy here it looks
like this is has some glitters in it so
we got a pack of different glitters
that's cool and I got that glitter
primer so that's pretty sweet guy I had
to cut that off weird leads the mailman
came through the door and areas in her
excitement almost knocked over my ring
light and then almost knocked over my
tripod so well I could talk very very
quickly before we had a disaster on our
hands there but I am about almost done I
see there's another little bag here
looks like there are some more lip
prizes another wine Lipton yes
this one is in shinra's red Shin bras I
I mean I enjoy wine but I would not
classify myself as like a wino or a vino
expert at all so I'm probably saying
that wrong but oh my gosh I think I
might be having like a girls night
coming up soon and maybe doing like
white elephant gift so I want to wait
and see because I love the girls drink
wine and I just think that would be so
freaking funny to put in someone's gift
I think that'd be so cool okay so I have
some more of the madly matte lip glosses
a from clean color so I got like four or
six of those lip glosses and then this
one is a clean color madly matte
lipstick so this one is a regular
lipstick so that was all in that bag and
then I see this guy here is this like a
what is this does this guy like put my
Beauty Blender in here
the first thing I thought of I think all
that's left here is I have a few more
pallets oh wait no but we got another
little bag here though another lip scrub
so many lip scrubs in here this is the
beauty treats strawberry lip scrub his
lashes for days
waterproof mascara from I tell you a
deluxe I think is the brand name it's
not a hundred percent on that and then
these last item in here is the pore
eraser primer also from I tell you a
deluxe yeah that must be the brand name
so got a primer in there so that is
everything in the little bags that they
sent along like holy crap thank you that
is Wow but I have even more pallets to
share with you guys I wanted to get some
of those bad habit ones out of the way
because I'm sure a lot of people are
really excited to see those but I
actually have even more pallets here so
I wanted to end on these this one got my
attention
right away this is the sugar pallet from
a face candy and this is like a tin
Talat kind of similar to like the Too
Faced there are ten pallets so this is
called sugar Oh No one of the one of the
shades fell out little shades fell out
can I pop it back in or do I have to
like glue it ooh
that I'm not sure about but there is
what the sugar palette looks like now
I'm afraid I'm afraid some others are
gonna fall out but it definitely
actually kind of kind of really reminds
me of those sweet peach palette hold on
let me grab my sweet peach fella it's
not an exact dupe because some of the
shades are in different spots but I feel
like there's a lot of comparable shades
in here and that people do dupe videos
this is so hard but yeah I definitely
allowing similar shades in the sugar one
but not exactly the same and not like an
exact replica or anything like that but
that one is the sugar palette I have a
few more palettes here from the Oakland
brand this is the one with the wine lip
tints these are both well this one is a
contour palette and the are these are
kind of like the tin ones as well so
this one looks you know to be pretty
similar to like the Kat Von D shade +
light or something like that this is the
cosmic eyeshadow palette wow those are
some pretty shades and this one
comes with a brush so I also see a
highlight palette oh this is from bad
habit too this is the rosy highlight
palette wow this looks like a glow kit
this looks like a glow kit for sure
hopefully you guys can see that one okay
there are some swatches these swatch
pretty well I think these would make
really pretty highlights I need to try
these again feel free to leave any video
suggestions for me below because like
I'm totally overwhelmed by those haul
there's so much stuff in here that I'm
like what should I do with this so that
is also from bad habit and even know I
have three more from bad habit I
apologize I thought those were my last
and about habit I thought these were
from other brands for some reason but
this is the Aphrodite eyeshadow palette
okay oh yeah yeah this one's really
pretty I did open this one on snapchat I
think this one is the one that's
supposed to be the day before the huda
beauty eyeshadow palette which I do not
have that palette so I will not be able
to say okay so there are some swatches
this is the Aphrodite so once again I
feel like if the bad habit pellets are
swatching so so well - the Royals
palette I remember the Royals didn't get
me too excited but that is looking
pretty darn good I feel like a lot of
people have been really excited about
this one I feel like it was this one
that has got a lot of people chatting so
that is Aphrodite and then I also have
the Athena palette here so this is what
the outer packaging looks like sorry I'm
so excited can you tell I'm is really
intriguing this is the Athena palette
look at this one down here it looks just
like straight glitter oh my gosh it is
it's glitter oh my gosh oh no I feel
like I just destroyed it look what I did
can you see oh no I have to see if I can
do something about that it was like oh
that's weird it's like chunky glitter
okay so there are some swatches from
which one is this the Athena palette
it's like literally it's like gritty
glitter that is so crazy I've never seen
that and then I
a palette you can kind of see that first
one is more of a duochrome - Wow just
got this box in last night and I just
opened it last night of course I didn't
watch anything so I wanted to wait to do
the haul video so I'm kind of like well
I just didn't know what to expect so
this is so much fun I'm having the best
time and then the last one here last one
this is from bad habit this is the mid
summer night this is a 30 shade
eyeshadow palette it's what this one
looks like does have a mirror so here
are a few of swatches from that palette
I will say I don't feel like these ones
were swatching as well they felt a
little bit different from the other
palettes that I was watching from bad
habit but of course again you know these
are all just swatches and I don't feel
like swatches really give you an idea of
how they will perform on the eyes they
give you an idea of color but can't
really judge an eyeshadow palette based
on swatches but I will also say that I'm
pretty excited to try some of those but
have a palettes because the swatch just
got me intrigued okay so that's gonna be
everything a flora my first a shop hush
Hall and I am really overwhelmed like I
said I just got this box the last night
and I very briefly went through it just
to kind of see but I didn't realize how
many items that were like stacked upon
stacked and in bags and I I didn't know
there was gonna be that much in there so
Wow thank you thank you to shop hush
thank you to magic legs for setting us
up together it's like a like a blind
date but thank you I'm very overwhelmed
