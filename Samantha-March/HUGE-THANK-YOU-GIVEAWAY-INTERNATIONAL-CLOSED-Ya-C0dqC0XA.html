so excited for today's video I have this
giant box on my lap because it is full
of items for a big ol YouTube giveaway I
am so excited about this giveaway the
day that you are watching this at Friday
March 23rd is my birthday I will be 31
today I am pre filming a bunch of videos
in advance because I will actually be on
a trip in Arizona at this time we do a
trip each year with another couple
because our four birthdays are all
within about a two week time span of one
another and this year we have planned to
go to Arizona so that's where I am at
the moment and I'm looking outside at
this lovely Isle weather trying to
envision being in Arizona but I really
wanted to post a big ol giveaway video
on my birthday that is what I did last
year last year at this time I actually
posted my 15,000 subscriber giveaway
video and I posted it on my birthday so
it is really really incredible to me to
see in a one year time kind of the
growth of my channel which is has been
so exciting to me thank you guys so much
I love doing these giveaways as a way to
give back and just say thank you for the
support thank you for watching my videos
sharing my videos of recommending me to
your friends I just appreciate it so
much
I had actually started planning and
buying for this giveaway for as like I
was gonna post a 45k giveaway because I
thought I could make it to 45 K by my
birthday and actually 45 came and went
really fast and as did 46 at and so I
was like uh I'm not really sure what to
call this giveaway but I still just
wanted to post it on my birthday the
next milestone that I'll reach will be
50,000 subscribers which is so wild to
me but instead of having it be like I'm
sort of a number giveaway it's just it's
just a giveaway to celebrate it's my
birthday I love my birthday I typically
always do a giveaway on my birthday even
back when I just had my blog I was
always doing giveaways on my birthday's
cuz I just think birthdays are such a
fun time to celebrate and just be
excited so that's what I wanted to do
today and of course just to say thank
you to you guys thank you for a really
incredible year I'm probably gonna get
emotional but thank you for such an
incredible year thirty was a lot of fun
learned a lot I learned a lot over this
past year I've had some amazing times
and I've also had some really low times
in my 30s and I just appreciate the
support and the friendships so much I
felt like this year was just I felt like
this year was truly incredible even
through all the bad times there were so
many good times and so many things to
still be able to be in a positive
mindset for and I thank you guys so much
but I don't want to make this too long
mostly because I have a lot of videos
that I also need to edit so I can have
them ready while I am on my vacation so
I could just sit back and relax and
enjoy but I really want to show you guys
that the prizes so I will go through
this big old box first and then I will
share how to you entered into the
giveaway so why don't we go ahead and
jump into the prices I'm not gonna go
into any sort of particular order here
I'm just gonna be kind of grabbing out
and showing you as I go along so first
up here this is one of my favorite
mascaras this is from a flower beauty

blossom collection eyeshadow palette so
we have a little palette here and from
covergirl this is one of their new lip

Pacifica I have a highlighter in here
from ELF this is their highlighting
holographic duo in blue lagoon from
patch ology this is their new lip
service I really do like this if you
have really dry lips like I do right now
I think this will really come in handy
for you and they send me an extra one so
this is called the lip service it's with
honey vitamin b3 and it just is like a
really nourishing hydrating lip oil so
I've really been liking mine so I
thought I would put that she won in a
giveaway I have a couple of items in
here from morphe I have two of their new
eyeliners which I'm actually wearing one
of their eyeliners today one of their
new gel liners so in here I have this
one is in coffee which I believe will be
brown and then this one is in jet which
I believe is black so we have some
liners there
then I also put in a pair of morphe
lashes they recently came out with
lashes and they sent me their full
collection so this set is in Pasha that
I decided to add into the giveaway I
also have a brush set here this is from
Real Techniques it is their brush crush
shimmer and shine brushes so if you can
see that Philip packaging there there is
two face brushes and then also a
blending brush for the eyes I have some
highlighters in here this one is from I
think it's called Nabi it's the dream
touch highlighting powder I don't think
it has a specific name on it it just
says it's a highlighting powder and then
also from Catrice this is called their
highlighting powder in champagne
campaign another highlighter that I have
in here this is from a dose of colors
this is called the supreme glow
highlighter and I believe this one is in
yes gold is the new black so a
highlighter from dose of colors I also
have it here some eyeshadows of from
colour-pop these are the super shock
shadows I have two different shades here
and do they tell me the shape names on
here there we go it is a special
delivery and then also Whittle so that
one there is in Whittle and then we also
have a special delivery I don't have a
table in front of me so it's really hard
like I have this on my lap I'm kind of
balance everything try not to fall off
my chair that'd be embarrassing so just
moving on next up I have here from milk
makeup this is the blur stick this is
the original blur stick and not the new
luminous luminous one that came out I'm
actually not a huge fan of but the
original blur stick I really do like I
know that these are pricey so I got an
extra one sent to me and I thought it
would be a good thing for the giveaway I
also haven't here from Pier lease this
is their daily lip nourisher with mango
and shea butter I'm really big into lip
products and keeping my lips hydrated
and nourished so you're gonna get that
too in this giveaway and then moving on
I have some more lashes here em another
set from morphe these are in
heartbreaker and then I also have these
ones from a lure and Nicole Guerrero
these are in 143 I have these lashes and
they're definitely my most like edgiest
lashes I would say it there can't they
can't give me like Rex no phantoms and I
wear them and next time I have this
another one here from a color pop this
is one of their super shock cheek shades
so a blush shade this is in parallel you
can see that from colour-pop
and then I have here from Pixie this is
the vitamin wake up mist an item from
Dermalogica that I use quite a bit

purely seer is the blue lotus seed bud
mask so also some skin care and this is
a new item from L'Oreal it's the true
magic lumi glow nude highlighting
palette

earrings i got some earrings from a
bubble bar sent to me and i don't wear a
ton of jewelry myself and i don't wear a
ton of like fun jewelry so when i got
this very earrings i thought that they
were super cute but i thought that i
would pass them along because i just
don't see myself wearing them a whole
ton so we've got a pair of earrings in
there from pathology i have the
rejuvenating i jealous these are really
nice especially to use in the morning
because they kind of help deep puffs and
just kind of like plump up the under
eyes and make you look more awake and
all that fun stuff so those from
pathology will be included the more
skincare of focused items I have here
from Pier this is the Blue Agave mask I
have this mask it's a cut it's called
the energizing peel-off mask it's bright
blue when you put it on your face and
you let it sit for a while and then you
actually do peel it run from pathology
these are the lip gels these are also
really nice especially if you're a big
liquid lipstick lover like me these are
really nice too like if you've been
wearing lipstick all day or like several
days in a row and you just need you just
need your lips to have a little bit of
help again I recommend putting on the
lip gels because they really do help and
then I have it here this is a little set
from defined me it's called the define
me petite I have two perfumes from
defined me you can find the brand at
Ulta and I just think they're really
interesting brand I suggest looking them
up and kind of seen their story but also
their packaging is so cute with like
each little lady having her own like
name her own perfume her own style and I
think it's really cute so you can try
out all of the different perfumes that
they have and there are little minis and
you can see which one is your favorite
this item here is from a sleek makeup

so it comes with two
different of the sleek makeup eyeshadow
