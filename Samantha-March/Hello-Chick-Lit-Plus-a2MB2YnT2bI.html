Samantha March and I run the book slash
women's lifestyle blog chicklet plus
this is my first youtube video I've just
kind of decided to start my channel
after watching a whole lot of YouTube
videos this weekend and stumbling across
the booktuber community and I thought
that was so cool
so I put something out there on my
social media like hey would you guys
want me to start a YouTube channel would
you guys be interested in watching the
videos a lot of people said yes and I
started getting a lot of emails but
suggestions for video ideas and kind of
what people wanted to see already so I
was like okay let's do this so I'm
excited to jump in I really have no idea
what I'm doing but I thought my first
video I could just kind of talk a little
bit about me and what I do and then
hopefully later in the week I can record
some more videos and actually get into
the content of what I want the channel
to be about so again my name is Samantha
March I run chiclet plus it is a book
blog I do book reviews on their other
interviews guest blogs I offer author
services like editing proofreading
marketing things like that and and I
also have so many interests and passions
and so I knew when I started the blog
back in 2009 that I didn't want it to
just be a book blog because I have so
many other things that I like to talk
about so I also do like makeup reviews I
talk about Fitness a lot just kind of
whatever is on my mind or what I'm
buying or using or reviewing that I
think might be interesting or beneficial
to others I'm a huge review person I
read reviews like crazy before I buy
anything so I love being able to do my
own reviews for people because I take
them so seriously as well so that's kind
of what chocolate plus is about I also
am a published author I have three
published novels so far the fourth one
hopefully coming this summer and I also
own marching Inc which is a publishing
company and I'm filming this on a Monday
and we have
on our first multi-author collection
coming out tomorrow which would be
Tuesday April 14th so I'm really excited
for that one to release and kind of a
big year for marching Inc we have a book
plan to go out I think like every two to
three months which is pretty exciting
I do also run CLP blog tours to blog to
our company for authors
I do the freelance work like the editing
and the proofreading and the marketing
and I also work for book trope
publishing and I do marketing and
proofreading for them books is my
full-time job so I am able to work from
my home office which is where I'm at
today
I get to work from home if you follow me
on social media you see I have a dog who
is like the light of my life because she
shows up in a lot of my pictures I did
put her outside while I record it
because she makes a lot of noise and she
usually likes to be in my lap so he
didn't think you guys would wanna stare
at her the entire time again like I said
I'd I think I've been saying like a
million times which I told myself not to
do but here we are it's a little
nerve-wracking the first time you're
talking to a camera alone in your office
but again for real let's just act again
this is my first video and I hope to
have at least a few more recorded this
week I really I hope you're not playing
a drinking game know how many times I
say um because let's get serious
so my first video that I'm thinking
about doing is book reviews maybe
talking about some of the book reviews
that I'll have going up this week and
kind of getting more in depth about on
and then just kind of going from there
so again if you want to comment let me
know what you want to see or find me on
social media I'll try to find a way to
put my links somewhere in this YouTube
video but I don't know if I'll know how
to do that quite yet I'm also recording
a little phone so the quality probably
is not going to be the best even though
this is the brand new Galaxy S a G phone
that I've literally owned for like three
hours because this
morning my phone the scream just
shattered spiderweb cracks everywhere
couldn't even see the screen kind of
turn it on it was miserable so I ran out
right away and bought a new phone I
don't really understand it yet but we're
gonna try to make it work so maybe the
quality will be a little bit better than
what my old phone was actually like
because that was only the s4 but
hopefully it's not too bad for you guys
but I just didn't want to run out and
buy any like crazy equipment or cameras
or whatever if I wasn't feeling very
confident and knowing what I'm doing yet
and knowing this is gonna really last a
long time so probably for the first few
videos or so they'll be off my phone but
hopefully in time we'll keep this going
and I'll have the time to be able to do
it I am really busy
even though I I do get to work from home
but I still I have so many different
hats that I wear and so many people that
I work with that sometimes it's kind of
hard to find the time to eat lunch
breath and then record a video on top of
it so we'll just kind of see where it
goes
thank you for watching and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
