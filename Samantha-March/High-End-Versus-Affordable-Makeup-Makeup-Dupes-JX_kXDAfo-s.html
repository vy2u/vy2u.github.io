in today's video I'm going to be doing
the like very popular video that's going
around right now where I do half of my
face using more high-end expensive
makeup products and the other half of my
face using drugstore and more affordable
products so I've been seeing this go
around and people are talking about
different dupes and I was like you know
what I want to challenge myself to go
through my makeup collection and see
what I have that could be considered
dupes I recently just did the YouTube
made me buy a video and that made me go
through my makeup collection and I
realized how much fun I had doing it and
so I was like you know what I want to go
through my makeup collection and see if
I have any products that are like super
similar to one another that I could
recommend for you guys I'm almost making
this video like my own little challenge
of going through my collection and
seeing what could possibly be dupes I
have not tried these out you know like
some things like shadows and lippies I
tried to swatch on my hand to see if I
could get things that were really close
to one another but other than that I
have not gone through tested these so
these are going to be kind of like I'm
going to tell you right here right now
if I think there's their dupes or any
sort of like similarities to one another
that maybe we could pass off as like
somewhat comparable dupes but yeah I
almost just wanted to like kind of
challenge myself to do it and so I'm
going to challenge you guys to do it as
well because I just thought it would be
fun but if you guys also want to see a
more traditional dupes video where I can
like show swatches or again maybe even
apply to my face if you guys want to see
something more traditional where I'm
actually getting like the formula dupes
the color doobs application dupes just
leave that in the comments below I just
thought that maybe this would be a
little bit of fun and I'm not gonna lie
i've been wanting to do half of my face
with different makeup I just think it
looks like a lot of fun but that is what
we are doing in today's video I hope you
guys will like it and why don't we just
hop into it I'm going to go in with
primers and I have two different primers
that are supposed to be like
illuminating luminizing primers one is
from Maybelline or an illuminated primer
and then the other one I have is from
bugga cosmetics and it is the backlight
priming filter so I'm going to be doing
drugstore high-end drug store hi
let's see if I can remember that
drugstore hyah okay okay so coming in
first with the Maybelline it gives a
nice like subtle glow to the skin
nothing crazy so let's compare it to the
Becca but the Maybelline one is more
like on the pinky side and I feel like
Becca is more on the gold side and I
think yeah the Becca one's going to be a
lot more luminizing in my opinion here
we are with two different primer thought
like I said I think the Becca is just a
little bit more glowy so the Maybelline
I don't think is as illuminating but i
think the maybelline actually like blurs
butter but again that's not what Beckett
likes as it does it says it's just an
illuminating primer for a price
comparison the Becca is 38 the
Maybelline is eight ok so I'm moving on
to foundation this was kind of difficult
for me because i only own one high-end
foundation that is the Clinique beyond
perfecting and concealer foundation the
one that I grabbed that I want to try
it's from Maybelline it is there butter
skin foundation both of these give like
a matte finish to the skin there's
really no luminosity to them both both
of them are supposed to like how this is
it's a foundation and concealer is
supposed to give like a really flow of
slick to the face kind of same claims
with the better skin foundation so I
don't know we'll see I don't know if the
colors are going to be super similar
either but we'll give it a try I am
going to use two different brushes for
this as well simply to not mix the
foundations for this side i'm using the
morphe 10 for 39 it's an amazing
foundation brush 1 i definitely
recommend so the better skin does give
like i'd say like a medium coverage
medium not quite full coverage i think
the clinic is going to be more full
coverage other side i'm going to do the
Clinique i'm going to use my Sigma f80
on this side the foundation is going to
be a little bit darker but I did just
buy it as like my you know summertime
foundation so color match probably isn't
going to be the best but that's
I I don't have anywhere to be after this
which is good i think the clinic one is
going to be a little bit more full
coverage blend really nice into the skin
both feel really nice on the skin like
even though i'd say the maybelline is
like the medium to full coverage on the
clinic is full coverage neither of them
feel like very suffocating to the skin
which i really really enjoy here is the
foundation on both sides of my face the
color match maybe isn't as bad as I
thought it was going to be a Maybelline
is a little bit lighter but both do a
good job of covering any imperfections
that I had on my skin both feel good on
the face blend easily I do also think
that these two why I kind of thought
they would be dupes as well is because
they are super super long-lasting like
if I need to go out all day these are
definitely two foundations that come to
mind because I think they wear really
really well so yeah for price difference
the clinic is a twenty seven dollars and
the Maybelline is 10 the sailors was
another little bit of a tough one for me
too because I mostly have drugstore
concealers but I do have the tart
rainforest of the sea concealer and then
I want to compare that to the maybelline
fit me concealer because the maybelline
fit me is one of my favorites and it's
just like a favorite of so many so i
want to see if these would be similar at
all because also the tart one when the
rainforest of the sea lion came out
everyone was like kind of going crazy
over it so i just wanted to see if we
could maybe find a dupe in here but
let's try it out you tart one this is a
very very light coverage chaser may be
pretty similar I do think the tart I
mean if you can even tell on camera it's
only is more of a lighter coverage if
you can see but lets blend em in and see
how they look killer it blinds out so
well and even though it feels like a
lighter formula I think it does a really
good job of concealing but also
brightening at the same time and it's
not very Creasy which I really enjoy I
also really like the Maybelline because
I don't think it is a Creasy concealer
the better skin from Maybelline I think
is more so I usually have to set it like
I'll do one eye and then immediately set
it with a powder to try to prevent the
creasing I think the Maybelline is a
little bit lighter and shade which i
think the Maybelline is doing a really
good job of brightening you guys tell I
feel like this side is a little bit more
brighter than the tart so the concealers
are on I think the tart did a better job
of like covering dark circles and I
think the Maybelline did a better job at
brightening so I don't think these are
going to be exact dupes for one another
but they're close but I don't think
their exact for the price comparison the
tart is twenty-six dollars the
Maybelline is about six dollars move on
and bronze up the face so I'm going to
be using the too faced chocolate soleil
bronzer it's such a favorites and then
for the Affordable side I'm going to be
using the NYX matte bronzer so let's try
them up it's gonna do a little bronzing
right along here on my cheek bone up on
my temple our balls Matt bronzers I
don't know how similar the shades will
be they looked pretty similar in the
pans but we'll see how they look on the
face it's one was actually one of the
first bronzers I ever bought and I don't
find myself reaching for it a whole lot
and then every time that I do I'm like
wait why don't I use this more often so
I think the two-faced if I'm like being
really picky is slightly more blendable
which honestly kind of surprises because
I did not think that would be like a
deciding factor when it comes to
bronzers but I noticed like what the
Knicks like once I put the product on
the skin it almost is kind of harder to
move around color match is pretty
similar I think the next one is to say a
little bit darker but again they're both
Matt bronzers can you guys tell a
difference I think these are pretty
close and for our price comparison the
two-faced is thirty dollars and the
Knicks is 899 so imma move two eyes real
quick and this really was a challenge
for me I had a couple of like single
shadows and the colour-pop shadows but
nothing that match
up really and I kind of really did want
to do different palates too and while I
don't think these pallets are super
similar they do have similar shades in
them and basically just what I'm trying
to say is that if you guys don't want to
go out and spend a ton of money on an
expensive palette probably when you buy
bigger palettes like this like from
morphe this has 35 shadows you are going
to find similar shades in here and so I
kind of went on a hunt I want to see
what I can find so I'm going to be using
the two-faced sweet peach palette and
then the morphe 35o palette both highly
highly loved palettes and see what dupes
I can find I'm first going to come in
with the shade summer yum which is right
here it's like almost like a reddish
brown shade I put that into the crease
cuz I look might not be like the
prettiest I look in the world but just
trying to see if we can get similar
shades out of here and out of the morphe
35o palette i'm going to take this
middle shade right here it looked pretty
similar to summer young to me but we get
i have not tried these on my eyes i just
watched him on my hands at first was it
honestly I feel like I picked up the
same amount of product on each brush and
I feel like I'm getting way more
pigmentation and color payoff with the
more p shadow can you guys see that are
going to come back in and grab some more
summer young with my other brush just to
try to build up to that morphe color
because that morphia code is not joking
around like that was bomb I've never
used that shade before and that really
blew me away like it I know it doesn't
look like a super exciting shade like in
the pan perhaps but that's some nice
pigmentation so I think we got a pretty
evenly matched now that I came back in
it was two-faced but honestly I'm gonna
have to get more through this one much
more color payoff right away blends very
smoothly and I just think I just think
there's more color there was not
expecting that for a lid color I'm going
to come in with Georgia from the
two-faced calots
on one of my Sigma brushes it's just a
really really light pink color then
coming back to the 350 I'm gonna grab
this second shade right here which
seemed pretty similar to Georgia to me
whoa whoa you guys this is serious this
is no joke can you guys see the
difference and this is using the morphe
palette I am shocked right now whoa this
is so much more pigmented Wow it isn't
as powdery as the two-faced I i I'm
actually really shocked and you see the
difference though that's crazy I still
can't get over I can't can't get over
this Wow so for a price comparison the
sweet peach palette is forty-nine
dollars the morphe palette is 22 and 99
I believe it is so big difference and
I'm giving it to morphe i'm giving it
I'm giving it to morphe that was awesome
any like the winged liner anything I
don't have anything that I think would
be close to dupes but i am going to line
my waterline and i'm going to be using
the it cosmetics waterproof liner in
black and then also the knicks tray
sholay liner also in black so this one
is the it cosmetics this quickly turned
into one of my favorite liners so easy
to use stays in the water line for so
long and i'm going to try the knicks won
this one was my favorite for a very long
time okay so right away I noticed a huge
difference so I think that it cosmetics
one is much more black like I feel like
I need to go in a couple times more with
the knicks and reapply it and it's kind
of like irritating just a little bit but
yes I'm gonna have to give it to the it
cosmetics one such a good line
this one I did like but now like
actually comparing it to something else
it cosmetics wins so the price
difference is it cosmetics I believe
this was $22 and the Knicks treasure lay
is 1199 which is expensive for a
drugstore liner by moving on to mascara
so I'm going to be using the Too Faced
better than sex mascara I'm going to
compare that to the Maybelline lash
sensational these are two mascaras that
I reach for very often i think they are
both really good like when I don't want
to wear false lashes but I still want
very like vibrant ba-boom lashes these
are the two that I constantly find
myself for reaching for so I really
really wanted to compare them and see
what I think so i'm going to go in first
with the Too Faced better than sex
mascara this is like such a favorite
everywhere I'm just going to apply that
guys cannot hear my stomach growling I'm
filming this right before lunch and I am
starving I love this mascara because you
don't need a lot of coats it doesn't
make your lashes clumpy okay and then on
the other side i'm going to use and the
Maybelline the brushes are totally
different the two face brush is very
very large and thick whereas the
Maybelline has this really like unique
curve to it go with the Maybelline I
don't think that you need to use a lot
of coats it clumps up just a little bit
more than the two face but also with the
smaller wand you can really like get
into the lashes so oh my gosh you guys I
like the mapley more that really
surprises me but the Maybelline is much
blacker and it really elongates my
lashes more whereas the two face doesn't
whoa Jay zoom you guys then again you
see the difference that surprises me I
thought to face is going to like knock
it out of the park but I'm gonna prefer
the Maybelline that's another one that
really surprises me dupes I don't know
if I feel like they are super super
similar they both do a good job
making the lashes longer again
Maybelline I think ones here maple ink
is also much darker but the two face
kind of makes the lashes look a little
bit more fluffier whereas the Maybelline
just kind of like takes each lash and
makes them longer so i don't think i
would consider them dupes for one
another but if you are looking for
mascara that will really take place the
false lashes like you don't want just
like a casual mascara you want it to
really do something these are both
really good options I just actually
prefer the Maybelline and for the price
difference the two-faced is $23 and the
Maybelline is 7 so I'm going to finish
off my face and I'm going to come in
with blush just kind of hard to because
I don't have a lot of high-end blushes
but I do have the new Becca cosmetics
and Jaclyn hill face glow palettes and
there's this blush right ear which is
called Pamplemousse and it's a very like
vibrant coral it has a little bit of
shimmer in it to compare that to my
Milani and Dulce pink looks like this so
again it's a pretty like vibrant pink I
don't think as vibrant as the
Pamplemousse but has some shimmer in it
too so how comparable they are okay so
first I'm going to go in with the
Pamplemousse very pretty very pigmented
I'm being very careful of how much I'm
putting on my brush which is a very
pretty coral pink use this one several
times I don't think it's as pigmented so
I'm just being very generous it was like
swirling the surround of the blush I
would not do that with the beckon
checkland blush both pink and are both
have just like a little bit of shimmer
to it but the Milani I feel like I would
need to keep building up to try to get
it to that same color as the Jacqueline
one so here are the blushes of both on
so I actually think this one has a more
shimmer to it and this one is just more
of like the pink coral just like a
little tiny bit of shimmer in it the
rose i spritz from this palette which is
on the side right here this one
definitely has a lot of shimmer to it
but it's more of a peach in my opinion
versus a pink but I
thinks these are very similar both very
pretty on their own not super similar
and I actually really do like the
Pamplemousse more than I thought I would
I thought it might be a little bit too
like Brighton in your face but it's
really thought so that's cool I'm to do
a price comparison I mean this whole
palette was $52 but if you just take
like a becca blush they're like thirty
to thirty four dollars so that's the
price comparison i would give so 3234
for the back of blush and then the
Milani i'm finding 47 it last but not
least are the lips now I actually had a
really hard time with this and I did not
think I would I thought I would have so
many Dukes my collection because I'm
attracted to so many of the same color
that I was like Shirley I'm gonna find
so many dupes I had my whole hand
covered in swatches and I was like this
is actually a lot harder than I thought
but it also made me happy because I've
literally been sitting here for months
thinking I just have like 10 of the same
lipstick shades and that's really not
true but the two that I want to compare
our the kat von d bow and arrow such a
gorgeous brown nude and then bieber from
colour-pop which again is like the brown
nude I think this might have liked a
little more hint of gray and this might
have more of like maybe like a pinky
brown undertone but i swatched him on my
hand they looked pretty similar so let's
see how they look on the lips I also
think this is going to be really weird
doing half my lips in two different
lipsticks this is going to be odd but
let's try it and let's see it first i'm
going to come in with the kat von d so
there is bow and arrow how do I look
looking good other side i'm going to do
beeper from colour-pop so as i'm
applying it i think the beeper is a
little bit darker but i want to see how
it drives down the kat von d has a much
lighter like formula the colour-pop is a
little bit heavier but again i'm just
going to let them both drag down so we
can kind of compare the colors so
they've dried down a little bit they're
not completely dry yet but i do think
the kat von d is a much more
lighter and then the beeper is darker
than the bow and arrow so again not
complete dupes but they are both really
pretty like nude nude Browns if that's
what you're looking for but darn i kind
of thought they would be even closer and
color they looked really close watched
on my hand that's okay because they're
both still very pretty colors for a cost
comparison the kat von d is twenty
dollars and the colour-pop is six
dollars comes to how long lasting I
think they are I don't know I almost
want to say that it's a tie I don't
think either of them are like super
duper long lasting like you can get away
with wearing these entire day without
doing any touch-ups I think they both
definitely do need touch-ups they both
can kind of do the inner rim thing but
with lighter more nude colors like these
you don't notice it quite as much than
what's like something a lot darker
there's a certain formula i prefer for
glowing price-wise then color pop
totally winds and they have so many
different shades like their shade
selection is insane actually forgot to
do a highlight I was like getting
writing like wrapping things up and I
was like oh yeah did do highlight I've
actually been kind of giving myself a
break from highlighting my cheekbones
just because I've been dealing with like
some texture and highlighting kind of
emphasizes that so I've been like trying
to give myself just a little bit of a
break before I really start kicking into
gear for summer but of course I wanted
to try to do highlights for this video
so let's see so almost all of my
highlighters are on the more expensive
side so it was really hard for me to
find in my collection what I could use
as the Affordable highlighter and I'm
sorry because this one is actually not
in stock anymore so that's why even when
i realized i forgot the highlighter i
was like should i still do it but i kind
of want to test it out and see so i'm
going to be using mary-lou manizer from
the bomb and then puppy love from a
color pop this is technically like
classified as an eyeshadow but I mostly
use it as a highlight I'm just going to
use my finger and give myself a little
bit of shine so this is the bomb a
little bit of a glow just to see then
I'm going to dip a different finger into
puppy love from colour-pop doing that I
just hit
and whoa I knew it was coming soon I
knew it was coming soon but well okay we
just we just had a moment together okay
and then I'm just going to place puppy
love on to the cheekbones what do you
guys think so i think they are bullets
like pretty bright puppy love almost has
more of like an iridescent sheen to it
which is like really in right now with
highlighters where the lou manizer is
more of like that I see traditional
highlighter both very pretty i don't
think they are really duped if you have
puppy love and you haven't tried it out
as a highlighter yet freaking do it
because it's really really really really
pretty but mary-lou manizer from the
bomb is one of like the first
highlighters that i purchased and i
think it's amazing so not totaled oops
which I didn't think they would be but
still very pretty on their own
comparison I believe I spent twenty
three dollars on mary-lou manizer and
then the colour-pop is five okay just
wanted to make sure we got highlight in
here how they don't leak so this is my
final face this side is using all
high-end products this side is using
drug store / affordable products so that
was a really interesting challenge to
take it was a lot of fun to try to go
through my makeup collection and see
what I think would be duped and then
actually put them to the test and not
only see how similar they are to one
another but which ones I think are
better I was surprised by a lot of
different things I was surprised that i
liked the morphe 35o actually better
than the two-faced sweet peach palette
they're both some of my favorite
palettes and I really thought the two
face would beat the morphe the mascara
certainly surprised me I thought to face
once again would like below maybelline
out of the water so that definitely took
me by surprise I wish the lips matched a
little bit more but that's okay like I
said I don't have anywhere to go so I'm
probably just going to wash this off the
foundations I thought were pretty
similar the concealers weren't quite on
the same page but I think they both work
so well it was interesting to see the
the more affordable products that i
actually ended up liking better so i
mean if this video can tell you guys
anything it's that you don't need to
spend a lot of money to get good makeup
and to get good quality makeup
the drug store and the Affordable brands
are doing so well right now don't feel
like you need to go out and buy a bunch
of high-end stuff and that's going to
make your makeup better because that's
really not the case I hope that video i
hope this video showed that for you it
was a lot of fun making this i know it's
not a like traditional dupes video but i
still hope you found it helpful in some
way to see what the different
comparisons could be i hope it
challenges you to go through your makeup
collection and see if you guys can try
to pair out the dupes like it really i'm
taking this on as like this was a
challenge now a traditional dupes video
but definitely a challenge to go through
my collection was a lot of fun doing it
that is going to be it for this video I
hope you will give it a thumbs up if you
did like it if you guys do want to see
the more traditional dupes video please
