much for stopping by because I'm so
excited for this video this is going to
be my first collaboration video and I'm
just so excited it's going to be a
makeup tutorial on this look right here
I have collaborated with beauty addict
next door at her name is Alex I believe
she lives in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and
she contacted me on instagram and asked
if I would want to do a holiday
collaboration luck with her I did an
affordable makeup look so all the makeup
products I used and the brushes that I
used are from more affordable lines or
drugstore lines and her video is going
to be the more high-end products I am so
excited I'm so thankful that she asked
me to do this I wanted to do a
collaboration for so long but I've been
too scared to reach out to anyone
because I'm like I'm just starting I've
only been on YouTube for a few months
like probably no one's gonna want to do
anything with me so when she asked me I
was like yes please yes it is so much
fun it's been so great getting to know
her a little bit more I will like leave
her picture up here so you guys can see
it and of course i will link to her
channel below and then also for her
makeup tutorial video that she has done
as well i will have both those links in
the description box and i do hope that
you will go check out her look because
i'm sure it will be gorgeous but i think
it's so much fun to connect love being
able to meet up with people you know
online and talk with them more and get
to know them more I mean that's
basically what my entire career is it's
me sitting at home but talking to so
many other people in all different parts
of the world and I just think it is so
cool so I'm if you can't tell I don't
know how many times I've used the word
cool or like excited so far on this
video but i just am very excited i hope
you guys like this look there is one
like minor mishap that happens hopefully
you guys can get a kick out of that even
though I was pretty frustrated when it
happened but yeah if you guys would like
to see how I got this affordable holiday
makeup look please keep watching okay so
the first thing I'm going to do is prime
my eyes because I'm going to go in with
my eyes first and I'm going to use this
instant a three whined concealer this is
from Maybelline I like to put it on my
eyelids and then all the way around my
eyes and that's one thing so that's what
I'm going to do first I'm going to buff
that out with my morphe G to brush this
is their concealer brush I got it in my
first morphy hall so I'm just going to
be blending that out I still looks like
I still have a little bit of eyeliner on
from last night that's that's not good
but I'm filming this on a Friday I'm
filming this the day after the thursday
night football game with the packer whoa
so i apologize i apparently didn't do an
excellent job getting my makeup off last
night but of course we watched the game
and then we had to watch the post game
and then we had to watch all the
interviews like holy crap what a feeling
to be on the right side of a Hail Mary
okay so this next step I don't know it
might seem kind of weird but I was
watching I think it was one of Carly
Bibles videos and this look kind of like
the look that I was slightly recreated
recreating when I did this like the
first time and I don't think it turned
out exactly like her look was but I
ended up really liking it and so instead
of trying to do it a different way for
this video I was like I'm gonna do it
exactly like how I did the first time
because I loved it so much and I went
out that night and I had so many
compliments so what I did next when I
was recreating this look was I used this
psycho fat I stick this is what it looks
like and basically this is just like a
grayish silver it's like a like an
eyeshadow base Alou it's just it's
always been in my collection and
sometimes I'll use it but very rarely i
don't but in Carly's video she used it
looked like this i can't think exactly
what she called it but it was black and
she was doing like a really intense
smokey I grabbed this I have this one
and a really similar one that was purple
and I was like I'll go with the gray
because it's lighter than the purple and
that I had and I don't know it just
worked out for me I liked it you guys
can do it you could not do it I'll link
Carly's video below as well if you guys
want to see it so you can see what I'm
talking about but yeah I'm going to take
this and I'm going to put it on like the
outer V of my eye and like just the
outer V and this I'm not trying to make
it perfect or precise or anything like
that and just placing it on there
because we're going to cover it all up
with shadows but I don't know I thought
it it made the I look cool to me because
it seemed like the shadows for different
from like for the base that I applied
and then to the other part I thought I'd
gave it a cool look and I i think this
helped with the process ok so then i'm
going to move on to doing the rest of my
shadows so this look I mean it really
only have like two eyeshadows the one
eye shadow i use is like the star of the
show and then i use like a blending
shade like a transition shade but i am
using my morphe 35t palette I do have a
full video breakdown of this palette so
these are what all the shades look like
I have the full video breakdown of it I
show all the swatches of everything and
I do a makeup tutorial this palette is I
use it so much and I was when we decided
to do this video I immediately thought
of the look that I had done least I
thought it was kind of holiday ish and I
was going to do it I was like well I
just did that more free video so like
should I try something else but I was
like I love the way the came out
and I really wanted to recreate it but
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take
my like flat shader brush from
bhcosmetics
mix and this is something my eyes
bothering me this is like a synthetic
brush and I think it helps with this
particular shade because there's a lot
of like shimmer to it I think the
synthetic would help more than like a
regular brush but then I am also going
to spray it this one is from Victoria's
Secret and normally I would do mac fix+
um that's what I did the first time
that's what i normally spray my brushes
with if i know that i'm going to be
working with something that i really
want to make it pop I will usually use
the mac fix+ but I think this is going
to do the same thing and it's a cheaper
option and because I'm doing more
affordable that's what i wanted to share
with you guys this i just got from
victoria secret i think it was like ten
dollars twelve dollars and it says it's
a make it make it last prime and set
makeup spray so this is what i'm going
to use at the end and everything's done
i must bring my face with it so i'm also
going to spray my brush with it shade
i'm going to be using it's the third row
and it's the first one right here and i
can do a close up picture for you guys
too so you can see it but this is one
that like I kind of skipped over I
didn't really notice it much at first
and then when i swatched it for the
video I was like wait how did I miss
this color because it's almost kind of
like a duochrome and it's just I don't
know it looked so beautiful so I'm going
to put that on my brush and then pack it
on and just put it all over my eyelid
I don't know if you guys can tell it's
like it's like a berry but it's got like
flecks of green in it may be a little
bit of silver like when you turn your
eyes like it kind of turns a different
color and then where I placed that like
silver like chubby stick kind of where I
place that at the end like I just
thought it brought more dimension to the
eyes and I just really loved it so this
I'm not putting on very precisely either
I'm just kind of packing it all over my
eyelid and then I'm going to take like a
soft brown and kind of blend it all
together and make sure like there's the
no harsh edges type of looks that looks
more blended but that is all I'm doing
and you can you know put on as much as
you want okay can you guys I don't know
I really hope that the camera picks us
up because I've just so in love with
this color I think it's so cool I know
dual Chrome's are really popular right
now too so when I found that one in this
palette I was like wait a second I
didn't even know this one was in here so
i don't know i just i love the way it
looks but now i'm going to go in with my
morphe g13 this is a blending fluff and
i'm going to use it because my blending
brush that I have from bhcosmetics it's
a it's a bigger blending brush and I
think it's going to be a little too
fluffy for what I want and then my other
more precise brush is from sigma i think
it's the e 40 but that is not on the
Affordable side so I really wanted to
try to use like everything affordable on
here so this one is a little bit more
precise I actually like it more for
packing product on than I do for
actually blending but I think it will do
the job just fine it's going to take a
light brown shade so this is right above
the main shade that we used it is just a
light brown trade perfect for a
transition color I'm going to put a
little bit on my brush and then blend it
into the crease and just kind of help
make sure we don't have any harsh edges
and just kind of help give it a more
blended look do the blending process I
mean as many times as you feel you need
to do it until you get it to the look
that you want it to um
if you guys after you place this first
shadow and if you do a really precise
job or you just like you don't think
that you need to blend it out I mean by
all means skip this step but it's just
something that I really like to do ok so
once you have it blend it out to where
you want it now so mine so I blended it
out but I tend to blend out like far and
then after I do my eyeliner I come in
with either a makeup wiper concealer and
then I clean it up so I know it might
look a little crazy right now but the
end result will get there it's like a
weird weird makeup process it go in and
do my eyeliner and then I'm going to
move on to face for a little bit so I'm
going to use this next two timer
eyeliner it has a Kohl eyeliner on one
end and then it has a felt tip liner on
the other end now I use a lot of like
the Maybelline gel eyeliner and I know
I've used a lot in my tutorials so I
wanted to do something different I just
recently got the kat von d the trooper
eyeliner oh my gosh that thing is
amazing that was like the bus eyeliner i
think i've ever used the knicks the felt
tip side it's ok i don't think it's
super black and I don't know this felt
tip I just I had a little bit of a
struggle getting used to it at first but
i think i'm getting better with it now
the Kohl eyeliner I don't like it at all
it really doesn't it really doesn't even
go on well at all and then it doesn't
stay either but I like the the felt tip
side a lot better since i'm going to do
to make my wing guys something is
driving me crazy what is on me i'm going
to do to make my wing
I'm going them pretty dramatic today I
think because I don't know I just really
want it like a bold winged eyeliner so
that is the look I'm going for and again
you can clean it all up with with a
makeup remover pad or concealer if you
decide that you don't like it like
sometimes I bring mine too far down and
then you can just take it and clean it
all up ok so now I'm going to move on to
face and first thing I'm going to do is
prime going to be using the Maybelline
master prime by face studio this is
their blur and illuminate primer it's
actually I believe the only primer that
I have drugstore I also i'm a big fan of
like the two face primers but i just put
it a little bit on the back of my hand
and then i'm just going to smooth that
over my face my skin isn't too bad but i
just started a new skin care routine and
so like my chin is a little mad at me if
you can see my chin is a little bit red
but i started i got the first aid beauty
like they're all I camera brought it was
called but they had like a five piece
package I think it was from Sephora on
sale and I about it so i've been using
it and it has broke me out a little bit
but I'm okay with it because a lot of
times like if you start new skincare and
it does break you out it usually means
that it's working so hopefully fingers
crossed it's working but I just started
it like three days ago so hopefully this
will clear up and the musk and i'll be
looking good in no time i'm actually
going to mix two foundations together
I've been doing this technique for
probably like the last three weeks and
I've just become obsessed with it so
what I'm going to do is take the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi this is w5 and sand
beige and then i have the l'oreal true
match with shade is listen this is an N
seven classic tan and I'm just going to
put a drop of this in to the L'Oreal
foundation
it just helps give me a little bit more
color than like this one is just a
little too light for me I like the way
it makes my skin look because it does
make it look more like luminous and dewy
which is what I like but it's just a
little too light and especially because
I'm pale right now because we're in the
winter like I feel like it's just
accentuates how pale i am and so just
putting a little drop of that into it I
think really helps my color this one
does have a pump so I put like two and a
half pumps on to the back of my hand and
then I just put this doesn't have a pump
or anything so I would be very careful
and I just put one little drop on their
mix them together with my finger oh
that's what the color looks like if you
can see that and then i'm using my
morphe and 439 foundation brush I love
this brush you guys I oh man I love it
so much it is so soft I have a sigma
foundation brush and like when I first
got this brush I was like I don't know
if it's really going to work out for you
because it's so soft I was afraid it was
just going to like absorb the product
instead of like actually putting product
on my face it doesn't do that and now
that i've been using it i used my sigma
one once and i was like oh it's hurting
my face because these bristles are so so
soft like I'm obsessed with it I feel
like I'm cleaning it every other day
because i'm using it everyday feel them
holding my mirror super awkwardly sorry
about that bringing my foundation down
onto my neck you know into my hair up
into my hairline all that good stuff
over onto my earlobes i'm going to
highlight a little bit and then also use
it to clean up my eyeliner because this
side I think turned out pretty good this
side I feel like just needs a little bit
of help but i'm just going to use my
maybelline it's their fit me concealer
it's in
shade 10 light and put that in all the
normal highlight areas which is under my
eyes my forehead down the bridge of my
nose Cupid's ville chin I tend to get
the dark circles like up in here so I
bring the concealer up in there I'm
going to bring it along under my eye and
then this is where I'm going to use it
to sharpen up that wing and again I'm
just going to blend out with the morphe
g2
then I'm going to set that concealer
with this Rimmel stay matte translucent
powder then I have my ELF small tapered
brush and that is the like my favorite
brush to use to set to my under-eye
concealer I'm going to use a little bit
of bronzer to help give me a little bit
more dimension on my face and then also
like slightly bring it into the contours
as well I don't do like full highlight
and full contour a lot of times I'll use
my by bronzer shade to like kind of
contour but I'm not totally there yet
but we're working our way up there like
I don't have a contour kit I did have
one from bhcosmetics that I ordered like
two years ago and I actually broke it
and dropped it and that happened but I'm
actually then use this BH Cosmetics
brush it has like this nice angle to it
which I think helps like when you are
wanting to contour and then I'm going to
use my NYX matte bronzer it's in the
shade medium this isn't my favorite one
to use when I want a bronze and contour
as well because I think it's a little
bit more on the warm side and for the
contour I think it's better on the more
like gray a she sighed at least for me I
think it looks a little bit better um my
too faced chocolate soleil bronzer i
think is a really good one for that but
we're gonna make it work
I'm going to move on to the eyes and
finish them out but before I do that I'm
just going to go through with this Real
Techniques brush it's actually a blush
brush but I use it to like blend
everything out its really soft as well I
honestly I am not totally positive how
much this is if this is considered I
don't know if Real Techniques is
considered more affordable or more
expensive but ID I know I got this at
alta so but it's my only like blending
brush that I do for this so I didn't
really know what what else I could pull
I'll leave all the products linked in
the description box below and all the
brushes that i'm using all that will be
in the description box in my waterline
i'm going to use the knicks Trey sholay
it's their gel eyeliner pencil this one
is definitely worth the money it's a
little bit more expensive for Nick's i
think it was like eleven dollars but it
stays in the water line so well and then
i'm going to smudge this it's like a
deeper brown shade i'm going to smudge
that on my lower lash line just to give
it a little bit more oomph and i'm just
using this like a large pencil brush
from bhcosmetics mascara i'm going to
use that define a lash this is by
Maybelline this is totally on its last
leg like hard but I don't have any other
drugstore mascara if anyone has any good
recommendations let me know I really do
like this one for the bottom lashes I
think it does a really great job for
them and then I'm just going to kind of
like casually put them on the top
because I'm going to come in with false
eyelashes so it's going to kind of prep
my top lashes for the falsies ok so I'm
going to go do two things off camera one
is I'm going to fill in my eyebrows and
I'm going to use the NYX micro brow
pencil for this I am very new to doing
my eyebrows and like I'm like all up in
there and I need both hands on my face
so
hold of me r at the same time is
probably not going to work so I'm going
to do that off camera but then I'm also
going to do my lashes just because it's
a lot easier for me to do it but i'm
using the duo lash adhesive it's my
favorite lash glue adhesive out there it
is the dark it's like the gray color so
i just feel like that helps especially
when you have black liner the lashes
that i'm using are from our dell and i
think it's called like their natural
wispies or something like that I will
find the exact name so i can link it in
the box below for you but our dell is
fabulous lashes their drug store they're
affordable i love them so i'm going to
do these quick off camera ok so that
actually did not go as planned because i
don't know what is wrong with those
eyelashes but like the left one was fine
and then i would try to put the right
one on and the corners would not say on
I took the ideas of off and I tried it
again wouldn't stay on and it was like
comical because I would push down like
the inner corner and the outer corner
would pop up when I pushed down the
outer corner in the inner corner pub
like I was going to try for a third time
and then I'm like you know what I don't
have the patience for this so I'm really
bummed because I feel like with such a
bold liner like you need eyelashes and I
don't know if I have any other eyelashes
in my bathroom upstairs but Mike
whatever so I am NOT very impressed
those were the first time in it I had
bought these are Dell like the natural
ones and I'm not going to buy those
again so that's a bummer but we're just
going to move on real life happens I'm
going to move on to blush and this is
from colour-pop it is there between the
sheets blush and I'm going to use my
morphe em 427 it's their duo fiber blush
brush you really do need like a duo
fiber brush when working with the
colour-pop blushes because their formula
is is very different so using a regular
brush bullet using a regular brush
it just doesn't really make the color
pop or last as long I found so I really
really like this one from morphe still
cannot get over that that happened I
don't know if that has ever happened to
me with any eyelashes before like I I
cannot remember a time that I could not
get a pair of eyelashes on that just
that just blows my mind and of course
it's the one time that I'm filming you
know because why not okay then I'm going
to go in for a highlighter and I'm going
to use a cream and then also a powder
now i will say that i have not really
found like a favorite drugstore
highlighter anyone has any
recommendations please do let me know
because i would love to check them out i
really like from becca cosmetics I like
the champagne pop and I like the opal
and from Benefit Cosmetics I like there
what's up i also like mary-lou manizer
from the bomb those are like my top
highlighters but these I mean they work
fine alone I really don't like them but
together I like them a little bit more
but again these are really like my only
affordable option that I could use but
yeah if you guys have any
recommendations please do let me know
but I'm going to use the Revlon
Photoready skin lights in pink light I'm
going to put this on first on the tops
of my cheekbones as the cream and then
I'm going to go ahead and layer the
powder on top
and the for the powder i'm using the
Maybelline master highlight its they're
highlighting bronzer which honestly
makes me no sense to me and the shade is
light bronze like this is what it looks
like on the inside but I don't know how
you would use this as a bronzer and it's
shimmery so I don't go I get it but i'm
just going to use my finger again and
then i'm just going to put that on over
that cream i'm also going to put it down
the bridge of my nose and then a little
bit on my Cupid's bow as well like i
just don't think the product really
stands out and i don't think it lasts a
considerable while so yeah if anyone
does have more affordable highlighters
to share please do because i would like
to know them so i'm going to do a red
lip and i think this look could either
would work well with a red lip or a nude
lip but i feel like i've done nude in my
past tutorials and i haven't really done
anything with red I'm not a big red
lipstick person but for the holidays I
mean red is kind of like the go-to so
I'm going to align my lips with this
sedona red liner and this is from
Jordana these are super super affordable
and then for the lipstick color I'm
going to go in with this l'oréal's
Blake's red it's from like one of their
celebrity collections and it's a really
beautiful red
okay so then the final thing I'm going
to do is spray my face with a victoria
secret makeup prime set makeup spray and
this makeup look is complete this is the
final result I hope you guys like this
video even though we had an incident
happen I'm really I'm gonna go up into
my bathroom and look and see if I have
any more eyelashes because we're going
up tonight and so I was excited to do
this look and then be able to go out but
I really i think this look needs
eyelashes so if you guys have any good
recommendations for eyelashes please do
let me know i just recently asked on my
instagram as well and some people
comment it and said ardell I'm like
that's all I use right now though is our
dell i'm looking into like who to beauty
