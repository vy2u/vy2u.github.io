just gonna be doing a quick little
chitchat about a question that I could
ask quite a bit with running chiclet
plus and that is where do I get my books
that I review I did record kind of like
a why I started chicklet plus video and
I touch on that in there when I thought
I would just do a quick little video I
get emails a lot from people asking you
know what do I need to start a book blog
do you have any advice or tips and then
where I get my books is asked in almost
every email you'll think that it's
really expensive to start a book blog
and that they have to go out and buy all
these books and you know are they able
to afford it so I thought just thought I
would make this quick little video to
maybe help some of you out if you're
thinking about starting a book blog I
mentioned in my previous video that when
I started all I was doing was like going
to the library I mean it doesn't take
anything to have a library card
volunteered at a library hungar years I
can't think of how old I was but I did
it for a few years I volunteered after
school and on the weekends at the
library and I thought it was amazing you
know I've always been bookish my whole
life so being able to work and be
surrounded by books I just thought was
the coolest thing I would babysit a lot
as well and with each of my charges you
know we had a library day that we would
plan out and I would take them to the
library we'd get books and but that is
my my number one tip I would say is get
your library card and go to the library
and get those books that you want to get
one would just be do you have any books
on your bookshelf you know start with
those and those could even be books that
you don't need to reread you've already
read them just go ahead and write your
reviews put them put them on your blog
write write your thoughts down on them
you know some maybe it's been a while
since you've read them so you might need
to reread them but but that's okay and
that's an expensive and you have them
right there so great news another great
way and the
what I did as well is swap with your
friends I am lucky to have a few friends
that are interested in books I honestly
really don't have that many bookish
friends either which is why it's so
amazing to create a book blog because
now I feel like I have all these friends
and all these different areas and we can
talk about books virtually I've even
been fortunate enough to do some events
where I got to meet these other bloggers
and authors and readers and that is so
cool and I completely credit my book
blog for letting me be able to do that
but if you do have any friends or family
members that like to read and have some
books that you can you know do a book
stop with or just ask hey can I borrow
such-and-such book then there you go
then you have another way that's you can
review books so those are kind of the
three things that I did when I was first
starting the library books of my own and
borrowing from friends it's even like
going to garage snails we I live in Iowa
and garage sales are a huge thing like
garage sale season is coming up and I'm
so excited because okay so our garage
sales in this area I mean it's not like
you just go to a garage sale and you get
a few things like there's houses that
sell like breakfast burritos and rice
krispie treats and all these amazing
things and so when I know it's Gracchus
all day I'm just like you know I get
really excited about it
but garage sales are a great way to find
books too and yes you have to buy them
but usually they're fairly inexpensive
we also have where I live in town we
have what's called a half-price
bookstore and there are books there that
are a lot cheaper than what they would
be at maybe like a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble or
buying online it's also kind of cool
people can take in their books and they
get paid to drop their books off and you
can either get paid I think it's either
you get paid if they you know think your
book is worth money or else you can just
donate it to the store which i think is
cool because sometimes like I'm looking
at my bookshelf right now and there's a
lot of books on there
so maybe I should make a trip because I
got a lot going on there's it's
overflowing it's not cute at all I
promise I'm going to clean my office so
I can give you guys an office tour but I
promise that's coming yes so those are
kind of the things that I did when I was
first starting and then I was very
diligent in my book blocking I got up
several reviews a week and after I think
it was like three months of doing these
reviews the way that I was doing them
then I started to be approached by
authors and publishers and agents sort
of thing asking if I would review other
you know their works and they would send
me a free copy for me to review so you
know and it's it's an exchange deal
they're not just gonna send me free a
free copy and I leave it on my Kindle or
I leave it on my shelf and I don't touch
it again you know when someone sends me
a free copy I try to do as much for them
as I can
I tried to mention them in my mailbox
post and and give them a hey this is
coming up I always put on chocolate plus
and now my social media pages what I'm
reading so every single book that I read
gets featured so I try to you know
feature everyone and that way too and
then I also do the review for them so
you know I'll say this from my author
point of view it's not fun to just give
out your work and have nothing to show
for it it's really sad when you send a
free copy of your book out to someone
and then you never hear from them again
you don't get a review you don't give
any sort of mention you know it takes a
long time to write a book and if you're
in the self-publishing area or the indie
area it's it's pricey to you know it
cost money to hire an editor and a
proofreader and a cover designer and
then you have to pay for your marketing
if you say that you're going to review
someone's work and you get a review copy
please really do review the work because
it is so appreciated leave your
views on Amazon I I just I know from my
author point of view that is such a huge
thing so real quick now that I've gone
off on a tangent like I always do
oh and they would ask me you know I'll
give you a real copy you reviewed the
book and that's how I started doing it
and honestly I have chicklet plus has
been running for five years and that's
pretty much the only way that we do
reviews right now is because we're
requested from authors publishers and
sometimes I do have a review team so
sometimes they'll buy a book or know
someone who wrote a book and they'll ask
me if it's okay to review that on
chuckle plus which i think is amazing of
course but I would say probably 90% of
the reviews that are posted on chocolate
plus come from the authors themselves a
lot of those are also for blog tour
companies I run CLP blog tours blog to
our company someone had asked me if I
could do a video on blog tours and what
that means and yes I will I have that
written down and I will most definitely
do a video blog blog tours I think
that's so cool but someone asked for
that so thank you yes I will the books
don't just come from CLP blog tours I
work with a lot of other blog to our
companies as well and maybe when I do
that video I can post like links to all
these other tour companies that I know
really well if any authors are out there
watching and trying to figure out how to
get some more marketing going for them
that'll be a really good video for you
guys to watch so but yeah so see if you
blocked or several other tour companies
you know the owners of the companies
email blog - hello email book bloggers
and you know ask will you review the
book or will you promo it on your
website or that sort of thing so we get
books from there too but that's that's
where the majority of our books come and
like I said it took me a few months to
get there it wasn't like I just put a
book blog up and all of a sudden all
these people were knocking on my door
like hey will you please read through my
book I'll send you a copy it took me a
few months and I think it was because I
worked really hard on you know
putting I tried to put a lot of thought
into my reviews it wasn't just like
three sentences like yes I liked this
book go buy it you know I try to talk a
little bit more in depth with my reviews
but also just because I post it
frequently you know you wouldn't see me
post a review and then not for another
three weeks my posting review again I
post several times a day several times a
week so I think people notice that
another big tip I would give if you are
thinking about getting into the book
blogging is don't ignore social media
because that's a big way that people
find me is through my Facebook page
and through my Twitter and you know
using those hashtags hashtags really do
work on Twitter I promise you that
find me really easily through my social
media and then they find my website and
then they find my review policy and
there we go so that's a big thing too is
is don't ignore the social media it can
be super hard to learn I think I got a
Facebook page for chiclet plus right
away but I didn't get Twitter for
probably a year because I thought what
is Twitter no one knows what Twitter is
Twitter's gonna die in like months I'm
not gonna go through putting a Twitter
account and now you can't do anything
without Twitter everyone tweets everyone
everyone tweets so my mom's on Twitter
like gotta get gotta get Twitter so
those are really those are probably the
two social media sites I would really
recommend Facebook and Twitter there's a
lot of other ones we have a Pinterest
page for chiclet plus things like that
but don't ignore your social media
people will really find you that way and
as social media is another huge way that
you're helping promote these authors
because once you build up your followers
and you have a good following and you
and you send a tweet to those followers
or a Facebook post and you say hey I'm
reading this book I'm liking this book
this book's in my mailbox here I
reviewed this book I gave it 5 stars
and you put it out there on your social
media and then other people see it and
other people are interested in your book
and then they're buying it I mean it's
just like a domino effect and so authors
and you know publishing companies and
publicist will see that and then they
will want you so I work with a lot of
the same companies I feel really
that I get to work with both the
traditional publishers and I get to work
with indie publishers I hand they could
work with self-published authors I think
that's so awesome so I check the plus
works with everybody and we really get a
wide array of books that way so those
are the ways that I get books both in
the past when I first started and now
that I'm more established and I hope if
you are thinking about starting a book
blog that this post kind of helped give
you some ideas and inside and how I did
it I I mentioned this in my other
chiclet video which I'll post in the box
below that I'm not very much a tech
person so I did hire someone to make my
website for me because I didn't know how
to do that she's no longer in business
you know if you just google and look
around and you know if you see other
websites that you really like you know
just even dropping them a line or coming
or you know tweeting them send them a
tweet ask them who did their website and
I'm sure people will be able to tell you
who did it for them and you'll be able
to find a connection that way so so
those are my tips and ideas and
suggestions for you and most importantly
how I get my books and I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please
give it a thumbs up and if there's any
other videos that you want to see or you
have questions about about my book blog
about publishing about authors or blog
tours or any other things that you want
to know I would be so happy to make
those videos for you this journey so far
on YouTube has been short but it has
been amazing and thank you so much to
everyone who comments and writes your
emails to me because it's just amazing
it's it's it's overwhelming to try
something new and have such a good
response come from it so I'm very
appreciative and I will wrap this up now
before I just keep talking away so until
next time thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
