today's video is going to be another
like author focused video and it's going
to be all about pitching to book
bloggers kind of like where to find book
bloggers how to contact them just any
like information or tips and tricks that
I have gathered over the years that I
can share with authors so hopefully if
we have some authors out there watching
this video this will be helpful to you I
would love if any authors if you could
comment below with any of your tips and
tricks that maybe I don't cover or if
you're a book blogger please comment
below and give like your top tips and
tricks to so authors can read it so we
can kind of all be in this together I
credentials if you are interested I am a
book bloggers that is how I started
everything I started my blog chocolate
plus back in 2009 and so that's kind of
how I started everything I am now also
an author myself I'm a publisher so I'm
always looking for new book bloggers to
be interested in our books that were
publishing and then I also do a lot of
freelance marketing for authors I also
run CLP block tours which is a blog to
our company so I work with book bloggers
every single day all day i'm always
working with you guys so just over the
years that I've been doing this I've
kind of gotten a few ideas that I can
pass along to authors as well and then i
just i get so many emails and facebook
messages and just questions I mean
literally every single day from authors
saying you know I'm new to this and I'm
not quite sure how to go about it like
do you have any advice you could give me
so I thought making this video could be
a good idea so hopefully if I have some
authors out there you find this one
helpful so if you would like to see my
pitching to bloggers video please keep
watching i want to say that i actually
had planned to film this video tomorrow
so I feel like super unprepared today I
just happen to get up very early this
morning and so I've gotten so much of my
to-do list done that I was just kind of
sitting here this afternoon I was like
should I be doing something right now
and I'm like oh you know I can film we
actually have sunshine outside
so I'm not having to use that annoying
flash on my camera so I was like okay I
feel like everything is in place I
should probably just get this video
filmed but like my hair is like doing
this thing and then I'm cold and I
really don't want to take off my
sweatshirt so I'm going to keep it on
but yeah filming a little bit earlier
than I expected so tonight I had on my
to-do list to like play out the video in
each point that I wanted to hit so I
don't have any notes made for this one
so I just hope I'm not going to be like
all over the place because in my mind I
was kind of already thinking how I could
like detail this video out and then
didn't get to finish all those thoughts
so hopefully this won't be too crazy of
a video it's kind of just the first
thing that I was going to talk about is
how you actually find both bloggers
because I know a lot of authors I mean
especially if you're new but then you're
also new to social media I mean I can
totally understand how overwhelming that
must be to just be like how do I even
find them I find them and then what do I
do next like is it ok to contact the
would say one of the best places to
start is going to be social media and by
that I mean yeah like you can use google
I mean just google book bloggers if you
have a specific genre that you're in
like I work a lot with Chiclets you just
google chick lit book bloggers and see
what pops up you should get a a plethora
of websites to choose from so that's a
really good way to do it but then also
focusing on social media because you can
go to twitter and use a hashtag just
hashtag Chiclets hashtag book bloggers
hashtag book blog because a lot of times
like me when i'm sending out a tweet and
i'm talking about like a book reviewed
on Chiclets plus i'm using the hashtags
book blogger book book blog book
reviewer you know like those sort of
things i'm using those in my tweets
because then that will also make other
people be able to easily find me if they
use that hashtag so you even just
looking at hashtags are a really good
thing but then also like with twitter if
you find like say you use that hashtag
and then you find a blog and you look at
the little info
you know we're a book blogger at Chiklis
calm you know that's that's right
they're usually there should be a link
to their website right in their info bar
as well but then also if you like that
person and you follow them usually on
Twitter it'll pop up like maybe you
should also follow these people and then
usually it gives you that same like it
should give you like three more book
blogs to follow and that's a great way
to just like start the cycle start
finding more and more book bloggers if
you have like Instagram a really good
thing to do another one is of course the
hashtags but if you find a book blog you
can go in and very easily look at who
they follow or who their followers are
and you can very easily go through the
list and just start following people and
just a really good thing to do is just
to be like active what those people talk
to them make comments on them like their
posts try to be engaging on social media
and more an author tip not necessarily
aimed at getting book bloggers but one
thing that I am always recommending to
authors is be a real person on social
media don't just be an author promoting
your book don't send out 30 tweets a day
saying read my book read my book reading
my book be a person talk about your
personal life show pictures of your dogs
or your hamsters or whatever it is that
you want to show like for me I try to
remember because I am an author as well
but I tried to remember to share
pictures of my dogs share pictures of
like my makeup looks because I do beauty
show pictures of my yoga practice you
know I try to do those things and then
every once in a while flip in there and
be like oh hey I also published a book
y'all want to read it like here's a
review that just came in but I try not
to do that super often because people
don't just always want to be sold to
they want to get to know you and I think
especially with how social media is
these days it's really cool because
normal people can feel like we're making
so many connections with people that
were probably never going to meet but i
remember a day that like sophie kinsella
i tweeted me back about i was like
reading her book and then she sent me a
tweet back and I was like incredible
thing and so you know people get to do
that nowadays with authors and even
people are like bigger youtubers we get
excited when
youtubers right back to us or makeup
companies or celebrities or athletes or
whoever it is you know it really does
make your day when someone when you're
able to make that one-on-one connection
with someone so that's a big tip that I
would give to authors as well that's a
great way to find book bloggers is just
social media and then of course I think
another big way is like word of mouth
and that's I mentioned it in i think it
was my writing tips and advice video but
about like joining groups on social
media I belong to a lot of different
like Facebook group not a lot but like I
have three main groups that I really
focus my attentions and we're all
authors and it's just so great we give
each other advice we give each other
support you know we ask opinions in
these groups and other authors can chime
in you know what we think what they
think the butter book cover is you know
things like that um so I think these
groups are really helpful but also
because it's a good way to form
connections with other authors within
those other authors will probably have a
word of mouth like the other day in one
of the groups someone was like hey can
anyone recommend any good chicklet
bloggers and people were trimming in
there and sang different blog names and
I mean that's a really good way of
course as well to to find bloggers and
then another way that I will say is
important is perhaps you know that you
don't want to do this part of your book
marketing like you either don't have
time you don't have the resources or
something but you can always hire out to
find book bloggers and a way to do that
is by hiring you know either like a PR
or marketing person or firm you know
company but also for a blog to our
company and I know I've done a full
video on blog tours what they are why
you should look o most benefits are etc
but I will say it again in this video of
tours are a really good resource for
authors especially new authors that are
just starting out because essentially
you're hiring someone to do that work
for you and usually those blog to our
companies they do charge you a fee but
they are putting together a marketing
package for you and they're using their
resources
will seal people up to us I have a very
large mailing list of book bloggers and
I know what genre say like I know if
they have readers you know and I'm the
one we I have already made a connection
with these book bloggers they know who I
am and they trust me so when I send out
the mailing list you know I have a very
core group of book bloggers that will
sign up for these tours which sometimes
is a little bit easier especially with a
brand new author and you're just cold
calling a book blogger basically you
know they don't know you yet they're not
familiar with their with your work so
it's a it's a little bit easier for a
book blogger to say yes to a blog to our
company then too maybe someone that they
don't know I'm not saying that he will
always get turned down by book bloggers
simply because you're new because that
is not true at all chicklet plus is a
very busy book blog we usually do 122
reviews every single weekday but we are
still constantly saying yes to new
authors all the time I will we will
never turn down someone just because
they're new so that's know what I'm
saying and I'm not trying to scare
anybody here by what I just said but it
just sometimes can be a little bit
easier because we already have a
relationship with the book blogger so
just to make sure i clarify that point
but the blog tour coordinator is finding
the book bloggers but then they're also
doing things like making sure those book
bloggers pick a review date they're
putting together a schedule for you a
lot of times were the ones that are
sending out the ebook files to these
book bloggers making sure they got of
making sure they're reading them sending
them reminders really big thing that I
think was CLP blog tours is that we're
also promoting the books and author on
social media and by that I mean sorry I
keep like fleeing the farmer I keep
fleeing those around sorry I mean by
that is that on the chiclet plus social
media pages which I mean we have a
fairly decent following I think we're
getting close to six thousand on
facebook and we're probably at close to
six thousand on Twitter as well we've
just recently started the Instagram page
which is getting close to 2000 and then
of course here on YouTube a lot of times
I'm mentioning the books that I have
hauled and reviewed and a lot of those
are for CLP blog tours but
chicklet plus is also talking about the
books that are going on tour and we're
doing a lot of marketing that way and so
you know we have a larger following them
also perhaps an author who is just
starting out and just getting their
social media accounts rolling so that
can be a good way to also get your book
out there but then be able to find new
followers as well so even though it does
cost money you know and packages very
blog to her company's very I mean I've
seen blog tours as cheap as ten dollars
I've seen blog tours as expensive as a
thousand dollars like I mean there's
just going to be a range in there each
company is different what we do is
different we have different you know
followings we have different quarter
genres that we work with etc so you to
kind of have to do the work to see which
blog to our company is going to be the
best fit for you but there are so many
out there these days like new ones are
popping up all of the time so there is
you know always someone that you should
be able to find that will meet your best
needs but that can be a really good way
to find book bloggers especially because
the blog tour company should then give
you you know you're going to kno who
reviewed for you this first time and
you're going to have their names and you
probably should have their emails but
you'll at least have their their blog
URLs and that sort of thing so then when
you write your second book you will
already have that information so there's
a core group of bloggers that now you
can contact and you can say hey thank
you for participating in my tour you
know last year or whatever it was I'm so
excited I have the follow-up book ready
to go do you want me to send you a copy
etc so you're already starting to build
up your list and you were able to do it
easily with a blog tour company doing
the legwork for a few ideas on how you
can find your book bloggers and then
sometimes I I see authors wondering why
they need book bloggers and I I kind of
questioned whether I was going to
include this part in the video as well
because I guess to me and you know it's
probably because i've just been around
for so long but and then i also am a
blogger that I'm like hey we're super
important how does every will not know
that at that I see being asked so I'm
like you know I will mention it just
real quick feel like book bloggers are
very important to authors are the
biggest things that you
you want to get for your book is book
reviews and book bloggers are a
fantastic way to go about that a lot of
book bloggers understand that it's
important not only to put their reviews
on their blogs and then also promote it
on social media effectively promoting
you and your book a lot of times we will
tag the authors that we are reviewing
for promoting on our blogs will tag you
because we want you to repost it too
because we want traffic to our websites
you know we're all working together in
this I get your reviews on amazon and
goodreads as well because you want one
other people visit your book pages you
want to have your reviews coming you
want to look like people have been
reading your books they've been liking
it they want to leave you know hopefully
positive reviews and that sort of thing
so book bloggers are very aware that
authors want reviews on Amazon goodreads
you know barnes &amp;amp; noble etc so book
bloggers are a great way to be able to
build up your reviews for that again
book bloggers like I said are important
for the social media because you know I
I don't think it's very common to have a
book blog and to not have some sort of
for have some form of social media tied
along with it we're probably going to
have facebook or twitter or instagram
you know it's such a we're going to have
these pages like which I clip+ has a
Pinterest page I post everything that we
put on chocolate plus it gets pinned or
our pinterest page and people can find
these pins and repin them and see the
reviews that were saying so but bloggers
are probably going to have social media
that we're going to be promoting our
reviews and posts on so it's a really
good way to get more social media
exposure as well that is why I think
book bloggers are important they're
definitely I mean they just they
definitely need to be a part of your
marketing plan when you are publishing a
book or you're getting your marketing
plan together as your book is being like
proof read or the covers designer or
whatever and you're doing your marketing
plan I mean do not forget both bloggers
I feel like this is really obvious and
what I'm saying but don't forget about
them because they are going to be a big
part of your marketing plan so I don't
know what it is today but like I am so
uncomfortable like my legs hurt so bad
and I keep I mean obviously you can't
see me but like I keep stretching out my
I like I'm sitting cross-legged and then
I'm getting up and then I'm sitting on
my legs and then I'm getting up and then
I'm trying to stretch my legs out in all
these directions I don't know what it is
but they are just killing me today so
anyways you guys probably don't care
about what my legs are doing but then to
actually get into how to pitch to book
bloggers okay so we've covered why
bloggers are important how they can be
an asset to your marketing plan and how
to find these book bloggers weather on
your own are paying someone someone else
to do it for you but if you are going to
do it yourself you've decided you're
going to find you know these book
bloggers you find them what one of my
biggest suggestions right away is to
keep like a spreadsheet of who you
contact because nothing is worse than
not keeping any notes and then finding a
blog and being like did I already
contact that blog I don't remember you
know of course you want to make notes on
if someone said yes and you know what
review date they said that they're going
to post also really handy because then
if you're going to use this list again
for your next book you'll have
information and they're like what format
did they take to they take a kindle or
an ePub you know things like that so my
biggest suggestion definitely is
organization keep that list so you know
keep it handy because then you'll have
those email addresses in there you'll
have items like you know whatever items
that you think is important to you their
blog URL definitely I've seen authors
put in there their notes like little
things about the book bloggers so that
when you go to contact them again like
you almost have something to talk about
and I think that's a really good idea
and this is something that I learned
back in business school because I used
to manage a business and for each client
that we had we we would keep a file
client for them but one thing that I
would do is I would write something down
like when they came in for a visit and I
talked to them and they said oh I'm
going on a cruise in January they would
leave I would go on their files i had a
cruise in january and then when they
came back six months later I could be
like hey how was your cruise in January
and they're like oh how did you remember
that's like well obviously keeping notes
on you but I think that's a really cool
thing to do
and I feel like more and more people are
doing that these days because I get
those emails a lot they're like hey
how's your dog or you got married how
was your wedding you know things like
that but I think that's a really cool
idea to so I mean that's just that's not
a must but I think it's kind of
something that could that set you apart
from others possibly i think that
organization is key but then also
putting together your media kit i think
is really important really up to you
what you what you want to put in your
media kit but definitely things to go in
there is the blurb for your story the
cover your bio your photo if you have an
author headshot I really recommend
getting one it just it just is something
so nice about being able to put a face
to a name honestly and so your headshot
if you have one if you have your social
media links your website links I
definitely suggest including those in
there your book is already out or it's
on pre-order or on Goodreads or
something like that and you have any
book links that you can put in your
media kit I definitely suggest that I
know sometimes you should definitely be
contacting book bloggers you know even
prior before publication so sometimes
you won't always have those links
because the book is not for sale on the
Amazon or goodreads but one thing that i
really suggest is once you have your
cover ready to go you know maybe you're
doing a big cover revealed your cover is
ready and out there definitely get that
book up on Goodreads because that's not
a selling site so you don't have to
worry about you know having the final
book ready to go or anything like that
but it's really nice to be able to have
at least some link so people can see
your book page the cover and things like
that and then also if you send out
review copies early if you send out
advanced reading copies then people can
already start posting their reviews on
there even though it might not be up on
amazon or barnes and noble yet I also
feel like I'm like running out of breath
because of what I'm talking about things
I'm really passionate about I talked
really fast and I'm like remember to
bring Samantha remember to breathe so
those are all you know really important
things to include in your media kit and
then what I do is that I just save it as
a file on my computer on your desktop
whatever it is that you need to be so
you save it so it's ready usually right
sort of like opening blurb on there and
this is something that can get changed
frequently from blogger to blogger
because you know if this isn't your
first book maybe you're saying hi thank
you for reading my book last year now I
have a new book out and was wondering if
you might be interested in it or it
might say something like hi I'm a new
author my genre that I right in his
chiclets and I've noticed your book blog
as Chiclets plus I thought this might be
a good fit for you like you want to have
some sort of introduction paragraph
instead of just sending a media kit out
to people don't do that don't do that
you want to introduce yourself and you
want to ask for what you want you want
to say you know hey I'm looking for book
reviews can I send you a review copy or
if you're too busy for reviews right now
I can do an interview and send you an
excerpt from the book you want to have
some sort of introduction paragraph
definitely even if it's a blogger that
you've already worked with you you want
to have that paragraph in there saying
who you are what you're looking for what
your book is but then you want to
include the media kit in there with you
and this will be nice because you'll
already have it all ready to go on your
computer you can just copy and paste
attach the files and boom you're done so
instead of every time you're sending a
new email here like oh shoot where's my
blurb okay now I need to grab my cover
from over here and oh I yup here are my
links like you'll just have everything
ready to go it'll be a big time-saver
for you and it's just super handy to
have that ready to go when you're
sending out your emails one of the
biggest things that I will suggest is to
send individual emails versus sending
like 10 or you know 20 or whatever at a
time and just either like ccing or bc
seeing people i will say if you do
decide to ignore this piece of advice
and you want to group message several
people at a time do it in bcc and not CC
because people are not going to like to
see all their email addresses if you
only see see people that's really
annoying it happens to me a lot and I'm
like haha please don't do that really
recommend doing individualized emails so
you can say hi Samantha and mentioned
name or my blog Chiclets plus i get so
many emails where i've started sharing
them more on social media where i got
one the other day and it said dear and
then in front these in parentheses it
said put bloggers name here or name a
book blog if you can't find their name
and then went into the email and i was
just like Oh Nelly but I get one's a lot
that are like dear blogger or just hey
and it's like okay it's kind of silly
but it might seem like a silly thing but
every book blog that you find should
have a review policy on there there
should be a name of someone somewhere on
there sometimes people it is hard to
find individual names and I I totally
get that because I've seen it before but
then you can put like Hello Chiclets
plus or hide chocolate plus team like
you know something like that because
just the form emails I mean those don't
look very well so I mean that's just one
a really big piece of advice is to
individualize your emails and it might
seem like it's going to be a lot more
time-consuming than group messaging
people but I think you will get a better
response then if you were to go that
route but again that's why it's really
good to have your media kit ready and to
have your paragraph written and even
though you might need to you know adjust
a few words here and there you can write
you can have that same paragraph with
like the first sentence or two changed
just have that one ready to go to so you
can just copy and paste which ever email
it is that you need and have it ready to
go in that email so it doesn't take too
much time the other thing that I will
definitely recommend is to read the
review policies for the book bloggers
especially if they are new to you read
the review policies because sometimes
the policies will say like hey we're
closed for reviews right now it's it's
close to the holidays or you know how we
need to add more people to our review
team we're just out too far we're not
doing reviews because then if you send a
review request and you're like hey I see
it on your blog that you know you like
Chiclets how about reading my book and
then it's like well yeah but our
he says that were not open for reviews
right now it's kind of silly and I mean
book blockers are in super high demand I
know this I know this from being a book
blogger i know from being an author i
know from being a blog tour coordinator
but letters are in high demand usually a
lot of book blogs that i see book
probably two to three months out like if
you were to ask right now for a review
on Chiclets plus we are out right now
until january and that's like really
pushing it we're trying to get to out
every single day i need to be mindful of
that and again check the review policy
because it should be in there hate it
can take us up to three months to review
the book or we're just out so far we
can't review books until six months so
in the review policy they should say
like do they take ebooks or do they only
take print books I i dunno some book
bloggers that will only take print books
they still you know they don't want to
ereader or whatever they don't want to
read e-books they only take print books
and some authors I mean I'm one of them
I just don't send out print copies
anymore it just isn't it just isn't
smart for me to not only buy a book but
then ship a book because sometimes
people say they will review a book and I
don't review a book and then you just
spend twenty dollars to send someone a
book and you don't have anything to show
for it a lot easier for us to send you
books but some people don't take ebooks
some people will only take certain
genres so you want to make sure that
your genre is going to fit into that
blog bugs will have different items that
they want sent to them like some book
bloggers I've seen have to like they
require the Goodreads like to be in your
review request some requests a certain
subject heading line like it has to say
review request title and author der
you're reading not review policy so that
you know you're you're giving them the
information that they need because I
mean I know book bloggers that they
require you to send you know ABCD but if
you only send ABC they just delete the
email they don't even bother getting
back to you because you didn't read the
review policy that they work so hard on
putting up on there
side so they're just not even going to
respond to your email I do know people
like that like I said book bloggers are
so busy I mean I don't even know how
many review requests we get a day for
trick lo + but I mean it's multiple
multiple review requests we get a day
and so sometimes it is hard to respond
to everyone especially if someone hasn't
even bothered to take the time to know
your name or your blog name and they're
just like blindly emailing you like hi
bloggers I want to review my book or I
feel like nothing kind of drives me
crazy ER than when literally someone
doesn't even say hi hello my name is
this is my book they literally just copy
and paste that media kit into an email
and send it off to you I'm like what do
you want do you want to review do you
want to feature do you want what do you
want and so I mean I do I just I'll
delete that email because I seriously I
don't know what you want so why am I
going to have to take my time to respond
back to you to be like what are you
asking for so I would say definitely
read that review policy and make sure
before you email them that you have all
your ducks in a row and you know what
you're wanting to say but then again a
big thing like I've been saying is to
make sure to ask for what it is you're
looking for are you looking for early
reviews because if you want early
reviews you want to make sure that you
say your publication date that's
something that that is really good to
include in your media kit if you're
sending out books prior to publication
you'll want to let people know like hey
I'm emailing you in November but my book
is going to come out on January 12 I'm
looking for reviews to run during review
week because that way people will know
they can look at their schedule they can
gauge the reading list you're not
looking for reviews maybe you just want
both bloggers to be able to post on
their blog that your book come has come
out so you want them to be a part of
your release week blitz you want people
to be able to say on their blogs hey
this is a new release you want them to
put in on their social media this is a
new release and you can say you know if
you want to i have review copies
available but really you know i just
want you to for the release week so that
way they know what you're asking for
maybe you're only looking for for
interviews for yourself at
I make sure you say it in your email ham
looking for interviews to run on this
time frame including that time frame is
so important because I right back I I
mean this happens every single day that
I write back to an email and I'm like
what time frame are you looking for
because again our schedules get full so
fast that if you just email me and
you're like I'm looking for a review my
first question is when because I need to
look at our calendar I need to look at
all our reviewer schedules so make sure
you're asking for what it is you're
looking for and what time right time
frame you're looking for if you are
looking for reviews make sure to let
people know what review formats you have
because not everyone has a kindle some
authors will only publish on kindle
which which is totally fine and you know
amazon has their their program KDP
select that you can only publish you can
only have your book for sale on kindle
and some authors will just do that
they'll just make a mobi file and that's
all I just want a good get on Amazon and
that's fine but not everyone has a
kindle so if you only have kindle copies
and then you ask a book bloggers to
review and they say yes and you send up
my Kindle copy and I write back and
they're like well I have an iPad or I
have a kobo like I can't read this then
you're like oh okay so make sure if
you're asking for a review that you're
saying what formats you have if you are
going to send out print copies you know
be sure to mention that but make sure to
also list if you have any shipping
restrictions like yes I have print
copies that I'll send a book bloggers
but only bloggers and you know this
country this country this country for me
I'm in the US and it's really hard for
me to ship to like Australia it takes a
lot of money it takes a lot of times and
sometimes the books just don't show up
so you've paid money to buy your own
book ship your book then you've paid
extra shipping to get it to Australia
and then it gets lost somewhere over the
ocean and your book is gone so make sure
you also include that as well and then
another just really big tip I have for
when you are sending out these pitch
emails is to not include your book in
your
pitch email a lot of times I know a lot
of book bloggers they say it right there
on the review policy like if you just
send me a copy of the book without me
agreeing to review i'll just delete your
email I mean everyone has their own
preferences and their own their own
thing kind of silly to me to just be
going ahead I mean this is to me as an
author it's silly to me to just be
sending my book out to people without
them like saying yes or agreeing to
review it like I don't know something
about it just kind of like weirds me out
and I wouldn't want to be sending my
work just blindly out to people without
you know like know what I don't know it
just I don't know it's weird to me um to
me on the book blogger side of it I'm
not super like don't send me your book
because I won't even consider it me more
on the other side that that doesn't like
it but I see a lot of book letters that
say you know if you send that book to me
without without em you know me agreeing
to review that they won't even look at
your email so that's something really
big just because I've seen it on so many
different blogs but I just want to make
sure to to mention it and one last quick
thing before I wrap this up is I get
asked a lot how to make the files to
send to the book bloggers like how do
you send a mobi file for the kindle how
do you send an ePub for a Kobo what I do
and how how I do it is we have our
marching ink books are professionally
formatted not only for a paperback copy
but they're professionally formatted for
Erie ders we we use pole Gary asst
formatting I believe is how you say it
their company in Australia we've used
them for the last several marching ink
books and I really like them I can leave
a link to them below if you're an author
and you have a formatting company that
you really enjoy please do leave it in
the comments so others can see it as
well but basically I pay them and they
give me a PDF file that goes for my
paper back and they give me a mobi which
is compatible with Kindles and an epub
which is compatible for like cobos and
iPads I believe like Apple products I
believe uses the epubs these are the
files that I
blow dry to Amazon to make my Kindle
copy and I upload the epubs directly to
like Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and Kobo but then
these are also the files that I send out
to the book bloggers now I know that
there's probably the formatting
companies are not companies but like
formatting websites that you can use
like when I create my advanced reading
copies I format I i convert them myself
I won't say a format them because i
don't i literally just Google to convert
a word doc to a PDF file and then I
upload it and then download the PDF file
it gives me because I don't do any
formatting I do I don't do any HTML
coding I don't make a table of contents
so people can easily like if I'm reading
on my Kindle and I somehow get to my
home screen and I want to get back to
chapter 5 I can just go right to the
table of contents cliff chapter 5 and
boom it takes me there I don't do that
for my advanced reading copies because
they're an AR see they still need to be
proof read you I truly don't recommend
trying to do it yourself unless you know
what you are doing but like me I have no
idea how to format a book I recommend
getting it professionally format it
because it is frustrating to read a
kindle and you can tell that the book
has not been formatted like the text is
wonky there's like weird section breaks
here and there like that is frustrating
unless I know I'm reading an AR see then
obviously I don't mind but if i buy a
book on amazon and it turns out like
that and there's no table of contents
that is a really huge thing i believe
it's still a thing where if you buy a
book on amazon and there's no table of
contents you can return it because you
have to have that table of contents that
though is how it was before because i
actually had like i was notified by
amazon like hey your book doesn't have
table of contents you need it I was like
wait what that was a long time ago when
i first started publishing really do
suggest getting it professionally
formatted because then you'll have your
files ready to go for when you actually
publish your book but then you'll also
have them for when you're sending them
to book bloggers you should have your
mobiie and your epub I mean I do have a
PDF and some people do ask for pdfs but
I'm I I don't prefer to send PDF first
please don't ever send a word doc hey
that because
I get requests and you know I'll say yes
and I'll say you know yeah I can read a
kindle copy and they're like well I
don't have a kindle copy but I can send
you a doc file I'm like no don't send me
your doc file hi no no no wanna say it
just because I've seen it before but
yeah definitely I think finding a good
formatting company so you can have those
files easily accessible would be the way
to do it i dot mobi or a dot PRC is what
is compatible for kindles and yeah the
epub is what is compatible with the
cobos and like Apple products as well ok
so I'm trying to think if there's
anything else that I can say for this
video I'm like I'm starting to lose my
voice it's starting to like cut out of
me as I'm talking so I know that we're
talking for a really long time other
questions please do leave in the
comments below and I will be really
happy to to answer them I really wanted
this video to be focused on how to pitch
to book bloggers you know how to find
them why they're important what to
include in your email like little little
tips like making sure you read the
review policy and address them by name
making sure you create your spreadsheets
and your list that you have that on hand
creating your media kit log to our
companies that will do this all for you
you know I'm trying to think if I've
missed anything but I mean I'm sure I
have because it's especially without
making notes it's so hard to be sure i'm
hitting everything but again please do
comment below let me know if I've missed
anything find me on Twitter rooms I'm
super happy to answer any questions yeah
I think that's all i can think of to say
