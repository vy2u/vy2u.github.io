anybody see me I will wait for some
comments to come in hopefully um hi guys
I'm doing another livestream I'm going
to be doing a PR haul I did ask recently
on my Twitter what you guys would want
to see in the next livestream and the
most votes were for a PR haul so I have
I have a lot of stuff to go through so I
am excited for it hi okay yay so I'm
here people can see me excellent
um hopefully my setup is a little bit
better this time it's so funny when I
went live last week it is so different
being like filming on your phone versus
the camera because there were so many
times where I thought I was so so close
to the camera hiring me I thought I was
so close to the camera there is just ran
into my tripod and I kept like backing
away I was like why does I like why do I
look so close and then in the playback I
realized I was super far away and at one
point like I thought you couldn't see
the quote on my wall so I even said like
oh you probably can't see it in the
playback it's so clear like it's just
it's a totally different aspect but I
try to act like I'm filming a regular
video with my regular tripod I just have
my mini tripod on top of it so hopefully
we look a little bit better today but
yeah hi everybody
oh thank you Tara I used the new Jaclyn
hill and morphe palette on my eyes today
hey April okay so I do have a lot to get
through we'll see if we can get through
everything I'm not sure if we will be
able to but it is Tuesday so I have to
go to buy my um volleyball late tonight
thank you Amy I did hit 20,000
subscribers that is like that's a very
surreal feeling that's pretty cool also
sorry if I am tilted because my mini
tripod we found me on snap you know I've
been having all sorts of troubles with
it today and it's like it's still high
Daniel I can't like twist anything on it
um tightly so my camera is kind of like
or my phone is like wobbling back and
forth so super super interesting
okay so first up I want to show
you guys this because I was so excited
for it hi Angelina this is a watch from
your watches so they reached out and
asked if they could send me a watch and
they have like wood watches thanks
Kaylee that you love my make up lots of
love from Alabama hi Michelle that's
where my family lives cool um so they
asked if they could send me a wood watch
and I was so excited about that because
I love watches and I don't have a lot
because they can usually be pretty
pricey hi Katie I'm so glad you could
make it and so when they asked if they
could send me a wood watch I got so
excited my husband got so jealous he was
like what because he loves wood his
wedding ring actually has like wood
inside of it I don't know if that's how
I'm saying it correctly but I don't know
he just like woodworking and all that
kind of stuff so he was like super
jealous of it so when I got it it looked
like this am I too close I like I feel
like I'm I feel like I'm super close
hold on I'm gonna back up like a little
bit and I know I was just saying last
week's video I thought I was too close
and I was really not but I just feel
like I look really close so this is what
the watch looks like isn't that so cool
hi Michelle yay okay so again this is
from yard watches I looked up the
pronunciation just to be sure because it
spelled like George but it's pronounced
yard and I saw like the guy that I've
been talking to Ben he's out of st.
Louis I was like well that is not far
from me in Iowa so kg says I don't want
to close okay alrighty then it's so
weird because I feel like I just look
totally different from how I see now
from what the actual playback playback
looks like so this is the yard watch it
came with some paperwork
it came with like an oil we were reading
the paperwork last night's like just got
it last night and you need to put like
the oil on before you even like wear it
so I do still need to do that but I want
to see what this looks like ooh okay I
don't have it like clasp yet but ooh
that's a fun I don't have anything like
this so that is super cool um he did
that me know this this isn't like a
sponsored video or anything like that
but this is a PR also all this was sent
to me and Ben did let me know so cool
it's really well - I like that he did
let me know that I could do a giveaway
with him which I was so excited about so
we're going to be doing a giveaway for
180 dollars in store credit to the your
watches and I want the best way to show
it there we go so once the live part is
over and I can actually fill out the
description box I'll have a link in
there for the giveaway to win the 180
and then he also gave me a discount code
for 25 dollars off any watch plus a free
engraving which I thought was pretty
cool so again once this uploads after
I'm done going live I'll have all the
information in the description box but
that is really really cool
hmm I guess I'd I just love watches if
you're into watches or like into what or
anything I don't know I feel like you
could really like himself once it goes
live I'll have all of those links down
below and the links to the website in
general but it also came in this really
sweet box Katie said tell your husband
enter to win he asked him I picked the
winner he's like we pick me I'm like
well that would look a little suspicious
right but I was like um no Ben said that
they picked the winner like their system
um picks the winner with say Michelle so
she collects watches yes I know I feel
like I do too I have a lot of them I
always ask her watches and one of my
first um publishing presents to myself
when I published it was even my first or
second book I bought a coach watch I
thought it was pretty cool thought I was
pretty cool I still have it it's white I
thought it was pretty so when I film I
don't have you know how most people
Philmont like their vanity or a table or
something I don't have that I just sit
on a barstool and that's all I do so I
actually brought out another barstool to
put items on here and then I have the
rest on my desk so it's gonna be kind of
annoying especially if you're watching
in the playback because I'm going to be
like going all over the place but that's
really just that's the best I could do
I'm sorry okay I got a lot of tanning
items which is awesome because if you
follow me on snapchat
last week trying out one of the Tarte
Tanner's then it was so funny because
that same day I got um a tanning package
in the mail and then like two days later
I got another one so this package is
from Vita Liberata luxury tan
and this was sent to me for preemie
which is like an influencer community
kind of like influencer so you get
chosen to be in campaigns and then you
get some sent to something to review it
so it's not necessarily like PR in the
traditional sense because it is you know
I had to like apply and be selected for
the campaign and things like that
and then I do have a certain number of
days that I do have to review but it's
kind of the same concept and I thought I
could show it so I'm super excited about
this because I hear a lot about this at
Vita Liberata so they have like a little
pamphlet in here but I also just saw
Carli bybel talking about this on her
one of her more recent videos where she
wore like the rainbow shirt and I was
like wait I just got that so I haven't
tried it out yet because I'm waiting to
do it on camera too so they have the 10
minute tan which says rinse after 10
minutes which is pretty interesting as
for face and body and it came with some
tanning mitts
too and then also this body blur which
I'm super curious about it says instant
HD skin finished 24-hour wear so I think
this is what Carly put on her um arms in
her snapchat and really did like it gave
her a tam but it also like blurred
things out - grease oh my gosh hi
that is so cool I'm so those were in
there and then also this self tanning
bronzing minerals I think this is like a
face powder I think I just saw these pop
up on Sephora so that is pretty cool so
I'm excited to try all of these out
because I have been searching for that
like one like self tanner that I really
really want I'm Jen said what shadow are
you wearing it is from the new jaclyn
hill and morphe palette it is pool party
in the middle of my lids and I think
it's Jada is the green on the rest of my
lid so yeah I filmed a tutorial it'll be
up on Instagram probably tomorrow other
side could you please do a review on
these products on these tanning ones
because yes get this yes I sure can
I'm excited to use them especially that
body blur so then I got another tanning
package which is so funny so this is
from San Tropez has anybody tried either
of these you don't let a brought Vita
Liberata is the JH palette worth the
hype I do have a full review video on it
if anyone is interested again when this
gets done uploading like a regular video
I can leave it linked down below but
it's one or more may more one of my more
recent videos I think I uploaded on
Sunday I do have a full review and like
swatches and everything like that so
hopefully it'll help you make an opinion
if you want to get it Cano goes on sale
tomorrow ok these I'm super curious
about I've been seeing people use them
from San Tropez it's their bronzing face
sheet mask five minutes will give you a
light tan at ten minutes a medium tan
and 15 minutes a dark tan Li that is
kind of that was kind of crazy they sent
to you know I love sheet masks and I
love bronzing it says a nourishing and
glowing tanning face mask whew okay I'll
give a try I'll give it a try and then
this is an advanced one hour tan
bronzing mist again one hour light two
hours medium three hours of for dark
will you try the sheet mass handing one
on camera I could try I can't right now
cuz I have makeup on and I have to why I
have to go to volleyball after this but
I typically show up to volleyball like
this people a lot I feel like are very
curious about why I should go up like
this but it's because I'm usually
filming every single day but I'm excited
to try this to it so this just a
bronzing mist so it didn't come with
like a like I met or anything but I
guess you just spray it on you and you
see what happens so these are from San
Tropez I'm very excited bronzing mist
sheet masks okay very cool so I will be
trying those out as well okay
I'm wearing a teal I like yeah that's
awesome
I know amber you didn't get notified
when I went live I don't think I ever
get notified when anybody goes live
people that I'm subscribed to that I put
the bell for I never get know
in someone's life I don't get notified
when people post videos like maybe once
a week I'll get an email saying like oh
all of these people post a video within
the past week it's like cool how is that
helpful to me like I'm hitting the bells
for everybody I never get notified I
don't know I don't know where these
things are going but I'm not getting
them okay I have a few things from
actally that I can share octoly is for
oh god some of you guys to get the
notification yes okay that's good that's
good um Michelle said I'm gonna put it
in my phone are you gonna chat at the
same time every week I would like to owe
my highlights popping thank you it's C
Oh lost it what I lied am I wearing oh
it's from V new um Becca and Chrissy
Teigen yes I got that palette one of my
lovely subscribers red said it to be I'm
just so frigging oh so cool um but I do
want is so hard going live because you
get so distracted my like thoughts are
everywhere but I would like to go
Tuesday at 4:00 CST I picked Tuesday
because I regularly upload Monday
Wednesdays and Thursdays Fridays are
usually my vlogs um some ones that I got
notified but it's been like 45 minutes
already mine only says 12 minutes 12
minutes
amber is that the morphe Jackson Helen
your eyes yes so I would like to choose
Tuesday's it's just a little hard for me
because I have to go to volleyball so I
know people said they wanted evenings
but this is going to be like the latest
that I can go so let me know if a
different day or time or time frame
works for you because I can kind of just
like test out a bunch of different ones
and see how we do
so hey Randy um so these are from
actually which again is for bloggers and
brands to connect and basically you have
to go on and you'll see something in
your free store and you can apply for
you don't get accepted every time I
really don't get accepted every time but
you have to say like where you'll talk
about it and where you will review it in
that sort of thing it's a really cool
concept if anybody is a blogger they do
have certain requirements like follower
counts and things like that they change
them often so I'm not sure what they are
right now but I'll leave it link down
below I would get like a
I'll point if you used my referral so
there's that if you don't want to use
that just look up oculi so this is from
Lancome I am super excited to talk about
this I just reviewed it on my Instagram
this is their mat shaker and I have the
shade yummy pink this is like insane so
I tried out their juicy shakers which i
thought was nice because it was kind of
like a lip oil and I mean I didn't wear
it as like a going-out lipstick or
anything it was just kind of like
hydrating on my lips and I liked it but
this is an actual like lipstick type of
lip color I don't know what I'm trying
to say here because it doesn't feel like
a lipstick it doesn't feel like a lip
gloss it doesn't feel like I mean it
feels like nothing that I've ever ever
tried but it is so pigmented if you
follow me on Instagram I just posted it
yesterday I'm marched Beauty word it is
vibrant and bright with just one swipe
on the bottom and one swipe on the top
lip it's a I am in your face and so
long-lasting like sickening long-lasting
it is crazy so the Lancome matte shakers
I would totally recommend they are I
really like blew my mind
Katie said I bought one of the matte
shakers I haven't wanted but I want it
you should let me know what you think oh
can I swatch yeah um sorry yeah keep me
on track here if I need to like swatch
anything or do anything because I
remembered to bring out wipes I brought
out scissors okay so I opened it a
little bit and then I'm shaking it and
then this is what it looks like so it's
the same like applicator as the juicy
shakers and then there is a swash of the
yummy pink and you guys can you see how
it looks like it almost has like a sheen
to it but when you actually like when
you actually do apply it to your lips
it's so pigmented and very opaque it's
like insane um but it also like feels
comfortable at the same time it's like
the weirdest thing I've never I've
seriously never tried anything like this
so cool um I thought I had oh yeah so
another thing that I got from Pierre
which makes me so excited because I love
Pierre so this is the
I don't know why I put things back in
the packaging like it matters that I
show you guys the packaging this is the
pot but this is their make it matte oil
mattifying blotting stick now I have
only tried it out a couple times here's
what it looks like
the JH palette goes on sale at 8 a.m.
PST yes tomorrow 8a PST
some people asked me if there was a
limit per customer I think it's 3 per
customer is what I am reading so this is
what it looks like so you can just pop
this on anywhere where you get like oily
and it'll make it matte I've only used
this a couple times over the weekend
when I was out and about but it really
does work it's really awesome
I wanted this because I'm not a really
oily person but sometimes in the summer
like oils can like peek through and I
thought this would be really good
instead of always having to bring like a
powder with you you can like this guys
like small you just pop it in your
little clutch that's what I did so I
really I feel like I'm gonna really like
this guy I want to give it a few more
tries before I do like my full review on
it but so far we're looking pretty good
I did order the Nikki heat today it's on
sale today at Sephora online and it'll
be tomorrow at Ulta online I think
they're only like one day things but if
you haven't gotten from Sephora today it
is two times points on purchases and
also eight percent cash back on eBay
that's what I did that's the first thing
I did this morning so my review video
will be coming soon okay so this is
another guy from octoly it is from Kenzo
world and it's one of their perfumes if
you guys follow me on snap again you
know that I loved the first perfume that
I tried from them like the flower
perfume oops so good and so when I saw
this one I really wanted to get it this
one I did want to save the box because I
just thought the box looked so cool but
also the packaging is like sick like oh
how cool is that
I know though so awesome I don't like
this scent as much as I love the flower
one from Kenzo it's just a little bit
stronger but it's not like to because I
don't I don't like really like overpower
overpowering perfumes but this is a
really nice scent and seriously this
packaging is so oh so cool so I got that
one too and then the last thing that I
got from actally is nail polish and if
you guys know me you know I love nail
polish so I get my nails done at a salon
I go and get them filled but then I
paint them myself I think I'm like super
duper weird um but I'm always like no
I'm just a fill I'll paint them at home
because I have so much nail polish
because I love nail polish and I love to
change my shades and OPI had this on
here I actually thought that you were
just getting one polish because I've got
OPI polishes before from actally and you
just get a pick shade and so that's what
I thought I got and to my surprise I got
all these new polishes I was like um
wait what are you kidding me this is
amazing so I've been trying out quite a
few right now on my fingernails I have
take me to Napa or time for a Napa time
for a Napa because this is their
California dreamin collection so all of
the shades are like funny California and
type names like what's that one
Malibu peer pressure excuse me Big Sur I
wore this in my friend's wedding I think
I have me myself E and I that's on my
toenails gave myself a pedicure the
other day yeah this is the one I have on
my nails time for a NAPA
OPI is like some of my favorite nail
polishes I have a sticking amount of
them I thought that was so cool when all
of these came up I was like no way um it
says I have poor connection so I don't
know how how we're doing or if anybody
can see me but I'm still here
I don't know why I have poor connection
I'm sorry um so let's keep moving on um
I got the Instagram bra like that sticky
bra does anybody want me to UM do a
video on it and test it out let me know
but I got it so there's that this one
to me in PR so I don't know let me know
if you want me to do full video on it
I still trained it out they send me to
different sizes and the first one I
think was too small so now I need to try
the bigger guy and see how I like it so
let me know if you guys want to see a
full review video on that or if you've
seen too many of them just just let me
know ok so this was really cool this is
a highlighter and it's like please do a
video on the sticker bro okay again it
might be weird but you know that's fine
we can still do it but this is like one
of those like flour highlighters it kind
of reminded me of those re ok I'm
reading the comments it um this kind of
reminded me of the lancome rose
highlighters so it is from I sent a nice
note so let me make sure I get this all
correct so this is from la la la Lu
cosmetics la la Lu cosmetics calm they
said we're offering a 15% off code when

bad at shaving my legs I don't know if

still terrible at it still terrible at
it but I'm going to try the shave gel
just to see I hate shaving my legs yes

never have so scary to me but I was
super excited to get this because it's
from ELF

recently and it just to this day I mean
it just blows my mind like elf cosmetics

purchased from elf cosmetics is $1 at
Target one dot and I bought it and I was
so excited for it and to get a box of
them like glitter every time I open my
mailbox and I see something from them

as crazy to me so here is the what the
inside of the box looks like let's see
