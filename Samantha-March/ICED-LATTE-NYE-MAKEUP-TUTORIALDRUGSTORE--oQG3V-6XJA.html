to be doing a new years eve makeup
tutorial and it is on this look right

something along the lines of like a
frosted or i see look and i don't know i
just really like the way it came out i
did use almost all drugstore products in
this tutorial almost all of them there

but i will get into them as i'm in the
video if you guys can see that i have
this beautiful piece of jewelry on I
have some exciting news that a company
called marina collections reached out to
me and asked if I would like to be an

I decided to go ahead and do it and I
was sent this piece this is called The

got it the day after Christmas and I
thought this is so perfect for New

cone I thank you so much you are just
helping me buy more makeup and jewelry
so thank you but yes if you guys would
like to see how I got this new years eve
makeup look please keep my first thing
I'm doing is priming my eyes with the
benefit Air Patrol I primer I just got a
sample of this so I'm trying to use it
up so that's why i am using this one and
so far i really really like it i like
that at color crooks too i think that's
really awesome next I'm going in with
the Rimmel stay matte powder and my ELF
small tapered brush and I'm just padding
that over the primer so my eye is not
tacky then coming in with the NYX jumbo
pencil in milk and I'm just going to put
that all over my eyelid and that's going
to be a base for the eyeshadows that I
put on and I'm not being very precise at
all I'm just kind of placing it on there
and then I'll take my finger and kind of
smooth it all out
next I'm coming in with the Loreal
infallible eyeshadows and I'm sorry that
clip went so fast you couldn't see the
name but it is oh no I can't remember
what it is and I don't have it by me
i'll link it below but it's like my
favorite color and I'm coming in with a
BH Cosmetics brush and this is just kind
of like a it's got a point at the end
and I'm placing that like in the outer V
and then blending it into my crease but
mostly just focusing it on the outer V
of my eye and leaving the inner part of
my eyelid alone for now
and then coming in with another l'oreal
infallible shadow this is in iced latte
and I'm taking a large flat shader brush
from BH Cosmetics and I'm placing that
in inner part of my eye and towards the
middle of my eyelid kind of blending it
starting to blend it in with the police
you
and I'm going to take them on my mac
fix+ and I'm going to spray that same
brush and come back in with the iced
latte color and it just helps bring out
the pigment I know Mac isn't from the
drugstore but I don't have anything like
this from the drugstore you're also
going to see me flip my brush here and
Pat it over the blue and that's just
going to bring out the blue pigment as
well then coming in with a mac pigment
this is in vanilla and I'm just using a
very small eyeshadow brush for this
spraying it with the fix plus and then
putting this just in the inner corner of
my eye and again I know this is a
drugstore but I don't have any loose
pigment that I really really like and
when I thought of a new years eve look
this matte yellow pigment was the first
thing that came to my mind so I really
wanted to use it i hope you don't mind
i'm also going to place that in my tear
duct and then also as my brow bone
highlight
I'm going to come back in with a little
bit more of the first shade on the big
brush that I used from bhcosmetics and
plays a little bit more product and the
utter V of my eye and kind of blend them
all together
and then I decided that my inner corner
wasn't good enough so I went back in
what's the vanilla pigment and just
brightened it up and I mean you can do
this as many times as you want I think I
probably did it like a total of three or
four times you do you
and then I came back in and a blended
everything once again I just make sure
they'd look very blended and get into my
liking then I just like a makeup remover
wipe and remove any fallout the mac
government especially has a lot of
fallout on the face which is why I do
the eyes first coming in with the Knicks
two-timer liner i'm using the felt tip
side first to create a wing and i
realize this was really hard to do on
camera because i really need it both
hands to do it so i'm going to pop off
camera complete the eyeliner and then
come back but it's because the eyeliner
is not good I don't like it but then I'm
going to flip the liner over and use the
clothes liner side to do my bottom
waterline and again I don't like it I
don't recommend this eye pencil from NYX
I'm going to come back in with the first
eyeshadow shade and the same brush that
I was using to apply it to and just kind
of lightly tap that on my lower lash
line nothing crazy about this can be
optional I just like the sparkle it get
me down there then I'm going to use the
Maybelline master Prime the fuller and
illuminate primer to prime my face
sir foundation I'm using the maybelline
fit me Madame floorless and applying
that with my more cem 439 brush I want
to use this foundation in particular
communities because it doesn't have SPF
in it which means you won't get any less
harsh white flash back and you take
pictures and everyone knows on your Z's
you take a lot of pictures so I don't
want to look crazy in any of them
and I'm bringing the foundation down on
my leg like on my ear lobes up into my
hairline just making sure we don't have
any modification at all
then I might use the fit me outer and
just like a big fluffy powder brush and
I'm going to use this to set my
foundation make sure that you go
anywhere all night for concealer i'm
going to use the Maybelline fit me
concealer where's my shape is in like 10
I'm going to put that underneath my eyes
I'm going to put it on my forehead or
breaking my nose my Cupid's bow i'm also
going to put some around like my mouth
and nose area where i can to be getting
ready
and then I'm sorry I like cut out that
clip but this has been marking g2 the
buffer brush and that this is what I'm
going to be using to blossom mac
concealer and this brush since i bought
it has basically replaced the beauty
blender for me I can't remember last
time i used my BD fun turns it's very
sad my Beauty Blender it i'm happy i
love this fresh
then to set that I'm coming back in with
my ELF small keepers garage and the
Rimmel stay matte powder and i'm just
going to pop that on to all the places
that i put the concealer so late
next I'm coming in with some glitter
because this is an easy tutorial and of
course we have to have glitter this is a
gold glitter that I picked up from nicks
and I like it because I actually use the
brush to extend my winged liner out a
little bit more with the liquid from the
glitter kind of helps extend that line
and it kind of helps make it a lot more
precise I actually when I was doing my
other eye I did notes and do that and it
ended up really really liking the look
and then I'm going to also bring it down
on my lower lash line not all the way I
do it to about halfway and mostly
focusing on the inner corner coming in
with these i lure lashes and
collaboration with Vegas made the
shining star lashes and well I'm waiting
for the end users to dry I put some
define a lash mascara on my lower lashes
because you have to wait until it's
Peggy's so you can put your eyelashes on
so or to multi-task dance save that
money the usual
I also did I browser in the time I put
on the Maybelline master gel drama I
think is what they're called and then I
tried to put the lashes on on camera and
it was just too hard had to pop off put
them on and then I fixed him on camera
yeah girl coming in with the NYX matte
bronzer and a angled brush from bh
cosmetics and a bronze my face a little
bit on like my cheekbones and I'm also
going to taste this like towards my
hairline under my jaw and then I just it
just a little bit on the sides of my
nose just on my nose isn't like super
washed out has a little bit of color to
it
with blush I'm using the Milani Dolce
pink and the M I believe this is the 427
duo fiber brush brush from morphe just
placing that on the apples of my cheeks
it's a really pretty pink blush and a
hash of shimmer to it too xuxa mark and
i thought it time in with a look let me
use this real techniques is actually a
blush brush but i use it as a blending
brush just going to make sure everything
is blended any me and then i had to use
the becca and jackson pills the
champagne top highlighter i no see I got
a lot of highlighter on my brush with
time so then i'll link just eating my
brush because i went a little crazy but
it's champion Bob you have to use it on
New Year's Eve this is my favorite
highlighter right now and I actually
don't have any drugstore highlighters
that I like so I made the executive
decision to go with this one so I'm
putting it on my cheekbones I'm going to
put it down the bridge of my nose I'm
gonna make that little ball unicorn dose
on end of my nose I'm gonna cupids bow
and then I come back in for more and
you suck less I mean it's musi natural
glow like the ball
yeska love her lips I'm coming in with
the colour-pop their ultra matte
lipstick in MIDI since the eyes I just
didn't want to use a really like bold
red or gold color but I also didn't want
to go nude and i really love midi
because when i think of MIDI I think of
like an icy pink and so because this
book reminds me of like I see you know
black ice I thought what better than to
use MIDI and I don't need to use a lip
liner with the colour-pop ultra Magnus's
they work just well with help them when
I spray myself a little bit of mac fix+
and
so this is the final result I really
hope you guys liked this tutorial and
you like this video I'm really excited
for this look I think it's beautiful
this is actually a makeup look that I
used to do quite a bit when I got the
two l'oreal infallible shadows I've
actually used a look very similar to
this for a bridesmaid look I think I did
it in two different wedding my cousin in
my friend's wedding I use these shadows
because I just think they are so
beautiful and especially together they
just really make the eyes pop the lashes
now that I cut them down and I
understand like how to place them better
I really do like the lashes and they are
very affordable i do want to let you
