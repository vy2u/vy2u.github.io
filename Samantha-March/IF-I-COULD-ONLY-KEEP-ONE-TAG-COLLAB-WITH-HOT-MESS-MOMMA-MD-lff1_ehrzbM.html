today's video I'm so excited to do it is
going to be the if I could only keep one
tag that was started by my friend at
Kelly boots here on YouTube I'm so
excited to finally be doing this tag I
will of course have Kelly's video linked
it down below if you have not yet seen
it but I know a lot of people have been
doing it and I've been slowly putting my
list together but also I'm really
excited to do a today's video because it
is going to be a collab with Rhonda from
Hot Mess mama MD it will have her
channel in her video a link down below
yes if I want to do this tag video with
her and I said girl I will do this tag
video with you so make sure to head over
to Hot Mess moment and Di's at channel
to check out all of her choices that she
would keep if she could only keep a 1 in
each of these at different categories I
really love her channel she is so sweet
and also so hard-working she puts out so
many different YouTube videos and she
has a ton of different content over on
her channel she's somewhat of a newer
channel to be probably thin just like
the past couple months here so I want to
say she was recommended was a friend of
Jen loves reviews that I found her
channel perhaps and once I did I just
continually kept watching her videos she
has such a bubbly personality and she's
just super fun to watch and like I said
she puts out a lot of content a lot of
different content and she is a really
hard worker over here on YouTube and I
love chatting with her on Twitter as
well so I will have around this
information at linked in my description
box and I'm excited to see her picks for
this tag video but if you want to see
the products that I chose if I could
only keep one in these categories
I want to go ahead and get started
alrighty so first off Kelly this was a
tough one I mean Kelly did this video a
while ago and I real it was like
obviously I'm gonna do it but I was like
man this is tough and also as I was
filling it out I was trying not to
choose my favorites in each category
because it's not necessarily supposed to
be your favorites in each category it's
supposed to be if you only have that one
product in that category and you had to
continually wear it every single day so
there was different factors built into
it but I still feel like I have a lot of
my favorites in here I just really
couldn't pick other things I tried to do
all of Kelly's categories as well except
I believe she did a lipstick and a lip
gloss and I'm gonna do a lipstick and a
liquid lipstick so regular a lipstick
and liquid lipstick instead of a gloss
cuz I'm not much of a glassware
I say this today is I have gold glitter
gloss on my lips I don't Coachella is
coming out but everyone's doing festival
looks and I'm just seeing like people's
glitter splashed all over their faces
I'm like I'm gonna sponge glitter all
over my face too so I don't know but
anyway to get into my pics a for primer
this was a tough one because immediately
it went to my favorite primer and I was
like no just think about it if you're
talking every single day but I'm like I
still this is the primer that I want to
have every single day it's the smashbox
photo finish primer Iser I wanted to
wear this primer every day and there's
other primers like I have a primer in my
18 finish 18 and 20 18 project pan that
I might use that primer I have other
like mini primers that I'm trying to get
through but I want to use this primer
every single day I love the way it makes
my skin like even if I don't put a
foundation on afterwards it just
instantly gives my skin a boost it looks
more hydrated it's beautiful and no
matter like what under foundation I'm
wearing it just it still looks really
good so this would have to still be my
primer I had to do it for my foundation
awkward I don't have it in my collection
at this moment but I'm gonna get it back
I made this pact with myself because you
know obviously I'm a makeup lover I buy
a lot of makeup and I love makeup what
can I say and especially when it comes
to foundations I've gone through this
foundation kick for a while and I have a
lot of foundations so my favorite
foundation that I love is the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi foundation I ran out of
it a couple months ago and I told myself
I have to finish a foundation before I
repurchase it just because I have so
many that I have foundation like it
organizers for my foundations and I have
so many foundations I can't even fit
them into the organizers so I just have
foundations lined up next to them so I
said before you purchase that foundation
you got to finish another one so that's
that's my goal and that's what I'm
striving for but if I had to pick one
foundation to keep or to continually
wear every single day it would be the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation I
love that foundation and it was one of
the first like YouTube recommendations
for foundation that I purchased and fell
in love with as a recommendation from
Jaclyn hill I just love the foundation I
love the coverage its medium its
lightweight on the skin
it gives me a dewy finish but my skin
still looks natural when I wear it I can
wear it in the winter I can wear it in
the summer I just it's my favorite
foundation so as I was looking through
my foundations I have other ones that
you know I'm like that's my favorite too
and I had other ones but I was like you
know what if I'm if I'm talking every
single day what I have to wear every
single day it would be that foundation
and it's also impressive to me that I
did finish that foundation because like
I said I have quite the foundation
collection and obviously I mean I only
wear one foundation every day and some
days I don't wear foundation so when I
get through a full foundation that
really shows me how much I love it so it
would have to be the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi I'm gonna get it I'm almost done
with my L'Oreal pro glow I'm trying so
hard to finish it because my reward for
finishing it is getting able to buy The
True Match Lumi and I'm gonna be excited
when that day comes moving on it to
concealer again this is my favorite one
and this is another one when I looked
back at my collection I was like think
about it think about it but it still
would have to be the Urban Decay Naked
skin because I like the coverage that
gives her my under eyes it's not too
full coverage because when I went on my
Arizona trip I brought with me the Urban
Decay all nighter concealer which I
really do like but that's almost like
too full coverage and if we're talking
to something that I have to wear every
single day I could not wear something
that full coverage every single day but
I also want something with a decent
enough coverage and this one I feel like
brings it and I feel like it's good for
like spot concealing as well it's I mean
it's just I just feel like it's the best
for everyday it would have to be in the
Urban Decay Naked skin this is one that
when I go traveling a lot this is what I
bring with me because it just is like
it's just like a no-brainer
on my skin I just it's a no-brainer it's
that were indicating it gets good it's
my favorite I can't help it for bronzer
bronzer was a tough one for me because I
don't have a ton of bronzers but I feel
like the majority of my small bronzer
collection all of them are my favorite
like I'm like that's my favorite that's
my favorite that's my favorite I'm like
which one would I actually choose if I
had to have a bronzer for every single
day and what I came up with was one of
my Kern favorites
duh the Becca Capri Coast bronzer I've
talked about this one a lot recently
and I chose this one for a couple of
different reasons
it's not too light it's not too dark so
I could wear for both seasons you know I
definitely have those bronzers where I
need my summer tan to wear them
I have those bronzers that are even
lighter than this one like the
Physicians Formula is later than this
one that I have in light and so like for
the summer I wouldn't be able to wear
that what you know that sort of thing so
this one I feel like the coloring is
good for all seasons it has like this
like the slightest slightest shimmer to
it so I still think it would be pretty
for summer but it's not like a shimmer
bronzer where it's gonna be too
overwhelming so I just felt like out of
my bronzer collection this one would
make the most sense if I was talking
about wearing the same bronzer every
single day so I had to give it to Becca
Capri coast and then moving on to blush
this one was hard for me because I was
really trying to narrow it down to
single products instead of doing things
like palettes because I could have chose
like face palettes I could have chose
like highlight palettes you know things
like that but I was like no if I'm
really trying to narrow it down like
that was my challenge for myself like
narrow it down to one narrow it down to
one shade and like what would you really
pick and so I also don't have a huge
single blush collection because I'm more
of a palette girl I like my face
palettes and things like that so this
one was tough for me and I was looking I
just have two little drawers of my
single blushes and I was looking in
there and looking in there and if I had
to think of a blush color that I would
want to wear every single day I want to
wear a neutral blush I don't want
anything too shimmery I don't want
anything too pink I don't want anything
too deep I you know that sort of thing I
want it to be a very neutral blush the
most neutral blush that I could find in
my collection is this one from Tarte in
part a it was a Sephora birthday gift
like two years ago I think it was so
this is a mini guy but if I'm talking
about coloring this would be the color
because it's very nice and neutral it's
got a little bit of pink to it but for
the most part it's very neutral on me
and Tarte blushes are very pigmented so
I could you know build it up if I needed
to I could go in more light hand it and
also Tarte blushes are very long-lasting
on the skin I think these are at the 12
hour Amazonian clay and they do last for
a very long time so I would choose Tarte
parte
my neutral blush for wearing every
single day and then for highlight this
was the first highlight that popped into
my head and I was like think about it
went over to my little highlight section
my highlight section is not little this
P serious when I was in my highlight
collection and I was like think about it
think about it and again there was like
palettes I was going towards I was like
no try to stick with a single and I had
to go with my first choice my first
thought and that is the bomb mary-lou
manizer mayor lou manizer is very
special to me she was my first ever
highlight that I purchased she's
currently in my 2018 project pan because
I'm like how have I not hit pan on Mary
Lou if this is the first highlight that
I ever owned and the only highlight I
own for a while how fine I paint on this
thing it's crazy but I love this
highlight and out of all of them like I
didn't want anything that had too much
color I have some some highlights that
have like you know some purple shift to
it some pink shift to it things like
that I didn't want anything like that I
don't like to gold of a highlight on me
because that won't reflect well on my
skin all year round type of thing so I
wanted something that kind of has this
more of like a pearly more of a pearly
highlight but not straight like white
not too pearly like this one has just
like a hint of champagne in it as well
and mary-lou manizer is beautiful you
can build it up so it's a blinding on
you you can go softer and have it be
more of a natural highlight so I felt
like it would be good for just like all
occasions so if I had to choose one
highlight its gonna be my girl Mary Lou
so next time I have the eyeshadow
palette category and this one I actually
kind of got put on the spot when I did
my I believe was my Q&amp;amp;A that I did
recently I'll have that one linked down
below but someone asked me something
along the lines of if I could only keep
one eyeshadow palette and I was like man
I've already been thinking about this
question for this tag video what would
it be and in the QA I said it would be
the morphe Jaclyn hill palette I chose
this palette because it has a ton of
shades it has the 35 shades in here and
there's a huge variety of shades so if I
wanted something extremely neutral I
could get that if I wanted something
pinky I could get that I wanted
something warm I could get that if I
wanted to do pops of color like I do
occasionally I can
that in here if I want something super
deep I can get that in here there's a
lot of different shades in here
and a lot of different color
combinations I could play with if you
can tell from my palette I don't usually
have very dirty palettes I'm very light
handed with my makeup but this palette
is very very dirty because it has been
loved on and still I mean as many times
as I've gone into this palette there's
still so many different color
combinations that I could do with this
so if this was the only palette that I
could have I feel like I could still do
my neutrals and do what I want to do I
could still be able to play with makeup
and play with eye makeup looks so it
would have to be this one Jaqueline
morphe hilt this would be the palette
that I would choose and I'm just gonna
finish it off with the lip category like
I said I'm gonna do a regular lipstick
and I liquid lipstick because those are
the two that I wear most often I just
I'm not a super gloss person and
honestly if you had asked me to pick a
gloss I have no idea what I would say so
my two options here I actually have
drugstore and high-end and again for the
regular lipstick I felt like this came
in the Q&amp;amp;A as well and what I chose from
that video that kind of put me on the
spot was from Maybelline and this is the
truffle tease lipstick this is one of my
favorite lipsticks I've had this for a
very long time
I love the Maybelline lipsticks I
recommend them a ton these like kind of
like a regular guys and they're nice and
affordable this one is very creamy it's
just such a nice it's it's more of a
brown nude but it's not too overpowering
it kind of gives it just a little bit of
a not so much of a glossy look but just
a bit of Sheen to the lips as well it's
super comfortable it's one of my most
used lipsticks and it's just one of my
favorites so if I had to go with a
lipstick I mean I had to dig this one
out of my purse I was gone over the
weekend or on over the weekend this past
couple days here I was gone and this is
what I brought with me because it's just
again one of my most used lipsticks and
so because I had more of a brown nude
for my regular lipstick I wanted to do
something that was more of like a pinky
nude obviously they're both gonna be
news so I wanted to do something more in
the pinky nude variety and I was looking
at my favorite formulas for liquid
lipsticks I'm like what color would I
choose what color would I choose and
this is probably one of my most worn
liquid lipsticks at the moment and again
one that I had to bring out of my purse
it's from Hooda beauty and it is in
wifey oh I'll do swatches obviously you
can see them just I mean in case you're
new here and you've never seen these two
lipsticks ever there is a truffle tease
from Maybelline
but hooda Beauty has one of my favorite
liquid lipstick formulas it's very
different from a lot I try it's very
kind of like watery like liquidy and
such but once you put it on they stay on
I wear these to a lot of less concerts I
wore huda beauty so much a last summer
when we would go out for a long period
of time see there it is and it's just
it's such a pretty pink nude I mean it's
just it's just pretty so this is one
that I'm just reaching for a ton it's
nice and kind of like it's more of like
kind of like a neutral pink on the lips
as well but again just one of my
favorite formulas one that I feel like
lasts a really long time I have so many
of the Huda lipsticks it's kind of
ridiculous but this was this was tough
with lipsticks it really was because
there's so many others that I would want
to keep like it's a cruel thing if
you're telling me I could you know only
keep one lipstick and then I you know
kind of cheat it with too like that's
just mean but those would be it
Maybelline triple T's huda beauty wifey
and after that it's gonna do it for
today's video
I guess I was gonna be everything up for
today's video it's taking on the if I
can only keep one and tag again make
