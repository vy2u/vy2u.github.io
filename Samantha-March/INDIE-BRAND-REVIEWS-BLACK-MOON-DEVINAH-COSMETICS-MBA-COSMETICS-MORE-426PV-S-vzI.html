today's video is going to be a review
style video it's going to be focused on
indie brands so I did a video similar to
this about a month ago and it got some
really good feedback I think people like
to see indie brands newer brands friends
that aren't talked about maybe as much
and so I thought I would come back and
do another review style video said I do
have a few different brands here that
I'm going to be chatting about and
reviewing a some products I have the
Black Moon cosmetics orb of light full
moon palette I also have some single
shadows from Divina cosmetics
I have glitters from MBA cosmetics and
then at the end I'm also going to be
reviewing a few products from persona
cosmetics and also a dominique cosmetics
so we've a lot to get through today so
while we go ahead and get started so I'm
gonna kick it off with this palette
right here this is from Black Moon
cosmetics it is called their orb of
light a full moon palette so this is
what the packaging looks like and when
you open it you do have a mirror and
then you have these eight shadows here
this palette is $48 and can be found on
the black moon cosmetics website I will
have everything linked down below I will
also be doing a close-up shots and also
swatches of all of the products that I'm
going to be talking about there are
eight shades in here they are all matte
and kind of when I look at this palette
I immediately kind of get like fall
vibes like I don't know if this sounds
weird but when I look at this palette
like I think of leaves I am also really
attracted to the shades in this palette
I love how we have this big shade here
and every time I use this palette I
always use that shade I'm someone who's
a really big fan of setting my eyeshadow
primer with a really light colored shade
like this one and I love when I go into
a palette I love being able to do a full
look with one palette and I always need
that shade and you know a lot of
palettes don't have it and so I'm always
reaching into another one first so I can
put that down so then I can start my eye
look so I do like that we have that one
this the first one right here but if
they do have names yes this is
strawberry I don't think I would have
guessed that was its name
strawberry there's the shade names are
on the back here I'm a strawberry it's a
very light color
but it's really nice to kind of blend
out colors on your crease if you don't
want anything too deep or you know too
dramatic to change a look it's nice for
that for an inner corner or to just
lighten up the look sometimes when I'm
doing it all matte look I'll kind of
really put like the emphasis on the
outer part of the eye and I'll kind of
just leave the inner part of my eye a
completely blank but sometimes it just
needs a little something but I don't
want shimmer I don't want Sparkle I
don't want glitter I can come in with a
pretty light shade like this and just
kind of liven things up make it look a
little bit lighter in there the second
shade here is called cold then shades
are kind of funny this shade is kind of
interesting because it's kind of like a
brown gray but it's not too intimidating
this is kind of a color that I look at
it and I think mud on my eyes you know
and I start blending it I'm like that
gonna be real muddy girl it's really not
that intimidating when I put it onto my
lids it's still it's not my most reached
for shade out of this palette a shade
that I really love out of this palette
is the next one here which is called
worm which is I really cool it's just
that kind of like mustard yellow color I
think this color is so cool when I saw
this palette first come out that was
kind of the first shade that my eyes
went to I've done that quite a few looks
with this shade here and I think it's
beautiful I think it's beautiful to pack
on the lid I think it's beautiful to put
into the crease I feel like you have
some different uses of this color but I
just think it's really a really cool
color and the next shade as well I'm
also really into this color which is
called harvest this one is just like a
cool it's just kind of like a cool rusty
orange shade I would say I'm not the
best of describing shades of course but
that shade is also very fun again you
can pack it onto the lids you can put it
into the crease I think all of the
shades in here for the most part are
very blendable and I feel like I've been
able to use them very well and even the
shapes that I am packing all over to the
lid I feel like I don't have to play
with them a lot like I feel like this
there's a very good quality of the
shadows in here but this shade I'm also
and then like these two together mmm
loving it the next shade in here is
called blood okay that makes sense to me
this is something that I don't use
a ton either I will say it's just not
it's a shade that intimidates me I mean
I'll just I'll just go ahead and say
that I'm color and just shades outside
of my comfort zone they intimidate me so
this is one that I haven't used a ton of
and I think the first time that I used
it I was kind of just blending it into
the to the crease and I didn't find it
to be as blendable of some of the other
ones and then especially because it's a
darker color and it's more of a red I
kind of was like what I don't know this
is a good idea the same with this one
here you know darker colors sometimes
can be harder to blend I'm also not a
blend master so you know I always try to
keep that in mind
but sometimes darker colors can be
harder for me or they can just take
longer and I have like patients like my
patience level is not great so that can
be in too but I do like that we have a
deeper Brown I feel like all of these
colors like I feel like they all go
together I I will say this one pulls
more Brown this one pulls a little bit
more of like a grey to me but I kind of
wish that there was something different
with these two like these ones right
here I feel like this is more orange
this is more red but these I don't know
I just feel like they're similar and
then especially because we have a black
in here too I just wished maybe there
would have been a different color in
there but honestly like I don't even
know it like I'm not someone who does
free designing palette videos because I
don't know what I'm talking about but I
will say that and the black is nice
again I don't use black a ton in my
palettes I have used that one one time I
used it as like a shadow liner which I
did not do a lot I think it was one of
the first times I used this palette now
what what do I doing this was a terrible
idea but it actually looked really good
like that I've also used it on the lower
lash line as well and I thought that
that one was a nice shadow overall for
the quality of the shadows in here I
will say that I was very impressed for
the most part everything seemed to work
really well is $48 you do get eight
shades that is pricey
you know sometimes indie brands do have
to be higher price can I understand that
but sometimes it is a bit of a bummer
but I would still recommend this palette
I've had a really good time using it I
like the shades in here I find myself
reaching for this palette and kind of
just being inspired
to do something a little different than
my norm when I go into this one so I
really do enjoy it now as we get into
the spring summer months typically my
makeup goes a little bit on the lighter
side so I don't know how much I'll reach
for it now
but especially once fall starts coming
around which I don't even want to talk
about cause like we frighten I just got
warm weather but ones that does like
this is like such a beautiful fall
palette to me and I can see me trying to
do that leaf look you know what I'm
saying but for the first product that I
tried from Blackmon cosmetics I was very
impressed so next up I want to talk
about Divina cosmetics now Divina
cosmetics I feel like I first really
started hearing about them from my
friend Angelica here on YouTube I was
talking to her one day about you know I
just love the looks that she creates
with her eyeshadows and all of this and
she actually purchased some from Divina
cosmetics and sent them to me so it's
not a Davina cosmetics sent them to me
it was angel liquor that sent him to me
and I was like thank you so much girl I
was so excited and she chose out my
shades for me we've done a collab video
like that too I'll put that down below
but I thought that was really sweet so I
just have them in one of my big Z
palettes here and the shades that are
from Divina cosmetics are these ones
right here not the contour shade but
these eyeshadow shades right here
looking at the Divina cosmetics website
it looks like the majority of their
single eyeshadows are 5 dollars which is
super affordable I think that's amazing
notice on their website too they have
kind of bundles on there that are there
they go by month like February
bestsellers March bestsellers things
like that I thought that was really cool
do you have a tutorial on my Instagram I
will leave it listed down below it's for
a all red look that I did and I was
using the Davina cosmetic shadows and
Angelica said she was so proud of me
that I did something kind of outside of
my comfort zone I did read yeah girl
thank you but kind of like the the star
of the show of that tutorial I would say
was this shadow right here which is in
blazed so they do have the names on the
back again I'll do close-ups of each
shadow and I will also swatch each one
and be inserting those so you can see
what they look like but wow I am in
pressed with these single shadows okay I
am very impressed if you are someone who
you
like the single shadows you'd like to
kind of create your own little pellets
together you prefer it that way instead
of buying a pellet and you're not gonna
use all the shades in there check out
Divina cosmetics because I have tried
all of the shades that she sent me I've
tried them all of my eyes and there's
really not a one that I'm like nope I
didn't like that one
so blaze was a beautiful red and it has
a bit of a sheen to it
this one right here though is also
really gorgeous this is called I'm just
a I'm just a damned wine well would you
look at that and how beautiful is that
color and it translates on the eyes so
so well I think that shade is gorgeous
the other ones she sent me are mostly
mattes this shade super cool reminds me
of the Black Moon cosmetics this one is
in Courtenay desmo is a really beautiful
purple if I can show you here I mean
really I'm just I'm really impressed
with these shadows for the price of them
I think they're amazing the quality of
them I think that they are great I
really want to I want to kind of like
make my own little palette with singles
like I kind of want to what word am I
trying to come up with I want to
challenge myself to do that and I've
I've kind of started already like
thinking about like my perfect shades
that I would put in there and all that
you know I'm just so inspired by
somebody my friends on YouTube that have
such creative minds they really they
really push me like Angelica
you know LS Georgia all the girls I'm
always talking about but they really do
inspire me so I really want to do that
but I would definitely be looking at the
Divina cosmetics website because I think
the quality of these shadows are so so
good so I would love to know if you guys
have tried Divina again we're looking up
here I would love to know if you've
tried Divina cosmetics as well but I
would recommend so next I might have
just a few products to talk about here
from MBA at cosmetics so MBA cosmetics I
believe it stands for my beauty
addiction I am pretty sure so I feel
like they are pretty like most
well-known afford their glitters so I
have two glitters to talk about and then
kind of like my glitter glue that I was
using so NBA cosmetics they did reach
out to me and I got to pick out the
products that I want to try so I picked
out a pressed glitter in ballerina
and then also the chroma lights foil
effects glitter in prismatic ax and then
I wanted to get a glitter glue as well
because I mean these are glitter so they
they are not an adhesive at all to your
eyes so you they recommend right on the
website to use something to help you
know kind of pick them stick on your
eyes so I thought I would just go ahead
and try out their product as well um so
I of course will have their website
listed down below the foil FX glitter
was $10 the pressed glitter was $7 and
then the glitter foil and line FX was
650 what I want to start off by saying
is that I don't wear glitter a lot
especially when it comes to glitter like
these I feel like there's a lot of user
error on my end and I can get a little
bit overwhelmed with glitter the easiest
glitters I have found to wear myself are
the Stila glitters because I just feel
like they're so easy to swipe onto the
eyes and then you're done so I was a
little bit more intimidated by these and
so I just want to I just want to point
that out so the first one that I tried
here was the ballerina again I will go
ahead and put in a swatch photo that I
did on Instagram that I shared so this
one here is ballerina and I mean it is
really really beautiful okay and it was
the pink glitter I was very excited
about this but I instantly got very
overwhelmed when I was putting this on
my eyes I just struggled and that's it's
just really why I want to say that I
don't do this a lot I don't do this
technique a lot I'm still very new to
like loose or pressed glitters like this
and I just I struggled and at one point
like I just had glitter all over my face
and I really tried and I really wanted
to love it I just was not good at it I
wasn't good at it I don't know what else
I can say um when I was trying to apply
it onto my eye it was just kind of going
on in like pageants like you just I
didn't do a very good job and I both are
back so I feel like I'm not doing it
justice and I want to keep practicing I
do but when I got done
so like once I realized this was not
gonna go well okay I'm just gonna try
the other glitter on the other eye and I
just the same thing was kind of
happening even though this is a pressed
glitter it kind of comes off on the
brush it's like pretty chunky and I
don't know if that's where my struggle
was that it just didn't look seamless it
didn't look it didn't look like everyone
else on Instagram I'm doing it and I was
like dang it girl this is your fault so
I would recommend these if you're good
at glitter or you know maybe if you want
to practice if you're not good at it if
glitter is not your thing and you don't
have any interest in them I I don't
think you need to run out and get these
but if it is more of your style your
thing and you know what you're doing I
think that these could be pretty nice I
just felt like I had a lot of user error
with it
the pink one did look pretty though and
then I tried this one here now this one
is ten dollars versus the seven dollars
but you do get a larger pan so here is
what this is prismatic ax was pretty
cool too but again I just I mean it's
the same thing I just struggled the same
way on the other eye and then of course
glitter is glitter and I don't know when
I was having troubles with the first one
I tried to add more glue when I was
going in with this one because I also
realized I was getting a lot of glitter
fallout onto my face and kind of at the
end I mean I kind of look like Georgia
Harris in her video the other day no I'm
just getting she had glitter all over a
raisin it was so but I clicked on the
video I was like yes girl this is all
her friends she cracks me up but I
definitely had a lot of glitter on my
face I had to take a lot of time to
remove all of the glitter I had to wash
my face again and all of that
I just glitter like this is just hard
for me to work with and just not my
personal favorite but for the actual
products they do seem nice will also say
that you know they do have the
disclaimers on their website and I think
it was on which one it was on the back
of ballerina they're not cosmetic
approved and on the website it says you
know the glitters aren't FDA tested and
they're not recommended for cosmetic use
I think a lot of glitters are that way
but I'm just gonna throw that one out
there but I don't think the prices are
bad on these glitters and I mean just to
give an idea of the of the size
comparison so this one is seven dollars
and this one is ten dollars I mean I
think that you would have these for a
very long time and you know they could
take you pretty far I just would
recommend if you know what you're doing
if you're comfortable or you're willing
to try um I don't know how often I'll be
reaching for these because like I said I
would just prefer the Stila glitters I
feel like they're quicker and they're
faster for me to use and they're more
user-friendly for me personally it was
fun to try these I wish they would have
worked out a little bit better for me
but for the actual quality you know just
reviewing without user error I do think
they are nice
so that's MBA cosmetics glitters so next
up I want to finish off with domine
cosmetics and also persona Cosmetics now
these are both brands that were started
by bloggers I'm going to talk about
dominique cosmetics first and the latte
palette so dominique cosmetics was
started by kristen dominique who is a
blogger and youtuber i wasn't I'm not a
hundred percent if these are both indie
brands so I wanted to put them towards
the end I couldn't find anything stating
they were or seeing they weren't but I
thought I would include them they're
newer brands you know they were started
by female entrepreneurs which I thought
was really cool started by fellow
youtubers and I just thought it would
make a good addition for these videos
indie brands can be a little bit tough
to decipher which one is Indian which
one is not because an indie brand means
it's an independently owned brand some
people think that that means that you
can only purchase via their website and
that's not necessarily the truth or the
case it's not that serious but like for
example dose of colors is an independent
brand but they are now sold at Ulta Too
Faced cosmetics was an independent brand
for a very long time and they were sold
at Sephora and Ulta as well they are no
longer in Indy brand because they were
bought out by Estee Lauder but it's not
something as simple as where the
products are sold it depends on who owns
the company and sometimes it's hard to
find that information online but I hope
that makes sense but I thought I would
still be able to review these products
now the first one I want to review like
I said is the latte palette from
dominique cosmetics you can find this on
there
site and then also on alta it is a $42
palette you get ten shades inside and
you also get a mirror first palette is
the latte palette and she has the
lemonade palette coming soon I don't
believe what you've seen the inside of
it yet though but I'm curious to see
what she comes up with I was very
impressed by the packaging of this
palette I like the big Almir that we
have in here and the pallet sizes of the
shade sizes I mean they're pretty decent
in here I thought that was pretty cool
liked it the shade selection in here I
think it's very pretty and I feel like
this is definitely a palette where I can
create a full look with it I like it for
me personally because I do like neutrals
and I do like my warm brown smokey eyes
I do them a lot it's kind of one of my
fallback looks but I like that we do
have you know a couple pops of color in
here that are fun I like the addition of
the shimmer shades in here as well it is
mostly mattes in here but I like the
three shimmers and I like that through
the three shimmers are different enough
from one another I've used all three
shades and they're different enough
which I appreciate
I'm getting a lot of kick up in the
palette when you dip into the palette I
noticed that right away and I get zero
fallout on my face when I use these
shadows I think everything is very
blendable I will say that I feel like
you have to kind of build shadows up
which isn't always a bad thing because
especially because these are easy to
blend sometimes it's not a bad thing to
build up instead of being too intense
and too overboard right away and then
really trying to like tame your look
down so for me I feel like it's a good
palette also for beginners or you know
someone who maybe doesn't have the
blending skills like some people do on
YouTube and Instagram I feel like it's a
really nice palette for that I do have
it on my eyes today and I did film this
look for Instagram so this tutorial will
be going up on my Instagram soon I think
this is a beautiful palette I'm very
impressed with it I'm very impressed by
the quality of it I like the packaging
of it $42 again is more expensive again
if we're going off Dominik cosmetics
being an indie bran sometimes any brands
can be more expensive like I was saying
it's really cool and really exciting
that it's sold at Ulta amuse your points
and also has a great reward system so I
mean a huge congratulations to Kristen
Dominique this made creating a brand I'm
sure is very difficult to be able to get
into alta is very M
and I'm just I'm impressed by this
palette I would recommend it I'm gonna
finish it off with two products are from
a persona cosmetics so I have the
identity eyeshadow palette and then also
the Cali glow highlighter in Zuma these
bird bones sent to me from a persona
cosmetics they actually saw one of my
boy I bite videos where I was talking
about the highlighter and end up sending
me over a highlighter and the palette
which I was super excited about what I'm
gonna talk about the palette first this
has been out longer than the
highlighters so this is the identity
palette so I think the packaging on it
is super super cute and then inside you
also do get a mirror and then you get 12
different shades and this one is $32
persona cosmetics was started by Sonia
from simply Sonia who is a blogger and
youtuber as well and then you can find
these on the persona website and they
also are available at Ulta which is
super cool
I feel like Ulta is really like doing
the most right now with getting new
brands in there I've been really curious
about this eyeshadow palette because I
hear so many good things I don't know if
I've really heard a lot of negatives
about this palette it seems like a lot
of people really like it I enjoy the
packaging it feels nice and sturdy I
like that we get that Mir and there the
shade sizes are pretty large as well I
think $32 is a spot-on great price for
this eyeshadow palette I really do you
get the twelve shades in there I like
these tones in here these are definitely
like my vibes and my tones and the
shadows are very very nice they're very
easy to blend the shimmers in here are
so beautiful especially this sassy here
boom I mean you don't even need a
setting spray or a damp brush for sassy
I love putting sassy on my inner corner
for just like a bright inner corner that
shade is so so beautiful I also enjoyed
that we have humble in here again it's
just kind of that first shade that I put
all over my lid it's very like a light
pink shade when my favorites out of here
are kind of these three right here
charming audacious and chic I love that
chic is more on the purple side because
I'm really into that right now as well
but of course like the Browns and the
oranges I think those are beautiful
maverick was just a little bit like a
little little bit hard for me to blend
again we're kind of going into a darker
shade there it could just be me but I
thought I would mention that
some of these other shimmers in here
gold-digger is absolutely beautiful it's
a fantastic gold I don't know what it's
gonna I think I was gonna set goals and
then bombshell I really like the
bombshell color as well and it was one
of the first shimmers that I used out of
this palette and I don't know if I
really knew what this is going to
translate to on my eyes and I'm
literally gonna do a swatch so I can
kind of try to explain it as I'm looking
at it it almost has like an all of kind
of undertone to it but it's just it's
really cool it's a really cool shade
some shades are better than the others I
think but overall I think this is a
really really nice palette I think the
quality is there I'm very impressed with
it for $32 I don't think you can go
wrong one thing I will say though is
that I just feel a little bit limited
and the looks that I'm going to create
with this which might seem strange
because like like I said like I like
these tones
I like these vibes but if I were to put
this against the latte palette I'm
actually reaching for the latte palette
more because like we just have that
purple in there and the blue in there
and I don't I don't know what it is I
just I feel like I can create more looks
with that palette and I feel like when I
come into this one I'm kind of doing the
same things with just like a little
variation to them I think maybe what I'm
saying by that is that this is a really
good neutral palette like especially for
if you don't really want to think about
you know some days I have I have those
moments where I'm like I can't really
think too much I need to do one of my
go-to looks I can reach in this and do
this and maybe if you go to an office
job this could be a good palette for you
and that's not necessarily a bad thing
but it's just something that I realized
about this when I noticed I wasn't
reaching into it as much as I was some
of the other palettes just something
that I wanted to touch on but that can
be a pro and it can be a con I just
wanted to throw it out there that that's
what I think about the identity palette
but overall I think this is really good
I think you're getting good quality out
of it and I'm excited to see what their
next I shadow palette will be like and
then also the highlights these are a new
release from persona cosmetics and they
are called the Cali glow highlights and
I got mine sent to me in Zuma and Zuma
is described as a champagne pearl love
the packaging on these these are $24
nice sturdy packaging big ol highlight
nice mirror very impressed by this $24
for one highlight is more expensive but
again you can also find them at Ulta but
I think the the packaging the quality is
there and you're getting a really large
highlight which for some is great for me
it is a good thing and I always touch on
it but I've never had a pan on a
highlight so so sometimes size really
doesn't matter to me you know what I'm
saying
okay this is the highlight that I have
on my cheeks today and we'll pal all
right would you just look at that would
you just look at that this is a stunning
highlight this is so stunning the first
time I used it I was like you are not
here to play are you persona cosmetics
no if you love beaming highlights super
easy to just move on to the face then
you can check out the Cali glow
highlighters because these are pretty
darn phenomenal the only con that I will
say about this one is that it does have
some glitter in it and when I opened it
I could tell right away that it had some
glitter to it I was like oh no oh no
this is not gonna go well but it really
doesn't translate to the skin it really
doesn't I don't feel like it looks like
I have flecks of glitter on me I just I
really don't I feel like it's such a
smooth and beautiful highlight like if I
look really really close maybe I can
tell but you know like for real although
I think it looks very smooth it's very
beautiful I'm super super impressed by
these if you're on the hunt for a new
highlighter I would definitely recommend
these again the price is just a little
bit high for a single highlighter but
it's not the most expensive out there I
mean the Becca highlights are $38 and
all that jazz but overall I'm very very
impressed with these I believe they have
three different colors that you can
choose from great packaging great
product
nail it I guess that's gonna do it for
