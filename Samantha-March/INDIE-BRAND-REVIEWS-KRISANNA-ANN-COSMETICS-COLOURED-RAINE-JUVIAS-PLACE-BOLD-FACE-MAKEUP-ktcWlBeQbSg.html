today's the video is going to be some
makeup reviews and I'm going to be
focusing this video on indie brands I've
been wanting to start an indie brand
like some sort of series of for a while
now and I have a bunch of products here
a lot that are newer to me and some that
are newer to the market as well and I
really wanted to be able to review them
so I thought I could kind of compile
them all together and just do one big
review video focusing on some indie
brands I know Lisa Stevens also does a
lot of really good indie brand that
videos as well I'll have her channel
link down below in case you want to see
more videos on indie brands but I
definitely want to be doing more of
these there's a lot of brands that I
think would be really cool to spotlight
if you guys are interested in this idea
and you like the style of video please
of course do let me know but I have a
lot of reviews to get through today so
why don't I go ahead and jump into it
the first time I'm gonna start with one
of my favorite indie brands this is
Chris Anna and at cosmetics I have been
wearing Christina and cosmetics products
for I'm gonna say two years now I also
really love the owner of this brand I
feel like she's really supportive of
influencers and also her customers as
well I see her reposting and reshare and
people all the time which is so awesome
she did ask me if I wanted to do a
giveaway with her and I said yes this is
not a sponsored video or anything but
she emailed me a couple weeks ago and
asked if I would want to do a giveaway
and I had this indie brand kind of
review style video on my list for a
while and so I said that I could put a
giveaway into this video so if you're
interested we are going to be doing a
giveaway together I will have the link
down below to enter and all of the other
details down there and she is going to
give away a lot to one winner so she has
recently come out with these magnetic
pallets and you can see I have her
single shadows in here so she's giving
away a magnetic palette all of her
single shadows also her olympus
eyeshadow palette she is letting one
winner choose an eye brow pomade she has
several different shades and an eye brow
pomade so the winner can choose their
best shade and then also two of her
liquid lipsticks so I feel like that's a
pretty cool prize so make sure to check
out the link in the description
and I thought that was really cool when
I like I gave an idea of what to do for
the giveaway and she legitimately
doubled it I was like okay yeah you go
girl like this is awesome make sure to
get entered in the giveaway if you are
interested in winning those prizes also
I do have a discount code with the
Kristina and Cosmetics I've had it for
quite some time it is just March beauty
and you get 20% off your order but
chrisannan actually up to the discount
code to 50% off for the next few days
here I'll have the dates down below for
when it will be 50% off but I know it's
gonna start the day that I posted this
video so if there's anything that you
want to purchase from her website like I
said she has single shadows eyeshadow
palettes magnetic pellets if you're in
the market for that eyebrow pomades
liquid lipsticks etc everything will be
50% off with the code March Beauty so I
thought that was pretty cool of her to
do it is a affiliate discount code I do
want to let you guys know so I wouldn't
make a commission off of that like I
said I have been a supporting Kristina
and cosmetics for quite some time now
and I do recommend the brand I have one
of her single shadows on my eyes today
and what the single shadows are probably
my favorite thing that she has released
now I just love them so much and what
I'm actually going to be reviewing today
is three of her new shades these first
of three in my magnetic palette here are
her newest shades so I'm going to be
reviewing those but I wanted to let you
guys know about the giveaway and then
also at the 50% off on her website
because I thought those are both pretty
amazing I'll also have Christina Ann's
YouTube channel linked it down below and
also her Instagram so you want to make
sure to go check her out in an is also a
cruelty free brand in case you were
curious and then like I said I do have
these three shades here that I want to
talk about because they are new to her
single eyeshadow collection and she does
have all of these other ones also they
are either $6 or $7 the three that I'm
going to be talking about are all six
dollars or you can also get these three
in a collection it's called the fates
collection and it's $15 for three or $6
if you want to purchase them
individually the first one here is
called truffles I probably not going to
be saying these names that correctly but
this one is a matte shade I have it
swatch on my hand right here it's a
really beautiful kind of like that
burgundy wine color and again this one
is
Matt and then the next two I have are
shimmers first one here is what I have
on my eyes today I love the screen I'm
totally feeling inspired by st. Patty's
right now this is called clothes oh I
believe is what it is so it's a really
cool green shimmer I'll go ahead and do
a swatch as well so you can see it her
shimmers are just gorgeous
like beautiful beautiful I do spray my
brush with a setting spray for almost
every shimmer that I use so I do apply
this with a damp brush as well but it's
so easy to apply it's so easy to get on
the eyes I did film an Instagram
tutorial of this a look as well so if
it's up I will have it in my description
box linked it down below if it's not yet
I do a mini tutorial almost every single
day on my Instagram so if you're ever
curious about I looks or things like
that face makeup etc I do a lot of mini
tutorials over there so I'm just March
Beauty word over on Instagram the last
one I have here I'm really not going to
be able to pronounce like esa's I was
probably not even close at all so here
is what this one looks like it looks
like a penny and I wish I would have
done that on camera that was just shoot
I don't think I'm gonna you could tell I
didn't cut the film at all there but
that one is so so stunning I mean it
really I don't know how else to describe
it other than it looks like a penny it's
really beautiful kind of like copper but
shimmer shade at the same time this one
is really really stunning so these are
the three swatches of her new single
eyeshadows I think all three of them are
gorgeous like I said her eyeshadow
singles are so good in quality if you
like the makeup geek eyeshadows singles
I mean that is honestly what I would
compare these two they swatch
beautifully but not only did they swatch
beautifully they perform on the eyes so
well again I have the green on my eyes
today and I think it's absolutely
beautiful
again those are three of her newer
shades in the fates collection I'll have
it linked down below as well and then
you can see that she does have other
single shadows also if there's a
different color that you prefer I have
used all of them and I really enjoyed
all of them the purple might be my
favorite I just wore this one not too
long ago the purple is called NYX or NYX
this one might be my favorite the blue
is really beautiful as well and the gold
they're just really good single
eyeshadows
I would highly recommend them but those
are the new releases from Christina Anna
cosmetics also we're doing a giveaway
and you got 50% off the website
oh so next up I want to review with the
colored rain
Queen of Hearts I shall appellate I got
this palette recently sent to me from my
subscriber which I was so excited about
this palette when it came out I mean I
don't think anybody really saw the
success of this palette coming I don't
think cold rain sound the success of
this palette coming but this got hyped
so much on YouTube and Instagram it was
selling out they would put it for
pre-sale and then it would go on so and
it would sell out again like it was so
crazy and it was so hard to get your
hands on I tried a couple of times and I
eventually just gave up so I was so
excited to receive this in my peel box
because I really didn't want to try it
and I really did see I really didn't
want to see is it worth the hype Ellard
rain is still a fairly small brand I
would say they have come out with some
new eyeshadow palettes recently they
have smaller eyeshadow palettes they
just did release a new bigger eyeshadow
palette but I feel like the Queen of
Hearts is kind of what really put them
on the map here the inside has been
compared kind of to the Anastacio modern
renaissance you have a mixture of the
matte shimmers um you do have a nice
mirror I like the packaging I like the
shade selections inside also and I've
used this palette now either four or
five times I've used it I've used it
several times and I really wanted to
play with it and play with the the max
play with the shimmers and see what I
thought about all of them and what I
will say is that I really really like
this palette I think it's really good I
think it delivers I understand why
people were so hyped about this palette
the max blend easily they show up well
the shimmers are really really gorgeous
I used the shimmer not too long ago this
purple one in here and it was beautiful
and sometimes purple shadows they can be
a bit of a struggle so when you find a
good purple one like the Kristina Han
one that I just mentioned the purple in
here I've even used this purple over
here that one was really pretty as well
I get excited for those because
sometimes Purple's look so beautiful in
the eyeshadow palettes or in the pans
and then it just does not correlate the
same way on the eyes and it's so
disappointing but this one I feel like
is actually really really good
the packaging is so hard being so
reflective on camera here but this is a
really really nice eyeshadow palette I
like to packaging I like the mirror I
like to shade inside I think that they
perform really well but it is a $50 I
shadow palette and I do think that's
pretty expensive as I it's it's a
struggle for me because I understand
that sometimes indie brands do have to
charge more but at the same time it's
kind of a struggle because you know I
prefer to produce from Sephora and Ulta
and get points or eBay's or something
have some sort of kickback somewhere
like I'm a deal chaser I don't like
paying full price for things I want some
sort of deal somehow to slip in there so
$50 I still feel like is really really
high but I still do really enjoy this
palette and I would recommend it I just
feel like you know maybe I have a
special coming up I've gave only seen
this go like on special like one time
but maybe it will happen again but if
you are willing and you know you you
have the $50 and you really do want to
spend it on a good quality eyeshadow
palette I think that you will get this
in the Queen of Hearts palette I would
recommend it I just wish the price tag
wasn't quite so high but I can
understand it but definitely I do
understand what the hype is about I feel
like I can create gorgeous looks with
this honestly I would still if I had to
choose between those in my modern
Renaissance I would still choose the
modern renaissance there's just a few
more shades in there just a few more
this a little bit more versatile for me
but this one is still really gorgeous
and I would recommend the color green
Queen of Hearts I think it's a really
good eye shadow palette so I have been
very lucky to receive as some adieu be
is a place and palettes from subscribers
over the past month or two here which
has been awesome because I only owned
one dubious place palette prior to that
is the mini of masquerade palette and
I've been curious about the brand I've
wanted to try more from that but I have
three pallets here that are a bit newer
to jubie's plays and are all you know
fairly new to me but I've tried them out
several times now and I thought that I
could review these so I have the deuce a
palette this I believe is the newest
palette or the festival palette I can't
remember they put out a lot of palettes
this is one of their newer palettes and
I actually just mentioned this in
February makeup monthly and in the
favorite sections so you know that that
means that I love this palette I use
this in creating a makeup look I did a
Babs Beauty inspired Valentine's Day
tutorial and I use this palette and when
I did I was like oh man
oh and I really like this palette I
actually have it on my eyes today as
well I used these two shades at the
bottom here to create this I look in
part with the Christina and a single
shadow that I used but I just love this
palette I'll leave my video linked down
below because I did review it a little
bit more in that makeup monthly but oh
the color selection of most Juvia spice
palettes intimidates me because i'm not
the best with color i'm not the best at
looking at a palette and being able to
think of a makeup look for whatever
reason this palette just it just speaks
to me I love the pinks
I love the greens in here I love this
pinky shade right here I think it's
beautiful I feel like I can create some
really fun looks with it and I've
reached for this palette quite a bit so
this one is definitely a favorite of
mine all these palettes are twenty one
fifty on the Judy's place website so I
also have been here the festival palette
by dubious place I did do a first
impression style video with this one
I'll have that one link down below in
case you're interested in seeing it this
one was definitely one when I opened it
like I get very overwhelmed looking at
this because this is a lot of color to
me this is a lot of brightness this is a
lot of like my brain doesn't know what
to think when I look at this palette but
I still feel like I've created some
really fun looks with this and one thing
that I'll say about this palette is that
even though these shades are very bright
and they can look very intimidating they
aren't they they don't really do that on
the eyes like I was worried like it
coming in with this red or this pink or
the orange like I was afraid that I
would put my brush down and it would
just be like a splash of color you can't
blend it out it's just it's like it's
too much but they're actually not quite
as colorful on the eyes and it's easy to
build them up and I personally think
that that's a good thing if it's like
too colorful too much too hard to blend
you can have a very messy eye look that
you're not going to love but I enjoy the
fact that that you can build these up
and they aren't too overwhelming right
away to me that actually does help I do
like this palette and I've created a few
looks with it some of my favorite shades
like I really love is kind of like a
mustardy color over here
and the gold is really pretty and then I
like having that option to do something
different and and more creative and
colorful if I ever am feeling those
vibes with this red and this orange I
enjoyed the look that I created in my
first impression video kind of more of
like a sunset i but that's kind of the
biggest thing is what I would say if
you're interested in the festival pilot
but maybe you're a little intimidated by
it just know that you will kind of have
to work with the shades and build them
up and again personally I think that's a
good thing so I would say that's good if
you're intimidated by it but that is the
festival pellets still really good
quality I still just prefer the deuce a
pellet the most out of the three that
I'm talking about but probably my second
favorite I would say if I was ranking
these three I think this one would go
right in the middle and this is the
Saharan - this is also 2150 same style
same concept inside I do like that
they're a bit cheaper they don't have a
mirror which is kind of a bummer
for me personally I know that doesn't
matter to everybody but for me I like
when any of my palettes have mirrors
it's just much more helpful for me but I
do like the affordability and I think
there's also influencers that do have
discount codes for like 10% off for
things like that I don't have one myself
but I'm pretty sure I've seen that
floating around so you can get it even a
bit cheaper and sometimes they do have
bundles on their website also so there's
a couple pilots are interested in it you
might be able to get a bundle and of
course I'll have the Julius place
website link down below I think I like
this palette the second most because
it's kind of more me and kind of more my
style because you do have these
beautiful shimmers of the first six
shades here are all shimmers but they're
kind of more on the neutral side but
there's also like there's also like a
hint of something else like shade right
here I use it the other day it's kind of
a really cool like peachy shimmer color
but it has a lot of orange in it so I
like it looks it it doesn't look as
intense in the pan but when you actually
put it on I think it's really beautiful
and then you also kind of have this
really cool kind of like mermaid ishes
style color there which i think is
really cool it's kind of like maybe like
a seafoam green I would say and that's a
really beautiful shimmer and then you
also have this kind of like bright
electric blue and that shade is really
gorgeous as well so you can kind of do
you can kind of go both ways with this
palette
you can do something more neutral or you
can amp it up as well and I like the
versatility of that I like that you do
also get these three matte shades and I
feel like they did a great job putting
these matte shades in there I don't
necessarily have like my normal
traditional crease color because they're
all just a little bit on the darker side
but I still like having them you can
deepen up an eye look you can use it for
lower lash I mean it's makeup you can
use it for whatever you want I do reach
for the shade quite a bit and this one
here it looks kind of more like a
burgundy in the pan but it actually
comes off more pink on the eyes that's
something I'll say about that there's a
swatch of it there I mean I don't know
if you'll be able to tell for sure with
a swatch but stay tuned I believe it's
gonna be tomorrow's video you're gonna
see a lot of these dubious plays
palettes you're also gonna see a little
something different from me so
tomorrow's video will be pretty exciting
but this one definitely actually comes
out pretty pink on the eyes which I feel
like is different from what you're
seeing in the pan but like I said I like
the versatility of this one I like the
different looks that you can create I
like like I do like that it has a lot of
shimmers in here I'm more of a matte
person but I feel like with those mats I
feel like I can still create a fun look
and I just like the selection of
shimmers in here I think it's a really
cool palette so this would probably be
my second favorite out of the three from
Julia's place now that I've mentioned
but juvey explains I feel like they have
a really good quality eyeshadow palettes
I like their affordability and I do like
the brand a lot so those are my reviews
afford these three dubiously styles so
the next time I do want to talk about a
pair of lashes and another indie brand
of course obviously if you guys are new
to my channel I just prefer lashes I
have like really weak little lashes and
I just have always preferred false
lashes the E is news and use before
YouTube and everything
I just love lashes so this brand is
called bold face makeup I seen them I
think how I first heard about them was
through Nicole Renee Cutler I really
loved her youtube channel
I'll have her link down below but she
started talking about this brand and I
was very curious about it I love finding
new brands especially like I'm trying to
incorporate more indie brands onto my
channel but I also love lashes so when
she started recommending them I was
pretty curious about them they actually
have a subscriber send these to me which
I was super excited to be able to try
them out and it was funny because I was
just getting ready to make my purchase I
had I think four lashes already
carton and Jenaya Jenaya let me know
that she's gonna be sending me stuff
some so I was pretty excited about that
so I have the lashes on my eyes as well
right now I have the style rise and
grind on their bold face makeup they
have lashes right now they have two
different collections that you can shop
from the bold collection and then also
the clay on the collection these lashes
are in the bold collection and they are
875 pearl ash which I can't repair lash
pair you get to you know but I think
that's a really great price I think that
is very affordable so that's awesome
they are also a cruelty free brand which
i think is fantastic and of course they
will be linked down below so one of the
first things that I notice about the
lashes that I don't particularly love is
simply the way that they feel and this
is gonna sound really weird but I love
lashes I wear lashes a lot and I know my
preferences and when I feel these they
kind of feel like crunchy and I know
right away that those aren't necessarily
my favorites like I don't know how to
explain the type of lashes that I like
but they don't have this kind of like
crunch feel to them they're just kind of
softer and I feel like they look more
natural on the eyes this style is
definitely not a natural style this is
definitely very bold but just the way
that they feel I was like oh I'm not
sure I'm going to fall in love with
these the band is also very thin which
is a good thing I prefer thinner bands
because I feel like they're easier to
blend in to your actual lashes instead
of having a really thick band that just
kind of like looks awkward if you have
smaller eyes or hooded eyes a lot of
times lashes with really thick bands are
not going to look natural on you at all
so I like that it has a thinner band
because I also don't need to use a liner
to feel like it does look more natural
on the lash line but the band is also
really thin which does have its
downsides as well because sometimes it
can be really hard to apply lash glue to
something that has such a thin band
because the lash glue can kind of like
slip off of the band if that makes sense
and I kind of noticed that with this one
and then also they're just not the
easiest for me to apply and I apply
lashes almost every single day so when I
kind of struggle with lashes it
definitely bumps me out and again well I
I I like the band and I like that it's
thin I think it's almost a little bit
too thin for me like I need to have that
kind of like really find balance between
a thick band and a thin band and this
one is just a little bit too much on the
thin side I will say though like the
first time I applied it I really
struggled I think I had to take them off
and put it back on like two or three
times and I was just like I'm not sure
about this it's definitely gotten easier
than the more that I've worn this pair
of lashes and that can be that way with
a lot of lashes so if you get a new pair
of lashes and you put them on and you
struggle don't immediately write them
off because sometimes you actually need
like you need to like beat up your
lashes a little bit and like show them
who's boss
and then they will apply easier for you
so that's that's a tip that I have
because sometimes I'm pretty sharp so in
that past videos as well sometimes you
just need to apply lashes for a while
and it'll get easier for you and I
noticed that with this one so do them
that they are nice and lightweight once
I get them on so that's a good thing I
like to have lashes that have more of
that thin lightweight band where after a
couple hours like my eyes don't feel too
heavy and they're not irritated or
things like that because I do have
sensitive eyes a lot of different
factors can powder my eyes so I need a
pair of lashes that are more lightweight
and I think that these are again this
style is very very bold and not usually
as bold as I am with my lashes really
want to try another pair of the bold
face eyelashes I'm something that I feel
like maybe would be a little bit more
natural when it comes to lashes I know
my lifestyle isn't necessarily natural
but it's also not super super bold so I
want to try out one of those pairs and
see how I would fare again I I think
these lashes are good and I like them
and especially for nine dollars for
lashes I think that that's a really good
deal and I will definitely give it
another try I just can't say that they
became my absolute favorite right off
the bat or something that I continually
reach for just because they're just a
little bit hard for me to apply I need
to kind of work with that band and like
this one I feel like has given me a lot
of problems so if you've noticed this
lashes looking a little wonky
I have to take this one off and try to
reapply it again and I still
like it was kind of giving me some
issues so that's just kind of the
downfalls for me but at the same time
they're nice and lightweight I like that
they do have a thinner band and of
course they're an indie brand a
cruelty-free brand and they have really
affordable prices you have tried a pair
and if you would know something maybe
similar to like the pure diva lashes or
something like that and that you've
tried from both days let me know because
those would be the ones that I would
purchase but like I said I like them I
just don't love them but I think that
they're pretty darn good especially for
such an affordable price tag so that is
what I feel about these lashes are from
full face makeup let me know if you have
tried these down below some of your
favorite styles but other than that
that's going to do it for today's indie
review wrap up okay so that is
everything for today's video talking
