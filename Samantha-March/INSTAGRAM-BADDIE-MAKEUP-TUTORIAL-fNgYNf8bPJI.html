doing the Instagram daddy video so I
started seeing these come out like a
while ago like a while ago I can
remember seeing people start to come out
these and I don't know things i started
in like good humor kind of like poking
fun maybe at people who are doing a lot
of Instagram makeup tutorials because it
seemed like the Instagram tutorials that
were getting a lot of attention were
kind of like over-the-top like having
all these trends put into one video so
people started actually than creating
them on YouTube and I thought it was
interesting to watch I had a fun time
watching them but I never really thought
I would do it myself and then very
recently probably with some like the
past three or four weeks i have started
doing more makeup tutorials on my
instagram if you don't follow me on
instagram yet I'm March beauty words and
will be linked in the description box
below but I just wanted to do something
different with my Instagram I was trying
to figure out what to do and you know
don't do a lot of makeup tutorials on
youtube because I don't feel completely
confident yet especially when it comes
to like explaining things and like
breaking things down because I'm not a
makeup artist I'm just someone who
really enjoys makeup so doing makeup
tutorials old like made me a little bit
nervous but I found when I was doing for
Instagram you know I'm not walking
anybody through the process it's
literally a one-minute video of me doing
my makeup and I found that it was
actually a lot easier to do is just when
I was going to sit down and do my makeup
I would just turn the camera on and do
it and of course you know you started to
see the certain trends that would become
more popular and especially when it
comes to like baking and contour
worrying and really just a lot dealing
with like your face makeup those were
the most and still are the most popular
videos that I post and so it's been kind
of in my head for a while as these
videos are doing well on Instagram I've
been thinking about you know kind of
movie thrown out this Instagram batty
video just for the fun of it and then I
got a package in the mail from sigma
beauty they sent me this really cute
beauty delivery box and inside was their
new baking and strobing brushes so sigma
beauty just came out with five brushes
and they are all geared towards baking
and strobing and I thought what better
time to do the Instagram batty youtube
video then when i get the baking and
strobing brushes because like i said
that's like the videos for me that tend
to get like the most views and likes and
comments is what I'm focusing on my face
when I'm focusing on contour and baking
and highlighting and all that good stuff
so I thought this would be a really
perfect time I have not used these
brushes yet so I'm really excited to try
them so you'll be getting my first
impressions of them I'll go over each
brush and kind of you know what it all
does and I'm just really really excited
and still grateful for sigma beauty for
sending me these brushes i'm so excited
to try them out i am an affiliate with
sigma so i will leave a link down below
if you are interested in getting the
baking and strobing sets or anything
else that i might use from sigma those
will be affiliate links i don't have
like a discount code or anything with
sigma yet but you know if you guys do
want to purchase anything from sigma and
you use my links it will get checked
back to me and maybe someday in the near
future i could even get my own discount
code because that would be awesome but
today we're going to do an Instagram
batty makeup look makeup tutorial using
the baking and scrubbing brushes from
sigma beauty i'm super excited about it
we're all ready to go let's go ahead and
hop into the look i do already have my
face primed typically in my videos and
don't show me putting primer on because
i feel like it's kind of a boring step
but i'm going to come in with my
foundation first so today i'm going to
use the clinic beyond perfecting
foundation and concealer i'm just going
to make a few stripes all over my face
and then I'm going to blend that in with
my Sigma 3d kabuki brush
so next I'm going to apply some
concealer I'm going to use the tart
shape tape concealer oh this concealer
is friggin bomb I just got it not too
long ago and I have been obsessed with
it like what I'm going to make the
Instagram tutorials I'm like you really
need to stop just using the shape tape
concealer like you gotta use something
else too so usually when I'm filming for
Instagram I'll you know try to make the
concealer pretty well known so you can
see it so I go all along the under eye
some people make like crazy shapes I
honestly like I typically go in with
like the thought of like I'm gonna make
cool shapes with my concealer and then I
just go right and I'm like oops forgot
again mostly going to apply at center my
forehead the on the bridge of my nose my
Cupid's bow and then also my chin and
then I am going to take the Sigma this
is the f 79 so this is the concealer
blend kabuki it reminds me of the morphe
g2 which is like one of my favorite ones
for this use here so i'm going to go
ahead and try the sigma 1 also like once
I get the concealer pretty blend it out
on my face I will come in as well and
like put a little bit on my eyes to act
as my eye shadow primer typically for
the looks that I film for Instagram I do
the face first and then I keep the eyes
really simple because I feel like it's
harder to do an in-depth I look tutorial
on Instagram when you only have the one
minute time frame so that's why I tend
to keep the eyes more simple that the
days that I'm doing the Instagram videos
and I focus more on the face and the
baking and the contouring and then I
typically keep it simple with the eyes
and sometimes I'll do lashes sometimes I
won't even do lashes so that's why I'm
starting with the face today if I'm
working with like glitter or dark
shadows or anything like that I attended
to do my eyes first that way if there's
like fallout or I need to clean up
anything will take a makeup wipe then I
haven't done my face makeup yet so just
a foreshadowing of what's coming with
eyes this brush was super easy to work
with I think it's actually smaller than
the more Fiji too but it's really simple
to get right up under the under eyes
it's blending everything out really well
everything looks really nice i like this
brush I thought like out of all of them
I was like I feel like I'm really going
to like this brush because i love i love
my g2 I love brushes like this that are
used for blending out the concealer I
don't know why i don't know if that's
weird but so far with this brush so good
next we have to make the face so I'm
going to use my laura mercier secret
brightening powder so i'm going to use
the baked kabuki it's the f-89 brush so
it's got a little bit of a tilt here so
i'm just going to dip that into the
secret brightening powder and then apply
it to areas where i put the concealer
kind of go a little hard with this
because you know got to make sure
everyone can see that work bacon
so to be honest I don't know if I love
this brush for baking because it has
just like so much like kick up of the
product does I feel like I'm drawing
myself and secret brightening powder
right now and done my contour yet but
I'm going to bake like we're underneath
my contour would be I'm someone who
tends to bring my contour too low but
it's not good baking kind of helps clean
it up so I'm going to do it now and then
let it sit while I do the contour
yeah so not sure this would be my
favorite brush for the powder part of it
but I mean you could use this for other
functions as well this one probably
won't be like my new applying my baking
powder with it my baking powder it
sounds funny but but yeah I'm sure
there's other things that I can use this
for as well I like that has the slant to
it too just not the best for my powder
for baking you let it sit for you know
five ten minutes whatever it is that you
want to do so usually while it's sitting
I will apply it my contour so I'm going
to use the pier cameo contour stick so
it is dual side it has highlight at one
end contour on the other honestly I've
been really gravitating towards this
contour I do like the highlight though I
just like the tart shape tape one better
right now but sometimes I'll use both
sides as well but I really do like the
contour I like the cream contour I did
AI think this was in my first
impressions video I think and I didn't
love it so I've been playing with it
more you know just trying to like see
what I would like it for and I actually
have ended up really liking it so that
was another reason why I wanted to use
it was it tell you guys that I do like
it I think it's good for a more natural
contour I've tried using more of it and
it definitely you know enhances features
more but for a nice natural light cream
contour I think it looks really nice so
I haven't gravitating towards this quite
a bit it's really easy to use easy to
get the product out easy to blend so I
want it to be able to come in and give
you guys an update on that so for
contour I start like kind of right above
where my ear is and i will just draw the
line down and i try to like curve it
towards my cheekbone like sometimes i
tend to go like straight down and then
that brings the contour down too far and
the point of contouring is to give us
cheekbones to make us look more lift it
so that's why i will do like the baking
underneath as well to try to help clean
that up if need it i'll go ahead and do
the same blend it out i'm going to try
to use the p89 this is the baked
precision brush this brush i was
thinking about using for the powder but
I worried that it might be too small
especially for under my under eyes
I was like what could i use this for
like I want to use each brush but in a
different setting I'm going to try to
see how it blends out contour I don't
know how well this will go over but I
want to try it really I didn't come to
her my forehead so I would be so
embarrassing if I didn't do that so I'm
just going to go ahead and grab my cameo
contour stick again and just draw some
lines up and there okay so I'm just
going to see how this the lens out
I don't know I haven't seen like what
other people are all using these brushes
floor like some I feel like are pretty
obvious some I feel like could have like
multiple uses this one I just really
wanted to see I think that worked pretty
well right I mean it's not all the way
blend it yet so don't mind the harsh
line but yeah I think that's working
pretty well as a contour so just go
ahead and blend that a little bit I
don't mind the small brush for
contouring because there's not like as
large of areas for this part so the
smaller brush seems to work just fine
for me so yeah I'm really liking it
typically in my tutorials like i'll use
the beauty blender for this part but
this brush seems to be working just fine
and then i'm going to go into the Cameo
contour and i'm gonna like flip it so
you see this brush and it's like angles
as well i'm just going to put a little
bit on the long angle with the brush and
use it to contour my nose and see with
the small brush like this it really does
help with contouring the nose so that's
actually really cool and I'll just kind
of flip it again and blend it out no
that was easy I'm not like huge into
nose contouring it I don't hate my nose
at this very moment but I do i do a
little bit to set the contour and kind
of bronze up the skin a little bit i'm
going to use the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer and my morphe m530 I do
all this while my baking putters on it's
taking me a little bit longer right now
just because I'm talking but usually
it's probably about five minutes that I
have the baking powder on and I feel
like doing the like bronzing powder as
well and a set the contour like if you
still do have any like harsh lines from
the contour like I thought this that
kind of was using the bronzer can kind
of help blend it in a little bit as well
then I'm going to dust the powder away
i'm going to use the f 06 this is the
powder sweep from the sigma collection
all of the excess powder
I wanted to use this one to sweep away
the powder because I feel like the name
was telling me that that's what it wants
to do but I feel like you can even use
this for bronzer too because it's so
small or you could use it for a contour
as well but i just wanted to use it for
the sweep right now but i will
definitely be having like multiple uses
for this one I think you could as well
and typically what I will do next is I
will jump over into my eyes and then I
finished the eyes and I do like blush
and lips last eyes I try to get nice and
zoomed in so you can see what I'm doing
so today I'm going to be 0 using the BH
Cosmetics and carli bybel pellet what it
looks like ok so like I said I keep the
eye looks really simple and basic so
first I'm going to come in with my Sigma
e25 blending brush yup this color right
here from the top it's the third one in
from the top and I'm just going to sweep
this on to the crease
once that's done I'm going to pick up my
Sigma medium sweeper it is an e 50 for
then I'm going to grab this first shade
right there and I'm going to sweep that
all over the lid like I said really easy
I look nothing too crazy here today
and I'm going to go back with my e 25
and just make sure everything is blended
out so for a liner is sometimes I'll do
liner on camera sometimes I won't it
usually just depends on how overheated
my camera is to be completely honest
with you of if I decide to include liner
on that I know that it's about to
overheat so I'm not going to do liner
and this one and it's probably best
time-wise that I don't because it can
take me a while but I'm going to use the
Sigma wicket gel liner I'd about this
liner all the time I absolutely love it
and I use the sigma e 06 brush it's a
really tiny precise brush I think it
really helps get the wing so I'm going
to do my liner off camera and i will
probably apply some lashes off camera as
well again in the interest of saving
time I don't usually apply lashes in my
Instagram tutorials either like
sometimes I'll do like something fun
like oh no lashes Oh lashes you know
sometimes they'll do that but usually I
don't apply it on camera it simply
because it takes so much time and I have
a camera that overheats very frequently
so BRD to finish off the eyes I'm going
to come in with my color pop get paid
liner it's like a metallic rose gold I'm
going to put this in the water lines
pick up my morphe 36 brush and I'm going
to take the first shadow that I place
down and i'm just going to sweep that
along the lower lash line
then I'm going to grab my benefit roller
lash mascara and use that for the bottom
lashes don't typically do my brows on
camera again just because it takes a
while and if I am going to do anything
with browse I will typically do just a
brow video for Instagram but today I'm
just going to put on a little bit of
brow drama it's just a tinted brow gel
from Maybelline I'm mostly because i'm
getting my eyebrows waxed after i filmed
this video so I'm going to have to take
it off anyways so I didn't wanted to be
like do anything super wild and crazy
with my brows since I have to be
removing it right away but let me tell
you I'm really excited to get my brows
waxed because it's been a long time
coming but I do really like this brow
gel from Maybelline it's tinted it kind
of helps fill everything in and it's all
so quick and affordable if my brows are
so unruly I've been waiting for this day
for so long then to finish up my face
I'm going to use the Sigma corps de rosa
or powder for my blush and my morphe for
i love this blush it is still pigmented
I talked about it in my underrated
makeup products video and I think it is
amazing so for highlights everybody
loves the Becca cosmetics and jaclyn
hill champagne face glow palette so i'm
going to be using Prosecco pop out of
the palette for highlights i'm going to
use the strobing fan it's the f40 to
this is the last brush and the kit that
i'll be using and i used all of them so
obviously it's a little fan brush
perfect for highlight so i'm just going
to pop a little bit of that on to the
high points of my cheekbones I don't use
fan brushes a whole ton for highlighting
I just don't feel like they give like
the same effect as what do I usually use
the morphe em 501 but I know the fan
brushes are becoming more popular to
highlight with and I mean this one is
nice it's doing a nice job it's doing
what it should be doing I just am NOT a
huge fan of the and brushes
but I like this one it's working just
fine I like this a little bit smaller
too because you can actually like place
the highlight where you want to place it
it's like some of my fan brushes are so
cute and I just feel like it kind of
like takes the highlight everywhere so I
like that this one is smaller and then
for the lips everybody on Instagram
loves Kylie cosmetics so I'm going to be
using the candy k liquid lipstick I
really do like the formulas of these
liquid lipsticks are super long-lasting
and I love this pink color so I usually
zoom in real close on my lips to apply
the lipstick
alright guys and this is going to be the
completed look for my Instagram body a
makeup tutorial makeup look what did you
guys think I hope that you enjoyed this
video and I just thought it would be the
perfect opportunity to share my new
Sigma baking and strobing brushes I
didn't want to point out this isn't a
sponsored video Sigma just sent me these
brushes and said you know use them if
you want to review him if you want to
and I really did want to try them out so
it's not sponsored or like in
collaboration with sigma beauty or
anything like that but i tried to use as
many sigma products as I could because
Sigma is truly one of my favorite brands
if you watch my instagram tutorials you
are seeing a lot of these brushes and
other makeup products from sigma turd in
those tutorials because I do love them
everything will be linked down below
again because I am an affiliate with
Sigma if you do use my link to purchase
anything with sigma i will get a little
kickback from it and hopefully be on my
way to getting my own discount code with
sigma that would be so awesome i really
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
and enjoyed seeing the brushes had to
pick my favorite brushes i really loved
the f 79 the concealer brush I feel like
we're really going to get along I also
really did like the p89 I use this to
blend out my contour but I think I can
also use it to bake and I will really
like it and I feel like you could even
use it under the under eyes so I have a
feeling I'm really going to love the p
89 and also if I had to pick like
another favorite one I would do the F 06
the powder sweet because I feel like
you'll be able to use this for a lot of
things as well sweeping off the powder
which is always an important job for
your Instagram tutorial videos but also
like contour as well so those are
probably my three brushes but i love
this said if you love baking and
strobing and all of that good stuff
definitely a set to check out because
really impressed with these I can't wait
to use them more those three were
probably my three favorite brushes if I
had to choose favorites from the
collection but really happy with this
really thankful for Sigma to sending me
these and I really hope that you guys
enjoyed the look that I came up with
using these brushes do get a lot of
questions on how I film my Instagram
videos I do my Instagram videos the
exact same way that I do my youtube
videos I film with the sony a 5100 i
edit videos on wondershare Phil Morris 0
for the Instagram tutorials I do the
exact same thing that I'm doing on
YouTube same camera same editing same
everything I just make them
really really short so i can leave links
for those down below as well if you're
interested but that's like probably one
of my most asked questions lately is how
do I make those tutorials so I wanted to
pop that in here as well since I am
talking about Instagram tutorials in
this video but I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this video if you did
