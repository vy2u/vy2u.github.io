today's video I'm going to be taking on
the Instagram vs real life makeup
challenge that I've see
floating around doing one side of my
face as my everyday makeup and the other
side as my Instagram makeup so first I'm
going to prime my face like normal for
both sides just using my Milani prime
shield and then for foundation I'm going
to grab my Maybelline better skin
foundation and the more feet m for 39
and apply that to one side of my face I
first saw this video done by layla rose
so i will leave her video link down
below I've seen a few others from since
then but she was the first one that I
saw so I will leave her link down below
and then on the Instagram side i'm using
my Anastasia Beverly Hills stick
foundation in natural in a beauty sponge
from a peeler cosmetics everybody loves
a pH and everybody loves the Beauty
Blender on Instagram so that's why I
chose those and then going on to
concealer I do like to use concealer
every day I like that it hides dark
circles and then it really brightens up
the under eyes so I'm going the tart
rainforest of the sea concealer and then
my Sigma of 79 to blend that out and I
also bring the concealer on to my eyelid
as my eyeshadow primer and then I do
need to set that every day as well make
sure everything stays in place there are
no creases but I also like that the
powders can help brighten up the under
eye again so I grabbed my rebel and stay
matte and using my deluxe concealer
brush from Real Techniques to set that
and also the eyelid as well for the
Instagram side I chose the tart shape
tape because everybody has lost their
mind over this concealer I'm just
applying it more heavily over here and
then normally I would apply concealer to
the center of my face to highlight but I
just went with my forehead and my chin
for this one I left out my nose and my
Cupid's bow just to kind of help balance
it out since i'm not doing both sides of
the face type of thing a little confused
at this one but that's what I went with
and of course we have to bake for
Instagram so use my Maybelline setting
powder and for every day I do like to
bronze up the skin I just like the way
that it looks so i'm using my physicians
formula butter bronzer and the more feet
m530 but on the Instagram side of course
we need to use some cream contour so I
grabbed out my cambial contour stick
from pierre cosmetics and then blending
in with the pier sponge and then I'll
set that with my too faced chocolate
soleil bronzer I use that to set the
contour and then also bronze up the face
as well again using the morphe m530 and
just going a little bit harder on this
side so you can really really see it in
those Instagram videos and then I've
gotta dust away that powder using the
morphe III and then moving on to the
eyes i'm going to use both looks with
the tart and styled by her rouge palette
so for the first time going to grab my
morphe emma 433 grab a little bit of
pinch and place that into the crease and
then picking up my sigma e 54 and the
shade smitten and just placing that all
over the lid and then blending the two
together and then for the Instagram side
i'll pick up the morphe m4 33 in the
shade vamp and place this into the
crease and then kind of extend it along
the eye as well and then picking up the
sigma e25 and the shade Kitty and
placing that right into the outer V to
kind of darken up the look and then
again I'll pick up the sigma e 54 and
the shade bliss and I'll place that
right into the inner part of my eyes
just to kind of brighten the whole look
up leaving the outer V and everything
alone so those shadows can do their own
thing this is just to kind of give a pop
to the inner part of the eye and then of
course we have to blend that all
together because harsh lines would just
be you know one of the most embarrassing
things to have on Instagram I mean am i
right and then for every day no no I do
not do a winged liner every day it's
very time consuming oh man yep nope but
for Instagram of course we have to do
the winged liner some creating the wing
using my Maybelline master precise a
liner and then for every day I typically
use like a nude or a beige eyeliner for
the waterline this one is in the nude
from Rimmel and I'll use more like a
brown or black on the Instagram side
this one is from Maybelline in their
skinny pencil in brown and then for a
real life I'll grab my morphe oh I think
it's like the e39 I'll have all these
linked down below but I'll grab a little
bit of vamp and sweep that onto the
lower lash
line and then a little bit of smitten on
the same brush for an inner corner
highlight and then on the Instagram side
out place kitty on that morphe brush and
then just really smoke out the lower
lash line and then grabbing a bit of
bliss for the inner corner highlight
over here and then for mascara for both
I'm going to use the Max Factor precise
mascara for real life I do not mess
around with lashes on an everyday basis
so i usually do about two coats of
mascara but for the Instagram side I'll
just do a quick coat and mostly just
prepping my lashes for the false lashes
that i'll be using because of course you
gotta use the falsies on instagram and
the lashes that i chose our heartbreaker
from house of lashes and then for blush
I'm just going to use the brush from the
palette and cheeky and my morphe for i'm
just using a much lighter hand for the
real life side and then just going ham
on the Instagram side gotta make sure
that you see that blush thank you so
much and then for brows no no no under
everyday basis I'm not messin with my
brows because I just don't care about
bras that much if you've watched six
reasons why i'm a bad beauty vlogger i
talk more about browse but no i cannot
be messing with my brows on a daily
basis it's very time-consuming and I
don't feel like I'm not great at them
anyway but for Instagram I at least have
to give it somewhat of a shot so I will
use my benefit goof proof brownsell and
try to do my brows the best that I can
for highlight I'm going to use my morphe
m5a1 brush and champagne pop from becca
and jaclyn hill and again just using a
lighter hand on the everyday side i do
like to highlight but for instagram like
I really tried to be glowing and again
like with the concealer I skipped over
my center of my nose and then the
Cupid's bow as well and I just placed a
little bit on the tip of my nose to try
to help balance out the challenge here
and then for lips on everyday side I'm
grabbing Abu Dhabi from NYX and they're
soft matte lip cream it's just a really
nice nude one of my favorite nudes such
a staple color not doing any / lining or
anything crazy like that and then on the
Instagram side I'm grabbing Ashton from
Anastasia Beverly Hills really nice a
liquid lipstick everybody loves a bh
overrun instagram and i will over line
the top lip just a little bit but then
once my lips are complete this is going
to be the end of the Instagram vs real
life makeup what did you guys think let
