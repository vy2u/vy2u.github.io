today's video is going to be an about me
video it is also like a big tag video
collaboration video and I'm really
excited to be doing this because it's
going to be my first like big
collaboration video with other members
from Ipsy OS if you aren't familiar with
F cos is a group for like beauty
bloggers and influencers where we can
you know chat with each other bounce
ideas off each other asked questions
about each other and it was created by
Michelle Phan who is the creator of ypsi
as well it's why it's called the TOS
which stands for if C open studios it's
a really great group it's been really
helpful for me especially for like
asking questions or you know we get to
do these collab videos but it's just
really helped me meet more people who do
kind of those same things that I do and
that's been such a really great
experience they do offer a lot of other
things like being able to actually film
at the Ipsy studios I live in Iowa
that's in LA obviously I'm probably
never going to have the chance to be
able to do that but for people who live
in the LA area they also get a lot of
other really fantastic benefits so
that's super cool for them I'll probably
never be able to take part of that
because a lot of times for the events
and things that they do you get like a
day's notice and obviously that's not
going to work but that definitely wasn't
even a part of my thinking when I got
asked to join the group it was to have
the support of all of these other beauty
bloggers and it's just been a really
amazing experience so far so I know that
they've done a few of these other like
bigger collab videos and this is the
first one that I'm going to be doing I
think we have a list of 20 questions
that everyone will be answering I will
try to link as many different channels
down below as I can it just kind of
depends on who all gets their links up
before i put this video up so i will try
to link as many of the other F cos
members who are doing this tag down
below as well and it is a tag video so
if you want to do the about me tag that
we started over here please do feel free
there just 20 questions they don't look
too difficult so without further ado I
don't we just happen two big questions
is how old are you I just turned 29 and
a half and half shin number two where
are you from i was born in
açelya California I live in Des Moines
Iowa now but previously from living in
Des Moines I lived in Dubuque Iowa
number three is do you have a nickname
that people call you I don't think so
right now in high school I got called
spam because like my really good friends
the sister her name was also Samantha
and that was like a way to tell us apart
people called me spam I'm really not
sure why but I don't really have a
nickname right now question number four
is what's your favorite season summer
mission number five is who is your
celebrity or youtube crush my celebrity
crushes are clay matthews from the green
bay packers and Chris Brian from the
Chicago Cubs hands down no question
youtube crush I mean that would be just
like tons of girl crushes so like Lester
loves Amanda and sing Jackson Hill Babs
beauty carli bybel desi Perkins you know
number six is what you do for work I am
a published author I have four novels
and I have a fifth one set to come out
before the end of this year if you're
interested in any of my books I always
do leave my amazon links down below in
case you might rip them out number seven
is do you have any pets and yes I have
one dog she is a villa and her name is
Ares 4 8 is what is your biggest pet
peeve I don't know my biggest pet peeve
I don't know if this is necessarily a
pet peeve but it's just like negativity
I just cannot stand negativity number
nine is what is the most you've spent in
one makeup shopping trip I don't know
for sure it's probably it has something
to do with the Sephora vib sale because
those always make me go a little crazy
but probably just like a couple hundred
dollars i don't feel like I've ever gone
super crazy on a makeup shopping trip
thanks so i would say probably a couple
hundred dollars i do my final answer
tenes do you prefer high end makeup or
drugstore makeup honestly it kind of
depends for like my face like
foundations and concealers and things
like that I tend to gravitate more
towards drugstore but for like I shadow
palettes and like mascaras I tend to go
for high-end number 11 is when did you
start wearing makeup I mean I
started like experimenting and trying
make up probably when I was like eight
nine ten years old my mom's makeup my
grandma's makeup it didn't matter i was
in dec Rollins my coat 12 is what do you
love or hate and/or hate about makeup
what I love about it is that it's just a
way to express creativity and for me
it's just kind of like an outlet for
creativity and a one that I never really
thought I would have because I'm not
necessarily a creative person
artistically wise i'm terrible at art
drawing painting creating visually is
really really hard for me I'm better at
like putting actual words to paper with
my writing career that's where my
creativity is I've never really had it
artistically so be able to find an
outlet and to be able to understand that
I can be creative artistically as well
when it comes to makeup that's been
something that's really really inspired
me and that I thought was really
exciting the hate about makeup is the
stigma that if you are interested in
makeup and beauty that all of a sudden
you are not smart anymore I don't
understand that Sigma it's been
something that I've been dealing with
for a very long time especially with
balancing books and beauty and just the
the stigma that comes from that I don't
understand it and I but I really feel
like YouTube is helping change that
number 13 is the size beauty like what
else are you passionate about obviously
writing I love books it is my career my
full-time job it's what I absolutely
love doing I love writing and I love
reading I do also really enjoy like
dance yoga fitness those are other my
other really big passions as well we're
14 is if you are upset or unmotivated
how do you feel better honestly a lot of
times I turn to dance or to music when I
was in college and I would have
roommates we're like I couldn't just
turn the music up and like have a dance
session I truly would just get into my
car and drive around for like an hour
listening to my favorite songs and I
would really help improve my mood and
now like when I'm feeling down or
uninspired I'll just like pop headphones
in and dance for like a solid hour like
not only is it a good workout but it
just helps lift my spirits as well so I
just I love music 15 is if you had a
week to travel
all expenses were paid where would you
go I have always said that Italy is at
the very top of my to travel list I
really really hope to make it there
someday so if someone was going to offer
me an all-expense-paid trip I'm gonna
choose Italy number 16 is why and when
did you start YouTube I actually I'm
going to be putting out a video if it's
not already up it's already been filmed
but if it's not already going up i do
have a whole video kind of explaining
why it is the challenges with starting
YouTube and just a very honest look at
why i started youtube and why i actually
restarted and relaunched youtube
throughout the year so if that video is
up i will leave a link down below if
it's not up it is coming up soon so
hopefully you will subscribe and stick
around so you can get notified when that
video goes up because it's a video that
I'm really proud of and just a very like
raw real honest video but to kind of
like put it in a nutshell I guess one of
the biggest reasons that i started
youtube was to be able to connect with
people who are like-minded like me and
interested and passionate about the same
things as me which is also a really
great thing about joining something like
it cos and just being able to talk on a
daily basis and you know to celebrate
milestones and things like that with
people who understand why it's so
important because i don't have a lot of
that in my real life so to be able to
have that virtually and you know just
make even more friends in this community
is really awesome and i started youtube
I relaunched this channel in May of this
year but I started this channel back the
summer of 2015 was when it started and I
relaunched it as a beauty channel in may
2016 just 17 is what advice would you
give for someone starting a channel my
advice would be to just start it and try
it my advice would also be not to go out
and worry about buying all this fancy
equipment and editing and everything
like that I would say you know record
five videos use your phone use the
YouTube video editor do everything for
free and see if it's something that
drives you and motivates you and
something that you actually like doing I
have talked to people before who said
you know I thought I would really want
to
youtube channel and i realized i don't
like talking to the camera i I don't
feel comfortable doing it and you know
some people don't some people really
hated editing and it just made it not
fun for them to do YouTube and that's
okay I mean I have thought that I'm
passionate in a lot of different things
and I've tried them and but like you
know what I actually didn't like that so
my advice would be before you invest
financially or you know really put a lot
of time into something try it out get
your feet wet make sure it's something
that you want to do and then if it is
figure out ways to grow an 18 is what
are you trying to achieve with your
channel first I want to achieve making
lots of friends because like I said like
this is the reason why i started youtube
was to keep finding people who think the
same way that I do because it really
helps you in not feeling so different
because that's also what I talk about in
my like why i started youtube video
that's coming up is just always feeling
different from everybody so the more
friends that I make and the more but my
daily routine changes and I'm able to
talk to so many different people about
so many different things it just really
really helps love to be able to write a
book one day on you know about starting
YouTube and kind of the behind the
scenes of it and my experiences with it
but just growing and seeing where I can
go I mean truly youtube I feel like it's
changing the game for you know not only
so many people but makeup brands in
general and I think that is really
amazing so truly I mean who knows where
it could go as long as you keep working
hard at it and putting your all into it
it's it's a who knows where it will go
game number 19 is who are what inspires
you the most and I always think it's
inspiring to watch YouTube I mean to be
honest I don't really watch TV or watch
movies or things like that i'm almost
always on youtube and I get inspired to
it by so many different people that are
on here and hearing their stories and
what they've overcome and it's the same
way when it goes back to my book world
it's also really inspiring to read a
book and then see in the acknowledgments
or maybe I interview the author and she
says well this in the book stemmed from
my life or this stemmed from my life and
this is how I got over the obstacles and
I did
think that's what's really inspiring and
motivating and I just feel like it's
interesting because a lot of people that
you see on youtube and even a lot of
authors that i know i mean it even goes
out to celebrities as well a lot of
times we push ourselves and to motivate
ourselves so much but we're doing it
because you know we're trying to make
our lives better from what it is only
have not been handed anything in my life
and I've had to work incredibly hard for
every everything that I have achieved so
and I feel like there's a lot of other
people that aren't the same boat as I am
so those are the stories that really do
inspire me the last question question 20
is what advice would you give your
younger self I feel like definitely the
advice that I would give my younger self
is to follow my own path and to not let
anyone else kind of knock me off that
path again this refers to the why i
started youtube video and how many times
that i let you know like virtual
bullying and online bullying kind of
bring me down and you know try to
rearrange in the path for me when it
wasn't what i wanted to be on because i
was dealing with so much negativity and
you know hurtful comments and things
like that and the advice that I would
give myself is to not give up and what I
want to really be doing and you know a
lot of people have tried to bring me
down even when it comes to books and you
know tell me that I'm not good enough or
you know writing books is not a real job
or real career or anything like that and
I finally learned to not listen to
anyone else and to only listen to me and
do what I want to continue to do but if
I had to give them advice to my younger
self I would definitely be telling
myself that because I let myself get
knocked down too many times but i'm
standin right now gonna be it for the if
cos about me tag i will list all the
questions down below if you are
interested in doing the tag yourself
because hey why not why not do it i
haven't done it about me in a very long
time i can't really think of the last
about me that i did but i think it's
been a while so hopefully this was fun
for you to watch maybe get to know me a
little bit better again i will try to
leave as many of the other F cos members
I do this
video down below if you want to check
out their channels and say hi or let
them know that I sent you that would be
awesome again this was just a really fun
video to collaborate with a few other of
the f CEOs members I was really excited
to get in on this video so thank you so
much for having me this was a lot of fun
please do give this video a thumbs up if
you did enjoy it make sure you are
subscribed before you go and I will get
you real soon in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
