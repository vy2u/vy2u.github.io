today's video I'm going to be talking
about my hair extensions which I do not
have it yet because I'm going to also be
putting them in this video but I
recently was sent some hair extensions
and I've been wearing them for about two
or three weeks now I've worn them in a
couple videos I mentioned them I've
talked about them on my snapchat and
Instagram so I wanted to share a video
going over the extensions I'm giving my
kind of review and thoughts on them and
then also just doing a quick demo of how
I put them in my hair so that's what
today's video is going to be so I was
contacted by the brand irresistible me
and they asked me if they could send me
some hair extensions and I said yes and
that made me so excited so this is what
the box looks like from irresistible me
so I was super super pumped to get that
email because I have always been
obsessed with hair extensions I've
always been obsessed with like super
long hair
I've only cut my hair two times in the
past probably ten years that I can
recall and each time that I cut my hair
short I cried and it was like the worst
day of my life I really never know what
I'm thinking when I decided to cut my
hair but other than that like I love
long hair but I have a really really
been like super thin hair and it doesn't
really grow past this length which I
mean it's it's long but it's so thin
that it's just mmm I just never really
loved it but it doesn't typically grow
past this length this is where it stops
growing and I just always loved a long
hair when I was getting ready to
graduate from high school and my mom was
asking me what I wanted my like high
school graduation gift to be I said hair
extensions so that's like how badly I
want a hair extensions I ended up
changing my mind and I asked for a party
with a slip and slide instead so that's
what I got cuz I'm a child
and that's okay I just was really
excited to get this because I've been
really wanting hair extensions I just
think they allow what allow me to do so
much more with my hair it's really hard
to braid my hair or style my hair with
how thin it is it's constantly like
falling out if I try to like put in
braids or anything my hair falls out of
it because it's too thin it can't it
can't handle it so super excited and a
big thank you to irresistible me for
reaching out and sending me this box so
they did let me
out what extensions I wanted to get and
obviously the color and everything so
I'll have the website listed down below
of course but I chose for myself I chose
the royal remy hair they do have a
couple of different lines each one will
say a little bit about the line and you
know what that hair is you can also
choose your length and then the weight
of your hair and then the prices will
vary on the length and the weight of the
hair that you want so just pay attention
to what it is that you're doing the self
or the royal remy hair you could choose
14 16 18 20 22 and 24 inches so I went
with 22 and the 22 is come in a 200 gram
so the 200 gram is 10 pieces it's one
piece of four clips two pieces of three
clips five pieces of two clips and two
pieces of one clip so that is a lot of
hair but like I said I like a lot of
hair like I wanted the most hair and I
also want it really long hair I decided
to go with 22 that's really long my hair
right now is about 18 or so I decided to
go with 22 because I really do like long
hair like that's what I wanted so that's
that's what I chose but again I'll leave
it on the website down below they have
really great videos out there I watched
their YouTube videos of how to like
match for the best color and all that
sort of thing they have really good
videos on you know what the different
lengths would look like what the
different weights look like so I thought
that was awesome I got my shade in the
Royal golden blonde so when you get it
you would get the Box like this and when
you open it up it comes in a bag like
this so this little part of the bag it
will say open this side first and that
piece is packaged separately to give you
a better look at the shade and length
without opening the full set do not use
it unless certain you want to keep these
extensions please do not clip this piece
in your hair or use any heat or styling
products it must remain a perfect
condition in case of return or exchange
after you've decided on keeping this
side only then should you open it by
removing the seal opening the seal will
void the guarantee and you won't be
eligible for a return or exchange
exchange so it's really important that
when you get hair extensions and most
hair extension companies are this way
they
you a little piece of hair so you can
hold it up and you can test is the color
okay do you think the length is okay
before you bust in and take all of the
extensions and then those extensions you
know wouldn't be able to be given to
someone else
so you've just opened this you slide it
open you would take that piece out so I
just held it up to my head you don't
want to clip it in I just held it up to
my head checked it out I was like yep
color works love the lights okay and
then I opened the big set and then this
is where all of the hair is it also does
come up with a few extra clips as well
an example of some of the clips this is
the four piece clip and I believe that
they said that you can now buy these
separately as well like if you wouldn't
want to buy a full site and you would
just want to buy the four piece you can
do that because this is a ton of hair
like if you want extensions just for
volume I feel like you could definitely
just get this like there are days where
I just wear this in the back of my head
and then I put maybe like a two clip
over here because I do have more hair
over here and a one clip over here and
that's all I wear because this kit does
give you a lot of hair in a lot of
volume so again it's the floor piece so
it just has these little Clips up here
and then they clip easily closed I
didn't have any problems with the clip
except I noticed the first time they
were super easy to open and easy to
place into my hair but I noticed that
when I was trying to open them again to
take out that was a little bit harder
but just on the first time it was almost
like they needed to be open and closed
once or twice and then every time after
that I had no problems using the clips
thought they were super easy so that was
good but again so this is the four piece
so this is what the hair looks like
again like I just thought the color
match was pretty darn good especially
because I have my underneath as darker
and it blended in really well with there
also so I thought my color match was
really spot-on they are also really
helpful in the email like you can email
them questions or have them look at your
Instagram even - that's what I did and
you know inside you know which one do
you think would be the best for me so I
think that's all they'll be really
helpful the customer service I have
found really good so again that is what
the 4 clip looks like and what I loved
about these like the hair is so soft
like I wish my hair felt like these
extensions but they feel super soft they
look shiny
and nice but also natural at the same
time like it doesn't look like fake hair
to me it just looks really nice so again
that is the for clip and then here's an
example of a to clip so you just have
your two clips here this is a lot what
I'll put it like right about here or so
because I have more hair on this side
because I've part on that side I usually
put a to clip in over here so what this
one is a two clip and there's also the
one clip if you need to just find
anywhere that you need one spot like a
lot of times I'll do a one clip over
here as well so that is a what a one
clip looks like for just a few examples
of what the clips look like so with this
hair you can treat it as natural hair I
mean you can use any sort of styling
products in it you can wash them like
normal if you want to you can use heat
on them
I have curled these before they hold
really well with the heat with the curl
like they hold better than my actual
hair does with a curl so yeah you mean
you can just treat them as normal hair
so I thought that was really amazing
I've been wearing these like I said for
about two or three weeks now I have done
braids with them I've curled them I
warned him at ponytails I've worn them
down and I've just been loving on them
so far I'm super happy with them I've
gotten a lot of compliments when I wear
them when I wear them out people are
complimenting me on them when I put them
in photos and getting lots of
compliments on them so I'm really happy
like I said you want to pick the hair
extensions that you want if you have
longer hair but thin here and you just
want volume you don't have to pick 22
inches if your hair is only 18 inches
like mine you can have there's a wide
variety of preference so if you want
extensions just for volume you have 18
inches of hair get 18 inches and then
these will give you some volume if you
want longer hair then you know
definitely get the longer extensions but
I also one thing that I did was I looked
at Beauty vloggers that I know that have
hair extensions and went to their hair
extension videos and saw what different
lengths that they did so like Carli
bybel did one recently and she was like
and these are my 24 inch extensions and
I was like mmm 24 think that's going to
be a little bit too long for me and the
Lester luxe was talking about her
extensions and they were 18 inches and I
was like ooh 18 I think I want to go a
little bit longer so between eight
in 24 I decided to go with the 22 so
that is kind of how I did it so
hopefully that helps you guys out and
then once I clip these in I can also
share some photos in here of what the 20
tubes look like on me but next I'll go
ahead and just show you a quick demo of
how I do apply them I am pretty new with
hair extensions so you know my method
might not be the best yet if anybody has
any tips or tricks let me know I'm
watching a ton of videos trying to learn
how to get better at it of course but
I'll just show you how I do it and how
I've been doing it since I've gotten
these extensions and hopefully a little
demo will help you out but that's kind
of my thoughts and feedback on the
irresistible me I've been super happy
with them I think they look great they
feel great like I said I've gotten lots
of compliments on them the shipping was
very fast I've had no problems with the
customer service my emails are answered
very quickly they were super helpful in
the process of picking out the hair so
yeah I just I thought that was amazing
like I said I'll leave the link down
below I think there's a 20% coupon code
I will put it right here and then it
also be down below it's not an affiliate
code but it's just a discount code if
you want to try them out you can get 20%
off your first order so I'll leave that
down below in case you might be
interested as well but when we go ahead
and jump into the demo so I expect this
to be really difficult because I filmed
by myself and I don't think I've ever
tried you like filming the back of my
head but we're gonna give it a shot so
the first thing that I do is I put in
the four clip and what I'll do is I'll
separate my hair at like from right
behind my ears and then I will just grab
everything up a lot of people use
something fancy like combs and stuff to
separate I don't I don't do that I'm
just gonna be really real with you guys
a lot of people also will tease their
hair I hate teasing my hair I hate it I
don't like to do it I don't even think I
tease my hair correctly if that makes
any sense but it always like looks weird
hate the way it makes my hair feel I
prefer not to tease my hair you can
tease your hair if you want to I
understand that it definitely does help
like blend butter and hide the clips
better but I do just find without
teasing so I just put my hair up with
the hair Club then make sure all of the
clips are
now I'm gonna try to turn around and
show you guys this
okay so that's how I put in the big ol
four clip still then it will look like
this if out such a small amount of hair
in the back there that it really doesn't
bother me it seems to blend pretty
easily for me sometimes what I'll do if
I'm feeling it is I'll take that little
section of hair of my real hair that was
back and I'll tie it up in a little
ponytail and then I will put the
extensions over it I don't do it all the
time because I personally don't think I
need to but if you find that your hair
doesn't blend as well and this typically
will only happen if you are getting
extensions that are quite a few inches
longer than your regular hair it might
not blend as easily obviously because
you're putting hair longer than your own
what you can do is just put it in a
little ponytail and clip those clips
over it and then that will hide your
hair and then usually especially with
the big four clip that little bump from
your hair will not even be noticeable
especially if you have really thin hair
like me it's like a teeny tiny little
bump but that's how I put in the four
clip and then next what I'll do is I'll
just take that hair down and then I'll
just grab another little section I'll
just let some hair down out of that and
then I'll clip that clip I'll tie this
section back up normally here I might do
either a two or three and I know I
haven't shown you the three EXO's and a
different bag upstairs my bathroom but I
went and grabbed it my camera was
getting down overheating so this is what
the three clip looks like so I'm just
gonna layer this right over that last
section so I'll spin around again so you
can see me so make sure you undo the
clips first you can brush it out too
like I brush this like normal with my
hair it's usually when after I take them
out I'll either brush them or before I
put them in the next time I'll just give
them a quick brush and it really helps
liven things up in my opinion but I
brushed them out the last time that I
took them off which it was just a couple
days ago so flip around and show you how
I put into three
so for that section what I did was I
brought the hair down and then where I
clipped it was essentially just a right
on top of that four piece so the clips
are really close together hopefully you
can see it okay I know this is kind of
hard because I'm doing it without a
mirror and doing without looking at
anything so I know this might not be
like the most professional hair
extension clip in video ever of life but
hopefully it is good enough that you
guys understand what it is that I'm
doing and get the gist of it so next
what I do because I part my hair with
more hair over here like I said I
usually do it to clip over here and then
one clip over here but for the one clip
I'll usually just take my finger and go
like that flip this hair up and then
I'll place the extension worried about
on that hairline piece sometimes I'll
clip it over sometimes I'll just try to
make it stay I have a ton of baby hairs
which is super annoying then I'll just
take it and clip that one in like so and
then you can see so this part it can
like the front can be the hardest parts
to blend I think in my opinion
especially because I have layers so the
front of my hair is even shorter than
say like the back of my hair what I'll
do sometimes it depends on what
hairstyle I want to use I definitely
think curling helps blend everything
together but I don't always curl my hair
because I try not to use a lot of heat
on my hair but sometimes I will
especially with the extensions I found
myself curling my hair more because I
really do think that it blends easily
and I like the look of like big curled
hair extensions but like so say for this
part what I'll do sometimes I actually
found this one from Casey Holmes and I
thought it worked out really well is I
just take whatever sections of my real
hair then I want to hide and I'll twist
them up like this and then you can pin
them and then you can pin it in the back
here just take a bobby pin and pin it
right in the back of your head sometimes
I'll do like a braid here and loop it
around my head or I'll just you know
twist it again loop it around you know
just little things like that to help
cover the hair
but again I really do think that curling
it is the best way to make it blend it
easier but the front is definitely the
hardest part to blend so I wanted to
give you a couple of options there and
then for the two clip I'm going to go
ahead and do just what I did on the
other side so take my section of hair
and flip that over
and there we go so the two cliffs are
right in here again same thing with this
side like these are technically actually
my bangs obviously I've grown out my
bangs so I can do the same thing do a
style like this do a braid sometimes I
can even do I'll do like the the top
knot ponytail that's a little bit harder
because you have to change where you put
the extensions if you guys want to see
some hair tutorials as well let me know
because I can show like how to do braids
and stuff how to curl the extensions and
then how to do like ponytails are top
knots with extensions in because you
actually do need to change the placement
of your extensions you can't really have
them on the sides as much because the
clips will show so if you guys want to
see tutorials like that just let me know
I just wanted to do this video and just
show you how I clip them in but again
the front I think is the hardest part to
blend of and especially if you have hair
like mine or you have layers and they're
a little bit shorter so again you can do
the twist and pin them back and there's
a lot of different options that you can
do again I think curling is just a
really easy way to to help them blend in
but once you do that I have all my
extensions in so I have the four clip a
three clip a two clip and a one clip and
then this is all of my hair do you think
that it matches my natural color super
well which I was super super happy about
because I've only had one pair of
extensions in the past and the color
match was awful I tried to dye my hair
to the extensions and it totally did not
work so that was a huge bummer but this
is what it looks like with the
extensions I can turn around and show
you guys the back as well this is all of
my hair I love it that is that with the
extensions and quite a transformation
what do you think I will say that the
first time I put him in I think with the
floor clip especially it definitely
makes your head feel heavier but
honestly after that first night it was
just kind of like I got used to it and
it didn't bother me anymore so yeah
that was just my quick little demo of
putting the extensions in I know I'm
sorry I like not the best without having
anyone to like help me or do a camera
angles or anything but hopefully you got
an idea of it and some of my tips and
tricks for blending kind of help
you out but yeah that is going to be it
for the demo parts of my hair extensions
and now I just can't wait to go style
this hair I just I love them I love the
extension so much that it's gonna wrap
it up before this video I hope that you
