with my third video if I knew how to
like put music and like make balloons
come down from my ceiling I would
totally do that but I'm still very much
trying to figure out how to even just
edit these videos I was up all night
last night watching different youtube
videos on how to edit youtube videos oh
it's so confusing for me i am so not a
tech person i am seriously struggling
but i'm going to keep trying and
hopefully i will you be getting better
so we will just have to see how that
goes so for my third video i'm going to
be doing kind of like what's in my
mailbox so each monday on chiclet plus i
do a what's in my mailbox post and it
just kind of lists the books that myself
and my review team have gotten in the
mail that week whether that be our
physical mail or our email times we get
so many books that I can't put them all
in the post I usually will only do at
the maximum as six books that i'll list
because otherwise the post just goes on
forever and i just think it gets too
long so i tend to cut it off at six and
then sometimes we already have to book
reviews or to post going up on chiclet
plus and I I don't like to do more than
two you know sometimes three posts a day
but those are scheduled posts that I'm
doing I also post a lot for the CLP blog
tours so sometimes i have like up to 5
posts a day on chiclet plus so I try to
do only two book reviews or any sort of
review author interview scheduled per
day so sometimes i miss the mailbox post
on mondays and then the reviewed it
comes and goes for the book and i still
haven't been able to put it up on the
mailbox post and i miss my chance so
this might be a good way to fit a few
more books in i'm going to start with
three today because i don't know how
long that will take me i know that i
tend to ramble on in these videos i'm
going to start with three see how go see
how long you take see if i should do
more see if i should do less but
hopefully i can
at least one mail call video a week for
you just kind of how i would do on tikl
applause so we will just go from there
first book that I got is called twin
peaks and is by Tracy banister and so I
kind of figure out how to put a cover in
the move in this video so that didn't
work but I'm going to try to show you
the cover on my tablet here it is can
you see it I don't know if there will be
a glare or not but maybe you thought
maybe I'll figure it out by the time I
post this video really excited to read
this book because I I say that I know
Tracy personally but I know her
virtually we belong in a lot of the same
author groups we worked together a lot
before I love featuring her I'm chiclet
plus um I really enjoy reading her books
so I'm excited for this one um let's see
i don't know if i should like read you
the whole blurb that be weird if I just
SAT and read to you that might be weird
but so the main characters look like
Sloan who is a forensic accountant and
Willa who's a cookie pet psychic that's
fun and they're identical twin ok so I'm
really liking this already looks like
there's some romance involved there some
trying to work out some work stuff oh
there's sparks but the childhood friend
oh yeah and the end the very last
sentence is to get what they both want
can will it and salon band together and
rely on each other strengths or were
little differences drive them apart once
and for all so if I sounds like there's
a lot going on in the book I absolutely
love the heat the forensic accountant
and the pet psychic parts which just
kind of make me laugh I I'll be curious
to see how those work out and see if I
might need a new job just kidding the
next book I got is the silver cord and
this is by Alison caiola me
be that's how it's pronounced I am so
excited to read this because it is I
read her first book just a few weeks ago
called the seeds of a daisy and it was
so good I couldn't put it down I gave it
a five star review on uncheck love plus
and i'll link it in this box so you guys
can read it cuz i really hope you read
that book it really focuses on a
mother-daughter relationship and it's so
sad the mother gets into an accident and
it's like the saddest thing it was okay
it wasn't too sad like I didn't cry
throughout the entire book but my mom is
my best friend and we have such a close
relationship so whenever I read books
about a mother and a daughter and
especially when something's happening
with one of them it just really touches
my heart because I know how close I am
to my mom so I really really loved that
book and Allison herself actually
emailed me and asked if I would review
this next one because she loved my first
review so much and that just makes my
day when an author takes the time to
email me and say thank you and offer
next book and I really try to remember
that as an author myself to write those
thank you emails because they really do
mean a lot o course I said yes and I'm
really excited to read it because it
kind of picks back up the main character
is Lily and it helped this goes on this
is two years after her mother's car
crash and everything that happens with
that so we're kind of picking back up
where she is and she has a little
daughter who she well that's from the
first book too so I'll let you read
about that and that she goes back to her
ex boyfriend which I'm like what's going
on because I really did not like her
ex-boyfriend in the first book so I'm
super curious to see how this goes and
she also in the first book kind of got
together with a man named Robbie and of
course I'm like really rooting for him
but he went to Africa on like a mission
trip so I think he's gonna come back in
this book too so I'm really curious
especially
she's with the ex-boyfriend where she
goes so I am just so excited to read
this one I you know obviously I can't
tell you if I love it yet and this I
think you should go get it but really
you should really get the first one the
seeds of a daisy really good the last
one is called the idea of love by patty
Callahan Henry this cover is so gorgeous
I posted a book selfie on my Chiclets
Plus page with this book because I'm
like oh my God look at that dress it's
just beautiful I just I just thought
this book was was beautiful we follow
the very first sentence I'll read that
one to you says as we like to say in the
south don't let the truth get in the way
of a good story I'm not from the south I
did not know that's what they say down
there but okay and it looks like we're
going to follow Ella whose life oh dear
has been completely offended that's not
good she's young beautiful and deeply in
love until her husband dies in a tragic
sailing accident while trying to save
her well that just gets worse or so
she'll have everyone believe oh okay
those like first three sentences I'm
like what is happening okay so that
looks really good right there I don't
want to read anything else to you
because just those sentences have me
totally reeled in so this one should be
a really good one to read I of course
will share my review both I'm trick lip
gloss and probably on here too and i
will link it to you so let's seriously
just I mean you can even just get it
from the cover because it's just so
pretty so those are the three books that
i will be reading here shortly hopefully
maybe one or two or all three stood out
to you because i'll post their amazon
links below I know Patty's is this is
the advanced reader copy that I got so I
don't know it might not be up yet it go
it comes out june twenty third so this
one is not on sale yet but I'm sure it's
available on pre-order so i will post
the link to the pre-order page so so
those are all three books

I'll get a few other ones up please do
tell me what you would like to see I'm
already getting some ideas someone

weekend this is so embarrassing my
little niece was here and she's in my
office and she goes will you give me a
guy cuz i want to dust your office I was
like oh okay so it's really best date I
should probably clean my office so I'll
clean it before I give you an office
tour but because I record on my phone I
don't know if it would be really shaky
the whole time if I'm holding it so I'll
try to figure that out but I've been
getting asked a lot of questions too so
I thought maybe doing like a Q&amp;amp;A video
could be really fun just kind of taking
all kind of like the random questions
that I'm getting it is all these like
little questions that I'm getting I
thought maybe I could do a Q&amp;amp;A video so
