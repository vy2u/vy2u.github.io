video I'm going to be doing another a
little unser unboxing but because that's
only one box and this video could be
like two and a half minutes long I
decided to kind of incorporate more with
it so I received a new box from
influencer and it's in collaboration
well with champion and Target and it is
a Sports Bra and because I'm very into
fitness I thought I would talk and
review not only about the sports Rob
that was sent to me would also kind of
go through some of my favorite sports
bras that I have like I just thought it
might be a fun idea this is like
literally spur the moment I wasn't even
sure I was gonna do the unboxing for
Influenster I thought I might just like
put it on Instagram and that would be it
and then I decided to film this today so
yeah let's see how this goes but if you
would like to see my unboxing along with
a few of my favorite sports bras please
keep watching with the influencer box
now I talked about influencer a lot on
my channel I've done several unboxings
for them but if you are not familiar
with influencer I will leave a link on
the description box below I definitely
suggest at least checking out the site
and seeing if it's for you but basically
what can happen is you sign up on their
site you link like your social media
accounts so they can see like what your
influences you take surveys and then you
can get boxes they are called box boxes
and with free products in them for you
to test and review it's very cool but
you don't have to be a blogger or a
vlogger to get the boxes like I know
people who just can do Amazon reviews or
talk about it on social media you don't
have to be any sort of like professional
reviewer or anything like that so I
think it's pretty cool like I said the
link will be in the description box
below for you guys to check it out and
see if it works for you but I was pretty
excited to get this box because like I
said I am very into fitness I do run an
Instagram account with my best friend
were the cheeky chicks so we do a lot of
yoga but I work out every single day
sometimes multiple or several times a
day I'm very active so I basically live
in sports bras I also get to work from
home so sports bras are the norm for me
I feel like I'm pretty fancy when I
put like a regular bra on I feel like
you you know something crazy is about to
happen like I'm gonna leave my house and
go out to a restaurant or something
most the time i still wear sports bras
there but this is the sports bra that I
received so you can find these these are
from the champion line and you can find
them at Target I do have a 20% coupon
code I believe it is that I will leave
linked in the description box below as
well it's not an affiliate link like I
don't make money off of it but everyone
who got this box box was given this link
to a 20% off code to share with people
so I'll leave that link below
he's you're interested I think it's
probably only gonna be 20% off this
sports bra not like 20% off your target
order because that would be pretty wild
but again this is from champion you can
find it at Target when I got it I was
like okay this seems like it's probably
gonna be like a pretty simple sports bra
which I like simple source bras and I
also like fun sports bras like you'll
see when I go through my favorites I
have kind of a variety and then I felt
it there is no like padding on the
inside there's no underwire there's no
anything like that like it is just plain
and then I was like I don't feel like
this is going to give me a lot of
support and when I when I was taking the
quiz about the sports bra and it said
like what kind of support do you like in
your sports bras and I said like medium
to full if that's the terming the terms
that I used but because I'm very active
I do a lot of like cardio I also am
larger chested I don't know how I want
to say that but I need to like make sure
that I'm not going to be going crazy
when I'm jumping around and like hitting
myself in the face and like falling out
of my sports bra so I do like to have
more support when I am gonna work out
and so when I got it I was like oh I
don't know if this is gonna work for me
but actually it really does and I don't
know I did mention when I reviewed it on
target that I go back and forth between
a small and a medium and my sports bras
usually I try them on just to be sure
but it's like I need a medium from my
cup size but I need a small for like my
around because I'm very small around but
then have the large cup size so it's
like it's kind of hard
I usually go towards the smaller size
because if it's too big then like as far
as my doesn't work if it's too big so
this one I thought was like kind of
small on me like if I wear it for a full
24 hours and sleep in and all that stuff
I kind of get like it starts digging in
to my sides and can kind of hurt but if
I just wear it for a couple hours and
like do a workout I'm fine but I think
maybe because it's smaller it's like
giving me more coverage if that makes
any sense but honestly like I thought it
was fine
I actually was very impressed with the
amount of coverage that it gave me it
doesn't bother me at all when I am
jumping or doing any sort of cardio
anything like that I'm totally happy
with it keeps everything in line
together supportive I do like the design
of it it's like I said it's like it's
pretty simple like you can see like some
of the outer stitching here but the back
is just the regular racer brach racer
back with the c9 logo on it but I like
it I can insert a couple of pictures
here that I've been sharing on Instagram
usually of me doing some sort of yoga
moves but I don't know I I really like
the way that it fits even though I
thought it was a little small like as
long as I don't wire it for her super a
long time I like the way it fits and I
actually do find it very comfortable and
it's one that like I have a lot of
sports bras a lot of sports bras and
this is one that I keep finding myself
grabbing which I thought was pretty cool
on first glance I was like yeah you know
like that'll be one that everyone's
smile I pull out of my drawer but it's
one that I've actually really liked a
lot it was actually in the laundry and
then I decided to film this video on how
to pull it out of the laundry just so I
could show you guys it but yeah I'm very
happy with it so again this is from the
champion c9 line which you can find at
Target I will leave it linked in the
description box below I will also leave
that 20% coupon there but big THANK YOU
to Influenster for sending me this I am
so very happy with it
and excited to try out a new sports bra
and now if you would like to see some of
my others
it sports bras if you're curious if you
just like sports bras or maybe you're
going on a shopping spree soon for
sports bras I have just like two brands
to talk about when it comes to the
sports bras one is Victoria's Secret one
is a brand that I found via Instagram so
I don't have a lot of like different
brands to talk about but the bras I feel
like are all it kind of different from
one another some are fun some are more
for fitness some are more for like
casual times you know what I mean when I
don't really want to work out but I
don't want to wear a real bra but like I
want to look cute you know what I'm
saying
one from Victoria Secret it's just a
like black-and-white print let's see
what it says this is from the pink yoga
line this is the size small that I have
I like this one because it does have
like a lot of support there is like cups
in here I guess I would say so I think
it is very supportive on me I think
almost sometimes they can kind of like
give me like a push-up bra fact which
isn't totally what I look for when I'm
going to work out but because of this
print I think it looks very cool
especially when I wear it with black and
white leggings which I own a couple
pairs of those when I paired the black
and white with a black and white and
then take like a really fun yoga pose
picture I think it looks very cool and
then sometimes even if you put it the
photo in black and white like it's just
very eye-catching to me so I wear this a
lot not so much when I'm going to do you
know cardio or things like that but I
think it looks very pretty
especially in yoga pictures so that is
from the pink yoga line what I have from
Ettore secret is from the vsx line it
looks like this it is kind of similar to
the yoga one and that it has like pretty
sturdy
cups it doesn't have really a lot of
padding but it does have an underwire in
it I like that it doesn't have the
padding because it doesn't do like the
push-up effect because I don't need that
so this is one that I do like to use for
cardio it has the vsx on the racerback
right there like I said like I don't
know if you can tell from this but this
is just like a sturdy a sports bra like
when I wear this I know my girls are not
going to go anywhere it's very
comfortable too
where it just has the little clips in
the back right here on the sides is kind
of like mesh which i guess is a little
fun when you wear it but also this is a
glow-in-the-dark sports bra so I mean if
you want a glow-in-the-dark sports bra
you can go ahead and check this one out
I remember when the line came out I
think they had like glow-in-the-dark
like a tank top and then also pants too
because my best friend has the pants and
I wore the bra and one night she wear
the pants and I had the bra on and yeah
we went in a closet a dark closet to see
if they glowed in the dark they did they
put in the dark I never really care for
that function I don't do anything that I
need to glow in the dark with but I
guess it's kind of fun yeah this is from
the vsx line so one of my favorite
sports bras to wear especially during
football season is from the Victoria's
Secret pink line and it is a Green Bay
Packers sports bra
I am a big Green Bay Packers fan and if
you don't already know that but I just
love being able to wear fun stuff like
this like during the season I really
want to get a Chicago Cubs one
especially because baseball season is
during the summer the warmer months
because sometimes the sports bra like I
can wear it when football just starts
like in the early September and then it
kind of like falls apart as it gets
colder and I wear more layers and all
that good stuff but I just think it's
super cute it's very plain and and basic
like there's no there's not a whole lot
of support but I can still wear it for
cardio like there's no push up to it so
it doesn't give that effect it's not
super supportive but it's not totally
like you're on your own so I can wear it
but I think the back is super cute too
it has the racerback but it's all in
lace which I just think is so cute and
then lace kind of along the back side
too but I just think these are fun
Victoria's Secret does have a pretty big
line of athletic apparel for whatever
your team's maybe I do have to order
everything online obviously because
because I live in Iowa we don't have you
know they don't carry all the football
teams and baseball teams and things like
that like when I go to Chicago
whenever we go we usually try to go like
ever here every other year for baseball
games I like to pop into the Victoria
Secret there because they usually have
Chicago Cubs stuff have more in the
store someone they just have online
which i think is fun but yeah if you
want to support your team and still get
your workout in it's a good way to do it
now this one that I have is I I think I
either a whole I think yeah I think I
called it once on my channel and i said
that i bought it basically just because
i thought it was cute and i thought it
could be like something fun to wear like
not really a good workout sports bra but
this is like really hard to show this is
what it looks like i have no idea if you
guys can even like tell this is a sports
bra but it's very complicated and kind
of twisty but it has these straps that
make an x in the back kind of like this
they stay pink on it is from the
victoria secret pink line and then the
top in the front just looks like that
and has the pink band underneath and
pink and it kind of looks like like it
kind of gives this cool like b dip right
here it looks very cool on it is a
little complicated to put on and i
bought it and i was like like there's
nothing to it like it's just fabric
there's no wires there's no padding
there's no cups there's no anything and
i was like this is definitely gonna be
more of like i want to take fun photos
for yoga that sort of thing it's not
gonna be something I can workout in but
again I was very surprised that this
actually does have more support than I
would have thought it was again it's
kind of like the Packer one where it's
not like the vsx one that gives you like
full support and I can do whatever it is
that I want and nothing's gonna move
like it's not that but I don't feel like
I can't wear it like I have some sports
bras that I'm not featuring here because
they're not part of my favorites where I
almost feel like I need to wear another
sports bra over that sports bra like it
doesn't do anything for me and I
probably should just throw those away
because why am i keeping them but this
one does give me more coverage than I
would have thought as first expected it
still does look really cute in photos
and like during the summer I think it
was a lot of fun to wear and I kind of
can't wait for summer to get back here
so I can like bust out some of these
cool sports bras again when I workout
outside and you know fun things like
that but yeah it's the one that I really
like I know it came in a lot of
different colors Victoria's Secret turns
over their inventory so fast so I don't
know if these exact sports bras will be
there but a lot of times they still have
the lines like the vsx line is huge pink
yoga obviously is a big line as well but
I know they have a lot of different
colors in this one I just thought it was
super cute honestly is why I bought it
but yeah that's another one and then I
have two from a brand like I mentioned
that I found on Instagram they are
called flexi Lexie Fitness and I I
really like this brand I believe they're
based out of Thailand and the reason
that I don't order from from them more
honestly is because they are pretty
pricey like their yoga pants are like in
the 90 dollar range which is pretty high
and I know they're sports bras are up
there too but also like the shipping can
kind of be extreme and take a really
long time to get here so I do have like
how many pants I have a couple pair of
yoga pants from them I think a pair of
like shorts and then these two sports
bras as well so I do like the brand I'm
just not able to order from them as much
as I would want to because of the costs
and the shipping and how long it takes
to get it set ro but these are
definitely bras that are just more fun
to wear so this is the first one from
flexi Lexie Fitness honestly this one
isn't my favorite I just wanted to
mention it because I have the two brands
from this company so I thought I would
show them both to you this is what the
back looks like it has these like fun
crisscross straps and then you tie these
at the neck and if you can see there is
cups inside them which I thought about
taking the cups out because they kind of
annoyed me more at first but then the
fabric is show up so sheer that you
basically can see through it so I think
really the cups are in there to make it
non see-through so that's why I keep
them in there but I just thought that
was very fun like it kind of definitely
reminds me of a swimsuit like I feel
like I could go and sit at the pool this
or no one
give me a second glance like I said only
wearing a sports bra so yeah definitely
very swimsuit like not any coverage no
no support in this one this is this is
the one that definitely is just for
photos and just for fashion not a
fantastic sports bra but just something
that I thought was kind of cute and fun
the one from flexi Lexi I think this was
the very first item that I ordered from
them like ever and I really really liked
it it is this black sports bra it's so
tiny I know so it is this black sports
bra it is a size small but the back
looks like this like the back is very
cool and intricate and a fun design and
I really like it I could've I I think I
should have ordered a medium I think if
I ordered a medium I would be able to
wear this a lot more because it is a
small it kind of rides up in the front
like I get like underboob going on quite
a bit which is a little annoying
it does look super cute and yoga
pictures I absolutely love it
especially when eyewear I have a pair of
black leggings from flexi Aleksey
Fitness that have sheer panels all
throughout the legs they are one of my
favorite pair of leggings I wear them
all the time I'm always getting asked
like where did you get your tights and
I'm like they're actually yoga pants
okay because I wear them out like
they're like my go-to staple out but
this one even though it's not like super
super great to work out in a reason why
I really like it and why I wanted to
mention it it's because I wear it under
shirts quite a bit I wear any shirts
that have like open bags or like open
sides especially during the summer time
and you don't want to wear a regular bra
because you feel like that looks weird
like you can wear the sports bra and it
doesn't look like a sports bra like it's
a little bit fancier but it's not a bra
to wear it's like girl I can see your
whole bra what are you doing when you
have something like this on with the fun
design and all that good stuff like I
feel like you don't get as many weird
looks so I wear this all the time this
is another one that I had to dig out of
my laundry because I just took it on a
trip with me but maybe not the best
sports bra in the world but a very cool
bra that I bust out everything for this
video I hope you enjoyed this kind of
like spur-of-the-moment unboxing slash
let's look at my sports bras collection
video kind of different I'm like I
thought I didn't go through all my
sports bras because that would be like
Oh Nellie it was actually very simple to
pick my favorite sports bras like mostly
because either they were in the laundry
just getting out of the laundry on me or
right on the top drawer of my sports bra
drawer like these are the ones that are
right on top because I'm always grabbing
for him so it actually wasn't too hard
to pick some of my favorites but just a
little bit different of a video I
fitness as a big part of my life so if I
can incorporate something fitness wise
every once in a while on here I will do
that I will say definitely go check out
the cheeky chicks on Instagram me and my
best friend Holly we work really hard on
our Instagram page and our yoga it was
very interesting when we decided to
start our page it'll be two years in
September that we started it that I mean
it's we have to do yoga every single day
we have to practice every single day
like yoga isn't something that you can
just like do half-assed and then be able
to put it out there like no you have to
practice you have to stretch you have to
learn the language like you have to
understand how to do the poses you have
to get workout DVDs and you have to
watch YouTube tutorials and figure out
how to do it and it is definitely a lot
of work that we put into not only our
yoga practice within our page as well
and all the people that we get to meet
on there and the challenges that we host
so we take it pretty seriously so I hope
you guys will follow us over there links
for that will be in the description box
below of course but I hope you will give
this video a thumbs up if you did enjoy
it make sure you subscribe before you go
and I look at you guys very soon in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
