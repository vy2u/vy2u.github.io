channel so today's video is going to be
a couple of influenster unboxings I've
recently received two boxes from
Influenster so I'm going to go over the
products that I was received that I was
received that I received to review if
you are new to my channel of course
welcome i am a big fan of influenster if
you are not familiar with the site i can
leave a couple of my influenster
unboxings below for your to for you to
check out but influenced our is
basically just a site where anybody can
sign up it's free and you can take
surveys and quizzes so the website can
get to know you and what it is that you
like what you're interested in and then
nice and do free products to review you
can review on influenster on Amazon you
can talk about it on your social media
etc so I think it's a really great
program I've gotten a lot of really
amazing box of boxes from them that's
what they call their boxes with review
products in it and it's exciting every
time that you get a new box box and
something new to try out and new
products defined so I will also leave a
link to influenster below if you have
not signed up I will leave my link down
there below I do get like a point if you
sign up for it and that helps your
overall score and getting bucks boxes
it's not anything like monetary or
anything like that but do want to
mention that I would get like a boost in
like my social media outreach or
something like that if you use my link
but if you would like to see the box
boxes that i have recently received from
Influenster or some that i received is a
large one it is from L'Oreal hair care
this is what the Box looked like and I
was pretty excited for it because it
came with a full size shampoo
conditioner and hair oil I was like okay
each box box there's always like a
little card on here that kind of tells
you about the products so I got the
nourishing shampoo and conditioner
lightweight formula for silkier softer
more lustrous hair and also the one I
received was the oil serum so I got the
lustrous oil serum which is ultra light
fast absorbing serum for silky shine
says this eliminates dryness in just one
wash there was also a coupon on the back
for two dollars off any l'oreal paris
advanced haircare product so each box
box comes with that so first to talk
about the shampoo and conditioner when i
get sent shampoo and conditioners but
for summers in the hacketts had a lot of
shampoos and conditioners it's kind of
weird but when I do I will cut out using
any other shampoo or conditioner and
only use the ones that I am testing so I
can actually see what they are doing to
my hair with no other variables in there
and I felt like I sounded like a science
teacher right there are the nourishing
shampoos and conditioners for the
shampoo it says daily care for dry
lifeless hair it supposed to be
lightweight and non-greasy it definitely
felt very lightweight so these all have
an oil complex with argan oil chamomile
coconut I'm las noches sunflower and it
says in one wash you're supposed to have
a lustrous soft hair exact same thing
for the conditioner these do smell
really nice i will say that that was
kind of like my first impression i was
in the shower they smelled really nice
they both just have these pop off tops
and then like so which is great um if
you can tell with the shampoo I mean I
made a little bit of a dent I only wash
my hair like two times a week so I don't
really use shampoo and conditioner a
whole lot so what when I get sent so
much shampoo and conditioner I'm like
what am I supposed to do with all of us
I will say about this is that I really
did enjoy it it does make your hair soft
but for me it almost made my hair too
soft like you know when your hair is too
soft and you really can't style it and
it's hard to hold a curl like if i were
to curl my hair when i was using this
product very faithfully it was very hard
to keep a curl and it was just so soft
and i feel like it was almost kind of
making my hair a little bit frizzier
because of the softness if that makes
any sense but I kind of noticed that my
frist came back a little bit when I was
strictly using these products other than
that I actually do think it does make my
hair shinier I wouldn't say
just after the first wash after the
first wash I will say I noticed that it
was very softer and you know kind of a
little bit more easy maintainable I
didn't notice the shininess and probably
after the third time that I used it or
looking in my bathroom mirror in our
bath downstairs bathroom mirror and I
was kind of I was game right on there
and I looked in the mirror and I thought
my hair looked different it it almost
kind of looked like I had gotten
highlights or something it just it
really truly did look shinier and I was
like oh that must be the shampoo and
conditioner that I've been trying out so
that really impressed me so I'm kind of
a middle-of-the-road on these leaning
more towards that I like them because I
like the way that they made my hair
smell I like the way they made my fair
hair feel and I liked that it made my
hair shinier the only part that I really
didn't like is that it made it so soft
that I felt like it kind of affected the
frizz of my hair but other than that I
really enjoyed them and I have gotten
past in my review time frame where I
feel like I can try you know go back to
my regular shampoo and conditioners are
just any other shampoo and conditioner
that I have in my shower but I do find
myself still reaching for these quite a
bit because I really liked him I'd give
him like a give him a 4 out of 5 how
about that fortified so the oil I am a
big fan of oils for my hair for my face
from my body for everything I just I
really enjoy oil so the oil that we got
was the extraordinary oil lustrous oil
shine with oil complex it says this
instant shine and silky touch it's
supposed to be lightweight non-greasy
leave in treatment for dry lifeless hair
this I don't think I actually liked it
as much as I expected I would just
because I'm such a huge lover of oils I
think it okay so it says it's now Gracie
I don't know I kind of felt like it was
a little bit greasy like I I don't know
how does it explain it but when I would
put it in my hair I feel like I really
had to wash my hands good afterwards to
get it all off and then I just kind of
felt like my hair was like slick that's
the word that I would use to describe it
but my hair was a little bit slick when
I used it I do think this helped
my frizz a little bit because the frizz
kind of got worse when I use the shampoo
and conditioner this kind of helped tame
the frizz which I did like but I did not
find myself reaching for this as much
again after I got done with the review
period this was not what I was reaching
to put in my hair I was going back to my
other oils and other products that i
like to use in my hair more than i was
this one so this i did not like as much
as the shampoo and conditioner which i
keep reaching for still a good product i
would probably give it like a 3 out of 5
but just something that I don't find
myself constantly moving on into the
second box I got this from it was in
conjunction with CVS and degree little
box looks like but it was a dry spray
deodorant and I put the card here let's
see it says looking for fresh gift dry
sprays a try gree fresh energy dry spray
antiperspirant with motion son's
protection radiating bright burst of
lily of the valley and T heart flower
okay dat real the hashtag is try dry
there's usually a hashtag with
everything I believe for the L'Oreal 10
is hashtag extraordinary hair and for
this one it is hashtag try dry so i
don't think i have ever used a spray
deodorant I've always used like a
regular one so this one was a spray my
first thing was that it was kind of hard
there's like a little guy up here and
you kind of have to like push it down
but up at the same time and I just like
struggle with it and if you could see
their like I could not use my index
finger I had to switch to use my thumb
so when you're trying to do this like it
was kind of hard for me to have to use
my thumb I'm talking a while I wasn't
very great at it but also when using and
it does smell good like I just sprayed
it I'm like ooh yeah that smells good I
was very fresh and it says on here fresh
energy and that's like kind of the vibe
I get when I smell it smells very fresh
and clean which is always nice so my
first notice was that it was kind of
hard to spray with an ass
so using a spray deodorant I actually
found kind of difficult because you know
obviously you're not just spraying
everywhere you have a specific target
and when you're trying to spray and then
I'm trying to use my thumb and I'm
trying to spray like I was spraying like
my arm and I was spraying down he like
it was kind of a hot mess I got a little
bit better as I used it more but I still
don't feel like I've like mastered the
spray deodorant which I don't know maybe
that sounds really stupid but I'm just
being honest here also it says that it's
40 hour antiperspirant um I don't truly
believe that because I feel like once I
go to sleep I don't wake up feeling
exactly like super fresh type deal i
would say i would probably last a whole
day though most of the time i did a
touch up here and there just because I
typically would do that anyways just
because I like to smell nice the only
like the biggest problem that I have
with this is that it leaves white marks
on my clothes and so it it goes on clear
and it looks clear throughout the day
but I was noticing that i was getting
the white marks on my clothes so I
haven't really used this with any
particular like shirt or outfit that I
really like because I fear it's going to
get on my clothes and then also it's
like it's like something where if I know
that I'm going to go out and be around
other people I won't use this anymore
because I know that it's leaving white
marks on my clothes so basically I just
use this for if i'm just lounging around
the house of the day where i know that
i'm not going to go anywhere but
obviously i like still going to put
deodorant on I'll put this on when I'm
just wearing like my comfy tee shirts or
you know workout shirts are things like
that this is what I will use so that's
like my biggest downfall and I don't
know if I can like truly truly recommend
this for that reason unless you know
unless you need just like a backup dude
right to have at your house like things
like that i don't know but that's kind
of what i'm using it for um just when I
know that I'm not going places because I
don't appreciate the white marks all my
clothes which kind of stinks but other
than that I do think that it laughs
throughout workouts like I'm
I work out every single day I do a lot
of yoga I also do a lot of like high
intensity interval trainings I do a lot
of cardio I do kickboxing and I felt
like this held up really good throughout
my workouts so I did appreciate that so
I mean overall I like the smell I like
that it lasts throughout workouts but I
don't like that it's not exactly easy
for me to spray out to hit my target and
leaving the white marks so I mean I
would probably give it like three out of
five stars but more like leaning to 2.5
stars because the white work the white
marks on my clothes is really like what
gets me not being able to spray well or
you know having trouble hitting his
actual under arm is fine and I could
probably like continually improve at it
but you know the white marks that really
really stinks and if that did not happen
I feel like I would truly like really
really everything for this video I hope
