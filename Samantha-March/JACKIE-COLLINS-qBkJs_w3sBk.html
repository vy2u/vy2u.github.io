is going to be a little bit different
from the other videos that I've done and
I'm sure you can tell by the title which
I actually don't know what I'm naming
this yet as i'm filming it but i'm sure
i'll come up with something by the time
i publish this but it's just going to be
a short little video about Jackie
Collins I think this might be kind of a
hard video to get through so I kind of
went back and forth sound like if I
should film it but I really want it to
um Jackie Collins was one of my favorite
authors I've talked about her several
times on this channel I've talked about
her books I've talked about being able
to interview her when I was just
starting out in the book world and you
know kind of what that meant to me feel
like this video is going to have a lot
of like me clipping pieces out because
it's just me like sighing and staring
into space because I'm so sad but so
just a fair warning but another reason
that I feel like it's just kind of a
tougher video to film is because Jackie
Collins passed away from breast cancer
and I lost my grandmother to breast
cancer as well so it's just a subject
that I tend to get emotional over but I
didn't want to let that stop me from
filming a video in no dedication to one
of my favorite authors and it is October
it is breast cancer awareness month um
so I thought that would actually be a
good Italian as well so i'll just try to
get this all out there and make it as
fast as i can but basically so Jackie
Collins she is I mean a she was a world
famous novelist she died on September
19th of this year 2015 from stage 4
breast cancer she battled the cancer for
six and a half years which is just crazy
just crazy to think about it's really
wild too
was I was actually traveling the weekend
that she passed away my family was in
town from Alabama they were in Iowa and
so I drove by myself with my dog halfway
across the state got to see them for
about 24 hours and then had to head back
home so while i was with the vino while
i was driving you know yeah i was born
half hours in the car by myself but that
means i am driving and i had to pay
attention I actually drove through
really horrible weather it was I was a
very scary night um but obviously I'm
not on my phone and then when I was with
my family I really wasn't on my phone
that much I wasn't on social media
pretty much at all that weekend so I
actually got home and it was it was late
at night that I got home maybe around
nine ten o'clock and I get on my
computer and I see people have been
tagging me on Facebook and Twitter
asking if I'd seen the news about Jackie
Collins and I hadn't so I was completely
shocked when i read that she had passed
away I was completely taken off-guard um
even though Jackie battled the cancer
for so many years she really didn't tell
anybody I believe she had told her three
daughters but that was it her sisters
actress Joan Collins she didn't even
tell her sister I mean she just she kept
it quiet and she said in a quote that
she kept it quiet because she didn't
want to be a burden which to me is
pretty crazy um you know everyone has
their reasons for doing what they do and
death is such a it's such a personal
thing I mean you can't really tell
anyone that they're right or wrong and
the decisions that they make but I
thought that was pretty wild because
even while she had cancer she was
traveling the world I think I read that
she wrote five novels while she had
cancer I mean I just I mean it just
blows you mind why do you think that
right got home saw the news I mean I
started to cry right away I am a very
emotional person anyways I had just left
my family that had seen in two years and
I was hearty sad home and read that and
it was it was so devastating
I mean this is such a huge huge loss and
it felt so personal to me even though
I've never had the pleasure of meeting
Jackie by any means it really did feel
like it was a personal loss that night
I'm still thinking about it I woke up
the next morning and one of my first
thoughts was you know I'd really like to
do some sort of video here on YouTube
just because I know that I've mentioned
her so much but I also talked about her
when I filmed my top 5 moments from
starting my book blog chiclet plus and
kind of getting into this whole world
she was one of my top 5 moments because
when I was first starting out in the
blogging world what i would do before i
would receive review copies from
publishers and authors themselves as i
would just go to the library i check
books out and jackie collins was one of
the first books that i started checking
out really just on the covers i mean i
was i was pretty much to grabbing on
covers and what seemed interesting to me
i did not know the name jackie collins
at this time i think i was 20 years old
but i didn't really know who she was or
anything like that i just started
reading her books and i liked him and
then I was like dang she's got a lot of
books out there and so I was getting
more I was reviewing them on Chiclets
plus and eventually one day I got an
email from her publicist saying that
Jackie wants to send me a copy of her
latest book and she also was wondering
if I would be interested in interviewing
Jackie for my website that was a point
in time that I explained in my video
that I was just like my mind was blown I
felt solidified in starting Chiclets
plus was very scary to me I was taking a
risk I was doing something unknown and I
was putting money that I really didn't
have towards building a website and you
know trying to get all this good content
on their spending my money to be able to
do that it was such a risky move for me
at the time and with him just a few
months of starting to have Jackie
Collins be requesting me to do an
interview with her it just was so crazy
seriously dream come true I mean she's
it was just amazing the interview that
we did I will leave below I've read so
many of her books and reviewed so many
of her books I will leave all
those links below if you want to check
any of them out if you have not read
anything from Jackie Collins you are
missing out her books are fantastic but
her books so this is her latest one this
is called the San tangelos like look at
this book when you buy one of her books
you will not be shorted I mean at all
you get a huge book and I feel like this
is a little bit bigger than some of
Jackie's books but Jackie's books are
always thick and you will just get an
experience when you read her books so if
you have not read any please please do I
pretty much picked up on Jackie once we
start it to get into the San tangelos
and once we started to get involved in
like lucky and you know and all those
sorts of things but I read some of her
earlier works as well and I just any
book of Jackie's i would highly
recommend there's a quote that i wrote
down from Jackie because I just thought
it was so interesting than one of her
interviews that she said if anything my
characters are toned down the truth is
much more bizarre and I just thought
that was so cool because she's always
kind of been in that celebrity world I
mean so to just think about her
experiences that she's had and maybe
what's been written into the book and
what could have possibly been toned down
in the book because her books are not
toned down I mean they are explicit
they're kind of raunchy I mean they are
just filled to the brim with excitement
there's always something going on the
st. Angelus is the latest book that she
wrote it just released this summer it
released june sixteenth it's right there
on the book because this was my advanced
reading company it is just her writing
at something else hurry world really
lost someone when she passed away so I'm
really trying not to make this video so
sad really hard for me to envision is
not having more of these show up in my
mailbox not having these huge books from
Jackie to look forward to that's so
crazy to me don't know for sure if she
has more Nobles coming out like if maybe
she wrote one or two and they just
haven't been published yet um so you
know maybe we will have more from Jackie
which would be so amazing but if we do
end her writing legacy on the same
tangelos I was such a good book oh my
gosh it was such a good book I mean I
give it a five star review I feel like I
give all of Jackie's books five stars
because they are on another level but
the San tangelos was an absolute blast
to read I just highly recommend it of
course for an older audience if I have
any younger people watching you probably
are not ready for Jackie Collins books
yet from not making this video too long
or too rambling or I'm crying too much
because I really just wanted to say a
thank you to Jackie Collins because she
inspired me because she inspired me
especially as a writer she's someone who
I looked up to so much someone who I
admired so much and like I said even
though I was never able to meet her I
was still able to talk to her I was
still able to interview her I still felt
a personal loss when she passed away and
I think that's a pretty big deal so I
just wanted to do a video to say thank
you you have not read anything from
Jackie please get her on her list
because you are missing out if you have
not read her books but of course on the
flip side I also did want to say since
October is Breast Cancer Month and
breast cancer has affected my family
personally and it is what Jackie battled
through for so many years early
detection is key please make sure you're
getting those tests please make sure
you're doing self test on yourself it's
so so important I don't want to you know
sit up here in and preach or anything
like that because that's not who I am
and that's not what I want to do but it
was just another reason why I wanted to
make this video especially in October
that we're all doing the think pink and
roll finding like cougar
all and all that good stuff is just to
remember that there's more than just
wearing the pink wearing the pink
ribbons on all that good stuff that
there's an actual college behind why we
do this that is just my friendly little
PSA that please get tested please get
checked please be doing the test on
yourself just a wrap this video up just
once again I just wanted to say thank
you to Jackie Collins I hope that she
inspired other people especially if your
other writers are readers and you
enjoyed reading her work I hope that she
inspired you in some way because she
definitely did to me I hope you've had a
chance to read some of her books if you
haven't please do go check them out she
has like a Chilean out there she's sold
over 500 million copies I believe it is
I mean that just that figure just blows
your mind right there she puts out so
many books a year like I said it's just
going to be insane to not have another
Jackie book show up on my doorstep
that's just absolutely devastating for
me to think about but I just wanted to
say thank you to Jackie Collins thank
you for inspiring me October let's think
pink let's buy like a girl let's make
sure getting tested and doing what we
can I would love if red Jackie's books
come on a comment below and say like
what your favorite book is or maybe what
you liked about her her books I would
love to hear from you guys i would love
to know if Jackie may be touched you in
some way or inspired you in some way I
would absolutely love to know that
because she was just an author that I
mean she was on the top of my list man
she goes on the top of my list and
throughout this video up now I'm sure I
did not do it justice because I kept
having to pause because I started to cry
and then I lost my train of thought ah
sometimes it just stinks being so darn
emotional that you can barely get
through one sentence gosh please give
this video a thumbs up did my voice just
cracked there I think it did I feel like
I'm going to go get some ice cream now
and try to calm myself down because that
was actually I knew this video is going
to be hard to film especially we're just
like lots of my grandma wonder why
as well and yeah that was that was tough
to film but I just it was just something
that I wanted to do so I'm happy to be
able to get this out there you enjoyed
it if you were able to watch it if you
are still listening to me ramble on I
mean things first still hanging out with
me I am wearing dark lipstick hopefully
I haven't had lipstick on my teeth
during this entire video because there's
no way I'm going to be able to record
this there's just no way but yes please

Jackie or if you know that you are going
