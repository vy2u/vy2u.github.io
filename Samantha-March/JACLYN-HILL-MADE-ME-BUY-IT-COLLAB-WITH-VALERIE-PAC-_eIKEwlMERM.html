today's video is going to be a fun one
it's going to be kind of a spin on the
YouTube made me buy it video I do have a
YouTube made my video I will leave a
link down below but recently I saw that
my friend Casey be here on YouTube
she did a kathleenlights made me buy it
and I thought that was such a fun idea
for a video so she just went through
everything that she purchased based you
know on kathleenlights recommendations
and I just thought that is so cool I
sent her an email I was like that was
such a good idea I think I'm gonna film
one too and she was like yeah girl you
don't can't wait to see her video and
then which makes this video is like
double exciting is that it's actually
gonna be a collab video as well with my
good friend Valerie Pak here on YouTube
Valerie and I have been friends on
YouTube for a very long time we've
collabed in the past together and we've
been talking for the past probably a
month or so and we wanted to do another
collab we just kind of figure out what
we wanted to do do we want to do makeup
tutorials that we want to do a tag do we
want to do a challenge what do we want
to do so when I saw Casey's video I
immediately then after I emailed Casey
to say hey I'm gonna do it you cool then
I emailed Mel and I was like hey what
about this do you want to do this type
of video and she said yes pre filming
this because if you can't tell from my
voice I am very sick so our scheduled
date isn't for awhile yet in the future
but just because of how sick I've been
I'm trying to like if I get a burst of
energy I'm gonna film because it's
really hard for me to like get up and
film and put makeup on and then edit a
video so I didn't want to be late so I'm
actually not 100% sure on who Val is
going to do but I'm excited to see who
she picks because you know of course she
was like there's so many that I could
pick from so if you guys like this type
of video idea let me know because there
are so many other youtubers that I could
do this on I just thought it was such a
good idea so thank you to casey for
starting this i will leave her Channel
and her video link down below of course
I will also leave Val's channel linked
down below as well as her video that she
puts up for this collab I'm just all
kinds of excited for this video I
decided to go with Jaclyn hill cuz I
looked over my makeup collection and I
was like even doing like the tallying
like you know I just wanted to make sure
whoever I chose I would have enough to
be able to talk about which that wasn't
a problem at all but I ended up going
with
Oakland because she really was one of
the first youtubers that I started
watching and the first one that I felt
some sort of connection with she wasn't
the first YouTube you know beauty blog
or video that I watched but she was the
first one that I watched I was like that
girl could be my friend you know what I
mean some Beauty vloggers and you know
this isn't like to take offense or
anything but some beauty bloggers to me
are like so over-the-top and so
glamorous and so all of these different
things I'm just an author in Iowa and
I'm like I don't feel like I feel that
sort of connection like there's so much
fun and they kind of transport me to a
different place but Jaclyn was the first
person that I felt like this person
could be my friend not that I don't
think she's glamorous because she's
glamorous and you know she can be bougie
she introduced me to that word but I was
able to still feel a connection with her
on a different level than I was feeling
since from some of the other ones that I
had been watching so that's kind of why
I chose Jaclyn hill oh I'm still a big
fan of hers today I support her I buy a
collabs that she's done I listened to
her opinions of course I like Jaclyn
Hills channel link down below
you probably don't don't need it but in
case for some reason you haven't heard
I'm chocolate Hill I'll leave her
channel link down below tell her I sent
you
alright I feel like that's gonna be a
really long video so I should probably
stop this intro thank you to Casey for a
great video idea and thank you to vouch
for collabing with me once again I love
both you girls and let's go ahead and
hop into the video so I don't really
have any like rhyme or reason for like
the order I'm gonna go in I just kind of
have everything set out on my desk and
we're just gonna roll with it I'll try
to get through this as quickly as I can
mostly because my voice is going to
probably go out at some point I cannot
fight this head cold it's so annoying
but I have two items here from L'Oreal
so the first one is the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi foundation this is obviously
a recommendation from Jacqueline Hill
like this whole video is going to be but
she just absolutely raved about this I
believe she put this in like her
drugstore like must haves favorites from
the drugstore video and I went out and
bought it I even bought it in the same
shade as she did this is like one of the
very first products that I purchased
based off YouTube and I was like I don't
know I didn't really like buy foundation
before then so I was like
know how you color match so she said
that she was in w5 warm and I was like
that's what I'm gonna buy I say I don't
I don't know why I did that but it's
actually a pretty good match I have it
on today but I am obsessed with this
foundation this is such a fantastic
foundation so thank you to Jacqueline
for recommending this to me because I
don't think I had tried L'Oreal like too
much in the past as I was like slowly
getting into makeup and I don't know
honestly if this would have been one
that I would have chose for myself so
super happy with this recommendation cuz
it's friggin bomb so another one this
was self-funding she did like a how do
like cream contour video and one of the
ways that she cream contoured was she
would buy like a darker foundation color
and then contour with that and her
recommendation was the l'oreal true
match foundation so obviously i bought
it in a shade darker again i believe
this was the shade that she bought and 7
I was like I'm gonna buy n7 as well and
she even used what kind of brush was a
camera the exact type of brush that she
used but I went out and bought something
as like close to that brush that I could
I found an elf brush at Target that I
felt like was like the closest to what
she was using in her video and I like
this is how I cream contoured in the
beginning this is what I did based off
of that video so thank you to Jacqueline
for teaching me your ways this was
before I had any sort of like cream
contouring or contour 6 or anything like
that this is what I use so some more
from the drugstore one is the Maybelline
eye studio eyeliner in blackest black it
looks like this she still like talks
about it and raves about this eyeliner
to this day so she was using it so much
so I went out and I purchased this and I
purchased a liner brush I don't remember
what brand it was just like something I
found at Target and trying to teach
myself how to do winged liner
so I think I'm the only person in the
world that doesn't like this eyeliner
because everybody else loves it and I'm
like I don't know what I did wrong just
dried up on me so fast I don't know what
happened but like the first three times
I used it I did absolutely love it
but then it just dried out and it's just
every time I tried to use it it didn't
look good on me so this one didn't work
out for me I don't know I guess I could
probably buy it again in the future and
try it again and maybe it won't dry out
but I guess I
definitely bought this because of
Jacqueline Hill so a couple primers to
talk about one this one was mentioned
and I think it was her best of beauty
2015 video and it's from Make Up For
Ever I got the step one smoothing primer
so she talked a lot about face makeup
forever primers and you know not only
just Jacqueline but so many people were
talking about these primers so I got me
a little guy to try it out it's honestly
lasted so long but c'est bon primer I
really really like this and I this would
be one that I would like totally
repurchase so thanks for that
recommendation it was a good one another
product that I purchased it because of a
Jaclyn hill was the Becca cosmetics
backlight priming filter obviously
Jacqueline is a big fan of Becca
cosmetics she has collab with them on
several different project projects but
she really really raved about this
backlight priming filter and I was like
I absolutely need to get it it is a
really good primer I don't think it's
one of my favorites because it almost
leaves my skin a little bit like to
Dewey but only pair this with like a
mattifying foundation because if I used
this with like a dewy or luminous
foundation as well I kind of just look
like an oily mess but it's also really
good to wear on your own like in the
summer when I had like a tan going and I
didn't really need to do much I would
just put this on it kind of just like
enhanced your skin and make it made it
look a little bit more luminous so I
really did end up liking this one so one
product that she talked about first so
long as the Chanel so late an chanel de
panne Soleil it has like crazy name but
she used that bronzer so often so I
didn't actually go out and purchase it
myself but I was sent a social Wok's and
basically it was so spa you can go to
their website and you can pick out
products that you want to basically
sample and they measure out little
samples for you and send them to you and
whatever like shade or color that you
want to get and you can try them out and
see if you'd want to purchase the full
size and I was like send me the Chanel
de Soleil bronzer thing I have to try it
out because she talks about it all the
time so I've used this actually like
multiple times I don't know if you'd be
able to tell it looks like I just put
like the smallest dent in it when I've
been trying to see if I actually really
do like it because it does come with a
hefty price tag because it's Chanel
obviously I've really been
but when I saw that this listed on the
social website and I could get a sample
of it I was like yes I me up because
Jacqueline always talks about it need to
try it out so some eyeshadows that I
definitely purchased because of Jaclyn
hill was the makeup geek eyeshadows so
this isn't my makeup geek eyeshadow is
the appellate that I have right now it
is definitely not enough aiya shadows I
need so much more but makeup geek was
really one of the first brands that I
purchased because of YouTube like not
something that I purchased at a drug
store or like Sephora also because
makeup geek you can only get on the
makeup geek website I never heard of
them before but I had been watching
Jaclyn for probably a few months at this
time and she came out with a my favorite
shadows from makeup geek cosmetics and I
was like wait a second I've never even
heard of makeup geek who are these
people
they were fairly affordable eyeshadows
they're not like super duper cheap but
they were fairly affordable eyeshadows
and she went through a long list of her
eye shadows and she spotted him she said
why she liked them what looks she used
with them and I really did sit there
with a piece of paper and I wrote down
all of the shadows that she mentioned
and then I would like star them or
circle them for like yes I think I need
this I don't have anything like this in
my collection that once watched really
well and I kind of like boiled it down
to my top 7 that I wanted to get I
really do enjoy these makeup geek
eyeshadows I really do want to purchase
more of them I don't know why I keep
holding myself back from doing it their
foil channels look absolutely amazing so
many people rave about makeup geek
eyeshadows I am wearing them today I
have creme brulee in my crease and then
glamorous all over my lid for a bronzy
look I love makeup geek shadows I'm
really glad that she introduced him to
me and that was one of the first videos
where I really like felt almost like I
was doing like makeup research that I
sat there with my pen and paper listen
to everything that she was saying and
like took notes from it it was so fun
but yes I definitely found makeup geek a
through Jaclyn hill so this was also
mentioned in her best beauty 2015 video
and it is the Kat Von D shade + light
eye palette I think she mentioned the
shades of my eye palette and the contour
palette as well which everybody goes
crazy for the contour palette but this
also got a lot of hype I think I
mentioned this in my YouTube made me buy
the video as well because this was
really really hyped up on YouTube and
she was the I think one of the very
first people that I saw like doing a
makeup tutorial with it and she was
doing a lot of the swatches with it and
I just thought like oh my gosh I need to
have that palette I am so happy this is
one of my favorite eyeshadow palettes do
reach for this palette so much they're
all masks they're absolutely gorgeous
and gets an amazing palette so big thank
you to Jacqueline for recommending this
to me alright we are almost to the end
but the next brand that I wanted to
touch on in general that I found through
Jaclyn hill was morphe brushes again
this was a brand that I had never heard
of because you can only purchase more
feet from the marquee website or they
also do have a physical store located in
California but I had never heard of them
and all of a sudden Jaclyn hill was
talking about them and she said she just
kind of like stumbled into the store one
day and was like this is amazing and
wonderful she started talking about him
more and more she eventually became the
first like affiliate from morphe because
they found out she was talking about
them and they reached out to her a
serbian affiliate and now the rest is
history and morphe is a huge huge brand
yeah so Jacqueline was definitely the
first person to introduce me to morphe I
have purchased so much from morphe I
just grabbed out a couple of things that
I know are like her favorite um one is
the 3 500 I shadow palette I mean that
this is a favorite of Jaclyn Hills and
mine and so many others the 3 500 had
like a cult following at one point it
was so hard to get when I made my
purchase I was pretty sure you could
only purchase one per customer because
they were just constantly sold out
everybody loves a 3/5 oh it's amazing
she also did a collaboration with more
feet and came out with a Jaclyn Hills
favorite palette I do not have that
palette and I wanted to tell you why
because I just thought this was kind of
a funny story basically she chose all of
her favorite like morphe eyeshadows and
put them all into a palette that looked
like this and I wanted to get it you
know I saw it come out I was super
excited about it I was like yeah you
know I'm totally gonna get that and I
was like you know I don't remember my
exact reason that I was gonna wait is
probably like I'll wait til I get a
paycheck which I only get paid once a
month so I'm like oh wait till I get my
pitch I can order it and it sold out so
fast I was like wait what cuz at this
point I was still fairly new to YouTube
and the beauty world and I didn't
understand that like hot releases and
especially collaborations with youtubers
sell out super quick I am much more
informed now I know that if I really
want to get something and especially if
it's like a collab with someone that I
need to be ready and on my computer
credit card in hand when it releases
because they sell out so quickly stuff
so that's why I don't have the Jack and
Hills favorite palette but it looked
pretty awesome but I did get the first
five oh I have other palettes but I just
this is one that I wanted to mention
but then she actually made a like my
favorite morphe brushes video and once
again I did the same thing with makeup
geek i sat there i watched her video
repeatedly and I wrote on all the
different brushes I circled the ones
that I thought I would really want to
get I went to the website and looked him
over I listened to her reviews I
listened to why she used each brush and
then made my decisions from there so I
feel like I don't even like me to go
in-depth on each one but I thought I'd
just mention them I have the M 439 which
is one of my favorite foundation brushes
I have the e for what she says like is
hands down the best blush brush of life
I would agree with that I absolutely
love it I use it for blush on a daily
basis I like the ìiî I use this to
either sweep away powder or sometimes
I'll use it to like set powder all over
my face on my favorite like fat little
brushes and I love it so much my brushes
that she recommended the Emma for for
one and the m4 for three both are great
for like Chris Burke and blending work I
love both of these and then also like
the more detailed brushes she
recommended at the e18 and then also the
e36 I used the e 18 for like inner
corner highlight and I used the e36 to
sweep shadows onto my lower lash line I
use this every single day I need like 10
more of these so I don't have to wash it
every single day because that baby gets
used the most and then for highlight I
have at the M 501 again I've used this
so much that like it's kind of losing
its like nice shape because I wash it
pretty frequently as well but the M 501
to apply highlight is amazing I'm so
glad that Jacqueline introduced me and
you know of course so many others to the
brand morphe because they are a great
brand they are affordable from them so
often definitely one of my favorite
brands so thank you Jacqueline from
making
spend a lot of money at morphe of course
the last products that I want to touch
on are a few more products from Becca
cosmetics that both are in collaboration
with Jaclyn hill so the first one of
course is a champagne pop when
Jacqueline collabed with Becca cosmetics
and created the highlighter champagne
pop everybody went frickin nuts over
this
myself included everybody was so excited
for champagne pop and for a very good
reason it's such a beautiful beautiful
highlight unfortunately mine has broken
which is very sad so I don't really want
to open this up but I was so excited
about it because I had never actually
purchased anything from Becca cosmetics
before so excited I knew that Jaclyn was
a huge supporter of Becca cosmetics so
when she did the collab with them I was
like of course I need a champagne pop I
got it and I've been so happy with it
it's an absolutely stunning highlight I
love it I was so excited for that collab
and just like so happy to see where
champagne pop has gone
she just had on her snapchat the other
night of like all the different
locations that it's in and it's just I
mean it's just like so incredible to see
but then they also came out with the
champagne glow face palette as well and
this was one when she announced it on
her snapchat that she was doing this
collab like I went bananas for it
because I thought it looked amazing
so inside if you open it up it does have
like a huge mirror and this is like a
boss mirror those mirrors not messing
around it's like one of my favorite
palette mirrors ever but inside you have
three different blushes and the two
highlighters so this one is a champagne
pop and then this one is Prosecco pop
and then you have the three blushes up
here I was so so excited for this
palette I did the like early order where
you could order it only through like the
Sephora app that's when I ordered it and
I was so pumped I didn't even hesitate I
knew better now when these collabs come
out you gotta get him quick because I
was so happy to get it and I absolutely
love this palette I love having the two
highlighters I love having the champagne
pop that's in here too because a lot of
times when I travel I just take this
entire thing with me and I don't have to
worry about bringing my separate
champagne pop too especially because
it's broken but Prosecco pop is what I
have from
highlight on today it's amazing I have
been middle blush on my cheeks as the
blush it's amaretto one of my favorite
blushes ever like ever I love this blush
and it overall I love this palette and
this collaboration when she came out
with it and she shared her video you
know it wasn't just it was something
that she kept saying was you know this
isn't just about makeup and it's not you
know just purchasing a makeup product
but she's been very you know forward
about her story and you know kind of
what she's had to overcome and you know
how her and her husband struggled and
how you know they were paycheck to
paycheck couldn't afford the bills like
couldn't even afford to eat and I
totally get that because I've been there
and I've struggled so much in my life so
it really is so inspiring to see someone
who comes from like you know I'm know
I'm Morgan say we have the same
background by any means but you know
she's someone who has struggled but then
has worked her ass off to get to where
she is and to see her collaborating with
a huge makeup brands such as Becca
cosmetics and then to see her product in
her face and Sephora's is hugely hugely
motivating and so very inspiring she was
one of the biggest reasons why I even
got on YouTube and you know because I
just felt so motivated by what she was
doing and then when I see her coming out
with new things like this and you know
she's supposed to be having her own
cosmetics line coming out sometime soon
here which I'm so excited for can't wait
to support it just is is definitely
motivating I mean I don't know what else
more I can say to that but she
definitely always you know sparked
something in me to keep hustling and
keep working hard and you know one day
it will all come together and one day it
will all pay off so you know this video
is kind of like a way to say like thank
you for constantly inspiring me and
thank you for constantly encouraging you
know not only me but I'm sure so many
other people out there so I just think
it's amazing so this video like even
though it's like fun and you know we're
talking about like hey thank you for
making me spend all this money and all
these products but at the same time it's
a way to say thank you because

been a huge huge motivator in my life so
it's awesome I want to say thank you I
