today's video is going to be a pretty
exciting one because I am doing a makeup
tutorial I have not done a makeup
tutorial on YouTube like I'll fall on
makeup tutorial since like I want to say
November of last year so this is new and
different for me and I'm excited I'm a
little bit nervous at the same time
basically the reason why I stopped doing
makeup tutorials on YouTube is because I
just didn't feel comfortable doing it
I'm not a makeup artist and I don't have
the strongest a makeup game out there
and I know that it was always kind of
hard to just film them and and feel like
I was having to teach makeup when I
didn't really feel like I was in that
position yet and I just would be
uncomfortable with them and I tried
doing voiceovers because I thought maybe
voiceovers would be easier and I
actually hated - voiceover is even more
she felt so uncomfortable to me and it
just didn't feel right and I felt like
really the only reason I was doing
makeup tutorials is because I felt like
I had to if you have a beauty channel
you have to make makeup tutorials right
and I was like you know what I I don't
believe that so that is why I kind of
stopped doing the tutorials I moved into
mostly just you know talking about
makeup videos reviewing makeup and that
sort of thing but of course I'm always
practicing makeup and watching videos
and trying to learn new tutorials and
techniques and I thought you know what I
think I feel good enough now and
comfortable enough now that I can go
ahead and make a youtube tutorial I'm
really excited to be doing these again
but also a lot of it too is not only
feeling more comfortable with myself but
I get requests for makeup tutorials all
of the time and I'm always like hey I do
them on Instagram I do mine Instagram
and I do I do a lot of makeup tutorials
over on Instagram it's so much more
comfortable for me there's so much
quicker
and all of that stuff but I do get a lot
of comments asking for makeup tutorials
and I thought you know what I feel
comfortable enough now to be doing them
and that is why I'm excited to bring you
this first makeup tutorial I hope to do
one maybe every week or every other week
and depending on what you guys want to
see and my schedule of course but I do
want to start getting back into doing
them now that I feel I feel more
confident about them and I also thought
it would be really fun and to kick it
back off my makeup tutorials here on
YouTube using the new ejection Hill and
morphe palette oh man there's been so
much excitement over this palette and
I've been having so much fun myself
watching all the makeup tutorials that
are coming out and so I thought what
better palette to like have the kickoff
to my makeup tutorial series once again
so that is what we use on my eyes today
I love the way this look came out I love
the way the whole look came out - you
know my hair we have a hair appointment
next week so nobody panic hair
appointment is coming but I thought this
would be a really fun one to kick off
the series with and very excited to be
doing another makeup tutorial and if you
would like to see how I got this look
using the Jaclyn hill and morphe palette
please keep watching
so the first shade that I'm going to
pick up is buns which is in the third
row right here let me use my Sigma e25 I
mentioned in my review video that I just
love this shade and I reach for it so
much whenever I am in this palette I was
funny because Jaclyn mentioned that she
didn't want it in the palette that linda
morphe like overwrote her it said no it
had to be in and I'm like I'm not the
shade man and I do have my eye primed
and then also I have just like a base
shade down to set the eye primer and I'm
mrs. go start working this into the
crease and I'm moving my brush back in
like the windshield wiper motions making
sure and then like when I get to the
outer part of my eye I kind of just go
in circles to make sure it has a blended
look out here so next I'm going to grab
a brush that came in like copper dreams
I think it was called brush set from
more
so it doesn't have like an actual name
on it but I'm obsessed with these
brushes I reach for them all the time
and then I'm going to grow up the shade
next to buns it is called rocks and they
really nice like a reddish brown shade
that's more red than brown but just
again it's a shade that I've reached for
several times on this palette I love
these reds in here I think they came out
so so well and I'm first going to place
the shadow down on the outer part of my
eye and just doing these small circles
because I want the most amount of
pigment the most amount of eyeshadow to
go on the outer part of my eye and then
once I have deposit most of that down
then I will start with the windshield
wiper motions going back and forth
focusing out here on the outer V running
my brush in circles just basically
repeating the same step as before I just
want to make sure most of that color is
coming on the outer part of my eye and I
like to do like towards the end of one
of the processes is I'll just kind of
like start flicking my brush out and
then I'll also turn around and I will
flick my shout out in because you don't
have a ton on your brush so it's not
like you're getting the shades
everywhere but I feel like it kind of
helps me have a more blended look so I
grab another brush from that same
collection this one has more of like a
tulip shape to it and I'm going to grab
this shade right here it is called hunt
it's a really cool like orange II rust
color it's again like one of my
favorites I feel like I say that for a
lot of big shades but I really like
beating this palette I have been
enjoying it so much so I'm just going to
put a small amount on my brush I mean
you can see that as a very pigmented so
I'm going to make sure I tap it off
pretty good and then what I'm going to
do is just tap of that shade first and
the outer V just tap it make sure we're
getting
most of the product onto the outer part
of the eye and then I will slowly start
with the circles and then I'm going to
again take my brush and just kind of
start like flicking it out and flicking
it in this one I don't really want to
bring all the way in I want the orange
mostly focused on the outer part of the
eye as well so I'm just going to focus
on doing these small circles and then
flicking in and pull him out my
terminology is fantastic I know so
prepared to be impressed and I'm just
going to do this until I feel like
everything is pretty well blended so I
mean what these eye shadow looks where
you're really focusing on a lot of
colors and blending a lot of colors
together
I mean you know schedule sometimes we'll
just make sure they carve enough time
out of your schedule to blend your
eyeshadows now I'm going in with Queen
and this shade is just it's just a boss
like I I mean Queen is a great name for
this shade it is crazy I'm not using
fix+ because this shade simply doesn't
need it at a true gold glitter
and it is I mean so I have to my brush
no fix less and just are you kidding me
it is insane you guys it is absolutely
insane but I'm just going to be packing
this onto the lid and I'm using a morphe
g20 brush and I like this brush because
it is so I don't know how I would
describe it but it's like really good
for getting into the crease because I
don't want to bring this glitter to too
high so I feel like this brush really
lets you place the product exactly where
you want the product to go this gold is
just absolutely insane I'm going to take
the first brush that I use to be Sigma
brush and just kind of lightly
blend back and forth I don't want to go
too crazy here because I don't want to
get the gold to high up and I don't want
to get the red and oranges like I don't
want them to just serve the gold too
much so I'm just lightly going to make
sure that we don't have harsh lines or
anything like that and everything is
blended together again I'm not using any
additional eyeshadow I'm just going to
do light blend here off-camera I did I'm
just a pretty small wing for me using
the DHC liquid liner and then I applied
my pure lashes and jet setter I like
them because they're pretty like PC I
didn't want to do lashes that were too
big or full or voluminous and really
hide the eyeshadows because I love these
shadows so much but I love wearing
lashes so these were kind of like the
best lashes for me so I'm going to go in
and do my face now summer start with my
primer I'm using the number 7 airbrush
away primer which I absolutely love I'm
typically someone that always does my
eyes before face unless I'm just doing a
very like simple basic look other and
yes because you know if she had those
have fallout or you know if you're using
glitter or you know things like that
that way your face makeup isn't already
done but for me when I apply like my
eyeliner I typically have my hands like
on my face and I don't like having
foundation on and then also for my
lashes you know sometimes I'm touching
with the sides of my face so I just
always prefer to do eyes before faced
coming with my Anastasio Beverly Hills
stick foundation I'm in the shade
natural this was one that I didn't
necessarily love when I first got it
like I thought it was okay but I've been
finding myself reaching for it more and
more lately and I think it's because
it's definitely like a light to medium
coverage like it doesn't feel really
heavy on the skin like it still does a
decent job covering so I don't know even
though I'm not a huge fan of light to
medium coverage I'm usually like medium
to full I've just been finding myself
reaching for this more and you know my
don'ts with you because it's summer
months and you know it's so hot outside
sometimes that having a full face of you
know heavy heavy foundation cannot be
super fun so could be another reason why
I've been reaching
or but I've really happened lately I
just like how it makes my face look -
like I like the finish of it so I'm
using my morphe of flawless sponge to
blend this and one of my current
favorite Beauty sponges concealer I'm
going to use the number seven radiant
glow concealer I'm in the shade 10 and I
love this guy as well I believe it's
been mentioned in a favorites video I am
just loving the number 7 brand like
right now they can do no wrong for me
their skin care their makeup products
like everything has been just making me
so so impressed their new brand to me
but I mentioned them in my 7 brand I
think you should try in 2017 video like
a whole coverage concealer by any means
I mean you can probably tell just on my
skin that you know it's a little bit of
a sheer coverage but it really does make
your under eyes look radiant and like
have a glow to them which I never knew I
really wanted in a concealer until I
started trying this one but it's like
good enough coverage Thursdays where you
really you know you don't need that full
coverage concealer you can get away with
this one but I just love the finish to
it so much and then I haven't been
baking a lot lately because I've been
dealing with like drier under eyes so
I'm just going to use my wet and wild
contouring powder or contouring palette
and use the settings shade side the
contour palette is in dulce de leche and
then I'm just using a Real Techniques
deluxe concealer brush and I'm just
going to place this on my under eyes to
help set the concealer I'm just going to
do a little bit of contouring with the
Physicians Formula bronze booster I'm
going to use the middle shade a nice
kind of more like grayish contour shade
and I'm going to use my Sigma fo 6 this
is such a good little brush for
contouring so I'm not going to do a
whole lot just a little bit of shadow
underneath my cheekbones it's what I do
when I'm contouring is all to kind of
make you know one of those spaces and
you can see your cheekbone kind of
protrude out and then I just take my
brush right underneath that I'm so
excited to be using the Becca cosmetics
and Chrissy Teigen face palette
oh I had a subscriber friend sent it to
me and I was like no way because it
itself beautiful Oh like oh my gosh so
beautiful so much fun I'm going to take
my signal large powder brush the f30 and
I'm going to tap it into the bronzer
shade and then just work on bronzing up
my face I have tried this before and
holy crap like these are so so Pegman it
like i went in way too hard with my
blush so trying to keep that in mind
this time around to maybe not go in
quite as fiercely dialects I did with
the Jackson Hale palette was using all
like the greens and blues it is on
Instagram right now which I'm marched
Beauty word I do so many tutorials over
there so I'm just like much more
comfortable filling them and feeling
like I'm not having to talk through
everything and like peach things because
I'm not necessarily good at teaching
makeup yet you know I'm always still
learning so I'm going to pop off your a
real quick and do my brows and then
we'll move back to finish off the eyes
and the base rather done I'm going to
finish off my eyes I'm going to use my
TARDIS double take liner I'm going to
use the gel liner side and apply this
into my waterline then for my lower lash
line I'm first going to apply some buns
and then add a little bit of hunt's i'm
using the morphe e36 brush i'm going to
grab the morphe e18 it's a little bit
bigger of a pencil brush i'm going to
come in with the second shade right here
which is called bheem I still need to
find I know I had double say at tape I'm
going to tape the shade names onto the
top of the palette and you find my tape
because I hate not knowing what the
shade names are I'm going to use this to
highlight the brow bone I'm also going
to use that same shade and put it in my
inner corner also here using the same
brush then to finish off the face I'm
going to go back into the becky a Becca
and Chrissy palette I'm going to use the
blush and my morphe for I'm going to try
to apply this very
lately when I use it the first time I
got away at hand and then I'm going to
come into at this highlight shade I'm
going to use a Lexi 522 with tapered
highlight brush and apply this to my
cheekbones it's so pretty
I'm also going to apply just very
lightly down the center of my nose
because my nose and my Cupid's bow
nothing crazy here though for my lip
color I just picked up a makeup forever
artist liquid matte lip shade I just got
my packaging from Sephora yesterday so I
really want to try this I got the shade
103 that is what it looks like I
believed I put these in my wish list
video cuz I'm pretty sure that I did and
I was really excited to get them and
then when I was buying a couple things
for my 20k giveaway which is coming very
soon stay tuned I was like you know what
I'm just going to get one of these
lippies so I see how this works
oh it feels nice okay so it was pretty
sick I don't want to say it was Lucy
that's pretty sick the very opaque as
well but there is the makeup for ever in
shade 103 it's kind of almost like a
like a peachy beige nude I really like
that shade I had no idea what she had to
get because like six choices and they
were all in the nude range I was like
what you want the Rose too so I wasn't
103 and I really liked it it feels
comfortable so far I'm really excited to
finally have one of these written out
