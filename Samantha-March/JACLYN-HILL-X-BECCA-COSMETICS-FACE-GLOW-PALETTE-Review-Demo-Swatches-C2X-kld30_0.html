am so excited for today's video because
it's going to be all about the new Becca
cosmetics and Jocelyn Hill champagne
face glow collection whole my goodness i
feel like this box is so bright that i'm
like gonna blank you guys so i was so
excited when jaclyn hill first announced
on her snapchat that she was
collaborating again with becca cosmetics
and it was so funny because in one of
her videos i mentioned in her comment
section that i couldn't stop staring at
her highlight and then she came out and
said it was actually her new highlight
that she was wearing i was like that was
most beautiful highlight I've seen I
cannot wait to buy this and for some
reason I kind of thought she was just
gonna put out another highlighter like
how she's put out champagne pop and then
when I found out it was a collection
like at first I thought it was just this
face glow collection which has two
highlighters and three blushes and then
I found out that it's even more there's
eyeshadow palettes and there's different
forms of the champagne pop highlighter
and it's just crazy I watched her snaps
of the celebration and party that they
had in New York for her and I like cried
the entire way through watching the
snaps because it was just so inspiring
and so amazing to see her success and
it's just amazing and I was so excited
watching her snaps she announced that
they were letting people buy this glow
pellet early you had to use the Sephora
app and they only had a limited number
that they were letting go out early and
I was like a crazed woman I was
immediately on the Sephora app couldn't
find it couldn't find it I'm like this
snap just came through three minutes ago
looked at it serious like how many
pallets did they have up there what
could have happened and I kept looking I
was looking on Instagram I was like
what's going on and is something with
Android users we were not able to find
it on the Sephora app iphone users were
finding it fine android users were
getting the middle finger and i was like
what and i finally found someone posted
like a link on instagram and it took me
to it on my phone and i was able to
purchase it thankfully because i'm just
so excited so excited i was waiting if
you guys follow me on snapchat i
literally was snapping the mail truck
coming up the street like I snapped it
when I was a block over and I could
still see it and I was like zooming in
like I see you I see you come to me come
to me jaclyn hill is just one of my
favorite youtubers she wasn't the first
youtuber even like second like bigger
youtuber that i started watching those
little bit down the ways that i found
her channel but when I did I just
immediately felt something with her that
I hadn't felt with other bigger
youtubers I don't know if that makes any
sense hopefully if some of you guys are
youtubers yourself maybe you understand
what I'm saying but I just actually felt
some sort of connection with her that I
hadn't felt with other girls yet and
then as I know how to turn on snapchat
and flops start following her on
different social media platforms I just
her story is so so cool and so amazing
binds me a lot of like my own story and
I feel like maybe that's why I like feel
a certain connection with her like when
she talked about how like opening her
fridge and all she having the fridge was
a bottle of water and an apple and how
much she and her husband struggled it
just definitely made me think about my
own journey to being where I am and you
know never forgetting the time where I
went to my boyfriend at the time I think
it was maybe like 20 years old 19 or 20
years old and I was like I just don't
have any money to eat like I can't I
can't afford to buy groceries I can't
afford to go buy food because I was
trying to put myself through school by
myself and buying books and you know
living on campus is expensive and I was
like I don't know what to do i'm feeling
so down i worked three jobs like how
come this is happening to me it's crazy
because i'll just never forget him
opening up his cabinets in his
refrigerator and taking grocery bags and
filling them with food so i could
actually eat it was so cool i have since
gone and married that man did you just
connect with Jacqueline on so many
different levels and it's so interesting
just feel like people who get so mad at
her when she posts about her shoes or
her bags or her clothes or her car or
something like when she shares her
successes and people get so mad
I just I will never understand that we
want to see people exceed I don't know
why people get mad when people do well
for themselves and work hard it's not
like she's a reality-tv star and just
stumbled into fame or is famous because
she can party or you know things like
that one if you just start on YouTube a
lot of people don't think this is a job
but it takes a lot of time it's
definitely a job and it's just been
really amazing to see her journey I
can't wait I know she has like her own
makeup line that's supposed to be coming
in 2017 I cannot wait to see what that
is all about so it's just so cool so
excited to be able to support her by
buying this palette and I can't wait to
show it to you guys but first I have to
show you my shirt because I thought it
would be the perfect one to wear for
today but you guys can see it it says
pop the champagne yo pop the champagne I
just thought this would be like the most
perfect shirt to wear for this video my
sister-in-law owns a boutique called top
love clothing and I saw this online and
I was like I'm gonna need to buy that
and then this palette came out I'm like
perfect I'm gonna wear it for this video
just going to show you guys the pallid
to do some swatches of it a little demo
of it cuz i have no blush or highlight
on right now and just give my review and
thoughts of it and a little bit more
details about the collection that will
be coming out on May 26 so if you would
like to see some more about of this
beautiful palette please keep watching a
look at the palette this is wiped the
box looks like if I'm not blending you
guys too much but it's so cute and gold
and like bubbly suspect it cosmetics and
jaclyn hill on it this is what the back
of the box looks like it has
Jacqueline's picture a little bit about
the collection and it also does have
like a little grid down here that
explains what each one is and then when
you open it up this is the what it looks
like I mean this is beautiful like it is
so pretty but it also like feels very
like luxurious I don't know I like it
it's got a little bit of a month to it
the bubbles around it so it's becca
again a Jaclyn hill and it just it's
insanely pretty and then on the back
it's really nice to be
again it has those shades are inside it
come with the sample of the backlight
priming filter which is really nice and
then when you open it up it looks like
this it is stunning it has the smear
hello can you see my dog hello then
these are the five shades that are
inside and they are just gorgeous I
really do like this mirror because it's
so large like that's a big mirror but it
definitely would come in handy when
doing your makeup but then you have the
inside of the palette you have the five
shades it has jaclyn hill right here and
it is all mirrored which is cool and it
looks super nice so i can already tell
like i'm getting fingerprints on it I'm
like oh I don't phunk fingerprints on
those beautiful palette but it is
gorgeous I did share some swatches on my
Instagram as well i'm sure i'll be
sharing a lot more but i will be doing a
swatch and demo here but to give just a
little review on it and my thoughts this
is 52 dollars which when she said $52 in
our snapchat i was kind of like we'll
have the full size of the champagne pop
i did buy it and i think this is like
thirty-eight dollars on the sephora
website so you're getting two
highlighters plus three blushes the
blushes are like I think there are 32
dollars for a mineral blush and 34 for a
luminous blush and you get both
combinations in the palette to compare
size wise for the highlighter and this
is point two eight ounces so the
full-sized highlighter is point two
eight what you are getting in the
palette or point one nine so pretty
similar in size I don't actually own any
Becca blushes so I'm pretty excited to
try them out but yes I do own champagne
pops but I wasn't like a bummed that
it's coming in the palette because mine
is actually broken like I don't even
want to open this for you guys because
it broke has actually kind of excited
that she ain't pop champagne pop was
going to be in here too cuz I was like
yay an unbroken one it's going to be so
pretty this palette will be exclusive to
sephora so you can only get it on
sephora it is going to be limited
edition so i suggest if you wanted to
make sure you grab it I know I believe
champagne
was supposed to be limited edition as
well and they ended up keeping it on as
non limited edition so I don't who knows
maybe that will happen with this I don't
know since it's you know a palette
versus just a single product but we will
see I'm also curious to know if Prosecco
pop will be available by itself as well
like how champion Papa's I don't know if
it will but I will be curious to see
that there is more to the collection
than just the face glow palette so there
is also going to be an eyeshadow palette
and I can try to insert a picture in
here but it looks like I believe that
are going to be five shades in there and
one of them is designed by jaclyn hill
i'm not sure if the other shades are
already out there from becca or if their
new shades becca just designed them but
i believe there was one like a brown
shade that was designed by jaclyn hill
dasa in the collection is champagne pop
in different forms so they're champagne
pop like the regular shimmering skin
Perfector highlighter we're going to
have more of like a cream highlighter
than an Oslo champagne pop pressed
highlighter so the regular my lighter
the pressed highlighter and the port
highlighter i think is how it goes so a
few different combinations of champagne
pop which is pretty cool and pretty
exciting I'll go for sale and the
palette will also be going for sale on
May 26th so that will be for sale on
Sephora so if you want to make sure you
check it out so far from what I've seen
from this face glow palette is that it's
gorgeous I know the $52 might seem a
little bit steep but when you compare it
to what the single prices of the blush
and the highlighters are like if you
like Becca highlighters and you like
Becca blushes I think this is actually a
really good deal for you guys because
$52 verses 32 34 38 I made it all would
add up very quickly so I think actually
is somewhat of a good deal it's also
just such a beautiful piece it would be
gorgeous to show like on your vanity
like show it off you know one of those
products because it just is it really
really stunning but now why don't we go
ahead and hop into these swatches and
demo because let me tell you I'm excited
to put this on my face the blushes the
luminous blush is called rose a spritz I
don't that is what row
say spritz the looks light whoa that's
one swatch that's so pretty oh that's so
pretty okay the next one is amaretto
which is a mineral blush this one looks
more like on the bronzy side to me cry
so there's what that one looks aight
whoo so again very pigmented very pretty
just a little bit more on the bronzy
side i would say and then the last one
is Pamplemousse which again is a mineral
blush this one looks like a bright
almost like coral color so there is that
one ooh ok so those are the three
blushes swatch on my hand and that's
just like one little swipe into them and
thence watching them on my arm like whoa
these look gorgeous ok and then for the
highlights like if you've been living
under a rock and you don't know what
champagne pop looks like i will go ahead
and swatch it for you but it's a
beautiful champagne glow highlight so
there is champagne pop on my hand and
then pro psycho pop is much more of like
a true gold there is what that one looks
like and then oh yeah i mean you can see
the difference there right like
champagne pop is the one on top much
more of like a peach champagne and then
Prosecco pop is just gold it's just it's
just gold rose a spritz is the luminous
blush and then amaretto is the middle
more of a bronzy shade and then
Pamplemousse is like the coral pink
shade and this is also a mineral blush
and then we have champagne pop on top
the champagne highlighter and then
Prosecco pop on the bottom which is the
gold highlights hmm these are just yummy
like these are just yummy shades I'm so
impressed with all of them and now let's
the sum of my face take my morphe for
and I'm trying to
figure out what I should do blush wise
like how should I I don't feel like I
can add all three blushes to my cheeks
like I do have somewhere to be after
this so that might be a little strange
because I kind of want to like stick
with like the shimmery theme I'm gonna
take rose a spritz first and pop that on
the cheeks whoa stop stop do you see
that oh my goodness so I have not
applied any of this to my face besides
like champagne pop because I do already
own it I wanted to put it on my face for
the first time on camera and that is
insane that is so pretty was I honestly
probably didn't need this much product
on my brush that I had on because they
are so so pigmented that is crazy so
this could be good as a blush on its own
because it's seriously it's like a blush
highlight or I know that Jaclyn
mentioned it using us using it as like a
blush topper so what I'm going to do
next I'm just going to dip in the
amaretto just because I'm really curious
about this shade okay so this is
amaretto you guys see that ok so it's
definitely more of like a bronze shade
but it's still so beautiful like I was
almost like with this look good as a
blush but it really does only pretty
very pigmented I went back in and I
probably didn't need to do that now I'm
almost afraid to have like too much but
I'm just going to take like a tiny tiny
little bit of Rose ice roads and tap my
brush off really good and place it on
top of it as like a blush topper and it
kind of like try to match up my cheeks a
little bit since i am going somewhere
next but cool that is purdy like Rose a
spritz is Matt playing around Rose a
spritz on this side and this is amaretto
with Rose a spritz as a blush topper so
gorgeous so pigmented I mean you can
definitely go in with a light hand a
lighter hands and I used but seriously
this is gorgeous like I'm
a huge blush person to be honest the
reason why I was very curious about this
palette not only because it was
Jacqueline hill but I hear such good
things about Becca blushes and I don't
have any of them so I was like well this
could kind of like be my chance to hit
to Bert two birds with one stone yeah
the hit two birds with one stone and I
am really glad i did because these are
gorgeous and like just summer freaking
perfection so now i'm going to put
Prosecco pop on i have my trusty more
p.m. 501 i'm just going to put Prosecco
pop on just because champagne pop is not
a new release I've warm champagne pop I
just word in my bridesmaid makeup
tutorial like everyone starts about
champagne pop so I want to see what
Prosecco Papa's going on who feel like
this is going to be a lot of shimmer
with the rose a spritz but that's what
we're going for this is this look is all
about so I'm just going to take some and
place that on to my cheekbones I game ok
Prosecco pas whoa again this is the
first time I'm putting from psycho pop
on first time ever I just watches but I
have not put it on this is gorgeous ok
sometimes the camera doesn't like to
pick it up it's picking it up right dang
it really is just like pure gold pure
gold going on your cheeks to bring the
highlight in like right here on the
apples of my cheeks so like when you I
smile you can see it oh yeah you see
that you see that right there it's kind
of what i like to do but i'm gonna put
some above my eyebrows which is where i
normally would put some for a bit of a
eyebrow lift if you know what I'm saying
and then a little bit down the bridge of
my nose and on the end of my nose and
then also on my Cupid's bow feel like I
could just put this on all day I could
just keep putting this on this is such a
gorgeous shade whoo ok so there is
Prosecco pop on my face as a highlighter
and you just stop putting it on or else
we're to start looking a little crazy up
in here but that is just stunning make
it over the blush like look how glowy my
face is look how glowing my face is it
just is so pretty oh I hope you guys
enjoyed that first impression demo
because like i mentioned i had swatched
them prior but i had not actually
applied them to my face and they are
gorgeous I just fell in love even more
with the space glow palette now that I
am I'll blushed up and just like glowing
to the heavens that will wrap up this
swatch review demo video on the Becca
cosmetics jaclyn hill face glow
collection i hope that you guys enjoyed
this video and found it helpful
hopefully it helped you make a decision
if you do want to purchase this a
beautiful palette come May 26 if you
guys are going to purchase it or you
have purchased it or you're going to
purchase other things from the
collection please do comment below and
let me know because I am very curious to
see what people want to get or will be
getting with this I know remember that
even though it is $52 since it's on the
Sephora website if you spend over fifty
dollars you get free shipping so there
is that we get three samples with each
order and you'll get the Becca backlight
priming sample with this one as well and
of course you'll get your points not
that good stuff so that is a little bit
of a perk as well but I definitely think
it's worth it if you're a fan of Becca
cosmetics and you really like their
blushes and their highlighters this is
definitely worth it if you're a fan of
jaclyn hill and just want to be you know
supportive of her it's definitely worth
it but if you just like good high
quality products I mean have you guys
seen my face like it's good it's
luxurious I can't wait to have it on my
vanity it's just you guys want me to
show you one more time again I hope you
found this video helpful or useful and
enjoyed watch me put stuff on my face
because I had a lot of fun doing it I
hope you will give this video a thumbs
up if you did enjoy it thank you guys so
much for watching I hope you will
subscribe before you go and i will see
you real soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
