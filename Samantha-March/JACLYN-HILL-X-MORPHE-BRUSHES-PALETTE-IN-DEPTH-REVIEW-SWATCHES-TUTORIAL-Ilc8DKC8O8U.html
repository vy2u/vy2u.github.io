today's video is a very exciting one I
very unexpectedly received this package
in the mail from morphe brushes and
Jaclyn hill and Wow if you follow me on
snapchat you know that I was not
expecting this ballot at all when I open
it up actual palette is in here but this
was like the coolest thing to me I have
never received anything like that in the
mail and it was very incredibly
overwhelming I had no idea how I got
selected for this PR package but just a
big THANK YOU to morphe brushes and
Jacqueline Hilton of course to be able
to get the pellet early it just was so
shocking to me I've never received
anything from morphe I haven't gotten
any PR packages in the past I had no
idea this was coming this was completely
unexpected to me I am not affiliated it
was morphe I don't have a discount code
or anything like that like I said I've
never received anything from them in the
past I really have no idea how I was one
of the chosen ones to get this package
but I'm just insanely thankful but the
biggest reason is so that I could get
into this palette and let you guys know
what I think of it I know that there has
been a lot of hype around this pellet a
lot of drama and controversy but also a
lot of excitement and people are very
curious about the actual shades in the
palette and to be able to get this early
and to be able to make this video before
the palette launches I've never been in
this position before and it's it's a
really cool feeling that hopefully I
will be able to help some people make
the decision on to whether or not to get
the Palamon I also feel a lot of
pressure to get this real right I really
wanted to take my time and not do more
of like a first impression video I
wanted to really be able to give you my
thoughts in my review when I got it I
immediately sat down and watched it I
saw it with my finger I splash it with a
brush I have photos that I will be
inserting so you can see those swatches
and then I did one eye in one look I did
one eye in another look I woke up at
5:30 Saturday morning did one eye look
and another eye look took it off went to
spin class came back showered and then
created this look so I've been really
wanting to try to use as many different
shades on my eyes so I can actually give
my opinion and not just a first
impression and not just a swatch I want
it to be able to tell you how to
actually perform on the eyes I will also
be inserting a tutorial of meeting this
eye look with the palette so I want to
say again just a big THANK YOU to morphe
and jacqueline this was so overwhelming
so thank you to you guys I do not
believe that I got this palette solely
because of me it's very much a team
effort and I thank you guys so much for
the support and you know we did this
together so why don't we go ahead and
get started so for the palette here is
the outer packaging it is white and
silver it is the cardboard material and
then when you open it up there is a
little quote here from Jacqueline and
her signature and then we have all these
35 shades here this is $38 for the
palette you get 35 shades
Jacqueline said in her video that all of
the different eyeshadows are either
different formula or pressed differently
a different finish and how complicated
that is to do for a palette so I mean
there's math shimmers likes mediums
neutrals duochrome there's I mean a
little bit I hope everything so kind of
right off the bat I was disappointed
that there wasn't a mirror because I
love mirrors in my palettes I just find
them so helpful packaging I don't mind I
kind of like that it's not the regular
35 palette from morphe which is more of
like the plastic like I don't know I
kind of like it a little bit better than
that like I feel like it looks better
quality the white I have a feeling is
going to get dirty
very quickly um so I don't know I feel
like I'm going to leave around the
palette that being said the packaging
also didn't completely blow me away for
the $38 price tag
I don't know that's just me as I saw
that it could have been maybe just a
little bit better one thing I do also
want to note is when we got the PR
package it was only this inside I
noticed in Jacqueline's video she has
the actual box and then this is inside
the box and the box has like her four
photos on the back and there's also some
writing on the back I also do not know
the ingredients for these eyeshadows I
do not have anything in my possession
that says that I did a lot of research
online trying to find it and I can't
find anything that says that I know
people were really asking me if I could
compare the formulas in this eyeshadow
palette to other more piaggio palettes
or other eyeshadows health in general I
am going to be unable to do that because
I do not have that information so I
apologize I know a lot of people were
curious about the ingredients and I do
not have those so I do apologize for
that
I did appreciate in Jacqueline's video
that she went more in depth about kind
of why the pellet was $38 I knew that
she has said in the past that it took
two years for them to create and I
understand that that's a lot of time to
create an eyeshadow palette but I still
was really wondering about the $38 price
point most of the morphe 35o il palettes
are 22 and 99 so for this to be almost
double that price I was very concerned I
thought maybe the palette would be a
couple dollars higher because of the
collaboration and you usually do see
that with collaborations but I wasn't
expecting $38 and I was a little bit
strong by that so now you guys have seen
in Jacqueline's video where she talks
about the palette she explained about
the new machines about the different
finishes and the pressings of the
eyeshadows and she goes into all of that
detail so I'll have her video listed
down below in case for some reason you
haven't seen it so I can take what you
want to take from her video and what she
is saying but for me I appreciate it for
going into night detail and into a
little bit more depth I have no idea
what it takes to create a shadow palette
is good like a little mini lesson for me
on how to create makeup so for me I
appreciated it but why don't we go ahead
I know that you guys probably want to
see some swatches so let's go ahead and
jump into the inside of this palette and
get some swatches done so when you open
the palette up I do have to say that
also disappointed that the shaved names
are not on here there is like a little
card that comes from said the palette is
have each of the shape names on here but
me I'm like I just it's going to be
annoying if I ever tried to do tutorials
or talk about shapes and I'm always
going to have to remember to pull this
card I like I said I do have photos that
I'm going to be inserting other swatches
on my arm the first or like Cal swatch
is going to be my finger splash and the
swatch just below that is going to be
the brush swatch I did not select any of
these with fix+ they were all with a dry
brush I don't know if people are going
to be disappointed because I'm not going
to be lifes watching all of them I'm
going to pick some of my favorites and
swatch them on my arms but honestly to
me swatches I think are important but
it's most important of how the shadows
actually work on your eyes and I didn't
want this to be just a swatch video of
me with my fingers or even a brush
because when I get a new eyeshadow
palette I don't swatch up my arm and
then go out and tell people like look at
my new palette it matters what's on the
eyes and some pallets swatch bad and
perform great and some palettes swatch
gray and perform bad like it just it
depends on what is on the eye but I know
that people like swatches so that's I'm
going to insert the photo and then also
grab up some of my favorites so I can
show you here so starting in the top row
we have you know some of the lightest
shades here one thing that confused me
as well I mean you have 35 colors to
pick right there is no like matte like
bone colored shade or white shade
because the first thing that I do is i
prime my eyes and then I set them was
some sort of white or bone colored shade
and the palette doesn't have it I'm like
how how thirty-five shades like you
don't have that like staple first color
to go for because of these first two
which are enlightened beam they are very
similar to one another and I just feel
like I don't know what could have been a
little bit different and been a matte
but I do have in light as my brow bone
highlight and then also as my inner
corner highlight is a very pretty shade
I also have like legit notes here on
each of the shapes that I made it
between Jacqueline's video and then just
my own thoughts I have a lot of notes to
talk about I also have no
on my phone so I'm going to get those
ready too I really wanted to make this
like a good review video next to which
are silk cream and M SEO or made for
each other they are very similar as well
to kind of like your light brown
transition shades and to me was like you
could have one and not the other
especially because there's other shades
in here that could be used as transition
shades I just wasn't sure why those had
to be so close I know she said about the
different undertones but I don't know it
to me they were just super similar and
then we have the three shimmer shades in
here so we have faint which is more as
like a very light pink shimmer metallic
and then sassy which is a duochrome and
that one is very prey it is pink and
gold and I did think or I'm sorry sissy
sissy and I thought that one was really
pretty as well and then little lady
honestly these three shimmers when i
swatched them they didn't do a ton for
me I tried both a sissy and little lady
on my eyes and I liked them much more
here are a few swatches we have in the
light and then sissy and little lady so
there they are squash shot on my hand
and again especially for these shimmers
like they are pretty swatched but
especially like when I did the brush
swatch I was just kind of like
underwhelmed of like I'm not sure once
you put them on your eyes they're much
much better actually get them on your
eyes like I just really feel like you
can't accurately judge them yeah so out
of the first row I mean I liked them and
I thought it was fine I thought some of
the colors were too similar to one
another the metallics on what I would
also recommend with these metallics is
to have a wet brush a mac fix+
for a little lady I found like that one
was better with some fix+
sissy on its own though is gorgeous
that's a very very pretty dual chrome
moving on to the second row I was super
excited to see this row like it looked
gorgeous it was calling my name in all
sorts of ways so the first shade we have
is creamsicle which is a matte shade and
when I saw it it reminded me right away
I think of chickadee from makeup geek at
the makeup geek single shadow I've
always wanted tricky Dee
I seen it Jack
Hill in a lot of carmakers beach
tutorials was always playing with
chickadee and I always wanted that shade
so when I saw it that was immediately
what my mind went to was anybody else
that way I was so excited over that one
and then we have butter again a really
nice transition shade we have three of
like very similar colors I mean even
pooter the one next to it like there it
was just there are so many other colors
but I felt like could have happened and
it pukey which is like baby puke color
which I know that might be weird but one
of my favorite shades as well then hunt
is absolutely stunning I remember
jacqueline saying in her video that
Linda morphe was it really the one that
like finally got this shade right and
kudos to freaking Linda Murphy because
that shape is gorgeous that was also one
of the first ones that I used all over
my eyes and I could not get enough of
that shade it was absolutely stunning
and then we have fire work which is a
really nice like orange red shimmer and
then Queen which is like a true gold
foiled shadow and it is phenomenal
phenomenal it's slotched fantastic and
it went on the eyes fantastic I kind of
want to show you a lot from this row
because the store just had me all sorts
of excited so we have chickadee and then
pukey and then hunts now I will say with
these shadows as well there was a lot of
kick up in the palette and very happy to
say on the eyes there was very little
little fall out of the shimmer shades
gave me a little bit of fall out also do
want to swatch firework and Queen Queen
is I mean I don't know man Queen was
like one of the stars of this palette it
was so so gorgeous and I'll try to do
Queen love so you can see it yeah like
that shade is sick so that is firework
in Queen that second row was really
really good I can see myself in that
second row I mean I can see myself
creating multiple eyelids from that
second row alone I feel like you can do
a lot there with your transitions and
then with those beautiful chickadee and
hunts you could do different things and
then the two shimmers are absolutely
phenomenal I think that row really
complements itself I really could like
live in that second row so the first row
had me
a little bit I don't know if I want the
underwhelmed but just a little bit on
the scent the second row I was like
having a dance party in my office
because I was kidding so excited so
moving on to the third row we have
obsessed I know Jaclyn thought this was
a very tough color to make and is it
very interesting shade it has a nice
light shimmer to it and I think it would
be really pretty all over the lid like
it's not metallic and it's not like
super overpowering but it would be good
for an everyday live shade and then the
one next to it is SBN or smoky but
natural I used this on me on my eyes and
one of the first times that I was trying
to look from this palette it was just a
shade that really spoke to me and again
kind of like what I thought
with obsessed SPN was it's not metallic
or super overpowering on the lid but it
looks really nice again I think that you
would have even better color payoff with
this one if you used my six plus and or
you know some sort of like water or
liquid on your brush I think you would
have more of that metallic look but if
you didn't want that and you want it
more natural no cubed natural then skip
the liquid one next to that is help stir
so stir which is a really gorgeous shade
and this one is a like a cream shimmer
is what Jaclyn described it as one next
to that is Roxanne which is a matte
burnt red again one of the first shades
that I tried I was so into that and
again Jax which is right next to it I
paired that with Roxanne in one of the
first looks that I tried with this
palette and I really enjoyed both of
them and then buns is the second to last
one over here and it was funny in
Jacqueline's video she said that this
was the one that Linda wanted in the
palette and Jaclyn did it because she
thought it was basic and she said that
she wears it so much I have created what
five different looks I think now with
this palette and I used buns in like two
or three of them it is such a good shade
I used it on my eyes today too
it was like my very last step to just
blend out all the shadows I love that
shade it's a wonderful my favorite and
then the last one is a crayon Apple
which is a really nice a cranberry
shimmer shade this one is definitely
more metallic than these other solutions
that we have in the beginning I don't
think that you
six plus of that unless you want a super
poppin cranberry look that one is very
very good on its own these are the last
three and the power we have rocks and
buns and cranapple these would make it
really pretty pairing all together so
those are just some quick a finger
swatches right there of those really you
love like the wrist the the cranberry
shades but I like that we have some of
the lighter shades is there as well
again I suppose the world really
complements each other very well and you
could do a lot of looks within that row
with a thirty-five shade eyeshadow
palette you know there's not really like
a theme to it you know it's the sweet
beach palette and everything is kind of
peachy and you know the new Urban Decay
Naked key palette they'll kind of have
the same color scheme and theme this one
doesn't but I appreciate that each row
makes sense to each other and I think
complement each other really well so
that was another thing that I kind of
took away from the palette you have
royalty I'm Jacqueline describes it as a
shimmer purple pressed with a glitter
that shade was insane let me tell you
and then we have torque which is a blue
and it's just incredibly hard to
describe this blue because it is
stunning it's not something that I would
normally gravitate towards but I do want
to put it all over my lid just to see
what it looks like because I'm so
curious next we have hustle which is
another shimmer and it is more of a cool
tone shimmer shade next to that we have
meat which is a really beautiful bronze
shimmer it has taken everything in Medan
acid to use that shade yet because it is
so stunning next net we have 24/7 which
is on my list right now all over my lids
this is a shade that Jacqueline said you
really want to use with a wet brush or
to apply with your finger and so that is
exactly what I wanted to do and she was
wearing it on her lid in her video where
she was talking about it and I thought
it was so gorgeous I think it's gorgeous
honestly when i swatched it it was kind
of one of those that i swatched and like
would kind of forget about it was until
I went back to watch Jacqueline's videos
I could take more notes but when she
said that and then I looked at her eyes
I was like I'm going to try that shade
and it I am very excited for that one
and then the last two we have chip which
is a matte cooled Brown and it has
purple undertones too
the one next to it is mocha which is a
warm fudge brown you have both of these
on my eyes because I do have the last
three shades on my eyes I went ahead and
just put the first four shades so we can
see them watched out okay so there are
those first four shades I don't feel
like this role complements each other as
well as some of the other roads because
we do have these kind of like more crazy
pops of color but these the last few
shades here I feel like do complement
each other very well with work together
very well and I was very impressed with
these masks I was super impressed for
24/7 and then I do like the white geese
watch especially meek so that was the
fourth row okay in the last row we have
a pool party which is also a duochrome
with gold and aqua blue and then we have
Jada which is a really pretty like
almost like a seafoam green type of
color I will say that one didn't swatch
the best with my finger or a brush and I
do need to get that on my eyes to try it
out to see how it is the next one that
we have is Deva which is a really nice
green shade I did put this one on my
eyes on West and chanted this morning
when I was trying out the palette and I
will say that both of these two I didn't
think swatch too great with my finger or
my brush putting them on my eyes this is
super easy to blend out and this looked
really well paired with that green and
it looked very pretty on the eyes I
don't think that you need a mac fix+
with that shade but I think it would
help it be more metallic if that's the
look that you're going for but I really
enjoyed both of these colors and then we
have Central Park what she described as
like a coffee shade and that's exactly
what it is a very deep brown shade and
then we have soda pop which has some
purple in it yet she described it as a
dark purple and then abyss which is
supposed to be a blast last two shades
it did not swatch well at all with my
finger or a brush
I think the black looked very patchy on
my eyes it was almost like skipping when
I was using my brush to apply it so the
last two shades I really I did not enjoy
it to be honest are some swatches on my
hands from the last row pool party and
chanted and then soda pop in a bit I'd
want to include two that I really liked
and then to xur eyes don't didn't love
as much
soda pop in a bitch the dark purple and
then the black honestly I didn't really
find that to be black
I mean it's black but it's not it's not
the most like intense pigmented black
that I've ever seen in a shadow and
again the last two I did tried both of
them on my eyes and they just didn't
blend out very well the book shades I
didn't love but a lot of the other ones
in the last row I found to be very very
good so those are some of these swatches
on some of the ones that I wanted to
pinpoint from the palette as well
hopefully the photos helps you out also
but for my tutorial I think I have been
set in the correct way that I went in
with pooter for my first crease color
and then I did mocha as my second crease
color and then I did chip and I focused
chip like mostly on the outer part of
the be just to the V of my eye just to
give it some more definition out there
and then I did what my brother went in
was 24/7 and put that all over my lid
it's a little bit of buns on a brush as
well and then blended everything out
with that shade I have in light on my
brow bone and inner corner and then on
my lower lash line I combined puter and
a bun that looks in here from me doing
my makeup as well so you can see how
they actually apply and again to me how
the shadows apply to your eyes is the
most important over swatches any day and
I'll say that when I did the finger
swatches I got pretty excited I really
enjoyed them I did the brush swatches
and I was like mmm some of them work
honor her derma mass blend out very very
well there is an exception of a few of
those shades like soda pop and abyss
that I mentioned but for the most part
the mass are blending out nominally I'm
very very impressed with them yet
they're still super pigment at the same
time and there's no fallout from the
maps which I appreciate the shimmers I
mean we have so many different finishes
summer shimmer some are metallic some
have glitter some are foiled it's kind
of you know kind of all over the board
so it's hard just to say one thing about
the shimmer give me some other shades
that could have been in here versus
having a
of the same thing but that is kind of
what I thought about the shades overall
with the shades once I actually did put
them on my eyes I was very impressed
like I said I had five different eye
looks with this palette in less than 24
hours because I really wanted to be able
to get them on my eyes to tell you what
I think about them on my eyes and not
just on my hand because I don't feel
like that's super super helpful
hopefully some of you will agree but
might kind of my thoughts there after I
have everything on my eyes that they
work very very well pigmented blended
easily showed up well there's definitely
more hits in this palette and there are
misses in this palette there are hits
and misses of course but definitely the
hits to me outweighed some misses and
once I started putting everything on my
eyes and seeing how it turned out and
seeing how they look I was getting very
very excited kind of my tutorial and
overall thoughts and how they actually
do apply to my eyes so that being said
to finish out the video I do want to
talk about the price and if I think it
is worth it and who it is worth it for
so you guys might have caught my will I
buy it where I talked about the pellet
and I said that I was really struggling
with the price because it is almost
double of what a regular Morphew price
is one thing that I do want to mention
is that affordable means something
different to everybody I used to work as
a travel agent in almost every single
client would come into the office and
say I want to go here if I want I wanted
to be affordable and my response to that
was always what is affordable to you
because everybody is different
so for some thirty eight dollars as an
affordable palette for others thirty
eight dollars is a really expensive
palette now Jacqueline did say in her
snapchat it wasn't in her video but it
wasn't her snapchat she did say that the
coupon codes will apply to this palette
she has a coupon code a lot of other
influencers do have a coupon code for
10% off so the pehle is $38 if you use
your 10% off it comes down to 30 for 20
that is the price range that I was
expecting this palette to be in I do
appreciate that we can use the 10% off
code oh that is for us a one other thing
that I know sucks about
Calla it's like morphe is that they do
have expensive shipping in the u.s. at
shipping is 795 so if you get your
pellet 34:20 with your 795 or paying
42:15 for the pallet that is getting
pretty pricey you do get free shipping
on more feet over $75 in the US again I
know people in Canada are saying that
they are going to have to pay over $100
I think I'm pairing 120 dollars skin and
you guys are just going to have to
decide if that price is worth it to you
but speaking for the US now you're
looking at $42 for shipping what I was
going to do when I decided that I did
want to get this pallet ideally went
into my morphe account started putting
things in my cards that I have wanted
from morphe for a while I had brushes
from there I had lashes in there I had
another liquid lipstick in there and I
very quickly very quickly reached my $75
mark to get my free shipping I would
suggest if you do want to get this
palette and you do want other items from
morphe you place them all together and
get your cart ready before the release
because this release is probably going
to be crazy I do have a morphe
collection video I can leave it down
below where I recommend a lot of my
favorites or if you have a friend you
know maybe someone who lives close by
maybe you guys both want the Palio in
together make the order together and
then that way you can hopefully hit that
free shipping mark as well those are a
couple of my ideas what's the price and
with be shipping so maybe that will help
some of you guys out that is what I was
planning to do myself when I had decided
to order this palette I did go ahead and
purchase this palette myself what I've
returned is now am able to get along
with multiple multiple shades in here
I've really enjoyed the eye looks that
I've created and I really do like the
shadows I would not return this palette
if I bought it say that a friend has
this palette and I was playing with it
what I decided to purchase it yes I
would not every single shade in here is
a hit for me not every single shade I
will use but there is enough amazing
shades in here that I would use so I
would purchase this myself with my own
money so a lot of people have had
questions on the formula because they
were saying this is such a different
formula with their new machines and the
new ways of making the eyeshadows and I
know a lot of people have asked what do
I think about that it's kind of hard to
say across the board because all of the
shades are so so different with the
different
is what I will say is that I feel like
this palette reminds me a lot of the
morphe 35o are which is one of my
favorite palettes I think it's the best
palate that morphe had put out to date
and when I bought it as very impressed
when I was talking about it talking
about this in my will I buy a video I
said if the quality is the same as the
3/5 are I will be insanely insanely
happy because I think it is great
quality I think there are a few shades
that are just like the 35 are I think
there are a few shades that are even
better Queen in particular is a very
nice foil to shade and I compared it to
some of them in my 3 5 are and I do
think a queen is better so there are
shades in here that I think are that
same quality there are shades in here
that I think are better and there are
shades and hairs that I think are worse
to be honest again I'm looking at these
two shades right here they really did do
much this shimmer shade up here really
didn't do a whole lot either there's a
lot of shades in here that I absolutely
love and I'm really happy that I was
able to put so many of them on my eyes
to be able to say that and say that in
full confidence that on the eyes I think
that these perform very very well I'm
really happy that I decided to do that
it's been a very stressful and
interesting almost 24 hours and my eyes
are kind of like full in but I really
wanted to be able to get as many of
these shades on my eye so I could tell
you very honestly and truthfully what I
think of them and I think that they
perform fantastic on the eyes most of
them think it's worth the $38 that's a
little bit tough for me because I feel
like that's pushing it the discount code
really will help to knock it down to
more of the $34 range but I say it's
going to be really silly if you don't
get your 10% off because I think that
you definitely should use it on this
palette again that being said would I
recommend this I would I really honestly
would and I know I'm going to get people
saying that I'm only recommending it
because I got it in PR a lot of you guys
probably don't know me or don't know me
personally or maybe don't follow me on
snapchat and you haven't seen me
dedicating so many hours to this palette
to swatching to creating all these
different ilex to creating an eyelid
taking it off putting a new one on
watching Jasmine's video over and over
again just going into this palette and
just thinking and thinking it through
I really wanted to come on here and give
an honest review and get some really
good feedback and to try to help you
make your opinion I'm not going to tell
people that you should get this palette
I'm not going to tell people they
shouldn't get this palette I'm going to
tell you my thoughts and my feedback and
let you take that and take what you know
other youtubers are saying and form your
own opinion you get to do what you want
to do with your money you get to do what
you want to do with your makeup
purchases but bottom line is would I
recommend this yes
I hope sincerely doesn't helps you but
those are kind of my final thoughts on
this palette I don't know how long this
video is going to be but I just want it
to give as much information as I could
have as much feedback as I could in this
video because I get that I've never been
in a position to be able to make a video
on a makeup launch before it has
actually launched so I tried to take
this very seriously but after that I was
going to do it for my thoughts watch
this tutorial and feedback on the new
Jaclyn hill and morphe brushes palette
alright guys so that is going to be
everything for my review video on the
new adjustment hill and morphe brushes
palette I feel like you could probably
tell that I was nervous in this video
but I just I took this review very
seriously I wanted to do the best that I
could because like I said I've never
been in this position before and I just
really wanted to do the best that I
could for anybody watching this video I
sincerely hope that you found this video
helpful in some way hopefully some of my
opinions or thoughts you are able to
take and make your own decision on this
palette I worked really hard on this
review video and I just really really
hope that you find it helpful in some
way and again a big thank you to more
feet in Jacqueline for sending me this
palette that's kind of a moment that I
will probably never forget I looked
about Jacqueline Hill a lot in my videos
on YouTube and about how she has
inspired me she was one of the first
people that I started watching on
YouTube but so to get a package like
this from her really a very big deal to
me like really did overwhelm me in the
past way so I just want to say thank you
to them and thank you to you guys for
supporting me because I I know and I
understand that I wouldn't be in this
position without your love and your
support appreciate it so much and it's
not something that I will ever take for
granted kind to one another in the
comments remember that it is just makeup
but it's not only just money
money is very important to people so
don't attack one
for wanting to spend their money on
something or not wanting to spend their
money on something that is a very
personal decision and I get really
discussed it when people attack each
other about how we should spend our
money because that is our personal
decision really love to know your
feedback and if you plan on getting it
again the palette is going to be as
$38.00 of how it will be available on
the marquee website on Wednesday June
21st I don't have a specific time at the
time that I'm filming but once I do I
will insert that into the description
box but thank you guys so much from the
bottom of my heart thank you and thank
you for making this video possible I
hope I did well for you guys if you did
