today's video is going to be my January
favorites or my first favorites video of
2017 so I'm super excited for this video
honestly I feel like I don't have a ton
to talk about on this one because as we
got closer to the holiday time I put
myself on a pretty strict no x and I
continued that into january i actually
just made my first makeup purchase this
week so I haven't been trying out a ton
of new stuff but I feel like for
februari I will hopefully have more to
talk about because i have bought a few
new products and i've also gotten a few
things sent to me recently that i will
be testing out throughout the next
couple of weeks here but of course so if
you have a couple favorites that i want
to throw in here for you and then just
on this as well but if you'd like to see
what i've been living on in the month of
january please keep watching ok so why
don't we just start with the mix just to
like get it out there and get it over
with and then we can move on so i was
sent these from Influenster these are
lore'l everpure sulfate free volume
shampoo and conditioner so these were
sent to me from Influenster in a box box
so these were really big mess for me
unfortunately because i've actually
featured l'oreal shampoo and conditioner
i think it was in my November favorites
video and I talked about how much I
loved it so when I got the notice from
influencers I was getting deeds I
thought fantastic i'm probably going to
love them and I did not love them at all
so my first big issue with it is it says
that these are good for volume is very
very thin thin hair and these made my
hair so thin I was kind of talking about
on my snapchat alike when I told my hair
in a ponytail I'll usually wrap my 23
times I was wrapping my point until four
times and still like when I was working
out my hair was falling out of the
ponytail that's helping my hair was and
that typically does not happen and then
also it made my hair so staticy and I
remember the first time that I realized
that my hair is staticy and I was like
oh must be because I war had to me I
mean it's winter in Iowa I wear a hat
basically every day but I was like no it
must be because of the Hat and in my
hair was still sad again remember
I actually washed my hair I only washing
the hair toys a week so I wash it again
because I was like so static it's
driving me crazy like I don't need to
wash it yet but I will and it was still
strategy and I'm like maybe it's the air
is dryer maybe it's like super duper
cold right now and that's what's making
my hair staticky I wash my hair again
with these again still statice and I was
like I think maybe it's these so I
switched and went back to my like
regular shampoo and conditioner no
static and my hair was still thin but
it's not super duper thin so
unfortunately these did not work out for
me and I'm super bummed because a lot of
people on snapchat so that they really
liked it but no these were a big no go
for me I will be passing these along to
someone else who would get better use of
him ok so now to jump into my favorite
I've kind of a different favorite that I
wanted to talk to you guys about and it
is sent bird so send bird they sent me a
perfume to try it was maybe in my socks
over November was a couple months back
they reached out and they asked if they
could to meet their perfume sample to
try and you know test them out and I was
like okay sure I was a little bit leery
about it because an out of a perfume
person mostly because I typically forget
to put my perfume on before I leave the
house and then I like man that sucks but
I was curious at reading out because
they're just these little guys so
they're easy to throw on a purse so I
thought maybe that will help me with my
issue and I actually ended up really
really loving it I actually so I have
two different guys here they come in
these little bags so they just drop but
I actually have another one in my purse
to the original one that I was sent that
has like this much perfume lost in it
that will use the rest of that up but
then I actually reach out to me again
and asked if they could send me another
sample and so I picked one out and they
sent it to me and then they also sent me
an extra one of like 30 cent of the
month which I just thought was really
cool and super nice but I wanted to
mention them because I went having such
a good experience with them and with the
perfume so it comes in this little bag
that says Sanford on it and then inside
you have the little vial that looks like
this
then you can twist it up and then spray
for the perfume or if you take it out
that's what it looks like and it does
have the sense right here in case you
can't remember so this one is my
burberry black witch that was a sense
that I picked out I think last month or
the last time I got one I think I picked
out a Protestant maybe I'm recalling
that right and then this sent this other
one that they sent me that was there
sent to the month was the mailing in
goats Dirk rum not sure if I'm saying
that totally correct these are just what
they look like and I just like them
because they're super convenient for me
like I said I'm the person that forgets
to put perfume on before I leave the
house it has been a really easy and
convenient quick way and they're small
they don't take up a lot of room I can
put these in a clutch I've been really
happy with these I've also been getting
a lot of compliments on the scent of
them and even like when I've been
pulling them out of my plush my
girlfriends are like what is that can I
try some of that because I just had this
huge file perfume that I shoved in my
purse but that looks so much better and
I'm like yeah it totally is pennisi cool
way to try designer perfumes for a
cheaper price so it's a 1495 a month and
then each month you get to see new
perfume uh sent out to you I think it's
a really cool concept and cool idea and
I've been loving it way more than I
thought that I would I kind of thought I
would just be like oh this nice to have
like good to have glad I was able to try
it out but I've been finding myself
recommending it more and more to people
especially even people like in real life
because I think this is something that
comes in handy for a lot of people so I
wanted to mention it in my favorites
video because yes I've just been loving
on sanford xq products to show about
that i can't show you show you so I'll
play some pictures in here but one is
because they are eyelashes and I just
feel like it doesn't really do eyelashes
justice if I just pulled up like one
false eyelash so I will find the box and
put them in here and try to insert a
photo samee actually wearing the lashes
as well but these are the ardell 113
lashes and I am obsessed with them I
first saw someone wearing them on
Instagram and I was like I need those
lashes I couldn't find them in store and
I finally just ordered them off alta and
I've been obsessed with wearing them
ever since they are super light they're
very wispy but they're long and
they're just beautiful I love art doll
lashes they are super inexpensive and
I'm definitely going to be else
on the 113 lashes so another product
that I have to share about is skincare
and I am freaking out because I can't
show it to you because I can't find it
I'm literally looking around my office
like could it be on the ceiling where
does this go but it's the doctor brained
oxygen facial so I think it was just
like a last week or two weeks ago I
filmed my complete skincare routine and
collection video so it had all of my
skincare down here and then I thought I
took it all upstairs to my bathroom but
I couldn't find it so i think it's just
and then i also tried to clean my
bathroom after i did that and I'm like
where where did I put that because I'm
starting to get a little angry because
obviously I mention his favorite video
because I love it and I'm like I need
the tingly pneus on my skin where where
am I put that so the dr brandt oxygen
facial i did talk about it in my skin
care video but it's just an oxygen
facial so when you put it on it looks
like you have like shaving cream on your
skin it's super bizarre but within like
five seconds it starts to like tingle
and you can kind of like see the mask
like bubbling and topping it's super
cool like it just feels fun on the face
like it's an experience when you put it
on but it also makes your skin look
really healthy like gives it a nice glow
it's supposed to be super hydrating and
also just makes my skin feel nice I spin
like addicted to using it and it says
you're only supposed to use it I think
like twice a week and there's times
where I'm like okay i know i used it
that day i know i use a bad day so i
shouldn't use it but should i use it i
don't know like i wish i could use this
every single day look I wish it said
that was for daily use because i have so
much fun using it so the doctor bringing
oxygen facial I'm about to go tear apart
my house so I can friends again but I've
been loving on that I also want to talk
about my nail polish because I've done
my nails like this a handful of times
and I get a lot of questions of what I
did to my nails so I do have acrylics I
do is when i go to get my nails done
usually the first thing that they say
when I say oh I need to fill they say
pick up your color and I say oh it's
okay i just paint my nails at home
I mean I've been going to the same place
now we're probably like the last four or
five fills and I fer you still every
time they look at me like what and I've
tried to explain like I have so many
nail polishes and I get nail polishes
sent to me and you know I take pictures
a lodge and I'm on videos and I like to
switch up my nails blah blah blah and
they still give me like you don't want
to paint your nails like I think I'm
crazy and I know that but it's true I
have a ton of nail polishes I'm
constantly painting my nails repainting
my nails I get bored with colors so
easily but what I keep coming back to is
this like really I mean this is like
clear but was a little bit of pink it's
kind of like my own spin on the ombre
trend but everyone sitting right now
because no nail salon in Des Moines Iowa
can figure out how to do that so I
haven't been able to have on that
trading because I totally would so this
is kind of like my own take on it
totally not the same thing but it's like
my interpretation of it and the nail
polish that I used it to get to that
effect is kiss on the sheiks is from OPI
and then I just do a really light layer
like I do most of it at the base of my
nail and then as I bring the brush up
like it's very very light this kind of
hob doing more hombre even though
honestly I don't know if I feel like
it's like super ombre but I like to
think in my head with us and I'm doing
so I just focused most of the color and
pigmentation on the bottom of the nail
and then as I brush up I'm not adding
any more nail color to it but I keep
reaching for this one and I can tell
that I'm going to have to get a new one
soon because this isn't like a new nail
polish to me I found this in my
collection and I was like I thought that
would be really pretty and then I became
obsessed with it so kiss on the cheek
from OPI so one product that's been a
total stand out for me from the first
time i use it is the Urban Decay heavy
metal glitter eyeliner and I have mine
in Midnight Cowboy so it's just a
glitter eyeliner i use this in my n
white in my in hawaii i used this in my
new year's eve makeup tutorial and it is
amazing I was hearing so many good
things about it everybody was raving
about it and what I did was I actually
got it in the extravagant eyes sephora
favorite set it came with a bunch of
different I products in there but this
one was in there
this is twenty dollars originally the
whole set was forty dollars like it was
a total seal really thought that I
picked it up I don't think it's
available anymore but in case it is i'll
leave a link down below but this is to
me it's definitely worth the twenty
dollars and i want to buy more colors of
these because i think they are amazing i
love glitter and i love playing with
glitter it's not something I do on a
daily basis but when you want to do a
glitter look and you want to do
something fun you need to have glitter
right but the problem with me with
glitters is that they always burned my
eyes and I feel like that's very very
common when people talk about glitter
eye liners this is matt four in the eyes
in the slightest for me you can wear
this for hours and hours and hours
without having any sort of i irritation
and I'm totally impressed that it's
beautiful I love the color like this
gold color is super pretty but I would
look to even get some other like more
colorful ones easy to use stays on all
night super impressed with this and this
is a new eye shadows to me and I'm not
going to lie you guys i've only used
this two times but i already like I knew
from 10-1 that this was going to be a
favorite I was like I was like mask over
when I tried this product and I realized
how amazing it was it is an eyeshadow
from colour-pop it's in collaboration
with Amanda steel and it is in the shade
hydroplane what this color is amazing
this is like a total mermaid shade and
it is beautiful it's like the blue green
it has selective like purple iridescent
in it and it is just so so called this
was actually sent to me from activate
and when I was applying to you know
house color pop perhaps send me
something I went with hydroplane because
it's such a different colors not
something that I would normally purchase
for myself and so I thought why not try
to get something different color pop
said to send it to me that would be
really cool and immediately for the
first time is that I put it on my eyes I
was like this is so cool as my instagram
tutorial is up by now i will leave it
linked down below but i did useless for
instagram tutorial as well I also wore
it in my previous will i buy it look as
well as if you'd want to see it on me
there are some examples there I think
what got me the most is that a lot of
times with Michael
help I shadows they really don't apply
well with a brush like you really do
have to use your finger and that's why I
don't gravitate towards my clutter pub I
shadows a lot no matter if it's a dark
color a light color a sparkly culinary a
glittery color you still really just
need to use your fingers and because i
have these long nails it's hard for me
to put my fingers in there and then also
apply enough constantly like poking
myself this went on so well with the
brush I use a regular flat shader brush
when i use to shade and i had no issues
with it it went on perfectly fine showed
up super pigmented i love this color
like i did not expect to love this color
but I hi love distiller the last night I
decide to talk about our lippies just
have three of them but the first one
that I want to talk about is from Milani
it's the amor matte metallic whipped
cream so I started hearing a lot of
people start raving about these and I
was like okay maybe I could try to find
some Milani to me is such a hard brand
to find and now they are in CVS stores
which we finally just got it for CBS in
Des Moines one day I was there randomly
perusing the makeup aisles like I
normally do and I found them I was like
I got to get me these metallic lists are
amazing so this was all so i think my
first foray with metallic lip i'm pretty
sure i'm saying that right and i kind of
didn't know what to expect and I was
blown away these are super pigmented
they are super comfortable I wasn't
quite sure like how comfortable metallic
look would be on the list notes they're
totally fine and they are just beautiful
I was so super impressed with this I
love the color I love the way it looked
mine is in the shade math p realistic
and I think it's just forged Varma I I
love these I want to get more of them
they no longer happy than my CVS the
last time I went to CVS that display was
totally taken away and they don't have
them anymore which totally bums me out
but if you haven't tried the Milani
mattel eclipse yet I think they're great
ones i have a shade from colour-pop this
is also one that was sent to me via octa
Lee it was one of their holiday lip
colors it's the ultra matte in the shade
perky so this was a part of the holiday
questions that have like the black lid
and then kind of like the frosted to
hear and shade isn't perky
and I feel like I just been raving to
everybody about the shade I became
obsessed with it I have so many
lipsticks I am a lift junkie I'm a
lipstick hoarder I'm constantly buying
new list like even when I'm like I don't
need anything but let me show this
lipstick in my bed like I don't need
them but I keep buying them and that
usually means that I am either testing a
new lipsticks out or I just want to
switch up by lipsticks and I find myself
constantly reaching for this one and I'm
like wait I can't wear the same lip
product with three videos in a row can I
think that's probably weird right I need
to switch it up but that is how much I
love it I love the color i also loved
the new ultra matte formula from
colour-pop I've been dying from
colour-pop for a very long time and
they're ultra matte formula wasn't one
of my favorites because I found it very
drying and very crumbly on the left leg
I felt like the color payoff I like that
they're only six dollars that's a great
price you can't really beat it but now
their new ultra matte formula I've
gotten this one and I have a couple
other ultramax as well newer ones from
colour-pop and they all have a new
amazing lik top-notch formula there's no
reason that a six-dollar colour-pop
ultra matte lip will not do you justice
and fit in gso great with your makeup
collection I've been super impressive
it's amazing a perky from colour-pop
it's definitely a huge favor of mine
since it was holiday I don't know if it
will be limited edition or if it's still
available but if it is I'm leaving a
link down below and make sure you pick
it up because the color pop turns over
their inventories so often so you want
to make sure you get it and then the
last one that I have to talk about is
from marc jacobs can't believe this
inside many guys but it is the sugar
sugar lip gloss it did it it got me it
got me I didn't think it would and it
did so a lot of people talking about the
Marc Jacobs lip glosses jaclyn hill
completely raised about them she's
always talking about sugar sugar and how
much she loves it and I finally broke
down I had like some sort of keep on
with Sephora and I thought okay I'm
gonna do it this is like what is it like
$28 insane for the lip glosses and I'm
like the system said I wouldn't even
want to spend that on it was what
lipstick and I'm spending it on a lip
gloss and I'm obsessed wasn't i have
this goes everywhere with me when i
travel goes with me when i'm just going
with me I like it alone i think it's
fine it's very nude so it's not my
favorite we're alone when i really love
to wear it over it's like a nude or use
brown the clip lipstick and you know it
just happened that whenever we wear any
sort of liquid lipstick it does start to
dry off the list at some point and a way
to revive it if you just put a little
bit of sugar sugar over it and it just
brings the lips back to life and I love
it or even just not for that reason just
to just wear it over top of any liquid
lipstick doesn't have to be new to nude
Brown just wearing it on top of any
lipstick just gifts the list a beautiful
glossy like plumps lips oh I just I
didn't think I was falling off that you
guys I truly did not think I would I
honestly kind of have thought of like if
it doesn't like wow me the first two
times I where I'm taking a bath like
it's so expensive and it turned into one
of my absolute favorites and if I now
take everywhere with me so there's that
I guess I was going to be everything for
