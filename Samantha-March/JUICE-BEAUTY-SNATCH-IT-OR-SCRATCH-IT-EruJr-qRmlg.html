today's video it's going to be a first
in a new series that I want to start I
wanted to start doing more review videos
on my channel and I know I've said this
in the past and then I failed at it
but I was like nope I know that I really
want to start doing it I asked my
snapchat just to make sure like would
you guys be interested and an
overwhelming majority of people said yes
I was like okay I'm going to do more
review videos focused on you know just
one product or a set of products or
something like that instead of doing
like multiple reviews in one video I
wanted to be focused on like one product
type of thing and I think what I'm gonna
do is call the series snatch it or
scratch it so when I started doing my
will I buy up videos I was asking you
know what should I call it something
else like what else should I call it and
people are kind of sending in
suggestions but I decided to keep it
just as will I buy it because that's
what I decided I wanted to do but for
the review series I really did want to
have some sort of like catchy title with
it like people have you know the dope or
dopes and the fabric fails and that sort
of thing and I'm pretty positive debit
was my friend Val who is sent in a
snapchat or scratch it and has always
been in my mind so that's what I'm gonna
call this one so each time that I'm
doing some theories reviews I'm going to
let you know do I think you should
snatch it or do I think you should
scratch it
so first up in the series is going to be
some skincare so I recently purchased
from Ulta is from juice beauty and it
was their agedefy solution set so this
is kind of what the kit looked like I
don't I don't know how to open things
nicely so I mean that's you know I don't
know I've never learned that skill so
that's just how I happen to open things
but I never tried juice Beauty before
and I really like purchasing especially
skincare in sets I mean really anything
I prefer buying sets because I like to
try out different things and even though
they come in smaller sizes a lot of
times we don't get through things
anyways it's really hard to get through
full-sized products so that's why I like
getting sets I chose the agedefy
solutions they had a few different sets
in there as well for different things
that you'd need I chose age-defy because
I'm almost
thirty and you know that's weird but
also just because I liked what was in
here more I like the actual options that
were inside so I decided to get it again
I purchased it at Ulta I'll leave it
link down below but it said it was for
brightening and correcting uneven skin
tone and so that's what I really wanted
it was $39 and it says it's a $70 value
like I said Juice Beauty I've never
tried it before I've seen a lot of
people talk about them and so when I was
purchasing from Ulta you know I needed
to spend like five more dollars for
either like free shipping or something
like that I don't remember what it was
so that's why I ended up going with this
so again what the set looks like on the
back it says it's the organic solution
to brighten and correct it says brighten
and correct with our green apple
antioxidant rich products it wasn't
supposed to decrease the appearance of
dark spots and even skin tone and
texture the kit contains a complete
regimen to cleanse treat moisturize and
activate radiant skin it says you'll get
clinically validated results in just
four weeks I have had this for probably
three weeks now and I don't think I
actually hold this on my channel I think
I just talked about it on snapchat and I
also posted a picture on Instagram but I
got a lot of questions about it and
people asking me if I would give an
update about it so I thought it would be
a good one to kick off the snapchat or
scratch it series it seems like people
tend to be very curious about skincare I
just mentioned some skincare in at my
last PR haul and I've been like
overwhelmed with requests to follow up
with that skincare so I will definitely
be doing that but inside so you have all
of your products here so you have the
green apple brightening gel cleanser and
this is in two fluid ounces so that
one's not a bad size this is the biggest
product in there and then there's also
the green apple age-defy serum and this
one is 0.25 fluid ounces so that one was
just like a little guy and they also
have the green apple age-defy
moisturizer this one is in 0.5 fluid
ounces and then you have a green apple
brightening SPF moisturizer again this
one is
five ounces and then also a green apple
peel full strength also in point five
ounces so again this was all $39 what I
was very confused about is on here where
it says it's a thirty nine dollar value
it says you get a bonus peel pad and I
don't know what that means there was
nothing else in here so I mean there was
a piece of paper explaining how to use
everything but there was no anything I
mean I even looked at the piece of paper
for a really long time like something
attached here that I'm missing
there is no bonus peel pad in here so I
don't know if that means and at first I
thought do they mean the peel is a bonus
but I don't think it would be because
the peel is listed on here you can see
the product so I don't know what a peel
pad is but that did not come in here so
immediately that kind of made me mad cuz
I was like okay like don't say I'm gonna
get a bonus product if I'm not gonna get
a bonus product so I don't that was a
little frustrating for me but to go into
it so I want to talk about each products
individually because you can obviously
purchase these products individually you
don't just have to purchase them in the
set but so the first one the brightening
gel cleanser I thought this is like a
bigger size because this is what I've
been hearing a lot of people really
liking and really using so this was kind
of like the main reason why I wanted to
buy it and this I really do like it
feels nice on the skin I do have
sensitive skin it doesn't irritate me it
hasn't broken me out or anything like
that I think it has a nice smell to it
but it feels really gentle on the skin
and I think it really helps make my skin
like look softer if that makes any sense
and but also brighten I can tell that
there is definitely a brightening effect
with this and that I appreciate I use
this every morning and every night and
I've been doing that for like I said
about three weeks now and I think that I
can definitely tell a difference in my
skin so this one I've been very happy
with and in the paper of what they say
is you do this in the morning and at
night so that's what I've been doing so
definitely the cleanser so it says this
brightening cleanser will reveal a more
refined complexion antioxidant rich
organic lemon apple and sugar cane
hydroxy
acids purifying botanicals and
plant-based cleansers exfoliate and
deeply cleanse it's excellent for sun
damage and aging skin so again this is
one that I really like I would actually
purchase this in a full-size separately
on its own this to me was definitely one
of these standouts of this set so the
brightening gel cleanser definitely got
a thumbs up for me but then like so in
the morning you use the cleanser and
then you're supposed to follow up with
the green apple age-defy serum so again
like I said this is only 0.25 fluid
ounces and this was actually a really
big disappointment for me have a pump on
it like you see I have not been able to
use the pump when I try to pump it
nothing happens and I mean I understand
like when you use something for the
first time sometimes you kind of have to
work the pump for awhile to get the
product to come out I I completely get
that but I've been trying like every
single time I go to try this which is
two days a week for the past three weeks
I still have not been able to use the
pump so I actually have to untwist it
and then you get this and then I just
have to kind of swipe it onto my hand so
that's been really frustrating I don't
understand I mean it's like you just
wonder how did this go through product
testing how is this happening am I the
only one this is happening to it just
seems weird it is kind of a thicker
serum so I get that you know the pump
makes it a little bit harder but
seriously for three weeks I still can't
get it to pump out product is really
frustrating also because of the way that
I'm having to do it I'm just not getting
a lot of product each time I'm having to
go back in like six or seven times just
to try to get some sort of serum on my
hand it's just really hard and with how
much is in there I mean I was able to
get like a decent amount for the first
about five days and then after that it's
just been a struggle so I mean I can
tell that there's still product in there
I just cannot get it out so really like
to the point now like I said I've been
doing this for three weeks to the point
now I'm really not getting any serum out
so that to me was a very big
disappointment and I really don't even
feel like I was able to give this any
sort of chance it feels nice on the skin
I don't know if I noticed anything crazy
or different from using it but again
I was pretty only able to use it about
five times and I don't know this one was
definitely a disappointment to me and I
was excited for this one because I do
like serums but just the way the
packaging is and how much is in there
it's you can't get a good amount to be
able to actually put it to the test so
that one was a disappointment okay and
then it did come with two moisturizers
and I was kind of like like that was the
only thing about this set that I was
like should I get it it has two
moisturizers like does that seem
redundant but I do love moisturizing I
do I moisturize like I don't even know
six times a day I love it but so the
first one that it comes with that you're
supposed to use in the morning is the
brightening SPF moisturizer and it's
because it has the SPF in it for you
know people outside that you're
protecting your skin but I really do not
like this moisturizer I've been using it
consistently because I wanted to keep
using it to be able to review it but I
do not like it it feels like you're
putting sunscreen on like a moisturizer
to me is something that moisturizes your
skin and like just makes you feel
revived again this feels like I'm
putting a very super thick heavy
sunscreen on my face it doesn't make my
face feel any better it's a white and so
if you don't blend it in all the way
it's legit like you've just put
sunscreen on and now you have white
streaks on your face like I do not like
this at all this one was a definite like
nono for me I get that it has SPF in it
and that's fantastic but most of my
moisturizers that I have do you have an
SPF in it and they don't leave me
feeling like I've looked and felt like
I've put on sunscreen like it was just
bizarre so this one I do not like at all
but then the moisturizer that you're
supposed to use at night is just the
green apple h25 moisturizer this one is
definitely more of like the actual
moisturizer here in my eyes it feels so
much better on the skin but again it's
nothing like I have a lot of like night
creams and things that I use that they
just you know you just feel good when
you put them on your skin you feel like
you're getting some hydration in there
is a lot of times like my night creams
especially have like some sort of like
calming scent which is supposed to be
good for when you're sleeping especially
for me like I have a lot of problems
falling asleep so some
you can get a cent on your face it can
actually help you fall asleep and this
one I mean it kind of smells like apples
to me but to me it doesn't have a huge
scent to it and it feels nice it
definitely feels a lot better than the
morning moisturizer but again nothing
that like I would rather be using my
other moisturizers and my other like
night creams and sleeping creams versus
this so again this one was just okay
definitely better to me in my eyes than
the first moisturizer but again like
just an okay product house product
that's in here is the green apple peel
the full-strength peel so this one it
says you exfoliate with our patent
best-selling potent alpha beta hydroxy
acid peel that delivers spa grade
exfoliation revealing a brighter
complexion while firming the skin and
reducing the appearance of fine lines
wrinkles and hyper pigmentation so this
is another one that's what the cleanser
was a standout product to me now with
peels I don't know if it says on here
how often you should be doing it so it
says these that you use the brightening
cleanser and then apply a generous layer
of the peel to the face leave for 10
minutes flushing and tingling are normal
that definitely did happen for me rinse
well follow what the serum and the
moisturizer it doesn't say how often
you're supposed to use this but I will
typically do peels like once a week
because peels especially how this says
it's full strength which it doesn't say
anything more what the full strength
actually means but peels can they're
typically not something that you want to
do daily because they're doing so much
to your skin and like I said like when
you put the song it was immediately like
tingling and you know having that sort
of sensation and so I have used this 3
times in 3 weeks now I've used it almost
Sunday the last three weeks and I did
exactly what it said I used it at night
I used the cleanser then I put this on
and then I did the serum and the
moisturizer this I felt like I could
definitely see a difference when I would
wake up in the morning I felt like my
skin looked better and you know we do
definitely live in like an instant
gratification and type of time where we
want to see results right away and
sometimes with skincare it can be hard
because it takes a while or you know you
have to use it consider
gently and then it still takes you a
couple weeks to be able to notice a
difference this is one that when I used
it and I would look in the bathroom the
next morning I felt like I was
definitely seeing a difference with my
skin and one of the words that I would
use to describe what my skin look like
the mornings after I use this was
youthful and that makes me real excited
so this one I'm really happy to keep
using it has the point five of fluid
ounces in here so I mean I still feel
like I have quite a bit left you don't
need to use a ton of product you just
need a thin layer over your face I can
leave it for 10 minutes don't be alarmed
if you feel like the tingling sensation
that's normal with most peels but also
when I took it off my face wasn't really
like red or irritated or anything like
that once I took it off and rinsed it
and put the serum on I mean everything
was back to normal so this one was
definitely a standout product to me like
I'm filming this on the Saturday and I'm
looking forward to using it tomorrow
night
like I'm like oh I can't wait to use
that peel like to me that means like you
found a really good product so that is
the last one but overall out of the five
products that came in the side I can
really only recommend two of them I feel
like and that is the brightening gel
cleanser and then also the full strength
peel these are really the two products
that I thought were standout products to
me that I was able to notice a
difference and that I actually just
really enjoyed using the serum just the
packaging was just weird and there's not
enough product to be able to try under
the moisturizers the one with SPF just
was not a fan of at all and the other
one was just okay in my book it wasn't
any sort of standout product to me so
these are definitely the ones that I
think are the best so overall for the
age-defy set from Juice Beauty what I
say to snatch it or scratch it I would
probably have to say to scratch it
unfortunately just because I would
probably just recommend getting these
two products on their own two other
three like I mean the therm I'm
basically done with I can't get anything
out of now that I've done the review I
really don't want to keep trying with
the SPF moisturizer because it just
makes my skin feel so icky and then the
nighttime moisturizer I would rather use
my regular ones that I know and I love
so as the said on the whole it was kind
of a disappointment for me so that's why
I'm going to say to scratch it if you
want to try out Juice Beauty these are
the two products that I definitely would
recommend I can leave these individually
linked down below as well in case you
want to check them out to buy them
separately but maybe there's a different
set that has these in there too and then
just different products that maybe you
would need to try out but unfortunately
the age-defy set from juice Beauty just
will fell short of my expectations I was
really excited to try them but I'm glad
that I did find appeal because because
that's one that I haven't really found a
lot of peels that you can use at home by
yourself so I'm glad that I found that
the cleanser you know I have a lot of
cleansers that I really love but I'm
glad that I can add in the juice Beauty
now too but yeah the agent if I said as
a whole I would have to say to scratch
it so that is going to wrap it up for my
first a snapchat or scratch it video I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this

to this series because I definitely am

scratch it on it just leave it in the
