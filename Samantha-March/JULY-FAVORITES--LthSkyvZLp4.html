today's video is going to be my July
favorite and I know we always have to
like talk about like oh my gosh the
Mokpo by so fast usually I like on the
opposite end and I'm like nope that
didn't go by very fast but for some
reason she moved at a pretty quick pace
for me even though I feel like I didn't
really do much of anything my summer has
been pretty chill so far but it's crazy
to think that August is here and falls
around the corner and I don't know what
it is I'm such a summer lover but for
some reason these last few weeks like
I've been gravitating towards the darker
lips and like the orange I shadows and I
like what's happening am i turning into
fall already this is not okay like I
still have to enjoy oddest real hard and
warm weather before it leaves us I am an
Iowa with brutal winters I'm not looking
forward to it but I think I have a
pretty good handful of stuff to talk
about for today's favorites video so
let's hop into the video and see what i
have been loving i'm not going to go in
any particular order i'm just going to
grab things as i see them but the first
one that i want to talk about is from a
Marc Jacobs beauty this is their glow
stick highlighter in spotlight I
received this in an influenster voxbox
and I was like so incredibly thrilled to
get it so this is what it looks like it
is so completely gorgeous I have been
obsessed with wearing it it's like
silver and gold highlight and it's
supposed to be like for everybody skin
tone like everybody can look good on
this highlighter and I just think it is
beautiful i love it as a cream highlight
I feel like it goes on so smoothly and I
struggle a lot with texture if you
watched my one dollar makeup challenge I
talked about after I did the highlight
challenge how bad my skin broke out and
how much texture i had from all those
powder highlights going on my face I
feel like with a cream highlighter I
don't get that texture as much like I
won't say that I don't get it at all but
it's not as bad and I just I've just
been obsessed with us especially for
summer like it gives you like a wet do
we look on the face and it is just
beautiful I believe this baby is
expensive like $42 or something I got it
from Influenster which I'm so
appreciative for and I've been talking
about it everywhere
because I just love it so another one is
an oldie and I mean I'm sure I've talked
about this in like several favorites
videos but once again I've just gotten
on a kick of not being able to stop
using this it is from Milani it is their
baked blush in luminaux so you guys
everybody loves this blush and is for
such a good reason like I'm here to tell
you guys if you do not have this blush
yet please just go get it because it is
so beautiful here's what it looks like
it's such a gorgeous like peachy bronze
and it has some shimmer in it it's just
it's so beautiful and when I bought it I
became obsessed with it and you know I
get different blushes and I try out
different blushes and I'm like okay okay
but then I just keep going back to this
one because it is so stunning we all
need luminoso so a couple new products
to talk about is from colour-pop
cosmetics and they are in the collab
with youtuber kathleenlights i have the
three lipsticks here she recently did a
collab with color pop with 38 ultra
satin lipsticks and then also with an
eyeliner i just keep forgetting to use
the eyeliner and it's making me so angry
because it looks so beautiful so I'm
sure it's going to be a favorite but I
haven't been able to test it out enough
you had to be able to put it in my
favorites but I have been wearing these
loubies like non-stop not today of
course because that's how it works but
seriously it's just because I've been
wearing them so much that I'm like I
need to wear something else on my lips
like this is getting ridiculous so the
three shades that she came out with our
Alisa November and then also point zero
I do have a full video with a live
swatches on my lips on my hands
comparison swatches and everything I
will leave that listed down below but
you also do want to check out that video
because i'm also giving away the entire
collection the three lippies and the mr.
Bing eyeliner as well in the pencil form
always open till august first which I
think this video will be up before then
but probably not for very much longer so
make sure you go get entered if you're
seeing this before August first because
you can win the collection so not only
do I love these colors so much like so
much I love them but this was the first
time that I was trying the ultra satin
formula from colour-pop cosmetics they
have the ultra matte switch
I have so many of the ultra mats and I I
like that formula I think it's good but
the ultra statins I think are even
better and now I just want to purchase
like every single ultra satin lip
because i think they are bomb so they're
a little bit different from the mat and
that they don't dry down completely and
they're not totally transfer proof but
seriously the pigmentation on these are
amazing and the lasting power is so good
I remember the first day I warned
november i went to like the movies i was
eating popcorn i think i had like a
sandwich for dinner and my lips still
looked amazing it was incredible and
they also feel so much more comfortable
on the lips than a traditional matte
lipstick because they're not as drying
so this formula is awesome if you don't
have any of the ultra satin lips from
colour-pop I say get them and if you
haven't checked out the collab with
kathleenlights definitely check out her
lippies because they are amazing so an
eyeliner i want to mention i am like an
eyeliner junkie and I got this i believe
it was in like an Ipsy bag I am pretty
sure it's from a cosmetics it's there
nope tug waterproof gel eyeliner so I
just got like a little sample guy
because it did come in an Ipsy bag and
it's basically just a regular old black
gel liner but this liner is really
incredible especially for the waterline
it stays put so well and it is so black
it's like one of the blackest liners
that I've ever used and I just think
it's beautiful I love wearing it so much
like I keep reaching forward and keep
reaching for it I need to remember to
use mr. Bing and try out mr. Bing from
colour-pop but this it cosmetics liner
when I run out I definitely wanna get
the full-size another lippy to talk
about is from Maybelline and this is one
of their new color jolts and the one
that I really have been loving is in
stripped down so I picked up two of
these so I could kind of like review
them and talk about them and it's their
color jolt intense lip paint the color
the shade that I love is 05 stripped
down I also picked up an orange one
which I do love and I love the formulas
I just like the nude a little bit better
like to say it's my favorite so I'm
really impressed with these because once
again they're like similar to like an
ultra satin lip where it's not as
drawing as a matte lip it's not transfer
proof but it is still incredibly long
lasting this was another
that I ate dinner through it and it
still looked fine I'm just I'm just
completely blown away at these it's
crazy that you can get such a
long-lasting color and such a beautiful
color and pigment on the lips and have
it still be long-lasting it's like it's
blowing my mind these are amazing these
are drugstore they're very affordable
they have not a huge color selection i
would say what they do have a pretty
good one they have some news they have
some reds and some like fuchsias and
they also have like crazier colors to
like a couple purples in there as well
but these are definitely some to check
out a foundation that I want to talk
about is one that I actually didn't
think I was going to love it I bought it
because of all the hype around it and I
know I used it as I think it did it like
a first impression in a tutorial maybe
and I was like yeah it's okay it's
nothing special and I used it a couple
more times to test it out so I could
review it like we're throughout the day
try it out with different tools that
sort of thing and then I found myself
reaching for it every single day and I
was like okay so I actually did fall in
love with it and that is the l'oreal pro
glow i bought it simply because of the
hype around it and it turned out to be
pretty bomb com I think my shade is in
2007 sand beige and honestly it's a
little light like so many people are
doing like 20 ones and 20 threes and I'm
like I'm not that tan why why am I 207
and I still don't think it's dark enough
but I don't know it's really hard to
color match at the drugstore because you
don't get a try them out but it's really
interesting about this one is that it's
super super long-lasting I mentioned it
in my review video that I did on this
one that I wore it like starting at like
nine o'clock in the morning and went
camping on the fourth of July was
outside in the elements all day and I
did take my makeup off until like one
o'clock in the morning probably and I
still thought my foundation looked fine
it's beautiful it's not streaky it's a
long-lasting it gives you your skin a
very healthy glow like I won't say it
looks like super luminous I still think
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi and the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion gives
you more of like an actual glow but this
just gives your skin a very
healthy-looking vibe and definitely a
radiant finish that's what it says on
here I think that I didn't love about it
and again I mentioned it in my review
video is that it kind of clings to dry
patches so it's supposed to be good for
people with dry skin because it gives
you that glow but if you have a lot of
dry patches
sometimes I get them like along my hair
lines and things like that it kind of
clings to those which wasn't good but
that was the only like really downfall
that I found out about this yeah I've
been reaching for it so much the l'oreal
pro glow i'm glad i bought into the hype
so a nail polish to talk about is one
from sally hansen from the miracle gel
line this is like my favorite favorite
line of nail polish and this one is in
the shade Malibu peach so this is what
it looks like this one I absolutely love
I picked it out because I've been
looking for like a good peachy nail
polish and I grabbed a few different
polishes and they turned out to be not
quite what I expect it and then I saw
this one I'm like well it says Malibu
peach like it has to be a good peachy
color am i right and I ended up being so
right I adore this color I have on I
typically wear nail heard nails they are
really easy to use like press-on nails
that stay on for an average of two weeks
my nails stay on they don't pop off
they're super comfortable and easy to
use and I do have a 10-percent discount
code with them which will be linked down
below I believe it's just Samantha March
you can get ten percent off your nails
at nail her I think each set is like ten
or twelve dollars or something like that
it's super affordable and I have worn
these particular nails which are like my
favorites these are nakey in squaw leto
like literally I love this color too
like if you can see the color I love
this color I have never painted over
these nails but naira nailed her nails
are really cool because you can paint
over them as long as it's not a design
with like a 3d or glitter on it because
you know obviously but if it's just
regular nails like this you can paint
over them which i think is really cool
and I used this with my oval nails and I
loved it I was obsessed with it usually
I changed my nail polish like every
three or four days or so i left the
malibu pee jaon for the whole two weeks
that i wore the oval nails because i'm
just obsessed with this color so again
it's Malibu peach from the sally hansen
miracle gel line this line is amazing
too for even like if you wear the nail
polish on your natural nails because
I've done that before as well and it's
super super long-lasting even without a
top coat I do have a couple top coats
that I think do help but even if you
don't have a top coat this stays on for
a super long
another foundation to talk about is from
l'oreal and it's the true Match Lumi
cushion so this is not a new product and
this has actually been mentioned in a
favorites video in the past but I had to
talk about it again because I actually
got a sample of this one in my target
beauty box like two months ago or
something and I started to use the
sample and I was like oh my gosh wait a
second why haven't I used this in a
while I have to go back to it I love
this foundation I think I love with even
more than the l'oreal pro glow just
because it gives you more of a glow like
i said then the l'oreal pro glow my
shade and this one is an N 3.5 i also
tried the sample that I got was in like
w-4 or something so it was different but
it still looked good so it's really
interesting because inside when you open
it up if you have not seen these yet you
have the foundation that is soaked onto
a cushion my favorite way to use this
foundation is with a Beauty Blender I
just think it applies so easily but the
only like downfall about these
foundations as that you're not getting a
lot of product in it so for example in
this one you're getting point 5 1 ounces
in the l'oreal pro glow you get a full
ounce the l'oreal pro glow was 1199 the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion is like
sixteen seventeen dollars which is
expensive for a drugstore foundation in
you're only getting half the product
that you would in a different l'oreal
foundation it makes no sense to me you
know I'm sure it's because it's a
cushion and it's fancy and it's blah
blah blah but seriously I kind of think
that's crap one thing that I learned
like i was using this every single day
after i got it because i loved it so
much and i could tell that the sponge
was like like I was using up all the
foundation it was getting down there and
I'm like this sucks I just thought this
i'm already almost out it's so expensive
i really do want to purchase it again
but like what do i do and i was watching
a different youtube video i believe it
was like jam beauty 89 jessica and she
mentioned that you can actually flip the
cushion over and that there's still more
foundation on the other side of the
cushion and I did exactly that it was
just like 3-4 days ago but you can just
like grab the cushion out and flip it
over and that's exactly what I did and
there definitely was more foundation on
there so now I'm like a happy camper I
got it back I can still use a bottle
foundation i'll still probably get
another one because i truly did just
this foundation so much I just wish it
wasn't so expensive last year products
to talk about one is skincare this is
another one that I got in my FC bag I
think it's like one of my first oopsie
bags and this is from n ot s it is it
says they're 28 remedy acne poured deep
cleanser so it wasn't a little sample
but I've been using this pretty
regularly and I still have quite a bit
left so it's a acne poor deep cleanser
and what I really love about this is
that I feel like it makes the skin super
clean which I feel like it's so hard to
describe like it's so hard to describe
the actual feeling of your face after
you wash it with this but I think it's
really amazing is out is like a white
gel and then it gets a little bit foamy
when you put it on the face now i do
have sensitive skin if I leave this on
too long it actually almost kind of like
it's a tingle but it's almost like a
tingle burned like I can't have this on
for very long because I can tell it's
like doing stuff to my skin but I like
the way that my skin looks after I use
it like it looks like I gave it like a
deep clean almost and the last thing
that I want to talk about is an oldie
but such a goodie oh that's from morphe
brushes and it is the 350 palette so
many people will talk about this 350
palette I didn't get it at first and it
was like each time I was trying to get
it it kept getting sold out and sold out
and then finally one day I thought it
was back in stock and I just bought it
and I am NOT regretting that decision at
all this is a beautiful palette and I
keep reaching for it there are these
gorgeous like reds and browns over here
that are so beautiful not only for fall
because sometimes I look at this palette
and I'm like that's a pretty fall
palette but really it's not there's
these beautiful shimmers and lighter
transition shades over here as well
these shimmers are absolutely gorgeous
that went to this one too these browns
are absolutely fantastic but even the
oranges like sometimes when I think
orange I think fall but that's totally
not the case orange can be very summer
as well I've just been reaching for this
palette so much for Matt looks for
shimmer looks it's just for casual looks
for glamour looks I just I can't keep
reaching for this palette I think it is
beautiful I'm so happy that I got it I
don't have the 350 shimmer or the 350
Matt they came out with like to spin off
pallets of this one one has all shimmers
one has all mats I don't have those and
I don't know if I feel like I need it
because I just love this one so much if
you don't have the 350 yet try to get it
because it is beautiful maybe everything
