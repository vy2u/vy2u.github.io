back all that good stuff today's video
is going to be my beauty and lifestyle
favorites I honestly I don't have a
whole lot going on this month I have a
few new beauty products to share with
you and then just a few random things
but nothing too crazy at all for the
month of July that I found to be my
favorite but if you would like to see
the items that I have selected please
keep watching i feel like i usually
start with beauty and then like work my
way to raid them so for this month I'm
going to start from random and work my
way back to beauty just to switch it up
keep you guys fresh the first thing I
have to talk about is shoes which to me
I found like super random but these are
my new shoes and these are nike flex
experience it says rm4 on them as well I
have no idea what that means but this is
what my new shoes look like there's
these like orange and grey and I got the
idea to mention him because I just
mentioned them in my last was in my
clothing haul video that i mentioned
that like I'm really attracted to this
color scheme right now this orange and
grey and I had like an orange and grey
shirt on I also had an orange tie up on
while I was filming the video so i
thought i would give these a shout out
because i just got him maybe like a
month and a half go two months ago and i
got him from kohls which i also
mentioned coals in my clothing haul like
how they always have awesome coupons and
discounts and things like that but
basically what was happening is once the
warm weather started happening in Iowa I
was taking my dog for walks every day
and we were going we go about three
miles every day and I had just an old
pair of tennis shoes you know my ones
from last year and they were hurting my
feet so bad to the point where like it
was rubbing a spot on my big toe in both
of the shoes and it was so painful so I
tried switching to another like an older
pair of tennis shoes that I had that I
was like oh I wonder why I stopped
wearing these tennis shoes and I started
wearing them and they were hurting like
the sides of my feet really bad like I
would I would feel like I was limping
halfway through her walk and I was
trying to walk on the sides of my feet
funny
they were hurting my feet so bad and it
just got to the point where I was like I
don't really even want to walk I don't
know what to do so I finally decided
that I just needed to suck it up and get
a new pair of shoes these are only like
sixty dollars they really weren't bad at
kohls there nike and i love them they
are super lightweight and they are just
so comfortable there's nothing that i
found that we're super fancy bottom like
you know like some of the new shoes are
you know basically say that you know
your hair is going to grow and your
fingernails are going to be stronger if
you wear their shoes and you're like
really are you telling the truth these I
didn't find that they you know said that
they were going to change my whole
entire world they were just good walking
shoes so I'm really liking these nike
shoes since i mentioned my clothing haul
this is actually one of the taps that i
mentioned in there that i got from tap
loft was like the gray the one with the
zippers in the front and the back and
i'm wearing it today and i also got a
lot of questions on what i was wearing
in that video it was like the blue in
the orange top and what it was it was
actually a romper it was a strapless
romper and with shorts it wasn't like a
long romper or anything and it was from
topple off clothing as well so clearly
really like that store just one other
really random thing to mention is
audible so since I've also started
walking my dog I have found myself
becoming like kind of bored when we're
on our walks and I would just call my
mom a lot most days and finally she was
like we talk every single day for like
40 minutes a day like I don't really
have anything else to say to you since I
just said everything to yesterday I'm
like I need something else to do
sometimes I'll walk with friends and
things like that but most of the time
what I've been doing now is really
getting into audio books and I get all
my audio books through audible com right
now I am listening to the best of
enemies jen lancaster and it is so funny
i am finding myself like trying to walk
aries more throughout the day and we're
taking longer walks during our time
together because this book is so good
that i just don't want to stop listening
to it and this is my third audio book
i've done summer secrets by jane green
and also things you won't be things you
won't say by sarah peeking in on audio
is while
and it's just so great it's something to
occupy my time while we walk so I feel
like I can walk longer and just walk
more and get outside more and exercise
more and i'm not being bored at all but
it's such a fun way to be able to listen
to book and even when i take a long car
rides i can listen to the audio book
instead of like listening to the radio
and zoning out and I just I'm really
enjoying it most of the books with
marching ink with my publishing company
has audio book so I've been able to kind
of see how the audiobook process is when
we did the audio books for those titles
and it's a lot of fun I think it does
benefit authors so I think it's amazing
i will put a link to audible below I
think there's some sort of special I
think like when I signed up for audible
I've got like two free audio books or
something like that and then you can get
a membership you can pay each month it
but it's and you get one audio book a
month with that and it's cheaper than if
you would just like purchase a la carte
audiobooks each month but it just
depends you know do you want an
audiobook every month do you want an
audio book twice a year you know they
have different options for what it is
that you need be i'll post the links
audible below i have found them to be
really user friendly I mean I'm sure you
can put them on devices like iPads and
things like that but what I do is I just
download them directly to my phone and i
plug my earphones into my phone and we
walk that way i have my pedometer app
going on my phone so i know how far
we're walking and then i have the audio
book as well so it just it's worked out
really well for me and I've been really
enjoying listening to my belt okay and
now let's get into beauty the first
thing that I want to talk about is the
shade + light eye palette and this is
from kat von d and i mentioned this in
my latest Sephora haul and i was so
excited to use it i also did ask you
guys if you wanted to see a more
in-depth like one-on-one full review of
the tutorial or of the palette and then
plus do a makeup tutorial for you and
i've been hearing yes so thank you so
much for everyone who has commented and
snapped me and told me yes because i'm
super excited if you guys want to give
me an idea of what sort of tutorial you
want to see like if you want something
with the dark colors a smoky eye maybe a
more
I if you want me to use any of the
specific shades just please do comment
below and let me know what the palette
looks like these are all the colors and
then on the back there is also this
large mirror which is really nice but so
these are all the colors and I don't
know if you guys will be able to pick it
up on camera but I have been loving hard
on this palette I use it nearly every
single time I've done at my makeup these
past like two weeks since i've had this
i have used this palette i've been
experimenting with all the different
shades I've been trying out the
different quads I've just been totally
totally loving hard on this palette the
only thing I will say it's kind of like
dusty I just watched Jacqueline Hills
July favorites video and she also
mentions the shade and light palette
which I was like cool got it too but the
word that I'm pretty sure she used was
dusty meaning that when you put your
brush in one of the shades and you kind
of swirl it around to get product on
your brush it transfers and picks up a
lot of the products so I'm constantly
having like if you saw me just do
earlier having to like blow up the
palette because so much product gets
around here and I remember the day that
I was experimenting with like this
really dark well it's black those black
shade and I blew the palette and the
black one everywhere and it went all
over my sink and I ended up having to
legit clean my sink after that happened
because there was just product
everywhere that's the only part I don't
love but other than that all these
colors are really pigmented and they're
really easy to blend and I just think
they're really pretty colors I know
looking at it some people might not
think there's like a huge array or
selection of colors but honestly once
you get into it and start like fiddling
around with the colors and the
combinations you can really do a lot of
looks with it like today my look is so
super basic I have this middle color up
here as my like transition crease color
and then i have this peachy color all
over the lid i also popped i think it
was which one this one kind of like more
in the corner of my eye and also as my
brow highlight and that was it I smudged
out this very first color
and this gray color in my lower
waterline and that was it I really
didn't want to put a lot of emphasis on
my makeup today so i just did not even
that bold of an eyeliner for me so i
just did did an eyeliner and then a more
bolder lip color claire is fig from the
melted to face lines that I have on
right now and on camera it kind of picks
up Morris like a pinkish purple like I
don't see a lot of purple when I wear
this on camera but in person it looks a
lot more purple anyways so yes I'm
really loving this palette I'm so
excited to do the full tutorial for you
on us watch all the colors for you so
you can see it and then also do the
makeup application on camera so yes
please comment below or find me on
social media or send me a snapchat or
whatever you have to do to tell me what
kind of tutorial you want to see and
this will be coming in august and then
the next thing also from my Sephora haul
but I want to mention as a favorite that
should be no surprise to anybody on here
is the Beca champagne pop highlighter so
this is the highlighter that youtuber
jaclyn hill created with becca cosmetics
and it is sold at sephora so it is
called their shimmering skin Perfector
and this is in the champagne pop so this
is what Jacqueline Hill did as a
collaboration with Becca and it is such
a freaking beautiful highlighter it's
just like not even funny so this is what
the highlighter looks like and if you
can see that on my skin it's just this
really beautiful like I think the name
fits its so well it's like peachy
champagne II it's shimmery it's so
beautiful it's what I have on today if
you guys can see that on my cheekbones I
have been so like so obsessed with this
highlighter declan Hills video when she
talked about the champagne pop release
and she was doing like how to put it on
she was like you put it on your
cheekbones and then if you want you can
put him on your forehead and your chin
and your nose and maybe above your
eyebrows I'm how about on your shoulders
and then on your collarbones and she was
like drenching ourself and champagne pop
and I was like okay that's kind of silly
but she's probably really into it not if
I have
self doing the same thing I found myself
putting it on my collarbone when we went
out we were just gonna spend like a day
outdoors and this nice weather and I was
like I want to look all glowy to I was
putting it on my shoulders I'm like okay
you're getting out of control but that
is just how much i love it i think it is
so so beautiful so again this is the
champagne pop from becca cosmetics i
don't know if you can get this essa for
it anymore i mean if you can if it's
still out there if you see it at your
stores get it because i believe this is
a limited edition so once they're gone
they're gone and I feel like you just
need it so just a few things left to
talk about what I also want to give a
mention too is this too faced chocolate
soleil medium deep matte bronzer I have
just a little sample size so that's what
the shade looks like I can swatch it as
well so that's what it looks like on my
finger my husband is just getting home
so I'm going to try to get this fast I
don't know if you'll be able to see it
on my hand but this is the bronzer these
two are both champagne pop I i swatched
it twice loving this bronzer it smells
like cocoa it's delicious I love it I've
been finding myself wearing it almost
every single day over my next bronzer
matte bronzer that I had been using and
especially paired with the Maybelline
better skin foundation that I just
received from Influenster it it like
matches perfectly with it it's so
bizarre to me but I've been using this
almost every single day exclusively so
that's the too faced chocolate soleil
bronzer okay the next one I want to talk
about is the eyeliner that I got and I
just mentioned this in my most recent
haul too so it's kind of like a fall ill
follow up video of everything but this
is the Maybelline master graphic
eyeliner and it is the one that looks
like a crazy marker so that's kind of
what it looks like no let's let's watch
that a little bit better so that's kind
of what it looks like thin line there's
this like thick line you can do I don't
know now i'm just getting wild with my
swatches wearing it today and
I have pretty much worn this every
single day versus my Maybelline gel
eyeliner that I have that I had been
using a lot this is pretty much replaced
it it is so easy to put on it is so
smooth on the eyes and it dries so black
and matte I just i'm absolutely in love
with it especially this like fine tip
point makes it so easy to create a wing
which I don't have a wing today of
course but it's just with making my
eyeliner application so much easier to
do I've been wearing this almost
everyday I do it with more dramatic
looks I do it was simpler looks like
today's look is so simple but I still
reached for the eyeliner and it's like
my go-to eyeliner i think it was like
seven dollars ulta so good purchase I
have to talk about as a brush and I you
don't feel like I've really talked about
brushes a lot but I have been reaching
for this one a lot and this is from
Sephora and it's a concealer brush it
says it is their pro airbrush concealer
number 57 so if you can kind of see what
the top looks like but what I've been
using this for is days where I don't
have a lot of makeup on and I don't do
like the full highlight of my face where
I don't put the concealer all over my
eyes and like make that triangle shape
under my eyes I don't have like the
concealer to highlight my forehead the
bridge of my nose my Cupid's bow my chin
and all that stuff because then I would
use my beauty blender to blend that out
so i've been using this on the days
where I just want to kind of conceal the
Dark under eyes and I've been using my
Maybelline like the instant age rewind I
believe it is but and I put the
concealer just like right here on my
under eyes and then I just take this
brush and I blend it out and it's really
easy to like get up under there under
your lower lash line and I mean this is
probably about as far as I take it when
I'm doing that technique and then i
still bring it up but i've been loving
this brush for it it's so handy it was
so easy to use I can't exactly remember
the price now because it was a while ago
that i bought this and honestly i didn't
use it a whole lot but now that I've
been doing makeup more and I've been
finding good concealers to use for under
my eyes I've been reaching for it a lot
more
so wanted to mention it they just two
more things the next one I have also
from my Sephora and alcohol if I talked
about everything that i got and that
Hall because I think everything really
worked out did you guys see that fly
we've had that fly in our house for like
four days it won't get out I raise keeps
trying to eat it and she hasn't gotten
it yet and I kind of hope she just kills
it one of these days the Too Faced
better than sex mascara if you watched
my video on the lash stash to go which
had the five mascaras in it I was able
to pick my favorite mascara out of those
fives they were like all many sizes I
was able to pick my favorite and then I
was given a mascara voucher you take
that voucher to a sephora and you can
redeem it for a full size of your
favorite mascara so obviously I have to
include this in my favorites video
because it was my favorite out of the
bunch so again this is the Too Faced
better than sex mascara this is what the
wand looks like it's humongous it's huge
it makes your lashes full and thick and
longer and gives them so much volume I
just I absolutely love it it was between
this and the tart lights camera flashes
that I was choosing between in that lash
dash to go video but the better than sex
it just a totally one so got my full
size of it and I'm super happy about it
very last thing I have to talk about
it's kind of random maybe I should I put
this before all the other beauty items
but it's actually a perfume and the
bottles really dirty for whatever reason
but this is the gucci guilty intense
sorry if it's going to like glare anyone
out but that's the packaging is so super
cute gold packaging and then when you
take the lid off it looks like this and
I don't know how to describe the Sun I
feel like it's a more mature sent if
that makes sense and it's kind of like
deeper in I don't how do you describe
perfumes on camera this is the first
time I'm doing it and absolutely love it
and I wanted to mention it because when
I wear it I get so many compliments I
was just out of wedding and a random
person totally random man walked up to
me and he goes I just have to ask what
perfume are you wearing because when you
walked by earlier
could smell it and I thought it smelled
really good and I was like oh it's Gucci
intense it was just so and he was like
okay thanks and walked away I was like
alright see you later have had it for
how long have I had this I got this as a
gift from an author actually and I can't
remember when she sent it to me maybe
six months ago but if you can see the
liquid I'm like down here so I love it
and I find myself reaching for it a lot
so that is Gucci intense so those are
all my beauty and my sale favorites for
