today's video I'm going to be going over
my July if see glam bag and just kind of
talking to you is about what I have felt
about my it's the subscription I wasn't
sure if I was going to do this video but
I thought it was about three months back
I first signed up for it see and got my
FC glam bag and i did a video on here
and I was like applying the products and
i was saying hey I'm gonna get this big
every month and I'll do a video every
month and put the products on my face
and give you guys my first impressions
and I never did a video besides that
first video so I'm going to kind of
explain myself on here and just talk
about my feelings of ypsi in general and
yeah so kind of a little bit of a
different video I wasn't sure if I was
actually gonna film it cuz i was like
i'm not sure if anyone like truly cares
but i was talking about this on my
snapchat this morning actually and like
seriously so many people were responding
back to me and talking to me about like
their glam bags and some of their other
subscription bags and boxes and things
like that so I was like since the
response was so high there I decided to
just make a video and kind of go over a
few things that I thought with my Ipsy
subscription you guys would like to see
my thoughts and hear why I've actually
decided to cancel my Ipsy glam bag
subscription please keep watching so I
can go through my July glam bag first so
all the Ipsy bags come in this like
shiny pink material so you know your
etsy glam bag is coming yeah i did my
first if see glam bag I like I mentioned
here was like a full dedicated video to
it and I used up all the products most
of the products on my face on it and
then I think I mentioned one other one
during like a big makeup Allah just kind
of slid it in there as well cuz I was
like me and I don't think I can do a
full video about this and then I haven't
done another one since this is going to
be my second and my last it's a video
that makes any sense but each bag also
comes with a card that has like some
sort of theme on it so the theme this
month is hot summer nights actual glam
bag looks like this it's kind of like
fun and metallic has has some cuteness
on the cover it's nice that you get a
bag each month even though I really
don't need the
my name bags and actually last month I
gave one of the bags of wax I was like I
just don't need these this money like
makeup bags but it is nice especially
for traveling it's nice they're all like
pretty small and compact Oh opening it
up one of the things that words in here
was the trace stick and it is a mini
highlight stick so this is what it looks
like and at first I was like that's kind
of weird is that that's not the actual
product right but of course it's not but
if you open it up this is what the
actual product that looks like and now
I'm not actually going to watch it
because I'm not sure if I'm going to
keep it highlight stick I feel like
could be pretty cool to have but i'm not
sure i might be giving this one away but
so i got a mini highlight stick so also
in there was a model co power lash black
mascara so it looks like this so just
like a deluxe eyes mascara I have so
many different mascaras and I get a lot
of like deluxe mascara send to me as
well so i probably wouldn't keep this
either this would probably go in a
future giveaway also in here was a brush
from luck see this is there to 15 small
angle brush this really excited me
because I don't have any luck see
brushes and I've always wanted to try
them out small angled brush I have quite
a few small angled brushes but still I'm
still like okay I'm going to keep this
leg at this I know I'm going to keep
this because I'm excited to try out
Lexie brushes and small angled brush you
know yeah why not so I'm going to keep
this so also in there was a not soap
radio joy inducing hand and body lotion
I thought this was really cute packaging
there's like a fun it says on the front
says when life gives you one too many
lemonade's and you've misplaced your
happy place this is their joy inducing
handed body lotion so cute I mean I like
these little like travel-size of lotions
because they're easy to travel with or
just throw in your bag but not something
that I'm like yes ooh mega score you
know and then the final thing in here I
pulled it out and I was like oh cool
it's from the bomb cosmetics and I
really like the bomb and their higher
end brands I was like that's really cool
and it's one of their meat matrimony
matte eyeshadows and i'm not sure what
color it's an OS in matte Moskowitz I
have no idea but this is the eye
hello and I don't know I mean that's
just like the tiniest little eye shadow
I think I've ever seen I pulled it out I
was like okay alrighty then so got this
like little baby eye shadow and the
color is like a deep like purple that
one that I feel like I would really wire
too often so I was like well I'll
probably keep that for a giveaway as
well so out of my five products of the
bag I'm only keeping one last month I
don't think I kept any the month before
that I think I kept one and then the
first bike I kept them all because I
actually put them all on my face and
then I was like I shouldn't have done
that because I didn't actually like the
lipstick but I put it on I put on the
eyeshadow then I was like me and I can't
even give these away now but I've just
found what the like four months that
I've been signed up with FC I'm not
really keeping anything from my ipsy
glam bags like I'm just putting them and
giveaways and like giving things to
friends and I'm like okay I know that
it's only ten dollars a month but is
this worth it or not so this morning
when I went over it on my snapchat and I
went through everything that I got and I
was like me and you guys you know I just
I'm not keeping anything from these bags
like is it really worth it for me to
keep getting them because it's not even
like I'm excited anymore like I'm like
oh my i see clear bags almost here like
oh okay like oh good i'll see what's
gonna be in my night giveaway and like
that's great and i just think that
there's so many different like
subscription boxes out there for beauty
and i just recently picked up the target
beauty box that came out and it was ten
dollars i believe and it was filled to
the brim with so many amazing products
like that was a seriously awesome beauty
box and i was going to get it the last
month that it came out but i was like i
haven't even gone through everything in
the first box yet like maybe i'll do the
next month one because i'm still trying
to get through everything in that box
and so when i compare that to spending
ten dollars on an Ipsy bag for products
that i'm not even using am I
me and you know I just don't think this
is going to be worth it and just some of
the products like especially the bomb
one that I showed you guys they're just
so small and there's other subscription
boxes that are giving you like deluxe
sized samples or even full-size of
products and like I just feel like my
money could be better spent somewhere
else and that was what a lot of the
snaps back to me we're saying like you
guys have been disappointed with your
eggs as well or the products are just so
small or just doesn't seem worth it or
it's not matching up with us and I keep
going in and like retaking the quiz on
ypsi because there's like there's like
the beauty quiz that you can take and
they're trying to like get to know your
preferences you know you can say I like
eyeliners I like highlighters I like
whatever it is that you like you can say
like what colors you like what brands
you tend to gravitate towards and I
still I don't feel like I'm ever getting
that in my bag and I'm like I don't know
I don't want to keep retaking this quiz
every month because I don't feel like
it's actually helping me and it's still
frustrating and it was just interesting
this month because I started seeing a
lot of people say that they like looked
early like I'm one of those that like I
don't like to look and see what's in my
bag early because I love like the
element of surprise of pulling things
out but so many people are like oh my
gosh i'm getting the two-faced hangover
primer and like come on to face hangover
primer I've wanted that for so long and
it looked like it was a good like I
don't know for sure but from what I was
seeing on people's bags that look like
it was like a deluxe size like good size
sample of it and I had my fingers
crossed so bad for it so when I didn't
get it I was like not really think and I
went on fc's website and each month I
think they have like super star products
and it's usually products from like a
more higher-end well-known brand and
each bag will have one of these products
in there and the superstars were of
course the two face primer there was a
bare minerals lipstick that I was like
man I would have been so happy with that
there was I think was a makeup forever
mascara and then there was the tiny
little the bomb eyeshadows and I'm like
why did I get I shadow
like I shadows are not something that
like super excites me because i have so
many I shadow pellets like I like
eyeliners and I like highlighters and
I'm not sure why I got like a hand
lotion either that doesn't make a lot of
sense to me because I I've never
collected that I'm interested in hand
lotion like I would rather get like
something for my hair for my skin so I
don't know guys it just I don't feel
like we were a good match and I actually
wanted to cancel last month after I got
my bag and I was like you know what nope
I'm gonna wait one more month and I feel
like so many people do this to like I'm
gonna wait one more month and I'm going
to see what next month's is like and
then once I started seeing the two face
I was like oh come on I know like this
has to be a good bag and then this
month's bag came when I was like shoot
so I actually did I went ahead and
cancelled my subscription and I put
right on there they ask you why you're
canceling and I put because the products
are so small and also that I didn't feel
like they were matching with what i
wanted so i did go ahead and cancel and
I feel bad about it and I'm sad about it
because it was fun to get a beauty bag
every month it really was fun but even
at only ten dollars a month like I can
put that somewhere else I can look into
getting a different subscription box I
can just get the target box every month
if I want but i have decided and i have
done it if she has been cancelled so i'm
sorry that there was only one truly
dedicated video to ypsi but that's why I
wanted to come on here to say like I
feel weird that I have that video out
there like I'm going to do these every
month and then I never posted again but
now you guys know that reason and you
know why and it's I mean I'm not trying
to like be rude or say anything bad
about it see because I love what they're
doing and so many people really do love
their bags but unfortunately we just did
not work out I had a different
subscription box in the past as well and
i ended up canceling it to sell I don't
know maybe i'll get another one in the
future a lot of people are saying boxy
charm is a good one I think it's 21
dollars a month which is a little bit
more expensive but people will say you
actually get like full-size products in
there and just a little bit better stuff
in there like I saw I think it was this
month that you guys got like 60 for
eyeshadows or something and a whole
metallic pal
that they came in like that's amazing to
me that's for $21 on its own so I
definitely want to look into boxy charm
but if you guys have any other
subscription boxes that you get and you
feel are really good please do leave
them in the comments below because I did
want to have some sort of monthly
unboxing on here with you guys and
that's why I got the Ipsy it just ended
up not working out so if there's any
other subscription boxes that you guys
can recommend to me please do let me
know because in the next couple months
here I would like to get started with
another one so yes please do leave your
recommendations below or if you guys
have had if see or you have it seen now
and it just didn't work out for you
either if you guys want to let me know
and like let me know why I didn't work
for you if we had kind of the same
experiences too I just love to hear your
guys's feedback and really it was
because so many people were talking to
me on snapchat about this that that's
why I decided to make the video and just
kind of explain myself to so there will
be no other if see unboxings in the
future and I'm sorry about that but
hopefully I'll get a new subscription
box in the near future here and we can
start doing a boxing's together for
those but there's somebody out there and
I will find the one that is right for me
I just know I well but then it's going
to be it for this video guys i just
wanted to go through my last glam bag
with you and explain my reasonings for
cancelling FC and i hope you guys
enjoyed this video or found it
entertaining or helpful or something but
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you will give this a thumbs up if
you enjoyed it please do subscribe
