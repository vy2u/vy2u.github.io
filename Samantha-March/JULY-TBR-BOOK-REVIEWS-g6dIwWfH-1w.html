video is going to be book reviews and I
realized that I've been totally slacking
I'm sharing my reviews with you review
video i did was my june reading list
wrap up and so I didn't apparently I
just don't post anything for july
because you know that's what i did have
a lot of books to talk about i'm not
sure how many i'm going to get through
i'm just going to start from where i
left off from June's video and see how
many I can fit in so probably not going
to go into a whole lot of depth into
each review just because I want to get
as many out there as i can to share with
you guys but all of my full reviews are
on chocolate plus their amazon links
will be below to every book I talk about
plus the review link to Chiclets plus if
you want to check them out if any catch
your eye so if you would like to see my
very late book review video for my July
read bub maybe in august probably just
going to be july but you just keep on
watching it the first one I have to talk
about is cocktails at Lake Armand and
this is by Isabel and over and this one
I really liked it because I love books
that are set and like Paris and that
sort of thing I don't know for some
reason they just give me more of like a
chiclet field when we have that going on
and that's exactly what this one was
about it was also i read it so fast i
remember i was getting ready to go on a
vacation when i started reading this
book and I thought this is going to be
the perfect vacation read I started
reading it before we left and I had it
done in like two days so I actually
didn't even get to take it on vacation
with me because it read so quickly so i
ended up really really enjoying it my
surface is trying to restart itself no
we are just starting this video give me
a little bit of time Rick summer read I
know we're getting to the end of summer
but if you're still lookin for some
Chiclets to add to your collection go
check this one out okay the next one
that I reviewed was the knockoff by Lucy
Sykes and Joe Piazza I won't get into
this one too much because I did mention
it in my July book favorites video I'm
fairly positive so I will go ahead and
link that one below instead but
absolutely loved it I mean five stars
all the way
they recommend it for Chiclets for
women's fiction if you're a fan of
something like the devil wears prada
this one is being cleaned is being
really similar to that and I just
hands-down loved it and the next one I
have is summer secrets and this is by
Jane green I obviously do have the
hardcover copy but I actually read this
one or I listened to it in the audiobook
version and Jane herself the author
herself was the numerator for the audio
book which I thought was really
interesting like to read audio books
because I go on long walks with my dog
every day and it just gives me something
to be able to do instead of just like
blankly staring while we do our walk so
I'm really enjoying listening to the
audio books recently I think I mentioned
them in my last like lifestyle favorites
video how much i'm absolutely enjoying
listening to the audio books for summer
secrets i enjoyed it you can tell by the
hardcover that it's I mean slightly a
bigger book it's nothing huge like the
Jackie Collins his books that I read but
the beginning for me started out pretty
slow and then it seemed like once we got
to really exciting parts or parts that
made me read the book really fast the
novel sudden it would change directions
really fast and it would slow down again
with audio books I only listen to them
when we're taking our walks so it's not
like I just be around the house and like
pick up a book and start reading with
audio books I don't just pick it up and
start listening I only listen to it on
our walks but I found myself like having
trouble getting excited to be able to
listen to it especially when it was in
our solar moments and I'm just like
what's going on and why do we need to
know all this backstory and things like
that because the actual meat of the
story I thought was really good and was
exciting and you know all that good
stuff but then it just we had so much
backstory and I just felt like those
parts weren't exactly needed and didn't
help move the story forward or make it
go faster so I was kind of like on the
fence about this one I'm leaning towards
that I liked it because I thought the
actual story was really good the writing
was really good and I enjoyed the
narration of the audiobook just wish it
would have been a little bit quicker of
a read the next one I have is the art of
adapting and this is by Cassandra done
and I mentioned in my review I was so
excited to read this one because
Cassandra and I actually met via social
media we have the same breed of dog we
both have villas and that's actually
what this little dog on the cover is is
a beach love the paperback print is a
totally different cover then the
hardcover copy is and it features a
visual on there as well which I just
absolutely loved fish laws have a very
small role in the book as well but it
was a big reason when we connected
online and she asked if she could send
me her book I said yes because I was so
excited to be able to read something
that had a visual feature didn't because
it's not a very common braid so you
don't hear about that a lot and of
course it has a special place in my
heart it was a really good book this is
Cassandra's debut novel and I was
totally impressed with it being a debut
like I didn't was so good and so
thoughtful and so thought-provoking and
I was just so impressed that this was a
debut novel I just thought it was
absolutely amazing you get a lot of
different point of views and I liked
that we got all those point of views
like we get several characters povs
which I thought was interesting but
sometimes I also felt like it kind of
slowed the story down a little bit so it
was kind of weird because at the same
time I appreciated it and I got why we
were getting all the different povs but
then at the same time I felt like maybe
if we didn't have that much going on it
would have been a faster book so again
almost kind of like with the gene green
one I just wish it would have been
faster paced especially because I did
have the hard copy book and it's so hard
for me to read physical editions no
matter how much i love paperbacks or
hardcover copies it's so hard for me to
read because it's not as easily
accessible to read as versus like my
Kindle or my phone so especially when I
read something in the physical form of
it I hope they're fast reads and this
one wasn't super quick but very thought
provoking and very well written so I did
highly enjoy it though I think I gave it
four stars on chocolate plus I have is
the broken road and this is by Melissa
Huey and this was like a romantic
suspense novel and i will say that
there's a lot of action in this book I
mean really from
not the first page but from the
beginning of the book there's a lot of
action it's very fast-paced there's a
lot going on it was very quick to read
just because it read so quickly there is
a lot of suspense going on there's a lot
of mystery happening and of course
there's also a lot of romance going on
the book that's why it's a romantic
suspense book I did feel like the
mystery and the suspense and that sort
of thing did you guys just hear that a
car just like peeled out I mean we live
in like small town suburbs there's no
reason for that to be happening are you
kidding me geez anyways come all
flustered now that's scared me I don't
know you guys in here that we have like
all of our windows and all of our doors
open so it's a really nice day for once
here in Iowa so we're like airing out
pal sams I felt like the suspense of the
mystery angle it was almost like I don't
know if I want to say it was too much
but sometimes it just seemed like it was
all too planned out you knew what was
gonna happen next you know that sort of
thing but nothing that really detracted
my enjoyment of reading the book I still
had a really good time reading it and it
was a lot of fun I believe I give it
another four star review on chiclet plus
oh yeah enjoyed it this one I have is
the patrons and this is by daniela
Brodsky and i think i mentioned this in
when I feature this in a haul video that
I was really looking forward to reading
this because I've read Daniela's books
before she's written was a diary of a
working girl and I got turned into like
a Lifetime movie featuring um i was
gonna say Lizzie McGuire featuring
Hilary Duff hello I've really enjoyed
liked her tour chiclet books this one
was more of a women's fiction which I've
also read that from her but this one was
definitely more serious and you know had
more of a mature subject line and I I
gave it three stars on Chiclets plus
because I had such a hard time
connecting with the main character I
just could not get the vibe going with
her I don't I don't know I just
struggled a lot I mean yes we are in
different places in our lives but you
know I read every go plethora books I
read books about moms about grandmothers
about you know people who live in
different countries than me and you know
I i read yai read about people that are
a lot younger than me and you know
sometimes it really doesn't have to do
if our lives are parallel to each other
just sometimes I just can't connect with
the main character and unfortunately
that is what happened in this one and it
really ended up hindering my reading
experience I had a hard time getting
through the book I wasn't excited to
pick it up I the plot and the storyline
is very interesting was also one of like
the big subplots was politics in the two
thousand eight election and that kind of
was getting interspersed throughout the
way and I didn't really quite understand
why we were getting that either that
made the story like for me so personally
it wasn't my favorite book which I was
really bummed about because I really do
enjoy Daniela in her books but this one
just wasn't wasn't for me I hate when
that happens next one is never ending
beginnings and this is by Mary Chris
Escobar and this one I had so much fun
reading it basically the main character
it's kind of like Groundhog's Day the
main character keeps repeating a certain
week in her life and certain events that
are going on it kind of revolves around
a friend's wedding her friends is
getting married to actually her
ex-boyfriend so there's kind of like a
weird situation happening there there's
some romance throughout and there we
also have a great subplot with her with
the main characters mother who was
passed away but I mean basically the
book is just like on repeat I mean we
were getting the same week of her life
over and over again and it's interesting
to see why she thinks it's happening
what she tries to do about it the little
changes that she tries to make along the
way I i don't know i love these kind of
books i had so much fun reading it I
gave up 4.5 stars on Chiclets plus and I
just had a great time reading this book
and seeing how she was going to get
through her time on repeat and another
one I have is the cake therapist and
this is by Judith fertig and again I
won't go into a whole lot of detail
because here comes my dog can you hear
her because I gave it five stars so I
did mention it in my
my favorites video which again will be
linked below and but I mean it seriously
how cute is this cover how cute is the
back cover the book is so fabulous and
it has that little bit of the magical
realism that I've talked about on here
that I love so much that's included in
there as well in a really fun and
creative way and i ended up absolutely
loving the cake therapist this one is
the trouble with dying and this is by
maggie LePage and I remember when I
mentioned this in my haul video I was
reading the blurb out loud and I started
laughing because it sounded so funny to
me I mean it follows the main character
is in a coma most of the time and she's
you know watching herself from above
she's watching the interactions with her
family in there and she's trying she
doesn't remember what happened she
doesn't remember the accident that she
got into or what happened or why it
happened there's thoughts you know
people are saying that it was possible
suicide she's trying to figure out what
she really so down that she wanted to
take her own life but at the same time
so that's all very serious stuff at the
same time it has a total Chiclets vibe
and it's funny at times and when I was
reading the blair balls like okay I'm
conflicted because this sounds really
serious but then it sounds really funny
at the same time like how can this be
and I thought the two together they
worked so well Meggie LePage did such a
fantastic job writing this I had to
blast reading it I love the mystery
because I really had no idea what
happened I didn't think she killed
herself but I couldn't figure out who
did and there was a lot of people that I
was kind of looking at like hmm maybe so
and then there's you know of course the
twist is thrown in there as well oh my
gosh it was so good I really enjoyed it
and another one that I really really
recommend especially for summertime I
think it's such a good summer read so
hurry fast i know i'm cutting it close
that i'm recommending summer reads still
the google though i somehow was able to
get through all of july and i was
actually going to keep going and get
into august and then my surface decided
to die okay so that ended it for me
because i won't be able to show you and
you've the other covers but i really
hope you enjoyed the books that i
mentioned i had no idea how many i
managed to get through but i hope you
find someone there for your reading list

the amazon links plus the links to my
reviews on tikl applause will be on the
box below if you want to check it
I'll also be sure to link my July book
favorites video since I mentioned a few
of the titles in that one so you can see
what I said a bottom two in what books I
loved in the month of July it is so
crazy to me that we are almost at the
note we are r at the end of August I
mean we're almost in September that is
so wild that's so wild and a fellow

there's so many exciting things going on

tember seventh I mean all kinds of good
things going on yes please do give this
video a thumbs up if you liked seeing
the book reviews please comment below if
you saw any that you know that you're
going to be putting on your reading list
or if you've read any of the books I
would love to hear some of your feedback
on them to mention this on social media
and I wanted to throw it up third to
like usually when I do these review
videos i'm doing a good chunk of books
all at once so I'm not really going into
a lot of depth with them I'm just kind
of giving like my brief overall yes or
no you know type of feedback but I
wondered if like for some books if you
guys would want me to do just that book
and review video so i can actually go
into more detail of it and i just
listened to the best of enemies by jen
lancaster and i know that was a pretty
popular book coming out jen lancaster
you know it was a pretty loved author
and she writes fiction and nonfiction
the best of enemies was fiction which i
know and myself included some of us tend
to gravitate more towards but i actually
ended up really really loving this book
and so I thought maybe I could do a
review video just on that and like
really break it down for you guys to let
you know what I thought what I thought
was good and bad about it if I think you
should get it who I think would enjoy it
you know that type of thing what I heard
on social media especially on my
Facebook page is that you guys would
want to see something like that so I
wanted to bring it up to you guys here
on youtube so please comment below if
you think you'd like me to start doing
that if there's any books that you think
you want me to highlight and that sort
of thing like i said i'm thinking of
starting with Jen's book just cuz it's
so fresh in my mind I just got done
listening to it loved it you know that
sort of thing and I know it's one that
was kind of highly talked about so
thought that would be a good place to
start but if there's anything else that
you guys could think of please just let
me know before you leave
and I will just see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
