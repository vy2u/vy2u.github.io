I'm going to be going over at the July
book favorites we had four Chiclets plus
so this is all the books reviewed either
by myself or someone on my review team
that we gave 5 stars2 maybe seven seven
or eight books that we have that got
five stars in July so if you would like
to see our book favorites for the month
please keep watching the first one that
i have is things you won't say and this
one i have mentioned in several other
videos is probably like three videos now
that i talked about this book but i just
loved it so much and i felt like it was
just a really powerful read it covers
the topic of a white police officer
shooting and killing a hispanic teenage
boy that is like the focal point of the
book we get an inside look at the family
of the cop and what they go through we
also do get a glimpse into the life of
the mother of the boy who was shot and
killed and also his kind of family life
a little bit on his background but it
was just such a good read sara is one of
like my favorite authors i have not
missed a book by her yet and I always
know that we're going to get a really
good book when she comes out with a new
title so I listened to this as an
audiobook and it was awesome to listen
to and I thought it was interesting
because Sara put out there that the
narrator of the book was a wife of a
police officer who was basically in the
same situation her husband was involved
in a shooting of a teenager so that kind
of like amped it up a little bit to read
as the audiobook as usual all the books
will be linked below in the description
box the Amazon link and the review on
chocolate plus will be down below the
next one that got five stars is down the
aisle with bridezilla and this is why
Carly Palmer and Annie reviewed this one
she said it was funny it was
entertaining she said she devoured the
book she said it was the perfect summer
read the cover seriously cracks me up i
think it looks hilarious and the Golden
Land of Malibu the Sun is hot the ocean
breeze is crisp and brides are deranged
dealing with for demanding
Megan waters thought her job as a
wedding planner would involve romance
and internal bliss instead her position
has been causing drama outrageousness
and as often made Megan reach for the
aspirin bottle and the trout drawer more
than once so those are some of my
favorite books to read absolutely the
book that I just released myself is
about a wedding and we've had another
marching ink book that Laura released is
about a wedding is actually about a
wedding planner I just love these books
and I feel like so many readers who
gravitated toward chiclet like we just
love good wedding books so Anna gave
this one five stars and that was down
the aisle with bridezilla bye Carly
Palmer okay the next one has quite the
title it is my grandmother asked me to
tell you she's sorry by Frederick
Backman and this was also reviewed by
Annie her very last line in her review
on Chiclets plus said this is a standout
original and she just she gave it a lot
of hype raised in her review and it says
on amazon this is a charming
warm-hearted novel about a young girl
whose grandmother dies and leaves behind
a series of letters sending her on a
journey that brings to life the world of
her grandmother's fairy tales this
sounds like a book that I would have
absolutely loved to read I had a really
close relationship with my grandmother
so I bet that I probably would have
enjoyed that story but I feel like at
the same time I probably would have
cried a lot but the link to andy's full
review will be below as well as the
amazon link if you want to check that
one out ok the next one that i gave five
star 5 stars2 I've been trying to figure
out if I included this in a favorites
video or if it's just because I talked
about it a lot again but it is the
knockoff and this one is by Lucy Sykes
and Joe Piazza I know that I've talked
about it in so many of my video so I was
trying to go back and see if airy put it
in a favorites video but the review went
up one chick love plus in July so I
don't think I would have but this one is
such a good summer read I absolutely
loved it I thought it was hysterical
even though the main character that we
follow is older she's an older woman who
leaves her job for a while actually
steal
with cancer and comes back and her
magazine has gone to like all online
there's a new person in charge that
they're not meshing well at work and
she's trying to learn the new style of
you know everything's on social media
everything is about being online and
she's trying to like work her way
through the world and even though I'm on
the younger generation side then she was
it was still a lot of fun to read I felt
like she was really relatable because
sometimes it is crazy when sometimes you
just listen to people's conversations
and what they're talking about and
posting on walls and it's just so funny
to think back you know 10 years ago or
when I was in high school like if we
were to hear these conversations
floating around in the hallway it would
be like you want me to tweet you what is
that I don't know what that means what
do you want me to do like it's just it
was so fun to think about it it is a bit
of a bigger book but it reads so fast i
read it in just a couple days so the
knockoff is one that i highly recommend
the next one micron five stars is the
retail therapist and this is by colette
Keeble this was also written by Annie
this is a novella we have had colette on
Chiclets plus as well and Annie's review
for her I will be sure to link her other
books below under this section so you
can check them out but again it is a
novella it says it's 91 pages it is free
for prime or Kindle unlimited on Amazon
orsa dr 99 regularly so a little bit
cheaper than a full-length day in her
review she said that it was entertaining
and it was hard to put down but then she
said it also make you want to do some
retail therapy for yourself so beware
you might want to go shopping if you
read this one and it's also a five-star
review from Annie and this is maybe in
another life by Taylor Jenkins freed and
this one has a lot of buzz around it to
Annie and her review said that it was
wonderful Chiclets and I was also very
unique read which I thought was really
interesting I for me myself I absolutely
love the cover I think that's what just
so I don't know it's very eye-catching
like when I was looking through the
covers I look at it right away
this is a breathtaking new novel about a
young woman whose fate hinges on the
choice she makes after bumping into an
old flame in alternating chapters we see
two possible scenarios unfold was
stunningly different results so I think
that's where Annie's comment about it
being so unique I think that's where
that comes in because how interesting
does that sound and I think that's very
interesting so we actually had two
people review this on Chiclets plus i
think the other review was either four
or 4.5 stars and then Andy gave it five
stars but honestly I kind of just want
to read it for myself because I'm
fascinated to see how that would play
out and especially as a writer I'm just
so curious to see how that book reads so
that's really interesting i will leave
both CLP reviews below as well and Inez
is the one that is five stars and the
last one I have to talk about is one
that I gave 5 stars2 and it is the cake
therapist and this is by Judith bartek
first of all I love the cover I love the
back which also features the cake which
this does play a part in the book as
well but I'm such a big foodie book
person I love books that revolve around
food and cook bugs and all that stuff I
have no idea why because I can't cook
bake walk into the kitchen I mean I
can't no no but that's just not for me
but for some reason I gravitate towards
these book I loved it but what I also
really enjoy in books is like the
magical realism that's not high sighted
at all is the magical realism effect and
that's what this book features as well
it mentions I think it's in the blurb
that mentions that the main character
Neely can taste feelings and I remember
reading that being like I don't know
what that means that just sounds really
weird to get the visions in her head
when she's working with different people
and working on different recipes for
those certain peoples she can start to
see visions and that socially helps read
people and it just it's very interesting
I don't feel like I'm describing it very
well because I feel like I'm just
driving it kind of like corny or not
believable but it didn't it wasn't like
that at all in the book I loved it and
it's what put it over the top for me I
honestly think if maybe that aspect
wasn't in there
pink in my review I call the pizzazz I
think is what I called it I don't if
that part was in that I probably would
have still enjoyed the book and gave it
like a four-star review but just with
that little sprinkle of something extra
and put it over the top for me and I
loved it so that is the cake therapist
by Judith fertig and I gave it five
stars those are all the books like I
thought stars from chocolate plus in the
month of July it's kind of crazy that
we're in august already I'm just glad
I'm getting this video up in the early
part of august for you guys because I
think in July it was like super light
like comically light like probably
didn't even need to do it kind of late
so I'm glad this one is up for you guys
already if you guys like seeing the
monthly favorites and the breakdown of
all the books that chick lit plus love
to please give this video a thumbs up
please subscribe if you have not and I
guess I will just catch you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
