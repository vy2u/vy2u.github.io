really excited because I have my first
favorites video ready for you guys and I
know I'm like so super late on this
everyone has been posting their June
favorites did I say July june july my
June favorites ready for you because it
is already like nearly mid-july and I'm
finally just getting this up this first
one is going to be kind of like my
beauty and lifestyle favorites and then
I do I have my book favorites hopefully
plan to get up next week so hopefully I
can get that filmed here shortly for you
guys as well I have a lot of different
things to talk about again with this
video so let's hop right into it okay so
first I have some beauty products to go
over with you guys and the first one is
a shampoo and conditioner and these are
from the pier adore line I'm not quite
sure how to pronounce that but I did
mention that they sent me a few items to
review a couple months ago and I've been
slowly like testing them out and
reviewing them I talked about the
vitamin C serum and also the argan oil
that they sent me and I really enjoyed
those products they also sent me the
shampoo and conditioner which i have
been using probably solely for the past
month now I often switch up my shampoo
and conditioner i always have probably
at least three different sets in my
shower at one time and I kind of switch
it up and go back and forth to the 1 i'm
reviewing products i will only use them
for a month just because I wanted to see
what they do to my hair and be able to
get a fair review so these of what i've
been using i do see some pros and cons
with each of them but honestly i think
the pros outweigh the cons and i am
really really super impressed with this
i was just talking to my girlfriend the
other night about like our hair care and
i mentioned these products and said how
impressed I was with them like about the
shampoo first which it says it has the
argan oil in it which right away I'm
like really impressed but it says it's
their premium organic shampoo and it's
for hair loss prevention therapy and
that might sound weird if I'm at 28
years old and I'm using like hair loss
products but honestly my hair comes out
in like chunks it's really disgusting
even after i shower and I comb through
my hair there's so much hair
on the comb I know I'm not the only
woman that deals with that plenty of my
friends complain about it all the time
too and because of it i honestly think i
have really thin hair and i'm always
trying to get more volume into my hair
and trying to find texturizing sprays to
use and all that fun stuff but it just
really like horrifies me how much hair i
lose every time i shampoo it so i
thought this could be something that's
really interesting to try and honestly i
have noticed a big big difference with
my hair and the only thing that i have
changed is the shampoo and conditioner
that i've used I feel like it has made
my hair fuller it is made it easier to
manage I've noticed that I don't have as
much frizz since i started using it and
honestly it just it looks thicker I'm so
impressed I'm so blown away because I
try out so many of the different
shampoos that you see are like celebrity
and doors and things like that and I've
never really been able to find a one
that I say I think actually makes a
difference and these really have so I am
I'm really honestly blown away with it
so it says there's 12 advanced DHT
blockers to stop premature hair loss
it's for thinning hair receding
hairlines and excessive shedding right
here me and adds body increases volumes
of thickens hair I totally agree with
that and it says it's for all hair types
men and women and color safe and there's
no paraben or normal harsh chemicals as
well so so super impressed I think this
is like $22 on amazon it's they have a
few different products as well I think
this exact one ran right around $22 so
super impressed it just comes with a
pump and it was real easy to get out the
con I would say is that I think you can
only order it online so I don't think
you can buy these at like drugstores or
Target or places like that so you would
have to order online and also I feel
like I need to use a lot of the product
in order to get a good lather going so I
use probably like double the amount i
would normally use in the shower so
you'll go through your product faster
especially if you have longer hair but i
think the pros really do outweigh the
cons the conditioner so they sent the
healing conditioner for daily
manageability there's lavender and the
nila extracts to soothe there's also
argan oil and ninety-nine percent
plant-based ingredients to nourish and
it's for enhanced shine control and
silky feel no harmful sulfates no
parabens it's also gluten-free well
would you look at that again I mean I've
been using it at the same with the
shampoo really enjoy it I don't feel
like you have to use as much conditioner
as i did shampoo I feel like just a
normal amount of conditioner was able to
work really well through my hair back it
says the lavender oil sis and nourishes
hair and scalp the vanilla extract helps
control frizz which I do agree with I
feel like my first has gone down and the
argan oil builds follicle strength I
agree with all of these I'm so impressed
with these the con that I have with the
conditioner is that so it has the pump
and I was not able you know usually like
twist the pumps and they pop up and then
you can just pump up into your hand that
did not work on this so when I want to
use it you can see I already have it
open I have to like take it and either
get a bunch I'm here and put it into my
hand or actually squeeze it onto my hand
so that's been a little bit frustrating
but overall really really really
impressed with these products and very
highly recommend them find them on
amazon and i'll be sure to link those
below a few other beauty products i have
to talk about the first is the too faced
chocolate soleil matte bronzer this is
in the medium/deep this bronzer I got as
a free sample so it's like just a tiny
little one I ordered some to face melted
lipsticks I'm actually wearing one right
now wearing jelly doughnut on my lips
right now ordered them they sent a free
sample of this bronzer and I love it not
only does it really smell like chocolate
which is like a big hit especially when
I'm around a bunch of my friends and I'm
like hey I smell this and I like yeah
that smells like chocolate it's very
easy to apply it's very easy to blend
out I absolutely love it as a bronzer I
think it looks beautiful I have it on
today and I really love getting little
samples because when I traveled it's so
easy to be able to throw these in my
travel bag so I mean if you can get a
sample if you're not sure yet you don't
want to get a full size 1 i've used it
several times and I feel like I've
barely made a dent in it so loving that
and another thing that I want to talk
about is babe lash it's an eyelash serum
I mentioned this I think it was maybe in
my Sephora haul when I talked about like
the whole pack of mascaras that I box i
bought like five mascaras and i talked a
little bit about how i never really had
long beautiful eyelashes and all that
good stuff until i started using this
babe lash serum cheryl serum and i
didn't have it down here at the time to
show in a video and a lot of people have
been asking me about it so i wanted to
show you guys what it is so this is what
it looks like i mean it almost kind of
looks like a mascara and then when you
open it up you just have this like
little wand and what I do is once a day
I will wipe it on like right where my
top eyeliner is I just put it Oliver
that spot just like one quick swipe and
that's really all you need do have to
have a license to get this you can't
just buy this at Target or places like
that my best friend is a licensed
aesthetician so she has her beauty
license and she is able to purchase this
from like Beauty Supply stores so it's
not readily available to everyone but if
you do have your license or you have a
good friend but does um I absolutely
love this utterly on board with this I
think each one is $45 I think which
might seem a little expensive but it
works and it works fast it was probably
within two weeks of when I first started
using it that I noticed a huge huge
difference and it saves money on fake
eyelashes because I haven't bought fake
eyelashes in I don't know how long
because i feel like i haven't had to so
yay a few more beauty products to talk
about the next one is this benefit
bronze of Champions box and I first
talked about this in my Sephora haul and
then I recently did my very first makeup
tutorial video and I used everything
almost out of this box and I love it not
only is it super super easy to travel
with and when I go places like you can
just bring this because it has a cream
eyeshadow a powder eyeshadow it has a
bronzer a bronzer brush a highlighter
the they're real mask
which is really really popular with one
foot it also does come with a lip gloss
the only thing that I don't like out of
the box is the lip gloss I didn't feel
like there's any color to it and it has
a really sticky consistency which I
don't like with my lipstick so I tend to
not really use that lip gloss at all but
everything else I totally love it I will
link my makeup tutorial below so you can
see it and see what I did with the box
but love the concept of it love how easy
it is to bring along with me when I'm
traveling so much this summer and I
think this entire box was like twenty
five or thirty dollars in my last two
beauty products that I want to talk
about are both from perfectly posh and I
got a like crap ton of samples about a
month back from my friend Cassie and
I've been like slowly working my way
through the samples but I have two more
that I want to talk about because I've
been really really loving them the first
these are like little samples that she
sends me like how cute are those but the
first is the under wonder poor primer
just a primer for your makeup and I'm
all about primers especially in the
summer I really like to use primers
underneath my makeup or even sometimes
alone my Maybelline like illuminating
primer sometimes I just wear it by
itself but I absolutely love to this
primer so there's just a little bit in
here and you probably can't see it at
all but it felt so silky going on my
face and I feel like it made my face so
smooth I really really enjoyed it I felt
like it did help keep my makeup in place
throughout the days that I tested it out
and tried it so if you're looking for a
good primer I really do recommend the
perfectly posh if you haven't tried
anything or you really love perfectly
posh and you're going to place a new
order soon I really do recommend this
under wonder pore primer I can also
leave links to cassie below if you want
to try perfectly posh but you don't have
a consultant yet i will leave her
information below i know she has like a
Facebook page and all that good stuff
that you can order from also the other
thing that I've been using a lot is the
cuticle cutie and this is just it smells
really good it smells like like lemons
right I feel like there's a lemon on the
package I use Sally Hansen like 3d
miracle
a top coat gel and the only way that I
can remove that topcoat gel is by using
not the regular nail polish remover but
what's it called like the acetone is it
the acetone nail polish remover that I
have to use which I know can be like
really bad for your nails and your
cuticles around it and drying and what I
do after I take my nail polish off I'll
take my nail polish off I'll wash my
hands and then I put this on all of my
cuticles you know my nails I rub it on
my nails all around leave it sit for a
while and then I'll wash my hands
because it does make you kind of like
sticky and slimy and they just make my
cuticles feel so much better I've
noticed the amounts i used to get hang
nails so much and i felt like they only
got worse after i had to start using
that nail polish remover and I feel like
the number of hangnails that I've had
have gone down a lot since I started
using this on a regular basis so I'm
super impressed I know not everyone
might not need something for their
cuticles around before I was just using
my argan oil on my nails too and I feel
like that helped but I love being able
to have to something really quick and
easy that I can grab and just put it on
there and kind of help rejuvenate my
nails a little bit so that's another one
from perfectly posh and I actually have
a few like clothing type materials to
talk about and first one is a swimsuit
top and this is from victoria secret if
you can see this ok this is the front
and it kind of has like the flowy
material on the top and then the back is
kind of fun to it's just like fun
criss-cross you're gonna get some weird
tan lines type of back and this was from
a victoria secret from their pink line
and I got it during the semi-annual sale
so it was really cheap I want to say it
was like less than twenty dollars I love
this mint green color I feel like it's
like so on trend right now but another
thing that I really love about it is
this flowy material on the top if you
are larger chested like myself and you
know those like triangle swimsuits are
like the halter swimsuit or strapless
boom suits just do not work for you this
made it so easy it was so comfortable I
didn't have to worry about like
any wardrobe malfunctions or anything
like that and it's also nice if you're
doing anything like family wise and you
don't want to look you can wear this and
I just love it totally down with this
one right now I want to get more
swimsuits with this type of material
because I just loved it so this is from
victoria secret i have two pairs of
shorts to talk about as well and they
are both workout shorts so if you don't
know i am part of the cheeky chicks it
is a instagramfitness page that me and
my best girlfriend created last
September it's really exciting because
we actually we almost have almost 5,000
followers on Instagram like as of
recording time I think we're like right
at like 49 50 which is so cool we've met
so many fun people we participated
really fun fitness and Instagram
challenges we've even hosted some we've
met really cool companies have gotten
really cool clothes and it's just been a
lot of fun to do so our Instagram page
will be linked in the description box
below if you want to check it out if you
have Instagram if you're interested in
yoga all that fun stuff but I wanted to
bring up to shorts that I recently got
one these are from Luna J athletic I'm
not totally positive i'm saying that
right but these are just like super cute
pink shorts i have no idea like what is
on them but i think they are just way
cute i really love this like band
because it kind of makes it like a
little bit high waisted so your shorts
like aren't like too scandalous are
falling down or anything like that so
these are from Luna jf athletic and I
will leave their links in the bottom bar
below as well I get asked a lot of
questions on yoga brands and clothing
companies about the fit and how they fit
for Luna J in particular these are a
medium and I usually wear a small I
ordered a medium because with shorts I
never really know like how short they're
going to be and I don't want like
volleyball player shorts going on what
I'm doing yoga because
that's kind of awkward so I ordered a
medium and honestly I still feel like
they were really really short they fit
fine in the waist but I feel like I'm
still kind of pulling them down a lot
could be a little bit longer for what I
want them for and then the other pair
this is from liquido active and these
are just like super fun purple print
again I'm not exactly positive what this
print I'm supposed to be on these but
this is from liquido active and i got
these and a small and I mostly did that
because they have these like ties on the
end which also have like really fun
charms on them but they have these ties
so you can like make your shorts longer
or you can't I mouth and kind of scrunch
them and make them shorter so that's why
I went with the smalls in this one and I
really love them i get so many
compliments on them both Shores are
super super comfortable both liquido and
lewd and j i have crap regular cropped
leggings for them as well and i do
purchase those and smalls and those work
really fine for me so I love both of
these brands so much and i think i
purchased both of these on i think it
was like their memorial day sale they
were both running like huge sales and so
I went out on bottom so for any like
athletic wear fitness gear are things
like that those are two companies that I
really highly recommend and then keeping
on the fitness front so I do a lot of
yoga but I feel like Holly and I are
always looking for new things to try we
do a lot of jillian michaels we also
both have the cody app and it's just an
app that you can have on your phone or
on your computer or tablet and you can
purchase different workouts on there we
have a lot of yoga workouts that we do
we have like handstand workouts that we
have purchased as well through the
Kodiak but I also use broker it's gr 0
ke ke R so it's just grill core com this
is what my profile looks like if you can
see that and I've had grill car for a
really long time it was free when I
signed up and I thought I heard that
they now charge a monthly membership but
I have not been able to confirm that i
will try to keep looking so i can list
it for you if it is but really really
loving their workouts right now
especially the ones by sarah cush and I
know if you'll be able to see this ok
but so Sarah she's like right here on my
profile page she has a four week plan
and she does a bar work out a hit
workout core workout and her workouts
are no joke I am sweating when i'm done
i'm exhausted I can barely walk the next
day but they are so good she has a lot
of fresh moves in their moves that I
feel like I haven't tried before moves
that I feel like are trying out new
things this is the second month so I did
her her first month I just did so she
has week 1 2 3 and 4 with one bar one
hit and one core and so I just do her
workouts three times a week the one hit
the one bar the one core and then I go
into week to ten week 3 then week 4 and
this is the second month that I'm doing
it because I think it really works I'm
getting such a good workout with her and
I just absolutely love it so broker also
has I mean they have yoga and kickboxing
and I think they have even have like
meditation on there they have really
good programs for I hurt my neck really
bad a few months ago and they have like
sort of workouts that you can do to try
to like help you through any aches and
pains or injuries that you're having I
think they also have like recipes on
there I've never dug into that but they
also have like live classes that you can
sign up and check into and you can do a
class but from your home but you're
following your instructor live it's
really cool they have a lot of really
good things but Sarah cush is someone
who I really really recommend if you're
looking for a good summer workout
especially her hit workouts are so hard
okay and then I just have two more
things to talk about for my favorites
video and the first so in last month's
video I talked about the dole smoothie
shakers that I love so much and update
I'm still drinking them like crazy i
absolutely love them i always get like I
think there's like five flavors
available at my grocery store and every
time I go shopping I grabbed five more
and drink them with my orange juice and
loving it but I also really really like
the kellogg's special k
protein shakes and the ones that I get
are in milk chocolate and I believe I
have vanilla and strawberry as well but
i like the milk chocolate ones it tastes
so good I have tried so many different
things so I don't drink as much coffee
or like sugary pops and things like that
in the morning and it says right on here
it says it satisfies hunger and I really
do believe that i'll drink one in the
morning and i feel fine up until
lunchtime like if i would have eaten
eggs or bowl of cereal or something like
that for breakfast I feel like the
satisfies me just as much as the food
does which is really amazing is gluten
free in case you're wondering as per
serving there is 190 calories that
contains five grams a total fat per
bottle 10 grams of protein five grams of
fiber one hundred percent daily value
antioxidant vitamins C and E and what I
do in the morning is I just shake it up
really good if you don't shake it up
because I've done this before I just
kind of opened it and took a drink it
tastes very like vitamin E and kind of
gritty so you really do want to shake it
up but I remember that happened to me
and I was like oh they're really is good
stuff in here for you because I can
taste it but you just shake it up and I
drink the full bottle and I think it's
great so I always have these on hand in
my fridge so if you're looking for
something else maybe in the morning or
as a snack throughout the day and you
don't want to do fast food or candy or
chips or things like that I recommend
giving these a shot the last thing I
want to talk about is a whole life super
random but it's actually snapchat so
I've had snapchat for I mean a while now
since probably I didn't jump on snapchat
train right away like some of my friends
got it and I was like I don't get it
you're just texting each other but like
taking a selfie at the same time I don't
understand it and then I finally got it
and it's like all I use its how all of
our friends communicate it's literally
how some of my friends communicate I
will snap job then to be like hey I'm
coming over or hey what are you doing
tonight and they respond back like text
messages i barely sent text
such as anymore it's so weird but I've
been noticing that so many like
celebrities and youtubers and even like
athletes are giving snapchat as ways to
connect with fans and I feel like we're
always looking for new ways to connect
with people and I I've talked about that
some in my videos as well like you know
I've created YouTube to kind of reach
out to more people we're always looking
for new ways to do that so I finally
decided to get snapchat for my business
I have my own personal snapchat but I'm
like well I'm sure like all of my
friends don't always care about like I'm
according to video or reading a book or
things like that and i'm sure my bookish
side of people don't really care about
my dog and how many snap chefs i scent
of her and you know when we go out with
friends and we're all taking pitches
together like they probably don't need
to see that and so i decided to finally
just start a separate on so my snapchat
name is just samantha dot march so there
is a dot in the middle Samantha dot
March and it's been really really fun so
far it's just a such a different way to
connect with people and like feel like
we know each other on on another level
so if you want to come follow me on
snapchat it's also a way i get so many
questions of like what I do during the
day and you know what my days are like
and this is just a really fun way that I
can show people you know what i'm doing
i wake up in the morning and you know
can send a picture and thought this is
what I'm doing or you know what I'm
filming or reading are things like that
i can send out pictures so you guys can
see what it is that I'm doing so I am
very new to it I'm not new to snapchat
but I'm new to it on my business side
and sometimes it's kind of a hassle to
like log I don't want to count log in to
the next account record videos you know
put them on my story and all that fun
stuff but I'm slowly getting more
accustomed to it so yeah if you have
snapchat and want to follow along with
me and get a little bit more insight
into my life it's been a lot of fun so
far so i'll leave my snapchat name below
as well but again it's just sing at the
march oh those are all of my favorites
or june for my
beauty and lifestyle again I'm sorry
this video is going up so late I will
try to be better next month look for my
