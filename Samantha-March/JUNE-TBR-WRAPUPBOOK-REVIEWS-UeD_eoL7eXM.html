kind of a lot of book reviews to go over
with you i haven't done a book review
video in a while so that is what today's
is going to be so because i know that i
have so many books to talk about let's
just get into it my hair is crazy but i
never wear my hair up in any videos and
some people pointed out and actually
what I was doing was exercising and I
had my hair down and it was really
sweaty so I pinned a claw clip to the
top of my head and this is what it
turned out like and I was like whatever
I'm just gonna leave it let's just roll
with it also I feel like I'm very tan
today and I'm filming this on a monday i
am in a wedding this saturday so i've
been using these like tan towels to self
tan i'm planning on doing a haul which
will feature the tan towels but then
also going into a more in-depth review
on them and how to use them and want my
experiences with them i'm only using one
time so far so I don't have like a full
review yet but I can definitely tell I'm
Tanner and that's why if you feel like
I'm really tan I have not been laying
outside because we've been so busy but
got a wedding this Saturday gotta pull
bridesmaid duty gotta look tan so
disclaimer look to talk about that I
reviewed all of these reviews are coming
from the month of june that is how far
behind I am on sharing my book reviews
with you guys the first one is fallen
idol this is love and music in Texas
book for from nikki lynn barrett and
nikki is like a virtual friend of mine
we work together on a lot of blog tours
she runs the blog storm goddess book
reviews and she's always sharing like
she has so many posts a day go up she's
sharing all kinds of new books all kinds
of genres and she also happens to be an
author herself so she pulls blogger and
author duty like me me to review this
book for her fallen idol which was a
part of CLP block tours i have read a
masterpiece of our love
by her as well I'm fallen idol it is the
fourth book in a series and I have not
read anything else in that series but it
was fine everything worked out I didn't
feel like I was lost or confused at any
point I really didn't even feel like I
needed to play catch-up at all so I very
much think it could be read as a
standalone novel Oh Kyra Sanders and she
was once like a pretty popular country
music star and singer and there was a
really serious accident for which she
took the fall for and that kind of
pushed her to get out of the spotlight
because there was just so much going on
it was an extremely terrible accident
and now we pick up and she's trying to
make a comeback in the country music
world but she keeps getting like almost
black males and she has all these scary
incidents happened to her so it's like
someone is trying to keep her out of the
spotlight of course there is romance
involved and I I really liked the book
and I thought it was fast paced again
even though as part of a series I didn't
feel like I was lost or confused at all
I like the romance aspect of it
sometimes I thought things seemed a
little too like crazy or out there but I
had to remind myself we're dealing with
a celebrity in the book and sometimes
celebrities leave pretty crazy lives and
they have crazy things happened to him
so even though there was a few points
where I thought things for maybe a
little bit too out there for my liking i
tried to keep in mind the tone of the
story and i ended up really enjoying it
and i gave it a 4 star review on chiclet
plus and the next book i won't go into a
whole lot of depthless because i did
feature it in my June favorites videos
which I will link below but it is the
same tangelos and it's by Jackie Collins
so in my June book favorite video I
talked a lot more about this and why I
loved it and a little bit more about it
so won't go into it too much here just
because i have so many other books to
chat about but check the description box
below and i will leave a link to it and
i'll just say if you haven't read
anything by Jackie Collins or anything
from her Santangelo line you really
should because they're really good don't
let the big book throw you off it only
took me a few days to finish so go check
it out
the next one is that I have is conquest
and this is by steam by Jew and this was
also another book I read for cl people
outdoors this one was pretty different
because it was divided in two episodes
and 4-cl people out tours we've got
episodes one through three and there's
ten episodes overall now this book is
definitely for a more mature audience
because it is like an erotica book so
basically the main character has like a
sex bucket list and she has ten items of
like people or professions or a task or
something that she wants to do to check
out her sex bucket list so that is why
you need to be a more mature audience to
read this book but I read episodes one
through three and I actually really
enjoyed them I thought it was funny they
were short they were snappy I thought it
was extremely intriguing to get episodes
and especially to break them down as she
did I believe four through six are on
amazon as well I'm not sure that the
other ones are out yet though but her
bucket list items is an older man a
younger man a teacher her boss a woman a
stranger a threesome in public make a
sex tape and dominate a man until he
cries conquest by theme by you that's
what I have to chat about is the broken
hearts Society of sweet 17 c and this is
by leanne cope ins and this is a new
adult book and it follows friends who
are starting college and will their
roommates and then they slowly become
friends but I'm new adult because they
are you know college students and kind
of finding their way and I mentioned in
my review that I didn't totally love the
cover and sometimes I I can really let
the cover get into my head and I can I
don't want to say I judge a book by it's
cover because I still read them I just
feel like I go into them thinking
something else but I actually ended up
really really liking this book it had a
lot more depth than maybe I thought it
was going to have I kind of thought it
was just going to be a book just solely
on you know relationships and the start
of college
the relationships you go through but
it's about friendship and family
self-identity I mean there was a lot of
really good topics in there and I
thought it was very well written it was
honestly one from like the first two to
three pages I was like oh yes I judge
this book wrong and I'm really gonna
like it so if you're a fan of new adult
I would definitely check out the broken
heart society of sweet 17 c by leanne
coppens i have is the idea of love and
this is by Patti Callahan Henry and
first I absolutely love this cover I
actually had a print copy of it and I
remember like taking a book selfie with
it now she was like I adore this cover
but I actually sent it to my mom to read
because she has read patty Callahan
Henry so when i mentioned i had the idea
of love my mom was like so I saw my mom
my copy of it but this book was pretty
interesting to me and I really I know
I've mentioned this in like my mailbox
post but I'm going to read this again as
we like to say in the south don't let
the truth get in the way of a good story
Ella's life has been completely upended
she's young beautiful and deeply in love
until her husband dies in a tragic
sailing accident while trying to save
her or social have everyone believe and
I honestly I kind of don't want to give
away too much of the story because you
know I went in to the book reading the
synopsis and thinking something in my
head will say in the beginning of the
book I was kind of tripped up a few
times like okay wait I'm not putting all
the pieces together i'm missing
something here what's going on and it's
not until a few chapters in that i
really started to understand what the
book was about and what was happening
and i found it pretty fascinating but
out there i will say again and we're not
really dealing with any celebrities in
this one besides the male romance
interest is like a screenwriter for
movies and in hollywood and all that fun
stuff but it basically covers two people
who fall in love but are just straight
up lying to each other the whole time
and it kind of goes through their
relationship the ups and downs how they
try to start to have a relationship
through all these lies when they get
discovered for who they really are
and it was really interesting to read it
was interesting to put the pieces
together the main character is also
going through a divorce which served for
several interesting moments in the book
some that made me laugh as well there's
also a really great or character who i
thought had such a good role in the book
and overall I thought it was very
intriguing and one that I ended up
really enjoying all right moving a lot
we're like halfway through so the next
one is any way you dream it and this is
by Monique MacDonald this was another
one with CLP blog tours it says this is
an upper-crust novel book too I did not
read book one but again I didn't feel
like I was missing anything or I was
misunderstanding anything or anything
like that so definitely can be read as a
standalone if you haven't read the first
one in the series basically we follow
Lucy who has a high school reunion
coming up and she tells a lie that she
is engaged because she's kind of
embarrassed about where she is in life
right now and you know maybe not as far
ahead as she had hoped by the time her
high school reunion comes along so she
actually gets set up with Chase who
agrees to be like her stand-in fiance
for the reunion and chase turns out to
be like basically every woman's dream he
is very wealthy and he's rich and he's
super nice and he treats her really well
we kind of follow the book up through
that you go to the high school reunion
and I won't tell you if they pull it off
or not because that's always a big thing
like will it be caught well they're not
be got what's gonna happen fall for each
other but of course they can't just like
fall for each other and be happy because
what kind of novel would that make a
short one so it kind of goes to the
trials and tribulations of their
relationship sometimes I was kind of
like what are we what are we waiting for
you guys will like each other I don't
understand what's going on but I won't
give away the ending but I enjoyed it I
ended up really liking the book thought
it was if you're a cute chick lit novel
it did read at a really fast pace for me
I finished it and a short amount of time
so I believe I ended up giving it 4
stars on chocolate plus it's fun that I
have
another one that I mentioned in my June
favorites video and it is dying brand by
Wendy Tyson if you are a mystery fan I
definitely recommend checking out Wendy
Tyson and her mysteries aren't life
suspenseful or threaten our mysteries
they lean more towards i want to say
light-hearted because i don't feel like
they're light hearted but they aren't
like I don't like super scary books I
don't like to be kept up at night
because I'm afraid of every little noise
or shadow and i really love when these
books i read all of them in the allison
campbell mystery this is booked three in
the mystery series and it is dying brand
i will again leave the link to my june
book favorites below so you can check
out all my thoughts on this one but it
did get by stars from be the next one i
have is things you won't say and a cloud
just came over and i lost all my light
can you guys still see me maybe not can
you see me here comes the sun is coming
back okay wait it's kind of came back a
little bit now I feel like it's going to
go under again Suzie won't say bye Sarah
peeking in I actually I listen to this
book on audio and I know I've talked
about it a few times in some of my other
videos I think I did a mail call when
I'd already started listening to the
audiobook and then I mentioned it in one
of my tag videos I reviewed this i think
on july first but i know that it's going
to go in my july book favorites video
because i gave it five stars I thought
it was such a moving book covers a very
serious issue of a white police officer
shooting and killing a Hispanic teenager
and it goes through kind of like the
chaos that happens when we have a racial
shooting in America I'm sure this comes
as no shock that this is a big problem
that our society is experiencing for
quite some time now it goes into we kind
of do get both sides of the coin here
and what it really focuses on is the
family of the police officer his
marriage with his wife and how it is
affected how the kids are affected by it
how their town is affected by it and it
just it was such a good read i thought
it was so powerful it really made you
stop and think and I just I just have so
many good things to say about
it again i know i'll bring it up in my
july book favorites video but if you're
looking for one this summer that you
really want to get into and have a lot
of depth to it i would say check out
things you won't say and the last one
last one that i have is now a major
motion picture i'm not sure how to
pronounce Stacy's last name Stacy would
our weed our mmm best-selling romantic
comedy author and this is my first one
by her so it was now a major motion
picture and I thought that was such a
cute titles very snappy i thought it
follows Amelia who after you know
experiencing heartbreak writes a novel
and it turns out that it's going to be
produced into like this big movie and
she's very nervous about it though
because the book is basically based on
this relationship and she knows that her
ex is to see the movie that he's going
to know what's about their relationship
and so it kind of goes through that
scenario which I just think is hilarious
it's so much fun reading as an author
because like that's you know what a lot
of our dreams are is to have our book
and our baby turned into a major motion
picture have a turned into a movie and
so that was kind of fun to see what a
writer you know would go through if her
book was being turned into a movie emily
is you know on the chiclet side there
was funny moments there sad moments
there's romance there's a brush with a
relationship with a famous movie star
that Amelia has and I just I thought it
was a very enjoyable chiclet read i
think i gave it four stars on Chiclets
plus and on the flip side from the book
that i just mentioned if you're looking
for a light-hearted vacation beach read
i would recommend this one for you so
that is a wrap up of a few of the latest
book reviews that i've done hopefully my
self tan didn't freak you guys out too
much I don't think I have any other
updates to pass along or anything else
to say can you guys see my shirt I don't
know if you can see it you see it it
says wifey
yeah my neighbors are walking by right
now like what's that girl doing right
you have started doing like a blooper
reel at the end of some of my videos I
don't think I'm going to do it and this
one just because I'm kind of pressed for
time editing wise but I used one hashtag
standard Samantha and one hashtag so
Samantha I think I'm going to go with so
Samantha just because it's shorter
standard samantha is like a bajillion
letters but if you guys like the blooper
reel like if you like to see some of my
outtakes please let me know and I'll
keep doing that for you I know a lot of
other youtubers seem to do them so I
thought like now that I'm finally
getting more comfortable with editing
I've actually kind of figured out a way
to take those outtakes and put them in a
separate clip for themselves so I'm kind
of excited about that so if you guys
like that let me know and I'll keep
trying to do it for you in some videos I
think that all i got like this video
give it a thumbs up if you haven't
subscribed please do it and i will just
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
