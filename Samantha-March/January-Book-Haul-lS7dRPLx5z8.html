channel today's video I'm going to doing
a new book haul for you guys so these
are all the recent books that I've been
given to buy like an author publicist to
blog to her that sort of thing I think I
have a good amount this month to share
with you guys so when we did first one
that i have is magic wand ranch and this
is by Carolyn Mickelson and I actually
just finished reading this the night
before i'm filming it was a very short
read because it is a novella so it only
took me like a day to get through so
that was nice but i did i just finished
it but i did want to mention it it's
really cute though because we follow
Fiona who is a fairy godmother and
because it is a novella and it's so much
shorter we don't really get into all of
the details of like why how what her
world is like we just know that she's a
fairy godmother if she has one she has
magic glitter she makes things happen
and she gets put on an assignment to
like babysit two boys and during that
time they have an uncle who was watching
them and then he was supposed to leave
and she's supposed to watch them but
they form like a love connection and
then he's in an accident and she gets to
decide whether she wants to like use her
magic to save him but then she would
have to give up her magic and it was
really good like I said it's a short
novella so we don't get into all the
specifics of everything and you know
they fall in love very quickly because
we only have so many words we need to
get them fallen in love pretty quick but
I thought it was super cute i love
little touches of magic and book so I
really lent that one the next one I got
is matching me if you can and this is by
Michelle Gorman I believe I have talked
about Michelle on my channel before but
i have read almost every single book or
novella that she puts out she does do a
lot of novellas match me if you can is a
full-length novel and it actually is a
new release and it is the book i'm also
reading right now so it released I
believe the dead of that I'm filming
this video and my review will go up next
week but I just started reading it I
really like her book she's
British UK author but she writes really
good Chiclets I literally just started
it so I really can't tell you a whole
lot about it but from amazon it says
have you ever thought about recycling
your ex and we follow three friends
Katherine Rachel and Sarah they are fun
smart successful and they are all single
and one of the friends is a matchmaker
that's Kathryn she's a matchmaker and
she has like she has like a dating site
and she gets her friends to sign up
there but what you do is you recycle
your ex-boyfriends in exchange for an
upgrade so I'm just like two chapters in
so I haven't even really gotten into it
very much yet but so far it seems like
it'll probably a pretty good read
there's a lot of like good humorous
moments already starting so definitely
like a romantic comedy chicklet feel
next one I received is a jingle Valley
wedding and this is by Martha Reynolds
and this one says New York executive
Julie Tate knows what it takes to win in
the financial world but her big city
success could never prepare her for her
latest career move when her mother
abandons the failing family the failing
family farm Julie hopes its salvation
lies and transforming it into Western
Massachusetts newest premier wedding
venue with their social savvy friend
Freddie in recorder Julie Phil's
infallible Beth our bank account
dwindles and one obstacle after another
cops up the business partners wonder if
their venture is doomed for failure
before the first bride walks down the
aisle maybe the best way to succeed in a
business based on romance is to find one
I really like wedding books so it had
wedding in the title read that it was
about a wedding and I was like or not
about a wedding but about what I'm
planning and all that good stuff and I
was like probably gonna like this one so
looking forward to reading a jingle
valley wedding so are if you guys can
hear me like sniffling a lot it is so
cold outside it is so cold we had what
the weather called an arctic blast last
week and now we are in another one it's
so crazy because yesterday was 43
degrees here like people were outside
without coats on I live in I
I mean legit like people were going
crazy like spring was here and then
today I think the high was like 20 which
really isn't too bad but tomorrow the
high I think it's negative 5 and that's
without the wind chill that's just like
regular weather and then I think sunday
is going to be a high of three degrees
excellent next one that I have it's
called the exes in my glass how I
refined my taste in men and alcohol and
says this is a dating memoir and it is
by lisa m madsen i got this email from
the author about if I would want to read
and review it and I don't read a lot of
memoirs but for some reason I feel like
I'm reading more but I'm really enjoying
them especially when they have like this
kind of twist on it like the humorous
twist on it like almost like the chiclet
twist on it for some reason I'm just
like really really enjoying these one of
my favorite memoirs like ever is dangled
carrot by Hilary Grossman and I read it
not even knowing that it basically it's
not really defined as a memoir and it
reads just like a chick-lit novel and
then you find out at the end like as i
was reading it I was like well holy crap
we just read her story like I had no
idea and then I just read one it was a
holiday one Christmas confessions and
cocktails by Vicki lesage and I'm like
that was hilarious it was a memoir but
it was all like funny stories that she's
gone through around the Christmas time
so I'm really enjoying them so I got
this one and I thought about passing it
off and then I was like you know what
I'm gonna read it so it says the Hat
Lisa Matson thought she'd grow up to
acquire a taste for cheap beer and guys
named Bubba not spent her weekends
cruising through napa vineyards and
convertible when she flees the rural
Midwest for the big city in her 20s she
struggles with negativity and security
and double standards of dating falling
for a mind-numbing string of
ex-boyfriends that honed her palate and
guide her destiny grab a corkscrew and
join Lisa on her not so straight and
narrow road to a fabulous life in one
country where her glass and heart are
always full the woody story of her
rochesterny from lust and love to be her
in mine the ex isn't my glass will leave
you
RCM cork to inquire your true potential
as well like that just sounds good right
really excited to give this on a read
the next one I have is just a kiss and
this is by Kate kiss it and it says it
is in the series the single girls wine
club a wine country romance series book
one so I'm excited I love wine I was
like okay has three friends one wine
country villa six Santino brothers and
lots of wine oh oh my so this is listed
as a romance book and I look forward to
reading that the next one that I
received is up and in and this is from
Deborah Disney and Deborah emailed me
and said that she was given my name and
my blog's name from Tess woods and she
thought test sent really great things
about me suggested that i sent that she
send me a copy of her book so i could
read and review it on chiclet plus and I
was so thankful for that because I
absolutely love test woods i raved about
her on triple 0 plus i braved about her
on youtube I think she's such a
fantastic author I absolutely loved her
book and I just was very thankful that
she was letting other authors know about
me and about chiclet plus and so I was
so excited to read up and in from
deborah disney and from amazon it says a
laugh-out-loud debut that will delight
fans of Liane mortuary and Fiona Higgins
this is the devil wears prada at the
school gates and I'm like okay I really
like the cover to like it's just the way
that the font is for up and in I thought
was very eye-catching to all the women
on the cover and how they were the same
because it kind of got me thinking like
that maybe we'll tie into it it was a
cover that I looked at it and I
immediately started thinking about
what's gonna happen in the book does
that make any sense to anybody but it
was like one I didn't just look at the
cover and be like okay I looked at the
cover and was like oh I bet this happens
and I bet this happens and i read this
happens and that drew me and pretty
quickly so i don't know if that makes
any sense but if it does I hope so but
yeah really looking forward to reading
one in January the very last one that i
have actually just got this one in last
night but it is no ordinary life by
Suzanne Redfern i have read from her
prior and i think she is a fantastic
author so I knew when I saw it I was
really interested in reading it I was
really glad that we got the review
request in from her publicist but I also
remember a while back actually voting on
the cover of this book I think there was
like two or three different covers and
they asked I can't remember if it was
just on social media or if they
contacted specific blogs but to ask them
to vote on the cover and I remember that
this was the cover that I voted for so I
was like so excited to see that cover
because it just I just loved it the big
bow in the red I'm just into it it says
Suzanne Redford delivers another
grouping page turner and her latest
novel a story about a young mothers
fight to protect her children from the
dangerous role of hollywood and so i was
very much like yeah I'm gonna need to
read that one because it just it sounded
so good to me for all of these books i
will leave them linked in the
description box below i will put their
link to amazon on there so you guys can
easily click that go check it out see if
maybe you would want to get the book
some of these are going to be new
releases so some i think most all of
them will be for sale but some of them
like I know no ordinary life comes out
in February I believe comes out februari
second so some of them are available to
pre-order and that sort of thing but i
will have their amazon links listed
below if you do want to go over all the
books that i received in my january book
haul and i'm so looking forward to
reading some of these i will be sharing
my reviews on chiclet plus i also put
all my book reviews on amazon if they
let me cuz amazon deletes my reviews
like all the time which is incredibly
frustrating I don't know it's any other
book blogger run into that problem
because it seems like any author that I
talk to frequently on social media I
can't review for them anymore which is
ridiculous like Amazon is saying that if
you know an author you can no longer
review for them which is crap because
how else am I supposed to
like help promote and like get to know
and out there like I don't want to read
someone's book and be like I would tell
them that I think it's great but I can't
because the animal sounds going to slit
my wrists and not let me put a review of
and reviews are so important to authors
so important to authors like we just
rely on our reviews so much so amazon
it's like two or three a week that
Amazon deletes and I constantly get
emails from them like we're gonna shut
down your account if you don't stop
reviewing books and I write back and I'm
like I'm a book blogger what do you want
me to do like the legit is my job so
feel like I'm going to fight with Amazon
every other week but does that happen to
anyone else because sometimes I feel
like it's only me that it's happening to
and I'm like I'm not the only book
blogger out here that also talks to
authors on internet right so I share all
my reviews on chuckle applause amazon
and goodreads like i said all the books
that i mentioned will be listed in the
description box below have any other
video recommendations or suggestions
that you would like me to do for the
book side please do comment below and
let me know i think i'm going to try to
film one like author focused video here
this month so if you guys have any ideas
of what you want to see someone did
mention the other night on social media
like a do's and don'ts for authors and I
totally can do that i don't know if i
should like focus it on something like
do's and don'ts of social media do's and
don'ts oh I have no idea maybe I'll just
do it in general because I can't even
think of specifics but that's what I'm
leaning towards but if anyone else has
any other suggestions please just
comment below and let me know and give
this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it
subscribe before you go and I'll just
cut you guys in my next video bye good
just for life shirt in a video look did
