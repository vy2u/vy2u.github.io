video all my January beauty favorites
and I said this in my January book
favorites video how usually in favorites
video everyone's all like going crazy
over how fast the month went but like I
said in there and January just seemed to
take forever for me I don't know what it
was I don't know but it just seemed like
the longest month ever so we'll see how
februari goes for me but I was actually
kind of excited to get into februari
mostly because I really don't like
winter and I just feel like once we get
in these winter months like I just want
the next month to be here like now I
can't wait for march to get here not
only because it's my birthday month but
I'm like oh we're getting a little bit
closer to having this mother be over but
then today as I'm filming we got I don't
know I don't know I wouldn't call it a
blizzard I'm not going to call it a
blizzard the news was saying that we
were supposed to get a blizzard and I'm
looking outside I mean maybe we got like
four inches maybe i'm not good at
counting I have no idea to be honest I
had no idea i think we probably got like
four inches it's nothing extreme but i
guess we have more on the way but the
winds were really bad so it wasn't just
know it was always like crazy winds
combined but I'm like ah let's just get
those the author over with really random
introduction but welcome to my favorites
video and let's hop in and see what I've
been loving in Juneau my first beauty
favorite is the new L'Oreal True Match
Lumi cushion foundation i did a first
impressions video on this that i can
link up here and the description box but
i did the first impressions of it and i
have just been so happy with the
foundation so that's what the cushion
that looks like and then the cushion is
soaked with a foundation and in the
video i applied it to hack my face with
the Real Techniques makeup sponge and i
applied it to the other half of my face
with my morphe and 439 brush which is
the brush that I normally use for
foundations and in the video I was like
I don't know if I really have a
preference I can't tell what I wanted to
say that I do prefer
the makeup sponge the beauty blender or
thought sort of thing that is what I
prefer to use because I don't know
something about how it applies with the
damp sponge I just really AM gravitating
more towards that then with the brush I
also feel like with the brush I get more
product so if you if that's something
that you want you want the more product
you want to be able to build it up more
I would say he's a brush but for me I
kind of like it the lighter coverage to
it and so that's why I've been
gravitating towards my Beauty Blender it
gives the skin such a beautiful luminous
glow of course I don't have it on today
because that would make too much sense
but I actually have like a bunch of
hormonal breakouts and so I need it
something with a little bit more
coverage so it was one of my Maybelline
foundations which is just gives me a
little bit more coverage don't have it
on today but i have been wearing it like
non-stop absolutely love it oh I just
I'm so happy with it it is very
expensive so i know that i'm going to
want to repurchase this and i'm afraid
i'm going to go through it very quickly
because there's not a lot of product in
here what was it like point 5 ounces or
something like that yeah point five
ounces are in here so I'm afraid we're
going to go through it fast and it's
1699 at the drugstore so I'm like do I
want to repurchase it but honestly I
probably would because i like it so much
a product that i feel like Mahalo be in
my next empties videos is from pier
cosmetics and this is therefore in one
pressed mineral makeup and this is what
it looks like if you can tell why i
think it's gonna be in my empties video
next this stuff I don't know if I've
ever talked about about it on my channel
and I got mad myself for thinking that
because I have gone through this
specific product I have probably gone
through four of these since I bought it
and I don't even really remember why i
bought it i don't know if it was a
recommendation i don't know if i just
saw it one day decided to buy it but for
whatever reason I bought it one day and
fell in love with it and constantly
repurchase these and I have been
reaching for this so
I usually on days where I don't wear a
lot of makeup I just brush this all over
my face my shade isn't an and it just
gives me you know like I'm not super
pale looking then and it just gives me a
little bit of coverage but it's not
anything heavy it's not thick obviously
it's not a liquid foundation so I cream
foundation it's just a light powder that
I can push over my skin and make me look
a little bit more human so if there's
any days where even if I'm just gonna
like run to the store and I'm like girl
you lookin like a vampire I just put
this on I mean I wear it so often and
sometimes what I'll do like if I don't
want to wear a full foundation either
and I just want to do like a BB cream a
lot of times I'll do the BB cream and
then I will put this on top of it and I
love it as you can see i'm about to go
through another one but you can get pure
cosmetics I believe these are also sold
at Ulta I was just there and I saw them
and I was like I should pick up another
one because I'd know getting down there
but yeah love it for one pressed mineral
make so I have an eyeshadow that I've
been loving and I feel like this is kind
of random because I've had it for so
long but it is just an eyeshadow that I
am reaching for all of the time it's
from makeup geek and it is called creme
brulee so it's just a very light brown
shade I guess I could probably do a
swatch for you if you'd be able to see
it because it is like it's just super
super light I don't know if you guys can
even see that at all but it is just a
very light brown and it's such a perfect
transition color except a perfect crease
shade and a lot of times what I've been
doing with my makeup lately is either
just doing like putting this in my
crease and doing like a colored liner
like I have a lot of the cream gel
liners from colour-pop in some fun
colors they could deep burgundy a green
what else do I have like a light purple
and i like to use those and so I just do
literally this is the only eyeshadow
that I'm wearing and then I do the fun
eyeliner
or else I'll do just this eyeshadow and
are really dramatic black winged liner
with big lashes and that's what I do for
my makeup click on days where i'm like i
don't want to get into eyeshadows I
don't want to hurt my hand by blending
today this is what i'm going to do and
this is the color that I putting in my
crease just to give my eyes a little bit
of definition literally only shade that
i use and i love it so this is from
makeup geek they are very affordable i
will be sure to link in the description
box below this is creme brulee so i have
a nail top coat that i've been loving
and i got this in an influenster box and
i believe i talked about my love for it
when i did my unboxing with influence
turks i had used it a few times but i
wanted to come back in here and just
tell you guys how much i love it i hope
i didn't put it in the favorites video
maybe i did now I don't remember but
anyways I love it i'm still using it
it's on my nails right now but it is the
sinful shine top coat so that is what it
looks like so I mean it's just it's just
a regular top coat but I did I got it in
my influenster box I got this and a
color from sinful this is simple colors
yeah from sinful colors um I got one and
I put the nail polish on and I kind of
wasn't really sure about it and then I
put the top coat on and I was like I bet
the top coat isn't going to do anything
but it does it when i did my first
application with this it left my nail
polish on my nails with no cracks no
chips for nine days and i ended up just
taking off my nail polish because i was
tired of looking at that color but still
even on like day seven and eight i was
out of town and my mother-in-law said
something to me about my nails and she
was like they're just so shiny and I'm
like they've been on for a freakin week
I don't know what's going on and then I
used it again I mean I've used it
several times between then but I used it
just a couple weeks ago and what color
did I use it with it was a color that i
was like i'm not sure i really want to
wear this color but whatever i'll put it
on and then i put this top put on and
then it didn't crack or chip and I was
like man I don't know if I'm digging
this color but my nails still look
really good so I'm just going to leave
it on so I did and
I just paint my nails this morning this
color is mad about you from OPI I
believe and then I put this top coat of
work so i was like i'm really digging
these pink nails right now and i want
this color today so i'm putting on my
simple shine top coat very affordable i
believe you can get this at walgreens
but i will link it below but i know it
is very affordable ok then i just have a
few lip colors to talk about before I
jump into like a few random favourites
that I like to talk about but I have to
from colour-pop because I feel like I
will always talk about color pop one is
a liquid lipstick and I feel like if you
guys follow me on instagram you guys
know what color of this is it is chilly
chilly I have been wearing this like
non-stop and I what I would like post
makeup pictures and they would be
different looks diff it looks different
outfits different eye makeup but I'd
still be wearing chili chili in it and
I'm like girlfriend you gotta you gotta
switch it up you can't just keep wearing
chilly chilly but then I'm like why not
who who says that I can but that is
chilly chilly keep in mind this is
something that I just watched it will
dry down Matt but i love it and i
actually have an interesting story about
this when i got chilly chilly I got it
because everyone was talking about it I
mean ensing was all over it um Danielle
Wright was all over it and I was like
all right I'm gonna get it looks like a
color that i really like it reminded me
of veronica i believe was veronica from
anastacio and i really wanted that one
and it kept being sold out so i was like
i'm just going to get the six other one
from colour-pop I got it and I was like
that was not what I was expecting like
it just looked so dark on my lips I
don't know if I wasn't expecting it to
be his door because it was I don't know
I just when I first put it on I was like
well that sucks I'm probably never going
to wear that and then for some reason
and I mean literally that was months ago
that i bought this and I don't feel like
I've ever worn it again I ward in one
video and I was like nope don't like the
way it looks of course I'm not wearing
it right now again because I would make
too much sense but I am wearing bumble
from colour-pop on the lips and it was
just like a couple weeks ago I saw it in
there and I was like you know what I'll
wear this today
had like a simple eye makeup look like
one of those simple looks that I was
talking about so I was like this is
pretty dark I'll just put it on and like
go with the bold lip and I put it on and
I was like I don't know what happened I
don't know why my first impression was
so strange and I don't know why I all of
a sudden love it now but now I can't get
enough of it can't stop wearing it I
absolutely love it so chilly chilly like
I'm so glad I gave you a second chance
because we're BFFs now bffs one from
colour-pop is cookie and this is in
there lippy sick this is one of the very
first colors or even just products in
general that i got from colour-pop and i
feel like i've probably mentioned cookie
in a past favourites video but seriously
I just love it it's such a pretty nude
shade and it does dry matte it is one of
their matte finishes so it's just a
beautiful like brown nude I will wear it
alone I really like it was Macworld lip
liner and um one of the NYX lip liners
slip liner in nude beige I really like
it with nude beige as well or else like
I said I'll wear it alone or sometimes
I'll wear it as a topper but it is just
such a gorgeous shade so yeah so we got
little yeah so chilly chilly and then
cookie both from colour-pop loving on
them and then the last one that I have
is from the new TARDIS lip paints from
Tarte cosmetics and the shade I have is
tvt and i just recently talked about
this in my latest collective makeup haul
that i got and these TARDIS love paints
are new i think they just launched in
like december or january and they are
new either twenty dollars each they also
do each come with a corresponding a lip
liner I believe TV T's is later grant
but I didn't get into lip liners but I
hear really good things about them but
there is such like mixed emotions about
the liquid lipsticks because I think
it's because they don't dry completely
matte and I talked about this in my hall
but they don't they are they will
transfer they don't
completely matte like a liquid lipstick
would but in that same regard they are
also very comfortable on the lips I
think they feel almost like the NYX soft
matte lip creams except they last longer
than the next soft matte lip creams do
and also you know they do transfer so
when I wear them I do have to reapply
them but they are also very easy to
reapply whereas with a liquid lipstick
it's kind of hard to reapply because it
gets like cakey on your lips you know
what I'm saying but these do not so they
are easy to reapply but I love this
color I think it's beautiful I've been
wearing it so much this was one of the
colors like chili chili that I was like
smooth that you have to put a different
look color I'm like people are going to
get tired of seeing you wear TBT but I
love it it's just like that beautiful
like mauve brown shade you know that we
all love I love it I can't stop wearing
it i will definitely be getting more of
these lip colors because i love them all
so they have like a really funny smell
to them like not funny bad but it almost
has like a minty smell to them and even
when you put it on your lips it's almost
like you're putting on it reminds me of
my EOS i don't know if that's how you
say it like those little like egg lip
glosses i have met one in mint and it
almost kind of like it feels like kind
of refreshing when you put it on your
lips I really like them I know there's a
lot of mixed reviews about them but I
enjoy them so if you don't mind your
lipstick doing just a little bit of
transfer not as much as a normal
lipstick would or a lip gloss I mean I
say go for them especially in TBT it's
like two random kind of topics to touch
on that are my favorites one favorite is
my hair these top knots not my hair in
general but just the top knot and I want
to talk about it because I am hearing
people say like oh the top knot is not
in 4 2016 and I'm like who's saying that
and why I just discovered the top knot
no lie in like late November and so I'm
like I'm not done rocking this and I
will keep doing it and mostly because it
is such a freaking easy hairstyle and I
am someone who is not good at doing my
hair the only thing that I feel like I
can do with my hair
is curling it but I don't like to curl
it often because I don't like to use
heat on my hair and I don't ever blow
dry my hair I curl my hair like maybe
once a month afore doing a nice event
I'll curl my hair I don't straighten my
hair I leave heat off my hair I've done
enough damage to my hair I don't need to
repeatedly hurt it every single day by
putting heat on it and so to be able to
just throw it up like this and like it
just looks better when it's just like
limp and hanging down and I have like
I'm going on I think 16 weeks between my
hair appointments which is not good and
I can totally tell and i'm so happy that
i just scheduled a hair appointment i
cannot wait because with highlights
especially blonde highlights you're
supposed to do your hair appointments
like every 6-8 weeks i'm on week it's
either 16 or 17 I don't think we're at
18 yet but it's at least at 16 weeks
since I've gotten my hair done last and
I just don't have time and when you're
self-employed it's really hard to take
time to do things for yourself
especially something like getting your
hair done it just makes me feel so silly
like I could be at home working not
sitting here getting my hair done Mel's
countless silly but I know it's
something that I need to do especially
with being on camera I get so
self-conscious about my hair and my
roots and whatever but it just like
needs a haircut really bad too so
instead of just like letting it down and
being kind of like loose and stringy and
gross I just throw it up in a super easy
top knot I don't need to do anything
sometimes they'll tease my hair usually
I don't it's just so easy so whoever is
saying the top knot is not in for 16 we
are not friends I don't care what you
say I'm going to rock it till I want to
stop rocking it you do you well then
just the last random favorite it's just
something that I wanted to share with
you guys because you know we just
entered a new year 2016 hope it's going
fabulous for you but you know what the
start of a new year you know everyone's
making their resolutions and their goals
for 2016 which i think is totally
awesome but my husband in January like
the first or second week maybe a January
he said everyone's doing this planking
challenge he was seeing it all over
social media this planking challenge I
think it was like every day you added 10
seconds on your plank and then you were
supposed to do that daily and he was
like we could do that and I'm like yeah
we can do that and we were doing it we
were doing it and I was like you know
what that I think would be easier than
like making some crazy resolution at the
beginning of the month that you use you
that you usually lose interest in by
March I said to him I was like why don't
we decide on some sort of like healthy
goal every single month and focus on
that for a month so for January we did
the planking and then for februari we've
decided that we are not going to eat
fast food which is going to be hard my
husband and I we don't cook a lot or eat
at home a lot he's the only one who does
cook so if he doesn't feel like cooking
it's mad on me we just go out to eat
because no one wants me in the kitchen
no one wants me there so and a lot of
times we just go to McDonald's Wendy's
Arby's takisha dairy queen like we don't
make the healthiest of choices so we
decided for februari that we are not
going to do fast food and I'm excited
about it I'm a little nervous about it
I'm afraid like what are we gonna do
when we get down to those times that
were like oh my gosh we're so starving
but we don't want to go to a restaurant
like what are we gonna eat so I don't
know we'll see how it goes we did say
like jimmy johns and subway would be
okay i don't consider them fast food I
don't know you guys do but we said that
we wouldn't consider it fast food
because I think subs are a healthy
option but we'll see how we do but it
definitely was a favorite in January not
only to be doing something healthy for
myself every day but to be able to do it
with my husband and we're they're kind
of like encouraging each other so I
don't know I just it's an idea if you
guys think it's like too overwhelming to
try to make a yearly goal for yourself
you know break it down in two months if
you can have a partner just a friend or
family member to be able to do it with
and kind of keep each other in check I
think it could be a good idea so I'll
let you guys know next month how we did
in February and what we'll be doing for
March cuz I don't know what that is good
everyone so those are my January
favorites I hope you guys enjoyed this
