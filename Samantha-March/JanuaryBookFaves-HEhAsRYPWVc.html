there was a strange truck pulling into
my driveway I'll try again hi everyone
welcome back to my channel how are you
today hopefully quite well today's video
is going to be a favorites video this is
going to be our book favorites from the
month of January so this is all the
books on Chiclets plus that got five
stars either from myself or someone on
my review team just anyone that gave a
book five stars I'll be going through
all of those books it's so funny because
I feel like in every favorites video
myself and other youtubers are like fire
and phones and I'm like yeah when I took
for freaking ever I remember one day
being like oh my gosh it's almost
februari because so I do yoga with my
best friend for the cheeky chicks I feel
like I said listen every video what we
are but each month at the end of the
month we have to pick what yoga
challenges we're going to do for the
next month I'm going to take our
pictures together it's a whole big deal
and I remember at one point I was
getting ready to text her to be like
dude we haven't decided on challenges
what are we doing and it was january
twentieth well I thought it was like
january thirtieth who might come on
month get over like let's let's get this
frame let's get to summer what are we
doing with this winter weather really
long introduction but why don't we
happen to the favorite in January I was
so happy about it because it is for
Perry and progress and this is by Kat
lavoie and Michelle is the one who
reviewed this one Perry and progress is
a book that was published by my
publishing company marching ink I
typically will always ask someone on my
review team if they want to review the
books that we put out from marching ink
because obviously I cannot review it
because of course I think all these
books are fabulous or else why would I
publish them so I was so happy to see
Michelle give it five stars so so happy
about that if you are a lover of
Chiclets I definitely would recommend
Perry in progress to you but also cats
other
balls as well each book that I do
mention in this video will be linked
below i will leave the amazon link if
you would like to perhaps purchase a
book and also the review link to
Chiclets plus so you can read the full
reviews for yourself the next review is
from Christie and this is for nicknames
tales from the shallow end of the
Manhattan dating pool and it is by Mary
Geneva I thought it was really
interesting because one of the first
lines that Christie said is that she
feels like it's kind of like sex in the
city but from a younger point of view
and I thought that was very interesting
in her review I mean she obviously gave
it five stars but her review actually
encouraged me to buy the book I have not
read it yet but I do have it on my
Kindle just because like I love sex in
the city i got into sex in the city not
like i got into sex in the city add sex
in the city was like about getting over
but it also came out when I was very
young and obviously I couldn't be
watching Sex in the City at that age but
I lost sex in the city I was very
intrigued by her comments and especially
just her full review in general i saw
this cover was really cute as well and
it sounds just like a book that i would
enjoy so thank you christy for
encouraging me to do that yeah that is
nicknames I also want to point out if
you follow me on snapchat you know that
I've been sick for a while my husband
was really sick and then he got me
really sick because that's what a good
marriage partner does but I just have
not been feeling well and today I still
don't feel the best and I tried like I
wasn't going to put any makeup on and I
was like put some makeup on like dude
get it together and so somehow i ended
up with like a purple I'm like how did I
the day that I'm like don't put out a
lot of makeup I go with like purple
sparkles like okay okay Samantha so then
I put on this bright red lip to try to
like balance everything out I don't know
I got I started to get carried away I
could carried away this is what happens
when I get sick but it still feel like I
just looked like a pale sick girl in
camera so if I don't seem as
enthusiastic or my voice seems weird or
I just look like I'm gonna faint at any
moment it's because I've been battling
some sort of flu stomach bug for the
past few days
the next one is actually a five-star
review from me it is for how to look
happy and this is my Stacey Stacey weed
our wit our by Stacey and i have read
Stacey's books before and I was really
excited when she asked me to review how
to look happy because it just seemed
like a book that I would on a raid and
it was so funny because I remember
trying to write this review but I was
like I just want to keep saying like her
funny and I cannot get from round okay
hurry Jamie and I feel like that's kind
of what my review came off like anyways
I don't know if it was like the best
review I've ever written because I just
felt like I kept saying like Jeremy but
it just made me very enthusiastic
because I really enjoyed the book and I
think fellow Chiclets and romantic
comedy fans would really enjoy it as
well so particularly loved the term
drunk booking that she used because that
kind of like what sets off all these
series of events in the book is that our
main character gen gets quite toasty one
night and puts a facebook status out
there that she probably should not have
put out there and i kind of like spirals
out from there and it's a very like in
the now modern trendy book about how
social media can be really good and
social media can be really bad and I
just enjoyed it enjoyed it very much
give it five stars the next five star
review is from leah and this is for the
bitter season and it's by tammy hope
hope possibly Kovac and let's go take on
a multiple take on multiple twisted
cases as number one New York Times
bestselling author tami hoag explores
I'm heard from the past I'm order from
the present and a life that was never
meant to be and in Leah's review she
says it starts off with a bang and the
intensity of the book never dials down
throughout so Leo was a big fan of this
one and I sounds like a good like murder
suspense book type just from reading the
synopsis it kind of like gave me the
chills to be honest um every once in a
while like I'm very much like the
chiclet the romance the women's fiction
the humor
the comedy like those are the books that
I gravitate towards too but every once
in a while I do like to get something a
little bit deeper in there and something
with mystery because it just really
improves me I feel like it keeps my mind
running throughout the whole book and
this definitely sounds like one that
would be a good one the next five star
review is also from me it is for
novelist a girl and this is my Meredith
shore Meredith Shore is definitely on
like my top list of authors I love her
so much I've had the pleasure of meeting
her in person twice in Canada and also
in New York and it would just it's so
awesome to be able to meet authors like
Meredith was someone who I started
reading and reviewing like very early on
and she quickly became a favorite author
of mine and then to be able to get to
meet her was like I will always remember
that time in Canada it was so awesome
but her books are so so great if you are
a chiclet van a women's fiction fan I
definitely suggest you read Meredith she
has a great fan base and definitely for
a reason but I was so so excited to read
novel East a girl because this is the
follow-up to blogger girl blogger girl
came out in 2014 I believe and I
reviewed that one and we meet Kimberly
long and basically she's like she's a
book blogger she's not like a book
blogger she has a book blogger and it
was just so fun for me to be able to
read as a book blogger because I felt
like I just really connected with her
but of course there's you know so much
more going on than just her being a book
blogger but then it was awesome because
in the follow-up and not Lisa girl you
know obviously were falling Kimberly
again but now she is trying to she's
written a novel and she's trying to get
it published so she's going through the
process of trying to find an agent and
that sort of thing and that was even
more exciting for me to read because not
only am I a book blogger but I am also
an author as well so it just feels like
him believe it and myself are just like
great friends
and it's just so much fun to be able to
read books like that and to be able to
see you know an experience from her
point of view but also in this book
there's definitely a lot going on with
kind of like Kim's enemy who has come
into play and like they're slowly
starting to become friends and your kind
of wondering what's going to happen
there and that affects her friendship
with her best friend and then in the
romance department that part was so good
and so well written I really enjoyed
being able to read all the scenes with
her boyfriend how they move forward how
they kind of like get stuck I just I
definitely enjoyed this so much
obviously I give it five stars but if
you are a book blogger these books you
definitely don't want to pass up and
there are so many bloggers turned
authors or you know somehow you're in
that sort of combination but definitely
check these out they are so wonderful
when is a review from Terry and it is at
the center of the world by Jacqueline
Sheehan think I'm saying that right now
let's see it says in New York Times
bestselling author Jacqueline Sheehan's
evocative and emotionally compelling
novel a mother and her adopted daughter
each embark on a journey of
self-discovery and a wake of a stunning
revelation this book sounds very like
okay let me just read this to you
because I don't feel like I need to read
those party it says how do i do you keep
a secret so huge that I could devastate
everyone you care about for Kate Malloy
the answer is simple one lie at the time
that's how she has protected her
daughter for more than a dozen years
shielding her from a terrible truth
Sofia a 15 year old soccer star living
in New England believed she was born in
Mexico and legally adopted by Kate but a
posthumous letter from her stepfather
tell Sofia a different story one of
civil unrest and bloodshed death-defying
heroism and a child smuggling harrowing
sacrifice and desperate decisions like
whoa doesn't that sound intense and
Terry clearly loved it she gave it five
stars definitely want to check out her
five star review for me I feel like I
had a really good January it's like
usually I have like one or two sprinkled
in here I feel like January oh it was
really my month it was my long month but
the next one is killing me softly and
this is by Kathryn our Beal I have ride
from
Catherine quite a bit before and killing
me softly I thought was such an
interesting read because I've talked a
lot about how I enjoy like magic in
books like a little bit of like magical
realism is the term that I like to use
the main character Sadie has like kind
of like a sixth sense like she kind of
gets these like premonitions and kind of
knows when things are going to happen
before they do but they always are
revolved around death so like someone
can say hey there's been a car accident
she's like oh I know someone said was
killed in that car accident like she
just knows those sort of things so it
was very interesting to me to be able to
read something like that to see how the
character to see how the author was able
to build this character up I am I really
really enjoyed that but really like the
big meat of the story is the
relationship between Sadie and her
sister and I mean I will just say like
wow it's very well written it's very
believable but it brings like it just
brought up so many emotions and that's
when I know I have to give a book a five
star review is when it brings out so
many different emotions in me like
happiness sadness anger frustration
absolute shock disbelief like there were
so many emotions that I would read while
reading about her sister the things that
she did what would go on in her mind her
actions that she took there's a big
mystery involved in here because her
sister actually goes missing people
think she might be dead sadie is the big
person of interest it just it really
like this took me through a lot of
different emotions and it's one that I
highly recommend and the last one is
also 5 stars from me because my month is
just so fabulous but this is the
juggling act this is by Carol Maloney
Scott this is booked three and the ROM
come on the edge series I have featured
the series here on YouTube before as
well but this is the third book I was so
happy to read it and of course I ended
up loving it this one we are following
Claire and Brandon they are a married
couple and they are just really at a
point where they are struggling in a
marriage right now Claire is I think
she's 8 years older than four
and in and she really struggles with
their she struggles with her age and
this always feeling so self-conscious
about being older you know what she
looks like all those sort of things but
also brandon is you know he's young he's
attractive he's in a band she feels very
insecure around their nanny she feels
very insecure around their neighbor and
she's just she just had a lot of
insecurities and it's really affecting
her her marriage her husband all of that
and things kind of come to a head when
she has to go to Key West for work but
she actually has to go with her
ex-boyfriend who was a co-worker and
some things happen in Key West some
things happened bike at home very
interesting to see what can happen when
lines of communication in a marriage
basically get shut off and while Claire
and Brandon I don't think they were ever
like truly trying to hurt one another
they were just trying to like protect
one another by not saying little details
or things like that but then when you
find them out it hurts even more and it
just really reinforced how important
communication can be in a marriage there
is a lot more going on than just thought
with us to me that was like the main
focal point of the book was their
marriage and how they are doing but
there is very it's like some very funny
scene as i mentioned in my review when
Claire accidentally takes an ambien eqs
like there's really funny moments there
they're studied in moments what a club
that she goes to there's some good
moments back at home there's also an
adoption process being played out
throughout the book as well and I really
enjoyed that I was kind of surprised by
how it ended and it kind of did it
different by surprise and it happened
very quickly the resolution to this but
I enjoyed it definitely a great read for
