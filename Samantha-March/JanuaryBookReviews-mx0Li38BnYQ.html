I'm going to be going through my January
book reviews so these are going to be
all the books that I reviewed on
chocolate plus in the month of january i
have recently posted the january book
favorites video and that is all of the
five star books that chocolate plus
reviewed in january both for myself and
my review team so i will leave that one
linked below as well because some of
these reviews i won't go in depth in
this video because i did in the junior a
favorites video so that will be linked
in the description box below but yeah if
you are interested in hearing what I
read in the month of January please keep
on going to be kind of tough to film it
because i'm filming it with legit my
laptop in my lap because of course our
surface doesn't work right now i swear i
say this in every video that i need the
surface for which is usually any like
book review type video so i can read
like the blurbs and stuff for you guys
it never works it just never works in
general I keep telling my husband I was
like I just want to get rid of it I hate
it oh I hate it so much so I literally
have my gigantic i won the laptop like a
huge screen that is sitting in my lap
right now so I can have some help what
I'm doing this so this should be
interesting book that I read and
reviewed in January is the view from
prince street this is by Mary Ellen
Taylor this is a part of her alexandria
series and i have read from that series
before someone's chiclet plus was asked
to review this book i decided to take it
on at the corner of king street is the
one that i have read from the Alexandra
series and I really liked it because
it's one of those books or the series
its future both in the past and the
present and those are some of my
favorite books to read so we kind of get
to go back and forth and see glimpses
into the past which I really enjoy I
will say I did enjoy out the corner of
King Street quite a bit the view from
Prince Street not quite as much it
seemed to start off a little bit slower
to me and for some reason like legit it
took me a couple chapters to realize we
were getting dual point of views and I
don't know why the characters seem to
like merge together for me but it was
after if you
after so I was like wait a second I
thought her job was this and then I
realized we were moving back and forth
between characters in the chapters like
well so I don't that that s why I'd kind
of like threw me off a little bit too
but I stuck with it and I'm glad that I
did because I did end up enjoying it
there's there's a little bit of like a
mystery i SPECT in there as well with a
death that both characters that were
getting point abuse from they are
impacted by this death and a little bit
of like mystery surrounding it and the
ending was pretty interesting to read
also the views from the past that were
getting I thought were super fun to read
about it because it kind of deals with
like witches witchcraft and I'm really
interested in that sort of thing as well
big charm fan right here yes indeed I'm
glad I stuck with it even though the
beginning was a little bit slower to me
I am glad because I ended up enjoying it
quite a bit and I give it 4 stars so
that's the view from Prince Street
another one that I read and reviewed is
the fooling thing and this is by Maggie
LePage I have also read from a kilo page
in the past and she came out with what
she called a Christmas quickie and so of
course I wanted to read that because I
did enjoy her books that i have read and
so this was just like a quick little
Christmas novella I tried to review it
as close to Christmas is like my review
when I'm january six but it definitely
is exactly what it says with the
Christmas quickie so it's another love
but I feel like she did a really fun job
of describing it because it definitely
is more on the mature side you need to
be a little bit older to read this book
because it does have quite a few steamy
scenes in there I ended up really really
liking this and I did give it a 4 so
review and sometimes novellas I kind of
like hit or miss for me but this one I
thought was super funny because I didn't
find it to be very like cliched like
sometimes holiday novellas can be like
this one just had me laughing I enjoyed
it the ending I didn't see coming
because I expected more of a cliche but
I was like yes this was a good one one
that I read and reviewed as you'll find
me in Manhattan and this is by gelled
map this is the final book in the series
and i believe i have read the other two
as well
and review them on chipola plus so I was
excited to read this and it just has
such a good chicklet feel to it I think
especially because it's set in New York
and for some reason like New York just
equals Chiclets books to me I don't know
why that is but I enjoyed it I do
recommend reading the series if you are
going to pick this one up because it
kind of took me a few chapters to get
back in the swing of things remember the
characters remember where we left off
you know one thing that I think I should
have done was probably gone back and
read my review of the first two books
because that could can help me get into
the third but it is a series that i
recommend but i would recommend getting
all the books and then reading them in
order but this one I really like the
aspects of friendship in this book and I
actually imagine miss Emory review but I
took a picture of my kindle at one point
and i posted the picture on Instagram
because there was a quote in there about
friendship that just really like
resonated with me and I thought that was
pretty cool so it definitely a good one
I gave it a 4 star review one that I
gave 5 stars2 is how to look happy by
see seaweed hour so be sure to check up
my January favorites video because if
you like Chiclets this is a really good
one for you another one that I gave five
starts to is a novel Lisa girl and this
is by mere the shore another really
great chiclet one if you are a book
blogger I think you would really enjoy
these books for Meredith and then even
if you are an author and a book blogger
or you have some sort of connection
between the two these are definitely
good books for you so again January book
favorites linked below wonder if you
guys can see the laptop in my lap I
don't have a viewfinder so I have no
idea what you guys are looking at but
just kind of wonder if you can see this
giant laptop sitting in my lab right now
by surface I just want to get rid of it
other one I read and reviewed is
matching eight-match me if you can and
this is bio Michelle Gorman and I've
mentioned Michelle quite a bit of my
channel she flips she puts out books at
a very quick pace I'm very jealous of
how she does it to me if you can
Michelle government is a big chiclet
writer and she is a
UK writer so sometimes it's kind of fun
reading the books and like seeing the
different language and even things like
different foods of things that are
mentioned in there so that's kind of fun
to read with just a heads up because
sometimes I can also kind of take me
back a minute but also when I read UK
books i find myself like talking like
them like i start using the word bloody
quite a bit like oh it's a bloody bad
day you know anyone else do that it's
kind of weird especially if i read like
several UK books in a row well you
better just get out of town I did enjoy
it I gave it four stars but again this
was one we're like the beginning I just
was like struggling to get into the
groove with it you know what i mean and
i mentioned in my review that I think
maybe there's like very short section
breaks like the content is broken up by
section breaks quite a bit and read
chapter breaks and I'm one I just
mentioned this in my reading habit tag
but like when i get to a section breaker
chapter break i can I feel ok with the
kindle down and i felt like maybe I kept
putting it down because the section
breaks were so fast like we get one page
of content and then there would be a
break and I don't know I think maybe
that kind of like kept taking me out of
the element of the book you know what
I'm saying i'm using my hands quite a
bit but I'm glad that I stuck with it in
kept reading because it was very cute it
was very Chiclets it was something that
i very much enjoy and it basically
follows three friends kind of looking
for love there's like a dating website
involved and it involves ex-boyfriends I
don't want to say too much because there
was a twist towards the end that I was
like I honestly didn't see that one
coming but I enjoyed it so that is match
me if you can feel like I read quite a
bit in January but another review i have
is a wild games this is by mila rossi
this was another novella and more on the
steamier side as well I will warn you of
that it sat in the rainforest of Costa
Rica and it definitely is a romance
between of the characters and at first I
wasn't sure if I want it to be the one
to review it because the cover was very
much like a romance cover and I'm not
like a straight romance girl and much
more on the chiclet
but the cover kind of gave me like a
Jane and Tarzan feel and I was like I
don't know if this is going to be the
best fit for me but I actually ended up
really enjoying it it's very fast-paced
very easy to be engaged with there's a
lot going on in it and it's fun that
sudden the rainforest Costa Rica like I
felt like I was learning stuff along
with the characters so that is wild
games and I gave it four stars another
one that I mentioned in my January
favorites is killing me softly and this
is by Katherine rbl this is a book that
featured a little bit of magical realism
so if you are into that i would suggest
checking this out in my January
favorites video another one in the
favorites I also mentioned in my beards
video that like January was just a super
good month for me I usually have like
one or two in the favorites videos and
the rest are from my review team and I
had so many in this review video like
January was my month but another one at
gate 5 stars2 is the juggling act and
this is by carolyn maloney Scott is
again a part of a series a series that I
definitely would recommend I'd read the
books in it and I enjoyed them all so
yeah five stars to the juggling act last
one I have is the exes in my glass and
this is by lisa m madsen and this is a
memoir and i really enjoyed it I wasn't
sure it would be for me but after I read
the synopsis because I don't read a lot
of memoirs but you can tell it's
definitely the memoir that I said it in
my haul video that it reminded me of
dangle carrot by Hilary grossman were
like it's a memoir but it reads like a
chick-lit novel and that's something
that I enjoy and I'm really glad that I
did pick it up each chapter is basically
focused on a man that lisa is dating and
what she happens to be drinking at this
time at Lisa in real life he works in
the wine industry and so it was
interesting to read like how she started
how she got out of a bad situation where
she moved to next what she got involved
in there and like see her grow grow well
the different love that she finds like
it was just very interesting to read and
ending I thought was really good I
really enjoyed it on a whole so even if
you're not a huge fan of memoirs if you
still if you want to read a memoir that
reads like fiction I would say
this was it so give this one of four
stars and like always all the books that
