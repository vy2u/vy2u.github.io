today I'm going to be doing another book
haul video and I don't think I've done a
haul video on youtube or even on
chocolate plus in like a really long
time because i have a lot of books to
talk about i haven't even decided how
many yet i'm going to share in this
video because i think i literally have
over 10 sitting on my shelf that i
haven't yet hauled either on here or on
chocolate plus so we'll just see how
fast i get through everything and that
will depend on how many books i share
but if you want to see the books that i
have gotten in the mail for review
lately please keep all the first i'm
going to share the print books that i
got in the mail I only have two of them
so the rest of this hall will be off of
my surface but the first one that I got
is center of gravity and this is by
laura mckee neill laura also writes
under the name lauren clark and i read a
lot from her and I really enjoyed her
book this one is a bit different than
the books that she writes under Lauren
Clark's I believe that's why she chose
to write on her different name I think
she classifies this as domestic suspense
which is very different from her other
books I can link you know one or two
over other books below so you can check
out with that genre her whole life Ava
Kirsten has been sure one thing she
doesn't measure up to her mother's
expectations so when Mitchell Carson
sweeps into her life with his adorable
son the ready-made family seems like a
dream come true and the blink of an eye
she's married has a new baby and life is
wonderful or is it especially when you
classify something as domestic suspense
I meet Lee get intrigued about it and I
absolutely love this cover I just love
the design we have going on here I think
it's very eye-catching so I look forward
to reading this one from Laura the next
one that I got I'm so super excited
about it because I'm sure you guys have
heard me talk a lot about Anita Hughes
I've mentioned to several for books on
here I just wrote her latest one French
coast and reviewed it and absolutely
loved it she's one of my favorite
authors so I just got an a RC of Rowan
love love the cover I mentioned in one
of my videos that I love her books
because we are often traveling there
we're going to new countries with her
and once again it appears maybe that
we're going to Rome in this book from
the author of Lake Como
the story of a young actress who Lance
the lead in a film that is shooting in
Rome bringing about difficult life
choices new friendships and a chance at
love love this cover love Anita I'm so
excited that I got an advanced reading
copy and very appreciative of it so this
review will be coming soon okay the next
one that i have is absolutely true lies
and this is by rachel schooler doler and
i love this cover i think the sunglasses
are so cute i love the title because
that's very catching as well pledging
entertainment writer stumbles into the
gig of a lifetime writing a teenage pop
stars memoir and soon realizes that the
young celebrities squeaky-clean image is
purely a work of fiction so i got this
one with CLP blog tours and my review
will be running in august for that the
next one that I have to share is
jaywalking and this is by Tracy creamer
and I'd love Tracy she is a friend of
mine on social media and I'm chatting
with her all the time really excited
because she's sent me a copy of
jaywalking the book is on pre-order
right now on amazon and it releases on
August fourth the first paragraph reads
Chelsea Wyatt a single mom trying to
build a life for her and her son is sick
of the body she sees in the mirror a
daily diet of Chris cereal is not doing
wonders for her mood or her figure and
it's time for a change setting out to
get fit she can miss herself to a daily
walking plan forcing herself to give up
her all sugar and carb diet a typical
task at her donut obsessed job so right
away I know I was already smiling while
I was reading that because that just
sounds like a fun book to read it sounds
like something that I'm going to really
enjoy you get into tracy for sending me
a copy of my review will be running
things dealer the first or the second
week in august real close to the release
date so again that one is jay walking by
tracy creamer and it is available for
pre-order now on amazon the next one i
have to talk about is the patrons and
this is by daniela Brodsky and I've read
quite a few from Daniela she is also the
author of Diary of a working girl it
says here in her bio it was adapted for
the screen by Disney
stars Hilary Duff and I remember reading
the book loving it reviewed it for
Chiklis I can leave that below and then
I am on Daniela's email list and it came
out that the book was going to be turned
into this and it was going to start
Hilary Duff who I really love because
like who my age didn't watch the lizzie
mcguire shell on disney back in the day
so i got excited over that and i think
i've read every other book from daniela
so far that she's put out so she just
emailed me a few weeks back and said her
new one the patrons was coming out and I
was just like yes I have to read it it
starts off with it's a simple exchange
but it changes everything this is my
card he said you call me whenever you
need to a saucy romp through the
nation's capital is the most
entertaining way yet to take the topic
of starving artistry to a practical raw
level maybe in the old days they have it
right if you want to make pure quality
art what you need is a patron well that
does sound interesting so this one is
from Daniela Brodsky and it is the
patrons next one that I have is the
triple with dying and this is by Maggie
LePage this is another friend of mine on
social media because I am an author as
well I belong to a lot of different
author groups especially on facebook
it's really easy to you know make your
groups and like your secret groups and
hidden groups and all that and I belong
to several with authors and you know
because I know that I run chicklet plus
and reviews and I have a review team I
get asked a lot through those groups to
read and review books as well and I'm
always happy to do so and a lot of times
I really make connections with the
authors and so I want to be the one to
read their book so those are a lot of
these books that have been coming from
lately as well because it seems like
more groups are kind of popping up
because the thing is it seems like
especially in the indie world it's very
popular dog to kind of like group
together and help each other out you are
an indie author and you're looking for
an outlet or just other people to
connect to I recommend getting on
facebook and seeing if you can find any
groups that will
to with other authors because it is a
really great support system to have but
anyways back to the book this is the
trouble with dying by Maggie LePage
first paragraph is when faith Carson
wakes up on a hospital ceiling looking
down on her body in a coma that's a bad
start to the week a very bad start she
has no idea who she is or how she got
there are why and the biggest mystery of
all is why she married the schmuck who
wants her ventilator switched off so my
first thought is that sounds like some
pretty serious stuff but the way it's
written is also very funny so seems to
me like could be a serious book but with
humor in it as well as I was reading
that first paragraph and it says she
wakes up on a hospital ceiling I could
have tripped over my words because I was
like wait am I saying that right I don't
think that's right but as I kept reading
it makes sense so the trouble with dying
by making the page my review will also
be going up in August and then I just
have one or book to talk about and then
I'll wrap this video up hopefully it
wasn't as long as I maybe thought it was
in the beginning but I've been trying to
get the room as fast as again but the
last one that I have is the summertime
girls and this is by Laura Hankin and I
like this because there's a tag line on
the cover and it says best friends
forever only last so long and I love
books about friendship I've written
books about friendship so that got me
into it right away when two lifelong
friends reunite for one more summer in
small town main they must bridge the gap
caused by the dreams and secrets that
tore them apart so this bug is one
hundred percent up my alley I remember
getting the email from penguin asking if
we wanted to review it on chocolate plus
how to read over the synopsis and I
looked over the cover and I was like yes
this is a book that screams my name so
the book is on pre-order now on amazon
and it also releases on August fourth
that would mean that my review for it
will probably run again writer on that
first and second week of august i think
the majority of the books that i talked
about will be running in early august
right around the release dates a lot of
good books coming up on my shelf i'm
excited to read them some from you
lathers some from authors that I love
some from my author friends so I'm
looking forward to reading all of those
I hope this helped your summer reading
list if you're looking for some more
books to read as we kind of wind down
the summer didn't we just start summer
isn't that so sad were already winding
down this summer we went to Lima has
been went to target the other day and
they already have their school section
filled out like that in school just get
out and I could've swore I just heard
about the last day of school but what do
you do summer is always too short but I
hope this video gave you some new ideas
for summer reads i will link everything
that i talked about in the description
box below so be sure to check that out i
hope you enjoyed this haul video please
