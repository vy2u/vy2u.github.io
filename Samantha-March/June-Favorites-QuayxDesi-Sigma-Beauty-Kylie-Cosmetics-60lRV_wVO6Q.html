today's video is going to be my June
favorites I always enjoy doing favorites
videos because it's a great way just to
wrap up everything that I've been loving
on in the month of june i have some new
products to share with you guys and then
I actually have a couple like oldies but
goodies like products that I've had for
a while but now I'm recently like can't
stop putting on my face if you know what
I mean but yeah I think we have a pretty
good selection of this month so if you'd
like to see all my June favorites please
keep watching my first favorite is going
to be not actually beauty related it's
going to be a book if you guys do not
know my career what I do full-time is
that I'm an author and I also own a
publishing company so my publishing
company marching in could release a book
on jun 22nd so obviously I want to
mention it and of course it's a huge
favorite of mine because I absolutely
love what I do I love that this is my
full-time job and that I get to work
with books and authors every single day
i just feel incredibly lucky so the book
that we released is all access and I do
actually have a full video going over
out access in the release day I posted
it on the actual release day so I can
leave that link below if you guys are
interested in all in books or books that
I happen to release that sort of thing I
do talk about I'll access in there this
is a debut novel which of course is so
exciting as always but in the video i
also talked about three new audio books
that we just released and one of them is
my latest book called up to i do that i
released last year it just came out in
audio book form so if you're interested
in audio books as well i can leave those
linked below i have a free trial with
audible if you guys want to try out
audio books for the first time that's
all in there but yes very excited for
liberty if you guys like romance or
reading about like Hollywood romance
normal girl dating a celebrity rock star
mm-hmm check out all access so a big
favorite this past month is a little bit
surprising to me too bird desi Perkins
she came out with a sunglass
collaboration with key Australia so I
had been super interested in purchasing
from key Australia I actually almost
purchased from them last summer then I
just wasn't sure i'm not a big sunglass
person you guys
honestly I own two pairs of sunglasses
one is like a really cheap plastic pink
pair that I wear like when we got on the
water views meant parks and stuff those
are the glasses i bring because i don't
care if i lose them if they break
whatever and then i have a pair of
aviators that were also only nine
dollars that i wear in everyday life so
i just i was a little bit worried about
purchasing the sunglasses so i didn't do
it last year and then i was going to do
it again this year i was like no i'm
going to make a purchase like I want a
nice pair of sunglasses like and then it
was like two weeks after I decided I'm
gonna place the order I'd been looking
on the website that does he came out and
said hey I'm doing a sunglass collab
with key and I was like okay I'm just
gonna wait for her sunglasses to come
out and thought it was like two months
later I felt like it was forever until
the sunglasses actually came out but I
did order to bears what is interesting
about this is that i ordered to in hopes
that I would like them both but I truly
didn't think I would and I thought I can
do one for a giveaway I can put it in
like a future giveaway and i purchased
on the low and i purchase high key and
gold and i figured i'm going to love
high key I'm gonna wear Hecky every day
they're like oversized aviators like
that's awesome the on the low is like
big black mat ahead bitch bungalow so
this is how I would describe them and
I'm like clearly I'm probably not gonna
like those but those would be fun for a
giveaway like that'd be a good time
right and so I get the sunglasses and
I'm trying them on and I'm like um on
the low like turns me into another
person well these sunglasses are very
big like I feel like I can just barely
pull them off like these aren't
typically like what I would wear on an
everyday basis but I truly do love them
like I just think they are super cool
looking and I fell in love with them
like the minute I put them on I was like
I love these sunglasses and I did not
expect to like I don't know I just think
they are super cool looking and I can
stop wearing them I love them even my
husband wears them like we just think
they're really cool so I'm keeping these
but then I'm trying on the Heike and
gold the pair that I accept
good to just absolutely fall in love
with and they are also very large but
they just like do not look right on my
face because they are so big and I not
only do i have a small face but I have a
very like narrow face so these glasses
unfortunately do not work out for me
like do you see what I mean like they're
so far this white like my face is down
here and the sun glasses come out so far
and I'm like um I don't think these are
going to work so I feel a little
ridiculous wearing them I actually have
not been able to wear them out like I
don't even feel confident to wear them
out in public like I kind of feel that
way was on the low but not really
because they like for whatever reason
like give me a confidence boost where
these I think I just kind of look silly
in so I actually asked my snapchat fam I
was like what do you guys think should i
keep them can I rock them what do you
guys think and honestly the feedback was
kind of like 5050 this is the reason why
sunglasses are hard for me to buy
because of my face shape so
unfortunately these glasses did not work
out for me but I also asked my snapchat
squad would you guys want to see these
in a future giveaway I'm going to be
giving away these pair of gold heike
from desi vecchia Australia in my 5000
youtube subscriber giveaway that is the
next giveaway that i'm going to do we
just celebrated two thousand and now
we're on our way to 4,000 hopefully will
be 25 k in no time i'm currently putting
together packages for that give away
because there will be two winners and in
one of those winters boxes you will get
high key from desi so if you want to see
that give away soon make sure you're
subscribed share with your friends it's
gonna be awesome I'll be able to win
these very very soon I'm excited for you
but even though this pair did not work
out for me I still think they're super
cute I've been seeing everyone's
pictures they look so good but on below
I fell in love what I'm completely
obsessed with these glasses and I'm
super happy that I decided to get them
ok now that we just talked about
sunglasses for like eight thousand years
good load I'm so sorry so moving on I do
have a piece of clothing that I want to
talk to you guys about
and it is just a bandeau so looks like
this so this is just like a bandeau bra
top my sister-in-law step actually gave
this to me in like a mother's day
package I don't have earned a Mother's
Day gift I don't have children but I
have a dog and I take my my dog mom duty
very very seriously but she owns the the
clothing store topple off clothing which
I've talked about all the time I wear so
many different clothes from topple off
and just always talking about him i love
the store it's the number one plays that
I shop so I will leave that linked down
below but she has a bunch of these
bandos and she gave one to myself I
don't have any and I was like okay you
know that's cool i'll try it out
obsessed with it like I can't stop
wearing it this is so so comfortable I
think it's awesome but I just think it
is super comfortable it's really nice to
wear undershirts where you know you
don't want to wear a regular bra but you
don't like the look of a strapless bra
like if you can kind of see through the
shirt still sometimes I don't like the
look of like a regular strapless bra but
if you put this on like it's like the
perfect solution I think it's amazing
there's so many times where i'm just
lounging around the house in this I just
I can't get over how comfortable it is I
believe that she has a lot of different
like colors and styles of the bando so i
will try to find them and leave them
link below but i don't know this is like
a new summer staple for me and loved it
thank you steph and then moving along i
have two things from sigma beauty to
talk about the first one is there like
Sigma's spot glove it looks like this so
I've mentioned this in like a sigma ha
that I did and also in my brush cleaning
video but man oh man i cannot get over
how much better this has made my brush
cleaning not only for actually cleaning
the brushes foot for wanting to clean my
brushes cleaning makeup brushes is not a
fun task I think that everyone feels
that way most of us maybe but this just
makes it so much easier and that what I
do have to go Mike go to clean my
brushes I'm like you know what actually
it's not that bad because this makes it
so much easier and before what I was
doing was literally just rubbing the
brushes on my palm and on my fingers and
by the time you're done with like three
brushes like your hand just feels
disgusting and looks
testing and comfortable and it's not a
lot of fun with this it's so easy
because you can actually like slip it on
your hand like this and clean it or
sometimes like I'll just hold it
regularly and clean the brushes it has
these different like bridges and grooves
on there for different brushes and
different like cleaning purposes and it
just makes cleaning brushes so much
easier I feel like this is like a
must-have and then a brush that I want
to talk about from Sigma is the medium
sweeper be 54 brush it looks like this I
didn't even realize it like throughout
the month I keep a list on my phone of
favorites that I want to mention because
if I don't like by the time I get to the
end of the month I'm like what is it
that I've been using a lot and it's just
kind of hard to like make a list so I've
been doing it throughout the month now
and that's just so much more helpful and
for some reason i did not even think of
this until like the day before i'm
filming this video and i was doing my
makeup and of course I reach for this
brush again and I thought to myself wait
why didn't I put this on my list yet
like this has to go on here i have used
this brush almost every single time that
I have done my eye makeup it's the brush
that I use to apply product onto my lid
and I just absolutely love it I mean I
feel like I have a couple brushes that
are similar to this to like the flat
shader brush type of deal but for
whatever reasons this is just the brush
that I keep gravitating towards and I
just think it does a great job so if
you're looking for just good old regular
eyeshadow brush the sigma e 54 has
become a favorite so a couple skincare
products to talk about one I don't think
I've mentioned in a favorites video yet
but it's from Mario Badescu in his the
drying lotion so this was definitely I
didn't put this in my youtube made me
buy it but I should because YouTube
definitely made me buy this product so
many people started talking about it I
always see it on people's snapchats if
they're using it I was like well I want
to try it too and maybe the reason that
I didn't try it or that I didn't mention
it in the video right away is because i
bought this one also was having their
like summer sale or whatever and one day
everything from mario badescu was like
fifteen or twenty five percent off or
something like that and i bought this
because why you use it is basically to
like ward off breakouts so if you start
to get breakout on your skin you're
supposed to be able to take a q-tip
in here Pat it on your skin on where the
breakout is go to sleep and its supposed
to like zap it and I was like okay you
know I want to try it out so I bought
this and proceeded it not to break out
for over a month no lie I was like what
I just needed to have this in my cabinet
to like scare break outs away from my
skin like what is going on and I was
like you know I'm not complaining that
i'm not bringing out i do think it's
kind of strange but like i wanted to try
out this product and be able to review
it and i simply can't do it and then i
got a breakout know the first night that
I saw that it was coming I was like oh
I'm going to get you and oh did I get it
so I am NOT going to say that you use
this one night when you wake up your
skin is completely blemish-free it's
completely gone that's not the case what
I will say that it's good for is that
when you put it on like when you first
see the breakout and you put it on there
and sleep with it it prevents the
breakout from actually like going
anywhere does that make sense it
prevents the breakout from actually like
breaking your skin out I don't know I'd
seriously I don't know how to explain it
but it like stops it in its track you
know like usually when I have a breakout
I see it and then the next day it's
bigger and then the next day is like
full blown and then it takes a couple
days to like calm down this just zap sit
and within I would say two days then the
blemish is completely gone so it never
actually like fully gets there it just
mix it away so i don't know i love it
everytime i see breakout this is the
first thing that i do i've now come to
travel with it well i'm traveling i'm
like got to use it I've had my husband
use it and he agrees with me like we're
all about this it's pretty bomb so
another skincare to talk about is from
gagne and it is a sleeping cream it's
our ultralift miracle sleeping cream it
supposed to be anti-fatigue night cream
this is what it looks like i bought this
when Garnier was having a sale at CBS
this is what it looks like on the inside
so I know it looks like i have not used
any if you look at this but it is like
the most bizarre thing i used it the
first night and then the second night I
went to use it again and I was like wait
a second why doesn't it look like i used
it i don't know what exactly it is about
this product or what is in this product
but even after you
use it the next night when you go to
open it again everything is like smooth
and spread out again I don't know when
it's going to start to happen that it's
going to look like I'm actually using
this product because so far it's not
it's like kind of weirding me out but
that's neat but I really like the way
that it smelled it has like a very like
calming sent to me which I appreciate at
night especially because I think maybe
it's because like i'ma i don't know if i
want to say creative person or what it
is but i have a lot of trouble falling
asleep because my mind is always racing
i'm always thinking about what I could
be doing or should be doing or list to
make or it just it's hard for me to fall
asleep and so I I feel like this scent
of this is almost like a relaxing
soothing scent which almost kind of
helps me sleep which is like an added
bonus which is really cool but it's very
lightweight and very moisturizing on the
skin which I appreciate it's not heavy
at all like I use the first aid beauty
sleeping cream as well and that is a
very very heavy cream this one is not
it's very lightweight so this is what
I've been using in the summer like I've
been grabbing this over my first aid
beauty which is really surprising to me
because I love for save beauty but I
feel like in the summer like I just need
something a little bit lighter on my
skin so that's why I keep reaching for
this one and I've been loving it so I
have a few different lip products to
talk about and one is from covergirl and
it's there Oh sugar lip balm looks like
this I have mine in the shade one which
is cupcake and I bought this like mine
is almost gone can you tell i only
bought this like two months ago but that
just shows you like how much i use this
because i use it all the time I just
always have it sitting next to my desk
but I'm a big fan of just keeping my
lips as moisturised as I can say a lot
of different liquid lipsticks and I'm
always trying to use either like a scrub
or just keeping my lips moisturized and
I need it something new to keep I my
desk like I have a lip balm in my
bathroom drawer I have a lip balm in my
purse and I always have one next to my
desk as well this is the one that's been
next to my desk and I'm just going
through it like crazy I think it makes
the lips feel so like hydrated and
refreshed and I've just been loving it
I'm definitely going to repurchase this
from my desk once i'm done with it I
like cupcake because it doesn't have any
sort of like real tint to it I don't
think at least not my
it's just a sheer bomb which you know
I'm not looking for a lip gloss or not
looking for anything like tinted ER with
color because I just want it when I'm
sitting at my computer working i just
want there to be like moisture on my
lips so this was a good one a couple of
liquid lipsticks to talk about I have
two from Anastasia Beverly Hills one is
in Catherine and one is in Dulce so I do
really love these colors alone by
themselves I wear them and I like them
but I actually found that I like
combining them a lot more what I do
typically is like basically line my lips
with Catherine which is like a deeper
berry kind of like a deeper brown Barry
I kind of like line my lips and fill in
like the corners with them and then I
take Dulce and then I fill in the rest
of my lips and I think it makes such a
really cool shade I actually did do an
Instagram video showing how I kind of do
it I can try to find it so I can link
that below if you guys want to see how I
do the two it really wasn't sure what I
was doing like it was something that I
just wanted to try and I decided to film
it and as I was like lighting my lips
with Catherine I was like this is not
going to turn out well like what am i
doing and then I put the Dulce on there
like I was like just keep it going just
sometimes make it looks weird in the
process of it you just got to get to the
end result I put Bill's late in there
which Dulce is like a mutant quarrel I
think is what the website calls it and I
just loved the result and so many people
loved it I don't know if I've ever got
more questions of what lip color I was
wearing it was so cool but yeah
Catherine and Dulce from Anastasia
Beverly Hills I love them separately but
I love them even more together another
liquid lipstick that I really enjoy is
from Kylie cosmetics and it is in candy
k now I grabbed the lip liner out
because it comes with the lip liner it
has each of Kylie's liquid lipsticks
comment with a matching lip liner now
truly if they were sold separately and
like you needed to buy the liner
separately i would not buy this liner
it's the exact same formula as
colour-pop literally this is a color pop
lip liner which the colour-pop lip
liners are five dollars they're the same
I
find myself reaching for my color pop
liners more than I do for this one
because I just think it's kind of weird
that they're the exact same formula
that's a little odd but it does come
with the lip liners you don't have an
option to purchase them separately or
save a little bit money on these
ridiculously overpriced liquid lipsticks
and shipping but I don't know comes with
this i thought i would share it but i
really really do like her liquid
lipstick in the shade candy k it's a
very nice like wearable every day nude
pink color and i really enjoy it it's
not what i'm wearing on my lips today
I'm actually wearing clueless from
colour-pop I don't think these colors
are similar I actually went through
likes watched a lot in my collection
trying to find like a dupe for this one
and I was not able to find one and I
have a lot of pink nudes especially from
colour-pop and I couldn't really find a
comparable dupe for it but I really like
this formula because i think it is super
super super long-lasting like it really
this is the most long-lasting liquid
lipstick that i have in my collection
hands down they are very pricey its
twenty nine dollars you are getting a
lip liner with it but on top of it you
have to pay like nine or ten dollars
shipping which i think is absolute
portion and i seriously confused why
kylie jenner needs to charge people ten
dollars to ship a lipstick but uh one of
the world's greatest mysteries i have
not repurchase anything else from kylie
i bought this and her three lip glosses
all in one order because i wanted to
review the lip glosses when they first
came out for youtube and i did i have
not purchased anything else from her
she's come out with metallic lipsticks
and more shades and even though I i
truly do like the formula i can't get
behind the prices and i can't get behind
the shipping so I've just not been able
to bite the bullet to buy war but I
really really do like this formula and I
find myself wearing it all the time so
it is a favorite for that reason it's
just hard to spend that kind of money a
mascara that I want to talk about is
from benefit it is the roller lash
mascara and owe me an I love this
mascara I was so excited because benefit
recently sent me like a PR package which
I was like so grateful and appreciative
for i actually did share it in a recent
haul video i went through what
the different items that they sent me
and I just wanted to talk about this
because I have heard so many people say
great things about the roller lash and I
just was never able to try it out so
when I saw that they had sent that to me
I was so excited and yeah it gets the
hype for a good reason I think it's
awesome I've been reaching for it so
much not only I think it does a really
good job of lengthening the lashes and
adding a curl to them which i don't
think i have a mascara that does that I
don't think it's super great at like
volumizing so if you want like thick
lashes I don't think this is going to be
what you need but I really appreciate
the length and the curl that it gives
and yeah I just think it's the cutest
how like how cute is this packaging I
think it's the cutest and I just really
enjoy it finish with am I like oldies
booked new favorite goodies products
that I want to talk about the first is a
BB cream this is from Maybelline it's
their dream fresh bb-8 and one beauty
balm skin Perfector it looks like this
and using this so much like when I don't
want to do like heavy foundation I just
want something to like kind of like even
out my skin tone give me a nice looking
glow this is what I use I'm a huge fan
of BB creams in the summertime when I
don't like to wear a lot of heavy makeup
and this is just like my number one BB
cream I just mentioned it in my
drugstore must-haves because I truly
think it is a must-have and I just been
loving it so another one is a foundation
this was like a favorite foundation when
I first got it and I've just I've always
loved this foundation but recently I
find myself reaching for it almost every
single day like to the point where I'm
like use a different foundation you've
worn that the last four days like you
something else but it's from l'oreal
it's the true match lumi this is another
one that i mentioned in my drugstore
must-haves i absolutely love this
foundation it gives a nice like medium
coverage and makes your skin luminous
looking which I really appreciate but it
also does not feel suffocating or heavy
on the skin which I love it's just one
of my favorite foundations and I cannot
stop reaching for it I cannot and then
the last one is from to face it's their
chocolate soleil bronzer I have like a
little sample guy of this and I've had
it for probably a year and I feel like
it's not going anywhere but I've been
wearing it almost every single day I had
like a few different other like bronzers
and especially like the wet wild
contouring
that I was using all the time I could
not stop using that but then I one day I
reached for this I was like oh I haven't
worn this in a while and i just
remembered how much I truly truly love
this browser and now I can't put it down
again another product that I've had in
my collection for a very long time but
this past month I just cannot stop
wearing it to love it everything for my
