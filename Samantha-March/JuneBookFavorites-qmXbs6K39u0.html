going to be part 2 of my June favorites
and it is going to be the book edition
so I am going to talk about every book
on chocolate plus that received a five
star review in the month of june I
believe we have nine books to talk about
by got five stars from either myself or
one of my reviewers on my review team so
if you want to see the CLP favorites for
the month of june please keep watching
the first book that we have is sweet
forgiveness and this is by lori nelson
feel minh and this review came from alli
and she gave it the five star review it
says here on amazon from the number one
international best-selling author lori
nelson Spielman follows the life list
with sweet forgiveness in which a
woman's receipt of to forgiveness stones
sends her searching for atonement so
that one was from ally that was bright
at the beginning of june that her review
went up and i will leave the link to her
review plus the amazon link in the
description box that we have is it's you
by jane porter and this is another one
that Ali reviewed I'm a huge fan of Jane
Porter and i'm trying to think back like
what was I doing as beginning a June
that I couldn't review one of Jane's
books because i think i've read like so
many of her books and i think she is
such a terrific author vocal on social
media like whenever i send a tweet with
her she responds and i sent one out the
other day i don't know if i was talking
about cleaning my office or maybe like
some food i was eating but she responded
no i think it was about cleaning my
makeup brushes and she talked about
cleaning her makeup brushes and we just
had a whole conversation about that so
that's so much fun when an author
especially one who's a little bit more
well known and you know how busy they
are because she puts out books so often
but she can take a moment and talk with
someone on social media I just think
that's very cool so it's you by Jane
Porter also received a five star review
on Chiclets plus in the month of june i
have to talk about is love at first
flight and this is from test woods and
I reviewed this one and I gave it five
stars and I have absolutely raved about
this book since I read it it was I think
it was just an another review video that
I will find and i will link to it below
but I went into like a huge long spiel
about how much I loved this book and I
really really like Tess woods she's so
nice she's such a sweet person when she
saw my review go up she emailed me about
it and then when she saw this video go
up that I was talking about her book she
sent me another really nice message just
saying you know how appreciative she was
of I think that is so nice for someone
to take their time out because even as
many book reviews that chocolate plus
goes up I mean I would say seventy to
eighty percent of the authors don't say
anything back to us they don't say thank
you we don't get an email saying you
know thank you for taking your time so
that's kind of turned into the norm I
don't expect it any more for when we run
reviews or we talk about an author
online or I talk about someone in a
YouTube video I don't expect anyone to
be like oh hey thanks for mentioning to
me like I just don't expect it anymore
so when someone does it always kind of
throws me off and I'm like oh well
you're I don't want to say that I
expect people to do it because you know
most the time we're getting asked by
those authors if we do it and we say yes
and you know it's our commitment that
we're giving so not that I don't want to
say like over just doing this for fun
and you need to thank us because you
know chicklet plus is one of my jobs
it's just a job it's a commitment that
I've said of doing so I mean obviously I
don't SPECT people to send me chocolate
and goodies every time I do a book
review or do I know but that was very
sweet and this book I'll you know of
course i'll leave my review below i'll
find that video where I kind of go in a
little bit more in depth about it as
well but absolutely hands-down one of my
favorites that I write up the year and
this is Tessa's debut novel which also
i'm just like amazing job test amazing
job the next one that we have is the
seventh day of May and this is by to the
fray
and Annie reviewed this book and let's
see the first paragraph reads Jenna's
life may be dire but it's normal until a
ghost shows up and causes chaos so anti
reviewed this one and I'm sorry if you
can hear all that noise my husband is
literally right outside the window
mowing the lawn right outside the window
like right larious like this video I'm
sure I'm going to get like all kinds of
comments about how tired I look I have
not even been awake for an hour but woke
up ate some breakfast and my husband was
like I'm gonna go mow the lawn and I'm
like okay then I'm gonna record a video
real fast I have like basically zero
makeup on I have a little bit of bronzer
and I like through some eyeshadow and
mascara on I always wear eyeliner I
don't have eyeliner on I feel like when
I don't wear eyeliner I look really
young and I look really tired so but I
really wanted to get this video recorded
so I can get it up in a timely manner so
that's what we're rolling with today so
right outside right outside the window
so the seventh day of May by Pippa
Franks and I gave that one a five star
review on Chiklis in June links will be
below of course for this chick lit book
we're about halfway through and the next
one is the separation by deena Jeffries
and Annie reviewed this one and in her
review her very first line it said
gripping from the first page and she
also called it stunning so very high
remarks from Annie it says the
separation by deena Jeffries is a
sweeping novel set in 1950s malaya about
a mother searching for her daughters so
that is another one that got five big ol
stars from Annie on chick lo + o links
will be below of course the next one is
a five star review from me and it is for
the sant'angelo by Jackie Collins I'm a
huge fan of Jackie Collins I've read I
mean how many books does this woman even
have out
because it's like a trillion but I
brought a lot of them and this is the
latest minus listing tangelos everyone
on sale on june sixteenth it is a big
book like when i opened the package that
came with this book i was like i'm sorry
but this is how it's gonna take me like
a month to read this book i think it
took me like two days and i'm not even
kidding maybe it was closer to like the
three-day side but it reads so fast
format it's in a lot of jackie's books
but it's like very short clips like
short chapters short section breaks
things like that so it just makes it so
fast to read through it really fast if
you haven't read anything from the San
tangelos really recommend them because
they are so good so this is the scene
tangelos by Jackie Collins the next book
to get five stars is the wedding virus
and other snippets and this is by
Natalie shell this review also came from
Annie and she said in her review that
the story is like having a conversation
with a good friend on amazon it says the
wedding virus is a term that describes
how all things love and marriage seemed
to spread like a virus across groups of
friends and women regardless of location
or status candid fun optimistic and at
times downright embarrassing this book
offers an insightful look into topics of
love engagement weddings sex and other
scribbles about women really good
description because I was laughing while
I was reading that because that just
sounds very true and sounds like a very
fun chicklet read so be sure to check
that one out as Annie also gave it five
stars and almost done we just have two
more to talk about the next one is the
lake season and this is by Hannah
MacKinnon and this is yet another review
by Annie she had a really good June
selection this month she's my reviewer
that reads the most on chocolate plus i
can say she is a very avid reader a
highly we share a love of minions which
might sound very strange but me and my
girlfriend's dressed up as minions for
halloween this past october and since
then we've all just become like totally
obsessed with minions I can't wait to go
see the movie but Annie my good friend
Ed she likes minions to and we talk
through email a lot we also talk about
books too but yeah minions seem to work
their way into the conversations so
anyways this is a leg season by Hannah
McKinnon got five stars from Annie so on
Amazon it says Standish has always been
the responsible older sibling the one
with the study marriage love and family
and sensible job but all of a sudden is
her carefully constructed life spins out
of control a cryptic postcard from her
estranged sister Leah arrives at the
perfect time please come iris seizes her
chance to escape to her childhood
lakeside home where leah is planning her
summer wedding to a mandar New Hampshire
clan has never met so that is the lake
season Hannah was also very kind on
Twitter to give Annie and chocolate plus
a shout out and say thank you for
reading her book so thank you very much
Hannah and I think this one is a
beautiful cover and the synopsis sounds
very intriguing as well and I know Andy
mentioned in her review she talks about
like the beautiful backdrop of the lakes
and the beautiful scenery that is
written in the book and I absolutely
love when authors can really paint those
visuals for you in their books and make
you feel like you're there with them so
that one is the lake season by Hannah
McKinnon and the very last one I have to
talk about is another five-star from me
and this is dying brand by Wendy Tyson
and this is more on the mystery side of
books is an Alison Campbell mystery I
have read all of the other outs in
campbell mystery books as well and i can
leave links below to all of those books
and so from the back it says when image
consultant Alison Campbell attends an
award ceremony to honor a designer
friend she's thrust into a murder
investigation only this time it's
personal one of her ex-boyfriend's has
been murdered and she is tied with it
because for some reason that we do not
know he had Alison's name written into
his planner and so she is kind of under
a lot of scrutiny as you know why was he
meeting her why were they still talking
I almost dropped the book off my lap
whoa that could have been a disaster I
really need to take a picture you guys
of my set up for what I film because it
is so freaking chemical I record off my
camera but I sit on these like real high
stools that we have
offer our kitchen island so I have I'm
sitting on one stool but then the other
Souls across from me I have probably ten
bucks stacked up and then i have my nail
polishes are all in like a real high
canister that I think is used for like
the kitchen for like sugar or something
like that but I put my nail polishes in
it that is on top of the books on top of
that is a large box that actually have
it's something to do with the Chicago
Cubs it has like a bobblehead doll in it
but it's a real tall box and then on top
of that is my phone so this book just
went sliding off my lap almost right
towards where my setup is and that could
have been a huge disaster but I really
do need to take picture of that because
it's kind of a circle how I film I
really need to get a nice camera one of
these days I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do
it but anyways back to the book I love a
good mystery books I love wendy tysons
books like I said everything in the
Allison Kimball series I think I've
absolutely loved so far this one was no
exception it's very interesting to be
able to follow allison around especially
in this one because it was more on the
personal side for her not only because
it was someone she knew but then also
it's something that she's involved in
and she also kind of starts getting like
blackmailed throughout the book as well
and that part was really intriguing to
read about so i gave that one five stars
all the links will be below and i hope
you can check it out so that's all the
books that we have I think there was
nine but don't quote me on that but we
had a really great month in June if our
