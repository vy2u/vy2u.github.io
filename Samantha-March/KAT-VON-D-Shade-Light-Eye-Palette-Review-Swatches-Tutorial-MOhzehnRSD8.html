really glad that you are here today
because I'm going to be doing my second
ever makeup tutorial and I'm going to be
giving my in-depth review and swatches a
Kat Von D shade + light eye palette so I
mentioned this in my most recent
favorites video I talked about it in my
Sephora haul and I really really love
this palette I think you can do a lot of
great looks with it so I asked you guys
if you maybe would want to see the
in-depth review on the palette and then
also a makeup tutorial and the response
was yes which mean you really excited so
this is the look that I came up with
today
mochi I slightly blown out not quite as
much as like a really crazy blowing out
smokey eye but this is my version of my
blown out smokey eye and I used a lot of
the Browns from the palette so I don't
know what I'm gonna call it yet but I
don't know it's a brown blown-out smokey
eye in my eyes so again this is the look
that I created for you guys some false
eyelashes which I was super nervous to
apply on camera but we did it we've made
it made it through and I'm just really
excited to bring you something a little
bit newer to the channel I was really
nervous when I did my first makeup
tutorial and today I'm really bummed out
because it has been raining literally
since 4 a.m. this morning it's now 4
p.m. but it started storming at 4 a.m.
this morning and the rain has not lit up
we have not seen the Sun once I've gone
on no walks with my dog it's been cloudy
and overcast so I honestly don't think
the quality of this video is going to be
very good at all because my lighting
absolutely sucked which really sucks
when you're doing a makeup tutorial but
I really wanted to get this up for you
guys because I've been talking about it
so much and I've recently been starting
to get questions about like when is this
video coming so I really wanted to get
it up here for you guys and I don't
think I can film at all the rest of the
week because we are just so busy we're
going on another vacation this weekend
we just got back from 3 days in Chicago
and now I'm going to Kansas City this
weekend for another concert we're going
to go see the Foo Fighters so I just
really wanted to get this filmed enough
for you guys so I'm sorry the weather
just wanted to not cooperate with me but
first I'm going to jump into the review
on the palette and show you
all the different shades and let you
know what I think about them some of my
most loved shades and that sort of
things so if you would like to see the
review and swatches on the Kat Von D
shade and light palette please keep on
so this is what the outer packaging
looks like it looks just like her
contour palette the back does list all
of the names of the eyeshadows which
they are all super hard to pronounce but
it lists all the names of the eyeshadows
when you open it up this is what it
looks like I love the big mirror I think
that comes really in handy and then
these are all of our shades a palette is
supposed to be broken down into four
different quads so this quad is supposed
to go together then this one then this
one this is supposed to be more like the
neutral eye and this is the cool tone
and this is the warm tone I believe is
how it is set up but I'll just kind of
go through each quad at a time so it
also says your top color these are
supposed to be all your base colors so
the first base color is this like
yellowish very neutral shade that's what
it looks like on my finger it's like I'm
pretty tan right now cuz I just sat in
the sunshine all weekend in Chicago so
it kind of is blending into my skin but
that's what that shade looks like and
then these three shades right here we
have this really pretty caramel brown
and then a darker shade of brown and
then this one it is kind of like a white
base but it's not stark white and it's
actually one of my favorite shades I
used these two Browns today and then I
actually I used that white shade quite a
bit I really really like it both those
are what those shades look like and
that's what they look like swatched on
my hand I don't think I have a favorite
quad out of this group I'm finding
myself using a lot of them
I really haven't used the base color for
this quad because it's so light I just
haven't really found a reason to be able
to use it yet but yeah so that is the
first quad so then the second one is
more on the cool tone side the base
color for this is this really like pale
gray color and I actually really like it
I
that a lot I used it in today's makeup
tutorial I just I think it's a really
great transition or crease shade hey
shades I absolutely love this first gray
shade I use it a lot I think it's
beautiful then we have a black shade
which is really good and then we have
this is this white shade is more of like
the basic like stark white shade so
those are them swatched on my hand again
I absolutely I love this gray the black
is super black and of course these are
all matte shades so it's a black matte
that you're getting and then a really
beautiful white matte shade so I think
all those colors are super beautiful
used together to create a really pretty
cool tone eye makeup look I think would
be absolutely beautiful so yeah I really
really like that quad so this is like
the warm quad and again I absolutely
love these colors this first base shade
is like a peachy color and it is so
beautiful I used it in today's makeup
look and I just think it's gorgeous
I think it's gorgeous as a transition
color it's gorgeous as an eyelid color
it's kind of blending in with my tan
skin today but I just I think it's such
a beautiful shade this first shade this
it's kind of like a reddish brown I'm
hearing that it's a really close dupe to
Mac's Brown script I don't own Mac's
Brown script so I cannot tell you that
myself but I've heard several other
people comment that they are really
similar to each other and I know Mac
Brown script is a very loved Mac shade
so just want to throw that out there
that I have heard that but I think it's
such a beautiful red shade I find myself
going for it a lot and then we have a
deep brown shade and then almost like
this is another lighter shade and it's
almost kind of like peachy champagne II
it's it's beautiful I love all of the
light shades in here I think they're
gorgeous so there they are on my finger
and here they are swatched on my hand
again absolutely love this quad eye
all the colors are beautiful I I mean I
love all of them I don't know I don't
know how to like pick if I have a
favorite color out of this palette or if
I love one quad more than the other
because I think they are just all so
beautiful there are so many different
looks you can do with this I just I'm so
impressed with this palette I waited a
long time to buy it
I watched so many other review videos
and listened to other people read the
reviews looked at the spa dress that
other people were sharing and decided
you know I am gonna go for it it's 46
dollars so it is a bit of investment but
just knowing I have not repeated a look
yet with this palette and I have used it
probably over 10 times and I have not
repeated the look so there is so much
you can do natural neutral smoky very
dramatic I mean there's just cool tone
warm tones there's so much that you can
do with it so I I just absolutely love
it I find myself using so many of the
shades the only thing that I don't
really love about the palette is how
dusty it gets I put my brush into a
shade and swirl it around it kind of
goes everywhere and I constantly find
myself having to blow off the palette I
do mention this in my favorites video
too if you've seen it that's probably
the worst part of it especially like
when I'm blowing the shadows and that's
going all over my sink then I have to
immediately clean my sink or else it
looks kind of crazy so that's the only
part that I don't love but overall I
think this palette is absolutely
wonderful these are all matte shades so
if you are looking to be able to do
something that is like sparkly or
shimmery you're not going to get one
shade out of here that has Sparkle or
shimmer in it they are all matte they
all blend so easily they work so well
together I love that she gives you ideas
with the different quads the packaging
also does come with I think it's like
nine different eye looks that you can do
and they tell you where to put what
color I just I think it's absolutely
wonderful
again it's 46 dollars at Sephora and I
will link it below are I'm really
enjoying it and I give it a big ol
thumbs up I would
I recommend this product and yeah I just
really really enjoyed it so those are my
reviews on the pallet and if you would
like to see how I got this look using
this palette
please keep okay so first I do want to
mention that I have my face totally
completed and I have my eye primed so
the only thing that I'll be doing is
actually applying the shadows the liner
lashes mascara that sort of thing but
the first shadow that I'm going in with
is this peachy color over here and the
names are are all really bizarre I think
this is called latest lattice but it's
this peachy color and I'm just putting
it on this fluffy blending brush from BH
Cosmetics and it's just going to be like
my transition shade like I mentioned
it's really kind of a dusty palette so
I'm just going to be putting this like
all over in the crease of my eye to
start off with
next I'm gonna be taking this gray color
here it's next to the black
I think it's called Shaq's I'm going to
be taking that one and I'm going to be
putting it on the Sigma blending brush
that e 25 and I'm just going to be
putting that directly into the crease
and kind of blending it out to start to
bring some definition to the look and
this brush is really really good
for the purpose that I'm using it for
right now for just blending and blending
and blending it is a really really good
brush for that I highly recommend that
that you 25 from Sigma and I'm going to
be dragging the color just a little bit
like up here to start to build the
definition of the smoky eye
next I'm gonna take this brown shade
it's the second from the last it is
called solace and I'm going to go in
with this BH Cosmetics brush and it just
has it like comes to a tip and it's kind
of a stiffer brush so not really a
blending brush and I'm just going to
like tap the shade just get a little bit
on it and then I'm going to Pat that
color right near it's gonna be like in
the crease of my eye but towards the top
I'm just gonna Pat it in there and kind
of that's where like the definition of
the smokey part is gonna be it's gonna
be with this brown so I'm just patting
it in there
and then I'm just gonna very lightly use
that same brush and kind of bring it
towards the inner eye but not fully not
all the way I kind of stopped about
halfway and then I'm just gonna go back
and I'm just gonna tap it drag it just a
little bit come back in with a clean
blending brush this again that's my BH
Cosmetics brush and I'm going to blend
that shade in and I'm gonna use like the
windshield wiper motions I'm just gonna
blend it in I'm gonna build it up
because again I want it to be smoked out
so I'm dragging it a little bit past my
eye and up and I'm just going to blend
that shade in so there's no harsh lines
anywhere at all in the eye so this is
the part where I start to like do the
blown out smoky look and I know like my
blown out smoky isn't like SuperDuper
blown out like some other people but
honestly I'm just like really starting
to get into the smoky eye look so this
is kind of like where my comfort level
is right now so if you're new to a smoky
eye or you aren't quite sure yet I feel
like this is a pretty good place to
start I'm not using any blacks you know
what a lot of times when you think of
smoky eye you think of black eyeshadow I
have experimented with the black in this
palette a little bit and I do like it
but black still kind of intimidates me
so that's why we're doing the brown
smokey eye so just using that blending
brush gonna blend it back and forth back
and forth and if you want your look to
be darker you know
see this is your makeup look you can do
whatever it is you want with it but if
you want it to be darker just keep
putting the brown on the brush hiding it
blending it I mean you can do that as
many times as you would like until you
get the desired effect that you are
going for because this is your makeup
look this is just an idea and a guide
that I'm giving the next I'm going to
fill in the rest of my eyelid and so I'm
going to be going in with this second
brown color I have no idea the name
Citra not a clue these names are so
bizarre
and I'm going back in with another BH
Cosmetics brush and it's just kind of
like this flat flat brush regular old
eyeshadow brush will do but I'm gonna
pick up kind of a lot of that color and
then I'm just patting it all over my
eyelid I'm not gonna extend this color
out anywhere pass my eyelid or above my
eyelid what I kind of like using about
these like flat brushes is that I can
get it in the crease but know that I'm
not going above it so just all over my
eyelid with this shade from there I'm
just gonna go back to my Sigma blending
brush the e25 with no product on it it's
a should be a clean brush and I'm just
gonna start to blend all of that
together so there's no harsh lines
anywhere so just blend as often as you
need to until you don't have any harsh
lines and it's all just a beautiful
blended look when I was doing this
makeup look
I thought the brown on my eyelid like
wasn't the really the brown that I
wanted it to be so I came in and just
use this first shade cuz laticious maybe
this is really pretty like caramel shade
and I'm just putting it on a another
flat eyeshadow brush from BH Cosmetics
so just picking up a little bit of that
product and tapping it all over my
eyelid just to give more
the desired Brown effect that I was
going for and then once I have that done
I'm just going back in with my
handy-dandy blending brush from BH
Cosmetics a clean brush and I'm just
doing a final blend so just blending it
all together again making sure that new
brown shade mixes in well with
everything making sure there's no harsh
lines making sure that the desired
smokey and blown out effect that I want
is what I wanted making sure my eyes
match up you know all those fun things
and this is the point in time where you
can look you can add more colors you can
build up your eyelid color more you can
build up the smokey eye portion more I
mean just whatever it is that you want
to do to get it to the look that you
want it this is the time where you do it
and then I just recommend after every
time you add any sort of eye shadow
product just go back in with your
blending brush and blend and blend and
blend and blend so it all looks blended
and fabulous as the end results next I'm
going to be doing my top eyeliner in
wing and I'm using the Maybelline master
graphic eyeliner it is the one with the
tip the one that I've been talking about
recently that I love so much made it in
my favorites video so that's what I'm
going to be doing how I do my winged
eyeliner is I first will create the wing
and so I use the thin tip side and I
just slowly start to drag it out and how
I do it is the line from like my bottom
lash I just kind of follow that line I
don't know if that's the easiest way I
can describe it but that's kind of how I
follow it
I just start here and fill it in connect
it along the way along the top and then
what I do is take the wing that I've
created I go about half way and I drag
it across to meet the rest of my
eyeliner kind of forming that wing
and then I just make sure like the tips
line up so one's not really far and one
it's not like super short so just kind
of from that wing I created I just kind
of make sure the tip looks good are we
even do we look good
hopefully we look okay it's really hard
to put eyeliner around on camera I'm not
gonna lie you guys that was hard to do
okay next I'm going to be doing my like
lower lashline and waterline and I'm
using this NYX there tray jewel a gel
pencil liner and I'm gonna be putting
that in my waterline
and then one of my favorite brushes to
do my lower lashline this is from BH
Cosmetics also but it's this it's flat
and it's stiff and I just think it works
so well for a lower lash line and I'm
going to be going in with this shade
called lucious lucious maybe I'm hearing
that it's pretty much an exact dupe for
Mac's Brown script I don't have Mac's
Brown script but it's a very talked
about I shadow so if it is a dupe then
okay cool but I'm just putting a little
bit on my brush and then smudging it on
my lower lashline and I want to get this
you know pretty close to the lash line
and to finish out the lower lash line
also by BH Cosmetics this is it's bigger
than like a normal pencil brush but it
comes to that pointed edge as well I'm
going in with this brown shade the ones
that I first used all over the eyelid
it's the suitry shade or something along
those lines I'm just dabbing a little
bit on the brush and then sweeping it
under the lower lash line kind of
blending that and the first shade
together and I like this brush when I'm
doing more of like the smokey lower line
look because I think it just does a
really good job at smudging and smoking
the shadows out so now I'm going to move
on to false eyelashes and I wanted to
use a false lashes for this look just
because it's a bit darker and smoky and
I think lashes work well with it but I
wanted to use more of a natural lash so
this is the lash that I'm using and I do
apologize because I've just always had
these lashings around and so I actually
don't know which ones they are I think
they I'm pretty sure they're from ardell
because I pretty much buy only ardell
lashes but it will be doing better I
want to do you know more lashes in my
video so this wasn't made the first time
I'm wearing lashes in a video and I just
wanted to pair lashes with this look so
I thought it would look good but with
the darker eyes I don't always love
really like thick heavy dramatic lashes
I kind of like to save those for more
natural or just slightly more toned down
look so that's why I went with the more
natural of an adhesive
I use this is from do oh and it's a dark
tone adhesive I do recommend adhesive
versus glue I absolutely hate eyelash
glue like I just hate it like using the
darker tone because it dries dark versus
when I use the white sometimes if you
use too much or if you don't want to get
tacky all the way then it just you can
see the white and I don't like it I
think it messes up the eyeliner it just
I always go for the dark tone and I
would get this add just like my local
Walgreens so kind of another tip when
you are putting eyelashes on I put a
very thin strip on your strip of your
eyelash and I mean thin you you don't
need to pack on a do you so that's not
gonna do anything besides probably make
it Messier but then I wait about 30 to
40 seconds to let that heavy sub get
tacky because if you put it on too wet
it's gonna smear it's going to be
everywhere so you want it you want to
let it get tacky before you actually
apply the eyelash I don't know if you
can see like that's how thin of a layer
I put on cuz I just don't think that you
need a lot and then then you can kind of
blow on it don't put a use up on your
eyelash and then immediately stick it on
your eye because you're gonna have my
views of everywhere and it's not gonna
be cute I'm also kind of nervous to put
eyelashes on on camera because that's
gonna be the first time I'm doing this
and I have no idea how it's going to
work out and I'm gonna try to use my
tweezers but usually honestly I just use
my fingers a lot of people swear by
using tweezers or they get excited when
they use their fingers to apply false
lashes that's the easiest way for me but
I'm gonna really try to go the tweezer
route so maybe you can see more of what
I'm doing versus if I just have like my
hands all up in there but we'll see how
it goes
okay so I don't think that was the best
eyelash application I've ever done in my
entire life but it didn't turn out as
bad as I thought it would go okay now
that that's finished I'm just gonna be
going in with my mascara and I'm using
the Lancome Hypnose drama mascara just
when I use lashes I don't feel like I
need to use like one of my more favorite
mascaras because I feel like the lashes
do a lot of the work some people are
really against putting mascara on fake
eyelashes for me I feel like my fake
eyelashes look silly if I don't have
mascara on top of them as well so I
usually use them I think it does make
your eyelashes not last as long but I
still get three to five uses out of
every single lash that I own even when I
put mascara on them so I'm okay with it
so I'm just gonna add those to my top
and bottom lashes
okay so this is the final result I
really hope that you enjoyed not only to
make a tutorial part of this video but I
hope you liked the review on the
swatches of all the different shades and
the breakdown of the palette it's one
that I really love one that I highly
recommend so I had a lot of fun filming
this for you especially as a makeup
tutorial even though my weather isn't
exactly quite working out for me but I
hope you were able to still get the gist
of what it was that I was doing but with
so many different shades and so many
different looks that you can do with
this palette I hope you you know maybe
find some inspiration from the look that
I did but then you know create your own
as well you did enjoy this video please
do give me a thumbs up and let me know
and please subscribe if you have not if
there is any other makeup tutorials that
you would like to see me do please just
comment below and let me know what they
are if you have any other specific
questions about the palette please just
ask away and hopefully I can answer them
or try to find the answers to them
that's all I have to say I'm exhausted I
didn't quite remember how tiring it is
to film a makeup tutorial and I've been
sitting here for almost two hours now so
I'm going to get back to my day I hope
you have a wonderful one thank you so
much for watching and I will see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
