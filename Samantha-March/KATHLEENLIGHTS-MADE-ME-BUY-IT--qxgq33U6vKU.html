today's video is going to be my
kathleenlights made me buy it video so
if you haven't been seeing these
youtuber made me buy it videos floating
around I don't know where we've been
because they have been becoming super
popular lately
I myself have done jaclyn hill made me
buy and then also carli bybel made me
buy it but you guys were saying that you
also wanted to see what kathleenlights
made me buy so i'm finally getting
around to filming that video i'll leave
my other two videos linked down below as
well so this kind of tag video was
started by my friend at kc VL leave her
channel a link to down below she served
it off with kathleenlights made her buy
it and then we have all just been kind
of following suit it's kind of a spin on
the youtube made me buy it
where you talk about the products you
bought because of the youtube hype
except now we're pinpointing some of our
favorite youtubers and going through our
collections and seeing what they
convince us to buy what they talked
about so much maybe what they collabed
on etc so I'm excited to share with you
what kathleenlights made me buy kathleen
is one of my favorite youtubers i think
she is so relatable and down-to-earth
and i think she just hit like 3 million
subscribers on youtube but she is
someone who i still take her opinion in
her reviews very seriously i know
there's so much talk these days of our
the bigger youtubers you know being
honest with us are they you know doing
things and promoting items just because
they're getting paid or working with
brands and but even though she has so
many followers and she does her collabs
I still you know me personally I I think
that she's very relatable I think she's
being honest with us she talks about
what she doesn't like she talks about
what she does like and I just really
respect her opinions I believe in what
she says and I just think that she's a
fantastic youtuber I love her makeup
tutorials stuff that she doesn't feel
the needs of like where the false lashes
every day even though I'm a false lash
girl myself but it's you know you always
say the youtubers that you have to have
the false lash you have to have the wing
you have to do this you have to do that
and she keeps it true to herself and I
just I appreciate that so much in her so
she's definitely one of my favorite
youtubers had to make this video super
long I know all my videos are mostly
longer videos I know that so I tried to
pull the items that like I know
specifically like it was her and she did
it remember the videos I can remember
she was saying like she convinced me to
buy those products so that's everything
that I have pulled for today's video so
if you would like to see what
kathleenlights
made me buy please keep watching so
first up I grabbed out the wet and wild
the mega glow contouring palette and
mine is in dulce de leche and she
started talking about this when it first
started coming out and I was super
curious about it but she had such good
things to say about it that I was like
okay I'm gonna go out and buy it and she
honestly like kind of hyped at this
product up so much that I like went all
across town trying to find it if you
were on my snapchat back in that day you
saw me going everywhere trying to sell
her to find this palette I finally
finally found it
this is actually my second one my first
one I'm not sure what happened I came
home from traveling and when I opened my
makeup bag it was completely shattered
and I was so heartbroken I went right
back out and bought a new one because I
was like I need to have this I just I
cannot be without this I use it so often
I used both sides I like I don't know if
I could pick a favorite side I love the
contour powder I think it's great the
setting powder is like super brightening
I'm wearing the setting powder under my
eyes today I like it as a setting powder
but I also like as a braiding powder at
the contour powder is so good it's so
affordable the pans are so big like oh I
just love this one
I did want to share too that I also
ripped a nail off it hurts so bad if you
were on my snapchat I showed you like
the gruesome up-close photo of it but it
hurts really bad so please don't look at
my nail cuz I don't know what to do I
don't think I can get it fixed because
it actually ripped off my real nail and
it's ripped down so far like it's ripped
below the nail bed it's very painful
I've had a bandaid on it but I take the
band-aid off for the video but I'm like
oh what does one do I don't know I don't
know what I'm gonna do about that but
that happen today I want to talk about
is what I have on my eyes right now this
is the tartlet and bloom palette from
Tarte cosmetics so I have seen Kathleen
talk about this many times before she's
used it in tutorials and I was seeing
her talk about it and you know I saw
other people talk about it and I found
them doing their tutorials and then also
and Kathleen would mention it again I'm
like should I be getting that palette
why am I not getting that palette so I
finally bought it and it's when I bought
it it wasn't like a new palette or
anything like that
but still like people will talk about so
much and she put it in another favorites
video and I was like okay I have to get
it and I'm so so happy that I got it
it's got a big mirror here it's got
these beautiful shades it's a very
neutral palette which is definitely very
Cathleen but it's also very me super
neutral beautiful pinks and browns but
there's also some sparkles in there and
then there are darker shades along the
side here too for you know more of a
dramatic or smoky eye I think it's a
beautiful palette I think it smells
really good
the only drawback of it I would say is
that it definitely does have a lot of
fallout if you use this palette you
definitely need to do your eyes first
before you do your face makeup even if
you're using the lighter shades you're
gonna get a lot of fallout but they're
very very pigmented and very very pretty
so the tartlet and bloom palette I'm
really happy that actually convinced me
to finally buy this one so I have a
couple of color pop eyeshadows in here
color pop really I discovered it through
kathleenlights I feel like she was one
of the very first youtubers that was
constantly talking about color pop and
talking about color pop and I know that
when they did their first collaboration
I think between cats and lights and
color pop I think she said she was at
like 200,000 subscribers or something
like that and I followed
I was following Kathleen right around
that time and I don't know I just it was
kind of like a newer brand to me but
then she was talking about it a lot and
then all of a sudden she was collabing
with them and I was like wait what is
this brand I feel like Kathleen is the
one who kind of push me towards color
pop in general I have quite a bit from
colour-pop to show but I have two
eyeshadows to talk about first
these were shades that were recommended
from her so she would recommend the
shade at Central Perk which is a
beautiful like purpley burgundy type of
shade it is way gorgeous and I love the
name Central Perk friends I just thought
that was so much fun and then the other
shade she still I feel like I just
watched a video a couple weeks ago and
she was still talking about the shade
this is in LA LA and it's one of my
favorite shades it's one of my absolute
favorite shades
it's a beautiful like rose gold metallic
shade it is so pretty so Central Perk
and Lala these shades in particular from
their super shock shadows she convinced
me to buy because I was watching her
videos and making my notes she convinced
me
to get these two and of course I don't
know I haven't seen one kathleenlights
maybe by a video where someone hasn't
talked about this product and of course
I'm talking about the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer Kathleen lights made
everybody go out and buy this bronzer
and I was definitely one of them
it's a gorgeous bronzer I'm wearing it
today it smells heavenly I love the way
it smells you get a lot of product
Physicians Formula is more expensive so
this was actually I believe my very
first Physicians Formula purchase and it
was because it was 75% off at my CVS
otherwise I don't know if I could have
done it but looking back I would
probably repurchase this one maybe if
they even if it was just like a little
bit of a discount like a 25% discount
maybe I would buy it but it's so hard to
pay such a high pricing at the drugstore
like you just feel like you're being
gypped you know what I'm saying this
bronzer is so beautiful everybody loves
it and talks about it for a very good
reason because it's a very very very
good bronzer so kathleenlights she made
the whole world buy this bronzer so next
up this is kind of cheating because I
didn't purchase it myself but a
wonderful subscriber purchased it for me
she heard me talking about this and I
will I buy a video where I was talking
about kathleenlights and her KL polish
the brand that she just put out and I
was saying how I wanted to make a
purchase from them and I hadn't yet and
my wonderful subscribers Danielle
actually sent me a Polish so she sent me
the Kayla polish in a really sweet note
saying that she knew that I really
wanted to get a nail polish so she
picked one up for me she got me the
shade snickerdoodle and I was actually
going to paint my nails today and then
this happened so I don't know yet what
I'm doing about this nail but as soon as
I get my nails fixed then I am painting
in the shade snickerdoodle which looks
to be like just a beautiful nude shade
which it was probably similar to what I
have on and what I wear most days these
type of shades so much and I'm really
excited to try out kale polish and her
brain and see what it's all about
I love nail polish even though I do get
acrylics put on I don't have him paint
him at the salon and I come home and
paint my own nails because I love nail
polish and I have some money so I was
really excited to add snickerdoodle to
my collection everything else when I was
getting ready for this video I was just
throwing things in my cute little mug my
girl boss mug of my friend Wendy who's a
fellow author
Wendie nunnery she sent me this mug and
I just thought it was the cutest thing
and I thought it would make sense for
this video since Kathleen is definitely
a girl boss
so just pulling some items out of here
this is a lipstick from wet-and-wild
it's in the shade bear doll and this was
a long time ago I actually don't know
for sure if I even had my youtube
channel yet I was still just watching
videos and I was watching Kathleen's and
she did a dupes video and I think it was
all lipsticks all lipstick dupes said
that this wet and wild bear at all is a
dupe for Mac's
velvet teddy so before I actually
started my channel when I was just
really getting into watching all these
makeup and beauty videos everybody
talked about Mac it was Mac everything I
remember one of the very first like
high-end purchases I made I looked up
where a Mac store was because I did not
know that answer and I went and bought
like a mac world lip liner and a Mac
pigment and I just thought I was like oh
my gosh if I am gonna be on YouTube I
needed my Mac because they're pretty tux
by Mac and she put in there that this
was a dupe for Mac and I was like I'm
gonna buy it because Mac's expensive and
wet and wild this was like a dollar
ninety-nine at CVS and I was like that's
what I'm gonna do and it's such a
beautiful shade the packaging can get a
little bit crazy and messy because this
just kind of like rolls up and rolls
down sometimes it doesn't roll down all
the way it's little packaging is a
little bit messy but it's a beautiful
shade it's a dollar ninety-nine like you
can't even beat that it's such a
gorgeous lipstick and I still wear it
all the time
so if Barrow doll looks like I do not
own any matte lipsticks actually so I
don't own velvet teddy so I can't tell
you for sure but she said bear at all as
a dupe and I think it's a gorgeous
lipstick I would totally recommend this
then also out of my little jar she was
recommending the NYX a micro brow pencil
for a while and she was using this a lot
to fill in her brows and another thing
that I really like about Kathleen lights
is that she is very like drugstore
oriented like not only colour-pop but
like a lot of wet and wild she's always
wearing wet and wild products and I just
I appreciate that because sometimes
bigger youtubers can definitely start to
do things way out of our price range and
it's like whoa whoa whoa normal people
can't go out and buy all that stuff so I
definitely appreciate that she uses a
lot of drug store items she's got
drugstore favorites videos out there and
I think
are really helpful but she was
recommending the Knicks breakup micro
brow pencil for a while and I had seen
other people using it and then when she
started to recommend it and use it I was
like okay I'll give it a try I actually
don't like this um this pencil is not
for me I feel like you had to really
like press down really hard and like
just kind of like I don't know it just
it took a lot I was really trying to use
it in the nice push over to the benefit
a goof proof pencil and I thought that
was way better so the NYX micro brow
pencil didn't work out for me
unfortunately well a primer that she
recommended is from Make Up For Ever
this is the step one the smoothing
primer I think she actually like in the
favorites video that I was watching I
think it was the smoothing primer also
that she recommended makeup forever came
out with a lot of these different
primers and I'm pretty sure hers was the
smoothing primer too but I'm not
positive but I chose the smoothing
primer because that's what I like for my
primers and I love this little guy and
I've had this for so long and this is
just like a little guy of it I think you
can buy the little guys I don't think
this was even a deluxe sample I think I
just bought the littler size to see how
I liked it and save a little bit of
money and I still feel like I have a lot
left because a little bit goes a very
long way this is a really nice primer
I'm not even a big primer person but
when people ask me about good primers I
say makeup forever cuz they're good
right and then I feel like everything
else in my little girl boss mug is going
to be color pop and like some of her
collapse that she's done on a lot of her
cloths from colour-pop I've been really
happy with them but one thing even
before she did any color pop collapse
that I had fought she was constantly
recommending the gel liners their pencil
gel liners and I went out I think I
bought like four of them right away yeah
four of them I bought four right away
because I was like she was like raving
about him she had a whole video about
not only the gel liners but then also
the pot liners and she said she didn't
like the pot liners and I still ended up
buying one I don't like him either so I
definitely should listen to her there
but she really really raved about the
pencil liners and I think they are
amazing they are so good I'm constantly
recommending them I think they're like
five dollars I have the shades best Oh
which reminds me of Central Perk kind of
like burgundy type of shade I have this
is get paid the writing is
most completely off this is get paid
beautiful rose gold metallic I have a
and my waterline right now it's
absolutely stunning this one is in maybe
which is a beautiful green sometimes
I'll just wear this as like an eyeliner
shade and it just makes the eyes pop so
much and then also cry baby which is a
lavender I wear this a lot in my
waterline and people ask me what the
white is in my waterline it's actually
this it photographs kind of white but
it's definitely like a lilac lavender
beautiful like you cannot beat these
liners I think they are amazing and then
she actually did a collaboration with
them and she came out with her own gel
liner and I was like yes I'm totally
buying it it's called mr. bang and it's
such a beautiful like rich brown shade
it's so gorgeous it's like a warm brown
I would say it's gorgeous I love it I
wear all the time and that one it's such
a good eye liner I love it but then I
have some lippies as well that she did
in collaboration with color pop so I
think the first one that I got is
Lumiere 2 so she came out with some
Lumiere's
with color pop and then she came out
with this Lumiere 2 I think this is an
ultra matte formula it doesn't say it's
completely worn off again because I wear
it so much but there is what Lumiere -
looks like it's such a beautiful shade I
don't have the original Lumiere but when
I saw the Lumiere 2 in the ultra matte I
was like oh I really want to get it
because I really like the ultra mattes
from colour-pop and it's a gorgeous
color and then she came out with a
collab and she actually released I think
it was these three satin lips and then
also the mr. bang I think she released
some at the same time or around the same
time but I bought all three lippies
because I was just so excited about it
so this first one is Alyssa and it's a
beautiful like everyday pink shade it's
so pretty
these are all ultra satin lips so
they're just a little bit more
comfortable than the ultra mattes really
fantastic lippies very long-lasting very
pigmented other one she came out with
was November which is like one of my
favorites it's such a beautiful pink
shade it has almost like a little bit of
a peach vibe to it I love it I think
it's gorgeous almost like a bit of a
darker pink as well so pretty
I recommend that one
the time and then the other one is point
zero which is actually what I have on my
lips right now I think a lot of people
are afraid of point zero or don't like
it as much because it is definitely very
different it's like almost like a brown
gray but I think it is so cool I mean
you definitely have to like shades like
this in order to want to wear point zero
but I like shades like this I think it's
so pretty like this is probably my
favorite from the collection and I feel
like a lot of people would go towards
the pinks but I went towards this one
all the way I love point zero so much so
I always recommend that as well so these
obviously kathleenlights made me buy
their in collaboration with her I think
she did such a fantastic job these last
four lippies for all the collaboration
with color pop that she did those aren't
the only collaboration she's done other
lippies too and she actually just
released three more new ones I think all
of her like Aquarius shade those just
came out also which i think is so cool
but yeah I definitely wanted to pick up
some of these collaborations I love
being able to show my support that way
as well and yeah she's just someone who
like I said in the beginning I just love
watching her videos I like that I still
find her very real relatable personable
and yeah I was really excited to make
this video on what she made me buy I
hope that you guys enjoyed it but after
these lippies that's going to wrap it up
alright so that's gonna be everything
