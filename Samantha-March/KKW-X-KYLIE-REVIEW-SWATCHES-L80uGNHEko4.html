today's video is going to be all about
the new Kylie cosmetics and Kim
kardashian-west lipsticks so Kim
kardashian-west teamed up with her
sister Kylie Jenner and Kylie cosmetics
to come out was for nude lipsticks so I
just got my box and so I'm going to be
training out for the first time on
camera watching them putting them on my
lips and letting you know what I think
about them and then I also of course
with a lot of new releases I like to
pick up an extra one for you guys so I
do have an extra one for a giveaway so
stay tuned until the end and I will
explain how to enter the giveaway I do
need to apologize obviously for my voice
it probably sounds a little bit
different this is the first video that I
am filming since my wisdom tooth
extraction and it was a very horrible
procedure not only was the tooth on a
nerve so they had to remove a lot of
bone as well and the procedure so I am
still pretty swollen half of my tongue
is still numb and then some of my jaw it
just it feels like I'm so packed with
God even though I got so I apologize for
my voice but I was just feeling a lot of
energy today I've been laying around in
bed for the past 4 days and I was
feeling some good energy today and then
I got these in the mail and I thought
let's just go ahead and film it so I
apologize I know it sounds like my voice
is a little bit crazy but bear with me
hopefully we can make this a quick video
is going to share some swatches my
feedback and then get into the giveaway
so why don't we go ahead and get started
ok so first this is what the packaging
looks like of the other box and then you
actually slide it open like this to get
all of before lipsticks the packaging is
very beautiful a Karaman pink shirt to
match it because I thought the packaging
was super super pretty the outer
packaging and then also the lipstick
packaging as well so this was $45 kylie
cosmetic products are only available on
Kylie cosmetics calm right now
I didn't think $45 was a bad price for a
set of 4 lipsticks especially because
they were all nude
they would have been kind of more out
there colors or even you know one nude
and three really different colors I
don't think I would have gone for it but
because I love news so much I really
wanted to get it and I didn't think the
price was bad
I have not bought from Cuddy cosmetics
in a very long time because I don't
always hear the greatest things and my
experience wasn't super great to place
my order of the day that it came onto
which was Tuesday by the following
Tuesday I still hadn't even gotten a
shipping confirmation and I was seeing
other people had I emailed Kylie
cosmetics on Wednesday I got like a
general email saying like oh sorry your
package will ship soon whatever but then
it actually did ship and I got him in by
the following Saturday but I know people
still who ordered on Tuesday still
haven't gotten theirs and then they did
a restock that following Friday which
made no sense to me if everybody's
original order was from Tuesday still
haven't been shipped out why are you
doing a reset I can does bad business I
did not like that at all I have not
touched it yet I have no idea what these
like are on my list
I might absolutely love these but
because of that I again I don't want to
order from Kylie cosmetics it's been
about a year since I have anyways and it
was because I would hear not-so-great
feedback from others so I waited I
waited I didn't do it then this caught
my eye and I thought okay you know I'll
go ahead and do it and then I was
disappointed already I was like you know
what okay well it wasn't learned and I'm
probably not going to do it again for a
very long time because it just made me
really really upset it kind of my
experience with my order or so again
customer service is still for Kelly
cosmetics so this is a new formula to
Kylie cosmetics the creme with what
lipstick so it doesn't dry completely
matte it doesn't dry completely down
it's supposed to be compared to almost
like a lip gloss but not sticky have a
really buttery feel to the lips just
feel a little bit better than you know
look at your wine matte liquid lipstick
but not be like a lip gloss it's like
somewhere in between so I'm curious to
see what I think of the formula and then
the four different shades we have Kiki
which is a pinky nude Kim a peachy nude
Kimmy a deep nude and Kimberly
Tribune so there's that so I'm just
going to go ahead and get started and
get some of these on my lips and see
what I think so this first one is
Kimberly which is described as a true
nude so there is what the swatch of that
one looks like and then here is what the
applicator looks like pretty standard
right there so let me go ahead and get
this on my lips here is Kimberly on my
lips definitely very very nude
I like nudes so I do like this color on
me the application I don't totally love
it definitely does feel more like a lip
gloss but like I don't know it's kind of
like really patchy and this is only one
application
maybe if I built it up it would be a
little bit better but I do like the
color on me but the actual application I
don't feel like I love like it's kind of
streaky and just a bit patchy so mmm I
don't know about that the color I do
lifestyle so this one is Kimberly so the
next one we're going to try out is cama
which is described as a peachy nude so
there is the source of cama definitely
more peachy vibe to this one
so this one is Kim definitely peachy er
a little bit brighter again I like the
color but I'm going to zoom you in so
you can see what it looks like on the
inner part of my lips can you guys see
look how strange it is there I don't
know
that wouldn't make me feel very
comfortable so I don't know if you can
see from that it's just like super like
patchy right on the inner lips I'm just
doing something very bizarre there so I
don't know application why is formula
wise not totally lovin it yet but I do
like the color so far so again this end
is Kim wait on the next one we have is
Kiki which is described as a pinky news
right so this last one here is Kiki I
mean so far you can even tell from my
hand swatches that they are all very
different a lot of people have been
saying you know all those are basically
the same color although they are all
nudes but I'm a mutant ologist from
these swatches they are different so let
me try Kiki on my lips one here is Kiki
what I did with this one is I did two
applications of it and I do think it's
better if you do too
it doesn't come off quite as likes
Apache or streaky so that's what I found
the first two I only did one application
and then I decided for the next two I
would trade two applications and see if
that made a difference and I think it
definitely does so I think it does look
a lot better if you do two applications
it kind of brings out the color a little
bit more but it definitely just looks
better on the lips again I love this
color a little bit more excited about
building it up twice I feel like it just
makes it look a lot better so if you
have these I would definitely recommend
that so this one is Kiki okay the last
one that we have is cami which is
described as a deep mutant I saw that
last one there is Kimi and here's just a
look at all of the different swatches on
my hand
so this one is Kimmy again I built it up
to two times and I think it looks much
better I really like this color so okay
so I'm glad that I was able to try to
build up the two times I thought that
made a huge huge difference because with
the first two I was like this is not
looking good
so it just build up a couple times two
times maybe even more and I think that
you'll actually like the application so
I'm very relieved about that of course
this is more of a first impressions
video but I haven't been able to wear
these all day to let you guys know what
I think I know they don't write down
that and dive label kind of fades and
they will transfer but they are supposed
to be easy to build up I would agree
with that even from you know just
building up during the application I
feel like it was really easy to do so
those were the swatches of all four of
the lipsticks so what are my first
thoughts on the Kylie cosmetics and Kim
kardashian-west creme lipsticks my first
impression is that I actually do like
them I liked all the shades I don't know
if I could pick a favorite shade I think
maybe the first two Kimberly in Kim may
we were my favorites but I feel like I
have to play around and try to choose a
favorite color but I love moods so I
figured that I was going to really enjoy
the colors for the application it was
easy to apply was easy to build up once
you do layer it on a couple times it
does let go above lips if you just put
the one application on I thought was
very streaky and patchy and I wasn't a
fan of that but once you blow the
episode was much better so first
impressions is pretty good so far the
colors all worked really well for me and
once I figured out the application I
thought it looked good I still I love
the packaging I think like the frosted
lipsticks are super cute so I'm very
happy about that
I don't know if these are going to come
back because they already did a reset so
I truly have no idea I haven't heard
anything right now
if they will come back or not but if
they do if you are true news / fan a Kim
kardashian-west and a color dinner fans
I would definitely say that I would
recommend these if you guys do not
really like new lipsticks if you are
more of the matte dry liquid lipsticks I
do not recommend these because I was
definitely not what this formula is
going to be like that's kind of my first
impression and swatches and we're going
