channel so today's video is going to be
all about Kylie cosmetics so I did pick
up all three of the lip glosses the lip
glosses are a newer part of the Kylie
cosmetics line so I did pick up all
three glasses I will be doing review
with some swatches and putting them on
my lips for you guys to see and giving
my feedback I also did pick up one of
the liquid lipsticks this is in candy
kay I knew I wanted to get my glass my
glasses the glasses just to be able to
come on here and do a review because I
was very curious about them not that I
wasn't curious about the liquid
lipsticks and I was but I will get into
that later I wanted to grab at least one
to be able to say that I tried it I
honestly was more curious about the
glosses because I don't have many
glasses I think I only own two lip
glosses and I very rarely wear them
because they are so darn sticky that it
drives me insane so you know I have a
ton of liquid lipsticks but I don't have
a lot of glosses and so that's why I was
attracted to the glosses I wanted to
pick them up give them a try let you
guys know what I think about them and so
that is exactly what this video is going
to be so I hope you guys will find this
helpful you know of course this is my
honest opinion obviously this video is
not sponsored by Kylie I'm not friends
with Kylie I did not get to go to her
house like some of the other girls and
have a party with their you know these
are just my honest opinions and that's
what I want to give to guys that's the
reason why I bought them was so that I
could review them for you let you guys
know if I think you should buy them or
not if I think they are worth it or not
and all that good stuff so I really hope
you will enjoy my review and swatches
and demos all that good stuff so if you
would like to see the swatches that
reduce my feedback etc on the Kylie
cosmetics lip glosses like I mentioned I
did pick up one of the liquid lipsticks
this is in Kandy K I will be doing a
swatch a little bit later on the video I
don't put it on my lips because this
video is mostly focused on the glasses I
honestly have not even put this on my
lips yet I've only swatched it on my
hand I loved the color it
right here it has dried now so that is
the swatch of candy K of the lipstick
and the lip liner the lip liner I found
to be very creamy the candy cake color I
found to be good but I have not put it
on my lips yet so I can't do a review
for this video in here I'll probably do
that on Instagram later in time after I
tried it but again this video is mostly
focused on the glasses I did just want
to pick one up to give it a try myself
but to get into the glasses so this is
what the packaging looks like there are
three different shades like literally
and so cute like is the darkest shade
literally is in the middle and so cute
is the latest one keep watching I will
be doing swatches and live swatches on
my lips as well of each of the three
glosses so I will say that I did get the
second batch of glosses the first time
the glosses went out once they were
launched on the Kylie cosmetics website
I actually did want to get them because
I don't have many glasses like I
mentioned did want to get the glasses I
just wasn't around my computer if you
are not on the Kylie cosmetics website
as a launch is happening you're not
going to get the products because I
think maybe the longest has ever taken
them to sell out was like 10 or 15
minutes usually they're sold out in just
a couple of minutes but they do restock
very regularly which i think is pretty
awesome I know the Kylie cosmetics on
Instagram like usually gives like the
updates of exactly what time the launch
will be happening so that's really
helpful that's what I looked at when I
figured out that I wanted these I went
to the Kylie cosmetics Instagram saw the
next date and time they were going to be
restocked and then was on my computer
five minutes ahead of time waiting to
get the glasses and that's just that's
just how you have to do it you can't
just go to your computer at any point
and see if anything's in stock that's
that's just not going to happen
so I am glad that I waited for the
second round of glosses to come out
because I guess there was a pretty big
problem with the first glasses that came
out and that was that the applicator for
the glasses was so long that it was
fraying like even before use or after a
one time use the wands were completely
fraying I watched
people snapshots of it I saw instagrams
of it and it looked really shoddy and so
then I was like you know what never mind
I don't want those glasses because
people can't use them and now you just
wasted all this money then kindly came
on saying that she realized that issue
and they actually remade the blondes and
they made him into the shorter
applicators and she said the next time
it that you order you know like going
forward they're only gonna have the
shorter ones and I was like okay then
I'll try them out I was also like wow
that really stings for everybody who
ordered the first round of glasses that
you now have this defective glass you
can't use it you just wasted your money
I also saw that Kylie just came out and
said everybody who ordered from those
first glasses are automatically being
sent new glasses for free there isn't
anything that you have to do to get them
they're just going through that order
and shipping out new glasses to
everybody who ordered that I think is
cool that is just happening I haven't
seen anyone get the glasses yes so I
mean I can't say anything on that or
whatever how long they take to get I
don't know I haven't seen anyone get
them yet but this was just like two days
ago that I saw her say that on her
social media so that's cool that's great
that she's actually you know standing up
her product sitting behind her product
obviously you need to listen to your
fans because if people are gonna start
thinking that they're getting defective
materials from your line you know why
would we want to keep buying it so
that's cool so just so you know if you
did order the first round and you
haven't seen anything yet you're
supposed to be getting something coming
I don't know you guys can let me know if
you guys are getting things in but I
haven't seen anything yet glosses are
something that I can't say that I've
ever very that I can't say I've really
ever been very into mostly because all
the glosses that I have bought have been
so sticky on my lips that one even I
would like talked it would feel like
your lips were sticking together are
your hair what a constant gets stuck in
your lipgloss and it just was like a
mess I don't want anything to do with
lip glosses and then of course the
liquid lipsticks came out and then that
craze was happening and I'm still about
that crazy because I absolutely love
liquid
six so that's why I have been leery of
glasses but like I said obviously I
wanted to give these a try I want to
review them I know there was a lot of
questions but when people are wondering
whether or not to buy them so the
glasses are $15 but after trying them so
I just watched them first like on my
hands and then the following day I
applied each of them to my lips and
tried them out and I have to say my
first impressions face on that or
actually very very good they are not
sticky at all like I can rub my lips
together no problem they're not gonna
stick together and that was the biggest
thing that I was like thank goodness
that gloss is not like that because I
would not have wanted to warn any of
these shades had they been glossy or
have they been sticky they are glossy
they are not sticky which I find
absolutely fantastic so I will say that
I do think they have a very very strong
scent if you do not like strong scents
and your products you probably are not
gonna like these they smell like they
have like a cupcake smell but even like
just when you open it like not even
applying it like if I open it like this
I can smell it and it is very strong and
very fragrant I will say that I think
the scent lasts on your lips for about
an hour and then I don't know if I just
got used to it or if the Sun went away I
don't know but it was probably after
about an hour that I felt like I
couldn't smell it anymore so that was
good I also thought the lasting power it
really did impress me I mean the day
that I wore them I wasn't doing anything
like strenuous are crazy but I did you
know I took my dog for a walk I was
working you know things like that I
didn't eat while I had it on so I can't
attest to how it how it holds up all
your eating my guess is not good because
like I said it's lip gloss but the
actual like color of it and the
glossiness of it at lesson on me for
about six hours and then it was about
time and I took all of my makeup off so
I was really impressed with that
especially just how much is the color
the pigmentation stays on your lips I
thought that lasts it very very well on
me I do think that they are super glossy
and if you like the glossy look I think
you would really like the
because they are extremely glossy and it
was it was kind of funny as my husband
came home and he's like your whoops look
and I just had to laugh because he's
probably so used to seeing me in regular
lipsticks or liquid lipsticks that when
he came home and I had full brown gloss
on my lips he was like what are you what
are you doing what's this about so that
was kind of funny and I also went up on
my snapchat and I was showing these
swatches a lot of people wrote back and
said they make your lips look bigger
which i think is the gloss because in
this video and in my swatches I have not
used any lip liners with them I will in
the future but I wanted to show you guys
what they look like with no liners you
know just the lip glosses by themselves
and so I don't have a lip liner on I
didn't like over line or anything with a
gloss cuz I feel like that would be
weird but I think it's like the glossy
effect that makes your lips look bigger
so if you're someone who wants to make
your lips look bigger I would say hey
maybe give gloss a try I don't think I
ever really realized that until I tried
the lip glosses and I still don't think
I realized it until more and more people
in my snap or saying you go lips look
bigger your lips look bigger but I
started really looking at them and I was
like I think maybe it's the glass part
that's doing that so I thought that was
pretty good so those are just some of my
initial thoughts again I haven't had the
products for too long but this is not
gonna be the second time that I'm
wearing them and everything that I
thought from my first impression I did
share that on Instagram my first my full
first impression review is on Instagram
everything what I said still does hold
true from the second round of time that
I am trying them on overall I am very
impressed with them I feel almost kind
of like worried to say that because I
feel like if I say oh I like them people
are people like get mad because they're
like oh do you see someone so and so on
so they didn't like them or if I say
like I feel like it's the same way
though if I would say like oh you know I
don't like them I think they're amiss
for me people would be like but so and
so and so and so really like them how do
you like them but again this is just my
honest opinion this is my honest
feedback this is what I'm seeing from
the glosses and so far I really like
them I like the different colors I think
they are very you know
on trend and they are also very Kylie
the Browns the nudes and those are some
of my favorite shades to wear it as well
so that's why I kind of gravitated
towards these anyways I like trying
something new I like a glossy look I I
don't know if I will wear them as much
as I will wear a liquid lipstick just
because I don't love like what lipsticks
so much but I definitely see myself
wearing these glasses frequently okay
this has been like the third time if my
camera has overheated well I'm trying to
film this and it's driving me crazy I
feel like I cannot remember what I was
saying before it coming off and I never
know where exactly it's cut me off at so
so frustrating I just want to get
through this so I don't I truly have no
idea where it was that I left off at but
I am impressed with these main reason
being I have yet to find all the glass
that is not sticky on me so that is why
I am very impressed with these that is
why I would recommend them not only do I
like the colors the pigmentations the
lasting abilities of them but because
they are not sticky I just I truly
appreciate that in their lip gloss and I
feel like at least for me it has been
very hard to find you know they are a
little on the pricey side obviously
they're hard to get do I think these are
like a must-have must need if you are a
lipgloss fan like if lip gloss is your
jam and that's what you love I think you
would really really like these and I
would say definitely try to pay
attention see when the latches are see
about getting the glasses I think you
would really like them if you're not
really a lipgloss fan which some people
simply aren't if you're not a lipgloss
fan you don't feel the need that you
have to get these like I wouldn't feel
that need but if you're kind of like in
the middle on the fence like you like
will you like a lip gloss you don't hate
it you don't love it you're like kind of
in the middle I mean I would say
obviously do you I would say maybe pick
up one or two I would say probably one
pick up one try it out see if you like
it if you absolutely fall in love with
it you know get more the next time the
next launch comes back around the only
reason that I bought all three is so
that I could do them for YouTube so I
could review them for you guys and let
you see the swatches because before I
bought them I was watching other
people's swatches and seeing what other
people had to say
this is how I decide to make my
purchases as well as by seeing what
everyone else in the Butte in the beauty
community has to say about them so
that's the reason why I bought three or
my skin tone I would recommend it
literally it's the middle shade it is
the middle shade right here this one was
my favorite I can see myself wearing
this so much again so cute was just a
little bit too light on my skin I think
it will be really good maybe over a lip
gloss or when I have a bit of a tan
going on one of these days like I
thought was a little bit too dark on my
lips but it's funny because also when I
was sharing swatches and posting a lot
of people said that they liked like on
me and I was like really but it's so
dark like it's such a dark brown on me
again maybe when I have a better tan
it'll look better when it comes together
but those are the three shades I'm
impressed with them so cute was the only
one that I found to be a little bit
streaky other than that I thought the
application was very easy lasted a long
time on me my biggest thing they're not
sticky again remember they do have that
intense smell to them so if you don't
like things with intense smells you are
not gonna like these at all but yeah
other than that that is my review if you
guys have any specific questions if
there's anything that I missed or I
didn't answer please just leave them in
the comments below I will be happy to
share whatever it is that you guys are
wondering about or answer any sort of
questions that you guys might have on
the glasses I'll be so so happy to do
that so just leave those in the comments
below if you have other questions but
other than that that is my review guys
so let's jump in to the swatches and so
first I'll do the candy kay just to get
it out of the way but I do want to show
you guys a swatch of this so this is
what the packaging looks like for the
liquid lipstick and then when you open
it up you have both your liquid lipstick
and also the lip liner and so the scan
DK and
is a really pretty like to me everyday
pink shade and go ahead and swatch it
not worn candy k yet at all but just
even applying it to my hand like feels
really really nice and the lip liner
seems very very creamy which I like that
so these are the swatches of candy kay
the liquid lipstick and the lip liner
again candy cane will dry matte I
obviously just put this on so let me see
the lip liner it looks like you will
need to sharpen it this is what the lip
liner looks like so you would need to
sharpen the lip liner it's not just like
it's not gonna sharpen itself to thank
you're pretty I like the packaging on
each these do remind me of the NYX
lingerie glosses like the packaging
discs but very pretty
did swatch candy kay the other day and
when I did dry to matte on my hand it
looked very gorgeous and this seems to
be like one of the most sought-after
colors I'm seeing a lot of people wear
it and just say how much they love it
and so I was kind of surprised that I
actually was able to get it in the order
but very very happy that I did so let's
move on to the swatches of the glosses I
can come back and then show you a swatch
when this is completely dried down to
matte as well so for the glosses the
packaging see if I can get it all
uniformed this is what the packaging
looks like so a little bit smaller it
just comes with the gloss there's no lip
liner or anything that comes with the
glosses and so I will swatch from
lightest to darkest so the lightest one
is so cute so very very similar
packaging same style packaging as the
liquid lipstick mentioned mine does have
the shorter applicator so that is what
my applicator looks like right there but
to swatch it on my hand
so that one is so cute again this one is
the lightest of the three shades and I
will go ahead and apply to my lips as
well so you can see it on my lips
right so on my lips right now is so cute
I still have the swatch on my hand so
cute
definitely the lightest one like I said
this is the only one that when I did
apply them the other day that I found
any sort of streakiness with it so if
you can see in the demo as I'm putting
that on my lips I did find it to be a
little bit streaky if you just be
generous with the amount of product that
you're putting on I found that that did
help you know allocate the streakiness
that went away after that I do like this
color i special I think it will be
especially good as a topper I kind of
think it is a little bit like too light
on me but maybe if I had a tan it would
look a little nicer but sometimes with
my pale skin and like a very pale glossa
might not be the best combination but
for the summertime I thought this would
be really pretty so again this one is so
cute alright the next one that we have
is literally and this is the middle
color this one was personally my
favorite color I just thought it looked
the best on me so this one is the middle
shade
so that one is literally you can see
just a bit darker a bit more Brown than
so cute and now to put it on my lips
right so this one on my lips is
literally like I said it's probably my
favorite one you'll see the next one is
a little bit darker and I think too dark
for me right now but I thought this one
was just like my perfect shade
definitely my favorite definitely can
see myself wearing literally quite a bit
and then the last shade is the darkest
shade and this is a like
so there is like you can see it is
definitely the darkest and it has I mean
just like the other three it really does
have good pigmentation so yeah
here are the three glasses now I will go
ahead and add like to my lips
so this is the darkest shade this is in
like so honestly I thought it again as I
was putting it on now but even when I
was putting it on the other day for the
first time when I put that first like
swatch onto my lips it truly felt like I
was putting on a lipstick because the
pigmentation is just so there it's
really crazy how awesomely pigmented
these are it's not just like a basic lip
gloss it definitely has color to them
and I really enjoy it so this one like I
said it's the darkest shade definitely
has the most color to it definitely is
the darkest Brown out of the three but I
like it I like like
I guess and so that is all three of the
shades on my hand and then also on my
lips I really hope that you enjoyed
these swatches it was fun to do and
we'll say it actually wasn't super easy
removing the glasses to be able to put
on the next glass obviously it wasn't
anything like a liquid lipstick but it
still was hard to get it off and then
making sure that there was no other
pigmentation on my lips so far I put the
next one on so it didn't like alter the
color in any ways so again the lasting
power on these pretty darn good alright
guys and that is everything for this
video I really hope that you enjoyed my
review and the swatches and live
swatches of the Kylie cosmetic lip
glosses again if you guys have any other
