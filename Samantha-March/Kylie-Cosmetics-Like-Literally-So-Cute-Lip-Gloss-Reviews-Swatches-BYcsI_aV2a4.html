channel so today's video is going to be
all about le cosmetics so I did pick up
all three of the lip glosses the lip
glosses are a newer part of the color
cosmetics line so I did pick up all
three glasses I will be doing reviews
swatches and putting them on my lips for
you guys to see and giving my feedback I
also did pick up one of the liquid
lipsticks this is in candy k I knew I
wanted to get my glasses my glasses the
glasses just to be able to come on here
and do a review because I was very
curious about them not that I wasn't
curious about the liquid lipsticks and I
was but I we'll get into that later I
wanted to grab at least one to be able
to say that I tried it I honestly was
more curious about the glasses because I
don't have many glasses i think i only
own two lip glosses and I very rarely
wear them because they are so darn a
sticky that it drives me insane so you
know I have a ton of liquid lipsticks
but I don't have a lot of glasses and so
that's why I was attracted to the
glasses I wanted to pick them up give
them a try let you guys know what I
think about them and so that is exactly
what this video is going to be so I hope
you guys will find this helpful you know
of course this is my honest opinion
obviously this video is not sponsored by
Kylie not friends with Kylie I did not
get to go to her house like some of the
other girls and have a party with her
you know these are just my honest
opinions and that's what I want to give
two guys that's the reason why I bought
them was so that I could review them for
you let you guys know if I think you
should buy them or not if I think they
are worth it or not and all that good
stuff so I really hope you will enjoy my
review and swatches and demos all that
good stuff so if you would like to see
the swatches that reduce my feedback etc
on the Kylie cosmetics lip glosses like
i mentioned i did pick up one of the
liquid lipsticks this is in candy ki
will be doing a swatch a little bit
later on the video i don't put it on my
lips because this video is mostly
focused on the glasses I honestly have
not even put this on my lip to you I've
only swatched it on my hand I loved the
color it is right here it is dry
now so that is the swatch of candy k the
lipstick and the lip liner the lip liner
I found to be very creamy the candy cake
color I found to be good but I have not
put it on my lips yet so I can't do a
review for this video in here I'll
probably do that on Instagram later in
time after I tried it but again this
video is mostly focused on the glasses i
did just want to pick one up to give it
a try myself but to get into the glasses
so this is what the packaging looks like
there are three different shades like
literally and so cute like is the
darkest shade literally is in the middle
and so cute is the latest one keep
watching i will be doing swatches and
live swatches on my lips as well of each
of the three glasses so i will say that
i did get the second batch of glasses
the first time the glasses went out once
they were launched on the cali cosmetics
website i actually did want to get them
because i don't have many glasses like i
mentioned did want to get the glasses i
just wasn't around my computer if you
are not on the kylie cosmetics website
as a launch is happening you're not
going to get the products because i
think maybe the longest has ever taken
them to sell out was like 10 or 15
minutes usually they're sold out in just
a couple of minutes but they do restock
very regularly which i think is pretty
awesome I know the Kylie cosmetics on
Instagram like usually gives like the
updates of exactly what time the launch
will be happening so that's really
helpful that's what I looked at when I
figured out that I wanted these i went
to the kelly cosmetics instagram saw the
next date and time they were going to be
restocked and then was on my computer
five minutes ahead of time waiting to
get the glasses and that's just that's
just how you have to do it you can't
just go to your computer at any point
and see if anything since stock that's
that's just not going to happen so i am
glad that I waited for the second round
of glasses to come out because I guess
there was a pretty big problem what the
first glasses that came out and that was
that the applicator for the glasses was
so long that it was fraying like even
before you or after a one time use the
wands were completely fraying I watched
people snapchat
I saw instagrams of it and it looked
really shoddy and so then I was like you
know what nevermind I don't want those
glasses because people can't use them
and now you just wasted all this money
then kindly came on saying that she
realized that issue and they actually
remade the wands and they made him into
the shorter applicators and she said the
next time it that you order you know
like going forward they're only going to
have the shorter ones and I was like
okay then I'll try them out I was also
like wow that really stings for
everybody who ordered the first round of
glasses that you now have this defective
glass you can't use it you just wasted
your money I also saw that Kylie just
came out and said everybody who ordered
from those first glasses are
automatically being sent new glasses for
free there isn't anything that you have
to do to get them they're just going
through that order and shipping out new
glasses to everybody who ordered that I
think is cool that is just happening I
haven't seen anyone get the glasses yes
so I mean I can't say anything on that
or whatever how long they take to get I
don't know I haven't seen anyone get
them yet but this was just like two days
ago that I saw her say that on her
social media so that's cool that's great
that she's actually leaning out standing
up for product sitting behind her
product obviously you need to listen to
your fans because if people are gonna
start thinking that they're getting
defective materials from your line you
know why would we want to keep buying it
so that's cool so just so you know if
you did order the first round and you
haven't seen anything yet you're
supposed to be getting something coming
I don't know you guys can let me know if
you guys are getting things in but I
haven't seen anything yet glosses are
some things that I can't say that I've
ever very that I can't say I've really
ever been very into mostly because all
the glasses that I have bought have been
so sticky on my lips that one even I
would like talk it would feel like your
lips are sticking together are your hair
what a constant gets stuck in your lip
gloss and it just was like a mess I
don't want anything to do with lip
glosses and then of course the liquid
lipsticks came out and then that Crais
was happening and I'm still about that
crazy because I absolutely love liquid
lipsticks so that's why I have
been leery of glasses but like I said
obviously I wanted to give these a try I
wanted to review um I know there was a
lot of questions bottom people are
wondering whether or not to buy them so
the glasses are fifteen dollars but
after trying them so I just watched them
first like on my hands and then the
following day I applied each of them to
my lips and tried them out and I have to
say my first impressions face on that or
actually very very good they are not
sticky at all like I can rub my lips
together no problem they're not going to
stick together and that was the biggest
thing that I was like thank goodness
that gloss is not like that because I
would not have wanted to warn any of
these shades had they been glossy or
have they been sticky they are glossy
they are not sticky which I find
absolutely fantastic so I will say that
I do think they have a very very strong
scent if you do not like strong sense in
your products you probably are not going
to like these they smell like a have
like a cupcake smell but even like just
when you open it like not even applying
it like if I open it like this I can
smell it and it is very strong and very
fragrant i will say that i think the
scent lasts on your lips for about an
hour and then I don't know if I just got
used to it or the Sun one way I don't
know but it was probably after about an
hour that I felt like I couldn't smell
it anymore so that was good I also
thought the lasting power it really did
impress me I mean the day that I wore
them I wasn't doing anything like
strenuous are crazy but I did you know I
took my dog for a walk i was working you
know things like that i didn't eat while
i had it on so i can't attest to how how
it holds up all your eating my guess is
not good because like i said its lip
gloss but the actual light color of it
and the glossiness of it at lesson on me
for about six hours and then it was
about time and i took all my makeup off
so i was really impressed with that
especially just how much is the color
the pigmentation stays on your lips I
thought that lasts it very very well on
me I do think that they are super glossy
and if you like the glossy look I think
you would really like these because they
are extremely glossy
he knows it was kind of funny as my
husband came home when he's like you're
whoops look what and I just had to laugh
because he's probably so used to seeing
me in regular lip sticks or liquid
lipsticks that when he came home and I
had full brown gloss on my lips he was
like what are you what are you doing
what's this about so that was kind of
funny and I also went on my snapchat and
I was showing these swatches a lot of
people wrote back and said they make
your lips look bigger which i think is
the gloss because in this video and in
my swatches I have not used any lip
liners with them I will in the future
but I wanted to show you guys what they
look like with no liners you know just
the lip glosses by themselves and so I
don't have a lip liner on I didn't like
over line or anything with a gloss cuz I
feel like that would be weird but i
think it's like the glossy effect that
makes your lips look bigger so if you're
someone who wants to make your lips look
bigger i would say hey maybe give gloss
a try I don't think I ever really
realized that until I tried the lip
glosses and I still don't think I
realized it until more and more people
in my snap or saying your lips look
bigger your lips look bigger that I
started really looking at them and I was
like I think maybe it's the glass part
that's doing that so I thought that was
pretty good so those are just some of my
initial thoughts again I haven't had the
products for too long but this is not
going to be the second time that I'm
wearing them and everything that I
thought from my first impression I did
share that on Instagram my first my full
first impression review is on Instagram
everything what I said still does hold
true from the second round of time that
I am trying them on overall I am very
impressed with them I feel almost kind
of like worried to say that because i
feel like if i say oh i like them people
are people like get mad because they're
like oh do you see someone so and so on
so they didn't like them or if I say I
like I feel like it's the same way
though if I would say like oh you know I
don't like them I think they were miss
for me people would be like but
so-and-so and so-and-so really like them
how do you like them but again this is
just my honest opinion this is my honest
feedback this is what I'm seeing from
the glasses and so far I really like
them I like the different colors I think
they are very you know on trend and
there
also very Kylie the Browns the nudes and
those are some of my favorite shades to
wear it as well so that's why I kind of
gravitated towards these anyways I like
trying something new I like a glossy
look I i don't know if i will wear them
as much as I will wear a liquid lipstick
just because I love like what lipstick
so much but I definitely see myself
wearing these glasses frequently okay
this has been like the third time at my
camera has over he did well I'm trying
to film us and it's driving me crazy I
feel like I cannot remember what I was
saying before it coming off and I never
know where exactly it's cut me off at so
so frustrating I just want to get
through this um so I don't I truly have
no idea where it was that I left off at
but I am impressed with these main
reason being i have yet to find out the
glass that is not sticky on me so that
is why i am very impressed with these
that is why i would recommend them not
only do I like the colors the
pigmentations the lasting abilities of
them but because they are not sticky i
just i truly appreciate that in the lip
gloss and I feel like at least for me it
has been very hard to find you know they
are a little on the pricey side
obviously they're hard to get do I think
these are like a must-have must need if
you are a lip gloss band like if lip
gloss is your jam and that's what you
love I think you would really really
like these and I would say definitely
try to pay attention see when the
latches are see about getting the
glasses I think you would really like
them if you're not really a lip gloss
band which some people simply aren't if
you're not a lip gloss fan you don't
feel the need that you have to get these
like I wouldn't feel that need but if
you're kind of like in the middle on the
fence like you like you like a lip gloss
you don't hate it you don't love it
you're like kind of in the middle I mean
I would say obviously do you I would say
maybe pick up one or two i would say
probably one pick up one try it out see
if you like it if you absolutely fall in
love with it you know get more the next
time the next launch comes back around
the only reason that i bought all three
is so that i could do them for youtube
so I Korean for you guys and let you see
the swatches because before i bought
them I was watching other people's watch
isn't seeing what other people had to
say
this is how I decided to make my
purchases as well as by seeing what
everyone else in the butte in the beauty
community has to say about them so
that's the reason why I bought three for
my skin tone I would recommend literally
it's the middle shade it is the middle
shade right here this one was my
favorite I can see myself wearing this
so much again so cute was just a little
bit too light on my skin I think it will
be really good maybe over a lip gloss or
when I have a bit of a tan going on one
of these days like I thought was a
little bit too dark on my lips but it's
funny because also when I was sharing
swatches and posting a lot of people
said that they liked like on me and I
was like really what's so dark like it's
such a dark brown on me again maybe when
i have a better tan it'll all look
better when it comes together but those
are the three shades I'm impressed with
them so cute was the only one that I
found to be a little bit streaky other
than that I thought the application was
very easy lasted a long time on me my
biggest thing they're not sticky again
remember they do have that intense smell
to them so if you don't like things with
intense smells you are not going to like
these at all but yeah other than that
that is my review if you guys have any
specific questions if there's anything
that i missed or I didn't answer please
just leave them in the comments below I
will be happy to share whatever it is
that you guys are wondering about or
answer any sort of questions that you
guys might have on the glasses I'll be
so so happy to do that so just leave
those in the comments below if you have
other questions but other than that that
is my review I'm in practice so let's
jump in to the swatches and so first
I'll do the candy k just to get it out
of the way but I do want to show you
guys to swatch with this so this is what
the packaging looks like for the liquid
lipstick and then when you open it up
you have both your liquid lipstick and
also the lip liner and so the scan DK
and
it is a really pretty like to me
everyday pink shade and go ahead and
swatch it not worn can DK yet at all but
just even applying it to my hand like
feels really really nice and the lip
liner seems very very creamy which I
like that so these are the swatches of
candy k the liquid lipstick and the lip
liner again candy Kate will dry matte I
obviously just put this on so let me see
the lip liner it looks like you will
need to sharpen it this is what the lip
liner looks like so you would need to
sharpen the lip liner it's not just like
it's not going to sharpen itself tip
thing you're pretty I like the packaging
on each these do remind me of the Knicks
lingerie glosses like the packaging
discs but very pretty good swatch candy
k the other day and when it did dry to
matt on my hand it looked very gorgeous
and this seems to be like one of the
most sought-after colors i'm seeing a
lot of people wear it and just say how
much they love it and so I was kind of
surprised that I actually was able to
get it in the order but very very happy
that I did and so let's move on to the
swatches of the glasses I can come back
and then show you a swatch when this is
completely dried down to Matt as well so
for the glasses the packaging see if I
can get it all uniformed this is what
the packaging looks like so a little bit
smaller it just comes with the gloss
there's no lip liner or anything that
comes with the glasses and so I will
swatch from lightest to darkest so the
lightest one is so cute so very very
similar packaging same style packaging
as the liquid lipstick mentioned mine
does have the shorter applicator so that
is what my applicator looks like right
there but to swatch it on my hand
so that one is so cute again this one is
the lightest of the three shades and I
will go ahead and apply to my lips as
well so you can see it on my lips
but so on my lips right now is so cute
as I'll have the swatch on my hand so
cute definitely the lightest one like I
said this is the only one that when I
did apply the other day that I found any
sort of streakiness with it so if you
can see in the demo as i'm putting that
on my lips i did find it to be a little
bit streaky if you just be generous with
the amount of product that you're
putting on i found that that did help
you know allocate the streakiness that
went away after that I do like this
color I special I think it will be
especially good as a topper I kind of
think it is a little bit like to light
on me maybe if I had a tan it would look
a little nicer but sometimes with my
pale skin and up like a very pale glossa
might not be the best combination but
for the summertime I thought this would
be a really pretty so again this one is
so cute alright the next one that we
have is literally and this is the middle
color this one was personally my
favorite color um I just thought it
looked the best on me so this one is the
middle shade
so that one is literally conceived just
a bit darker bit more Brown than so cute
and now to put it on my lips
right so this one on my lips is
literally like I said it's probably my
favorite one you'll see the next one is
in a little bit darker and I think too
dark for me right now but I thought this
one was just like my perfect shade
definitely my favorite def I can see
myself wearing literally quite a bit and
then the last shade is the darkest shade
and this is a like
so there is like you can see it is
definitely the darkest and it has I mean
just like the other three it really does
have good pigmentation so yeah here are
the three glasses now we'll go ahead and
add like to my lips
so this is the darkest shade this is in
like so honestly I thought it again as I
was putting it on now but even when I
was putting it on the other day for the
first time when I put that first like
Squatch on to my lips it truly felt like
I was putting on a lipstick because the
pigmentation is just so there it's
really crazy how awesomely pigmented
these are it's not just like a basic lip
gloss it definitely has color to them
and I really enjoy it so this one like i
said is the darkest shade definitely has
the most color to it definitely is the
darkest brown out of the three but i
like it i like like
all right guys and so that is all three
of the shades on my hand and then also
on my lips I really hope that you
enjoyed these swatches it was fun to do
and we'll say it actually wasn't super
easy removing the glasses to be able to
put on the next class obviously it
wasn't anything like liquid lipstick but
it still was hard to get it off and then
making sure that there was no other
pigmentation on my lips before I put the
next one on so it didn't like alter the
color in anyways so again the lasting
power on these pretty darn good alright
guys and that is everything for this
video I really hope that you enjoyed my
review and the swatches and live
swatches of the Kylie cosmetic lip
glosses again if you guys have any other
