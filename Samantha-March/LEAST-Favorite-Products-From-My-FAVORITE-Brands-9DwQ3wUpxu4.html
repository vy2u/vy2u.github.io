today's video is going to be all about
my least favorite products from some of
my favorite brands I got this idea from
my friend Olivia from live loves her
makeup I will link her video down below
I saw her do this video and I was like
genius I love it I'm gonna do this one
live and she was like yes can't wait so
that is what I'm gonna be doing today
I've picked out some of my favorite
brands I think I have ten different
brands here ten different items to show
you I'm going to be chatting about my
least favorite products from that brand
of course since they're my favorites I
love these brands but it doesn't matter
if one of your brands is your absolute
favorite typically they're gonna have a
product in there that doesn't fight with
you for whatever reason it might be it's
just how it goes hope that you guys
enjoy this video and why don't we go
ahead and get started
the first I'm gonna start with pure
cosmetics if you've been following my
channel for a while you know how much I
love Pierre I'm wearing the pure eye
lashes right now I have a lot of Pierre
in my collection I've been buying Pierre
cosmetics for a very long time but they
do have a product that just really
didn't work out for me this is their
bear doll 12-hour four in one skin
perfecting a foundation appeared did
send this over to me which was super
amazing I was so excited to get it I
love trying out new foundations and
seeing what works best for me and
unfortunately this one just did not work
first time I went to use it I was like
oh that is a thick foundation and I
remember I was actually trying it out
for the first time filming an Instagram
makeup tutorial just squeeze out the
foundation because it's in like the
squeezy tube and just like a thick glob
comes out and I tried to pull the bottle
away and the foundation stuck to the
sponge and then continued to stick with
the bottle I was like oh notice that
right off the bat I was like okay really
thick foundation but that's fine I can
work with it use a Beauty Blender
sometimes that's better whatever I did
not like the way it looked on my skin at
all I believe this is a demi matte
finish but it just it just did not do
flattering things for my face at all
it'll look like I was wearing foundation
it looked very heavy you think that this
was supposed to be a full coverage
foundation but it definitely feels and
looks full coverage and I am NOT a huge
full coverage foundation type of girl so
when I was able to really notice that I
was wearing foundation and I felt like
like I felt like every part of my face
was suffocating when I wore it I was
like ooh this is this is no good for me
alright a couple different times but
eventually I just had to say
we do not belong together the pure of
bear doll foundation we're just not a
match
so another foundation that just did not
work for me this from one of my favorite
brands which is Tarte cosmetics I loved
her I also have been buying from Tarte
for a very long time I actually as in
following this video have the Tarte web
so I pulled up and I put things in my
shopping cart so I do love tarts I
recommend them all the time I was super
excited when they were coming out with
their Amazonian clay stick foundation I
was like yes I can't wait I bought it
right away from the Tarte website I was
super stoked for it and then I was
really really disappointed I did do a
full video trying this out and reviewing
it and I was just like guys this is just
not working out for me
I actually I believe I did put it in my
makeup I've changed my mind about video
because I said I changed my mind for the
better I started to get a better handle
on how to use it and like what primers
to use with it and different things like
that but I can't just like reach for
this foundation I have to be careful
with primary I'm using I have to like
mix it in with a like cream bronzer
that's mostly for a shade match but
honestly for the finish as well it just
I didn't like the finish I thought it
made my face look super flat and just
with how almost kind of like
high-maintenance
this foundation stick is it's just not
one that I reach for I can't remember
the last time I reached for this stick
foundation it just did not work for me I
know a lot of people were like really
hyping this up and I was like nope
that wasn't for me so unfortunately the
dark lipstick foundation this has got to
be my least favorite product from the
brand another one of my favorite brands
so that I talked about a lot and
recommend quite a bit if Sigma Beauty
they did send me some of their loose
shimmers a while back and I was excited
for him because I was like okay
something different
I can try these out maybe it'll be fun
and they just really didn't do anything
for me I had a lot of trouble even just
kind of getting them out because more of
like the sifter inside and sometimes I
felt like I was having to like be there
forever I mean that's just the packaging
in general I have that problem with
pretty much any product that comes in a
sifter like that but then I felt like
unless you have like a super saturated
wet brush I was just kind of making a
mess all over my face we just didn't
really vibe we didn't get along too much
honestly it's probably more of just this
product in general it's why you don't
see me like working with a lot of loose
pigments or glitter
or shimmers like this we just don't
necessarily vibe but I was going through
my collection and trying to find the one
thing from Sigma that I was like that
really did not work for me because I
just I love Sigma so much and I know I
recommend them a lot but I was like
there's got to be something that didn't
work out for me and it was definitely
there loose shimmers and loose glitters
they were not for me so these would be
my least favorite from Sigma Beauty the
next time I want to talk about my least
favorite product from morphe and i'm
going to be giving you guys a little
sneak peek into my make up monthly for
the month of august i'm gonna be filming
in the next couple of days here this one
is going in my fail category it is the
concealers from morphe brushes oh man
I tried I really I tried really hard
morphe did send me a really nice package
with the collaboration that they did
with Britney bear so they sent me a set
of three different brushes and they also
were really nice to send along some
concealers and a like a powder contour
set I was excited to try out these
concealers because I hadn't tried them
yet and I love concealers concealer is
something that I wear on a daily basis
like no matter what I have to have my
concealer on and then I got a little bit
nervous cuz I was like I know a lot of
people off says they really hate / just
like these concealers but I was like
nope going to it open-minded you know
just you can do it I put it in a first
impressions video and I was like okay
mmm not the best but not the worst I'm
gonna keep trying like I really want it
really hard to like these concealers and
no no I don't like these concealers I
love the brushes from morphe I love the
eyeshadow palettes I've been trying to
flush palette I have a blush palette on
today that I think is really beautiful
but man these concealers are not my
friend they dry so incredibly fast on
the eyes and I realized that right away
and I was like no big deal I can just
put concealer under this eye and then
buff it out it'll be fine then go to the
other eye instead of how I've normally
just put concealer all over my face and
then go to town blending I was like no
problem but it's like even when you
blend it out immediately it's still
really cakey it emphasized like every
single crease in my eye I'm thirty years
old so I mean I got some creases on my
under eyes it emphasized all of them it
looked so bad no matter how I tried
brushes Beauty Blender setting powders I
really I mean I gave this one my all and
if we just do not work out
together so the morphe concealer was a
no-go next time I want to talk about uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills I think I can
confidently say my least favorite
product from Anastasia Beverly Hills is
not a subculture were you guys expecting
that no no it is her liquid lipsticks I
cannot vibe with these I think it was in
at my last lipstick to clutter I
actually declutter two of them I own
three i declutter two I kept one around
basically because I'm a freaking
youtuber and I can put it in videos like
this or I can do comparisons but I got
rid of the other two cos I was like I do
not wear these because I do not like
these at all I think Anastasia correct
me if I'm wrong in the comments but I
feel like I've heard people say I
Nastasia was kind of one of the first
ones to do the liquid lipsticks and
that's why you always heard people
referring to the honest as a liquid
lipsticks wearing them etc I can
remember I can remember going on a trip
to Kansas City and dragging my husband
and our two friends to like to different
malls because I was like I need to find
these liquid lipsticks I like was not
able to find them anywhere they were
sold out online I was going up to the
different counters in the malls I was
like please do you just have the anasazi
Beverly Hills look what lipsticks like I
need these everybody is talking about
them and then I finally got them and I'm
like what why why would you guys play me
like that
that was really rude they are an
incredibly MOSI formula which I have
come to find is just not something that
works out for me if they're very thick
on the lips they emphasize every single
line in your lips they're very cracky
they peel off very fast there are so
many other better amazing and even more
affordable liquid lipsticks out there
that no no Donna says they like the
lipsticks no go for me friend I'm gonna
talk about is Becca cosmetics I like a
lot of items from Becca cosmetics
specifically the highlighters I think
are fantastic
I was really excited to buy this primer
and it was very expensive and I am real
upset that it did not work for me this
is the fact light priming filter I mean
this is like probably the fanciest
primer that I had ever bought at this
time and I remember I kept thinking
about it
and I kept thinking about it I was
watching the reviews and everybody said
they loved it and I was like okay fine
I'm gonna buy it and I did I'm like wow
that sucks this did not die but well
with me at all I have pretty normal skin
like I'm not super oily and I'm not
super dry but when I put this on I just
look so oily I look greasy I look shiny
like it's not a primer that gives you
kind of a healthy glow pure has a primer
similar to this one it's I think it's
called there no filter primer it reminds
me of this one but better but a lot
better it doesn't make me like shiny
oily messy this just did not work for me
I tried it with so many different
foundations thinking okay maybe I'm just
you know maybe that foundation is to
glowy
you don't you know it don't pair it with
a glowy primer know with my mattifying
foundations I still just looked like a
hot mess so I'm super bummed about this
one because this was a pretty pricey
penny I tried so many times to get this
to work for me acolyte priming filter
from Becca was a no-go and then I'm
gonna wrap it up with some drugstore or
affordable brands one I have here is
from pixie beauty I enjoy pixie beauty
so much you're gonna see pixie mentioned
in my favorite section in my upcoming
makeup monthly I enjoy a lot that I
tried from pixie beauty but this lip
palette in collaboration with its duty
time was no good it was excited because
they sent this to me because I would
never purchase a lip palette myself I'm
not in working makeup artist I don't
need a lip palette it's just not a very
practical purchase for me I much prefer
just a regular single lipstick that I
can put in my bag versus having to bring
a lip palette but I was like okay cool
like you know that's really awesome I
got it sent to me I don't have to buy
something like this I can still be able
to try it out see what I think of a lip
palette I made no I mean I still you
know stand firm to the fact that a lip
palette just wouldn't be a practical
purchase for me but these are not
pigmented at all and I remember I did a
an unboxing of the full pixie prettiest
collaboration that they did with some
other Beauty influencers and you could
see my reaction on camera I was like
nothing is happening
like when you try to swatch these
nothing's really doing until some of
these darker colors they'll show up a
lot better but I don't wear those a lot
and these lighter shades up here nothing
was really doing they did not look good
on the lips that's just this did not
work out for me at all
next up I actually did mention these in
a recent make up monthly in the fail
section it is from ELF cosmetics I like
so much from elf I buy a lot from elf I
think they're an awesome affordable
brand but they're always doing big
things but unfortunately there are
lashes that they recently came out with
just do not work for me I am a bit of a
lash snob because I love false lashes so
much I I totally understand that I'm
very particular when it comes to my
lashes but these I could not get a
handle on at all these are what they
look like you can tell I tried I've
tried to make them work and I just could
not do it I don't know what it is about
the band the band is super thin and a
lot of times you like thin bands because
thick bands can be super incredibly hard
to work with they can look very obvious
so thin bands are usually better but
it's almost like these are too thin that
they just they just looked wrong they
just looked wrong on my eyes so
unfortunately the Alpha lashes we were
not compatible which is a big bummer
when wild I think is an awesome
drugstore brand they are so affordable
they're always coming out with a lot of
new items I like a lot of stuff from Wet
n Wild I have a few holy grails from Wet
n Wild that I like cannot live without I
got super pumped when I saw this release
and if you been watching my channel for
a while you probably don't know what I'm
talking about
I was super hyped for it people were
hyping it up everybody's putting on
YouTube video saying like this is the
best liquid lipstick ever and it's only
$4 and I'm like yes
can't wait no the when wild liquid cat
suit matte liquid lipsticks I despised
these and I was so upset because
everybody talks about these everybody
loves them everybody raves about them
they were in so many favorites videos
and I'm like what are you guys doing
that I'm not doing did I will get a bad
batch just the state of Iowa in general
we just we just got a bad one what
happened here remember going out and
buying like to look
lipsticks maybe and I tried them both
and I was like oh okay that that didn't
work out very well they again would show
off the lines they cracked right away I
mean that like the ugly like butthole
lips that you can get with like what
lipstick immediately started showing
with these I remember going to my
husband's hometown which is like an hour
and a half away from here and I was like
I'm gonna give him another chance like I
had that thought like that store those
two stars I tried two different stores I
bought from two different stores in my
town I was like must just be us so we go
to Mitch's hometown and I'm like hold on
real quick I'm just gonna run in to
Walgreens and I'm just gonna buy some
more lipsticks and I'm gonna try him out
no I hated all of them I think I bought
like five different shades none of them
worked for me not any of them the people
still enjoy these but for me they did
not work out at all I was super bummed
about that because I would love to fall
in love with a four-dollar liquid
lipstick but unfortunately the liquid
cat suits we were not friends fine I am
then I want to talk about in the final
brand that I'm going to talk about is
color pop I have a lot of color pop I've
been buying from colour-pop for a very
long time sometimes we're kind of hit or
miss just because sometimes they put out
so much it can get very overwhelming to
me but I did mention them and the
majority of these brands as well that I
just mentioned in the brands that I'm
very loyal to video that I recently
posted the ultra matte liquid lipsticks
from colour-pop I'm gonna have to say
that these are my least favorite from
the brand and if you would've talked to
me last year if you would have talked to
me two years ago I would have said these
are the best liquid lipsticks you would
have to have them but if you go back and
watch my videos I'm recommending them
I'm wearing them so much but I recently
put the ultra mattes in the makeup I've
changed my mind about because they do
some weird funky things like I feel like
they have a very short shelf life they
start to break up very strange they
change colors in the tubes I pulled out
a lipstick maybe like two or three weeks
ago it was one of my absolute favorite
colors from colour-pop loved it so much
I put it on my lips and I was like what
is this this is completely different
they just do very strange things and
when I mention that in the makeup
my mind about a lot of other people
wrote in and said that they noticed the
same thing and I was like I've never
heard anybody say anything to that
effect of the colour-pop ultra matte lip
so I'm like I'm glad some of you not
that I'm glad that you were having a bad
experience but I'm glad I wasn't the
only one having a bad experience because
I was like what is going on here I
totally understand that these are only
six dollars and that is a crazy
affordable price if you are someone who
you know you have like your five
lipsticks that you always go to and you
go through lipsticks a lot then totally
I honestly would recommend these because
of the price they are so super
affordable but if you are someone like
me who you have a larger lipstick
collection or you like to try a lot of
different lipsticks or you're always
using a lipstick and it's really hard
for you to go through an entire lipstick
it's honestly not even worth the six
dollars because there are other
affordable options out there that are
good or if you invest in a high quality
lipstick you can have it for a long time
without it going bad without it changing
color etc etc so unfortunately I'm
really I'm gonna have to say that the
ultra matte lipsticks from colour-pop
are my least favorite from the brand
okay so that's going to be everything
for my least favorite products from some
of my favorite brands I really hope that
you guys enjoyed this video or found it
fun to watch so I love all of these
brands that I mentioned I will
continually be purchasing from them and
recommending them but I thought it was a
lot of fun to go through and pick out
kind of my least favorite was I think
Liv said that she's also going to do her
favorite products from her least
favorite brands so if you guys would
