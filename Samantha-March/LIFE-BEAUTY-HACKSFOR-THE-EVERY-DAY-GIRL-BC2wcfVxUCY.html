today's video is going to be a hacks
video I'm gonna go over a few lifestyle
and beauty hacks that I use myself now
hack videos seem to be very popular here
on YouTube and especially like the
weirder ones I feel like are very very
popular but to be honest with you guys I
don't do any of those weird hacks like
I've watched the few videos because
hacks videos have been requested from me
and so I was watching a few of the other
hacks videos like what do people
consider hacks what truly is a hack and
some of the things that I've seen or is
just so bizarre and I'm like do people
actually really do that or what I mean
these hacks that I'm gonna show you how
I believe I have eight of them these are
things that I do in my everyday life or
I do everyday or is there things that I
actually do so I don't feel like any of
these things are super weird and out
there but I don't do super weird and out
there things I'm just gonna say it I
don't so I want to show you guys what I
actually do to make things easier for me
to make things more time-efficient for
me I even have a lot of different like
storage things in here as well so
hopefully it just helps you out I've
realized what the hack video is the ones
that aren't only focused on like really
weird things they actually do help me
out and give me ideas and so hopefully
these will give you some ideas too again
these aren't just things that I've seen
other people do this is what I do in my
everyday life and so yeah I just I hope
they help you out so again that I have
eight different lifestyle and beauty
hacks so why don't we just go through
them something that once I figured out
to do this it was like literally
life-changing
so my bathroom is upstairs on our second
level I have a small garbage can in my
bathroom of course and I was finding
that when my garbage can it was getting
too full and I would need to take it
downstairs to put it in the big trashcan
or take it outside to the actual
trashcan that we put on our curb
I would keep forgetting to bring up
another trash bag with me so then I
wouldn't take the trash out because then
I knew like if I did like the time so I
was like nope trash needs to go out and
I would tie it up and take it down with
me and then not bring a bag up then at
night I'd be you know removing my makeup
with
cotton ball or cotton pad and then I go
to throw it away and I don't have a
trash bag in there
it was literally so frustrating all of
the time and so the hack that I figured
out to do is just take a couple of trash
bags put them underneath the trash bag
that I have in there and so when I
actually go to take out the trash they
were already be at least one bag if not
more in there I can just take it out and
put it on the trashcan and we're all
good it seriously has saved me so much
time and once I figured out to do this
life-changing so the next hack is
something that I have been doing for
years and years and years and I never
actually realized that people will
consider this a hack until I started
seeing a pop-up and other like Beauty
hack videos as well and I was like wait
a second I do that too like does not
everybody do that and that is putting
like a facial mask in my shower so for
me sometimes I have a hard time finding
the time to do a face mask because you
have to let it sit for 5 10 15 even 20
minutes sometimes depending on what type
of mask it is that you're using and
sometimes I just don't have the time I'm
always running around my house like I
said my bathroom is upstairs so my face
masks are upstairs
I work downstairs in the office and I
just I just do not have the time to do
the face mask during the day but if I
put something in my shower what I will
do is usually when I have the
conditioner in my hair and I'm letting
it sit and work on my hair I will take a
face mask and just put that on and while
the conditioners in my hair I have a
face mask going that's usually when I
like shave my legs and stuff because
it's typically better to shave once
you've been in the shower for a while
that's typically when I will use my face
mask and since doing this I know that I
can at least get my face mask and you
know two to three times a week when I
like do my full-body shower and wash my
hair and all that and I'm not just like
rinsing off because I don't wash my hair
every day or even every other day
but the days that I am watching my hair
those are the days that I will do the
face mask in the shower it saves me time
it's efficient it's a good one so
another one is something that my husband
and I figured out when we moved into our
house when we lived in our condo our
laundry was like basically in our
kitchen almost we just had like a door
off the kitchen and the laundry was in
there but our big garbage can for our
kitchen was also right there so when we
would get ready to dry clothes and take
out the little like dryer lint thing
Giggy and you'd have to like
call the lane out of it and throw it
away our garbage can was just right
there so we could just easily put it in
the garbage but when we moved into our
house our laundry is actually on our
second level and we didn't have a
garbage so when we were taking out the
lint from the dryer we were having to
walk to either my bathroom or my
husband's bathroom we were dropping lint
that dog was eating the lint it was like
okay this is this is not going well so
what we did is we just went out and
bought like a really small trash can you
put a liner in there and then we are
getting ready to dry our clothes we can
take out the lint we can just throw it
in the in the trash can that we keep
like right on top of the dryer and it's
super easy it that way lint is not going
everywhere we don't have lint on our
carpet our dog not in danger of eating
dryer lint which is so girls and its
really been not only time efficient but
just just better for our house you know
so I don't know about you guys but I
have a problem with clutter
I have clutter everywhere it drives my
husband absolutely insane sometimes it
drives me insane but it's just how I
live I don't know I'm a clutter a type
of person but sometimes my drawers
especially well very very very much
overwhelm me
so the drawer that I'm showing you is in
my bathroom it's just on my right hand
side it's like my go-to jar I have hair
bands in there I have bobby pins I have
lotions I have hair stuff in there I
mean I have bracelets other jewelry
watches you name it it's not everything
goes in that drawer and when it gets so
full like what you see it is so
overwhelming and I figured out a super
super simple hack and that is simply
taking like little plastic containers me
and my husband often get like sliced
turkey and stuff like that at the
grocery store and they they come in
these plastic containers and they have
lids so when we're done we'll just clean
out those dishes really well and then
reuse them for storage so I just take
these little ones they fit so well into
my bathroom drawers and I have them
separated out like one has like hair
ties and bobby pins and bracelets
another one has like my lotions and lip
balms and things like that in there and
it just looks so much better and it's
just more organized and it's just easy
for me it's I mean it's basically free I
mean after we eat the turkey or whatever
it is that we're getting these
containers in and we just wash them out
and then we're able to reuse them for
storage and it has just made life so
much easier and cleaner looking another
storage idea is one that I've been doing
fairly recently I'll say with
like the past year I started doing this
and to drive me crazy when we would come
home from the grocery store and we would
have our paper towels and we would have
our toilet paper and we would like leave
it in the plastic and then it's just
frustrating when you're like needing to
get toilet paper out you're trying to
like mess with the plastic on it you're
trying to open more like it's just
easier for me to put everything away
just take you know take a few minutes of
my time take everything out and put it
away nicely and what I decided to do was
just take a extra laundry basket that we
had hanging around and I'll put all the
paper towels and all the toilet paper in
there I completely take them out of
their packages throw that away I send
them nicely in there and then I just put
it on the very bottom level of our
bathroom closet that way me and my
husband know if we ever need anything
like that's where it all is it looks
nice it's not messy it's not cluttered
we don't have to go searching for it
anytime like it's just it's been really
helpful and it was so funny because when
I was doing it my husband was kind of
like what are you doing and I explained
it he would goes that's actually a
really good idea and it looks nice so
like if anyone were to open that
bathroom closet it's not like things are
everywhere and things are super messy
that actually is a pretty organized
closet and I think it just looks nice
having the laundry basket there all the
paper goods are there makes life easy
also right in that bathroom closet as
well we have this like trash bag storage
thing now I've seen actually people
doing DIYs for this we got it as a gift
I think it was at our couple shower
before we got married a friend got us
this but I've also seen DIYs if you guys
are interested but I think this was
purchased from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond but
basically we can just put our trash cans
like in the tap you just open the little
slot we put our trash bags in there and
when I say like trash bags for like our
bathroom trash bags and even like the
dryer the trash cans for the dryer as
well these are just reused bags from
like Target Heidi at the grocery store
or CVS whatever we just keep the bags
once we take everything out we put them
in this little storage guy and then when
we need a new little trash bag for our
trash cans in our bathrooms and for the
dryer and things like that we can just
go in there and you can you just grab
one out of the bottom it's super easy
it's super handy it's on the wall it's
not like cluttering anything up it
doesn't look messy or sloppy or anything
like that and it's really been not only
like a
favorite but it just kind of like looks
better as well we don't ever have like
trash bags just like piling up somewhere
random they're in their own little spot
here so that really helps us out and
that thing hasn't really come in handy a
hack that I have is reusing things that
we have around the home as well a lot of
times my husband will like pickle things
or cam things I don't even know if I'm
saying that right but he like does
canning things I don't know he has the
garden I have no part of this but it's
something that he really enjoys doing or
else we will even buy like canned foods
again when I say we I mean he he will
buy like canned pickles and things like
that to eat and then once we were done
with that he'll rinse out the mason jars
and we will reuse them for really
anything around the house but one thing
that I've been using the mason jars for
recently is makeup storage so I just
take these regular old mason jars that
can be reused I just make sure I clean
them out really well and then I use them
for brush storage and I also use them
for like liquid lipstick storage I have
four mason jars above my desk it feels
like colour-pop lipsticks I have one
that has like even little things of like
hand cream sunscreen hand sanitizer is
in them I reuse these mason jars all the
time sometimes I'll keep them plain or
you see the one in the video that we
actually just went out and bought a can
of spray paint I think it was like a
mint green spray paint we spray paint at
that and then I put some fake flowers in
it and then I have like a pretty decor
just from a simple mason jar that we can
reuse it's really easy and it helps for
my storage situation because I'm
starting to get a lot more makeup and I
don't have a lot of places to store them
so I just keep grabbing up those mason
jars every time we get one to reuse I'm
like yes please I'm gonna take that
mason jar but we also use it for like
home decor as well and it just works out
really well and then the last hack that
I found is one that I feel like I
learned about a long time ago I really
am not sure who it wasn't introduced me
to it or where it is that I found it but
it's something that I really like to do
and that is just putting like a scented
dryer sheet underneath our trash can
this is one that I really only do for
the trash can in the kitchen because
it's the one that like can smell the
most but I just think it's like super
embarrassing when your house can smell
are you up guests over and they like go
to put something in the garbage
you can all smell what's in your garbage
and because it's just me and my husband
who live here we don't really go through
garbage quite a bit as like people with
a bigger family so our trash will stay
in the garbage cans for a long period of
time and it can really start to get
quite smelly so what I do is just take a
scented dryer sheet and I put it at the
very bottom of the trash can and then I
take the trash bag and just put it right
over that and I think that it really
does help mask it the scent that's just
something that's really easy to use and
I don't have to change the dryer sheet
like every single time I change the
garbage I can usually do like at least
two if not three times depending on how
fast we're going through our garbage so
it's not like you're wasting dryer
sheets or anything and I just really
think it helps masking the scent of your
garbage so that is a hack that I like to
use very frequently everything for my
live style and beauty hacks video I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
maybe you'll learn something new maybe
you learned that we do something the
same because that always makes me like
weirdly happy when I see other youtubers
and they mentioned something like the
face mask in the shower I'm like wait I
do that too like other people do that
too like it's just exciting to see what
we have in common so if you guys do any
of these hacks or you want to try out a
new hack that I learned please just
really be a comment below because I
would love to know that if there's any
other certain type of hack videos that
you guys want to see let me know like I
said I don't do anything weird or crazy
and I'm not gonna pretend to just so I
can make a video about it but if you'd
like to see me like testing out any sort
of hacks whether they be lifestyle or
beauty or whatever you have it if you
want to see me try out these hacks to
let you know if they really work maybe
that could be an interesting video
because I swear some of these are just
like so bizarre and out there but
whatever it is that you guys want to see
I want to make the videos for so just
leave me some comments below or if you
don't really need to see any other hack
videos that's fine too but I just always
like to get your guys's feedback in
suggestions because it really helps me
out when I'm planning my filming
schedule and so that is gonna be it for
