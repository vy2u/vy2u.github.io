video should just be a short declutter
video I'm going to be decluttering my
lip glosses and then I also just have
like a few little lip balms down there
so I thought I would throw them in here
because you can see I don't have a huge
lip gloss collection especially compared
to my last lipstick de-clutter which
I'll have my declutter playlist linked
down below but still I'm not a big
lipgloss person and I don't wear it a
ton so this is a far too many lip
glosses for me so I want to do some
decluttering so why don't we go ahead
and get started
know how much I'll swatch since they
aren't the losses they kind of are tough
to swatch but we'll just we'll just go
ahead and see but I'll just start with
kind of my bombs right here since
there's only a few of them so I have
this one from Dior it's the Dior lip
glow and I actually really do like this
one I took this one out of my purse to
film this video because it's a nice balm
it's not like super sticky it's not
super waxy but it also has a slight pink
tint to it hello Samantha it also has a
slight pink tint to it which some days I
don't want and that's when I reach for
the glossier which also resides in my
purse
but somedays I do want just a little bit
of color on my lips and so I like having
this one in my purse for that so I'm
gonna go ahead and keep that one and
then like I said this one was also in my
purse this is from a glossier it's the
coconut bomb calm you can see Aries
tried her hardest to get at this one day
and I was like no girl no you don't this
is one of my favorite lip balms it is
awesome for the lips it is super just
like hydrating and just like nourishing
for the lip skin in frame and it's just
it's one of my favorite lip balms I feel
like this one has a lot of chatter to it
but for a good reason it's one of my
favorites and it has a really nice scent
to it as well and I feel like it makes
your lips off really enjoy this one I am
going to keep it this one here is a
fresh it's one of their sugar lip
treatments and honey so this one this
one is kind of interesting to me because
it is like a lip balm but it also like
instead of the Dior one where it just
has like a slight tint this one really
gives you like lip color so a lot of
times when I'm reaching for my lip balms
I want like a very sheer color or I
don't want any color and this is
like I don't know it's kind of like
in-between I've also had it for a while
and it's been open for a while and I
just don't reach for at a ton
I even put it by my desk and I still
don't reach for it a ton so I'm gonna
actually go ahead and declutter that one
this next one here is from drunk
elephant this is their lippy bomb I
actually do not like this product it was
one of the first ones that I started
trying out from drunk elephant and one
of the first products that I reviewed
and I was like you know what I actually
don't like this it's very waxy it
doesn't stay on the lips a ton and it
makes my lips feel super dry like I feel
like I have to constantly be reapplying
this when I was testing it out so I
actually do not like this so I'm gonna
put that in my past pile as well and
then this last one here is also from
fresh it's one of their sugar lip
treatments and pearl this one I actually
really do like and I'm I'm almost out of
it I can tell that it feels pretty light
in here is the shear on the lips but it
has like the slightest hint of something
to it but it's really beautiful and
again it's just like really nourishing
for the lips so this one I do like so
I'm gonna go ahead and keep that one so
just out of the bum's I'm gonna go ahead
and keep these three and then I'm gonna
go ahead and declutter these two so
that's where we're starting off with but
to actually go into my classes so you
can see here that I obviously have some
from Urban Decay it was sent to me in
the pr package I'm gonna deal with those
laughs I'm gonna go through those laughs
and see how we do this first one here
let's hop into it this one is from a
Fendi beauty this is the gloss bomb
I don't mind this lip gloss I'm gonna go
ahead and keep it because it was a
pricey lip gloss I honestly wish I would
have just gotten the mini honestly for
any lip gloss I feel like I should just
get minis because I don't wear them a
ton this was pricey I I like it but I
don't love it I wish I would have or
maybe I got it on sale I can't remember
what I picked it up but it's okay but
I'm gonna go ahead and keep it I said I
have this one here from woosh Beauty
which I believe can be found at Ulta
they sent me a PR package but the lip
gloss just really didn't do anything for
me and keep in mind I'm just not a
lipgloss person don't reach for them a
ton but this one didn't really do
anything for me wow me so I'm gonna put
that one in the past pile let's see I
have this one here oh this is from
Maybelline it's one of the
Vivat hot lacquers my makeup monthly for
the month of April should be up I will
have it linked down below and I put this
in the film category so I'm going to
declutter this one I do not like this
it's very sticky it transfers onto my
lips do not like this I'm gonna go ahead
and declutter that one I also have this
one here from dose of colors and this is
very sad to me this is a newer purchase
to me it's in honey I'm home again I
said I was gonna be swatching and I've
kind of been doing a terrible job but
let me see if I can swatch this one
actually has some pigment to it so
that's how I thought of it there's honey
I'm home and it's kind of one of those
colors when I did my lipstick collection
declutter I declutter a color similar to
this from dose of colors out of my
collection it's just not a super
flattering shade on me and it just
correlates to the gloss as well and the
gloss was pretty sticky like pretty
thick and sticky so it wasn't my
favorite and kind of bummed that I
didn't save my receipt I just figured as
dose of colors and I was gonna love it
so I didn't save my receipt and I wish I
would have but unfortunately I'm just
going to go ahead and put that one in my
past pile I have this one from Tarte
this is a little mini guy it probably
came in a set I'm assuming this is one
of their glossy lip paints and I don't
know if it has I don't see a shade name
on it so not sure what this shade is but
I also don't really love the tarte
glossy lip paints oh that one has a bit
of pigment to it as well it's a nice
pink but I remember trying this out and
just not really loving it as well and
again just with not being a gloss person
I'm really trying to get this collection
down a little bit so I'm also going to
go ahead and declutter this one okay so
to keep it moving I have this one here
from Too Faced and this is one of their
peach oils the creamy peach oil lip
gloss this is in pure peach this one
really doesn't have much of a swatch to
it I think I just featured it recently
in my lip pics video so that's how I
know but I actually really do like these
I love the way that they smell it's a
really nice like really a combination
between an oil and a lip gloss and I
feel like it feels really nice on the
lips and it has that nice like peachy
pink tone to it as well so I really do
like these I'm going to go ahead and
keep that one
this next one here is from buxom I was
super happy to find this I misplaced
this for a hot second I finally found it
but this is a buxom in White Russian
this one might be a little bit hard to
see as well that one is white Russian
and I really do like these this is a
little mini guy as well because it came
in a set but I really do like these they
have a bit of a plumping factor to them
this one I mean you can see from the
swatch it's pretty sheer but it has like
a light tint to it but it's a really
nice gloss I don't find these to be
overly sticky I really do like these so
I'm gonna go ahead and keep that one
this next one here is from let's go to
the site this next one here is oh this
is from Lancome I got this sent to me
from actally and I just have actually
really enjoying it this is in 222 this
is called like there that's very strange
that it doesn't have the name on it for
Lancome hello it's called like the
absolute gloss or something like that
these are pricey but I actually really
like them there's a little swatch of
that there if you can see that I really
do like this one it's sheer but it has a
bit of a nice shimmer to it and again I
just really like the way it feels on the
lips it's it's not sticky in the
slightest it just feels like really
smooth for a lip gloss I think these are
really nice so I'm gonna go ahead and
keep that one too I have two here from
Marc Jacobs and these are both in sugar
sugar I purchased the full-size and then
the mini came and like a you know
Sephora favorites new and the mini came
in like one of the Sephora collection
sets I really do like both and I I'm
that person who keeps my mini and my
full-size usually because my minis I
take traveling or in my clutch with me
my full sizes I just like to have in my
makeup collection but I really do enjoy
this glass I think it's really beautiful
and again it has just like the slightest
bit of a shimmer to it nothing super
overwhelming just the slightest
slightest a little bit but the Marc
Jacobs sugar sugar you're a nice one so
I'm gonna go ahead and keep that one too
and then I have this one here from
Pierre and let's see there's a mirror on
the back let's see this is in birthday
suit I know I don't really enjoy the
Pierre glasses I tried this one out for
a while again it just didn't really do
anything for me so I'm just gonna go
ahead and pass that one on this one here
is from
Asya Beverly Hills again this one is a
mini and this is in Kristen I believe it
is this one came in one of the Sephora
sets as well and I actually really like
her glasses they are pretty intense for
a gloss like a look at that swatch they
are pretty intense for a lip gloss like
color payoff wise but I'm really happy
that I like this because I don't love
her liquid lipsticks and I don't love
her matte lipsticks but I do like her
glasses so that's good so I'm gonna go
ahead and hang on to that one and then
let's see okay this is another one from
Pierre so this one is in squad and yeah
I'm gonna go ahead and declutter this
one for my camera but focus
I'm gonna go ahead and declare this one
too again it has a bit of a shimmer to
it I used it for a while but Pierre I
don't know if your lip products don't
get me going a ton from the brand so
I'll go ahead and pass that one on to
and then I have some here from the Mac
and Patrick Starr collaboration this was
their first collaboration that they did
so I believe I think I'd declutter it
out the darker one like the red gloss
say so the shades are she better work
and Mama star and so there these two
swatches up here the pink is a she
better work and the other one is Mama
star I like Mac lip glosses I mean you
can see I have several here that I'll
have to go through I do like Mac glosses
but I think I'm just gonna go ahead and
keep the pink one she better work and
declutter the darker one just cuz I
don't wear a lot of darker lip glosses
so that's what I'm gonna do for those
and then I have a butter gloss yeah a
butter gloss from NYX this is in a
fortune cookie that is super super light
I do like the Knicks glasses though and
I got this one off a recommendation I
think it was from a lesser Lux or Katy
and I really do like it and I like that
really really sheer color cuz that's
nice to use with a lipstick that does
have a good amount of color but I just
want that mmm
gloss so I'm gonna go ahead and keep
this one already so then we're gonna
start in with the Mac lip glasses so you
can see my lip glosses here from Mac now
I did get a PR package from Mac and
that's where the majority of these came
from I did give away a few and like I
gave some to friends as well put some
and giveaway packages and such but these
were the ones that
decided to keep and I know right off the
bat that there are some of these that I
have never used I just kind of kept in
my collection like yeah I'm gonna use
these Monday I'm gonna use these Monday
and then I did it so these three are
nuevo lemonade and myths these have
never been opened never been used or
swatch from me so I can go ahead and
give these away those are going to go in
my past pile right off the bat like
there's no reason that I can need to
keep saying like maybe one day I'll like
use those like no you're not going to
okay this one here is under the sheets
in my correct yes this one here is under
the sheets this is probably my most used
mac lipglass and I think it's absolutely
beautiful I can't remember now if this
one was one that was in collaboration
with Nicki Minaj but I reach for this
one a lot and I really enjoy it so I'm
definitely going to be keeping under the
sheets another one that I really like is
candy box which is this one right here
okay I just want to make sure I feel
like I can tell just looking at them but
then I also want to make sure but this
one is candy box and this is one that I
like to wear over like a pink lipstick
it's just a nice like I mean it's a
really pink gloss say that mac lipglass
formula isn't like hands-down my
favorite but I still reach for them
quite a bit night I do still use them
and you don't get use out of them so I'm
gonna go ahead and keep candy box too
and then I have these two left to make a
decision on so we have a nude and also
culture to those last two swatches and
those ones are very like I mean I feel
like you can tell the swatches that
they're just a lot more light and sheer
than the other ones that I typically
like a lot so I'm actually gonna go
ahead and put those in the past pile
again trying to keep in mind that I'm
trying to cut down my collection I don't
reach for these a ton and I feel like
with my other two glosses I feel like I
get a lot of use out of them for my mac
glosses so okay now let's go ahead and
move on to my Urban Decay lip glosses
because clearly something needs to be
done here oh I also got these in PR from
Urban Decay and like I said I already
gave some away I gave them to friends I
put some in giveaway packages these were
the ones that I decided to keep for
myself and I was like maybe I'll try
this out so there's already been some
one here that I have never try
once again I've never tried and I
haven't had him as long as the Mac but
I've still had him a decent time so if
I've never tried them I need to go ahead
and kick them out of my collection
that's pretty much half of what I have
so that's fun so we have dirty talk and
also jawbreaker also obsessed beso big
bang and then this last one here is
candy flip so these are all glosses that
I was like maybe someday I will use
these and I still haven't so since I've
never been open they've never been
swatched I can put them in giveaway
videos I can make my friends happy I
just need to go ahead and say goodbye to
them so these are the ones that we have
left I just wore this one the other day
this is in gold mine it's honestly not
as intimidating as it looks in here I
just I wore this over a lipstick and I
just thought it looked really cool it
didn't really leave it like a yellow
gold it just kind of gave it some like
gold shimmer I would say I thought it
was pretty cool and pretty unique so I'm
gonna go ahead and keep that one this
one I actually have on my lips at this
moment I just got done filming another
video because I am pre filming for my
Oklahoma trip this is in rapture and I
really like this gloss I think that it's
a nice color and again I'm wearing it
today I do want to keep this one
I like the urban decay HiFi shine lip
glosses they're $20 and I feel like
that's pretty high for a lip gloss for
me but these are nice lip glosses again
I don't know if I'd really be able to
say like what is my favorite formula of
lip gloss because I'm not a big lipgloss
person but these are pretty decent
they're not sticky at all and I feel
like they look pretty flattering on the
lips
this one was another fun one this is in
SPL I wore this in another video like
when everyone was doing like Coachella
looks the most Coachella I got was like
kind of putting on a shimmer lip gloss
and I was like yeah look at me this one
is really pretty too I want to keep this
one for you know when I want to wear
shimmer lip gloss I don't know how often
that will be but I've been in that mood
so I'm gonna go ahead and keep this one
this one is one of my favorites this is
in a fuel yeah I feel like a lot of
people really have been enjoying fuel
I've been seeing this pop up in
favourites videos and such like that's
just a nice gloss you can wear this
gloss on its own for just like a slight
tint or you could wear it
over another lipstick but yeah that
one's really pretty as well this one
here this is in midnight cowgirl and
this one let me swatch it and see what I
think yeah this one kind of has like
peachy tones like a very slight peachy
vibe to it but I remember this one I was
kind of disappointed and I put it on one
day and I was like I feel like I need
something a little bit more in my lip
gloss so I'm actually gonna go ahead and
declutter that one and then this next
one here is in 1993 which 1993 is one of
my favorite lipsticks from urban decay
and it's just I mean it's that in a
gloss and I think it's really nice again
this one could be worn as a standalone
or over a darker lipstick but this one's
really pretty so I'm going to keep that
one and then the last one I have here is
in naked again I love the naked lipstick
from Urban Decay so this one I do also
want to keep I liked that gloss I've
worn it over the Naked lipstick as well
because I just thought the hose to
belong together so this one is really
nice too so I'm gonna go ahead and keep
this one so let me pull up my piles
together and let's see how we did
I have some very exciting news to share
so in this pile up here already in the
container is the lip glosses that I'm
keeping everything else on the outside
of it is what I'm decluttering so I am
keeping 20 and decluttering 21 I don't
know if I have ever done in declutter
where I have decluttered more then I
have kept so I'm sorry ladies and
gentlemen I know it's only 1 but I'm
feeling pretty proud of myself at the
moment so that's awesome that makes me
feel a lot better again you know I've
been saying it I'm not a lipgloss person
I don't reach for them a lot so to have
over 40 lip glosses was a little
ridiculous so I'm super happy that I cut
that in half yes you go girl and I have
a lot here that like I said have never
been opened I can actually give them
away so that's pretty freakin cool as
well but I'm pretty excited about this
this makes me very happy that it's going
to do it for my lip gloss slash my tiny
little lip balm collection over here I
hope that you guys enjoyed seeing a
declutter video again I will have my
declutter a playlist linked down below
in case you want to see others and I do
have two other very recent lipstick
collection D clutters as well they're
kind of divided into
/ colourful lipsticks and then nudes and
nudes and more needs that one was a big
one but thank you guys so much for

one as always if you did I hope that
