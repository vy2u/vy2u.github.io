so today's video is going to be a
lipstick declutter so obviously a bit of
a different format here and this is
actually the first time i'm doing a
video like this but recently my lipstick
collection has also gone a little bit
out of hand i mean i'm sure this is not
bad compared to a lot of other youtubers
but for me it's making me very stressed
out and I don't have enough lipstick
storage for all this and I just needed
to make a change go through declutter a
few things some lipsticks I never even
wear some are just old and need to be
thrown away so I thought it would take
you through my lipstick declutter do I
really am not sure the best way to do
this like I said this is my first time
doing something like this so I'm just
going to grab out random lipsticks and
go through them let you guys know what I
think so the first one that I picked up
is from NYX it is the butter gloss in
fortune cookie so I actually just bought
this one obviously I'm going to be
keeping this one since I did just buy it
but I have not tried any of the NYX
butter glosses oh definitely will be
keeping this one so the next one is a
Maybelline lipstick and this is in rum
Richie so maybelline has some of like my
favorite formulas for lipsticks and they
are affordable which is amazing i love
them rum richie is one of my favorite
lipsticks to use for the fall it's a
really pretty like deep brown color and
i will definitely be keeping this
another Maybelline lipstick that i have
is truffle tease this is a beautiful
like light brown shade obviously I don't
want to swatch all of these for you
because I would run out of hands arms
and feet to swatch these but a beautiful
light brown bit of a glossy shade it's
gorgeous I wear it so often it's been
mentioned in favorites videos I have to
keep this one well let me love her some
very concerned how this declutter is
going to go we shall see but the next
one that I picked up is from NYX and
this is one of their soft matte lip
creams and it is in the shade Milan is a
very hot pink but it is so pretty like I
love the formulas of the soft matte lip
creams from NYX so this is going in the
keep pile this is a lipstick from sigma
beauty they actually send it to me it's
in spades and it's one of their power
six I actually have not used this yet
i've swatched it and it looks gorgeous
like a very neutral pinky nude I would
say but because i have not even been
able to like try this out yet obviously
I want to keep it and try it out okay so
next up we have from Gerard cosmetics
this is the shade buttercream and this
is super super sticky this leaks I don't
know it apparently broke at some point
and I'm going to be tossing it just
because I've had it for so long and
obviously it's leaking like I wouldn't
want to take it anywhere with me but
truly I don't even like these it was
very disappointing i bought these
because this was a collaboration with
jaclyn hill and i was really really
disappointed in these lip glosses they
are super super sticky it's just
basically impossible to wear them and
was definitely my favorite out of the
bunch shade wise but formula wise I just
know so this is going in the top style
so next up I have from NYX it's one of
their lingerie liquid lipsticks in
ruffle trim honestly I love these Nick's
lingerie formulas I know it's like very
hit or miss with people like you either
love them or you hate them and I one who
loves them ever just need like a really
good new to wear this is what I'm
grabbing so I'm keeping this one then I
have one of the two face melted
lipsticks and this one is in melted
strawberry it's a really intense like
glossy red and honestly I do not like
these two face melted lipsticks I have
mentioned them before about how I'm just
not impressed with them and they just
they run they bleed outside the lips
they're really hard to keep on and they
just transfer so much like I just cannot
get behind these I know so many people
love them but I am one who just does not
like these so i will be putting this in
the toss pile from maybelline i have one
of their baby lips and i'm not sure i
know they come in different shades this
one is like a pink shade and honestly
I've had this one I mean it's been like
years and years since I've had these I
have so many different baby lips in my
collection but I truly don't really like
the ones that have a tint to them like
this one
it's like almost like a hot pink tint to
the lips and I actually don't like that
so I'm going to toss this mostly just
because it is really old I have a color
pop ultra matte liquid lipstick this one
is in bumble it's a really pretty like
unique almost like red brown shade I
think it's really cool looking this is
just a gay really unique shade so I
would definitely want to hold on to this
one so i have another of the NYX soft
matte lip cream this one is in London
this is like a gorgeous brown nude this
is one of my favorites to where I find
myself reaching for it so often i will
definitely be keeping this one of
another Maybelline lipstick like I said
Maybelline has some of my favorite
favorite formulas if you're looking for
a good drug store purchase check out
Maybelline's this is from there Matt
collection and this is in clay crush
this is a gorgeous like nude brown color
but it has a matte finish to it which
just makes it so gorgeous it's one of my
favorite lipsticks to where I'm
constantly recommending this one I may
or may not have bought this because I do
have a crush on clay matthews who plays
for the Green Bay Packers so there's
that so then I have another baby lips
here from Maybelline and I realized that
the the names are written on the side of
it here so this one is called Ruby star
and again I had this for so long but I
remember I really didn't like this one
because it left like such a weird like
red tint to the lips like almost like
you've been drinking kool-aid or
something and I just looked kind of
bizarre so this will go on the toss pile
so another ultra matte liquid lipstick
from colour-pop this one is in teeny
tiny it's like a very dark brown pink I
would say it's a really cool color and I
really do like the clock the colour-pop
ultra matte and they are only six
dollars which is super affordable so
i'll be keeping this one but next up I
have from Kyle a cosmetics this is one
of the lip glosses the shade is in like
which is a really pretty like brown
almost kind of like PG Brown I would say
though I just recently got these but
honestly I have all three of the glasses
and i truly really do like them I like
that they're not sticky at all whereas
opposed to like the Gerard cosmetics or
is so sticky it's pretty much unwearable
I think these
very very wearable and long-lasting and
I do think there are really good gloss
so i'll be keeping this next up from
l'oreal i have their Blake's red so
lore'l has a couple different
collections with celebrities I believe
they have nudes and now Reds I have the
Blake's red which looks like this and
honestly is not like a true red when I
first start to apply it it comes off as
like a pinky red and I honestly have not
been able to find just a true red for my
collection I will keep it it's not my
favorite by any means and I really don't
like the smell of the L'Oreal lipsticks
but I really don't have too many reds in
my collection and what I need to reach
for a one like I need to have some so
that's why I'm keeping it but I hope to
find a good true red soon though next up
I have a lipstick and this is from
Gerard cosmetics and this is in the
shade tequila sunrise and it is like a
very cool like orange coral color
honestly I love the color of this I
think it's very unique but the formula
is so so crappy I mean after maybe like
three where's of this it was completely
dried out it would like flake on my lips
i am not a fan of the jar cosmetics
lipstick formulas their lipsticks or
their lip glosses and i will definitely
be putting this in the tas style okay so
then I have another of the two face
melted lipsticks this one is in melted
jelly donut if I had to pick a favorite
I guess this would probably be my
favorite out of the melt at ones that I
have it's a really cool like bright pink
color but again I can't get behind the
formula I never want to wear it because
it ends up all over my face so this one
will be tossed so then I do have another
of the L'Oreal lipsticks from the
celebrity collection and this one is
from the nude collection so this is
Jennifer's nude as in Jennifer Lopez if
you can see this is all the lipstick
I've left I have had this for quite some
time but it really is one of my favorite
nudes I don't like the smell of the
L'Oreal lipsticks like at all but that's
okay I really love this color there's
another one from Gerard cosmetics this
one is in fire engine so again I bought
this thinking it would be like a really
true red it's not it's definitely much
more of a pink red and again it's just
pretty much unwearable to me it is so
dry and flaky on the lips so
the wife from colour-pop this is one of
their ultra matte this one is in beeper
beeper is such a loved shade this is
like a very like cool tone brown gray
and I absolutely love it I feel like
it's a favorite of so many will
definitely be keeping this leaves us in
my Ipsy bag it is from tarps and it's a
lipsurgence I believe in wonder I did
swatch it and put it on my lips and I'm
really upset that I did because I
probably could have given it away I knew
instantly that I wouldn't want it
because I don't enjoy like the krann
lippies like they're just not my
favorite but it was in my first FC bag
and I did like a tutorial on everything
that was in that Ipsy bag and I wish I
hadn't because I could have given this
away I've used it once but I'm probably
never going to use it again so maybe
you'll see if a friend wants it another
one from colour-pop and their ultra
masks clearly I love the color pop ultra
math and they're only six dollars so i
have so many of them but this is in
sallow which is a beautiful like
everyday pink color it has like a bit of
like uh like it's not like a real
neutral pink it has a bit of a pop to it
and I absolutely love it so this is a
tortoise lip paint from Tarte cosmetics
and it is in the shade so fetch as you
can see it is a super bright pink color
now I really like the TARDIS lip paint
formula it's again this is like one
that's like hit or miss for people it's
definitely like it does not dry
completely matte like most liquid
lipsticks I can pair it more to the NYX
soft matte lip cream but I enjoy it
because it's much more comfortable on
the lips and you can reapply it if you
need to like what the color pops and
even like anastasiya you can't really
reapply those as a liquid lipstick or
it's just going to chunk up I truly love
this color I love the formula and I will
be keeping this one have a liquid
lipstick from Anastasia Beverly Hills
this one is in Dulce it's a really
pretty like muted quarrel I actually
just mentioned it in my I think it's my
most recent favorites video my June
favorites video so of course I'm keeping
it so this is a pink lipstick that came
in like an elf kit I mean it's nice and
it's okay but I never reached for it
because there's so many other formulas
that I like so much better so I'm going
to put this in the ta's style other
color pop ultra matte liquid lipstick is
in clueless the
is one of my favorite favorite lipsticks
like from colour-pop and also just in
general I love clueless so much it's
such a beautiful neutral everyday pink
color I know I say I have a lot of those
in my collection but this one seriously
is one of my favorites of course I'm
keeping clueless this one is from kat
von d and it is in the shade bow and
arrow such a cool nude brown color and I
ended up really loving it so I'm going
to keep this one and I have another
melted lipstick from to face this one is
in melted fig it's a really neat like
purple color and again I do like this
color but once again it's going to end
up like on my nose and in the center of
my forehead so gonna toss this one then
another baby lips from Maybelline I'm
telling you guys like I have so many of
these baby lips it's kind of ridiculous
but this is another one that left like a
weird and you can see how dirty it is
have obviously had it for a way too long
but it left just like a weird like kool
aide stain on my lips so tossing this
one so this is another one from Gerard
cosmetics and it is in rose hill again
this was a collaboration with jaclyn
hill and again i just was very
disappointed in these and it's a really
cool shade it's kind of like a brick red
almost with a gloss to it and i was so
excited this was one of the first like
big purchases that i made because of
YouTube and I absolutely fell in love
with jaclyn hill when i started watching
her and i just cannot get over how
disappointed I was in these lip glosses
Oh obviously I'm not gonna keep this one
either this is another one from
colour-pop this is in Chile Chile which
actually is like one of my favorite
colors it's a very pretty like deep red
brown shade and I love the color but the
formula on this one I don't know why but
it is super super different it is very
runny and very liquidy I don't know I
love the color I'm going to keep wearing
it but just something about this one the
formula is just weird so this is
actually a new product from Maybelline
it's one of their color jolts and
stripped down so I just got this but
I've actually worn it quite a few times
because I love it this formula to me is
very similar to the two face melted
formula but so much better because it
does not move super long-lasting like
even though it's not a liquid lipstick
and it's more of a gloss it stays on the
lips for so long I was really impressed
with the longevity of this definitely
keeping this this is another one from
Maybelline and this one is in deepest
cherry so this is a really really dark
like almost like black cherry color it's
so cool for the fall one of my favorites
to wear and again i love the Maybelline
formula so definitely keeping this this
is another one from Gerard cosmetics
this is in the shade underground I was
like so excited for the shade because it
was the first kind of like cool grey
lipstick that I bought when the graves
were becoming really popular i bought
this one and i do like the color this is
probably the best formula i don't know
if it was because i bought it separately
from the others that i have mentioned
like this formula came a little bit
later so i don't know if it was better
because of that because it's definitely
not like as dry and weird on the lips
but still i really don't even appreciate
Gerard cosmetics as a company anymore
I've just seen too many like weird
things about them and I've made the
decision not to purchase from them
anymore so even though I like the color
of this one I have more greys in my
collection and I'm going to get rid of
this one so we have another one from
colour-pop and this one is in Lumiere
too so I bought this one because it was
a collaboration with kathleenlights who
I really enjoy watching here on YouTube
it's a really beautiful like it's a pink
but it's I don't know how to describe
this one honestly cuz to me it's like a
purplish pink it's a very unique color
and I really like it and yeah I
definitely have to keep this one I have
another of the knicks lingerie lippies
and this one is in bedtime flirt again
this is just such a beautiful nude shade
and like i mentioned i do really enjoy
the next lingerie ones i don't think
they're going to be for everybody but
especially ruffle trim and bedtime flirt
I love them have to keep them this is
from colour-pop it says one of their
lippie Stix and it is in the shade
westie it's a really pretty pink color
again it almost kind of reminds me of
like the Milan from NYX except
it's a little bit lighter like it's not
quite as bright but I really do like the
lippie Stix from colour-pop I think
they're really unique and cool so I will
be keeping this one another color pop
ultra matte this is in the middie again
one of my first purchases from
colour-pop this is a really like cool
toned nude pink color and very neutral
and I will be keeping this one and then
from a covergirl this is their Oh sugar
lip balm it's in the shade candy I just
mentioned this in my most recent
favorites video so obviously I'm going
to keep this one but this is what I have
by my desk that I just use all the time
to keep my lips as hydrated as i can and
i love it then from maybelline this is
another one of their matte lips and this
is in the lipsticks roll this is in
touch of spice again this is a really
great color for fall because it's almost
just like a spicy red brown color so i
will be keeping this is another one from
Kylie cosmetics it's the only liquid
lipstick that I own from her and it is
in candy case mentioned this in my June
favorites video so of course I'm going
to be keeping this this is another one
from colour-pop in their ultra matte and
this one does the same thing as Chile
Chile like can you see how it separates
like that this one is in limbo which is
a brown color but I don't know something
about the formula of these two just
seems very very strange so this is what
limbo looks like it's a very very dark
brown and I don't know I can't does
anyone else have this happen with their
color pops does it mean they've gone bad
somehow i don't know i'm going to hold
on to it for now but i want to do some
more research into it because if it's
bad then i'm gonna have to throw it away
but this one is limbo from colour-pop
another one from droid cosmetics this
one is in 1995 again this was one in
collaboration with jaclyn hill now
Jacqueline held no longer does have a
collaboration with Gerard cosmetics all
of the lipsticks that she created I
believe are still for sale for them but
like she's not affiliated with them
anymore what happened and her story
behind it but honestly I was not
impressed with anything that she clapped
on them with them but ya know I couldn't
toss this another one of the Tarte
cosmetics TARDIS lip-paint and this one
is in TBT and it's a very like that cool
mom brown color and keep the
one and then from colour-pop another
ultra matte is in trap this one is like
that cool kind of grayish pink color
they really liked it so I will
definitely be keeping this one I wear
this one not so often is another soft
matte lip cream from NYX Cosmetics this
one is in realm this is a really pretty
like deeper red shade like almost like a
brick red brown red shade i would say
this one to me actually is not as good
as the other nyx soft matte lip creams
that i have i have to apply it quite a
few times and it's kind of streaky it's
the only soft matte lip cream that does
that to me which I find kind of strange
but still I really like the formula and
I do like this color when I want
something a little edgier so i'll be
keeping this one are so close to the
finish line i kinda can't believe it but
this is another Anastasio beverly hills
liquid lipstick and this one is in
ashton very cool like brownish orange
color it's like absolutely perfect for
the fall i loved it so much like the
minute i first put this on I was like
yes this is amazing so I will be keeping
this okay and then I have another of the
NYX soft matte lip creams i actually
just bought this on the other day as
well it's in san paolo they really
pretty like deep pink almost like a pink
fuchsia shade but i really like it so i
will be keeping this one's is a lipstick
from wet and wild and it is in bare it
all like two dollars or something like
that but i'm kind of almost like running
low on it but i'm going to keep it until
it's gone another Maybelline lipstick
this is mauve mania I wear this one so
much it's a really cool mauve color of
course and I'm going to keep it this is
another baby lips from Maybelline I'm
actually going to keep this one because
what is this shade this is in peaches
kiss but it really does not give like
much tint to the lips and I just think
it's very hydrating and like
moisturizing pillow lips this is
actually what I keep on my purse so like
what I'm out and about and I just need
to throw like some lip balm on this is
what I go for so yeah I think this is
the only baby lips that I'm keeping
these are my last lippies to go through
so another one from Kylie cosmetics this
is a lip gloss and so cute though I will
keep this one another one of the new
maybelline color jolts this one is
orange out first such a cool color and i
truly do love this formula love it does
my last one from Gerard cosmetics this
is in the shade buttercup honestly out
of all of them from dryer cosmetics I
really really did like the shade it's
another collab with jaclyn hill and i
thought this was the best formulated one
but again i just really don't stand
behind droid cosmetic so i am going to
get rid of it and i have plenty of other
nudes in my collection so i'm going to
toss this one another lip gloss from
Kylie cosmetics like i mentioned i did
get all three this one is in literally
this is one of my favorite shades it's a
bit of a deeper brown nude and i really
do like it again they are like hella
expensive but if you want something that
is not sticky like I just cannot stand
sticky lip glosses these are good ones
and the very last one has the honors of
going to anastasia beverly hills this is
in the shade Katherine again this is
another one that i just mentioned in my
most recent favorites video so of course
i'm going to keep it it's such a pretty
like brown berry color I just I
absolutely love it only keeping this one
and then we are done so this is the pile
of lipsticks that I'm keeping oh my word
and then this is the pile that I will
not be keeping so I don't know how well
I did I honestly thought I'd only get
rid of like to lipstick so I'm kind of
proud that there's you know probably
more than 10 in this pile but still
quite a bit here but these are just
lipsticks that I wear all the time some
of my favorite shades favorite formulas
