video is going to be my lipstick
collection declutter oh boy
so I did post another at lipstick
declutter mmm couple weeks ago maybe a
month or so ago and it was on like my
Reds and colorful lipsticks and then I
was gonna try to divide this one up as
well but honestly as I was pulling
things out and getting ready for it I
just got really overwhelmed because I
mean look at all these lipsticks it's
it's just overwhelming to me and I'm
running out of storage and all of that
fun stuff so I'm just gonna dive in
there's really gonna be no rhyme or
reason to those lipstick de-clutter so I
apologize that bothers you but me trying
to go through these and like kind of
organize them by shades and stuff I was
just getting anxious and annoyed and of
course areas is here with me ready for
this declutter just really wants you get
this cleaned up it's been a while since
I did my big lipstick declutter really
like who needs this many lipsticks
little ridiculous so if you want to see
a new declutter let's go ahead and get
started
so to show you an actual overview of
everything so kind of how I have it
stored like I like to store things by
brands and stuff so this whole thing
here is dose of colors like I have a
whole thing of NARS right here
this is a bunch of Urban Decay I did
take out a couple lipsticks that were in
my I tried to remove the lipsticks that
were in my red and colorful declutter
just not to have too much overlap and I
did also take out all of my glasses too
but in here I have a bunch of like NYX
and I have some other affordable like
elf and beauty bakeries in there but
then we have like Smashbox and Tarte so
I mean again this is where like I need
better organization I have a Big Mac
drawer right here I have more Mac I have
NARS in here more little NARS here as
well this one I have a bunch of
different ultra lipsticks I have a
little container here that has a bunch
of like NYX and I have some anastacio
here and then I have these two drawers I
just went ahead and check my camera off
the tripod to try to show you but like
in here so I have a bunch of like
colour-pop pure christina and cosmetics
the next drawer is my lip liners which
I'm going to leave alone for the time
being and
down here I have like milk makeup and I
have some higher-end stuff but this is
like Burberry and Marc Jacobs down there
and then in these little drawers I just
have like minis so like out little sizes
of lipsticks and then same for this
store as well it's just like little
stuff bite Beauty and things like that
and then in this drawer with all this
beauty and Kat Von D and some who
deliberately different Maybelline's more
Jordana but again like more tart and
stuff like that so hopefully after today
I'll be able to get it more organized I
like organizing by brands it just like
helps me remember where things are and
such but that's kind of like a little
overview of my collection and kind of
how I store them so let me put this back
on the tripod and really get started
ready I'm just gonna kind of go in like
the order that I have everything set out
here but first I have these a three here
from Revlon I just talked about these
recently they are the the plumping lip
cremes I tried out these three different
shades and I actually think I tried one
other one which is probably floating
around somewhere but I tried these out
and I do not like them at all I just put
him in a review and I was talking about
how much I did not like them they don't
do anything flattering for my lips the
shades are just like weird and chunky
and they don't apply smoothly at all so
I'm gonna go ahead and put those in the
past pile is always asked like what do
you do with the items that you declutter
basically it's kind of different per
categories but if I get something in PR
and I decided to clutter it I can give
it to like a friend or a family member
I'm especially when you're talking about
lipsticks especially like liquid
lipsticks that you can't really sanitize
I don't like to just give those to
anybody because I don't it just seems
like kind of weird if you know what I'm
saying if I purchased something myself
and it's in good condition and all of
that I might put it on my Poshmark but
again lipsticks are kind of like just a
little bit of a funky category to do
that in otherwise again I'll pass on to
friends family members you know things
like that I have a bunch of like YouTube
friends too that I
I sometimes send things along too I
don't think there's going to be anything
in here that's not open or not you
but in that case you can donate it I
donate to shelters and things like that
so you can do that but I'm pretty sure
everything in here is going to be open
to because of sanitary reasons usually
shelters do not allow used lipsticks no
matter what so that's just kind of a
thing though if something is really old
or almost gone you know I throw them
away but it's always very strange to me
when you do a declutter and people like
yell at you for throwing away lipsticks
and you're like dude I just gave my
niece 20 lipsticks like I'm not throwing
makeup away and they're just getting new
homes I just don't need all of this to
keep it moving so I have this little guy
here so this has my Urban Decay
lipsticks in it like I said I did take
out some that were in the previous
declutter I know I thought I like a lot
of these Urban Decay lipsticks actually
gonna go through and swatch some of
these and see what I think these are
just a few swatches here so starting
from the side we have Naked stark-naked
bun-bun which is what a collab with
Chris and Leanne and then we have but
that's first sin and then feel and feel
2.0 I know that I do not like this one
this is a first sin one is first sin and
it's a cream I don't know if you can
tell on camera there and I do have a
bunch of lights on but it has like a
like this weird kind of like shine to it
but it goes on the lips terribly like
it's very patchy and it's just not cute
and it kind of does what those red ones
do which was really surprising to me
when I put this on I don't know if it's
because it has a bit of a metallic to it
which it doesn't say that it does on
there it just says cream but I really
don't like that one I didn't think that
one was very flattering so I'm gonna put
that in my past aisle naked and stark
naked and bun bun I absolutely love
stark naked
the second swatch there is like my
perfect perfect nude at the moment but
naked and bun bun I really enjoyed these
too so I'm gonna go ahead and keep those
the last two swatches I have fuel and
fuel 2.0 fuel and fuel 2.0 are both
creams and uh I do like them and also
they're very very new to me so I'm gonna
go ahead and keep both of these because
they're newts that I love and they're
also brand new I think I've only worn
each one one time so I'm gonna put those
in my heat pile or more swatches up
there we have trip 1993 on Fuego and
then
talk backtalk is like one of my current
obsessions at the moment I love this
kind of like ma vie mmm it's beautiful
I'm definitely gonna keep that one 1993
is I think this was my first Urban Decay
lipstick I'm pretty sure it was it came
in like a set and it's kind of what
started my love affair with these I
definitely want to keep that one I love
that kind of like grungy brown color
it's the second one on top they're on
Fuego which is between backtalk in 1993
I just wore that one in a video the
other day and I got a lot of compliments
on it and then which one was this last
one it's called trip which is a comfort
mat which that might be my favorite
either the comfort mat or the creams but
I honestly think I prefer the comfort
mat from Urban Decay I just got this one
as well so I'm gonna go ahead and keep
it for the time being so I didn't do
great on the Urban Decay declutter which
honestly I didn't expect too because I
just freaking love those liquid
lipsticks but what can I say but next up
I want to work on this one here from
NARS this isn't all of my NARS lipsticks
but I have like two full sizes here and
then a bunch of minis over my full sizes
are in the audacious lipstick formula
and this one is Dale yes Dale and then
this one is Linda I'm gonna go ahead and
keep Dale and then pass on Linda there
are the swatches there
I like Dale it's kind of like that like
cool tone grayish color that I don't
have a ton of and I don't prefer Linda
on my lips kind of like orangie Brown
just isn't very flattering on my skin
tone so I'll go ahead and pass that one
on then I have these three minis here
from NARS so we have a D and then
Barbara and then Anna so these are what
those look like swatched Anna this last
one here is one of my favorites it
reminds me a lot of urban decay backtalk
but I think it has more purple in it but
one of my faves so I'm definitely gonna
be keeping Anna and then the other two
again this first one here in addi I just
don't think that's like a super
flattering color on my skintone it pulls
I feel like in the swatch and it might
be because of all of my lights but it
pulls a little bit more orange on me so
I don't prefer that one but Barbara I do
like as well but I feel like I also have
a lot of those shades and this isn't
necessarily my favorite favorite formula
I kind of
for the nars their liquid formats more
even though I do really like Anna but
out of these three I'm just gonna go
ahead and keep Anna last two from that
little section we have our Don and then
Jane and again these are the audacious
lipstick formulas so those are the two
swatches there and again it's like I
like them but I know that I have other
shades and other formulas that I prefer
and yeah I'm gonna go ahead and pass
these both on next up but this is my
drawer with my dose of colors liquid
lipsticks now a dose of colors has one
of my favorite liquid lipstick formulas
I've bought all of these and I love them
very much so in order here we have stone
and then lazy Daisy
mint tea which was a part of a limited
edition edition addiction collection the
addiction is real though and then we
have warm and fuzzy rosebud and then
let's cuddle so I did do the swatches on
my hand here so that's the same order
the first one stone is one of my like
hands-down favorite lipsticks this was
like a cult favorite I bought it because
everyone said I should and I loved it
and then next to it the warm and fuzzy
that's one of my favorites too and I
wanted to swatch those next to each
other
but you can see they're you know they're
different they're similar than different
mint tea I think is also really
beautiful as well especially for the
spring and then warm and fuzzy I like
that that one's just it a bit of a
deeper pink again this is one of my
favorite liquid lipstick formulas so
really not going to get rid of much
rosebud I think is really a cool cool
toned lipstick shade and I really do
enjoyed that one and I don't have a ton
like that the only one that I think that
I'm actually going to go ahead and pass
on you know I have some friends that I
could try to convince to enjoy dose of
colors and this is a let's cuddle this
was from a holiday collection and this
is just one of those nudes that just
doesn't look the best on me I don't
reach for them a lot and a lot of times
when I do I find myself putting like a
gloss over it so I just don't think it
looks great on me even though it's kind
of the color of my nail polish at the
moment but I think out of my dose of
colors I'm gonna go ahead and pass this
one on I'm gonna get a friend hooked on
dose of colors I can feel it and then
I'm gonna go ahead and keep these if I
want to focus on this big guy because I
know I have
Bunch in this particular container here
that I do want to declutter so here are
4 soft matte lip creams this is one of
my favorite formulas from NYX I highly
recommend these so we have Athens
Buenos Aires Abu Dhabi and then also
Cannes so there are the swatches there
so the second one which is a boy nose
areas that one was really hard to swatch
I believe that one is about empty so I'm
gonna go ahead and declare that one it
took me a lot just to get even that so I
think that one's about gone so I'll go
ahead and declutter that one Abu Dhabi I
just opened a brand new one because I
recently used my other one all the way
up and it's one of my favorite shades so
I'm good definitely going to keep Abu
Dhabi which is the third swatch there
and then Athens I don't feel like Athens
is one of my favorites
the first swatch I don't feel like
that's a favorite of mine so I'll go
ahead and declutter that one and then
the last one here I feel like I have
other shades like this this one is in
Cannes so I feel like I can get rid of
that so I'm gonna go ahead and declutter
these three from NYX and keep I would
Dobby also had in there this one is
London it still has the wrapping on it
so I don't know if I have a London in
here sneaking around in here or if I did
finally use up my other one in London
but I did already have a backup of it
because it's one of my favorite shades
so that's gonna go in the keep pile as
well and also in that bottom row this is
one of the NYX matte lipsticks and I
really don't like these so this is in
the shade shy and I I just don't like
these I don't like the formula on them
so I'm gonna go ahead and declutter that
one and then I also have in here this
one is from makeup geek which is an
indie brand and this one is in dainty
I do want to keep this around I do like
to support indie brands and it's a nice
nude shade so I am gonna go ahead and
keep this one in my collection but
working in the middle row I have four
more of these soft matte lip creams so
this first one here is London so I
thought that I did still have London and
then we also have Istanbul Berlin and
San Paulo so there's that first swatch
of London it's watched pretty well so I
think it still got some some luster in
it so I'm gonna go ahead and keep London
because clearly it's one of my favorites
and then Istanbul I'm going to go ahead
and
clutter because I I don't like something
that bright of pink so I'll pass that
one on it still seems to be in pretty
good shape
Berlin is kind of that deep brown just
not one of my favorites that I gravitate
towards so I'll go ahead and pass that
one on
but then San Paulo I really do like that
one I bought that off
it was either like a Jaclyn hill or
dusty Perkins recommendation so I'm
gonna go ahead and keep that so I'm
gonna keep - past - but I had three more
of these NYX matte lipsticks um I did
gets in a pretty big PR package from NYX
and that's where all these matte
lipsticks came from so some of them I'll
go through if I haven't even used them
at all you know then I could gift them
and like I send out like subscriber
packages quite a bit I'm just you know
for people that I you know see
commenting a lot and things like that I
try to send out two packages a month so
if something has not been used even if
I've opened it you know I'll make sure
to say that but as long it's if it's not
used or swatched I can still put that in
there so I'm gonna go ahead and put
these three in the past pile and then
the last one in that second row here is
this one from a sigma it is the in
spades power lipstick I really do like
this lipstick I wouldn't say it's like
an absolute favorite favorite of mine
but I still think it's a really nice
lipstick Oh yep I really like that shade
it's nice and creamy it's just a good
like regular lipstick so I'm gonna go
ahead and keep this one from Sigma and
then looking at the last row I see some
Anastasia and some huda beauty so these
two from Anastasia are her matte
lipsticks I did purchase both of these
and I don't like them I don't like the
matte lipstick formula from Anastasia
this one isn't buff and it's just it's
okay so even swatching like can you see
how hard it is for me to swatch that so
that one is buff that's the one that I
purchased second and then the first one
that I purchased is called dead roses
first I was like oh maybe I need
something more like of an actual nude
because this one kind of has that like
deeper pink vibe to it so that's why I
bought buff I just don't like the
formula on these they are not my
favorite so these I might go ahead and
put for sale since I did purchase them
but they're just not my favorite formula
man I don't like them so yeah those are
gonna go in the past pile but then we
have a bunch of hooda lipsticks here's
of the suta this is who - you're gonna
see there's more
we're around in this collection but
these are a bunch of my lipsticks from
huda beauty I'll go ahead and do some
swatches because they're all nudes
obviously but let's see how similar they
are okay so here are swatches of five of
my hooter lipsticks so starting on this
side we have crush and then sugar mama
and then wifey and then over here we
have bombshell and trendsetter
so bombshell and trendsetter were two of
the first ones I got and they were more
like of a brown nude lip kit that I got
and I think I'm actually gonna pass on
trendsetter
I really enjoyed bombshell just like it
was a little bit lighter and a little
bit more me but trendsetter is more of
like a deeper Brown and again like this
is one of my favorite formulas I can
hook somebody on this so that's what
I'll do with those two and then for the
three nudes these are the like newer
nudes to me in this collection but
honestly like I love all three of them
wifey I just put in my if I could only
keep one that's the third swatch there
crush is super light but it's like super
beautiful at the same time it's just
like so pretty and then sugar mama has a
little bit of pink to it but again
really pretty so I'm gonna keep out of
the five of these from hooda I'm gonna
go ahead and keep four and pass on one
then the final item that was in that one
is this one here from a CIA London this
is one of their liquid Velvets and this
is in bittersweet I really like this I
was actually kind of surprised that more
people don't chat about these okay so
there is the swatch of bittersweet if my
camera will focus hello there we go
there's this swatch of bittersweet I put
this one in a recent makeup tutorial and
I really like it it's kind of got that
grungy grey vibe to it but it's also a
really comfortable formula I like the
way it feels on the lips think it's
pretty good at being long-lasting so
yeah I want to go ahead and keep this
one I have some of these lip lingeries
in here which I do like this formula I
started purchasing this before I got the
PR package from NYX and I really do like
it
so we have dust till dawn bedtime flirt
ruffle trim and then also seduction so
those are the four right up here so
bedtime flirt and ruffle trim in the
middle those are the two that I
purchased myself that I really do quite
enjoy so I'm gonna go ahead and keep
those but I think the two on the end
I'll go ahead and declutter just because
I feel like I do have shades similar to
that and I'm trying to be as good as I
can with these so we're gonna go to and
to that round and then I also have these
three here so we have the shades exotic
and then Teddy and then beauty mark so
those are the three on the bottom there
I think I'll go ahead and declutter all
of those I do like the formula but it's
not one of like my absolute favorites
that I feel like I need to have a bunch
of my collection the two Browns here I
don't really wear that color a ton
anyways and then this color like I said
I feel like I probably have that one so
I'll go ahead and put all three of those
in the past pile and then I also do have
three liquid Suede's for this one as
well I have some other color colorful
ones that I that was in the other
declutter but on this one we have
sandstorm and then soft-spoken and then
tea and cookies so those are the three
swatches there I I really enjoy like
this is one of my favorite lipstick
formulas from NYX and I really enjoyed
these colors as well so I actually want
to go ahead and keep all three of these
because I prefer that formula and then I
have two here from ELF
and what's interesting is that they both
say that they are praline but they look
different so I want to swatch these and
see how similar they are so that had me
a little bit confused when I was pulling
these out so I was like why do they both
say praline and this one actually feels
it says lip lacquer on it but it it like
swatched like a gloss almost I don't
know that feels weird okay but then this
praline is newer in my collection and
this is a matte liquid lipstick so
that's pretty interesting I know the
matte liquid lipstick is a newer one to
elf so I don't know if maybe they just
like redid the formula but kept certain
names or whatnot but I can tell like I
like the matte liquid lipstick but I can
already tell like this is just kind of
like weird to me so I am gonna go ahead
and pass that one on and then actually
keep the liquid lipstick so also in here
I have this one from Beauty bakery this
is one of my newer lipsticks to me so
I'm going to keep this one it is in
Rosewood it's kind of like a darker nude
so I do want to keep that one this one
here from Smashbox is one of the
was on liquid lipsticks and stepping out
I do like this one like I like the
formula a lot but it's pretty much empty
so the last time I wore it I could
barely get any lipstick out and I don't
know why I didn't throw it away then
because I'm crazy but I am gonna go
ahead and just throw that one away
because it's pretty much gone and then
also in here I have this one from number
7 this is in honey bloom
it is a nice nude and I don't have a ton
of lipsticks from number 7 it's just a
really nice light nude so I'm gonna keep
that one because I don't have a bunch
from the brand and I like to have a
variety and then I have some here from
Tarte I know I have more of these as
well I really did enjoyed this
rainforest of the sea formula so this
one here is in rum punch which is one of
my all-time favorite nudes I actually
have a mini of this one as well that I
keep in my purse and I travel with a lot
so I do want to keep that one and then
this one is in escape but would this
probably could have been in my red
lipstick declutter so there is escape
that's a really mmm I feel like and you
know what because I like this formula so
much I'm gonna go ahead and keep it I
know I have similar colors to it but
again it's just a formula that I really
enjoy so I'm gonna go ahead and keep
those two from Tarte so we got this one
done and then these are from the Mac and
Petric star collection I know I'm pretty
sure I declutter the red one out of here
but let's see what these are so this one
is in she better work which is a nice
pink and then the other one in here is
called mama star and this one was deeper
I believe so actually out of these I'm
gonna go ahead and keep the pink one
because I would wear that more and I'll
go ahead and gift this one to someone
else except this one here from pixie I
mean I've been raving about this one a
ton this is in pastel petal it's one of
my favorites definitely going to be
keeping that one I have these two here
from Kat Von D I love this formula I
actually just picked up the new one the
studded kiss formula these are the
studded cremes and this is in Lolita and
Cathedral I think I wore both of these
in videos lately there is Lolita she is
beautiful and then the other one in a
Cathedral is just a bit
herb again I really enjoy the formulas
of those two top swatches there from a
Kat Von D so I do want to go ahead and
keep both of these I just picked up a
bow and arrow in the new formula and I'm
pretty excited about that this one here
from Lancome I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter it's one of their like juicy
matte shakers I liked it for awhile but
I just never reached for it anymore so
I'm gonna go ahead and put that in the
declutter pile and then I have some
lipsticks here from Laura Geller I
actually have not tried these yet so I
just got them pretty recently so I'm
gonna go ahead and keep those because I
still need to test them out I have some
minis in here these are from bite this
little shade here is in chutney and this
is a dual ended one and I think it's
pepper and fig that are on both sides I
really like these I wore them recently
so I do want to keep those then I have
some little ones here that I think are
both from Burberry yeah this one is in
nude and then this one is in russet so
nude is a really nice nude I was wearing
that one in a video recently as well so
I'm going to keep that one but this one
is one of those shades that like I just
don't wear a lot and I don't think I've
ever even touched this one so that could
be a nice one for a gift as well so I'm
gonna pass and also declutter and then
the last one in here is a from dose of
colors this is one of their like regular
lipstick formulas that I purchased from
Ulta and this is what the swatch of it
looks like this is called mocha you know
this is one that like I like it but I
just much prefer the dose of colors that
liquid lipstick formula like this one
just doesn't get me super hyped or
anything so I actually think I'm gonna
put this in my past pile I just I really
don't reach for at a time that since
purchasing it so kind of like why keep
it around so we got another bin done so
right off the bat these two are from
Maybelline and they are the super stay
matte ink I have the shades poet and
then also loyalists and I do have a red
one as well I'm gonna declutter these I
actually have them on my list to put in
my next makeup monthly in the fail
category they are way too sticky I
cannot make these work they get all over
my teeth these were just a no-go for me
so I'm gonna declutter both of those but
you don't spoiler alert you're gonna see
them again
this one here is from Sigma in new mod
one of my favorite pink nudes
of one of my favorite formulas I'm going
to go ahead and keep that one and then I
have some Oprah lipsticks here as well I
actually just watched these two kind of
pink ones in my PR products I would have
went that purchase with my own money so
I have unzipped and then also this one
is unzipped and this one is Manhattan so
I really do enjoy these I do want to
keep them over has one of my favorite
liquid lipstick formulas as well but we
have bel-air nude potion which was a
club with nikkietutorials and then
Manila and those are the three swatches
Manila is my jam it's one of my absolute
favorites I love it I actually really do
like nude potion it's really pale on me
but I really do like it
Belair just never really got my juices
flowing actually so I'm gonna keep two
and past one and have these two here
that we're in collaboration with JD
weighty and I like the nude but this
metallic one don't love so keep one pass
one so we got another one emptied out
these are the kc homes and Palladio
collaboration i know i'm gonna keep all
three of these because i just purchased
them just got them I've only worn each
one once so those three are all going to
stay with me okay these two from NARS I
actually really enjoy them both I was
just wearing American woman the other
day which is this one I think it's
beautiful and then the Freak I know I've
worn this month as well I really like
these these are called the power matte
lip pigments I highly recommend them I
believe they come in these sets like
this highly recommend going to keep both
of those okay so next up here let's
focus on these ones from NARS because I
feel like I don't need to keep all these
if this one I remember like something is
either wrong with the stopper or the
applicator or something is like messed
up here like look at that so that one
I'm just gonna put it in the declutter
pile because I remember that one like
it's already making a mess so something
is like defective with this one it is
called embrace moi so no I'm not going
to embrace you but this is how they
should actually look you know there's
the applicator you know everything like
that so not sure what was going on there
this one here in the shade under arrest
again it's like one of those like those
moods that have
orange to it that I don't love so I know
right away I'm gonna put that one in the
past pile this one is in Hell Gate I was
wearing this recently in one of my past
March musings video it's such a stunning
read it looks I feel like it looks
different on the lips then it's watches
but it's freakin beautiful probably
should have been in my red lipstick
declutter but I am gonna go ahead and
keep that one and then this final one
here is called summer fire so this one I
don't think I've worn this one yet let
me swatch it oh yeah that's a beautiful
pink like I said I do prefer these NARS
like any of their liquid products I kind
of prefer so yeah I might keep that one
too if I have these liquid lipsticks
from morphe I really do like the more
feel like with lipstick formula I don't
hear a lot of people talk about it but I
quite like it
so we have schoolgirl peanut and then
this was the collab with Orpha which is
in vinyl so those are the three swatches
right there I really like the pink and
then the one with Orpha is such a
beautiful look especially for fall I was
like addicted to wearing this in the
fall so I'm gonna keep those two and I'm
gonna pass along peanut it's just one of
those darker Browns that I don't wear a
ton of then finally from that drawer we
have some of the Mac retro matte liquid
lipsticks again I really do like this
Mac formula so the shades we have our
back in vogue you have burnt spice which
is one of my favorites cafe oh and then
this one is topped with brandy and the
last one is so me so I do have the
swatches on my hand here so like I said
burnt and spice which is the second one
that's one of my absolute favorites I
definitely want to keep that one and
then I think I'm gonna keep topped with
brandy which is the fourth one and then
I think that's it I think I'm just gonna
keep two and four nope and five I want
to keep five too which is so me I think
that color is really pretty and again I
do like this formula quite a bit so I'm
gonna keep three past two so next up
here I have my back lipsticks okay oh
boy
so let's see here this one is nice and
off colored I know this is velvet teddy
it's one of my favorites I'm gonna go
ahead and keep this so I'm not gonna
swatch all of these because that could
be like its own little video in itself
but just the ones that I'm unsure about
but stone derriere and stripped these
are all three of my favorite nude stones
a little bit darker but these are three
of my favorites so I'm gonna go ahead
and keep those three at twig babies all
right and then easy babe again some more
nudes that I love I'm gonna keep those
okay so the first three here isn't
unsure about we have a girl about town
really me and captive so those are the
first three I think out of these I'm
just gonna keep the center one captive
because I kind of like that cool tone
color and I really like matte lipsticks
they're one of my favorite formulas
before Shore so I'm going to keep that
Center one you clutter the other two and
then I have modesty and then also kind
of sexy so modesty and kind of sexy I'm
going to declutter both of these I don't
like creme Sheen's that formula of the
Makah lipsticks which is this one so I
know I want to declutter that one and
this is just a color that I don't wear a
ton of so I'll go ahead and declutter
those too I realize I should probably be
taking the caps of these because they
all look the same I apologize for that
okay so we have mayor candy yum-yum and
kinda sexy I really like these first two
here
kind of sexy I'm gonna swatch excite sir
I feel like I have plenty of shades like
that so I'll go ahead and declutter this
one I wanted to let you guys know this
is a big deal this is age sex location
I finally found her you guys this is one
of my favorite nudes it's been missing
in action for a while
I finally found it it was actually in
the back of this drawer vertical wise
like shoved in the back I'm thinking I
must have mixed it up with another
lipstick and I put it back there as like
one I don't wear a ton of and I put
another one towards the front oh my god
I was so mad when I found this last
night getting ready for this declutter
but clearly we're keeping age sex
location I'm gonna have to do a better
job figuring out where to put her this
one is playing coy which that one's
gonna be way too light for me so I'm
going to go ahead and pass that on the
luster lipsticks so this one is in a sea
shear I also don't like the luster
formula so I'm gonna declutter that one
float among the fireflies is another
cremesheen
I'm gonna declutter we have a creme Cup
which is another cremesheen so I'm going
to clutter that one this one is called
Yosh yes I don't really know how to say
that but that's a nice nude by
I'm pretty sure I have one very similar
to that in the urban decay formula hello
formula so I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter both of those film is one of
my favorite nudes I wear this one very
frequently so I'm gonna go ahead and
keep that one then the last two that I
have from that drawer are pink plaid and
also hmm and those are the last two
swatches on my hand right here so we
have pink plaid and then mm um again I
like these but I'm gonna keep mmm
because it's more of a nude and I'm
gonna go ahead and declutter pink plaid
Oh another drawer down so now I just
have these guys to get through your
cosmetics I have FBF and obey and there
they are swatched I'm actually gonna go
ahead and declutter these I've had them
for a really long time and they're just
not my favorite formula and I know I
kept some other ones from Pierre so I'm
gonna declutter both of those and then
from Christiana and cosmetics I have
three here Jade's our goals AF ternt and
then no filter so those are the swatches
here I thought this one was more of a
pinky nude but this one is actually a
deeper and it's almost kind of cool
toned so there's that one and then this
one is it turnt it has that orange vibe
to it but it's deeper more of like a
brown so I do like that one and this is
one of my only metallic lipsticks that I
ever keep it always seems to make it
through my lipstick to clutters so I do
like Christina in cosmetics in deep
brand that I do enjoy supporting so I'm
gonna go ahead and hang on to these
three already so we have a screen shot
instigator sundae and strip these two
are the ultra sentence and these two are
the ultra mattes and you know what I
think I'm gonna declutter the ultra
mattes they're not my favorite formula
so boom and then we have these left I
think I'm actually just going to keep
this last one here on the end which is
in strip just because you know this is
like one of like my favorite nudes so
that's what I'm gonna do there I'm gonna
go ahead and keep this one and declutter
another one so we have point zero which
was a collab with kathleenlights beeper
and then lovebug these two are brand new
to me they were just sent to me when I
did the campaign with Ulta and then I
love point zero those are the three
swatches there I mean zero
I love beeper I'm so happy to have a new
one and again I just got Love Bug in so
I'm gonna go ahead and keep these three
and the next drawer I have some here
from milk makeup these are their lip
colors I really do like them
so the first three
Swach here we have cream loki and then
wifey cream is one of my absolute
favorites and then I really do like Loki
so I'm going to keep that one and then
I'm gonna pass along wifey and then
these are some deeper colors we have
wavy girl and dip out I believe that one
is called so those are three right there
and I'm actually just gonna keep girl
out of these the center one because I
think that color is really beautiful so
I'm gonna keep one and pass on to button
here and this one here is from Burberry
this is really new to me so I'm gonna go
ahead and keep this one this is in the
shade bright plum so again just got that
one want to keep that one this is from a
makeup forever it's one of their liquid
lipsticks in 103 I actually don't really
like these I feel like I hear some good
things about them but they're just not a
favorite liquid lipstick formula I
really don't reach for this one anymore
so I'm gonna go ahead and declutter that
one and then next up I have a lip
contour lip color contour here from
Burberry I actually really do like these
and I think this is a really nice noon
is in the shade medium at number three
right there I'm gonna go ahead and hold
on to that one cuz I do like that one
and I do wear it quite a bit then I have
another one here from Burberry this one
is in a fawn this is a really beautiful
nude I definitely want to keep this one
and the last one in here is from Marc
Jacobs this is in a truther bear it's a
really nice like rosy pink shade and I
really enjoyed this formula of these are
the Lamarck liquid lip creams and I
really do like this formula so I want to
keep this one to be so next moving on to
some minis I just have some little mini
guys in here so this one from NARS it's
I buy a lot of like the Sephora
favorites or like Sephora collections so
that's why I have so many minis I really
like bound and I really like this
formula it's nice and comfortable so I'm
gonna keep that one I have another one
here from Marc Jacobs this one is in
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang this came in one of
my more recent Sephora favorite sets and
oh that what is so pretty
yep I love this formula to the Lamarck
lip creme i believe what these are
called
love it it's got to keep it this one
here is a TARDIS lip paint and honestly
i just really don't reach for the TARDIS
lip paints a whole ton i've declared the
others out of my collection so i'm going
to go ahead and declutter that mini this
is
from Kat Von D this is in Lovecraft
I get one of the aesthetic crumb
formulas I think this was my first one
and I just fell in love with the formula
I love the color I definitely want to
keep that one I have another one from
Marc Jacobs this one is in a slow burn
this was my first Marc Jacobs lip
product and what started the obsession
definitely gonna keep that one and then
this one here is from a makeup forever
this is in situ one one it's one of the
artists Rouge cremes and I actually
really do like this color I'll go ahead
and do a swatch here oh no okay I'm
gonna have to do something about that
but the color right here I think it's
really pretty and I do like to wear this
one quite a bit so I'm gonna go ahead
and keep that one so I have one from
Oprah cosmetics this is in mocha and
then I have this one here from Too Faced
and this is in Queen Bee I actually
really enjoy both of these so I do want
to keep those so looking at these three
that are from bite Beauty I realized I
have two of honeycomb so that's
interesting and then I have one in
brioche as well I am Oh am I gonna get
rid of this one yeah I'm gonna go ahead
and declare this one just because I just
I just don't reach for it a ton so I'll
go ahead and pass that one on and then
like I said for some reason I have two
of honeycombs I think they came in like
two different sets you know how you get
repeat shades a ton so I'll just go
ahead and keep one and pass one because
I obviously don't need them both and
they're both mini so yep they probably
just came in different sets so that's
pretty silly
and then the next drawer here this is
where I have Lollis Beauty I have Kat
Von D Jordana and then this one here is
from Tarte and this is one of the other
lip paints this is in collaboration with
bunny again I just don't love Tarte lip
paints as well go ahead and declutter
that one la vez beauty these are all
three newer shades to me and I love the
lawless Beauty formula so I'm definitely
going to be keeping these and then my
ones from Kat Von D so I have Ludwig bow
and arrow and then I have a minute
Ludwig as well which I don't mind cuz I
like to take this one traveling with
mean it fits in my clutch nicely but I'm
a big fan of the Kat Von D formulas if
you are not new to my channel you know
that so I'm gonna go ahead and keep
those this one from Sephora
I've been raving about recently
in shade 40 I believe it is pink tea
really loving these lip creams going to
be keeping that one I also have in here
oh here's another one from huda beauty
this one is in girlfriend
and yes definitely love this nude going
to keep it and then we have these two
from Jordana this one actually has not
even been opened yet so there's that and
then we have another one in buttercream
frosting
I actually do like these quite a bit for
drugstore they're not my absolute
favorite but I do like them I just got
this one so I'm gonna go ahead and keep
these too and then we just have one
final drawer left this is it for the
declutter so we have some tarts some
more Jordana like I said I do like this
one so this is in a tiramisu it might go
ahead and keep this one and then we have
some Maybelline and wet and wild to
finish it off well these two are from
Tarte the little one is rum punch what
came in a set and then this one is
called escape which is just a really
nice nude again just because this is one
of my favorite formulas I'm gonna go
ahead and keep both I know I have a
full-size of this too but again just
like with the Kat Von D I like to travel
with these and put them in my collection
so I'm gonna keep those and then I have
these ones here from Maybelline this one
is called born with it and this one is a
really really light pink like I think
it's almost just too good it's just
gonna be too light for me and it has a
bit of a sheen to it but it just doesn't
show up on me the best so I'll go ahead
and declutter that one next up here we
have truffle tease I mean you've seen
truffle tease a million times on my
channel obviously I'm keeping that one
dip and then this next one here is
called peach buff again from Maybelline
so this is another one that it just
doesn't look the best on me so I'm gonna
go ahead and put that one in my
declutter pile as well and then I have
this one is clay crush this is one of my
favorites as well I've talked about this
before in my channel I'm going to keep
that one and then this one is called
almond rose I was just wearing this one
the other day I mentioned it in a lip
pics video I'm gonna keep that one I do
like that one it reminds me of Mayer
from Mac this one is a Maybelline Color
Joel to one of their intense lip paints
and this is in a stripped down I've had
this one for a really long time and it's
actually almost gone so I don't really
reach for this one as much
more I typically go straight for my
liquid lipsticks but so I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter that one and then
the final one I have here this is a bear
doll from wet and wild I bought it from
a kathleenlights recommendation
it is incredibly old and it doesn't even
feel good on the lips anymore it's a
beautiful color
I would totally repurchase it and it's
only like 2 bucks but it's really old
I'm just gonna go ahead and toss that
one but after that that is the declutter
let me pull everything out and let's see
how we did
oh boy alright guys that is it for the
declutter so everything that is in a
little container is what I am keeping so
kind of this little section right here
there they are not organized I'll still
have to do that but it was just easier
for me to count and then everything that
is not in a container everything around
here that is everything that is being
declutter die hopefully had the
declutter calculator going while I was
doing this but out of a total of 184
lipsticks I am keeping 114 and I am
decluttering 70 I think that that's
pretty good I don't know the percentage
off the top of my head because math is
hard but I still feel like that's a
pretty good so that is going to be it
for today's declutter again this was
focusing on my pink nudes Brown
lipsticks over here I hope that you
enjoyed it I hope that you found the
swatches helpful and I just hope that it
was entertaining for you in some way I
feel a lot better I'm really excited to
now organize these containers I'm
excited to gift a bunch of these
lipsticks to friends and family members
and all of that but yeah I just feel a
lot better this is gonna be really good
for my collection so thank you guys so
much for watching this declutter my
foundation declutter is what it is what
will be next

be linked down below in case you are
curious but I hope you enjoyed seeing
