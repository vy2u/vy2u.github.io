today's video is going to be all about
some lipstick color dupes now if you've
been watching my channel for a while you
might be thinking girl when have you
ever done the dupes video okay and I
know I think I've only done one dupes
video on my channel and that was a
really long time ago when I thought you
had to do a dupes video if you had a
YouTube channel but I've been doing some
lipstick de clutters recently I'll link
my declutter playlist down below but
I've done a couple D clutters and I kept
finding myself saying in there oh I
think this is similar to this or this
looks similar to that and I kind of
almost just wanted it to be kind of a
personal challenge to see what I could
find in my collection that was actually
do pible this is going to be just colors
I'm not gonna be focusing on formulas
some color dupes I have are gonna be a
matte lipstick a creamy lipstick a
regular lipstick a liquid lipstick I was
just looking for color dupes in my
collection quite honestly I find it I
found it pretty challenging I thought I
was gonna have so many more and I only
have a handful here to show you those
are interested in this kind of video and
you could want me to keep hunting
through my collection and seeing what
other dupes I can find let me know but
why don't we just go ahead and jump into
it majority of the lipsticks are going
to be nude brown nudes pinks pink nudes
all of that that is the majority of my
lipstick collection and it's also the
most frequented lip color that I wear
but if you guys want to see another
video on this I thought I could do some
of my colorful colors as well colorful
colors and also maybe even some of my
lip glosses too the first color that I
was really interested in seeing if I had
anything do pible to it was
my Mac age sex location this is one of
my all-time favorite nudes I love it so
much and I was like what else could be
in my collection that I think would be a
dupe I am gonna do some swatches on my
hand but also insert close-ups as well
so for the Mac age sex location this is
one of their matte lipsticks and these
retail retail for 1850 so there's a
swatch of age sex location and what I
thought was really similar and that kind
of threw me off I wasn't expecting this
to be such a close dupe but it is from
Kat Von D and this is one of her let me
say correctly study
creme lipsticks and this is in
bow-and-arrow this is one of my recent
purchases from the Sephora vib sale this
is also a regular bullet lipstick and it
is also more on the matte side but I was
really surprised when i swatched them to
see how Sam look at that I would I
honestly was kind of surprised because
I've worn a Chuck's location in time
again I just got bow and arrow I've
probably only worn it twice but I was
not expecting it to be so close I will
say age sex location pulls a little bit
just a little bit more on the creamier
side but like by a pinch wear bow and
arrow I feel like is a very true true
Matt you can tell once watching them or
applying them to your lips the bow and
arrow is a little bit more on the matte
side but I was really surprised at how
close and Colour these were I really was
now the bow and arrow lipsticks are $19
so really you know a lot of time people
are saying dupes they're finding cheaper
alternatives to that I definitely have
some of those in there but again I'm
focusing on color dupes I'm not really
focusing on price and again I'm not
focusing on formula I was simply trying
to find color dupes because I have such
a large nude lipstick collection I
wanted to see you know how we say it's
similar but different I wanted to see
how similar I could find some of these
products you know but another one that
this is a liquid lipstick but when I was
looking at these two I was like you know
I feel like I have something kind of
similar to that and that is a NYX liquid
suede and this one is in sandstorm now
these retail for about $6.99 you can
find my drugstores so the prices can
kind of vary but I felt like this color
was very very similar so if you're more
of a liquid lipstick fan or again you're
just trying to find a price dupe you
know seven dollars is a lot more
affordable than the 1850 or the nineteen
dollars but there is the spa of
sandstorm again I've just applied this
so keep that in mind that it's gonna dry
down a little bit but can't you tell
just right there
so that is so for it getting simpler to
bow and arrow and also H that's location
and again I was like oh my gosh I did it
wasn't until i swatched out both the
other two that I was like this I know I
have something like
this and I think I just wore sandstorm
fairly recently so popped into my head
but I thought that was pretty neat so I
have a lot of the hood of beauty liquid
lipsticks I really enjoyed them one of
my favorite formulas but it means that I
have a lot of them so I was really
trying to find color dupes and it
actually was a lot more challenging that
I thought it was but one here that I
have is girlfriend so the hood of beauty
liquid lipsticks these do run for twenty
dollars so they are pretty pricey
it's a swatch of what the hooda
girlfriend looks like and the color dupe
that I found for it is actually in NYX
this is a soft matte lip cream in London
so these soft matte lip creams you can
find them at drugstores again just like
the with the liquid suede but they
typically run for about 650 but I just
thought that these were really similar
in color I'm actually kind of running
low on London so it's a little it's a
little tough to swatch like these were
very very close in color
I think the hooded one is like ace image
darker and that also could be because
I'm almost out of this guy but I really
felt like they were very similar into
kind of that deeper Brown nude and again
this is a very big price difference
between the huda and the NYX soft matte
lip cream
honestly the NYX soft matte lip cream is
one of my favorite formulas from the
drugstore I recommended a ton I've
bought and re bought especially London
several several times I don't think that
there is long lasting as the hooda
lipsticks but they are extremely
comfortable and you know clearly very
affordable but again I thought these two
were just very similar in color so again
that is the huda beauty girlfriend
compared to the NYX soft matte lip cream
in London so one of my new favorite
formulas for liquid lipsticks at the
time being is from lawless Beauty I've
been really impressed with the lawless
Beauty lipsticks but these are $25
liquid lipsticks that is very very
pricey these are almost the highest
price lipsticks I have in my collection
and - Marc Jacobs beauty but I really
like this formula it's very long-lasting
it's very comfortable I like the way
that these smell but still $25 is a very
high price tag but I do have four of the
liquid lipsticks now and I really want
to try to find some more dupes in my
collection but this one here is in can
this is the liquid lipstick that I
picked up during the eiv sale again I
wanted a little discount on it because
again 25 dollars is extremely high for a
liquid lipstick so that is a swatch of
Cameron it's a very very light nude pink
but it's very very light on the lips I
actually kind of notice when I wear that
one I definitely want to wear a lip
liner or you know even put like a gloss
over it because it can get really light
on me and as I was thinking about that I
was like I know I've described another
lipstick in my collection that way but
what was it this is also why I wanted to
do it around declutter time because I
have a lot of those notes I could go
back into that video and kind of listen
to what I was saying and looking at the
swatches and such but the one that I
picked out from my collection is from
Jordana this is one of their sweet cream
matte liquid lip colors and this is in
buttercream frosting Jordana is not as
easily accessible to find you can find
them at some drugstores I found mine at
Walgreens and this was probably last
year or two years ago so they're a
little bit more challenging to find but
they are very inexpensive so here are
the swatches of these again I don't
think they're like exactly spot-on but
they were the closest ones that I could
find again it's probably a reason why I
don't do new videos I feel like people
want it to be 100% exact and even though
I feel like I have a fairly good
lipstick collection it's still
challenging to find those 100% color
dupes
but I felt like these were pretty darn
close and for the price difference I
thought that I would put it in here
but especially as they're drying I feel
like they're getting more similar
towards one another too
um so again this is Lois Cameron and
this one is Jordana buttercream frosting
I will say that I don't think Jordana
does last as long and I also don't think
it's as comfortable as Lawless these are
a little bit more drying but there's
also a very big price difference between
them so if you are someone who really
enjoys trying to find you know a
drugstore liquid lipstick you're really
interested in color dupes you know you
could check out the Jordana one in
comparison to the lawless Cameron so I'm
also really into mauve lips I have a lot
of moms in my collection and I was
surprised how difficult it was for me to
dupe a lot of these lipsticks I mean I
don't know it just surprised me
how hard it was I like I even have on
this is a two-faced lipstick and queen
bee and I thought for sure for sure I
would have somewhat of a color Duke but
I really didn't to this one which
surprised me and especially I was
watching them against these two that I'm
about to show I was like for sure but no
none at all the urban decay of backtalk
lipstick this has been one of my
favorite lipsticks recently I've been
wearing at a time I really enjoyed the
Urban Decay lipsticks this is a comfort
matte and comfort masks are one of my
favorites from them
so this was one like I was so bound and
determined I was like I have to have
something similar in my collection right
it was so challenging the Urban Decay
lipsticks are $18 and again I just the
comfort mattes they really are a comfort
mat there's what back tuck looks like I
think it's so beautiful
like I said I've just been wearing this
color a lot lately the one that I found
in my collection that was like the
closest that I could is another one from
Kat Von D and this is in lovecraft so
this is the studded kiss lipstick in
Lovecraft
this is a mini but again go full sizes
for one for nineteen so there's really
not much of a difference on price here
but it could be a thing where if you
want it back talk with your you have
this you have this you want it back talk
they're very similar in color and
they're also pretty darn similar and
formula as well so here are the swatches
of these two side-by-side I think back
tuck is just a little bit like deeper a
little bit more mathy if L say like
maybe like a rosy mob but I felt like
they were similar and again I think this
is the most similar color dupe that I
have in my collection to backtalk i
swatched so many colors next to this one
liquid lipsticks and regular lipstick so
like I was like what is coming I thought
this would be one of the easiest ones
for me to do in my collection quite
honestly and it was really one of the
most challenging ones so this is what I
could come up with afford the back top
and dupe which is Kat Von D love crack
like I said I think the formulas are
pretty similar on these they're both
more of a matte I think with the comfort
matte there there's just like a little
bit of a sheen there if you can see with
that one or the Kat Von D does dry it
almost you know very completely matte
but again they're both very very
comfortable on the lips I would
recommend both of these but do you need
both colors I don't know
I do but do you I know already I just
have a one more left to share for this
round because you guys wanna see more
videos from me but this again is another
MAC lipstick I must add Matt it isn't
that this is from a Mac and this is in
mayor I think that's how you pronounce
it but this again like I said this is
one of the matte lipsticks it from their
collection and the MAC lipsticks run for
18 at 50 so there is a spot of mayor
this one is kind of like a rosy pink I
would say and then the closest one that
I could find in my collection that I
felt was fairly close this is actually
from colour-pop this is one of their new
one of these called the luster lipsticks
they're the lux lip the lux lipsticks
yes
Lux lipsticks and this one is in still
crazy and this guy runs for $7 so I mean
I feel like that's a that's a pretty big
you know price difference here is the
swatches of Mac Mayer and then color pop
still crazy I feel like those two are
very very similar when i swatched them i
was like boom you did it you did it yeah
found a color do because like I said
it's just been very challenging to
actually find these colored oops
so I don't even I'm not even gonna feel
guilty anymore when I buy a lipstick and
I'm like it's similar to this but it's
different because I feel like I'm just
proving to myself this video it's
different but these are again the
swatches of Mac and colour-pop again
1852 compared to $7 that's a very big
price difference to me the MAC lipstick
is matte and it does again address on
pretty darn matte I feel like it's not
fully fully matte on the lips but it
gets there the colour-pop luxe lipsticks
are very strange to me I have actually
reviewed them and I've said that
something they're just different I tried
out three different ones and I felt like
each one had a bit of a different
formula this one is still crazy is
actually the one of my favorites I feel
like it's very comfortable I don't feel
like it looks very matte on the lips I
mean honestly I would say it's closer
and formula to the Mac then like the Mac
and Kat Von D that I've compared that
are both matte lipsticks and such I feel
like these are actually closer in
formula so I don't know I don't I
wouldn't think that like I wouldn't say
Mac Mayer is like the most recommended
MAC lipsticks I have a couple other ones
in my collection that I'm real
trying to find color dupes for I've had
people recommend mayor to me in my
comments or say that Mac mayor is one of
their most worn lipsticks so I thought I
would throw on this dupe because I feel
like this is a pretty good match but
after that that's gonna do it for my
lipstick color dudes okay so that's
gonna be everything for today's video
going over some lipstick color dupes
that I could find in my collection I'll
have each of these listed down below of
course but let me know what you thought
let me know which ones that you thought
were super similar maybe you were
surprised on let me know if some dupes
into your collection maybe it'll help me
go through my collection again like I
said if you want to see another video
like this I know I have more color dupes
in my collection it just was very this
video I've been working on for it's
probably been like three weeks now I
mean of course it's not been every
single day but it's been a lot of days
that I've been trying really hard to
find these color dupes and it's like you
can only swatch and look at so many
lipsticks before you start to kind of
lose it but definitely if you guys want
to see another one let me know if you
want to see some colorful lipsticks or
lip glosses if that would be helpful I
would be happy to do so but I don't do
dupes videos a lot on here and but I
thought it would be fun to kind of
challenge myself and like I said since
I've been doing that the clutter is just
kind of going through my collection and
seeing what actually is comparable to
one another so if you guys did enjoyed
this video I hope that you'll give it a
thumbs up I hope that you'll also
consider subscribing before you go and
I'll catch you guys in at tomorrow's
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
