today's video is going to be the start
of my lipstick declutter series so next
up in my declutter playlist I am back to
declutter my lipsticks and I definitely
do need some help in this category I'm
starting to run out of lipstick storage
which is a very very sad you guys have
seen that I am on vacation during this
time so as pre filling videos and I was
trying to think of what would be like I
had one more video I needed to do and I
was like oh I could do a declutter
because I don't need to be on camera so
I don't have to worry about doing my
makeup etc and then I was like oh but
the lipstick de clutters are coming up
but it's good motivation to get started
because I'm such a lip lover and I know
these two cleaners are gonna be
difficult for me I thought I would start
off easy and do a red lipstick declutter
I said something on I believe it was my
Instagram stories about doing the
lipstick declutter and most people said
they wanted to see it by colors so I
thought that I could do that but then I
realized I really don't have that many
red lipsticks and so I decided to add in
colorful shades as well so I have some
like purples and blues oranges things
like that so that's what we're gonna be
doing today and that's the pile that you
see in front of you this actually made
me realize like how few lipsticks are in
here it made me realize how big my
collection of like nudes and Pink's are
so that's gonna be interesting to come
that declutter time but I figure this is
a good start and it'll be something
that'll be good for pre filming and all
of that and a good way to get me into
the lipstick declutter so I will have my
declutter playlist linked down below of
course and yeah why don't we just go
ahead and jump into it so this is my
little collection of red lipstick so I
don't feel like this is terrible I mean
I feel like I'm pretty good at buying
the shades that I wear the most which is
not red so I don't feel like this is a
bad little collection here for red
lipsticks but I'm just going to go ahead
and start here from the end this first
one here is a from milk makeup of course
you know who is right next to me eagerly
awaiting this lipstick declutter and to
see which macca lipsticks I gift to her
I've had a little issue in the past with
my dog areas eating some Becca lipsticks
it's not a good day
but this
one here is from milk makeup it's just
called their lip colors and this is in
the shade oh gee red I do want to go
ahead and swatch everything just because
I feel like it'll help me get an idea of
what to declutter so there is
oh gee red so I really do like this a
formula for the milk lipsticks they were
sent to me in PR but I will say this is
not my favorite red when it comes to red
lipsticks I like like a true red and
this one is more like on the kind of
like pinky even Orange aside so areas
what do you think yeah well we'll go
ahead and put this one in the past pile
with my de clutters if something is
really old I'll throw it away if it was
given to me in PR I will pass along to
friends family or donate and if it is
something that I purchased myself and I
in good condition I might put it on my
Poshmark I might still decide to pass
along to friends family or donate but I
only throw something away if it's old
it's always very strange to me that's
like the number one comment on to
clutters is why are you throwing that
away and I'm like who's to clutter
videos have you ever watched the part
people are like I'm just throwing those
in the trash because I don't see those
so that's weird to me have this one here
from NARS these are new lipsticks these
were actually just sent to me from it
NARS I have two of them this one is in
Cherry Bomb and it's called the lip
pigment and that is very very pigmented
I wasn't quite expecting that that's a
pretty cool color though and it looks
more of like my red tone you can tend to
see it compared to that milk one that
it's more of like the red that I prefer
I did just get these though so I am
gonna go ahead and hold on to that for
right now and then the other one from
NARS that they sent over this one is
called don't stop so there's what the
packaging looks like and then I just go
ahead and swatch this one as well so
that one is actually even like a juicier
red I think I might even like that more
than the first one but because I did
just get these I haven't reviewed them
or I don't even think I've actually
likes watching them for photos or
anything but but I do want it to put
that one in my keep pile so coming back
into here I have this one from Mac this
was in collaboration with Patrick Starr
this is in a Patrick will there is the
swatch of that one and this is another
one where it's just it's not my favorite
red like I have a particular red
lipstick that I enjoy the most and this
one just this one just isn't it for me
so I think I'm gonna go ahead based on
shade I'm gonna go ahead and put that
in my path pile I have this one here
from colour-pop and I love Sarah II this
is one of my favorite red lipsticks one
of my absolute favorites I'll go ahead
and do a swatch of it there is a swatch
of the color pop and I love Sarah II I
love the shade I think it's gorgeous it
is an ultra matte lipstick which isn't
my favorite formula from colour-pop but
I feel like they last a really long time
and again like I just love that red I
think it is so flattering definitely
will be keeping this one next up here I
have another one from Mac this is one of
their retro matte lipsticks this one is
called fashion legacy and I actually
really do like this one as well so this
one here is a fashion legacy and I
actually really do like this one I quite
like the Mac retro matte lipsticks I
don't feel like their look the longest
wearing a liquid lipstick ever but
they're really easy to reapply and I
like so many of the shades and I just
like how they look I like the
applicators I really do like this color
I get a lot of compliments when I wear
it I feel like this was one of my first
like when I really started wearing a lot
of red lips on YouTube this is one of
the first ones and I always got so many
nice compliments on it so I'm gonna go
ahead and keep that one this one to me
is also a new one this is from
Maybelline one of these super stay matte
pink lipsticks I also just picked up a
few other shades of this one too and
I've been trying out this formula cuz a
lot of people talk about it my swatches
are gonna start getting a little weird
here but that circle one there is the
Maybelline I wanted to try out this
formula I mentioned it and I think it
was like breaking down like gift card
amounts with high-end and drugstore and
I mentioned wanting to get this and a
lot of people said they thought that I
would like it
I believe this shade was actually sent
to me from a subscriber but it was like
I think I got her package the same day
that I purchased one at CVS as well
which was super funny but I do like up
the swatch of that and again I'm trying
to get a good handle like a good review
on these so I do want to go ahead and
keep this one except I have this one
from NYX this is one of the liquid suede
and I believe this one is in kitten
heels I think this is what it's called
yeah kitten heels I really enjoyed this
one I'm a big fan of the liquid suede
formula from NYX again swatches are
gonna be pretty interesting from here on
out but there is the swatch of kitten
heels and it's interesting swatched it
almost looks it almost looks like it
pulls a little bit more orange
to me but I know I've worn this several
times and I've always really liked this
red so huh that's kind of interesting I
do still think I want to keep it though
I know I've worn it fairly recently
again I really like the liquid suede to
formula it's one of my favorites so I'm
gonna go ahead and hang on to that what
okay I just took a minute to wipe off
those swatches and then I also realized
I had one in there that wasn't
necessarily a red so I took it out so if
you saw a disappearing lipstick that's
why but moving on I have this next one
here also from OOP I have this one from
Mac this is in Ruby woo which is a retro
matte I've actually not used this one
yet so there is a swatch of it I kind of
want to keep it just cuz I know this is
like a really popular MAC lipstick but
I'm like is that a good enough reason
I'm kind of looking over my pile but you
know I think I'm gonna do it I think I'm
gonna keep it
you know that's my lipstick the clutters
my lipstick the collection and honestly
I don't feel like I have that many Reds
I mean I feel like my collection is not
out of control so I don't feel bad I'm
gonna go ahead I'm gonna I'm gonna hold
on to that one
I feel good with that decision okay so
next up here I have this one from NYX
this is one of these soft matte lip
creams and this is in the shade
Amsterdam so this one I know has been
open for a very long time and I think
it's really kind of like running out
yeah I I feel like I can barely swatch
it because it's running out so I'm
actually I am just gonna go ahead and
toss this one because I know it's almost
gone so this one is being thrown away
but mostly just cuz it's almost out
anyways and it's I mean I know it's
running out but still that's more of
like a pinky read to me this one here is
from Oprah this is actually the last red
lipstick that I wore this is in Atlantic
City and I think this is a really really
beautiful red I really enjoyed the ofra
liquid lipstick formula I think it's
really nice and long-lasting and I do
really enjoy Atlantic City so I'm gonna
go ahead and hold on to this one so this
is what my before-and-after looks like
for my red lipsticks so I kept eight and
I declutter three I don't think that's
absolutely terrible and then I still was
the only one that I was unsure about
keeping list the Mac Ruby woo but I
don't have a lot of regular lipstick
Reds they're mostly liquid lipstick
formulas so and then the NARS ones are
kind of like in-between so I think
that's actually a good decision to keep
that one so
I'm gonna go ahead and hang on to that
but that is going to do it for my red
lipstick declutter and let me grab out
my colorful shades okay so here I have
my colorful lipstick collection again
nothing too crazy crazy I don't think oh
man this the nudes and pinks and browns
that's gonna be that's gonna be a
struggle okay so up first I have this
one from Givenchy this one is in the
shade Mandarin and it's a really cool
orange I was actually wearing this in a
past March Madness video and I think
just just in this little cool color I
reach for this when I want that like
cool orange color because I think it's
pretty sweet Jing is pretty neat on this
one too so I'm going to go ahead and
hang on to that one I still have this
one here from Mac this one is in the
shade lavender Jade so it's this purple
here and okay so I've never swatched
that one before either that's kind of
like a cool lilac II shade um I feel
like I might have something kind of
similar in my collection so I think for
right now I'm actually gonna put it in
the past pile like I feel like I have
quite a few purples so I think I'll be
okay putting that one in the past pile
this one is from Sigma this is in
foxglove this is such a cool color it's
like one of my favorite unique lipstick
colors it's described as a black berry
so there's a swatch of it there I think
it's really cool I like the Sigma liquid
lipstick formula so I am gonna hold on
to that one then I have this one here is
from Urban Decay this is in
collaboration with Kristin Leanne and it
is in cloud nine I have worn this purple
before and I thought it was pretty cool
they're so pigmented like that didn't
take anything to swatch super pigmented
and I think this is a really cool purple
I really like the Urban Decay lipsticks
so I am going to hang on to that one
this one here is from Kat Von D one of
the everlasting liquid lipsticks which I
really do like that formula and this one
is in the shade k-dubb that one I don't
even know how I describe that color it's
like a cross between pink and purple
it's kind of like a bright fuchsia maybe
I do like this formula but honestly I've
only reached for this one a couple of
times I just haven't worn it a ton and I
feel like I have some like different
other unique colors that I'd reach for
more so I think I'll be okay putting
this
in the past pile then I have some liquid
Suede's from nyx and is in sway this is
a really cool purple I've worn this in a
couple of videos and people always have
like some mixed reviews when you wear
shade like this but I think it's pretty
darn cool and when I want to step
outside my comfort zone I can reach
first way behind NYX and again I like
the liquid suede formula I'm gonna go
ahead and it was on to that one because
I think it's pretty neat this is another
one that gets pretty mixed feedback whoo
when I wear it another liquid suede and
this is in a stone Fox this one is just
a really I don't know how to describe
this color there is a swatch of that one
I do have to have my ring light on
because it is dark in my office but this
one is like a really cool kind of like
green grey it's just it's really unique
and again when I want to go outside my
comfort zone
I will reach for that one and I just
think it's a pretty cool color so I'm
going to go ahead and hang on to that
one as well again this one here is a NYX
soft matte lip cream this one is in the
shade Havana again I know that this one
has been opened for a while and soft
matte lip creams I don't feel like I
don't feel like they last forever like I
go through soft matte lip creams pretty
quickly but I also feel like maybe they
kind of dry out fast too so I know I'm
gonna go ahead and pass that one on also
because I think it's probably nearing
the end or I should just toss this one I
think it's nearing the end and it's been
open for quite some time and nothing
easy astute watch any more either
I feel like my camera is about to die
and we're almost losing the lighting
even though my ring light is on but I'm
like oh no but we are almost done and I
realized I had a pink in there that I
thought I got out of my collection but
apparently I didn't so again we have
another disappearing lipstick but then I
also realized I hadn't included my Fenty
because I just reviewed it in a video
that I shared recently so it's still in
a different pile this is one of the
amount Mosel lipsticks of from a fenty
beauty it's a really interesting kind of
like a peachy orange color I mean I feel
like this might even be like more like
nude ish but to me it's orange I don't
even feel like it swatches that orange
but on my lips it's a pretty orange
lipstick but I did just review this one
in a recent video and I said I wanted to
keep it because I don't have any of the
Fenty lipsticks and I don't have a lot
of colors like that which I still
believe to be the case so I'm going to
go ahead
hold on to that one I have this next one
here from Mac which is called
impassioned which is an amplified
lipstick again I haven't even swatch to
this one so let's go ahead and give it a
swatch and see what it's like okay so
that one is that's like an interesting
pinky with some coral too it's is kind
of a nice lipstick color I do like it
but I feel like I mean I haven't even
used it yet so I feel like that says
that says something so I'm gonna go
ahead and put that one in the past pile
up here someone can give it more love
than me this is another NYX soft matte
lip cream and this is in Morocco so let
me go ahead and see oh yeah I do I do
like this one but as i'm swatching it it
reminds me of this Yvonne she won and
this one actually seems to be in pretty
good shape I don't feel like this one
has been open for that long so this one
I could pass along to like a friend if
they would still want to try that one so
yeah I'm gonna put that one in the past
petal I feel like I have something
similar enough to it this next one is
another liquid suede from NYX and this
is a knit little denim dress this is
such a cool color I feel like the NYX
liquid suede lines like it just has cool
colors man like look at that look at
that that's pretty cool
that's pretty cool I definitely don't
have anything like that I do want to
keep it I do like this formula so I'm
gonna go ahead and hold onto that one
almost done this one here from Mac is
called a Vegas bolt so there is what
that one looks like go ahead oh this is
that's an interesting color it's a lot
more muted than I thought it was going
to be again this is one that I hadn't
used so I feel like I could make a
friend very happy and pass this one
along so that's a cool color but I also
feel like I feel like I'm okay putting
that one in the past panel as well so
let me go ahead and do that and then the
last one here is another one from Urban
Decay in collaboration with Kristin le
Ann this is in spellbound this is a
color that I haven't used yet I
gravitated more towards the other purple
this one is pretty dark but that is
really pretty
mmm I kind of struggling with this one I
don't feel like I have really liked that
door
work of a purple and because I know I
really do like this this lipstick
formula I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and
hold on to it I feel like I did a pretty
good job with my colorful lipsticks so
I'm gonna go ahead and keep this one
okay so here is an overview of my
colorful lipsticks so I kept eight and
decluttered six I don't feel like that's
bad that's almost 50% I do not feel like
that is bad at all I am pretty much very
pleased with that one so yeah that is
going to do it for the colorful lipstick
collection let me add in the Reds and I
want to see how I did with these two
categories okay so for today's declutter
I kept 16 between my red and colorful
lipsticks and then I declutter 9 over
there so I don't feel like that is too
bad and I am pretty happy with that so
that is going to do it before my
lipstick declutter for today sorry we
got kind of dark up end here but I am
I'm pretty happy about this will you
guys let me know in the comments what
you would want to see for like my nude
pink Brown collection because I know
it's gonna be fairly large do you just
want it broken down into different parts
would you want to see high end and then
affordable would you want to see a
liquid lipstick versus regular lipstick
do you just not care but let me know if
you have any suggestions there because
it's definitely gonna be a lot longer
video than this one so you'll have to
let me know what works best for you what
you would prefer to see but I'm glad
that I am able to kick off the lipstick
declutter I know that I should probably
do like lip glosses and things like that
too so we'll have a couple of videos in
here depending on feedback and stuff
like that but I'm excited I was able to
do this one and get it pre filmed for my
vacation so now I can just enjoy myself
while I'm in Arizona but if you guys
enjoyed this declutter I hope that you
will give it a thumbs up I hope that
you'll also consider subscribing before
you go and I'll catch you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
