every single week I should have known
something would happen because it let me
go live without saying that I'm not
gonna have problems and let my thumbnail
upload I think correctly without having
any problems clearly there had to be
some sort of issue and it was gonna be
that I was gonna be blurry the whole
time so Oh every week I don't know what
it is man I don't know what it is but hi
everybody happy Thursday how's it going
we'll try this again very usual um
so welcome to another live chat um
tonight's live chat is going to be an
anti howl I did my Twitter poll like I
normally do an anti howl won by like a
57% it seems like people really wanted
to see an anti hall and usually the
Twitter polls are really close to one
another like usually something wins out
but like 30-some percent but anti holic
really ran away with it so I don't
really do anti halls anymore on my
channel I mostly just do my will I buy
ads on Wednesdays and I feel like that's
pretty similar ish like similar style to
it and I don't know I just I don't know
if I love anti halls but like doing them
live I feel like it's fun that's kind of
what I think you know like I don't love
doing PR halls but I like doing them
live I think it's just like it's
different it's just a different vibe so
that's what we're gonna do today and
hello Katy yay hi everybody
I do apologize I just feel like I'm
having I feel like I'm having a rough
day
I've already ripped off my eyelashes so
I probably look a little crazy I did a
lip swatch video earlier for Instagram
so I now have like an exfoliating lip
scrub on and trying to help
after doing eight lip swatches hi Niki
just I'm so disturbed by what happened
today with the net neutrality I'm so
disturbed I can't
I'm getting so distracted every time I
try to sit down to like actually work I
just kept getting more and more
distracted by what happened today if you
guys do not know what net neutrality
you gotta look it up you gotta look it
up cuz we got to do something about this
I'm so disturbed so disturbed with what
happened today um but that's kind of why
I'm looking it's kind of why I'm looking
like a wreck right now but that's what
we gotta do um so yeah I apologize for
my parents but I will say to that I
really I really didn't do much research
on on the anti howl usually I would have
like a list put together let me see
variables in my chair remember ya see ya
okay mommy remember you can't win if
you're not gonna sit in the chair no you
can't whine
nope but yeah usually I would make a
list but I haven't even right like just
to just just you know like I was scared
about it and I was trying to do my best
to you know talk about it Oh
Aries is not hiding in the corner I was
trying to do my best to talk about it
and you know I was calling and sending
in the text and writing the letters and
doing all of that but I I really I
really really thought that it wouldn't
even pass this vote like I really
thought that so I'm just really
disturbed I'm just I'm just disturbed
and I watch the life Twitter feed of it
not just like this is disgusting but
anyways so we're gonna do an anti haul
but let me know what what are you guys
wondering if I'm gonna buy because I've
done a terrible job of getting ready for
tonight um I mean I will say I mean
should we just kick it off with Kylie's
rushes or nah does everybody you all
know what I have to say about that like
it's not like an obvious thing um I will
say that I get asked a lot still about
Kylie cosmetics and I just don't I just
don't really talk about her at all like
I don't put Kylie or Kim in my will i
buy it videos because
just don't support the brands either of
them but for Kylie cosmetics I was oh
wow I was really disturbed seeing that
and oh man I'm trying to think of like
everything that I should and wanted to
say on this topic but I kind of felt
like this was coming like I felt like
when wouldn't Kylie start at her
business and she saw that no matter what
it was that she put out that it was
gonna sell because of her name I felt
like I knew the moment was coming where
she was gonna do something big to try to
scam people like I felt I knew it was
coming and it's just so awful it's so
awful to see because to me it's like
then you have those other makeup brands
I feel like I'm like really short
because then you have like those other
makeup brands out there that are like
trying so hard and just trying to do
everything the right way in all of this
and then you just have a brand like that
it was just like yeah I can do whatever
I want screw the rest of you guys like
it's just that it's just sad to me and I
but I felt I really like I felt like
this time was coming and for brands who
I just don't like it the way that she
runs her brand at all and I have tried I
have tried Kylie cosmetics products and
I'm just disturbed at the lack of
customer service like cook no customer
service not at all because I've had
issues with my orders before and you
can't actually get help and if something
doesn't work for you you can't return it
like to have to have it be her and she
can't back her brand up even slightly
that's crazy to me like that's
absolutely crazy to me but no I don't I
don't ever like put Kylie and I will i
buy it video I would rather talk about
brands even if I'm not buying from them
I would rather talk about other brands
but it just is so disturbing to me and
someone told me the other day or the
other day it was yesterday someone on
snapchat
said that they heard that the the brush
set is almost sold out I'm like are you
serious are you serious really does
anybody actually know if that's true
because I don't even I don't even know I
haven't watched anybody's videos about
it you know what one thing that makes me
kind of mad I'm in a real I'm in a mood
tonight this is probably like the worst
day for me to do a live chat because I'm
so hey Liv I am so just like I'm so mad
today I'm so mad at so many people today
I'm so mad it's like the worst day to do
a live check I'm not usually mad I don't
usually get worked up but yeah what a
day
but it's really honestly making me kind
of upset and I'm sure people will have
their opinions on this too but I'm so
mad to see a lot of these big
influencers who have such a big voice
and so many people look up to them and
they are just firmly rooted with Kylie
and Kim and I'm like really this is what
we're doing there are so many brands out
there that would absolutely die
to have these influencers just mention
them once and they're boned with Kim and
Kylie I'm like cuz they need help really
cuz they need the help oh my gosh it
really does frustrate me it really
really does and now I'm seeing everybody
put out the videos about the brushes and
I won't watch them I don't care my
favorite influencers are putting out the
videos and talking about our freakin
concealers and brushes and whatever else
that she's really saying I'm like nope
I'm not even gonna view it I don't even
I really don't even care what you have
to say I don't know so does anybody know
can anybody tell me is anybody saying
that the brushes are good like doesn't
anybody know because like I said I will
not watch the videos I don't care I
don't care what they have to say because
I'm just I'm so frustrated about that
because like I said I just I feel like
so many people are looking up to these
influencers too and so for for them to
just be do it I'm like you like you
could do so many other good
things with your platform and with your
voices and that's what you're doing like
it just really bums me out so okay a lot
of you guys are saying that they don't
like them good like at least of my blog
my biggest my biggest hope and in all of
this is that they're saying no that
they're not good like that is just my
huge hope
Nicole concealer would give a good
review okay uh mom Samantha says I've
seen one that said they were all good I
almost got sick like ah that really well
there's a little hot it comes
um just you know it's just something
that makes me so it's just something
that really bothers me dang it I got it
I'm gonna try to be up in the comments
they hate when I have to like turn my
head so much um yeah I don't know that's
that's that's what I feel about the
whole situation I'm just getting so mad
every time I look at my subscription
feed and it's like all all Kylie cause
my legs I'm like can we talk about
something else okay is there any other
bread and the other product so they want
to talk about no okay nope oh man and uh
yeah when I did see the future when I
saw the picture for the first time of
the Kylie brushes I was like what
because they don't even they they don't
even look nice I probably have like
glitter falling all over my face
no I tried to do like a really nice
glitter liner today then I kept getting
so bad I kept having glitter all over my
face so a lot of you guys are saying to
watch Charles video okay maybe I'll do
that
maybe I'll do that um but I don't know
that's kind of what I think about Kylie
cosmetics and then like it camera -
scheana honestly makes me even angrier
like it makes me even angrier because I
I started following
I started following Kylie on like other
places like snapped and stuff and I used
to even like sometimes I would catch the
show like the Kardashian Joe Biden made
sure we are not watching it learn enough
it comes on in this household I turn it
to ESPN that's what I do um but I at
least knew that Kylie was into beauty
and such so I was like okay you know
maybe it makes sense and I really get
frustrated when people are like oh but
Kylie runs everything herself I'm like
okay um but I never really got the vibe
that Kim was like super into beauty or
anything so then when she came out with
the k'kaw Beauty I'm just like oh I
didn't even try I didn't even try at
least tried with Kylie it's like I
bought a couple of things and then
realized that that wasn't gonna happen
again but I won't even I won't even try
Kim Kardashian I just think we're all
scam just so that's what I think about
that um I've seen some questions about
the Mac and Patrick Starr and let's see
I don't I've seen a couple videos I've
watched desease video and I think maybe
Robbie to Christie I've seen both of
them too and I don't know if I will get
anything or not I feel like there's a
lot of items in there that just don't
totally speak to me or like I'm like I
don't feel like I need anything like
nothing is like getting me nothing's
making me feel clap you know like in
Wednesday's boil I buy a video like
nothing really made me like seal clap
like that so I laugh because they're
saying that yeah fairly plain I don't
know yeah that's kind of what I was
thinking - like just nothing really
caught my attention too much but for
some reason like this is setting powder
did why I don't know I have no idea but
I don't I definitely don't need one and
I barely even use setting powders
anymore especially right now because I'm
so dry so I'm like that would be
ridiculous
to get that but no and I am I'm fairly
ignored to watching Patrick Starr so you
know sometimes with collaborations like
you're really buying because you're like
oh I love that person or that
collaborator I'm fairly newer to
watching his videos too so I don't like
quite feel that pull yet um I mean I
don't like I have nothing against it at
all or anything like that but I just
don't feel like that yet like I would
with some other ones so I don't think
I'll buy I don't think I'll get anything
from that one either
um let's see I thought someone asked
about I think someone asked about Too
Faced but I wasn't sure okay someone
asked me so Georgia just asked about
cookin cosmetics someone asked me that
too I started in a comment in a will I
bite video and I was like oh I don't
know what that is so I looked it up but
it's like I drop my channel or something
but he did a cosmetics line is that a
real thing that's the front of this I
looked into it but it's real I wasn't
sure I didn't know if it was real or if
it was like a joke it is real okay um no
I haven't heard of him and I I didn't
know that adult I don't actually watch
drama channels I think I'm gonna film
they like what videos I watch what I
don't watch I think I'm gonna film that
for tomorrow um but I was gonna mention
on there that I don't watch the drama
channels welcome a lot of your his
announcement video is apparently really
funny okay um okay alright I will have
to see well look into that but no I so I
so I didn't know anything about that but
okay I guess it is a real thing I wasn't
sure I saw it and then I wasn't I wasn't
a hundred percent so that is interesting
maybe I will watch the announcement
video so that's funny um let's see what
else so two-faced I think someone was
asking about the the new eyeshadow
palette what's it called the chocolate
is it the chocolate bar palette
um I'm I decided I'm not gonna buy it I
decided that I'm gonna stay strong the
gold chocolate bar palette tropical yes
yes that's that's the one I decided I'm
not gonna buy it I I kind of considered
it did I put it in a will I bet video I
feel like I did and said maybe I was
like considering it and I've seen really
good reviews on I've seen really good
reviews I've seen really good tutorials
and all of that but I have so many
eyeshadow palettes right now I don't
know I like any more eyes should be
trying all these eyeshadow palettes and
I just filmed a shop hush hall that's
gonna go up on Saturday and I got like I
don't even know ten eyes shadow palettes
from a shop hush and I know a lot of
people are wanting to see some of those
videos and like comparison videos and
things like that so I need to be trying
those like it's crazy like it's it's so
it's I'm just really really overwhelmed
so I'm trying to do my best
and I feel like maybe if two-faced and I
hadn't been on this break I probably
would have bought it but since we've
been on a break for almost a full year
it's almost our anniversary or breakup
verse 3 what would you call that um but
I feel like it's I'm like it just stay
strong just keep staying strong but it
looks really nice and like I said I've
been seeing good reviews and people seem
to really be liking it I think I'm just
going to go ahead and stick with so
no I did film my best of beauty 2017
video today so that I think that's gonna
be Sunday's video so I'll talk about
favorite eyeshadow palettes and all of
that will be in that video so okay let's
see um the new NARS foundation um I
actually did get that sent to me in PR I
will have a first impression going up
tomorrow and also a giveaway because
they sent along samples of all of their
different shades so that video will be
going up tomorrow oh let's see Kristin
says do you ever get anxiety about not
being able to keep pace with trying all
of these new releases
yeah for sure I really do like not only
being able to keep up like just knowing
why is like keep up like ah um but
definitely keeping up just kind of
buying wise cuz it's just so interesting
like when I do well I buy a video and I
say I'm not gonna buy anything people
are like oh there she goes again not
buying anything I'm like what do you
expect from us I'm a real person
I write books for a living like that
sell for $2 on Amazon so I don't know
why I don't know where people think I
could buy everything in the world it's
just so interesting but then it's like
you feel that pressure because you get
comments like that and so you feel more
and more pressure to buy more and more
and then you buy more and more people
are like oh my gosh she's spending all
of her money on makeup she's so
irresponsible I'm like my head's gonna
explode I can't I don't know what to do
like it's so whoo you just no matter
what you do you're not gonna win and you
just you know I just have to accept that
but I just try to do my best in it what
I try to do buying wise is buy stuff
that I want to buy that I'm excited to
buy I'm kind of over the buying to
review it and like buying something and
having my review of like you know an
hour after I buy it type of thing I'm
just kind of like over that I would
rather people see what I'm actually
excited to spend my money on rather than
just buying to buy that's kind of like
the mindset that I'm trying to have
right now
so I'm just trying to do the best
section but yeah it's definitely it
definitely gives me a lot of anxiety and
then when you do get a bunch of things
and you're trying to release them
because I'll post a photo on Instagram
like hey I just got this palette and all
of the comments are it will where's your
review what do you think of it do you
like it should I buy it and I'm like I
just have I just found it what so
there's that okay um let's see what the
new Urban Decay all nighter concealer
yes I have I believe I have a review
video on that I think it was a follow-up
video I have a review for the concealer
on my channel and I actually really
liked it I feel like I even like it even
more than when I did review it it's so
good at hiding like blemishes um it just
it really makes the under eyes nice it's
just a touch too dry for me to say I
love it but I think it's really really
nice um okay we did talk about Too Faced
yes kathleenlights got my palette first
impression video is going up tomorrow
Lula Hendrickson banana cream I need to
check that out that sounds interesting I
love Will Anderson so much I went
through the other day and put a ton of
stuff from Willa Hendrickson on my wish
list like so much stuff it was kind of
ridiculous
um but yeah that's I would I'm not anti
a hauling back not until I don't know
what's banana cream is specifically but
it sounds fantastic
oh let's see okay um it's there's a lot
of comments coming in so I feel like I'm
not going to be in the comments quite as
much as I can be but I'm trying to see
as they come in so let's see what else
pink milk highlight yeah I just saw
something about that today
and that's I just saw a photo of it and
that was it so I'll have to look a
little bit into it I just off the top of
my head I'm going to say I don't need it
I have the milk holographic highlight
and I like that one and I just have a
violets anyways dose of colors new
palates I am planning on buying one of
them before my 20% coupon at Ulta runs
out I think I decided which one did I
say down berries I decided I'm gonna
just get one I put in the will I bite
video that I might get to I think I'm
just gonna get one whichever one looks a
less like the marvellous most palate I
care if everyone right now um I keep
seeing questions about the new Kat Von D
palate well I have Nicene about the new
cap what's the new Kat Von D Pelle I
can't keep up but uh I'm not sure about
the new kat von d palette cuz I'm oh the
mini metal bat oh no okay I have seen
that one oh my gosh I was like now which
one no okay so the mini metal matte when
I have seen that one I'm gonna I'm gonna
say no I must say no on that one I don't
feel like I would need it especially
because I do have the Saint in Saint and
sinner one and I feel like if I'm saying
this correctly I feel like it looked
like a almost like I'm I know it's
supposed to be like the mini metal crush
am I thinking of the right thing with
the eye shadows and the highlights
hopefully I'm thinking up the right
thing but again I just don't feel like I
need it I don't feel like I need it and
I really really like the Satan Center
eyeshadow palette like a lot with a lot
a lot a lot who need to keep drinking
I'm trying to do this thing where I'm
drinking a ton with water I feel like
I'm doing pretty good I fill this up
like 10 to 15 times a day so I I feel
like that's pretty solid cover FX
glitter glitter drops whoa okay
that changes everything Mady um glitter
drops I would probably say that I would
not need that and I mean I feel like
with glitter I feel like I'm pretty sad
between all my Stila glitters and Urban
Decay glitter liners I feel like I'm
pretty set on glitter so probably would
not need those I did see that the Marc
Jacobs coconut bronzer and some other
items is coming back too and if the big
bronzers coming back I'm getting that
because I think I put that in a makeup I
regret not buying video and I still
still want it let's see
new Sicily foundation oh I'm gonna laugh
when I see how much it's being sold for
oh boy I'm not familiar with Sicily
oh oh boy um Janelle says how does
everyone know about these things I feel
so out of the loop I know some of the
things being mentioned I'm like shoot
wait do I know about that one like my
brain can't handle my brain can't handle
all of it the new Fenty lipsticks I'm
actually I am considering I don't feel
like I've loved Oh Cicely has the
overhyped primer for $200 yes yes yes I
do I am familiar with that primer so how
much is the foundation do I even want to
know I would never be able to purchase
the $200 primer I just know I can't yeah
I'm scared like we're all scared we're
all scared tell us someone tell us no
I'm on the edge of my seat um 140 to 200
is the is that the foundation but the
Fendi lipsticks I am I considering I
think they're a regular lipstick if I'm
correct on that I wouldn't consider I'm
you know I like lip products and I like
trying lip products so I would I would
be interested in trying it and see what
I think of it um what else did I see
let's see um I did not get the the
morphe 39a or anything from the morphe
holiday it just to me it came out too
close to like the Jaclyn hill palette
and the three 502 and I had both those
so then when all the holiday was coming
out I was just like I feel like I just
am still getting to know these palettes
so I didn't purchase those it was just
it was just a little like too soon a
little too soon for me you know oh let's
see Oh more people are talking about the
little Henriksen banana cream who
someone said be safe Durga George I
don't know what you're
but you'd be safe you'd be safe uh uh
the comments are coming so fast the
Stila shimmer and glow liquid eye shadow
so those are the eye shadows that look
like the glitters but they oh you wrote
in the airport okay but uh but they
don't have glitter on their a regular
eye shadow I just I don't feel like I
would reach for them a lot so I don't
feel like it would be a good purchase
and like and their prep my guess is that
they're gonna be like the $24 or
whatever like the glitters maybe it'll
be a little bit cheaper if they're just
an eye shadow but for me when I make my
purchases if I'm gonna spend a little
bit more money I really tried to spend
it we've already talked about Kylie
brushes and I already got yelled at in
the comments that I talked about it too
long so if you watch it on the replay
it's the first thing we talked about so
you have 24 dollars for them you know if
I'm gonna spend like to me twenty four
dollars on one eyeshadow it's like I
just feel like that's so much and like
sometimes for the glitter I think like
okay you know it's glitter it's like
special and things like that but not for
just one eyeshadow I would rather buy a
palette and I just I don't think I would
reach out like I don't think I would
reach for that formula too much so mmm
no I'm not gonna buy those the morphe
lashes I don't think I'm gonna buy the
more few lashes um no I don't think I'm
going to I want to try I have my cart
ready to go cuz you know I'm a regular
person and I wait for payday like so
many of us do to purchase my makeup
purchases I pay my bills first and then
I wait for the rest of the paycheck to
come in and then I make my makeup
purchases that I want so um just the way
in is to get paid and then I'm going to
make a purchase from bold face makeup I
have like three or four different pairs
of lashes in my cart ready to go I
mention them in the aprons I want to try
in 2018 video and I went through the
other night and picked out a bunch of
lashes that I want to get so that is
what I'm going to buy four lashes next
and then I would like to try out the
Nakia joy that I just mentioned in the
will I buy it video to support it
influencer I think that would be pretty
cool
gerard cosmetics I actually don't
support the brand so the setting spray I
wouldn't get yeah so that's with lashes
so that's what I'm more interested in so
I just kind of wanted to be trying
different brands to you know I'm just
kind of like expanding and trying to be
able to like do my little part to talk
about other brands too because you know
you know I was up here in the beginning
of this video like you know big
influencers and we need to you know talk
about these four brands well like I have
to do my part to I can't say that I want
people to do that and I don't do that
that's not cool you know so that's what
I'm gonna purchase from next for my
lashes hopefully here soon so oh the new
Dior forever undercover foundation I
probably will not just because I got two
more I just got to do your foundations
fairly recently so I don't think I would
purchase that one cuz I haven't those
yes Jordan we talked about the new NARS
foundation I did get it and I will have
a first impression and giveaway video
tomorrow so check back in the morning
shoot I felt like there was another one
oh shoot you too

worked a lot in the book industry a lot
of like behind-the-scenes work - so um
see shoot um sorry I thought there was
another one that I was thinking about oh
the color green palette um I just oh I
just got a pellet actually um one of my
subscribers Maureen laughs sent me the
very cute palette oh I just posted about
it on my Instagram - um but she just
sent me one of the little mini palettes
and I was saying how I wanted them but
then this came with my fuel box I was
like no way so I'm so excited
hello Alex Cyr um so I'm really excited
so I have this so I think I just want to
try this out first and of course I'm I'm
gonna go into that purple shade like
real hard um so I want to try this first
and I know I think they have that the
bigger palette coming out I think I'm
just gonna go hard and try this first
and see what I think about it and then I
kind of go from there but I thought that
was so nice because this was even like
the one eye I said oh I wants a very
cute one I thought that was so cool so
yeah I'm gonna give that one a try first
before I start before I start going to
crazy
um areas excuse me is that your makeup
bag or yeah let's walk away she's in my
week of boxes she thinks everything is
hers like what what the heck um but yeah
so that's what I think about the color
grain we were yet 31 minutes okay
not too bad not too bad uh let's see
what else do we got oh she's she is
something well I felt like she ate
something funny the other day
mmm yeah remember let me see if they're
the comments if I missed anything I feel
like we feel like we went through a lot
um let's see a YSL new lip stain
probably not uh I've tried I'm fairly
sure I've tried a YSL lip color before
and I just didn't really love it and
especially for the price I kind of felt
like mm now so no to that one we touched
on the Too Faced chocolate gold a little
bit earlier I have not tried anything
from girl lactic no I have not
I'm open to it but I haven't tried
anything yet to myself um okay there's a
new Mario Badescu spray coming out
that's pretty cool oh the collab
yes-yes-yes Club okay so the new Mario
Badescu spray yeah I did see that one I
actually still have my original rose
water spray so I feel like I feel like I
don't need have a lot of sprays I
actually I I should probably go through
and declutter some of them because I
feel like it's getting a little a little
wild up in there so I'm gonna say no to
that one because I want to well I just I
want to get through some things I feel
like that would be good feel like I know
I have to film my project pan skincare
check-in video pretty soon not doing
great
um that sneak peek let's see oh collab
pull up pull up hello um so collab is I
watched Jen loves reviews video because
she had some sort of video on and I'm
pretty sure and it seemed a very
interesting like influencers had a lot
of say on this and so I thought that was
pretty cool and everything I'll have to
see we have a Sally it's
Beauty I know we have some I know we
have a store somewhere I will need to
find it but I would be interested in
trying it I think it's pretty I think it
like I would be interested in trying it
and seeing um I'm super curious about
everything behind it I think that's
really neat enough but yeah I know I
think I just saw um Lola or mrs. how
what does her channel name miss Lauren
yeah am I saying that correctly um I was
watching her snapchat tonight and I know
she got a bunch of the products so
hopefully she does a video soon I think
we'll watch that video too this is Lola
Linton there we go okay um miss Lola
Lynn okay
someone said mrs. someone said mixed but
you guys know who I'm talking about
I really like her videos too so I will
be checking that one out so feel like
I've talked so fast I like really I
can't even remember what all we talked
about now yeah look like comments were
coming in fast tonight guys um do I have
any spectrum brushes I do not have any
spectrum brushes we did talk about Mac
and Patrick start a little bit in the
beginning - um when I pop off the video
will be uploaded as a regular video and
I'll try to go through the best I can
and Link anything that we've talked
about as well I think I'm actually gonna
probably wrap up pretty soon I know it's
only about 35 minutes I'm usually on for
an hour but areas seems to be very upset
right now usually she's upset for a
while and then she'll go lie down but
she's she's still feeling upset I've
never tried Smith brushes but I would
like to I feel like I can really good
things about them I think they're a
little pricier I'm gonna say
but they look to be pretty interesting
so page doesn't etosha tarnishing the
shadows would you ever try them again I
think I would I bought one during the
vib sale but the palette came to me
broken so I returned it and then i
swatched some of the shadows in store
and I just wasn't blown away so I just
got my money back instead of buying a
new one but I probably what it's just so
expensive like sometimes it just
sometimes it just hurts you know it just
hurts that's all the new balm glitter
eyeliners I probably have to look at
them but I feel like I'm pretty faithful
to my Urban Decay glitter liner so I
don't know Mac and Jade Jaeger
McGirt Jagger Jade Jade Jacob Wow that
that's a tough name for me to say
tonight um I haven't seen anything in I
know I've seen about the collab but I
haven't seen specifics yet so I would
have to check that out but pax sure does
a lot of collaborations it's really hard
it's really hard to keep up with all of
them we talked about the kind of brushes
in the beginning first thing we chatted
about the benefit primer I actually
almost bought the mini the other day I I
really Oh Tim tell you did a review ok
I'll check out Tim tell ya um I almost I
almost bought the the mini primer and
I'm like I have so many primers like I
get like sometimes it's just that thing
where when I go to buy something isn't
you know you try to have that moment of
like do I need this like am I going to
use it more than once I don't know and I
can talk myself out of it I mean
sometimes they can't though sometimes
I'm so excited about something I'm like
I don't care I have all of those shades
still wanna try it you know I mean
everybody is so different in what makes
them what makes them tick and what makes
them be like but no this one yeah I mean
that's like me with nude lipsticks like
no this shade is different though okay
it's different yeah I mean everybody is
so different in their preferences but I
had that moment the other night I was
gonna buy the mini I was gonna at least
be good and not get the full size I was
gonna get the money but I was able to uh
snap myself part of it so uh yeah is
that all them did we make it I felt like
I felt like I can't I hold a lot a lot a
lot I'm just checking out the some of
the comments here so um I'm gonna wrap
that up before the anti halt but am i
selling a highlighter no bye no no no bi
is off I figured once I did my highlight
declutter I'll loosen the chains you
know I was like get yourself another
holiday treat yourself that's what I did
but I did want to say I am going it to
be moving the live chats here pretty
soon
today's the 14th so next Thursday will
be my final Thursday night a live stream
I did do a poll on my Twitter and the
most requested date to move it to was a
Monday I haven't done a poll yet of like
morning afternoon or evening but so I'll
do the live chat next Thursday at the
21st like normal and then the following
Monday is Christmas and I do celebrate
Christmas so I will not be doing any
live chats on Christmas I think we will
be traveling that day back home but the
following Monday I think I will do a
live stream and that is January 1st I
might just do a quick like really casual
live stream chatting about like goals
maybe or something like that like New
Year's resolutions slash goals and
things so that is the plan and going
forward but if you guys want to let me
know when the video does reupload as a
regular video if you want to come over
to it and
and just leave a comment and let me know
if you would prefer morning afternoon or
evening I've done four o'clock CST and
now I've done 7:30 CST so I don't know
if I should try to hit a different time
slot at all
but that's kind of I'm thinking and I
want to try to change the I want to try
to change the live chats every season I
think because that way you know I hit
more people because like a lot of people
tell me like a lot of you guys are
saying Thursday evenings work for you
but I also get a lot of Thursday
evenings don't work for me you know for
people who can't be here right now I get
comments later saying you know nights
don't work for me or Thursdays don't
work for me or will you move it to this
day so I know that it's physically
impossible to please everybody and
there's always going to be a day or time
that doesn't work for people but if I
switch it every four months or so
hopefully I'm being able to hit more
people that way so so there's that too
so that's kind of what I want to do and
why I want to uh switch it up every
couple months here to try to be able to
hit more people basically so that's all
yeah I think that's all I have to say
about that but also be here next
Thursday at 7:30 CST and then um we'll
make the change going forward from there
so the first highlighter to break the
know by I think was actually no I think
it was the wet and wild precious petals
highlight and then I did buy the Urban
Decay afterglow highlight palette yes so
yeah I got a couple new highlight
palettes in there so I did want to say
that and oh no also I haven't said I
haven't uh I know I haven't been in the
comments as much either but I know that
Katie my moderator has been in the
comments and she's been doing a
fantastic job so if you're still here in
the livestream you can click on Katie's
name and I'll take you to her channel I
hope you will sort subscribe and if you
watch on the replay I always have her
channel linked at the top I hope that
you will go over and subscribe to her
she is due with her baby so soon
which is so exciting um yes I'm sorry I
usually say that in the beginning and
then I felt like I felt like things were
just happening and I was talking about
net neutrality then I was talking about
Kylie and then things got really things
got real hectic real fast so so there's
that it does take me a little bit to
fill out the description box because I
watched the replay back and type
everything as I go along because
obviously like I didn't know what order
we were going in or anything so it does
take me a little bit to get the the
description box filled out especially
because you know now we're at 43 minutes
so be aware but yeah I think that's
going to be everything for tonight and
thank you guys for joining me I'm sorry
I'm looking crazy and I'm sorry that I
was on a heater at the beginning of the
video it's just been one of those days
you know it's just been a rough day
around here so and sometimes when I have
a rough day I do get a little feisty I
know I'm usually fairly calm in my
videos but it's because I'm usually a
pretty calm person but when things
really upset me I get really upset so I
mean life what do you do about it
but thank you guys so much for joining
me I always appreciate you guys so much
