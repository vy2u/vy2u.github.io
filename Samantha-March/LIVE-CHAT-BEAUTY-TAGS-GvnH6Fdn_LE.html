I'm late I was having tripod troubles
it's weird I use the same tripod every
week and every week I have trouble so
I'm like wow I'm putting you in the
exact same position it's very confusing
hi everybody how's it going hello
Melissa hello Cassie and Macey
how is it going everybody I'm gonna
attempt to find my live chat over here I
think area songs up let me see if I can
get area someone chair just come here no
chair chair I'm gonna fight no no no try
to give her her own chair so let's see
let me find my chat so I can look at
Aris I died in that put in the thumbnail
okay yeah coming up everybody everybody
everybody wants to see you this yep
come on so that they're here for ya I
know
they hide all your friends I know okay
you can't just lick my face the whole
time though who's there who she is
okay have you had enough you wanna help
okay hello everybody how's it going
so don't like the camera or my phone so
I asked on my Twitter poll like I every
week what you guys want to see and I
typically put PR Hall in there and then
either like a QA or a chit chat and then
I always have a third option and I
couldn't really decide what to do for
this week so I took some inspiration up
from my friend Jen from Jen loves her
reviews and in a couple of her live
streams she does like old-school Beauty
tags as what she typically has in her
title and I think that's so fun I love
watching them when I first started
youtube I definitely did a lot of like
tag videos because I was kind of like
what do you pose for content when you're
new so I put that
there is a third idea and that's what
one this week so I thought that was
super cool so oh man that's what we're
gonna do this week hello dee oh hi Amy
hi Carol hey that was a cool would be
what do you think you see all your
friends
they're here for you they're not here
for me I'm pretty sure people only
thought about snapchat to see you yeah
so that's what we're gonna do so I asked
on my snapchat what you would want to
see and people wanted to see the I think
it's called the I hurt fall tag so I
went and wrote down the questions for
that and then someone on snapchat wrote
in you can't get on the table she's
trying to get on the tape on the tape no
I won't do and then the other one
someone from snapchat sent in said they
wanted to see the seven deadly sins of
makeup so that is exactly what we were
going because she thinks that she should
be on the table she's confused with how
like how I'm talking at the table like
she's she's confused she wants to be on
the table
Julius those areas also play with makeup
- mm-hmm do you want to tell everybody
else what you did in case they don't
follow on snapchat
she ate like ten of my MAC lipsticks
yeah yeah yeah we found him just the
other night and it was devastating I was
like I can't believe it
and it won't really bummed me out is
that I was saving them for a giveaway so
that's that we still have some I think
maybe I might do like um like a 25k
giveaway on Instagram just something a
little smaller over there but I had a
big giveaway planned kind of like how I
did with the NYX one and yeah I may say
she'll be okay she didn't actually eat
much of the actual lipsticks like the
actual lipstick she just was chewing on
the tubes but
that was devastating and before we get
into the text i'ma let you guys know I
filmed a first impressions today and so
this video will be up it'll either be
tomorrow or it's really long so if I
can't get it edited for tonight it'll be
up for Saturday's video I'm changing up
my schedule for fall there will only be
a video either Friday or Saturday and
then I'll take one day off so earlier
than have it up Friday or Saturday but I
have the new NYX fire palette on my eyes
the $30 NYX palette so this is what it
looks like I've been trying to see all
day if it's like fading or anything like
that and then I have the fenty
foundation on I don't know um who else
has tried the Fendi foundation I got a
sample of it from my Sephora order and
I'm not sure it's a really full coverage
it's like real full coverage and I just
feel like it looks weird on my skin but
I've said I said in that first
impressions video that I try to give a
little update in this video and see how
it is so I put everything on at about
one o'clock and it's now 7:30 so I'm not
sure it is so ACS if I have dry skin I
don't really I have pretty normal skin
pretty normal I'm not very acne prone I
don't have a lot of redness I do I guess
I mean I didn't even notice if I have
dry patches on my nose but I must
because my nose looks scaly like it's
very strange and I mentioned it I could
see it immediately in the video I was
like what is wrong with my nose it has
like scales on it now so I must have dry
skin on my nose that's just never really
very noticeable so I don't know I'll
have to see of course I got a I got a
wear it for more than one day so I don't
know we'll see but yeah I try a lot of
new stuff in there and that'll be up
tomorrow or Saturday so oh and my
lipstick is the morphe and Orpha
collaboration in
I've been wearing it since 1:30 I ate
Chinese food for dinner I haven't
touched up at all and this is what it
looks like so I really like the morphe
liquid lipsticks they work out really
well for me so wanted to give that
update to you yes
so you know I know what's coming up and
let's see I don't even feel like my
foundation turned all that much darker
my I have to shade 210 on and like
people are telling me I would probably
be like 180 190 and they only had four
shades of sample shades to choose from
so I chose to ten and then I was like oh
my gosh that was so stupid like it's
gonna be so dark on you but it was
really not and I didn't feel like it
turned that dark on me like I watched
Jamie Genevieve and I thought hers
turned super dark and I mean I could
tell us a little dark but mmm I thought
it I thought it looked okay so uh so
there's that too let's see did see
what's everybody saying what's my Urban
Decay weightless skin shade I don't know
I have never haven't warned that one
right no I haven't tried that one I
haven't tried Mac foundation either way
to see like one else I could compare its
you to let you guys now like my other
normals
[Laughter]
so what tag do you guys want to see
first you want to see the fall favorites
tag or do you want to see seven deadly
skin deadly skins seven deadly sins of
makeup I screenshot it the questions on
my phone and then I was like oh yeah I'm
on my phone a tuba line so I wrote him
down okay everybody is saying fault
everybody's like okay cool so that's
what I'll do
so I'll could just kind of go like kind
of what Jen does it's like she goes
through the first question and she
answers and then kind of like side
comments and then we see what everybody
is saying so if that sounds cool then
that's what we're gonna do so I'm so
excited
Tech video these were always so
fine okay so the first question is
favorite fall lip products and favorite
fall and I have not I've been so busy
trying to get this video edited because
my my goal is to get it up tomorrow I
have not had any chance I just at like
7:15 was writing these questions down so
I have no idea of anything of what I'm
about to say but my favorite fall lip
product I mean I love liquid lipsticks
that's just what I go for I know a lot
of people are saying like look what
lipsticks are going out and lip glosses
are coming in and like regular lipsticks
are coming in and that's totally
fantastic but I still love liquid
lipsticks they're just they're just for
me
I just prefer them and I reach for them
the most and like shave like this is
what I will be wearing for fall hey
beauty I think next owner my friend alex
is here these types of shade are what I
love and again this is the morphe for
club I was want to say Oprah Orpha
collaboration in vinyl is what this
shade is it just released like last week
I think it is and they even say like
right on the thing it's like for 90's
girls and this is the total 90s shade
for me hey Jacqueline everybody this is
a total of 90 shade for me and like
that's what I love and I feel like
that's what I'm gonna love for fall it's
not quite red but it's like I always
describe it as like brick it reminded me
one of the very first liquid lipsticks I
got from colour-pop like when I started
buying a lot of liquid lipsticks I was
buying a lot of color pop because they
were only six dollars and this reminds
me of the shade bumble bumble bumble
maybe it was bumble I feel like now that
sounds wrong because anybody else know
what I'm saying now that I say it out
loud I'm like no that's not it I've been
thinking about it ever since I put this
on but that is the shade it reminded me
of and I was like obsessed with it so
these types of colors I feel like is
what I love for fall Bernie says 90s
colors are really in this fall Browns
brick-red
you pick you up deep plums bumble yes
okay most Sun is bumbled very cool okay
I was right shoe a reddish brown yeah
that's what I love
like that's what I'm thinking for fall
oh I'm just gonna read through some of
the comments here all Breanna's here
woohoo okay yeah so a lot of you guys
are saying Brit colors - yeah that's
that's what I'm diggin that's what I
mean that's what I'm really diggin for
fall so I am pumped Katie says you love
the rocks alter-ego and CEO for fall I
haven't tried anything from the alter
ego lore and I know it's on sale at Ulta
right now Shannon says I can't get away
from the nudes I know girl I would I did
my eyes today I was immediately like oh
you know doing something different what
the eye is definitely gonna put a nude
lipstick on and I was like no don't do
it don't do it
I've been trying to have you guys been
noticing in my videos I've had red I've
had like a purple like I've been trying
to get out there because people are
always like you know right now I'm like
why like we have comfort zones because
we like that like we like to step
outside sometimes but then we got our
comfort zone but I've been trying I've
been trying to mix it up Megan says I
want like a deep squash color is that a
thing I don't know what that's a thing
but I I enjoy that so let's see the
second question is favorite fall nail
polish well if you guys follow me on
snapchat it's like that never-ending
when I made the actually going to paint
her fingernails so that's hard to say uh
what I do I get asked a lot of questions
I do have acrylics these are not my real
nails these are acrylics and I have them
just put a clear tip on verses like that
white tip and I just haven't put a clear
gel polish on top and I paint my nails I
love nail polish I have so many nail
polishes I love painting my nails like I
love it and it's a few dollars cheaper I
think they charge like five extra four
or five less dollars to not paint my
nails and then I come home and paint my
nails but I get so busy that I can
my nails I think I went on Monday I got
my nails done and I'm still sitting here
like almost a my nails one of these days
I'm gonna do it the color I have picked
out next is all chopped up from Sally
Hansen like I at least picked my nail
color and it's kind of like a gray that
got a gray purple I would say so that's
what I have picked out but if I had to
pick a favorite called nail polish
probably like this I like shades like
this on my nails too so that would be
pretty Brittany says Miami fever is that
the one from KL polish from
kathleenlights I only have a one to four
nail polishes I had the one in
snickerdoodle I love that shade Carol
says I should do a nail polish
collection video still it did it one it
won the Twitter pulled at one time but
then I what happened oh I had to do like
an impromptu live at like 2:00 in the
afternoon for my friend's house because
we didn't have internet so that was
frustrating but yeah so so something
like this or maybe like a deep brown or
something I like those on my nails for
fall the third question is a favorite
Starbucks drink I think I'm about to
make everybody real mad of me
I don't like Starbucks alright see you
guys later
I'm going now I'll just I'll just let
myself out of all those limits I'll just
be over here don't worry I'm just gonna
let areas outside I really won't walk
away
Wall Street chance I'm just getting on
that I'm back areas was winding at the
doors I thought that would be the
perfect time to go let her out and then
she just stared at me I opened the door
and she was like what what are you doing
what are you doing me but I don't I
don't like staring I know I just made
everybody so bad uh it is it's expensive
I have a like little Keurig at my house
and but honestly the other reason is is
I'm not a big coffee person I don't
really enjoy the taste of coffee and
I've tried like some fancy things from
Starbucks that my friends have
recommended to me and each one tastes
like off to me the only thing that I
have found that I do like is just from
my local gas station it's called come
and go there in the Midwest and what's
it called a french vanilla charger so
it's basically a french vanilla and then
chargers because it has actually a few
minute
that's so typically what I drink and to
me that tastes nothing like coffee I get
to that has no coffee taste to it
whatsoever and I do like french vanilla
cappuccinos those are the K cups that I
have for my Keurig and Ares this is
gonna oh okay there's Ares likes coffee
too apparently that's their thing why
are you going down
younggu lead out it's cool that's cool
you got this you got this
people get mad at me when I put areas of
my thumb down and she doesn't come in so
you're welcome you're welcome if you're
watching so I don't really like
Starbucks on that much it's never it's
not really my thing it's not really for
me okay yeah
okay okay but yeah that's I don't really
I don't really like copy all that much
so let's see what you get they do your
thing that's overrated salted caramel
mocha that song I mean that actually
sounds pretty decent I know a lot of
people like pumpkin spice a lot of
people are sampling he's like I tried I
did try what was I gonna say
oh I did try a pumpkin spice latte or
whatever that was the one time and I
didn't love it it is telling me I have a
better internet connection so I'm so
sorry if it kicks me out because it does
this every time I feel like in every
live I get kicked out and I don't
understand because I feel like that
happens to nobody else
so that's frustrating let's see
chocolate chip rapid that actually
sounds really good mmm that sounds
delightful
someone says if you like hot chocolate
you have to try their salted caramel hot
chocolate I could do that the pumpkin
spice is nasty and I worked there she
don't tell anyone I said that that's
really funny that's awesome okay so
number four is favorite fall candle uh
I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you guys
nothing about me sometimes I like to say
that I feel like I'm really sometimes I
just don't feel super like girly or
feminine because I feel like so many of
my girlfriend's they get excited to like
decorate and like bake but really
decorating it's like really their big
thing and like the seasons changed and
next thing you know all of their houses
are completely decked out I don't even
put up a Christmas tree I don't put up
Christmas decorations I'm just I'm like
missing I'm missing that gene that's
like like I'm it's
not in me I don't know what happened and
it's like the same thing with candles
everyone's like God love candles and I'm
like oh and actually my husband just
asked me come back here
my husband just asked me the other day
he goes can we can we get some some
candles for fall do you think that
sounds ok and I was like oh it's coming
from coming from the back alright
done up you go she's struggling okay yep
come on let's go get on the chair really
yeah so Mitch asks if Mitch asked if I
could get us candles and I was like look
my dad said we get candles and I said
sure like why not oh boy
so sorry so I'm reading some cons so
Mitch asked if we could get some candles
and I was like oh I don't know I guess
sure but can you buy them cuz like I
don't really want to buy them so there's
that that's that's where I'm at my
husband asked for candles and I'm not
sure really how I feel about that
so I know everybody likes but Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond I just can't see I'm going to our
mall what gives me that our mall is just
huge I just I don't like it I don't like
it at all so there's that um this next
one it's that favorite fall scarf or
accessory and I was like isn't a scarf
and accessory I don't know
so a favorite fall accessory that
probably be like elephant boots in the
fall
that's probably yeah probably boots I
would
say I know again I know it all the girls
like to wear their scarves and I'm like
scars scars I think I have two scarves
and they were both as like part of a
free promotion I just telling you guys
I'm like missing something I'm missing
isn't that part of me so I would
probably say boots Brittany says boots
and a slouchy beanie yeah I do like
babies too I do like being is to my new
obsession all scarves and yes to boots I
was like 90 scars that's funny Allison
says I love writing boots but they don't
fit over my back ashna's booties yes I
do like booties - oh he's finally went
upstairs she was like I am over you guys
oh goodness I feel like Katie I feel
like you're on a roll tonight okay and
let's see so the next one is would you
rather choose a haunted house a haunted
hayride or a haunted corn maze up none
can I pick none a haunted house a
haunted hayride a haunted corn maze no
I'm out out I hate scary things I hate
scary things
yes no haunted I'm a chicken from Laurie
nonesense Melrose loved it Oh Lady you
said maze whoa that would scare me like
just not knowing which direction to go
like we have corn mazes here I'm in Iowa
so we have corn mazes
shocking but me and scary things like
give me so much anxiety and oh my gosh I
if I had to choose I'd probably go with
Amy I would punches hayride because I
don't know I guess I feel like hayride
you're like right there but I've been to
a haunted house we went to what's it
called the Hana sport haunted forest and
Ames in Ames Iowa and they had people
running around with chainsaws and like
I'm sure that it wasn't an actual
chainsaw like the blades
whatever wasn't in there you could hear
the noise of it and they were running
around and they were masked I just sat
down and cried like I was like I know
done I just sat down my friends were
like get up and I'm like go on without
me just leave me just leave me leave me
behind I can't take it anymore someone
says how do you feel about the new it
movie got a nightmare from the trailer
so that was great so that was a no for
me that was terrifying whoo whoo whoo
Brittany says we have a haunted old
prison here in the Chicagoland area nope
nope nope
we have like a haunted like would you
like a psychiatric hospital from like
way back in the day there's one I think
it's called independence Iowa it was
always on my way at like one of the
routes I would take from Des Moines back
to the buek when I was in college and I
would pass it and every time I pass it I
was just like oh I get so scared
Villisca okay I would actually probably
go to Villisca Villisca you guys you
gotta look it up you got a look that is
up you gotta look it up look it up the
Villisca ax Murder House got goosebumps
got these bunks right now guys that
those things intrigue me like just
thought the the haunted house isn't like
people trying to scare you and jump out
at you and like dress as a clown and and
all these things that part scares me but
the full list like things like Villisca
intrigues me
so Villisca is a town in Iowa I think
it's West I want to say and I can't
remember how many kids they had but it
was like a mom and dad their kids and
this was way back in the day and then
they had some other like neighbors over
at the house so there's a ton of kids
and someone came in overnight and axed
them all like they'd gone
they killed everyone and no one knows
who did
and huh who did it I read oh my gosh
every but so many things about it like I
was trying to figure it out
oh my gosh scared me they can do yes
people are saying overnight tours and
all these things and I'm like I couldn't
do an overnight tour but I would like to
go to just kind of like feel like the
energy around the house like but I would
try it I mean I'm I'm getting all hot
and bothered just thinking about it but
you guys have to google it you have to
look it up because it just I mean
obviously I can't tell the whole story
right now but it's freaky it's freaky
everything about it is just freaky yep
I'm having nightmares tonight this is
great like there are certain things that
I enjoy and like those like the real
stories are it I don't like just scary
things and things jumping out at me like
that's why I don't like haunted houses
like this like the ones that they do it
like Halloween and stuff I don't like
those oh you stayed a night at the
Lizzie Borden house you stayed the night
the whole night mind blown yeah Lizzie
Borden that also if you guess stuff if
you guys follow me on snapchat sue oh
man I had a rough night last week I came
home I was gone all day I'm into my
first college tailgate eight years out
of college I went to a college tailgate
for a football game I came home I was
like God let's work to do I for some
reason turned the TV on and I started
watching scandal made me famous
and then like copycat killers and I just
got sucked into the TV and I couldn't
stop watching and it was like
mind-blowing mind-blowing so that was
super funny but yeah I do I watch crime
shows sometimes I do I like to try to
figure out mysteries I read a lot of
thrillers I would love to write a
thriller but I get intrigued by like the
real-life mysteries I also get scared
but that's why I like things like it
like that just freaks me out on a
different level which is kind of weird
because I should probably be more scared
of real life
and not hey Michelle and not as weirded
out about I don't know that's just
that's just how I am so yeah you guys go
do it though look up Villisca ax Murder
House just look it up and then tell me

because we're always like the sore spots
on we just live it in like a little
cul-de-sac so there's only a few houses
and everybody goes like all out
decorating their houses for Christmas
and the Christmas lights and grabbing
the lights around their trees and we're
just dark it's not because I don't want
to it's because I just I just don't have
it in me I'd rather be doing something
else
Erica so do I hand out candy not usually
no not usually I buy candy but I I
didn't for myself so am i dressing up
for Halloween typically I do some
usually a friend host a party Francis
you're a busy woman I am like who I
don't I just but usually a friend has a
party and like we kind of go all out
together like one year we were all the
minions together one year we were all a
different form of social media and I was
YouTube so I had like a red tutu and
then I just wore a white shirt and we
like hot ironed or whatever the logos
and then I had a red bow in my hair and
that was it and we had like our friend
who was pregnant she was like really
pregnant at the time she was like the
What to Expect When You're Expecting so
I thought that was very funny
um so I don't know what we'll do this
year at last year we actually didn't do
anything because the clubs were in the
playoffs the playoffs so we didn't do
anything like you know we had such a we
have so many Cubs fans around here that
we went somewhere and watched the Cubs
game so that's what we did
so I don't know if we'll do anything
this year my husband is Sewickley always
gone on Halloween weekend so we don't
ever do anything like couple Eve couple
you eyes
I think I think Katie and I banned him
at the same time yes
Katie you on it she is all over like I
feel like I always talked to Katie who's
my moderator if you haven't subscribed
to her channel she has one if you click
on her name it should take you to her
channel but I always talked to her
afterwards and just like asked you know
how things would you don't say thank you
and I feel like we have nights where
she's like I was pretty calm pretty
chill and then there's other nights
where it was like oh my god like every
two minutes you feel like she's blocking
somebody so but thank you oh it's a big
thank you she gave me she helps me so
much so much um so I don't know yeah I
don't really ever do anything like
couple with Mitch because he's typically
always gone so I usually just do
something with my friends and I don't
know we kind of thought it being like
what weren't we gonna be this year we
were gonna be the characters from like
Mario Kart or something
I don't really know Mario Kart I don't
really I didn't never I never played
like video games so who I don't know
Mario Kart very well but I think I I was
gonna be Princess Peach I think I was
what she was called so you need to be a
princess but if we do anything for
Halloween Oh probably be that not sure
they'll probably depend on what the guys
are doing and then the tenth and final
question is your favorite thing about
fall whoa
I love the ball my huge NFL fan huge
Packer fans definitely I always get sad
when fall comes around because I love
the summer so much help I love summer so
much and fall means that winter is
coming so that makes me sad but I do
love hysteresis sadly I'm a very big
Niners fan I feel yeah
I feel yeah so yeah I love that
footballs back last Sunday was like the
best day ever had so much fun just
hanging out watching our football games
it was great I've never really had
baseball overlapped football so that was
really weird as a Cubs fan to have that
happen last year I feel like I missed
almost all of like the first half of
football season because I was still
watching the baseball games that's never
happened in my lifetime so um yeah go
back
somebody says where's Ares oh man you
missed her this will go up as a regular
video and just see she makes two
different appearances and she's all up
in my grill and now she's just staring
at me she's mad so that was everything
for the fall tag you guys want to do
these seven deadly sins we're at almost
40 minutes do you want to do seven
deadly sins or do you want to do that
another time
cuz I'm totally open to whatever you
guys want to do go Dallas Cowboys hey
I'm curious to see what Cowboys do I'm
always I'm always curious about those
Cowboys cuz I just feel like you never
know and we have a lot of cowboy friends
fans fans who are friends there we go
so oh you guys you know okay you guys
wanna do it okay we do so this is the
seven deadly sins of makeup here we go
so question number one is all about
greed what is your most expensive and
inexpensive beauty items my most
expensive anthony rizzo just got a hot
rod my most expensive beauty item what
would that be I feel like what I feel
like it has to be like an eyeshadow
palette right probably I don't know what
are your guys is most my wedding ring my
wedding ring is definitely my most
expensive um I'm trying to think most
expensive that I bought for myself
because I have a couple Kevin of Kwan
products and
know that those are expensive but those
were sent to me in PR a Sunday Riley I
haven't bought anything full-size Sunday
Riley of the power fabric foundation
from Armani
oh yeah that's gotta be expensive a lot
of you guys are saying Tom Ford
hourglass ambient lighting palette Visor
Oh Burberry yes I do have a couple
Burberry items now but again those were
those were sent to me to nataschab
Damona
yep what was I just thinking I feel like
I just bought something what is on my
mind I feel like I just bought a new
foundation and I said it was expensive
maybe I'm losing my mind maybe I didn't
see me says this have to be you bought
her on I'm not sure I don't know I was
just trying to think of the most
expensive things that I bought but it's
not coming to me so probably the most
expensive items are Mike heaven of Quon
that's all very expensive everything
everything and I just got a Yvonne she
foundation and that was pretty expensive
and then my most inexpensive beauty
product could it be like my ELF brushes
cuz when I was first starting out I
bought like the I think they're the
white handle elf brushes and they're a
dollar each like I feel like it doesn't
give any more inexpensive than a dollar
those were like some of my first brushes
that I bought
we're else and colour-pop I do I own a
lot of color pop and that's really
inexpensive - yeah one dollar brushes
yeah a lot of elf brushes yep you know
some wet and wild - oh my dad's like
there we go you know I love you guys are
saying elf yep for sure probably else so
question number two is wrath what
products do you have a love-hate
relationship with what products do I
have a love-hate relationship with
Brando's - the Kylie lip kit is that
your most expensive or your love-hate Oh
subculture yeah um subculture is a good
one
thanks kitty I don't know okay I don't
know how you black people so fast is
like I try and then my chat moves and
then I'm afraid I'm gonna block the
revoked person I'm afraid of like the
wrong one um oh no I can't get this
thing to go away
dang it a lot of you guys are saying a
subculture I was gonna say two-faced
that's trying to decide to face and I
feel like I have a love/hate with that
because I do love some of the items like
the chocolate Soleil bronzer I love it
but I feel so bad because because I
always like not that I talk crap about
Too Faced but a lot of you guys know but
you know super high on my list right now
and so then I feel bad using it and I
remember I posted a throwback video last
week on my Instagram like a throwback
makeup tutorial I do it almost every
Thursday and I am using the Soleil
bronzer and this is from like last
October or something the video is and
immediately someone was like I got you
know wedding to face you know like first
of all it's a throwback tutorial the
second of all I don't say that I don't
wear to face I just don't currently buy
from them that's all that's all I'm
saying
that's all I'm saying but chat is frozen
I can't see your comments no let me go
out and come back into my own chat cuz I
can't see your comments anymore iris
says I love and hate liquid lipsticks
hmm Sammy says the wide wild foundation
I like it but it smells like paint I get
that that is not that is not my favorite
anything color correcting is love hate
that's funny
I'm yeah I don't I can't color Craig
very well another Rose says the Becca
backlight primer it looks amazing
somedays others I look insane dude yeah
same thing man same thing
so you matte lipsticks that's funny
yeah my probably probably be too
FaceTime
no just because of just cause of brand
in general that's probably yeah so let's
see number three is gluttony what's your
most delicious beauty products I don't
really know what that meant
no what does that mean most delicious
beauty products
does anybody have a delicious B I could
yes right my newest I should delicious
I'm like yeah I don't know hmmm Michelle
says my beauty is edible my new
obsession my sugar lip scrub does the
peach who was that Elijah the other day
I think I was watching Kacie holds and
she was putting like a setting powder on
and it got in her mouth and she was like
what palette did I open the other day
and I was like all this palette always
smells so good
it wasn't it wasn't the sweet peach
palette I can't remember what it was but
I opened up the palette I was like yeah
that smells good ah the is it called the
boom-boom cream I've always wanted to
try that yeah I guess some of my lip
scrubs don't taste terrible
the tartlet palette oh that's when I
opened I opened the the Turk clay play
yes yes yes yes yes
it was the Tarte clay play it smells
good it really does that was such a
weird question so number four is sloths
the beauty product you neglect to use
because you're too lazy the beauty
products I'd like to use I'm too lazy
one for sure is an eyelash curler nude
I was like I freaking got an eyelash
curler because I thought everybody like
I just had to and they don't do anything
for me they do nothing this is why I use
eyelashes a lot of you guys are saying
primer I was totally that way like so
often I was totally that way with primer
and now I like now I just can't function
without prayer I don't know what
happened I always used to ski my primer
a lot of you guys are saying false
eyelashes I was like got the policies on
I just I don't know if you guys know
this about me I used to do pageants when
I was younger and I think that's what
started my obsession with lashes because
I would always wear lashes I've just
been obsessed with them ever since a lot
of you guys are saying contour so yeah I
would say I'm for shell false lashes
always result in tears and violence
Brittany says I got a heated eyelash
curler talk about stupid liquid liner
and false lash oh you guys are so funny
oh my gosh yeah so mine would definitely
be like eyelash curlers and color
correcting I can never remember it color
correcting Thursdays and I'm like oh
girl you need color corrected a and then
I don't do it a lot of times I forget to
do studying sprays for as much as I love
setting sprays like there's there'll be
times where I do my makeup and then it's
like 30 minutes later I'm like oh my
trying to spray my face sometimes I
forget I'm getting better at it but yeah
for me definitely eyelash curler and
color correcting I would say I don't
contour my nose I don't do that I can't
I'm not done with that yeah
um he says I forget primers that day
yeah that's so funny
yeah primers they're just hard to
remember man let's see number 5 is pride
what gives you the most self confidence
in your beauty routine my most self
confidence I always say that I can't
leave my house without eyeliner and some
concealer but probably first I would
pick eyeliner I feel like if I don't
have eyeliner on I just feel like I look
so young I feel like I look like I'm not
awake like my eyes aren't open I don't
know I just it's always eyeliner I
always have an eyeliner in my clutch in
my purse I always take eyeliner with me
a lot of you guys were saying brows
mascara and a lip concealer yeah so
first would be eyeliner and then second
would be concealer like I always just
need a little bit of concealer
underneath my eyes that just helped it
just really helps me out so much so much
so a lot of you guys are saying mascara
so Michelle says I do the best night I
think gosh I struggle I struggle man
I'll have because they're saying
lipstick as well
I love lipstick but a lot of times
that's like I don't know I feel like I
kind of forget about it I feel like I
look blurry I look blurry my phone see
what happens
I don't know that hey guys I'm back I'm
back sorry I was just getting ready to
pop in because usually when it kicks me
out it uh it lets me come right back in
and this time I didn't it took me to my
YouTube homepage I was like oh no it
really kicked me out but I should be
back sorry about that I know it's at my
phone I tried to make me not blurry and
it was like girl we're done with you
weird we are done with you sorry about
that guys that always happens to me it
always happens to me
so yes mine was eyeliner and concealer
and then just two more questions so
number six was lust what oh oh I don't
know if I realized that was this
question and I was writing them down
what attributes do you find most
attractive in the opposite sex what
attributes to if I'm the most attractive
in the opposite sex I mean definitely
humor like they have to be funny have to
make me laugh even though I don't think
I'm super funny but definitely like my
husband needs to make me laugh and I'm
trying to think like if there's like
something Michelle says guys that look
like much yes beards beards helped a lot
yeah I like I like to I like to laugh
and just cuz us men with dogs teeth
smile kindness good heart humor
intelligence humor respect I feel like a
lot of people are saying humor
intelligence I feel like just being a
like just being a good person like just
you know what I mean like someone who's
not going to be mean to you know the
waiter at the restaurant you know things
like that like things like that really
bother me so you know not
and just a good person to like me or
like family or whatever but good to like
other people I feel like that's
important makes me feel safe that's a
good one
Jackie darker mm-hmm I get that I get
that
Daffy says I have to admit I whistle is
but before we ever spoke are you talking
about your husband
that's really funny your case is good
people skills being good to animals
yeah Brittany sense good to service yeah
like just good to other people like not
not just you like he just puts it on for
you but yeah and I always loved like I
loved music and I love dancing and my
husband is like legit a jukebox like man
he just he I feel like he loves music as
much as I do and that's always really
fun like we definitely connect over
music like we go to a lot of concerts
together and things like that so that's
always that's always really awesome but
yeah I don't know if I have a lot of
like physical attributes I guess I don't
know I guess maybe I'm like trying to
think of like all of my ex-boyfriends
I've been information for 10 years but
I'm like trying to think like who died B
back then I feel like everybody had dark
hair so that's kind of funny hmm
Sammy says I've got no work done in like
an hour I may be fired but I can't stop
watching I hope you'll get fired Sammy
says music and concert goers a definite
must for me yeah and and like I need a
sports guy - because I love sports and
like if I were to sit down to watch
football all Sunday and my husband I was
like let's go garden I'd be like it's
Sunday well no no we're not gonna do
anything up we're gonna sit down we were
watching football and you're gonna like
it
like I wanted every game I don't just
watch the soccer games i watch all of
the games oh my husband he does have a
garden he actually does garden but if
you were to garden during Sunday the
ball I would feel real real concerned
with the state of my marriage
oh yeah
he doesn't pretty good garden he's done
it for like two or three years now he
always gets some good stuff out of it
like he just had jalapenos and there's
something the other day I don't need
jalapenos but I basically don't eat a
lot out of the garden but he does so I'm
like whatever do you think do you think
he Gardens he's such a he's so funny he
Gardens he doesn't woodworking oh I wish
I could show you guys what he made he
brought it up the other night to show me
he can he makes things out of a wood it
blows my mind it blows my whole mind but
he showed me the other day a couple
things that he made and they were super
cool but yeah and he also likes football
and baseball and soccer he watches a lot
of soccer he played soccer in college
and he likes music and he likes her
table so I feel like I found a good one
feel like I found a good one and it's
gun beard yeah I guess that's he should
have made a sound ring he should've he
finally got his replacement ring back in
guys
Mitch lost his his wedding ring in the
river last week or two weeks ago we went
floating but luckily there were only $40
off Etsy because he has a woodgrain ring
so it's actually like it has like wood
inside of it and then it has you know
some type of like protectiveness on the
outside but he loves woodworking like if
he could have his own like shop or
whatever I think he would totally do it
so I keep trying to tell him to like be
making things and I'm like just set up
an Etsy shop like people buy things like
that I've bought things like that like
we've bought things for much as parents
things like that and I'm like you could
make them it's so crazy but I don't know
maybe I could convince them to do it but
yeah I wish maybe if you guys are
following me on snapchat maybe I'll take
some photos and show you guys what he
can make cuz it's so cool
Danielle's my hubby is in law
enforcement but not handy at all like me

oh I can't do anything
playing jeez Louise okay so these
seventh and last question is Envy what
items would would you most like to
receive as a gift oh that's a good
question
what items would you most like to
receive as a gift I really enjoy
practical items like my mom our Mitch
and I just celebrated our first wedding
anniversary and my mom asked like what
do you want me to send you and we asked
for a pressure washer because we want to
work on our deck like our house needs
clean like you know like our siding and
stuff is dirty so a pressure washer like
and it's on its way to us so I'm very
excited like I like practical things
especially things that like I wouldn't
really by myself like I enjoyed those
types of things and like I love getting
like food gift cards I think those are
fantastic I know a lot of people are
like Oh Jeff cards aren't great I love
it
send me a food gift because I always
feel so guilty going out to eat or if
Mitch and I are ever like we don't
really do like date nights a lot because
we try really hard to like watch our
money and like we budget a lot and
things like that and we just don't have
like I just feel guilty going out to eat
and so if you have a gift card like it's
like okay I can go out to eat so like
those I think are awesome or I don't
know
we give card you know you might a lot of
things at Target but that's that's what
I want like I love practical practical
gifts like those are what make me the
most happy that make sense hopefully
that make sense
alive you guys are saying gift cards I
love you have cards like I've always
sent in everybody gift cards because I
think they're the best you know do what
you want to do what you forget what you
want to get with them Oh
Roomba yeah I would love a Roomba
really I feel oh man that would really
really help out gift cards are the gift
of shopping sorry I'm just reading
through some of the comments yeah I love
you guys you're saying gift cards too
yeah I think those are just so helpful
like I just just something just
something practical that I can really
you know put to use and things like that
but that's what I enjoy but after that
