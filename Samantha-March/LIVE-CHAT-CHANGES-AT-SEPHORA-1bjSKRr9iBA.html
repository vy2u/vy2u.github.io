grabbing a pin how is everybody doing
welcome to another Tuesday live chat I'm
kind of like all over the place because
I was trying to get ready for this
and I was trying to film a video and I
was storming and I lost Internet I lost
power I'm kind of all over the place so
today's video I took a Twitter poll um
when do I do my triple a glass Friday or
something
hi I did Twitter pull and what got voted
on that you guys wanted to see was uh
the changes at Sephora hi everybody hi
Mickey um so that's what we're going to
talk about hello hello Jess well hi um
so we're gonna talk about some changes
at Sephora can you guys see me okay cuz
I feel like I did something different
with my tripod and normally I feel like
you see a lot of my ceiling but I feel
like I'm really low now so let me know
if like my heads cut off or anything you
know just let me just just let me know
if I'm a little bit crazy okay Brooke so
I'm looking great thank you thank you
all thank you hello Cal how's it going
hello everybody
Thank You Jess okay good so whoo-hoo
okay so we wanted to talk about changes
at Sephora hello from Tulsa hello yeah
we were in like some crazy storms
I had actually - I had my ring light set
up and then I had a softbox that up when
I was trying to film this tutorial for
Instagram and hopefully it's not too
dark because I took him down cuz it was
I'm like sweating uh-huh and I was
filming my tutorial and then my power
went out so I lost my lights and I was
like well now I'm dumb I supposed to do
this is awkward so there's that hey
Michelle how's it going okay so we
wanted to bar changes at Sephora and now
they have a lot of different changes
going on so I guess I
kind of want to see what you guys want
to talk about first if you want to talk
about I know a lot of people are really
concerned about like their reward
program I know people are super
interested about color but it's a less
interesting and I know some people want
to talk about like their reports they
have like what do they call weekly Wow
so they're doing now so I mean I'll just
kind of open it up to you guys and see
what it is that you want to talk about
first and we can just kind of go through
there and I'm glad that hey Kati um I'm
glad that you guys want to talk about
this alive because I've been getting
requests to make a video like this but I
really wasn't sure how to make a video
because I have a lot of questions myself
you know so I would prefer to do a live
chat where we can kind of talk back and
forth and like throw out ideas and
suggestions and stuff because like I
don't know anything more than anybody
else kind of thinks I'm like a what kind
of how would I make a video like that so
I I'm actually really glad it got like
50 percent of the votes on Twitter so
I'm glad that we could talk about this
live someone's calling me it's so rude
who calls during a live chat know in New
York no no can I decline it okay sorry
New York hopefully I'll blow than
anybody important um but so yeah I don't
know because I'm kind of confused too so
someone said is it becoming Ulta I think
that was you Michele but seriously okay
so maybe we should talk about colour-pop
first I think that's what a lot of
people Jen beauty is coming yeah yeah so
okay um so colour-pop is going to be
sold at Sephora I did I watched I did
watched Lisa Stevens video actually just
this morning she works at Sephora and
she did a quick video about like the
reward point system program but I kind
of hope it does she have one about
colour-pop because if she does like I
would totally watch it because I just I
don't quite get it
I mean
am I glad about it sure cuz that's cool
but like why why Sephora
why is colour-pop not going in alta why
how is this working because they've said
that the prices aren't going to change
so so what what is sephora's plan like
has anybody seen has Sephora come out to
say anything like this is our plan going
forward because Sephora is always known
as that's where you go for the high-end
and then you can go to Ulta for the
drugstore and the high-end and then you
can go to the drugstore just for the
drugstore so what what the heck is
Sephora doing are they gonna bring in
more drugstore brands like are we gonna
be able to get Maybelline and Sephora
I'm baffled and I saw that they said
it's only I'm going to be like a holiday
release or something like not everything
of colour-pop is gonna be sold at
Sephora it's only going to be certain
items and whatnot but still yeah
Michelle said I wish I could get my
laptop to where I could read all of the
comments cuz I can only read three
comments at a time but you guys are
saying a lot of really good things
you think because altas getting a lot of
indie brands and Sephora is kind of
trying to keep up you guys have a lot of
good ideas here um they probably want to
bring in Millennials oh crap I missed it
how do I get this up on my laptop so I
can read the comments because I feel
like this chat is just gonna be super
interesting let me unplug my laptop okay
I'm gonna see if I can unplug my laptop
and find a way that I can follow along
with all of these comments because I
feel like it's just I just feel like
it's super interesting so I'm gonna see
if I can do this
because you guys have a lot of good
ideas that you're saying so yeah a lot a
competition Ulta versus Sephora and like
honestly I was super impressed with yes
I found it okay cool
so yes so some people are saying support
versus also and I was really impressed
with Alpha lately because there
more brands and a lot more of like the
indie brands so that's been super
interesting so is this supposed to be
like sephora's answer to it I don't know
the only thing that I feel like is
really bothering me with this is that I
just don't get oh thank you Mikey
oh thank you yeah I would love to get to
a job ut it's just probably not in my
cards anytime soon but that's okay um
but I just I'm just curious of Sephora's
game plan like I just I just wish they
would say something because I just I
don't know it's just strange so a
Sephora a way to test out the waters to
carry more affordable options and that
would be really interesting I I mean I'm
I'm totally not mad if Sephora is gonna
start bringing in more affordable brands
I just am curious hey Nicole oh my gosh
hi oh gosh hi look I'm wearing a t-shirt
like you but so I'm not mad I just don't
get it that's that's like my biggest
thing I just don't get it
so um okay so I can I was able to find
all your comments this is so cool I'm so
glad I have this so brooke says only
select locations and select exclusives
is what you heard it's interesting yeah
I know a lot of people are concerned I
mean colour-pop has said that they're
not gonna raise their prices but then I
just then I still just don't even get it
yeah so it's interesting so a lot of you
guys are talking too about the rewards
program so I think all those reward
program is so much better than Sephora's
like so much better so so I don't know
if it comes down to like where you're
gonna shop for rewards like I feel like
I'll just having so much more but then
at the same time I feel like Sephora is
now trying to match Ulta because now
they're coming out with these weekly
Wow's like last week they had a Tarte
tell it on sale for like half off they
had what else they have like a steel a
pallet for it for a half off and right
now they're having like you get four
times points if you're a Rouge number
and like three times points if you're
vib etc etc and it used to be really
people got so excited about the vib sale
that went on twice a year because
because that was really the only time
that Sephora was having like big sales
or big you know everyone's smile like
something would go and sale but it
wasn't like a big deal and that's why
everyone lost their mind over freaking
15% because we never got anything at
Sephora and now they're trying to do all
these different things so it's really
interesting because a lot of you are
saying you know it's it's the
competition and Sephora is realizing
that they're stepping up their game and
I think that's very interesting and you
know I'm I'm glad to see it I really am
because a lot of times yeah it's like
you go to shop at Sephora and I'm
someone who loves deals
I love coupons I love deals I want them
all and you can't get freaking anything
at Sephora and then you know their
reward point program really doesn't that
fantastic so it was kind of frustrating
for sure so I don't know Thank You Katie
thank you so much so I I think it's
interesting I'm not mad at it like I
keep saying I'm not mad at it at all I'm
not like oh my gosh it's not colour-pop
not affordable brains'll Sephora I'm
just really curious of boy they're going
that's that's all it is okay so let me
see what people are saying I'm so
excited that I can read these comments
no yes yes yeah Alta always has the the
20% off yeah they always have to 20% off
or like the five times points or things
like that and and that's awesome you
know oh my god you guys are gonna start
to make me cry so that's really awkward
when I live and I can't do anything
about that
ah thanks guys uh
I'm well thanks yes okay I so what some
people are saying I mentioned on my
snapchat yesterday I got invited to uh
to John Beauty New York like I got a
ticket offered to me but I can't go I
live in Iowa and basically to fly out of
Iowa the prices just friggin stupid
everywhere I mean it's just really hard
to fly out anywhere so unfortunately I
can't go and it's only um you know a
month away it's September 23rd and 24th
and it's just really really short notice
and you know not not only the flight but
you know just being there and eating and
you know hotel and you know all of that
stuff it's just it's just a lot and it's
just it's just not in my cards right now
but but it will be but it will be it
will be someday I know that I know that
I know that all gets one and I know a
lot of people really want me to go and I
really want to go and I think it would
be amazing but um but yeah I I feel very
special that I even got a freaking
invite I mean that's awesome and I know
not everybody does so you know I gotta I
gotta I gotta think of that you know I
gotta keep that in mind so but thank you
thank you guys thank you guys I
appreciate you so much like I appreciate
you guys so much you don't even know
okay Danielle says that you love the
five points on purchases yeah like that
helps so much
that's awesome cuz all the times they do
it by brands you know if you buy from
anastasiya you get the five times points
and you know I think that's just so cool
so that definitely helps and you know
what people I feel like really love
about Ulta
I just got a text message about an
appointment for my husband
that was weird um what I think people
like about Ulta is that you can use your
points for for money off and that's
awesome you know
so unlike Sephora you can only use it
for to to purchase products and a lot of
times it's like these little deluxe
sized samples that you're getting and
things like that it's like okay but Ulta
it's really nice because you can forget
whored your points and and then when you
go to purchase like there was one time
about a hundred bucks off like that's
crazy that's insane like that is so cool
and so I'm curious to see if Sephora
will do anything change wise like that
so to kind of make their reward point
better and so someone asked when I
mentioned about the rewards earlier
about about how they're changing so
basically from what I gathered and like
I said I watched Lisa Stevens video so
um when this video goes back up as a
regular video and I can put all my links
and and stuff I will link her video down
below but basically they're they're not
really doing much different from what I
understand it's just that their points
used to never expire and now they will
expire and it seems like people are
really upset about it but she explained
that they will only expire if you
haven't used your account at all in 18
months and by that it means buying
anything from Sephora um you know even
using your points like if you just want
to use your point on a deluxe sized
sample or whatnot that counts or like
how you get a free birthday gift every
year with Sephora now my husband's
calling me every Tuesday I'm live at 4
o'clock what what what why I love them
but sorry sorry much um
but or if you redeem your birthday gift
then your account is all in good
standing so okay
sorry I got kicked out I don't know why
I've only had 15 minutes it usually
doesn't kick me out till at least like
25 but I'm back if you guys can't see me
if you want to
come back in I think it's because my
phone I've now had two phone calls like
why so there's that so really I mean III
don't feel like I don't feel like that's
a bad thing for them to expire after 18
months because I mean 18 months to buy
something or redeem a free gift Society
I mean I mean I don't think a lot of
people will really be affected by that
so that's the change oh hi you're so
funny
you helped me how much is the airfare it
was around like three four hundred
dollars and then you know and then food
and hotel and all that like it would
just it would be an expensive trip I
know even if I only went out there for
like the two days but um you know and I
know because I said that to someone um I
was having a conversation with someone
one snap and they said that's not too
expensive but remember that everybody
has a different point of view of what's
expensive and just kind of you know I've
talked to my snap about how there are
some things going on in my personal life
and there's there's some things going on
that that aren't great and that are
costing money so good times good times
good times all around super fun um let's
see I love that I can read everybody's
comments why haven't I done this sooner
duh that's cuz I don't understand
livestreams like I still I've done like
what five or six of them now I still
couldn't even tell you where to find a
live stream like I'm like where you go
to my channel that's what you do okay so
what are you guys thing so yeah I'm very
I'm super curious if Sephora will change
it to something like that because
wouldn't it be so bombed to not freaking
close I said wouldn't it be so bottom if
you could hoard your Sephora points and
then get like 50 bucks off 80 bucks off
I mean I would not be mad at that
because typically with Safari you're
spending more money so there's that oh
let's see
what other brands would you guys want to
see come to Sephora like what affordable
brands would you want to see cuz that's
like we've been kind of like racking my
brain like what would I want to see at
Sephora like maybe one that's not in
Ulta already what would you guys want to
see let's see you yeah expensive this
different bourbon yeah yeah it is
hey Amy
Stephanie says I love your nails in your
books thank you I haven't painted my
nails Oh
Thank You Megan oh thank you thank you
thank you guys you're so sweet
morphe the bomb I thought I heard
somewhere that morphe was gonna be sold
in Sephora makeup geek that's not I
thought I heard morphe at Sephora and
then then what's color pop I was like
wow he's like a 100 lapidary Juvia
splays Sigma I would love to see I would
love to see Sigma so in neither Sephora
or all that I don't even care but I hit
Sephora or Sigma that's just one of my
faves I'd love to see that and let's see
elf
oh yeah Sigma is that new Nordstrom I
just realized that the other day we
don't have a Nordstrom here I know they
have online but I went shopping this was
a couple months ago I went looking for
like sunglasses and I was like oh we
don't actually have one here so bummer
whoops um Holly you mentioned off topic
what art has a great reward system they
really do because I've talked I know
isn't one of my videos I was talking
about how I typically am definitely that
person that goes to Sephora are Ulta
over buying at the individual websites
because I love deals I love coupons I
love points I love all of it you should
see my wallet it's full of different
cards and punch cards and rewards
programs because like if I'm gonna spend
money like I want I want a reward for it
like I want someone to clap for me when
I spend money I'm like yeah come on give
it to me
so I'm tart does have a really good one
I bought something recently from Toro it
was when I bought like the clay play
palette
and I think about their sick foundation
there too they do have a good reward
system there of course sold at both
Sephora and Ulta but you know maybe if
they have a release come out early and
you can only get on the chart website
they do have a nice reward program so
someone said you'd like to see Beauty
bakery that would be interesting -
there's so many things out luck see
beauty there's so many items that I
would like to see at Sephora and Ulta
simply just to be able to see it and
swatch it and you know you know see it
myself I think that would be pretty cool
Oh erm indicate also has a nice reward
system that's good to know I've never
ordered from Urban Decay Michelle says I
still want to know how five dollar
makeup can afford shelf space me too
I'm just baffled I'm just I am I'm just
baffled Miki says Beauty bakery is at
forever 21 yep I think that's a newer
thing more indie brands someone else
said Beauty bakery Oh Katie you're
talking about you babes oh yeah you
always gotta use eBay
yeah I mean you just you always gotta
use eBay that's just a you know that's
just a must I feel like my comments are
a little bit behind but yes if you don't
use Ebates I mean not every store is on
there but definitely Sephora and Altos
on there and yeah you just get cash back
for shopping like it's like you know
that's how that's that's who I feel like
it's clapping for me it's eBay Thank You
Brooke thank you guys so much thank you
guys Julian says I walked into my local
opportunity I was completely different
it look like Sephora oh my gosh Michelle
says I just got fifty five dollars back
from Ebates yes it's always so nice when
you get the ones that say it called it
like the big fat make a fat check or
something like that you're always like
yeah score and then you're like yeah
that's actually cuz I did a lot of
shopping it's so funny so let's see what
you get this thing just says oh gosh
Samantha you have a community of such
supportive people seriously I do
I mean there's no there's just no other
way that I can that I can say it I mean
and it's so it's it's so interesting to
me and I talk about it a lot this is a
little off topic from Sephora and
whatnot but you know there's always such
such downfalls to social media and
there's you know the cyber bullying that
people deal with and you know there's
all these bad things but then it's like
a look at all these great things like
look at all these great relationships
and friendships that people get to make
with people all over and you know it's
just it's a really amazing thing it
really is and I am a super grateful for
that so thank you guys um so I've you
guys are saying your Altos look really
different I'm gonna go I can't remember
the last time I run into my Appa
I typically shop online because I don't
I don't like to leave my house if I
don't have to I don't like to go to the
mall I don't like to go into stores I
don't really like to go anywhere so I
typically shop online then you get your
emails so much easier but I kind of I'm
super curious now I kind of want to go
to also just to see what it looks like
so Mickey says you're going to Yalta
tomorrow yeah let us know how different
it looks different oh I'm super curious
thank you Thank You Bobbi Lynn thank you
so much um Jessica sighs I'm a home
person to only online shopping yeah for
real thing I just I just can't man
I just good oh hey I feel like I missed
a comment somewhere that I was gonna say
um shoot shoot shoot shoot
oh um okay so Jillian asked you feel
some people won't like colour-pop being
in Sephora since it's seen as a high-end
place yeah and that's that's kind of
what that's kind of what I'm just super
curious about it I wish I wish the floor
and I mean you know they're they
probably are testing the waters like
someone mentioned earlier so you know
maybe they won't get too out of hand
bringing in affordable brands before
they kind of do this like test run or
whatnot um but yeah I'm curious I'm
I'm curious what the feedback is is
gonna be - and how people are gonna like
it and whatnot um Tammy says when I came
online in 2001 that's what amazed me the
most and still amazes me is meeting
people from all over the world yeah for
sure
I you know I started to blog in in 2009
and really I mean I had a couple of
reasons for doing it nope my my eyes
that was my real life color thank you so
much but yeah so I started my blog in
2009 and a big reason it was a book blog
big reason was was trying to meet people
in the industry because I was wanting to
publish a book but then another reason
was because I just wanted to talk to
like-minded people like me I didn't have
a lot of people in my life that I wanted
to talk about like books and makeup and
workouts with me like my friends were
into other things and I was like I don't
know we wouldn't talk to ya like it was
kind of lonely you know I was what was I
20 or something I don't even know um you
know we have this big group of friends
from college but it was like no one
wanted to talk about the same things I
wanted to talk about and it was kind of
like lonely at the same time so that's
that was a really big reason why I
started my my blog and you know it's
it's another similar reason why I
started YouTube you just want to meet
people who have the same interest in you
that you can talk about that's really
fun so Thank You Margot forcing my eyes
are beautiful Melissa says Ulta has
Becca now and champagne pop I love you
papa um okay so let me look at the
comments I just says your eyes are so
beautiful I have two different eye
colors and I always have one contact to
cover it up oh you should have two
different eye colors that's so cool my
friend Kiera I had a blue eye and a
green eye I mean she's told us she sure
still has a blue and a green eye and I
just always thought it was sauce I'm
Hollie thank you thank you guys thank
you thank you okay yeah we should also
just don't cover your eyes yeah that's
that's so unique like that's so unique
that's amazing
okay so Gillian says I agree with the
friends thing I've lost most my
girlfriend since moving so there's no
one to talk about makeup but yeah
something that's really really awesome
about social media is that you can you
know you can you can make all these
different friends with your same
interests whether it be makeup or books
are gaming or you know math whatever it
is you're into whatever it is you're
into you can find someone to talk about
that well thank you thank you guys why
what are some well what do you guys want
to my next okay so we kind of touched on
color pop and we touched on the rewards
so what do you guys think about the the
weekly Wow's these different specials
that they're doing and I don't I guess I
don't quite get it because I saw him one
week but now I don't see them anymore
and I know this week they're having like
the four times three times etc so it's
that kind of in place of their weekly
Wow's or do you think they're gonna do
more specials again or did I miss like
just somebody no because it like that's
a legitimate question I have because I
don't know that answer like oh they're
coming back and I know people said they
have these weekly Wow's these certain
pallets that were on sale but they sold
out really fast so okay so Debbie says
they sold out so I wonder if they'll
have more so I don't know let me see so
Angelica says I like the weekly Wow's
but they sold out on the first day
Jessica who's doing the weekly allows it
Sephora that was doing him there's Katie
says I think they're supposed to draw up
new deals every Thursday okay okay
Michelle says it feels less high-end but
I'm not mad at changing the structure
yet yeah I think that's a really good
point Michelle it does it you know
Sephora is like so far is like our
high-end our our luxury mama you know
and so now it definitely feels a lot
different but but yeah like I like I
like you Michelle like you're not mad at
it you're just kind of like whoa whoa
like whoa oh that's super interesting so
um I scroll back up so yeah that's
really good to know I think you said
Thursday's did that they'll come back so
I'll go ahead and check
so I guess that's a good point so if you
want to check out a weekly Wow on
Thursday I would say probably get to the
site early and then um because they will
sell out so if there's something that
you see that you really want make sure
you snag it right away because it seems
like they'll have pretty limited
quantities of everything so oh wait
someone said would that come and go
trend mode gave a sneak peak for this
weekend it's benefit and parrot con I
wonder what it'll be from benefit so oh
my husband's home Oh Ryan says I got the
Tarte palette Oh from the Alta deal Oh
Ayers
there's written in a merger bot whoa
that have been bad Oh crazy okay
ah let's see oh I always forget that my
my am my laptop is a touchscreen so
sorry it says I have a bad connection if
I'm not coming through okay
oh if you like the comments are coming
in so fast
hi I'm live I don't this is the brow kit
oh I actually bought a brow kit my god I
actually bought a brow kit um Katie you
are fast like you are fat yeah you all
this I bought the brow kit I think it
came with like precisely my brow and
crap I can't remember but the brackets I
thought were actually a really good
price so if they're gonna have them on
sale for even cheaper thank you thank
you thank you so much yeah Cory says
Katy is doing a great job today
Katy you are you are the boss today
you sure are um so let's see you yes
I'll be curious how how much the bro

someone said what color is my wall paint
it's red it's red I did not paint it
this is how I move down Jessica said
your moderator is doing perfect yes yes
they are now we're about to wrap it up
we're at 31 minutes so about to wrap it
up but I mean I think my doctor allowed
we talked about color pop we talked
about the rewards we talked about hello
we talked about color pop we talked
about rewards we talked about weekly
Wow's is there anything else you guys
want to talk about Sephora rise by you
already have the kids in my Sephora card
night yeah so plunger Beauty set I
missed out on the ABH contour kit for
$20 I thought about that one too I
looked at I like should I get that
because I love come to her
Stacy says I've never participated in a
live chat where the moderator was as on
the ball as yours for real um oh shoot
I think if you I I never know how to put
the links in my videos I'm really about
it doing that but katie has a youtube
channel I think if you click on our name
it will take you to her channel I think
but you guys should go ahead and
subscribe to Katie and just go tell her
that she was the frickin boss today so
okay so we're at 32 minutes so I think
we got through a lot actually I feel
like we talked about a lot we say we say
pretty on topic pretty pretty well not
great not great but you know that's what
happens when you do lives but thanks
guys because I actually found out some
good information from you guys too and
got some new new thoughts about all the
changes at Sephora and it's just really
interesting and like I was saying
earlier with the social media thing it's
just interesting to see what you guys
think and what you guys have to say and
that's why she's a hammer that is why
she adds a hammer so yeah but that was
really interesting for me too to
learning and get your feedback as well
because like I said I I wanted to do
this video more as a live versus a
regular video because it's not like I
have a wealth of information on
this top Baker I don't have any like
insider knowledge or anything so I
basically was just gonna be saying what
I know and then ask you guys a lot of
questions because I'm just always
curious to get your feedback so um so
let's see what you guys are saying Holly
says I love that I had a patient no-show
exactly the right time for your life

here but I want to say thank you guys
