I'm having it so to kick this off I'm
having so many issues already going live
and it took me a really long time to be
able to even get on hi hi everyone and
then like right before like as I was
trying to let me go live it was like
you're are going to experience quality
issues with the stream are you sure you
want to I'm like well what's my other
choice no so I don't know this um live
stream quality might really suck I don't
know what's going on and I kept trying
to upload a thumbnail and it kept
failing I don't know what's going on
some weird things are happening but hi
everybody
and like right now it says very bad
connection I don't know what's going on
we've had people digging holes in our
yard so I'm sure that's something to do
with it so that's fun but how's
everybody's Thursday going let me try to
find my live stream so I can read all
the comments there we are and see that's
not the thumbnail that I did I don't
know what's going on this last year but
YouTube is like really on my last nerve
at this moment so I don't know I don't
know how this one's good
Oh for us writing okay I guess I'm in
the comments I can see everybody okay ah
so happy Thursday welcome to another
livestream today's lecture I did my
Twitter poll and what got by far the
most votes was another beauty tag video
I did this I did a beauty take video a
couple weeks back and that's what got
voted on and then it wasn't sure what to
do and actually my friend Katie who she
is my moderator you always see Katie in
here nice lives she said that just today
well it says two hours ago she did the
fall feels tag on her YouTube channel
and she
tagged me so I was like well perfect
we're gonna go ahead and do that one
then so I haven't even been able to look
at it I just had dinner with some
girlfriends so I just got home but
that's what we're gonna do today and I
figured that I'm just gonna do one tag
and usually I'm live for about an hour
but I'm gonna try to keep it to around
the half-hour mark a couple different
well third different reason is because
YouTube apparently hates me tonight and
doesn't want me to livestream the Cubs
are playing I'm a Chicago Cubs fan this
is an elimination game and I've never I
don't like to watch elimination games
with people and now I'm watching it in a
live stream like this could be real bad
and then also my phone snow day so we're
only at about 50 percent battery and I
usually do a live at a full 100% battery
so we'll see we'll see how this goes but
I'm gonna go ahead and click on Katie's
video if you guys have not subscribed to
Katie yet she's here in the comments I
saw her and make sure I think you just
click on her name and it'll take you to
our channel and you can see that she did
this fall tags video today and make sure
you subscribe and save come from the
live so so what's up and let's see okay
so I'm gonna find she listed the coast
with the questions in the description
box which is great so I'm just gonna go
through and read them oh that's only
nine questions okay so that should there
shouldn't be too long I'm like a
frazzled I'm like a frazzled mess over
here and if you follow me on snapchat
you know I don't have no candy to eat in
the house to be a bad night it's gonna
be a bad name okay let's see everybody
I'm just looking up the comments okay so
let's see here I was where I need to
send you some candy for real it's so
funny because I messaged my mom all the
time and she messaged me like right
outside
at 7:00 are you ready and I said I was
ready and she said I don't have any
candy all I have this tootsie rolls and
I was like we are the same people I love
it
okay so the fall feels Beauty Tech from
Katy the first question is I think keeps
doing somewhere oh it keeps saying very
bad connection I have a feeling it's
going to kicked me out at some point I
don't know what to do for you YouTube
you're driving me crazy okay so the very
first question is fall beauty my dog
just did something weird
what does fault what does that mean okay
what's that mean fall beauty like your
favorite Beauty you favorite beauty
trend or something what's that oh my
gosh YouTube good thing this was a night
that I said I wanted to not be on very
long because this is freaking insane

fall

definitely like that lip color the I
don't have any lip color on right now so
just eating dinner but like that
brick-red
type of lip color that definitely like
my eye shadows tonight the orange like
red coppers that definitely makes me
think a fall I've been doing so many
orange makeup it was really pretty
because it for like four videos straight
on my youtube channel you saw me with
like some variation of a purple eye look
and now it's all like reds and oranges
so that's what I'm into right now but I
feel like those two things definitely
make me single fall it's a warm tone
eyes and that brick red lip
that's definitely fall like what do you

warm tones Marcy says warm tones Carolyn

talking to me or someone in the
livestream Katie says goes that one I
live for the first oh I do I should just

drove by myself and it was so scary
and it was like 10 hours or something

had to drive home on actual Thanksgiving
Day to make it back to my classes in
time and I wasn't thinking but nothing

your County Fair our County Fair is
usual in the summers ours are in like
June July I want to say and I would say
if there is usually in August so that's
funny ok so let's see you guys have some
memories oh ok so the last question is
the oh your fall bucket list oh that's
funny
Bob bucket list we totally should make a
bucket list um
me and my friends made a summer bucket
list and that was so much fun it was so
much fun to do because there was just
like we always knew that we were gonna
be doing something you know it wasn't
one of those like what do you want to do
what you like do what do you want to do
we were like like some from the list
then we're gonna roll with it we should
totally make a follow on but we're kind
of behind um
ball bucket list what do I want to do no
this is after thinking yeah I want to
say I want to do all the things that you
guys well I want to do that winery tour
now that sounds like fun
um pumpkin patch a sentences mines to
get a new job already
Michelle's us to finish Christmas
shopping before Christmas Eve that's a
solid solid bucket list item girlfriend
I like that one Haley says hi from
Arizona sit down Brittany says corn maze
I don't know corn maze would probably
freak me out um I could use some money
if my twin is trying to drag me to go to
the Eastern State Penitentiary
good luck good luck yeah um let's see
make Sam eat gumbo I don't know how do
you make gumbo
um I bet my husband would be into that
he wanted to make the other night what
did he say he wanted to make Matt gumbo
jambalaya
he said he wanted to make jambalaya and
I was like what okay
that's brand-new um see me says you
should make some yummy crock-pot
hacked-up wait crock-pot hot chocolate
what is that sorcery that's crazy
I've never heard of such a thing you
will have to tell me about that Holly
says drink excesses excessive amounts of
quantity so yeah I would like to do this
binary tour or at least just visit a
winery
this game is math game is not going
great
hey listen I can send you my gumbo
recipe it takes 8 8 hours my gumbo Wow
dang Molly says this saw I'd like to
teach my dog to sit in the kayak without
tipping it over a does whole area that
is awesome
have you heard of a hot chocolate bar
like an ice cream bar for a party but
hot chocolate I would like that I would
have like a party for one that sounds
fantastic Ashlyn says the Omaha zoo I
have been there that was mentioned eyes
like first trip out of town together we
went to the Omaha zoo we were only like
19 or something or 20 we didn't have a
whole lot of options
nobody Assam Moors bar oh my gosh that
sounds fantastic
yeah I'm trying to think I would I would
love to be able to go to a football game
we were really looking at like Packers
and the Buccaneers game and gets in
early December because our friend Matt
is Tampa Bay fan and they play each
other this year but even though a Tampa
Bay is like not very good the tickets
are still so expensive we're just crazy
so I don't know if we'd be able to get
there but that would be definitely
really cool because otherwise I would
like to go to a Cubs game I love one of
sporting events I think that's so much
fun
but you know this is an elimination game
the Cubs aren't doing well so that might
not be happening I was hoping to go to
least one game of the series but maybe
we'll work on the football game instead
we'll work on the football game oh good
Moses's I think I'll buy my dad tickets
to a brands game that would be cool CB
says do you watch college football I
don't a ton um I kind of can I can keep
up with it you know for like Iowa State
mostly an Iowa here but I don't I don't
watch it a lot I feel like I have
trouble really getting invested in
because like to me on my precious
college goods like why I so mean to him
like these guys I can get mad at you are
professionals you have proof that this
is your job you need to be doing better
right now sugar cocoa ma yeah um someone
asked if I could do a relationship
advice video oh man you know I've never
considered that I've never considered
that I don't feel like I'm any sort of
and you sort of expert at all in that
area Melissa says are you into fantasy
football um I've done it a couple times
but I don't know I feel like I feel like
sometimes people can get like too into
it and I just kind of like weirds me out
to know you know like the people you
play with I feel like people get to a
little crazy so Oh Erica says I love
your wavy hair oh thank you this is uh
this is when I don't have enough time to
actually do my hair I just um I skip
conditioner and put a bunch of moves in
it listen s is over good I mean he says
you have been with much for a long time
so it's a you know a thing or two Moe
says what if your characters in the book
and gave advice I could try that okay
try that okay you guys are giving me
some good video ideas too um I know I
think I'm gonna try to do an office one
I I was actually going to film in my
office tonight now that I have the
lighter background I feel like I could
film in there easier that's why I came
out here because it was always so dark
even with my ring light I'm doing these
lives at night but because the Cubs game
is on I'm out here watching the game but
I think that I will do like an office
tour because I feel like I have it
organized pretty good it's not great but
I feel like yeah it worked nice pretty
good not everything's moved in yet but I
think I'll do a little office tour and
show you guys and how
I set up my makeup and all that so I
don't know when I'll do that maybe for
like next Saturday or something since I
don't usually post on Saturdays I could
do like a bonus video I definitely
wouldn't be the Saturday because I don't
I don't haven't filmed but I figure
before my office goes into full disarray
like it normally is I could go ahead and
film that enjoyment you get it but yeah
um so we're at 32 minutes so I feel like
this is good we got through all those
questions I'll be fall feels tag which
is good so if you guys haven't checked
out Katy's channel yet this is where I
got to the tag questions a from so
Katie's here in the comments you can
just click her name and head over to her
channel don't mind me don't mind me so
yeah I'm gonna go ahead and step away
because it looks like the Cubs game is
getting pretty out of control so before
