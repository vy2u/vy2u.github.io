how's everyone doing on this Thursday
night newsflash I'm not doing well if
you can't tell but my face oh man I'm
getting sick and I'm so completely
bummed out about this but you know what
it's um it's happening it's happening
that's here hi guys hi everybody okay
ah let's see I need to find my live chat
you guys will probably be able to hear
Airy snoring because she is very very
loud right now um let's see let me find
my live chat hi guys
yeah I don't feel great at all I
honestly thought about just not doing a
live or not I have a bad connection
I might actually have to go out and go
back in oh no um hi
okay no we're okay sorry it was telling
me stuff on the screen about my quality
you know leave the huge um yeah I really
don't I don't feel I don't feel well um
I tried I put on some some pure powder
and I put on some concealer mascara and
also some gimme brow and that is it
oh no I puts a little bit of brown
shadow from the NARS bond and palette
and that's it that's all I could do for
you guys so I apologize that's all I can
muster up tonight I've just been a kind
of feeling like a I don't know like I
just woke up and that my day was like
immediately go go go because we were dog
sitting today so I knew I had to be up
and like it Ares fed and the mascara is
the ico this mascara here so I just knew
I had to like you know beating a rush
this morning kind of and it wasn't till
like I really kind of finally sat down
is probably not even to like 10 o'clock
I was like what is wrong with me I was
talking to my mom on the phone and I
just felt like I couldn't connect like I
was so like disengaged and quiet and I
was like oh I don't I don't feel well I
actually don't feel good so no I'm so
bad I've been seeing everybody being
sick like I feel like we're passing it
through each other's like through our
YouTube videos cuz I'm like why is
everybody on YouTube sick and now it's
me great fantastic dang it
but so I apologize I know I'm not like
up to snuff I was wearing gray
sweatpants earlier and I was like wow
you've been wearing those since last
night so I went and put on a different
pair of gray sweatpants young got my
gray sweat pants on yep that's what I
did so that's how I am today but so I'm
probably going to make this a little bit
shorter of a live I do want to get my
work done for tonight and in bed a
little bit earlier because tomorrow is
going to be a busy day and then Saturday
we get on the road to start traveling I
do apologize if you can hear air is
snoring she is right here on my chair
with me and
she is just gone we dog said a boxer
today
a one-year-old boxer and she is
exhausting so you're probably gonna hear
her snoring I was just talking on my
snapchat because I did my my poll on
Twitter and asked the topic and what was
voted on for today was to do a holiday
tag and I thought that would be super
fun I was like yeah let's do it and then
20 minutes ago I was on my snapchat like
hey I'll be live soon and then I was
like cool I don't have a tag or
questions or anything so I was like
frantically looking at YouTube and Katie
my moderator she snapped me like right
before I went to get off snapchat and
gold live and she said that there's a
tag called the holly jolly holly jolly
tag I think it was what it was called
and that's what we're gonna do what's on
my lips what's on my lips just all I
could do tonight was the drunk elephant
lippy Bom
that's it okay so yeah Katie's here yeah
Katie says vintage or tacky did it
recently so I found the I think it was
someone else that I found the questions
from but I was able to find a video
hopefully this is the right one because
I saw like Holly Jolly regular and then
I saw people doing holly-jolly too so I
don't know if I'm doing the right tag
but these are holiday questions hi Kelly
I knew it how's everybody doing oh man
okay and I remembered not to take a
photo on my phone like I did the last
time I did a tag because I do lives off
my phone thinking this one through a
little bit better today so I'm just
gonna go through these questions and
answer them I literally just found them
so I have nothing plans so that's like
super exciting when you're live but the
first question is do you start your
Christmas shopping on Black Friday or
wait until last minute I I feel like
what I always do is I start really
really soon
like I don't I can't remember the first
Christmas present I bought this year but
I remember it was really really early it
was like it was even before about Friday
I was like yes and I'm doing awesome and
I'm amazing and then you know Christmas
is in a couple days and we still have
gifts to buy so I always start off
really strong and really early and then
I fade away into nothingness hello Mimi
says you are done before Black Friday
not jealous not jealous of that at all
how do you do that man you know
sometimes I get a little frustrated with
some people though because it's like
you're like hey what do you want for
Christmas and they're like I don't care
and I'm like you know if you would just
tell us like just just let me know
I could be finished so much quicker but
then I'm trying to think and you know
playing it I don't know it's just so
much harder I might just tell me just
tell me what you want like my sister a
lot we draw names for like my husband's
side there's
there's a like six of us older kids
which has a brother and sister and they
have spouses and we'll draw names and so
my sister-in-law sent me a text she was
like what do you want for Christmas I
was like hold on and I screenshot at a
bunch of stuff off my Sephora loves list
I was like boom there you go like make
it easy on us that's what I think um but
yeah we usually start fairly early but
we're always struggling always
struggling at the finish line um the
second question is if you could be in
any Christmas movie what would it be if
I could be in any Christmas movie I
don't know I don't even know that many
Christmas movies I wish I could get
areas to go in her cave because she is
snoring so loud um oh that's so hard
um the Santa Claus with Tim Allen that's
a good one that is Oh hah alone I always
forget that home alone is a Christmas
movie A Christmas Story die hard
those are all good ones the grinch yeah
you guys have much better ones than nice
to maybe says I want to go down the
slide in a Christmas story elfia else's
else's just like the best killer you
save the Grinch for sure Wow
hey your little girlfriend
nightmare before christmas wait it's not
a scary one that's George's dozen white
Christmas I'm so sorry she's so loud
okay let's see let's see um third
question which do you like better
Christmas Eve or Christmas Day I feel
like I feel like I'm gonna say Christmas
Eve because Christmas Day typically
always involves traveling like having to
come home from wherever I am so that's
always not so much fun especially
because I live in Iowa so a lot of times
it's snowing oh I just dropped my Kindle
um so yeah I feel like I would say
Christmas Eve and I have a lot of really
good memories from Christmas Eve that's
when we used to celebrate like when I
was a little little girl and I got my
grandma's and stuff we always take
Christmas Eve so I would say that
because we always have you travel
Christmas Day which isn't which isn't
fun a lot of you guys are saying Eve I'm
saying both let's see Christmas Day
because I don't have to work yeah I get
that I feel that let's see sorry I'm
gonna try to get there these kind of as
quickly as I get and you know like when
you're sick like you feel like you're I
don't know you just you just you're just
not right you know you don't you just
you're just not all right and I keeps
flashing that I have a bad connection
I know YouTube you hate when I go live
you hate it
I know number four when does your family
put up your Christmas tree and who
decorates it
we don't put up a Christmas tree okay so
before everybody gets mad at me we don't
put up a Christmas tree because it's
just Mitch and I we have a dog who likes
doing things so that's not good
and we always leave over the holidays so
like I don't know I'm just kind of like
why have a tree and I just don't really
get it I don't feel like we enjoy it as
much like I feel like definitely like
down the road if we have children and
stuff like yeah we do but like we also
don't do Christmas lights I sometimes
like to say that I don't really feel
like I feel like I lack a lot of female
genes sometimes like decorating and just
like going all out for the holidays I'm
like I just don't know I'm just it's
just not in me it's just it's like it's
just truly not in me it's never been in
me I'm a terrible hostess like please
don't ask me to host a party I'm awful
at it like people come over to the house
I'm like hey sup bitches like are you
gonna ask if they like want something to
drink I'm like oh yeah you want
something to drink catching your coat
sorry come on in
like I'm awful at all of these things so
I always tell Mitch I'm like if you are
really like I want a tree I want to put
lights up I want to do this I want to do
that I'm like you go for it you got this
and I'll just be here it's like my mom
calls me what does she always say to
really fought humbug or whatever and I'm
like it's not that I don't like it or I
don't enjoy it or I'm like bitch is like
let's put these lights on no don't do it
I'm like I just don't have the time to
do it but if someone else wants to do it
for me like be my goodness you know so
we don't have a tree but my
mother-in-law has a tree and she puts it
up fairly early so there's that
that's the tree that is good for
Christmas
number five is white lights or colored
lights like I said we don't put up any
lights I feel like we're like one of the
only houses on the block that doesn't
put up like there's like two other
houses hey Liz there's like two other
houses that don't put a blight tonight I
don't feel so bad especially because I
know those two houses have children too
so I'm like I'm just over here with my
dog chillin um but white light they're
colored lights I don't know I feel like
I like them both I feel like white looks
really kind of like classic you know
what I'm saying but color can be super
fun and there's a house like up the
street like their whole side of the
house cuz they're like on the corner so
the side of the house that faces the
street like it has like a whole dance
party going on if I like colored lights
and I'm like yeah I love it everybody
else is so festive I mean I live
vicariously through them so a lot of you
guys are saying well a lot of you guys
at first said white and then I saw a lot
of colored come in lift says your whole
tree looks like a rainbow jealous that
sounds nice one day we'll have a tree
one day we'll have a tree feel it number
six are you guilty of peeking at your
presents or do you like to be surprised
I like to be surprised I'm trying to
think if I have ever like peeked at a
present I don't think I have I like to
be surprised I think it's kind of fun I
don't think I mean maybe I was like a
child
I like peek at the presents a present
once um but I don't think so I think I
like to be surprised like I'm the person
when I get like an Ipsy bag or something
like that and it you know you get the
email that tells you what's in the empty
bag I'm like I'm not looking because I'm
gonna be surprised like I don't know I
don't know why that is but yeah I like
to I like to be surprised
oh let's see I like to watch other
people other people's presents more than
opening mine I do I love watching people
open presents especially ones that I get
and like if I know they're gonna be
really excited about something I'm like
over it over to open it
Emily says I'm so bad as a little kid I
picked all the time that's awesome let's
see okay what was that number six so
number seven is would you rather live in
a gingerbread house or in that Santa's
workshop whatever they live in a
gingerbread house or a Santa's workshop
well I feel like Santa's workshop would
like put me to work you know and like a
gingerbread house that was smell really
good and I would probably eat a lot so
gingerbread house
[Laughter]
Angelica's on gingerbread house but I
might get huge tons of money
Kelly's a gingerbread house and we're
gingerbread house okay a lot of you guys
Sara
maybe it would made us get off I'm still
trying to work through that bag of
Skittles still working on it
slowly but surely oh no closest what's
your coupon code this is a test no no I
never know my cute vodka I never know
the punch and try to make one up off the
top of my head don't work

I can't wait to get a new bag skittles
it's gonna be great when they don't
break my teeth oh man we were just at
the grocery store last night and I
forgot to get a bag man all right number
eight tell us your Christmas Eve
traditions just Christmas Eve traditions
I don't know if that should be Christmas
traditions or just Christmas Eve but the
question that I copied from the video I
found says Christmas Eve traditions ah
let's see here well when I was a kid
when I was younger lose this flamin hot
cheeto house for me live this is totally
random but you know that I sent you a
box I tried to find the
hot cheetos to send you and I can't find
them here do we not have them in Iowa is
this not a thing who lives in Iowa that
can tell me because I went to two
different stores and neither of whom had
the hot cheetos I was like wait did I
make that up
or is that not a thing really I'm like I
don't I'm just just super confused I
thought that would be really cool let's
sneak in there but I was in know like
where are they I looked at Target and
that IB come find no hot cheetos I was
super confused
that's totally off topic but where'd you
guys find the hot cheetos I was so bad
dude I was like strolling to all the
asses like maybe there aren't a special
spot still can't find them maybe I'm
just crazy here's a room I don't even I
don't like hot stuff I don't like how
they're spicy so I've never looked for
hot cheetos ever before a couple of
weeks ago that was like Oh
gas stations like okay you guys are
saying gas stations I did not think to
go to a gas station hi V is like our
like our local grocery store here in the
Midwest ah gas station I wouldn't even a
lot of that shoot well learn something
too every day um but so the question Oh
Christmas Eve traditions so when I was a
kid I really enjoyed Christmas Eve
because we would all go to my
grandmother's house like everyone on my
mom's side of the family would go to
Grandma's house and we would just eat
and there was always like an adult gift
exchange but there was always like like
the little kids got to do a little
exchange too like we would draw names
because there were so many cousins we
would draw names and then exchanged
gifts and then the adults always did one
but like the kids would fall asleep by
then and on the way there we would
always drive by all the houses and we
would look at all the Christmas lights
and stuff and then I would typically
fall asleep at Grandma's and wake up and
it was Christmas so I always loved
Christmas Eve so much as a kid that was
awesome um now typically we spend
Christmas Eve with Mitch
the family because they're closer my
family is Army and they are in Alabama
right now so it's typically really hard
to fly to them because it's super
expensive and driving is always pretty
tough as well especially when I think
right now where they are
are they 19 hours away no not 19 14
hours
I don't know it's a really long time if
they're really far drive away and
Mitch's family is only an hour and a
half so are they at fort record they are
at Redstone Arsenal Redstone Arsenal um
but so yeah so sorry
so we typically go to Mitch's and it
kind of just depends like sometimes
we're just with his immediate family
sometimes we're with like the big
extended family I really have no idea
what's going on Christmas Eve this year
as well but yeah that's that's typically
what we do so let me see what you guys
heard together soon
oh my comments are behind we're still oh

David and all them so many of my friends
were messaging me like you have to see a
pitch perfect it's pitch perfect see
right you'll have to see pitch for every
two plays in it and I'm like why what
what why what's going on um we used to
have a tree like when we lived in our
condo and before we have areas and all
that we didn't have like a baby tree
that we would put up in the condo just
for the fun of it and at the top of the
tree we had a Packers ornament that was
our tree topper like it was kind of
shaped shaped like a star and it was
Packers so that's what we used to have
on our tree tops your trees it sounds
like a dirty question live something I
want areas that are macaron bed under
the tree oh man it's so funny she I mean
that cave was like the best purchase of
our life but we've been dog sitting more
and more and every single dog loves that
cave like the boxer today would not get
off the cave for anything like that was
his spot he chose it I was like you got
it you can even borrow the cave for the
day it's fine um but yeah so we don't
have a tree this year
but when we did have one it was the
Packers start we really enjoyed the ball
oh can we see your dog she is a sleeping
on my chair right now uh-huh maybe I'll
wake her up towards the end but she's

have you ever gone Christmas caroling
I don't think so no no I've never gone
Christmas caroling I was trying to think
like I was a kid or if I went around
anywhere but no I don't think I did any
Christmas Caroline have you guys done
during Christmas caroling I mean I don't
have much of a voice but oh what's on
your bucket list that's awesome I don't
think I could do it sober how about
Christmas karaoke you know I really want
to karaoke and I keep telling like I
swear like every single time we go out
I'm like we're gonna karaoke tonight and
then we don't so that's awkward
we then we don't I mean I can't sing and
like I would be terrible but I feel like
I would have a great time you know Liv
says are you making a new bucket list in
2018 for sure we definitely got to do
that because the summer bucket list was
a great idea we actually still have a
few items on our list and we had kind of
like a team huddle the other night with
the other couple to figure out how we
knock off some of these things and we
came up with a pretty epic plan actually
I can't wait to to show you guys that it
cuz it's gonna be pretty good it's gonna
be pretty good but we need to get this
first our first bucket list all
accomplished I think we only have like
three like three things left on our
bucket list so not too bad but we'll
definitely be having another bucket list
she's arrived
do you see what you set up and she
stretches like that like clean clean
everybody is so excited to see you're
just gonna give him the cold shoulder
the whole time her eyes aren't even open
her eyes are not open
she is so dire oh yeah let's you two
people love what she did so good oh and
she's backed up
oh I just love dogs Oh number 13 do you
countdown to Christmas that Tyra Banks
over-the-shoulder oh I can't wait to see
that back on the replay I wonder if
she's my dude the same time uh we don't
really count down to Christmas I know
when we were back at in Mitch's hometown
last week for a birthday party it was at
my sister-in-law's house and she has
three girls and like they made like
those chains and then you like pull off
the chain you know which I thought was
super cute but they also said that she
pulls off like two a day like I can't
remember so I'm just gonna pull up
another ones of the day throw no not
quite all there but we don't really
count down or anything um I don't know I
feel like maybe as you get older and
stuff it it's almost like a countdown to
more stress like I'm super I feel like
this is maybe like part of like why I'm
getting like sick or rundown it's
because I've been non-stop every single
day this week trying to get ready to you
know have the four days out of town or
whatever it is we're gonna be like I've
been just boom boom boom so I think I
just got like a rundown so I'm hoping if
I just I kind of just took it easy today
and then trying to go to bed early and
maybe sleep in a little bit or something
but hopefully I can just kick it but I
feel it's almost like a countdown to
stress like you haven't done enough you
haven't baked enough you need to travel
you need to please all the different
sides of your family and stuff like that
like oh man it's it's crazy Katie says
I've been counting down but only because
I'm ready for Christmas to be over in my
due date to get here Katie is due so
soon so soon oh my gosh that's gonna be
wild oh that's gonna be so cool um let's
see oh then it says do you countdown to
Christmas if so how many days are left
what's today's date even what is there
four days left Friday Saturday Sunday
Monday yeah Christmas does it on Monday
right
whoa that's not good yeah Katie's due
date it's New Years Eve oh so cool so
cool okay let's see number 14 is what
are some foods and treats you can count
on having every holiday season that's a
good question um usually we have like a
big gathering from Mitch's side of the
family and there's always a really good
cheesecake they're like I never even
knew that I like cheesecake to kind of
always like pass it over and then when
we were back at Christmas everyone was
like no you have to try this too this
cheesecake because like one of Mitch's
dance was like a professional Baker at
one point and such and she always brings
this cheesecake and I tried it and now
I'm obsessed with cheesecake like
obsessed with it I love it love it but
she always brings one every Christmas
and I get so excited like I get like the
biggest pieces and I just hope that no
one notices or judges me like what you
look at my plate like like I take very
little of everything else and then just
like like a giant piece of cheesecake
it's called balance you know called
balance
um but it I feel like cheesecake is the
one that popped into my mind peanut
butter balls that sounds good Oh areas
of snoring again if you can hear what
I'll see you guys I keep looking at the
list of questions and that the comments
um see it's called balanced whipped
shortbread ice cream cake man I always
try to get like cuz we're we're doing
this thing with my just family and
everyone has to bring a dish bitches
like what should we bring and I was like
ice cream cake and he's like no we can't
bring like I want to bring ice cream
cake to everything like Oh going to a
friend's house for a sleepover
I'll bring ice cream cake I don't know
having a bad day
I'll go get ice cream cake like I love
ice cream cake
I love it and again it's like one of
those things like every year people are
like what do you want for your birthday
I'm like ice cream cake and no one
brings me it and I'm like every year
I've been asking for the same thing
since I was like 13 years old like one
year I just bought myself my own ice
cream cake screw it I by myself and had
a minion on it and everything I mean
technically is for me and my friend
Shannon because her birthday is the day
before mine but I mostly those were me
yeah your people have ice okay good the
Dairy Queen I was from cake is with us
yes and we live right by a Dairy Queen
like so simple like at the ice cream
cake I thought it was a good idea Mitch
was like let's bring a cheese and
cracker try it I was like wow me you
know apparently that's what we're
bringing so no ice cream cake for me
just to bake them I think I can hot
cheetos get ready for it number 15 this
is the last question how has Christmas
kept it's magic for you as you've grown
older how has Christmas kept it's magic
for you as you've grown older that's a
good question
I'm trying to think I feel like I get
like really you guys can hear your heads
now I feel like I get really like
nostalgic around this time just with
Christmas and the new year and things
like that but I feel like I tell like a
lot of stories too like Mitch and my
friends or really anybody who listens to
me like I like to tell I mean obviously
I like tell stories I um storyteller um
but I like to tell stories and just like
remember like even just talking about
going to my grandma's house like seeing
the lights and going to Grandma's and
falling asleep there and things like
that I just like to kind of yeah I
reminisce more yeah definitely around
this time of year I really do
Susan said the magic is totally restored
when you have kids
faded away where'd you say totally
restored when you have kids that's
something to look forward to
yeah for sure i but i but thought it'd
be really fun like she's so loud but i
bet it would be fun to do like the elf
on the shelf and just kind of creating
your own little traditions and stuff
like that i think that would be really
cool for when having kids cuz it's fun
to see you know like my niece and
nephews and stuff and it's fun to see
like the magic you know continue on with
them and what they get excited about and
things like that that is really cool but
yeah for me I think it's definitely
probably just reminiscing and and all of
that I I get very nostalgic around this
time of year for sure so oh no elf is
the devil I always forget to remember to
move it
that would be hard like especially cuz
you always see always like a such
creative parents doing like the craziest
things with their else and I'm like I
would like put the elf in the sink and
be like boom it's in the sink dude oh my
gonna be like yeah not cool that's not
that's all you guys I'm like what no our
elf has been in a sleigh for days
that's like we all do the best we can
right we all just do the best we can um
Susan says you love all the sentimental
mushy holiday movies oh you guys um
someone asked me my favorite Christmas
movie elf
I love elf I can't
I could watch elf every day probably so
funny um yeah that's my it was that not
on the list I felt like that would've
been a good question but no I think we
got the although no that was all 15
questions so I'm Sophia says are you
doing a holiday tutorial I'll have one
up on Saturday like I get ready with me
and kind of
like my go-to it's like my goat it
really has become like my really go to
super quick and easy but but it's
glitter so I feel like that's really
like holiday vibes but I know that's
what I'm gonna bust out on Saturday
because we have to leave here early in
the morning because the event starts at
noon and it's an hour and half away and
we'd have to go into Aries back and
Yatta Yatta and then still get ready so
I'm going to recreate that look on
Saturday as well so I'm excited for that
one though I really like the way it came

the glitter so that will be Saturdays

Saturdays take a break and enjoy your
holiday I'm not posting anything on

thumb Tuesday's video before we leave so
well yeah yeah I'll take Monday off and
then the following Monday is New Year's
Day and I was thinking about doing a
live because I am switching my lives to
Monday's so I thought I could still do a
live on New Year's Day but I think I
decided I'm gonna I'm gonna take that
day off too and I think we're now doing
something New Year's Eve I didn't think
we were going to at first but it's
anything like last New Year's Eve we
stayed up till like 3:30 playing sorry
so in life sorry in life that was a
that's what we did super cool I don't
know yeah yeah so this is the last
Thursday night live chat yeah because we
will be switching to Mondays I'm still
trying to figure out what time though
because I asked on YouTube and also on
Twitter what time frame would work best
for people but I haven't decided yet cuz
then I got to figure out what actually
works for me too at the same time so I'm
not sure yet on Mondays but it won't be
for a couple weeks yet but I'll say it
somewhere like snapchat and Twitter and
all that and figure out what time but
I'm not sure I don't know
yeah I don't know I wish I wish I should
have had that planned already but I'm
like ah since it won't be for like two
more weeks or something I don't have it
worked out yet but yes my last Thursday
night live chat I don't know like I'm
sure some people won't be able to make
Mondays whenever it gets moved to but I
feel like you guys have been like my
Thursday night crew for the past season
here cuz I wanted I want to change about
every season or so to try to hit you
know more people and stuff but thanks
everybody for hanging out with me all
these Thursdays I appreciate it so much
I hope you guys enjoyed tonight's
holiday tag
I enjoyed it I'm glad I got some
questions ready I'm not sure if it'll
still be in the evening because like
nights probably won't work for me on
Monday
like not like a 7:30 like I could do
earlier in the evening but I don't know
how late I can do on Mondays but I know
well those have to stay at the same time
maybe something won't change in the next
couple weeks here but um I'm just not
100% on that but yeah that's gonna do it
for this live chat I was overly awkward
like I don't know how to end the live
chat but yeah I mean I will have I'll
have videos Friday Saturday and Sunday
