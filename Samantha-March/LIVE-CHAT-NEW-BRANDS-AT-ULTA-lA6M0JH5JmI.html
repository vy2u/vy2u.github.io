gonna be talking about a new brands at
Ulta I did my Twitter poll and that one
like by far
so I also asked like on snapchat and
stuff what it's like is there any
certain brands that you guys would want
to chat about and I definitely got a lot
of morphe and then also Milani and Lime
Crime was the other one so see how's
everybody doing hello lady and Margaret
and Melissa got a couple Stephanie isn't

Jen and Elkhart Indiana excellent oh boy
here comes areas already I'm not
gonna do this mystery case no you drove
me crazy last week okay so let's see
which which which brand would you guys
like to talk about first so let me know
hey Katie no you're not already I'm just
early the Cubs are on again I would
really like to watch this pop down a
little bit early yes violet boss I just
saw that as well I can't remember if it
was Ulta or Sephora but yeah violent
boss is coming I'm I'm pretty excited I
bought a lot of these brands because I
just think the reward systems are so
good at Sephora Natha that's why I I
just buy a lot from there well I mean I
think Altos better because I got my
Sephora
vib rouge gift today a mini brush not
even a full brush a mini brush a mini
brush worth a thousand a thousand
dollars I was like woo thank you thank
you Sephora
you are welcome for all my money thank
you for me and my new brush I
appreciated that but that's okay um what
are you gonna do this the whole time
again the whole time I really want to
switch to filming these lives in my
office because I feel like it'll be a
lot better now since it's so much
lighter and brighter in there but these
freakin games keep happening on Thursday
nights and like give me a break come on
man so let's see Erica says I agree they
need to step up the Rouge gift I mean it
seriously like last year it was just
teeny tiny little blush and then this
year I saw it was a brush and I got
excited and then I opened it and I was
like like you can't even give us a full
sized brush one brush you can't even
give us a full size like that's kind of
embarrassing okay let me see if I can
get areas what are you what like what do
you want from us what do you want from
the people they want us to they want us
to talk about makeup and you're over
here dressed in my left okay mostly if
she just hangs out I have a feeling she
won't okay so let's see so what I gotta
look back through the comments what what
brand did you guys want me to talk about
first oh yeah so we're talking about
violet boss yeah I'm super excited I
have tried the violet boss a Holy Grail
palette it is and I really like it I
really like those eyeshadows I thought
they were really good so I'm excited I
want to try some of their other
eyeshadow palettes too and don't they
have lashes I think they have lashes
that I've heard really good things about
so I'm pretty excited about that okay
wait so it's not someone just said valid
losses coming to Sephora is it Sephora
or Ulta I can't remember you there I
thought I saw it the other day and I got
it
and I can't remember but I would
definitely buy from violet boss more so
I think that's great
lisa says you just we reach to Rouge at
Sephora today just wait for your mini
brush to come girl just wait for that
now let's see how their says hopefully
someday Ulta carries all of sephora's
great brands or Sephora gets a better
rewards system at all right
I okay so I saw also that Sephora now
has like gift cards that you can rule
that you can reward your points for that
you can redeem your points for and I'm
like that's awesome because you know we
love having the cash at Ulta that's
freaking fantastic so now so far as the
gift cards but they are always sold out
how are you sold out of gift cards let's
get it together let's get together
Sephora I'm like no I don't buy that I
don't buy it okay let's see fashion girl
I think your name is Zoe I have that
right you said she can you lost the
brush I love it
Cassie says did you get your hair done
no thanks it looks good
nope just don't use conditioner that's
how I get my curly hair let's see let's
see I'm trying to just like ignore this
one because then maybe she'll just calm
down but I think I did a bad thing by
giving her like snacks and stuff when I
was doing these lives and now she thinks
that every time I sit down to do this
that she can have more like peanut
butter and stuff and I'm like mm-hmm
no no no Harriet says what do you think
about the new packaging for the death
and hell palette I figured this question
was gonna come up because I was gonna
ask a lot of questions so so morphe is
coming in to alta I think it's October
22nd I want to say it was I can love
here
I think it's October 22nd but it's going
to start and they have a lot of stuff
yeah
10:22 and then in stores at 10:27 so I'm
personally excited for morphe to be
carried at Ulta
because I like morphe I'm someone who
does like morphe I purchased a lot
myself from morphe I like the eyeshadow
palettes I have a lot of their brushes
so I'm excited for it because what I
didn't like about morphe was their
shipping ah
okay then because on the morphe website
you it used to be you had to spend a
hundred dollars to get free us shipping
and I'm like that's a lot because you
know I'm in free shipping what what kind
of world do we live in if we can't get
free shipping and so trying to hit a
hundred dollars I'm like oh man they did
lower it to $75 pretty recently I want
to say just in the past couple months or
so they lowered it down to 75 that's
still a lot of money to hit that crazy
so and then if you didn't hit the $75
you had to pay like eight dollars in
shipping and then you know everyone has
like a more fee code if you used like I
worked so hard the other day to hit that
$75 mark on the morphe website and then
I used a code and then it took it down
to below 75 and I still could get the
free shipping I was like oh come on man
like I was so frustrated about that so
this makes me pretty excited that
they'll have some of the items at Ulta
because Ulta has great shipping so and
obviously points and reward systems
because morphe does not have any sort of
reward system that I know of so I'm
excited about that
we'll see how it goes I don't know what
all they're going to put in there I mean
so far they have a lot of the eyeshadow
palettes the brushes the sponges so
that's all good stuff this is just
ridiculous
oh my goodness so I'm happy about that
but I don't know if they'll get
everything you know if they'll put
everything in there I don't really know
but we'll see about that
so I'm excited for that reason that will
be good but let me see let me see what
you guys were saying
oh yeah yeah so we were going to talk
about the the packaging with the Jackson
hell I know a lot of you guys a lot of
you guys we're going to talk about this
I want to hear your guys as thoughts -
not just mine some definitely be
watching over here I me myself I'm
pretty frustrated yeah and I'm trying I
really I honestly really tried to be
open-minded I really do
and so I know a lot of people are just
popping up on this subject and they're
so upset for me I'm kind of like really
like I don't think there's any malicious
intent I I truly I truly don't but it
kind of is a head scratcher you know
what I mean that's what I think I'm not
mad I'm not I'm not like boycotting I'm
not like you know gonna go make slander
videos or whatever but I'm kind of like
really it I I could understand it maybe
if it happened a little bit more down
the line but because it's four months I
think after the palet released I'm like
what because you know a lot of people
were were upset about the packaging and
that you know that was one of the very
first things I thought - and I got the
palette was like oh no this didn't get
so dirty and you know blah blah and then
all of a sudden it's like oh nope
they're just we're gonna change it I'm
like like that's weird and then also
about the the names on the back
everybody always wants names on the
palette everybody
Eric buddy always wants names palette so
I never understand especially when a
youtubers doing a collaboration with a
brand why you don't put names on it
because they even say it in their videos
I wish I wish this palette had the names
on it so now all of a sudden the names
are going to be on it I'm like oh no why
so I don't know and I'm not saying this
I've seen some of the comments come in
I'm not saying this is Jacqueline's idea
are like our
Jaqueline because I don't think that's
the case either I don't know let me say
that I don't know how all these
decisions come into play but I'm fairly
confident
Jacqueline wouldn't just be like hey
more food we need to switch all this up
I'm sure there's stuff that's going down
with Ultima and and Alton is saying some
things and then Jacqueline's been
putting in more fees than pudding I'm
sure there's a lot a lot that goes into
it but definitely as a consumer I would
feel pretty frustrated seeing that so
soon after the launch that's what I
think is it the end of the world for me
no because it's just makeup but I
totally get I get the frustration I
really honestly do I get the frustration
so it's just a little weird you know but
I don't know just a bummer but also you
know I did see people say that let me my
comments are always jumping around and
there's a lot of comments happening
right now but uh yeah so so Jenny said
it's a little annoying but not that big
of a deal they had to step it up for
Alta you know and that's kind of that's
kind of my thoughts too like yeah I can
be frustrated about it but again in the
big picture for me I'm not all that mad
I I just I just would be a little
frustrated so um
Katie says I just think it's weird that
the chocolate hell Paulo is getting your
package only two months up to the launch
just seems Shady why not just wait two
more months if it took two years to
release it with better packaging and
that's totally true too because it is
kind of strange it is kind of strange
Minh when you say it took two years
because you know that was everyone's
feedback you know I would like so many
videos that I watched and you know
review videos and tutorial videos people
were you know kind of complaining about
the packaging I saw some people you know
to pop the palette and things like that
and about the names and then it's like
two months later we're gonna we're gonna
change it it's like artwork but did
anyone else review the palette for you
cuz you got to think that you
think that that was a feedback initially
- so does little strange okay that's a
little strange but again I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna cry over it I don't think
that this is just me - I don't think
that if you have the original palette I
truly don't think that you should go out
and buy the new palette I really don't
because I just and I never want to tell
anybody what to do or what to purchase
or what to spend your money on I really
don't but I don't think that you would
need the exact same palette just because
the outer packaging changed because
everything inside is still the same
should still be the same but yeah I
wouldn't I
I wouldn't get another palette that's
just exactly the same just better
packaging little strange little strange
but let's see Jennifer says I'm sure
Ultimates some demands of morphe I agree
cuz you know I'm sure Ulta has said uh
I'm sorry I thought it's a diamond
I'm sure Ulta had you know certain
stipulations - I don't know because I'm
trying to think though if I've ever seen
another brand come into Ulta and have to
change up packaging does anybody know or
can you think of anything because I I
kind of have that thought the other day
when people or no it was when Jacqueline
herself said on her snapchat that Ulta
told and I think I'm saying this right
but don't like quote me here I think she
said Alta told morphe that the palette
had to change so it matched like the
aesthetics of morphe and I was like okay
and then I was like but has any has any
other brand done that I don't feel like
I've seen that I don't know and and
another thing I thought was interesting
about morphe is that a lot of times when
these new brands are coming in to Ulta
they're only being sold online and more
is going into stores I think they said
it's only like 300 auto stores if I'm
correct on that but they're they're
getting shelf space which I thought was
interesting because when these new
brands are coming and they're not
automatically just getting shelf space
but Murphy is and I'm kind of like well
how that happened so I don't know if
maybe that has a difference because the
new brands I'm thinking of like BH dose
of colors they're not in stores they're
only online so no I can't that point
that now is kind of like I tragic I
still hard I've tried really hard to be
open-minded I try really hard to see
both sides and to try to understand but
some things just kind of backed me up
like huh you feel I don't know
so let's look see oh yeah so Ryan so I
just think it kind of sucks for those of
us who waited on the marthy site while
it was crashing and said she just to get
it on launch day and now she upgraded it
like why not from day one I totally I
definitely understand the frustrations
for sure um let's see you guys are all
talking about a bracelet did I miss it
or something on my bracelet what I mean
my hair ties in my old areas bracelet
I've been I must've missed I missed
something about bracelet um I was my
constant skip around so much cuz you
guys have so many comments I'm trying to
I'm trying to read them all
oh okay let's see oh so you guys are
saying that oh let that go you guys are
saying that influencer coats are gonna
go away on Murphy is that true
how do you guys know that are you guys
know this information wait were that
were that come and go so I could ask for
so I I saw before my comment skipped
that you said someone said oh maybe it
was just okay here's let's say you can't
use discount codes on Ulta okay okay I
get what you're saying there so not the
influencer codes you wouldn't be able to
use influence your coats on the altar
website yes yes that makes sense okay
that's why I thought you said I
you said something else and I was like
we went okay um let's see Katie says yes
I thought it was weird that market gets
too drunk and destroys right away yeah
me too
I didn't quite get that Oh Mickey you
said VHS in your alte that's cool
it's not um last time I was in my Alto
which wasn't that long ago three weeks
ago or something it wasn't in my Alta
Mary says let's see Mary says as brands
create more revenue it gives them more
funds to make improvements it's not
uncommon for any business whether it's
tech resale etc to make improvements as
they grow very good point why so you
guys have beach at your I don't have
beach at my Alta maybe it's just because
I'm you know and I love we just don't
get it super fast let's see Briana says
I think they know that more food will do
well in the store I've you know i I've
done that they definitely could let's
see let's see I hate them I can't skip
around so much I feel like I have to
spend so much time scrolling up and
finding the comments again so oh you
guys can hear it and he's crying sorry
sorry about that oh I just saw someone
saying ATK bracelet you're definitely
not talking about my bracelets then are
you okay okay then come back here let's
see oh yeah good point
okay so Q says Carli bybel palette has
the same packaging in store that's a
good point yeah they didn't change
Carly's palette maybe would it be
because was was BH already at also
before but then I don't know because I
don't know I don't know guys I hate
being like don't do let's go what I feel
like that is like who's lying to us hmm
who was doing what but
at the end of the day with morphe I I
feel excited me personally I feel
excited that they're coming to Ulta
because of things like shipping and
rewards I think it's going to be a lot
better than the marquee website
I also I've been thinking that it's kind
of weird do you guys see that like four
feet or I don't know I'm not even gonna
get on message puts all those in friends
object nevermind we're gonna keep it on
up we're gonna keep it on Ulta Oh Billy
says Jaclyn has a Cartier bracelet I
think that's what they're talking about
that makes more sense you're not talking
about my area's bracelet that I've had
for four years so I bought in the
Bahamas okay I get it okay he says two
more feet coats disappearing was just
speculation okay okay okay
but I get I get what you I go to you're
saying that you can't use the the oh
maybe that's a good point though because
maybe you I guess maybe some influencers
could be upset if there's someone with a
more fee code and now more piece going
into Alta because probably more sales
will be at Auto versus on the morphe
website so there's no coach one wouldn't
get used so they could probably be
losing some money I didn't think about
that hmm
at least I says I have a feeling they'll
phase-out codes yeah that's a good point
I didn't think of that I didn't think of
that I wonder what the influencers who
have the code think huh interesting and
just an interesting okay Karen says by
the boss is going as far so we're
turning out violet boss earlier thank
you thank you so if I love us is going
into Sephora
that has me excited too I'm not gonna
lie um okay so I think that is that
everything about is that more people
wait everyone's agreeing with Nikki's
comment but I can't find think he's
comment oh here we go Nikki's comment I
heard all youtubers more vehicles were
going away because Alta said they aren't
gonna sell morphe for more than
YouTube's discount code aka not
competing
I heard youtubers market codes going
away because Altis said they aren't
gonna sell morphe for more I get I get
you're saying
yeah that's a good point
oh I mean that could have been that
could have been something that Alta said
I mean again that's me I don't know
where you I don't know where you heard
this Nicki you might have a really good
source but that makes that makes sense I
can see that I can see that for sure um
let's see
Oh so okay so a lot of you guys are
saying that you all heard that same
thing for me
where y'all hearing this stuff why can't
I hear this stuff I'm like not in on the
loop hmm huh
it's just so interesting ringing it
comes because I feel like everybody's
got a lot too
everybody's got a lot to say and a lot
and a lot on there might - so Ryan says
this is why more P isn't taking any new
influencers huh I don't know that either
the key guys teaching me everything um
interesting okay he says I've never
ordered for more because of the shipping
yeah the shipping was it was it was
expensive and yeah yeah it's not cool so
that's what Elsa has me the most excited
so let's see Ares no no okay t isn't
starting you guys you guys so we did the
live I heard Thursday you know and Katie
and I were talking Katie is my moderator
if you see Kate amore in here make sure
you click on her name she's got a
YouTube channel and she's almost to a
thousand us so let's get her there but
she's so good she's an amazing moderator
for me because I always get basically
caught up trying to scroll up to find
the rest of the comments or keep areas
off of the table but she always just so
good but we were saying that there'll be
a week where it's like completely free
of drama and trolls and just
everything's going along just peachy and
then the very next week it's like oh my
gosh we're just hit and last week we had
no issues she did no deleting no
blocking no nothing and so we're live
repent we're like ready we're ready this
week we're talking about earlier
snap or like okay okay we ready we ready
okay so did we cover everything with
morphe maybe feel like we got a lot of
got a lot of different thoughts
different feedbacks different different
frustrations people are still excited
you know there's a lot a lot going on
let's see Brandi says I also saw the
persona pellet is coming to alpha I'm
not super familiar with that one I need
to look at it a little bit more but I've
heard really good things about the
persona palette so I would definitely
check into that one I've heard really
good feedback really good reviews on it
I've seen it mentioned in other videos
so that would be cool Nicki says no
source haha just hearsay I heard from
here for the tease channel here for the
tea that sounds like uh that sounds like
good what I don't know what am I trying
to say I lost my train of thought okay
so that's where you guys that's right
guys get all your information see yes
yes yeah yeah you're doing oh then Katie
says I watch here for the tea but only
general only drama channel i watch
because for the most part she just
shares the facts without drama okay hey
I don't watch any but I hear for the tea
I will look up that channel because I
would like that I would like to be able
to find out like news but I don't really
like I don't know I think I'm too
laid-back for drama I think I just don't
I don't know let's see oh good let's
guess subscribing to Katie my connection
just went to very bad so we'll see what
happens I'm probably gonna get kicked
out here in a little bit Heather says
here for the tea does a lot of research
before posting her videos okay okay
Michelle says would Aries go outside no
she would go outside and then she would
bark at the door that's for sure I got
her to lay down on a blanket but she's
just staring at me right now um let's
see
there are any other brands Jen sells
your fuzzy on my end yet says I have a
very bad connection so we'll see I'm
sure it's probably gonna kick me out
here in a second but I thought I saw
somebody asked about Milani oh shoot I
miss to watch comments hold on I'm sorry
I'm just gonna read the comments real
quick I missed the book okay so Katie
says I appreciate the time she takes to
research her info not just a 20 to 30
minute full of speculation okay oh I'll
check out that channel
I'll see what I know thank you I got
another I love your hair tonight Thanks
it's so funny because uh this is my like
when I'm in a rush type of hair and I
don't use conditioner and I just put
mousse in it and then this is what
happens because I'm naturally wavy hair
well naturally I curved my hair for like
five years or something but so my hair
always has some waves to it and like
sometimes I get people being like oh
your hair so cute and then the other day
I had curly hair on one of my videos
last week and someone commented and
wrote it looks like you had to choose
between doing your hair and doing your
makeup makeup fun no like seriously
seriously seriously seriously who who
says things like that okay neat oh let's
see
okay yeah so we're gonna talk about
Milani next okay so I think I'm on the
Alton website but I thought Maloney was
available yeah
Milani is available online right now I
don't know if that's gonna be coming in
to stores because right now I'm looking
on the alto website and everything is
tagged with online only so again like
what I was saying with with Murphy is
that you know a lot of the new brands
that come in they don't immediately go
into stores they go online first so so
Milania is all online right now my guess
is that they see how it does see how it
sells and see if they would be able to
do you know get it on the shelf or
whatever so it looks like Milani is
available right now that the two and one
foundation concealer is for sale that's
$9.99
I heard I've had kind of mixed things
about it but I heard it was pretty good
for a drugstore so $10 for a foundation
I'm interested in that and then also the
make it last setting spray I heard that
setting spray was so good and that's ten
dollars as well if you guys are looking
for some recommendations I definitely
recommend the blushes the baked blushes
what's shades do I have a Dulce pink was
my first Milani purchase ever because I
always heard so many good things about
their blushes and then Luminoso is like
a youtube cult favorite type you know I
have that one too and that one's really
really pretty and then let's see what
else so they have the eye shadow they're
like little eye shadow palettes those
are available the amore matte lip creme
I haven't tried those has anyone tried
those from Milani I tried a metallic one
once they do have the metallic ones so
they have metallic lip creams which I
tried and I'm just not really metallic
so it worked for me
but the amore matte lip cremes I have
not tried those and let's see if there's
anything else that kind of caught my
attention I always like to try the baked
bronzer for whatever reason I just
little bronzer or so there's that they
have eyeliner saying primers quite a few
different eyeliners and the Milani prime
shield the mattifying face primer is ten
dollars I have that one it's a pretty
good primer I don't think it's my
favorite mattifying primer but I thought
it was pretty good so that's what I see
for Milani let's see a lot of you guys
are saying that you really like Milani
Casey says you're so excited for money
please oh let's see let me scroll back
up through my comments
milania's balm love the setting spray
good good let's see hey guys they talked
about that comment about my hair like
seriously like this is stuff that we put
up with I'm like oh okay
okay sure thing can you imagine like
walking up to a stranger like on the
street and being like oh excuse me your
hair today so I think whoa she for you
to do it like can you imagine doing that
I can't
I've never done that someone I mean
goodness gracious
grace oh let's see let's see let's see
Kathy does makeup over hair for sure see
Hugh says here for the teeth could be
right with her info Oprah has affiliate
codes and the pricing on their site is
higher than Ulta yeah because oh for
that Ulta huh you're right I forgot all
about that
that's interesting hmm hmm yes I am I
thinking all kinds of things let's say
Jen says their blushes are beautiful
luminoso reminds me of NARS orgasm I've
never tried that one but uh here you
know it's definitely a cult fave so
that's cool I don't know if I knew that
Luminoso was kind of like a dubash for
it dubash I've had a couple late nights
a couple late Lin oh I live Lissa's here
Lissa's Milani lipsticks are great the
liquid lapies are just okay okay okay
thank you for letting us know
Natalia oh okay lasted Natalia said
something but I hope there we go
she says the initial amore look what
lipsticks were too drying for me
personally I put the
might have change though okay and so you
say the baked bronzer is good too all
right I want to try that one let's see
oh so a lot of you guys are saying the
lip of the Milani look at lipsticks I
thought good okay thanks for let me know
that's good to know
thank you thank you but the lip but the
lip cremes aren't good people are saying
okay excellent
Oh Jen says the brow gel you want to try
from it Milani
which one let me see their brow gel if I
can find it I see a lot of eyeliners Oh
a brow no that's not a brow gel that's a
brow pencil do they have a brow gel on
here um there I think this is that the
stay-put brow color 799 that's bad
that's not bad
my mom this messaging me like crazy
because of the Cubs game okay
so let me mark I'm gonna mark some of
these things that you guys are saying so
I put them on my what's it called like
your wish list for Ulta or your
favorites and favorite it that's what
you do okay so see let's see oh okay
oh no I read that comment
hmm okay so I'm just reading some uh
reading some of the comments okay so
anything if there's something from
Milani that I've tried and I haven't
loved but I don't feel I haven't tried
out a lot from them for whatever reason
it I don't I don't know why I haven't
but oh I tried some of their single
eyeshadows those were pretty good but I
don't I don't see any on the website
like my mom one year got me there just
single shades and they all start it with
like Bella it was like Bella cappuccino
Bella some I remember Bella cappuccino
for sure but I don't see those on the
Alltel website right now let's see Gary
says the foundation shade range isn't
the greatest they don't have a shape for
me I'm pale but not that pale on me and
that stinks you guys are saying the
eyeliner is good okay I got the Urban
Decay perversion eyeliner glide on
24-hour eyeliner in my Ipsy bag and I
really really like it I thought my
eyeliner I was so excited I almost
missed it
I took my bag out but it wasn't in my
bag because it wasn't a big cardboard
thing and I did like a nun bagging on my
Instagram stories and then I went to
throw you know like the sparkly pink
envelope away and I was like what's in
here I was threw it away I would have
been so upset hello
Oh she'll says Milani eyeshadow primer
is amazing okay let me mark aren't that
one too okay okay oh and then Q says her
the eyeshadow primer is really good
Emily Noel eighty-three recommends it
excellent Ariane says thank you so much
for your consistency it means so much in
my inconsistent life ah
thanks I got a little frustrated last
week because last week was just a hard
live I was having so many problems I
couldn't get on like to start with I
could not get on it kept saying there's
an air
every time I tried to get on and I was
like what is happening and then I
finally was able to connect and it said
you're gonna have a really bad
connection are you sure you want to
continue and I'm like yeah and then my
dog was acting crazy the Cubs game is on
I'm a huge Pope's fan guys I'm a huge
sports fan I'm a huge huge club Stan and
I was trying to watch the game and I was
like someone made a really like rude
comment that actually really hurt my
feelings about like I don't know it was
just silly and it frustrated me and I'm
like you know why I'm still here I'm
still here every Thursday night no
matter what I have going on I always
turn down plans to do anything like on
Thursday nights if it's gonna interfere
with my life I don't change the schedule
up because I always tell everybody I'm
gonna be here at 7:30 CST this is what
I'm gonna do
so when someone acted like I couldn't a
have issues I mean that's beyond my
control I don't know what was going on
with my internet but then B to not be
able to be a human being
I guess then I'm not a robot on YouTube
I was like that was actually very a very
hurtful comment I don't think people
realize when they say things like that
this is not easy like making videos at
all in general is not easy being live is
not easy especially when you have
outside factors going against you none
of it's easy so I was purple so thank
you for saying that you appreciate the
consistency because I'm someone who
needs consistency in my life like I work
off a schedule you guys can probably
tell from my youtube schedule and stuff
like that like I keep on a pretty strict
schedule because that's like how I have
to live my life for being so I
appreciate that you saying being
consistent is good
I just appreciate that so I went off on
a little tangent but it's just weird
what people think that they can say to
other people and that they think it's
okay it just doesn't make any sense I
mean honestly it just doesn't um
but back to Milani so a lot of you guys
are saying the lip scrub Milani has a
lip scrub do they have it at Ulta
you're saying that the lip scrub is
really nice I don't see it oh god
there's a Grand Slam
my mom just messaged me oh man oh I
don't see the lip scrub on the opposite
website but uh let's see the chances go
it's taxed although my husband's a White
Sox fan that's funny
oh thanks you guys are being so sweet I
know it's it's it's strange I honestly I
kind of want to do a video about
comments and stuff like this I kind of
really I really want to but I haven't
figured out how I would how I would do
it yet you know what way I would do it
but maybe someday Cassie says you have a
wife as well I'll kill them with
kindness thank you
well it says you're amazing for posting
daily going live every week thank you I
I appreciate you says well we appreciate
you showing up every week thank you it's
weird because I feel like lives are
supposed to be more about like
interacting you know like and you know
definitely not as many people watch
lives on the replay which I completely
understand I still watch a lot of wives
on replay if I'm you know I'm interested
in them or I really like the person but
uh um what was I gonna see very who's
gonna say oh but so yeah people don't
watch usually my videos have around like
between four and six thousand views on
average and then the live streams will
have between one and two usually and you
know that's because we're live so I just
feel like when I'm doing a live that I
am I'm with you guys I'm chatting with
you guys and the comment said something
like you didn't even start the content
until five minutes in well yeah the
first two minutes I was trying to
explain a why I was late why my
connection it was bad that this was out
of my hands something was wrong with my
internet I didn't know what was going on
but I'm sorry that I'm not just I'm not
gonna just gonna start alive and be like
so this is what we're doing today I'm
gonna ignore everybody else who's taking
time out of their day to watch me live
not even gonna pay
attention to that I'm not gonna read
their comments I'm not gonna do any like
I think that would be just rude I feel
like wives are for this type of
interaction you know not just for me to
do a video like I would on a regular
basis because you get those from me five
days out of the week you know so I don't
see so Mickey says it's not easy
especially when you have had a long week
and you just want to chill but you told
your viewers you'll be having a video
out on a certain day yeah it's hard and
especially because like I also get told
a lot like you need to change your times
because this time doesn't work for me
and you know this time probably doesn't
work for a lot of people it actually
doesn't really work that well for me but
I just switched the day and the time not
all that long ago because I want to try
to switch it up every couple months to
try to hit certain people who do want to
come on the lives but so far I really
haven't found like from the time I was
doing last time when I was doing the
lives that don't work well for me either
but I still did it and then this time it
really doesn't work great for me I would
love to take my makeup off right now and
just be chillin but I'm not cuz I told
you guys that I'm like alive
getting all riled up can all riled up
guys stephanie says grand-slam cubs not
Cubs
I think this I mean at least they rapes
the win one game in this series because
I was gonna be really upset if they
didn't it maybe it's because I'm not
drinking an angry orchard I've been
drinking an angry orchard every game and
I'm not drinking one because I'm live
maybe I should get an angry orchard out
let's see
you guys are see thank you well I agree
to your comments thanks guys let's see
let's see let's see okay so we were
talking about Milani so do you guys want
to talk about Lime Crime because someone
asked me about them as well you guys
have a lot of sweet comments thank you I
really try my best I try to I try my
best so hard to not let negative
comments get to me too much a lot of
times I go back to my videos and read
like the positive comments to try to
like infiltrate my mind more than the
negative comments but it's really crazy
to me and I remember seeing one time a
man that insane was like telling a story
um it's kind of well that's kind of a
long one but basically about how you
know you can say all these nasty words
and then even if you say sorry or
whatnot like it still is gonna stick
with that person and it's so true I just
wish people would think a little bit
more before they just say some of the
things that they say I understand you
know given the opinions constructive
criticism and all of that but some
things are just downright rude and
disrespectful and then we sit here and
we think why why do we have so much hate
why is that happen why'd all these you
know one of these things happen right
why is there so much bullying why is
there this bizarre that it's like what
it's like we didn't deal that every day
every day I get called the name every
day every day and we wonder why you have
puppies but it just it's just really
mind-boggling to me mine puzzling okay
so okay so some of you guys are saying
is lime-cream coming to Ulta I guess I
haven't seen that myself
but people were telling me today that
that lime-cream is coming also so has
anybody verified that or did you see
that somewhere because I I don't know if
I just missed it or what but yeah when I
was asking today for suggestions so Zoey
use of gun crime shocked me so yeah I
don't know when because I even tried to
search lime crime on the Alpha website
and I didn't see it in like you know
morphe still says coming soon and I
thought there was another brand that I
saw that it was coming soon but now I
can't remember or not Milani start here
I don't even know what I said Murphy
okay he says you saw that Lime Crime in
the what's up and makeup group okay oh
and then though you said you heard it in
the beauty minute okay so apparently so
yeah so Lime Crime coming to Ulta you
know I've never heard just anything from
Lime Crime and I almost did it was a
couple years back and they had some sort
of like weird thing happened I some
maybe like credit card information got
stolen or something like that and then
the owner didn't handle it very well or
something so it kind of scared me
because when I hear like things with
like credit cards and confidential
information that obviously scares me to
to not order I know you guys have been
asking if I've gotten the tart toasted
palette yet you guys know I was super
hyped for that one and I haven't because
tarts website was doing something a
little funky
and I don't I'm not I just can't do that
I mean like addresses were being emailed
to other and I loved her first one of my
favorite brands I was so hyped about the
toasted palette and I was like no I'll
just wait I'll wait for it to come to
Austin or Sephora because I don't need
my address and my credit card being
emailed to 50 random people to just do
which wrong with it like I don't know it
just brings me out I was like no I can't
do it I can't do it when I hear things
like that I'm like you don't know no no
can't do it
so that's why I didn't from Lime Crime
and then yeah then I heard something
funky was going on with the owner I'm
not really sure what all was happening
but I decided to not not make a purchase
at the time but now that really calls
out to me I guess from the brand there
there was like a lipstick that I wanted
to order for a while and then I didn't
but um but yeah I guess not much really
caught my attention and maybe it was it
going into Ulta you know maybe I'll feel
a little bit like safer
or whatnot - uh so order but I don't
know I've just never really felt the
pull what do you guys think what do you
guys think what do you guys think um a
lot of you guys are saying that you
haven't either things things aren't
calling out - and you says you don't
trust Lime Crime I think it says I agree
with you Sam I will get it when it comes
in stores yeah like because I was gonna
buy the tart toast it right away but
then you know the morphe 35o 2 came out
and i ended up getting that one in PR
and then my friend Liv sent me the Kat
Von D Saint and sinner palette so you
know I'm trying to use that one and I'm
trying to use that one and so I can
review it and stuff too so I'm like
maybe it's a fine if I don't get it
right away and I can you know try to
take my time so I really want to get you
know a lot of these holiday reviews up
so I'm like maybe it's okay if I just
wait until it comes and I have so much
Ulta points like Ulta cash buildup that
it would be really nice to use it there
so I think I'm just going to be waiting
because by the time I finish getting
some of these other palettes you know
really tried and tested and so I can
have my reviews out like I've that
palette would just be like sitting
around so it's like why why buy it right
away so I can you know just have it sit
there for a bit so I'm still planning on
getting it i n I'm just gonna wait till
it goes into author Sephora so says the
brand doesn't called for me and Q so I
was only interested in the Venus
palettes oh yeah yeah I remember those
I've ever seen those yeah Jen says I'm
getting the toast Apollo and arrives in
stores see you seduce us I love the I
love color so lime crimes down my alley
hopefully it's out in stores I hate
ordering on him personally because you
guys telling coupon is on eBay totally
random but like I do a lot of motors
online a because
like I get inside here when I have to go
home places look like large cracks Oh
going to the law is like torture for me
but I'd like to use Ebates to get cash
back and I bought a on the other day for
like an event here in town have $5 that
guy was like cool I didn't know fruit
found was on you bathe I just kind of
casually typed it in there like I'll
just see totally was I was like yeah
always says the owner has a bad
reputation in the industry talking about
lime crime um oh you can get lime crema
on Amazon Prime I don't know if I knew
that I was interesting oh let's see
Elizabeth says are you gonna review the
prism palette I didn't get that one I
put it in it will everybody know my son
I I didn't think I was gonna buy it and
I still haven't bought it I just don't I
don't know I just didn't call out to me
and with all the subculture stuff and
then Prizm gets released right after
that I'm like who what where when why
but I will have my video for tomorrow
will be a first impression on the saint
and sinner palette and then also be
Becca a pray glow ski palette I want
some I drew that again so I have that I
have a st. Center on my eyes and then
the backup fella on my face so you'll
see some first impressions and
tomorrow's video I'm super excited about
let's see
oh no Elizabeth says dude group on have
a problem recently I don't know did they
I feel like everybody always some sort
of powerful like gamma man let's see
okay so that's yeah so lime-cream
I feel we're all kind of for the most
part wait am i blurry this is usually
when I when YouTube kicks me out is when
I go boy I feel like we have la vecina
thoughts on lime-cream
Ryan so slim trim is okay it's not a
standout brand to me personally
yeah so I don't know I don't know if
I'll be drawn just because they'll be at
Ulta I don't I don't think so
but let's see Oh Jen says I'm clear on
your end that's good I don't know why it
looks like I'm blurry on my end okay so
did we talk about the three that we were
going to morphe morphe Milani
Lime Crime I think we're not all of them
that I was going to talk about that's
pretty good um I know I see some people
asking me about what I think about
morphing the John Hill palette this
video will go up as a regular video once
I get done with the live and we
discussed that in the first what was it
like 20 minutes or something we just got
that first right away so if you want to
you know see my thoughts and I tried to
read comments from other people to to
get some more feedback and stuff that
will go up when the video goes up as a
replay but yeah so I think we touched on
everything the Venus and the Venus 2 are
pretty good from Lime Crime car so yeah
so I think we got everything covered
that actually wasn't too bad 52 minutes
I'm terrible I guess that's careful um
so yeah I think I'll go ahead and wrap
it up here so I think we got got through
what we wanted to get through I did a
live chat Thursday nights at 7:30 CST so
I'll be back here next Thursday night
too and I do a poll on my Twitter which
is at by Samantha March I do a poll
usually on Tuesdays and asked what you
guys want to see for the Thursday lives
and have you vote and then I do the one
that's most voted on if you guys have
any suggestions too if you would want to
comment them like when this video does
go up as a regular video if you would
want to comment on that video that way I
can see the comments because our chat
that I'm seeing right now that goes away
once the live is over so if you have any
suggestions for what you'd want to see
in lives I would always love to get
ideas because sometimes I'm kind of like
running out of ideas of what to do for
the live each week so you can let me
know it in any of the comments or tweet
me or anything like that so I can put
them in the
fools and see see what wins each week
but yeah so like I said I'll have the
Kat Von D and the Becca
video up tomorrow and then I will have a
bonus video on Saturday I'm gonna do the
office tour now that it's been all
painted and stuff so there will be that
um yeah other than that I'm gonna go get
my angry orchard I'm just watching this
Cubs game doesn't doesn't look too good
but I'm gonna go ahead and see how this
game goes I hope everybody has an
amazing Thursday night thank you guys so
much for coming by the live I appreciate
you all so much if you're watching on
the replay thank you so much for
watching I hope you guys have a good
night
and I'll see you in the next one I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
