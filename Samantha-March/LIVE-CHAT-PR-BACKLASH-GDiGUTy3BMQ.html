ah do you want to let you guys know that
as I was getting on this live I got the
whole you might experience a lot of
streaming issues with this live do you
want to continue so it might be one of
those nights where YouTube kicks me off
every five minutes because that happened
a couple weeks ago and that was really
frustrating so that was a bummer to see
that message so that might be happening
tonight alright so how is everybody
doing happy Thursday welcome to another
live stream did a little bit of a
different setup with this live stream so
I actually have my laptop right in front
of me hey Kelly I also got everybody oh
yeah I should probably find my own live
stream so I can look at the comments I
don't know why I forget this every
single week hey Melissa so I'm so bummed
I hope I hope everything goes okay and I
don't get kicked off a ton because that
was so frustrating to me last week so
hopefully that doesn't happen okay so
all righty um like I do every week I did
the Twitter poll to see what you guys
want it to to chat about to this week
and this week we're going to talk about
a PR backlash in the beauty community
and just kind of have a discussion of
why why there's so much maybe like anger
towards PR or or why I feel like I need
to like preface to say like where this
idea even came from but sometimes you
know I I can speak for myself to tell
you which which comments kind of bum me
out like on my videos I did a makeup
monthly it was the one I posted last
months and not the one that I posted
just last week but that makeup monthly
someone commented and said something
along the lines of it's just was really
disappointing that almost everything
that you reviewed in here was products
that you received in PR
and I was like I don't really get it I
don't understand why that's an issue
because maybe I could have seen it if
like everything that I mentioned in my
favorites section would have been PR
like maybe I could have understood that
but I mentioned in every single category
I do sales I do products that I think
are ok and then I do favorites and I had
PR mentioned in every single one so I'm
like hmm I'm a little confused as to
what that this means because that's kind
of like I feel like that's what I'm
supposed to be doing right I get here so
I can review it I don't get PR so I can
just be like hey got this not gonna tell
you about it though mm-hmm no no not
gonna tell you about it so I was kind of
like I don't understand
and then like another comment that came
in on my morphe 3 if I go to review
video all it said was uh I just can't
with PR and I'm like ok because it it
just seems like there's so many so many
issues with with PR getting P are being
on PR less you know are the reviews real
you know things like that and you know
it just it made me wonder a lot but then
kind of what also sparked my curiosity
on this is that a couple weeks ago on my
snapchat I posted a book and you know
said oh I got this book in PR and all of
a sudden I was getting a bunch of snaps
in like why do you get books in PR who's
sending new books and all these other
things and in addition to doing YouTube
and beauty videos I'm also a book
blogger and a published author I have 5
published novels and I started a book
blog in 2009
it's called chiclet plus it kind of
started us just like a woman's a
lifestyle blog but over time it kind of
morphed into just a book blog but I do
book reviews over there and author
interviews and I were very heavily in
the book industry book marketing editing
proofreading all of that stuff
but one thing about being a book blogger
is
that I get books to review it's the same
way with makeup and beauty beauty
bloggers get sent those things to review
you know it's kind of on the same same
level there you know when offers and
publishing houses are sending us books
they're expecting us to review it
they're expecting to put it on our blog
they're expecting to put it on their
social media they're expecting us to
influence other readers and people who
are buying books to buy their book same
thing as the beauty community you know
what I mean so I was like hmm okay this
is interesting when people are
responding back and they were saying
things like I didn't even know book
bloggers were a thing you know some
people were saying that and some people
were saying I didn't realize that they
got things like free books and things
like that so I thought would this be an
interesting topic to talk about because
maybe one of the reasons people get
upset with PR is that they're just not
aware that that it's kind of a common
thing across a lot of different
industries so I just you know kind of
mentioned this on my snapchat and I was
like would anyone be interested in
seeing this as I left chat because I was
getting back so many interesting snaps I
was a screenshot and like a crazy person
and and all these things and so I just
thought it could make for an interesting
topic another thing that I thought was
interesting was that when I was talking
about it on my snapchat and I was asking
people you know why do you think that
there's PR backlash in the beauty
community what are your thoughts what
are your opinions for the first like 32
snaps that I had back it was the most
common answer was jealousy which I
thought was very interesting and even
some people who wrote in on snapchat
they were like you know I understand it
though because you know I can get get
jealous too when I see it I just don't
you know make hurtful comments towards
people
which I thought was interesting and
shoot I lost my lift no I had made I'm
grown out of the list oh man and then I
changed my setup all around now I can't
find my list shoot um but I remember so
I know they don't see I remember tell us
see was the thing that got brought up
but people also talked about how they
think like PR hauls and stuff on can
come across as very braggy especially
when there is titles people seem to
especially take offense to titles that
had the amount of money that someone was
receiving in PR people were were pretty
upset over videos like that because they
felt like it was bragging or you know
kind of showing off to their subscribers
you know things like that so those were
some pretty common ones so but I mean I
would love you know I can see that the
comments coming into I would love to be
watching them and um you know seeing
what you guys are saying but I don't
know I just thought maybe you could make
a interesting interesting topic but like
I said one of the things that I thought
that I thought was interesting when we
were talking about book blogging was
people saying that they didn't realize
the perks that book bloggers could get
and I thought that maybe this video
could also kind of help bring some
awareness to other people to kind of see
that the the beauty community isn't
really all that different from a lot of
other industries you know what I'm
saying and this list I do have right in
front of me but it was so interesting
getting back some snapchats and I would
love if you guys work in a certain
industry and you get something like PR
or goddess or you know just certain like
benefits or perks I would love if you
would drop them in the comments so we
can see them but I I was so frustrated
because before I was getting ready I was
reading through the screenshots that I
took and because I was gonna read the
screenshots out loud and then I was like
duh you film lives off your phone you
can't read the screenshots so I just
kind of
we brought things down but I had people
on snapchat in the restaurant industry
you know talking about being sent to
food shows and having their flights and
hotels paid for you know being able to
be invited to all these banquets and
things like that people in the real
estate industry we're talking about kind
of the perks that they get their doctors
offices wrote in or people who worked in
the doctor's office work in the some of
these things were so interesting that
I've never even heard of myself but one
girl wrote in says she works on the
genetics side of vegetable seed and she
gets flown all over the country to view
like different fields and things like
this I mean just like fascinating things
I was like I didn't even know that was a
I didn't know there was a thing and you
know and these people who work in their
industries and have you know probably a
passion for what it is that they're
doing they get these certain other perks
to someone who said they work in the
metal industry like railings and and
fencing she said we get a ton of PR we
get tons of stuff sent to us sent on
trips the floral industry I mean I said
that in my snapchat I said I used to
work as a travel agent that's actually
what I went to college for my
associate's degrees in travel and
tourism and I worked for a short time as
a travel agent because I realized I
didn't actually want to be a travel
agent I just wanted to travel you know
but the perks that travel agents get are
insane like just free trips they can
bring on their husbands or their you
know their spouses their kids they get
to go on these free trips and visit
these resorts because the more that they
know about the resorts you know such as
like like a Sandals or something like
that the more that they know about the
resorts the more that they can then sell
them to their clients who will then book
the vacation who will go to the resort I
mean it's really just like there's a lot
out there and so what was interesting to
me is that what I was saying in the
snapchat too is I never saw in the book
community for so many years I never saw
anybody get upset with me or fellow book
bloggers for receiving something
like free books and I've gotten more
than just books in the mail the other
day I got a bottle of wine with one of
the books like I've gotten wine I get
close you know I've been sent places
like Las Vegas to do book signings like
things like that there's a lot of other
things that I have gotten for being a
book a book blogger and I've never had
anybody ever in the eight years that
I've been a book blogger I have never
had anybody tell me that I had that one
of my book reviews was biased because I
got sent the book never never have I had
that it's saying I have a very bad
connection it's probably gonna kick me
up but you know it was things like that
that I just thought was so interesting I
have never been accused of being biased
because of getting free books I've never
been accused of any of that and so I
don't know so I just thought it was so
interesting coming over into the beauty
side of things and doing something that
I consider to be super similar to what I
was doing in the book community and all
of a sudden all of a sudden I'm not a
trustworthy person because I get PR or
my reviews aren't legit and all these
different things and I'm just thinking
what what now so I don't know that's um
that was like a really long preface of
course but that's kind of just
everything of where the idea came from
and why I wanted to make a live chat
about it and because I really do I would
really love to see you know what you
guys have to say too because like I said
there were so many interesting comments
on my snapchat that I was just like dang
this is I'm just super curious and I I
think a lot of people have a lot of
different opinions and you know
different ways to see it and I guess one
thing about YouTube and to me and the
beauty community and things like PR and
things like that
it's never been something that's made me
mad ever and I don't know if that's just
because I'm coming from something like a
similar background but I remember at
first starting and just seeing like
comments like not even on my channel in
the beginning but like on other people's
channels and I'm just like why is why is
everybody so mad I was lost I to be
honest I'm still kind of lost but I
would it just really caught me off guard
to be honest like it really caught me
off guard the only thing that I could
recall like people getting mad at me
about my book reviews is that you know
they didn't agree with my review you
know they didn't agree with this
character made me feel this way well it
made them feel that way that's when
people would get mad in my book reviews
but no one ever was mad at me for
getting the book I mean you guys ah at
this point in time and probably for the
past handful of years 100% of the books
that I review my book blog were sent to
me from an author or publisher like my
review schedule is so full I don't get
to read for leisure anymore I'm honestly
always reading for reviews so a hundred
percent of my blog is PR but no one's
come after me saying that I'm not on it
like it is I'm just like hope right now
um so let me try to find my comments
here and see people are saying
okay so I try to start from from the
front and from the beginning and a lot
of people a lot of people again are
saying things like jealousy which sucks
like that sucks
I don't know what else to say that man
it's just a bummer and it's kind of like
if like pure jealousy green-eyed monster
will get you every time I mean there's
that's what a lot of people are saying
um it's just a it's just a bummer
because I don't know I guess if
something to me I'm like if something
makes you mad and you don't like you
don't like watching what it is that
you're watching or while you're doing
and all these other things like why do
you keep watching like I don't know
watch something else that's kind of why
I think a lot of people are saying that
you do have to work hard to get PR
that's very that's that's very true I
mean I can remember like my first PR
packages one of my first big PR packages
from like a bigger brand was from Sigma
Beauty and I still I have this bench in
my office if you follow me on snap it is
sitting on the bench but the bench looks
up and you can store things underneath I
still have my first like physical box
from Sigma and the note saying you know
like you hope you like these products
and stuff I kept those because it was
such a big deal to me and I thought it
was so exciting and like I get excited
and just like so pumped when I see PR
but then it's almost like I feel like I
can't be excited about it because people
are gonna be mad at me and I'm like but
you have to work really hard to get
notice it's not it's not easy
he's like it's not easy I feel like it
should be celebrated I feel like when I
get PR or when I get something like a
sponsored video I'm so proud of myself I
can remember my first sponsored video
was with a Scandinavian I did like a
bridesmaid makeup tutorial I'm using
their sprays I was so proud of myself
you guys I had still not realized how
bad it was in the beauty community and
how how look down upon sponsored videos
for I was like this is a sponsor 30 of
us got a neighbor like Jess I was like
going crazy I was so excited in that
video and everybody was like oh you're
just saying that because they're paying
you like no but these sprays I still
have this first like I was so excited
about it and and you know I don't want
to say everybody I hate when I do that
when I'm like everybody was doing this
cuz I was so not the truth but I was
like wait no people actually don't like
those but I was so proud of myself like
to me I base like PR and sponsored
videos to me that's like to me that's
like you know someone like in the
regular job or in the corporate world
like getting like a bonus or a promotion
or things like that you know what I'm
saying like I would be like proud of my
friends but other people are like oh
nope not to do it and I'm like I like
everyone thinking it's such a bummer and
I know a lot of people there's a lot of
talk about like beauty bloggers not
disclosing like sponsored sponsorship
sponsorships and things like that and I
mean I don't get the app money because
I'm still pretty small but all the ones
that I do I mean I'm so proud to say I'm
still because I will not not be proud of
getting a brand's attention so hard that
they actually want to pay me money like
that blows my mind to me and I'm like
this is a sponsored video by so-and-so
like what up I'm so excited about it I
love it but it's like I I can see where
beauty bloggers probably don't want to
disclose because you typically get lower
views on those because people don't want
to support I mean literally people say
that people have said that to me I
didn't watch that video because I knew
it was sponsored and I didn't want to
support it I didn't want I didn't want
to have my view I didn't want to have my
adsense if you were already getting paid
for that video people have said that in
my comments I've seen it in other
comments too and I might so why do you
think beauty bloggers hide their
sponsorships I mean obviously but why do
you think they do because people are so
mad
I'm like I'm not saying it's right I'm
not saying they shouldn't because you
should not do that and it's the law you
have to disclose that but it's like when
people try to like skirt around the
issue like oh this this you know what
I'm saying I don't want to be mean but
when people state around the issue of is
it a sponsored video or not and you have
to like search through through their
description box to find out that it
really is it's because there's backlash
against those two and it shouldn't
always be that way yeah okay I'm gonna
go on somebody rants and I'm gonna get
out of breath so many times who Jackie
says dream job is to review books are to
write one honestly my dream job was like
one of my dream jobs was to write books
and I thought I needed to chipping in
the industry and that's why I thought to
start a blog and it changed my whole
life I mean my whole freakin life
changed because I made that decision so
if there's ever anything that you think
about and you think that there's some
sort of way that you get in that
industry I mean you just got to do it
because you just never know okay let's
see okay this is an interesting comment
sue says people mistake sponsors for PR
I see that a lot too I see that a lot
too when when you have when you get PR
gifted to you because I've had people
say like in my Instagram comments like
I'll do you know I'll do a tutorial with
some items or whatever and people will
say in the comments
is this sponsored this seems sponsor if
it's sponsored I'll sell it or say it's
sponsored I'll say it's an ad or
whatever it is again it's a law so you
have to say that but something is not
sponsored if it is sent to you in PR
it's sponsored if you're getting paid to
to make a post on it like I have a
recent post on my Instagram is using the
pathology sheet mask that is stated in
there that is an ad from pathology
because they did pay me in exchange for
making that video which is awesome
because a lot of pathology so that's
super cool but you know that is
sponsored not just PR and using products
that you get
ERU you can pick and choose what you
want to review put in your videos using
your tutorials if it's sent to NPR
unless you have some sort of like a
sponsored you know agreement in there
but PR and sponsored videos are not the
same let's see okay okay let's see seven
e says free makeup means they value your
opinion not your positive opinion if
they only want positive feedback than a
shame on them I wish I wish I could
figure out how to make a video because I
almost shared this on my snap the other
night and I was like nope that's
probably not the smartest thing but
there can definitely be some shady
brands out there like brands who who
want to send you things but they put
straight up in there we want you to
basically say that you bought this
yourself like don't say that you got in
PR don't say it's gifted cuz we wanted
to look organic and I'm like girl bye it
was like nope
no but I remember it was just earlier
this week that I saw that and I was like
you are not really asking people to do
that are you you're not do now I do that
oh my gosh and I'm like I hope no one I
hope no one I hope no one said okay to
that cuz - Shay
so I mean there's definitely show you
companies out there don't get me wrong
there definitely is um but you know okay
let me see oh I don't know why I'm not
using my mouse hello Samantha would be
so much easier okay um let's see gosh I
feel like I missed a comment or two in
here
oh it's just so crazy how many people
are saying jealousy huh
and so one thing I haven't seen I'm
gonna be really behind on the comments
because there's so many in here and they
just keep getting on on some roles yeah
Vicki says being a review channel is way
too expensive I'm not trying to buy
every new release to review for your
channel to please your viewers you'd
have to sell foot and a leg and and your
soul especially with YouTube to
monetizing videos because ho-ho
this girl can't make a video without
immune disease but I know it's been
hitting other people pretty hard and
unfairly now it's my turn I can't do
anything right I think we're just so
frustrating but it's true you know and
even when I started like reviewing the
books and stuff I was born a little
library and like every week because I
can't just go out and like buy a ton of
books so I was going into the library
and you know there's not really a whole
ton like that for makeup but I actually
know people who buy or I don't know if I
should say that nevermind moving on
sometimes lives are bad because I can't
I can't censor myself but um okay let's
see Melissa says it's common across
industries for sure fYI I get free PR
from natural hair products and makeup
it's like I'm trying to watch the
comments that are coming in like right
away but then I'm trying to watch all
the comments in here Emily says I think
it stems from a huge mistrust that
influencers will not be honest about
products because they want to continue
receiving PR and I he says what could
you possibly be doing how your videos
you monetize I mean I'm talking every
single one holiday giveaway holiday hits
and misses my make up monthly top 17 at
2017
oh my will I buy a video oh you do
madami um so and I definitely think that
that's an issue
and the hard part is is that like I I
honestly feel that way too there are
some people who I used to watch on
YouTube that I just stopped watching
because I kind of got to the point where
I was like I don't know and you know my
advice is that they're there honestly is
probably going to be people out there
who maybe aren't the most rude I mean
you know it's just there's bad people in
the world obviously there's bad people
in every industry obviously like I mean
there just is and I think I think like
what what I do is that if there's
channels that I don't think that they're
being honest or you know things like
that I unsubscribe and I stop watching
like that's it that's all that I can do
I don't understand how me going to
someone else's channel and just calling
them a bunch of names because maybe
they're not that's the thing we don't
really know unless they say that which
probably they're not but I mean you
don't really know what's going on in
someone's head and but if you have that
feeling and if you feel like the certain
youtuber has done whatever it is that's
upsetting you just stop watching them
that's like my biggest piece of advice
why go around and just keep spreading
negativity and bringing more negativity
into such a negative world anyways just
stop watching move on watch someone
support someone that you feel like is
truthful and honest because your
subscription will mean a lot to them
your views will mean a lot to them your
comments will mean a lot to them that's
what will mean a lot to them so if
there's someone that you think isn't
truthful just move on from them move up
that's my best like my biggest piece of
advice um let's see
but then it's frustrating it is
frustrating because you feel like
there's you know probably a few bad eggs
and then they give a lot of other people
a bad name and that sucks because
there's people
who me and a lot of other people that I
know in the YouTube community that are
very honest that are you know they just
have a passion for this they love what
they're doing and they want to keep
doing it and then they post a PR Hong
all the sudden it oh you're lying and
you're making things up and you just
want to be on this list and that list
and be friend it's like huh it's such a
bummer
honestly it's such a bummer um see
oh so Monica says I think some people
see all the PR stuff as bragging not
just for me but for everyone I don't
personally think that but that's my
viewpoint yeah and that's what a lot of
people on when I was screen shopping a
lot of people were saying that too and
because some people I remember in the
the screenshots I was looking over
people are saying that like people
complain about like having to clean up
boxes and stuff and I'm like how I don't
know people were making comments about
and I've personally never seen this
myself but um about having to clean up
the boxes or people like throwing things
like like oh I got this phone case cool
next like that's people were making
references to that in my snapchats and I
I could totally see how people would
think that that would come off in a
really really wrong way so hopefully
people who people could think of that
and not do things like that again I've
never seen that happen um but I got
quite a few comments and that about you
know people don't like if I hate the
throwing it um I I can totally see how
that would rub people the wrong way like
you don't like you don't care about the
items that you're seeing so I'm like oh
no like so that was another big thing
people said um Danielle says I don't
have a YouTube channel but when I
blogged more I used to get a good bit of
natural hair products to review and post
and post on Instagram I blog and
Facebook
this kind of says I only get annoyed
when it seems as a few tubers aren't
grateful I think it's awesome if I could
get free makeup and products why not you
know great that Jen says don't always
get PR to the same influencers over and
over they should spread their products
around I feel like definitely the micro
influencer trend is definitely becoming
bigger micro influencer I don't remember
the exact flows like exact
specifications but kind of typically
just like smaller channels like under
100k or 100,000 and things like that but
I mean I feel like more brands are
getting into that because you know I'm
still a smaller channel but I feel like
I'm getting more from from really
exciting brands I mean Matt Kevin Nick
qualm Charlotte Tilbury I I think that I
think that the micro influenced your
trend is definitely up there and I feel
like I'm seeing more people to get get
PR from more companies once with smaller
accounts which i think is awesome I
think that's super cool I hope more
brands do that because I I think that's
great I especially hate when people
complain about thoughtful additions and
their packages and good product proofing
that's a good point
um I think I missed something about
takis video this is how far back I am on
the comments and miss something about
touchies video I'm not sure what video
she did a Samantha says I'm a flight
attendant in hello free travel I used to
want to be a flight attendant was ill
that was really cool let's see I think
an issue with PR is the excessive
amounts that companies send like every
shade of the foundation or stuff that
has nothing to do with the product or
makeup that's a good point that's a
that's a really valid point I get that I
remember I got a package from Mac a few
weeks back and they were kind of
promoting there it goes this is it the
skin thick line kind of promoting in
that foundation like they sent along the
foundation brush and things like that
and then they sent along a gift card for
the value of that of what it would cost
to get that foundation and so they go so
you can go and pick out your exact shade
and I did I remember doing the live PR
haul and I was like that's really cool
because instead of sending you know
every single shade out there you know I
get to go pick my shade I was like but
that totally makes sense to me and I'm
just as happy getting a gift card to go
buy my foundation shade then you know
getting the whole box like I'm I wasn't
mad a little slightest you know I guess
a good thing you know I what am I trying
to say I could see how it'd be nice like
if someone is like a makeup artist you
know I know a lot of youtubers are like
working makeup artist that could be
really awesome for their kids they're
like you know giveaways and things like
that or like donating to like women
shelters I think is really cool and I
hope I hope I hope a lot of people do
that because I think that's really
awesome so that kind of stuff is cool
but I totally I totally understand that
you know sometimes I can kind of seem
like it can seem like a lot for sure
that's a good pose a really good point
let's see
who are working at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and
I get gratis Oh jealous I want to go to
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works tomorrow awesome no I
think the amount and the title makes
people feel bad because some people
including me save our put money aside
for more luxury products I totally get
that talking about like the PR how's
that state the exact amount of money
that I got in PR I have seen a couple of
those videos floating around and for me
I just don't watch them because that to
me - that just kind of like weirds me
out
it weirds me out when people you won't
really say anything along those lines I
don't know why I don't know why weird
something out but it does um so for me I
just don't watch them so I don't know
but it would be hard because I mean jeez
I mean I still can't really afford a lot
of fantastic things out there so when
you see like that exact amount of money
I'm like loo like I don't really get
okay well hold on he's gonna try to come
up on the chair okay but yeah um yeah I
totally can get that oh no I got open
then I got a cramp in my foot oh it
hurts so bad
oh okay let's see Jen says I don't see
house as breaking because they put their
time and effort into making all those
videos that get them to the point that
they can get PR and be invited on trips
yeah and I think a lot of people I think
I don't even want to say a lot yeah that
says I have a very bad connection again
yeah sorry if I get kicked out the thing
have a bad connection a very bad
connection
I'm sorry YouTube I'm sorry you don't
like me but I think some people don't
quite realize everything that has to go
go into having a YouTube channel and to
growing a YouTube channel as well it's
it's not easy and then what has to come
with being on social media and all the
negativity and the pressures and all of
that like there's a lot man
and so and it's not you know you're
never guaranteed money like I was just
saying with the YouTube to mine to
monetizing videos you know it's a it's
not the most financially rewarding and
so it's so helpful like it's so
extremely helpful to be able to get PR
you know when you can't go out and buy
everything um ah shoot I just was gonna
say something yeah forgot um dang it
oh I was gonna say because um another
thing that I find really helpful about
PR is that I also don't know if people
realize like for me and being at my size
my size of channel I get asked now
nearly on a daily basis I mean it has to
be almost daily that I could ask have
you tried this brand what do you think
about this brands lipsticks what's the
finish like on on this blush what's the
best highlight from this brand and I'm
like I don't know like I don't know I
haven't been able to try all these I
haven't been able to buy everything it's
super challenging because like it's like
you're expected to have an answer and
you can't have all of the answers so
then when you do get items such as PR
it's so helpful because then I can feel
so much more confident in answering
those questions so that that's another
really huge part to me and having PR is
just being able to try and test things
or you know
sometimes on my snap people will say hey
I'm considering buying this matte
lipstick I remember saying seeing that
you have it can you spot it and show me
the swatch
yeah I sure can I'm happy to help like
you know it's things like that and again
you just you can't you can't buy
everything you're just can't so um let's
see Oh MERIS house I wish it yes see I
wish I guess good seer is she's located
right now Oh Alice says I work at an
animal shelter and can adopt for free
that is I did not know that I did not
know that that's so cool
that's awesome
look at that see I mean there's when
when people are economy on my snapchat
about working in the metal industry and
the genetic side of the the vegetable
seed I just was so fascinated by all
these different things and and you know
all the different different perks and I
think one thing too that people forget
about YouTube who compared to like the
more regular job is we don't get sick
days and health insurance we have to pay
self-employment tax which is super-fun
love self-employment Dex so you know
it's things like that that I don't think
people realize either so so when you get
a box of makeup it's so much more no
pock the makeup you know it's money that
I have to pay towards my self employment
tax quarterly that I have to put towards
that and not having to buy the makeup to
review to my channel you know what I'm
saying like it all it all comes around
guys so um a 70 says many industries get
free things it's just so different with
makeup I guess because it's so personal
because it's beauty Jen says have I ever
been offered to go on PR trips and in
the beauty industry no but like I said I
was sent to Vegas a couple years ago to
do the book signing so yeah and like my
husband works in a corporate setting and
we were both sent to Orlando I know it
was yeah Orlando we were both sent to
Orlando on a trip maybe three years ago
or so through his work amazing trip it
was fantastic it was wonderful I mean it
happens in so many it's just it happens
to across so many industries and that's
why I just I really really hope that
this video can maybe bring some some
awareness it's just some awareness that
people know that you know it's not all
bad it's not you know I feel like some
people
some people pinpoint brands and say like
these brands are bad because they're
doing this this type of marketing and I
just I simply can't agree with that I
mean not every it's so hard I I try
really hard not to lump everything into
one thing because that's just not the
case like I said earlier there are some
shady brands out there that want you to
do some weird things and I know that but
I don't think that a brand is ever bad
because they I don't think a brand is
bad for utilizing influence or marketing
because that's that's who has the
influence right now one thing so like I
mentioned earlier I'm a published author
I've always wanted to be a writer I've
always wanted to write a write whether
it was writing books writing articles I
just I just love writing and so when I
was younger magazines magazines were the
big thing I wanted to be a magazine
writer so bad and I would research and
study about you know what it means to be
a writer what it means to be a magazine
editor and all these different things
and one thing that I learned and you
know this was several years ago so but
one thing that I learned is for things
like fashion shows editors and writers
for fashion magazines were being sent to
these fashion shows for free very
similar to you know what what you get to
see now with social media back then who
had the influence was magazines and so
foo got sent on trips and who got sent
free things and who got sent all of this
and this and this it was the magazine's
their writers and the editors because
then they were writing the articles and
saying this is what's in this is the the
this is the brand that you should be
going forward this is you know all of
that the photos everything because they
have the influence so they were being
sent on the trips times have changed
social media is the is where the
influence is now so who is getting sent
on trips and who is you know getting to
have all these opportunity
it's the influencers because they are
the ones that are influencing and so I
don't know if people realize that
because I probably wouldn't realized
that if I didn't know so much about the
magazine industry from years ago because
I wanted to be in it
you know I applied to to a ton of
different magazines when I was younger
and I researched the industry and that's
what I found so I totally understand
where people are coming from and saying
like the trips are bad too those trips
have probably always happened
you just didn't know about it because
social media wasn't around it was a
different time back then
but now because social media influencers
have the influence I mean you're even
seeing the brands like covergirl
Maybelline they are having influenced
their social media influencers sign on
with their brands because that's who
people are watching you know what I'm
saying does I hope that makes sense um I
just I hope that makes sense and again I
think it I think it comes down to
awareness and and maybe by making this
video and by saying these these things
maybe I'm saying something that some of
you don't know and maybe I'll give you
something to think about and you know
things like that but I just think it's
interesting because I just I can't get
mad at at going where the where the
influence is and you know for me being a
published author when I'm about to
publish my book I go to the beauty
bloggers especially you know I try to
make sure I'm hitting beauty bloggers
that I have really high social media
numbers because they're going to be the
one that has a lot of influence you know
of course I don't I try not to leave
anybody out I try to balance everything
that I'm doing but I'm going to the book
bloggers so I don't know if I said
beauty but I'm going to the book
bloggers and saying here is the copy of
my book
I hope that you review it hope that you
put it on your social media because it's
gonna help me sell books and that would
be great
I mean it's the same thing that that
that brands are I mean you know you know
what I'm saying I'm going to the people
that have influence to help me sell my
book I mean honestly if I were to start
like a cosmetics company I would be
doing the same thing because that's
where the influence is I hope some of
this is making sense I really do okay
let me see let me get back in comes
Starbucks partners I get free bachelor's
degrees from ASU free pound of coffee
per week free food 20 to 40% off cell
service and free premium Spotify
accounts I did not know any of that
that's pretty amazing oh wow free degree
and that's a good point too because my
friend who works in the corporate side
of things she is oh it's Kristina here
yay um she works on the corporate side
of things and she is getting she is back
in school right now doing classes to get
a degree and I'm like I'm still paying
my student loans still paying student
loans right here I've been out of
college for a bajillion frickin years so
that sucks so yeah I mean certain jobs
you have you have all these different
you have all of these different perks
across all these different industries
and when my friend came and said yeah
they're paying for my schooling I wasn't
like did you deserve that though do you
deserve that
are you sure are you lying are you lying
about why you're getting that I mean you
know what I'm saying it's just
industries have different be free bash
that's yeah man I'm still I'm still like
jealous over that man free powder coffee
per week free food 20 to 40% off
self-service I mean it my husband works
in the corporate industry we get a
percentage off of our cell phone bill
every month because of his job
mostly that's why I wanted to work at a
college free school my company pays for
school to see like it's great hello yeah
that's so cool the makeup girl next door
says I think almost every job gives
people some sort of perk discount free
stuff etc if you don't like seeing PR
house and you don't have to watch you
have control and what you click on to
watch that's so true I don't even drink
coffee I drink like coffee ish I drink
like ish okay but that's true you know
uh you hear about a lot of different
perks across a lot of different jobs I
mean my friend who works in IT I don't
even want to tell you how many computers
he has don't even want to tell you don't
even want to eat um let's see my friend
is in the fertilizer business seriously
he goes all over the place to evaluate
places for best fertilizer it gets paid
to create the best for their particular
soil and sod grown that's a good point
too I know we had a friend who worked in
the feed business I want to say it is
and he was always off on these trips and
sometimes he gotta bring his wife some
of the times too he got to go on great
great trips you know um Jordans here hi
Jordan I'm in the military we get
military discounts yup my family is
military as well and you know they give
discounts in a lot of different areas
which i think is awesome um Jackie says
why did you like the travel industry
that's so far behind him uncommon um it
wasn't that I disliked the the travel
industry I just uh I wanted to travel I
didn't want to send people on trips I
wanted to go on the trips and it would
like make me mad every time I'd booked a
trip for someone I'd be like I wanna go
with it that's okay that's okay
let's see Mariana says great topic Sam
thank you I appreciate that I hope I I
you know I hope that we get to make some
like really small difference I really
hope so um let's see somebody says I
wonder if a car salesman get free cars I
mean that's good point though to bring
out car salesman's because I think and
you know I can't say this for sure but
um you know that they get like
commissions and stuff and I mean
Realtors get commissions and stuff and I
I can say this with 100% honesty I had a
friend once trying to sell me a car that
I should not have but I didn't buy but I
shouldn't have bought but I knew he was
pushing for and Mitch knew tube so I
wasn't Mitch at the time we knew he was
pushing for it because he would have
made the better Commission and I'm like
I'm your friend bro
like what are you doing like but you
know there are industries out there
where people do get paid commissions and
are they always honest I don't know but
maybe go to a place where you feel like
people are being more honest it's just
like you know it's the same thing in
every in every industry there's always
going to be those bad seeds in every
single industry but you can't punish an
entire community for you know this
little many number of people it's just
it's it's not fair it's just not fair
it's not right y'all know okay let me
see ah oh no no my comment skipped
around oh man I was so far behind - oh
shoot oh shoot where are you come on
come on
God let's see
you don't get paid an hourly wage for
4pr so I feel that's a way of paying you
that's very that's I mean yeah that's
true
um shoot - where was I at Nicole sighs
are you able to dispute when YouTube
monetizes your videos yes and dispute
them all and it's okay like I know I

not gonna make like as many videos or
like things like that cuz they're gonna
do monetize I'm like I don't care I'll

lot away but don't you can't I don't
think that you're supposed to sell fear

me go down any further um so let's see
oh my gosh I'm all the way back to when

really strongly about I hope that you
will come back and say it on the the
regular video I do want to say because I
see I'm all the way up here and I see a

getting good ideas too and other good
insights and I think this is really this
was really helpful to me I hope it's
helpful to some of you guys too I hope
if you're watching on the replay I hope
that it's helping to join in says my dad
used to work in a sales industry and
they take care of their clients like
paying for their meals taking them on
vacations etc it's a part of every
industry it's a fantastic point amanda
says I've seen you basically cry when
opening and reviewing PR so you're
either a great actress or you're
genuinely moved it does it's I mean I I
I still I cry a lot opening boxes but
even like just me just me and my husband
talking I cry just talking him and
telling him things and and I kind of
want to cry right now because I get kind
of choked up about it and you know and I
thought maybe of putting this in the
life pull to but to have a live or even
just a video of just talking about all
the good things about social media to
because I did a video a couple weeks ago
talking about the pressures of being on
social media and I felt like it was just
kind of like a negative video you know
talking about all the bad things there's
so many good things at the same time and
I really want those to be known -
there's so many good things I
I mean I've started doing this I started
doing being in social media you know
what is it eight years ago I would not
still be doing this if you know I didn't
love it and I didn't have a passion for
it it it has honestly it has changed my
life and has you know led me to having
all of these friendships I mean you know
I'm over here talking about Katy being
my friend and all of this and I have so
many friends that I get to talk to on a
daily basis and it's it's just it's so
amazing you know there's so many good
things too so I felt I was and it was
hard because we were having like a crazy
winds that night and I think it was
affecting my internet connection and at
the end of that video I was trying to
explain like but there's a lot of good
things too like it's not all just bad
and I'm not super sad every single day
because there's all these great things
and YouTube completely cut me off it cut
off like the last five minutes of that
video and I was like no no I didn't want
it to be so negative
um so much line says what is your
thought on selling your PR on eBay or
Poshmark once you're done reviewing I
don't think that that's really I mean I
guess I don't know if there's like hard
and fast rules but I would think that's
a no right I mean that's just me I don't
I will not reap resell PR I would only
sell items that I personally bought
myself um but I guess I guess selling PR
just sounds weird to me I you know I a
lot of things that that I get in PR that
I don't use myself or if I get a lot of
uh you know a lot of one product or
whatnot like I love putting them a
giveaway so it's so freakin helpful
because I try to do as many giveaways as
I can across all of my social media
platforms which is a lot of them and it
can get really really pricey so to to
have PR and to be able to put in those
giveaways is so so helpful um but like
if I've used just some
thing you know I wouldn't give that away
but like my niece is you know now into
makeup and I like to uh I like to send
her things or like just other friends or
you know giving things to friends my mom
you know things like that um but I don't
think selling is I don't think I guess
I'm not someone who would do that and I
don't know I guess I don't think that's
right in my opinion but that's just my
opinion I don't know if there's like
hard and fast rules about that but let's
see
okay I'm just doing your comments I know
we're almost about an hour so I probably
will have to wrap this up pretty soon
here okay so my guys are answering
questions on some of the things um so
let's see huh so yeah like I said
there's just there's so many good
comments in this live chat I just I
really encourage you to once this video
is up I hope that you will come back and
leave some of these comments because
they're just so interesting to me I'm
just I'm so happy I feel like I feel
like there was a lot of interaction
tonight and I'm sorry I know I wasn't as
a as into my comments as I usually am
but it's like when I'm really passionate
about something I kinda like get on a
roll and I can talk for a while but I
appreciate all these comments so much I
think that's awesome I hope you know I
know I said we're at the hour so we'll
have to wrap it up but I hope I hope
some awareness was was brought to the
table tonight and I hope maybe I just
hope it helped in some way it's so it's
so hard to see oh my husband's company
takes us on amazing trip every year plus
we get other perks and trips and all
kinds of awesome things that's awesome
oh shoot
Roberto says what do you actually do
with packaging from PR like the crazy
ones with video screens well I'm a
hoarder so I keep everything I don't I
don't know what everybody else does but
I basically keep everything one of our
bedrooms looks ridiculous and my husband
brings it up a lot and I'm like I know
but how do you get rid of some of these
things like I can't do it almost uh says
our sales team gets gifted baseball
tickets and other sporting events
because that's where business happens
I'm incredibly jealous of that
incredibly jealous of that I love
sporting events love to do that I'm also
says they do it in sports but then again
beauty is sensitive it's true ah so many
good comments we're gonna hospital I get
free soda on my birthday
lol I just may look into Bath &amp;amp; Body or
something yeah I used to work out uh one
of my first Jobs was at like a what I
want to call it like an events venue for
concerts and they did like hockey games
and stuff like that so I got these free
concerts free hockey games think even on
nights that I wasn't working cuz like
when I was working we could you know
come out and watch and things like that
but even on on the nights that I wasn't
working I could still get him for free
and go to concerts since he shows
comedians the hockey games free food all
of that it was fantastic
Oh summer says I was a model there's
definitely perks true that Melissa says
Mary Kay has always sent their top
beauty influencers and sales executives
on trips you have to earn it but you
still get to take them yeah it's true
there's so there are so many there are
so many perks in so many different jobs
in so many different areas you know it's
just I feel like it's just making
awareness to it I think is a really big
thing so
Joe says for sure sending PR to YouTube
booty influencers is the best marketing
strategy for brands if I own a brand I'd
spent a fortune on PR I totally agree
with you and it's like you know like
celebrities who go to what am I
translate with the award shows you know
they wear the dresses and then they
shout out the designers and you know
things like that um you know it's all
it's all relative if we think about it
most of us Samson your book to zoella
what if she don't like it no I'm just
kidding um well I will have to look her
up Oh Chris antha says PR is definitely
not cheap especially when you're a small
indie brand she is a small indie brand
yes yes I totally I get it I don't know
how you do it
I mean I've so much respect man so much
respect okay I feel like a zoella okay
I'm gonna write that down write that
down okay got it
um let's see it's so hard to because
you're talking about honesty because
like sometimes for me it's like you give
your honest opinion but then if like
like for me like I'll give my honest
opinion but if it doesn't match up with
like other people's opinions then I'm
being told I'm not being honest so it's
like do you want honesty or you want
what you think or do you want us to
follow up nor because you know
everybody's gonna have different
reactions to everything I mean
everything is so subjective so it's like
what I get I get frustrated when one
sometimes I'll see like oh you're not
being honest about this because you know
this person didn't like that product but
like what do I have to be like that or
you want honesty like
I'm able to tell you sometimes I can be
pretty frustrating oh I love so many
comments I'm talking about Christina
with the lipsticks and your guys
ordinary soap so cool that's so awesome
she Christina and cosmetics have
typically always linked in my
description box to like under my
discounting and coupons and stuff I
always have her website linked to a lot
of you guys are saying you get
percentages off your cell phone bills
you get free schooling you get discounts
on satellite and so service oh my
goodness Megan says I work for the
government no free perks there oh girl I
used to work for the government
oh yes indeed
hey it work there oh and so many things
like say many companies and their
employees for free education my
grandfather got to do his PhD was sent
for was sent by the university he taught
at see it so it's just it's so it's so
interesting i jo says i get free demo
cleanings and fillings cuz i work at a
demo clinic not very exciting hey that's
not bad although those good some of
those i'm sorry i'm run they can run
expensive you know and if I wasn't
married you know luckily I'm married to
someone who does work in a corporate job
so he has health insurance thankfully
but like to have health insurance when
you having to like pay for health
insurance without being with a company
that's expensive because I look to
before we got married and it was a big
part of like why I didn't go full-time
with like books and stuff until after I
got married just cuz health insurance is
so expensive
it's no joke my neighbor works for a car
company and he brings home a different
car every month Oh
so I'm going to ask where my books are
all of my books are on Amazon eBook and
paperback you just let's search 8th
March and they all should pop up ok so I
think I'm getting through most of the
comments here but I know never I'd over
an hour I know I gotta go I gotta go um
but I'm so glad thank you guys so much
for showing up to the live chat for
leaving so many amazing comments I
learned a lot of information oh cool um
