welcome to another live chat I need to
figure out what lighting I'm gonna roll
with tonight hi everyone
okay welcome to a new a live chat where
I'm going to be doing a Sephora vib sale
anti haul I'm just gonna try to figure
out the best a spot to put my little
tripod because I want to be closer to my
laptop than I was last week but then my
lighting is a little funky so does any
butter I don't really know okay I can't
put my ring light like exactly where I
want it oh okay
we're just gonna leave it there where
does it only with our color good so
sorry sorry if the lighting is a little
funky but I really wanted to be closer
to my laptop now that I'm doing the
lives in my office versus the kitchen
because like last week I was more this
way but my laptop is still over here and
I kept having to ah it was a disaster
happy Thursday everybody how is it going
okay so like I said I did my Twitter
poll in the Sephora vib sale in toy Hall
one out by like 54 or 55 percent so
that's what we're gonna be doing tonight
I'm just going to be chatting about some
items you know specifically found out
Sephora that I will not be purchasing
during the VIP sale which starts
tomorrow I still do not have my cart
fully ready I keep watching more videos
and I keep adding more items I'm like
stop just just stop you're good just
stop so that's why I'm gonna do um I'm
excited I haven't done an anti holo on
my channel it's such a long time I used
to do them pretty frequently but I
stopped doing them you know I do my will
abide series every Wednesday and I you
know I just talk about new makeup
releases and if I'm gonna buy him Renaud
and I felt like it was pretty similar to
the anti haul and I don't know sometimes
anti hell vibes just
I just thought like wasn't feeling it so
but I figured it could maybe make for a
fun live chat so that's what we're gonna
do so I have a little list here that I
will go through or you know if anybody
if you want to throw me out any
suggestions and you know if I see
something that I know that I'm not gonna
buy it I can chat about it too so I
really wish I could make my lighting a
little bit better but where's go after
well at least my highlight on the side
looks really good right gotta find the
positives in every situation right okay
so let's see here I do have honey candy
I do have my dog right here if you hear
her whining she typically freaks out for
the first like ten minutes of a live
because she's like you're doing
something different I need to be
involved and then when she realizes I'm
not gonna give her attention she'll go
lay down so I apologize if you can hear
her for the first couple of minutes but
she should she should just lay down
eventually
hey I hope so okay so oh I also I
haven't even found hello so I get it
together I need to find my comments as
though I can be responding to everybody
I do apologize I always forget to take a
I forget to take a thumbnail photo but
like literally I'm about to pop on a
five minutes and I'm like oh no a
thumbnail so I'm you know I don't have
to make up that I do in the thumbnail I
apologize
it'll be in Saturday's video but I
really didn't have anything else to
throw up here so I was like shoot you're
cute okay so how's everybody doing all
right so first item that I decided that
I will not be picking up from the sale
is the Too Faced the new peaches and
cream or peaches what's it called just
peachy velvet matte eyeshadow palette
there we go
so it's $45 I decided I'm not gonna get
it and you guys might know that I
haven't been a big fan of two-faced for
a while now I've just been kind of like
not been feeling them when I was doing
anti hauls on my channel I was always
mentioning to face because they're
always coming out with
products but I'm like nope nope nope not
doing it and I actually mentioned them
in a will I buy it I believe not too
long ago because I said that I was
actually somewhat interested in this
eyeshadow palette so but I decided not
to get it and you know because I've been
watching the reviews on it and honestly
I've heard pretty positive reviews so
it's not like I'm not saying that I'm
not buying it because it's a really bad
palette or anything but I think that I
just decided that I simply don't need it
I have a couple other eyeshadow palettes
that are in my cart right now I do of my
wishlist and recommendations video up
and I talked about quite a few other
eyeshadow palettes that I want to put on
there and then also a lot of people kind
of compared it to the sweet peach
palette from Too Faced and yes the sweet
peach well from the Too Faced and I have
you know I have that one too so I was
like do I really need it like I just
don't feel like I do so so so I'm not
gonna get that one someone made it to
the live stream she decided that she
needed it to be involved so I decided
that I'm not gonna get the Too Faced
peachy matte palette I just don't feel
like I need it that's a real that's the
only reason I do hear good things about
it who was who was getting it who's
getting it I just decided it's not gonna
be for me so one it's for that and also
the foundation the new like peachy
foundation or what not I decided not to
get that either I do have a couple other
foundations on my list so I decided
against that one again I'm hearing good
things like I'm actually hearing good
things about the Too Faced peach
collection but I'm not gonna do it I'm
also really upset because I was thinking
about getting the hooter the flow filter
foundation and sorry I wish I could make
my lighting better and I was thinking
about getting that one but like every
single shade is sold out
including mine so there's that so right
now I have the do your one that I talked
about in my wishlist video I have that
one but a lot of people said it was
really good so I'm still debating it
still still debating I'm so Dana asked
random question but it's drunk elephant
products worth it I don't know if I've
ever tried anything from drunk elephant
I don't off the top of my head I can't
recall anything that I have so I'm not
for sure but I would not be a picking
anything up I will not be picking up
anything from drunk elephant either I
talk to myself actually out of quite a
bit of skincare and I feel like every
time the sale rolls around I'm like I'm
gonna get all the skincare and it's
gonna be amazing and yada yada yada and
then I'm like I have so much skincare
like I need to focus on what I need to
use up a skincare wise so I'm not gonna
get anything from drunk elephant I did
talk myself out of the the belief asset
let me look that up so I can get the
exact name I think it was called like
the Holly Jolly hydration set it's in my
I picked one up for my holiday giveaway
and I was like I'm probably gonna pick
this up for myself too I had it in my
cart for the longest time and then I was
like why would you get this because you
already have so much skincare where is
it is it this oh yeah there it is
hello it's only $38 which I don't think
is a bad price and it has the true cream
moisturizing balm the Hungarian water
essence and the moisturizing eye balm I
balm sorry and but I was like no you
can't like I can't just keep filling up
my bathroom with more and more skincare
it's just like it's just it's just
silliness at this point so I talked to
myself out of the belief set and drunk
elephant Sunday Reilly all of that I've
talked myself out of all of it so okay
so let me see
where was I she is now she's now
sleeping on the chair if you guys follow
me on snapchat and I always show her
unconcerned on the chair I can't believe
that she just fell asleep up here that's
crazy
so she's sleeping and I just had an idea
of where I could move my light to have
better lighting but now I'm too afraid
get up you know it's like having a
sleeping baby on you and you're like no
I have to pee but I'm not giving up
that's what's happening right now so so
I will probably have to have bad
lighting the whole time but I apologize
I'll get it figured out one of these
lives
I'll get it figured out and that's what
happens when you move rooms so okay
we're worried I'm just gonna scroll
through my comments here so we talked
about some skincare wait where's the way
I went too far
um I'm not gonna get anything from
colour-pop at Sephora I know a lot of
people are really excited I live here
yay hey Liv do you go to Hawaii tomorrow
cuz I'm really cold so I would like to
go I'd like to go somewhere warm oh my
gosh it's like jealous
oh jealous I am so good I really
just want to go put my big sweatshirt on
but I was like no try to look somewhat
presentable and then you know the
lighting I should I just put my big
sweatshirt on yes packing your suitcase
please please let's see Katie says is
the Stila glitter set with the new
formula there's six in the set with only
one shade that's a repeat I don't know
if I know what that one is the Stila
glitter set with the new formula like
like without the glitter in it is that
what you mean because I saw that Steel
is coming out with ones that they're
they look just like the glitter and glow
eyeshadows but they don't have glitter
in it I think that's very interesting I
don't think that I would need it though
I don't know if they're available if
they're out yet because I think I found
them on the Alltel website the other
night but it just said coming soon so
I'm not sure if they're on the Sephora
website yet but I wouldn't get it myself
I just that's another thing I just I
don't feel like I would need it let's
see
neighbor says I like that ulla
Hendrickson better than a drunk elephant
I've been really trying them a lot too I
have a lot of like minis and samples and
a bunch from that brand that I've been
trying to get through and I'm really
really been liking a lot from them I
know I have a cleanser that I've been
using that's in a green bottle I've been
using like the truth serum they're like
transformation moisturizer I've been
really impressed really impressed with a
lot from that brand - let's see um I
guess I could look at my list - um so I
also put on here just like any of the
Buddha Beauty eyes shadow palettes I'm
not gonna get any of those I know a lot
of people are recommending the desert
dusk for the sale but like I just don't
want to do it I think there were $65 I'm
just I'm just not feeling it I just feel
like there's other eyeshadows that I'd
rather get and they're so like there's
just other food a product that I want to
get like I said I wanted to get the
foundation but it's not in my shade
right now um Amanda and Singh was
wearing her a pair of her lashes in her
Halloween video where she did three
different looks and I had to pause the
video on rewind because she didn't link
it in the description she just like kind
of held up the lashes real quick and I
was like no go back go back
what lashes for those and I believe they
are the feral lashes so I just added
those to my car but for some reason the
Hooda eyeshadow palettes just like does
not they just do not call to me either
the two big palettes called to me the
four or is it four or six mini palettes
that she's about to come out with I
think they're like $27 for nine shades
or something they're doing nothing for
me so I like her lashes liquid lipstick
I would try the foundation but for some
reason for some reason her eyeshadow
palettes just do not call to me so
I got asked with my finger tattoo means
it means to write in Latin because I'm a
published author um let's see have I
checked out the new zoo a foundation
there's you I saw look Sephora I don't
actually know that answer um I have not
I don't really gravitate towards you
away very much okay Joey has an asshole
that's for us I didn't think they were
but I want to make sure I haven't I
don't have a lot from she way it's just
a brand like I don't dislike them or
whatever I just don't gravitate towards
them too much so I did get asked about
the tatcha I did film the my holiday
review video today and it's gonna come
or it's gonna be posted on Sunday and I
do film the I do review the Tasha set
that live said to me live while you're
trying to give him a bath Tasha because
I like the lot of products in there so I
will have a review for the cleansing oil
the like rice enzyme polish I think is
what it's called
what else was in there the water cream
live can I do I'll just send you the
bills every time I try to buy the butter
cream you know that'd be great and then
also the dewy skin mist so I have a
reviews for all of those coming up but
really liking tacho so that's fantastic
okay let's see here oops
really comments just skipped around
there's a lot of comments tonight I feel
like we have a lot of people on more
than usual let's look at me yeah look at
me okay let's see let me try to find
where I got left up okay here we go
Brittany says I need a good eye cream
one from Sephora would be that belief do
you like eye balm that's oh do I have a
pull-up still not you the one from
belief I've been using that at malting
and night but I've been using it at
night a lot and I think it's really
really good I totally recommend that one
let's see
so she'll Bell 76 us thoughts on Pat
McGrath pals and Natasha didn't own a
palette the Pat McGrath palettes I'm
definitely not getting because Pat
McGrath is just out of my price range
she's all about price range at the
moment so yeah so she has the mothership
two eyeshadow palettes there's sublime
submerse Avance of liminal are these
thumb ones that Sam Ravenel had in her
yeah they are right
how did she did like a couple tutorials
with the palette and I don't know if she
I think it ended up like she said that
she liked the shadows inside but like
she wasn't very impressed with like the
packaging I think I think these were the
ones that she was I watched so many
YouTube videos all day all day long
sometimes I get a little confused over
who I watched and who said what about
what but I think it was a Samantha Robin
doll who was using them the other night
and you know they're 125 dollars for one
that's just like
that's too much for me you know let's
just do much room I guess
and then like I kind of think the same
thing about the Natasha's you know no
pellets because I had I put her big
pellets on my anti howl list if I do get
anything like right now on my loves list
I have her 5 5 pan eyeshadows which are
still which are still expensive don't
get me wrong but so let's see like her
holiday ones she has two different
entices those are $48 or there's one
that has a couple purples and golds like
one of her regular ones that still the
$48 for five is still definitely very
expensive but I think I would rather go
that route then doing the 129 yeah the
129 for the bigger palettes like the
Lila palette and the sunset palette so I
would definitely not getting Lila or
sunset even in the sale just not doing
it but I'm seriously considering either
the I think it's the Eris pellet the one
with the blue in it or one of the
regular ones it has a couple different
purples in it because I really enjoy
wearing purple those are the only ones
that I would consider getting from
nataschab de Nona because I just can't
it is can't do much for me okay let's
see let's see let's see
Omega send my brows look good today
thank you this us one side of my face is
really popping the other side of my face
not so much but you know the side of my
face really poppin kinda it's gonna go
along with my video tomorrow I have a
challenge coming up tomorrow I'm very
excited and also very devastated to
share okay
okay um some more on my list okay I put
a Smashbox trio on here
let's see because I was I was kind of
looking at this one I clicked on it a
couple times myself and then I was like
no that's you should not buy this one
Samantha so this is called the Smashbox
drawn in decked out shadow and
highlighting palette set and it is $39
so it has it's a set of palettes
featuring three different highlight
shades and sixteen on trend i shadow
shades you get a travel sized spotlight
palette in Perl which that is what Casey
Holmes did the collaboration and I have
that like I have the full size so like
why would why so and then it also has a
full size cover shot action appellate
and ablaze and then a full size limited
edition cover shot palette and sultry
and I don't know why I got so drawn to
this set because like I said I have
pearl but then I bought one of these
cover shot palettes because they came
out with like seven I bought one and I
returned it so like hello and then I got
another one and I'm going to return it
or I'm going to declutter it when I do
my my eyeshadow palette declutter so I'm
like I don't I don't like those cover
shot palettes they just didn't do
anything for me
so hello so I don't know why I was like
so drawn to it I'm not really positive
but uh no so I will not be buying the
Smashbox set I would say just just buy
the highlight palette on its own because
that highlight palette is definitely one
of my favorites so there's that one oh
yeah did we talk I think I mentioned
that I'm not gonna buy anything color
pop I'm definitely not none of the
palettes that are coming to Sephora with
color pop are really doing it for me and
I think those are hammers II again so
that's what I think I thought they would
be a little cheaper I guess but that's
okay because you can get like the hooter
palette for 27 but then the color pop
out it's 26 I'm like don't feel like it
was that much of a difference right I
don't know maybe that's just me though
oh let's see
um infinite midnight says what do you
think about the urban decay little vices
Lipsett I am not sure I haven't seen
that one so let me pull that up okay um
another ellipse up that I did have on my
anti howl list is from Anasazi Beverly
Hills the her Minnie liquid lipsticks I
think she has a set of three mini lips
that are out I've seen a lot of people
because like I'm currently obsessed with
watching all the recommendation videos
and I've been seeing a lot of people
recommend the set now a lot of people
but I've seen people recommend this that
is what I'm saying and I do not like the
Anastasia lipsticks I think I've
decluttered all of them well I just
they're not for me they're too thick to
moosie to like drying and cracking on my
lips I don't I don't really like him at
all so I would not be getting the
Anasazi aside or even any of the liquid
lipsticks okay so I think this Urban
Decay set the little vices lipstick kit
it's $25 I don't think I would get this
one just because I feel like I have a
ton of lipsticks right now and do I have
any lipsticks in my car I do I have the
huda beauty mini her nudes collection
it's four mini liquid lipsticks from
Judah and it is $33 for all four I
really enjoyed the hutu liquid lipsticks
I have like four of them or something
now and I've just been waiting for this
nude set to come in I think it's a
really good deal because I think
regularly her liquid lipsticks or twenty
dollars do you get four minis for thirty
three which I have a couple of her minis
and I've never ran out of one and I feel
like I wear those a lot and they come
traveling with me quite a bit so I
wouldn't get this Urban Decay set and
like I see a really dark purple in there
I see a red I see kind of like a funky
purple in there just colors that I don't
gravitate towards a ton so it wouldn't
make sense for me but I do like the
Urban Decay two lipsticks um I have my I
have one of the shades right here in
1993
and I think it's really I think it's a
really beautiful lipstick and I really
really do like this formula if you like
a regular lipstick so if you're
interested in trying it I do think sets
are a good way to try things out but I
do like the Urban Decay lipstick formula
I just don't personally need that set
myself okay feel like I'm talking fast
but I'm trying to get through everything
no jacqueline says hi from Iowa hello
it's cold here not not very pleased oh
I'm so Priscilla said what about the
Chloe
Morello eyeshadow palette I did I had
that one on my list too for the anti
haul that one is with a sea otter London
so Chloe Morello is she an actress do I
have that right I think she's an actress
I know she's done a collab in the past
and now she also just did another collab
I think I'm I'm pretty sure I anti
hulled her first one in the past two and
I wouldn't do it I wouldn't buy it again
during the vib sale I'm not super
familiar with a CIT London and I I don't
know Chloe oh she's an australian
youtuber see i thought she was an
actress not not very well informed so a
lot of times when I'm buying
collaborations and such like I you know
I kind of have a pull not every time but
a lot of times it's because I have a
pull for the collaborator or I really
like the brand and obviously we can now
tell that I don't know very much about
Chloe her hello
why did I think she was an actress is
there is there an actor that has the
name is Wu I don't get that much don't
watch on TV but I'm not super familiar
with CIT London I've never tried any
other eyeshadow palettes and I do have
one of their lipsticks and I like it
quite a bit but not enough to be able to
buy it so I will not be giving that one
let's see okay I should have grabbed a
drink my goodness oh okay
Oh a lot of you guys are saying that you
gave yourself budgets for the sale
that's a good idea I should give myself
a budget do I want to give myself a
budget I really I don't feel like I'm
gonna go all that crazy though because
even though when I did my wish list I
felt like I wasn't uh I felt like I
wasn't I didn't have as much as I
normally do which was good but then I
started watching recommendations video
you know what I did the other day I was
watching a recommendation video and all
of a sudden I added like a one hundred
and fifteen dollar rush to my loves list
okay I did that I took it off I took it
off let's talk about that then I did it
oh my gosh I've always heard about this
Tom Ford brush like I've heard other
people recommend it and then someone put
it in their hope let me search brush
someone put it in their recommend or up
there either their wish lists or their
recommendations now I can't remember
what it was
I've been watching somebody videos but I
was like I was like I'll just add it to
my loves list it was late at night I was
like I'm just gonna add just add it at
it at it and then the next morning I
woke up and I was looking at it and I
was like a 115 dollar brush when I'm
sure loves this girl get it together get
it together
it's the Tom Ford bronzer brush so it's
$115 I mean it looks like a very nice
brush but nope I took that one off
I just I didn't even I didn't put it in
my card I was just adding things to my
loves list but I didn't even
I took it completely off my love so I
was like you got to get it together
girlfriend you know I get to kill her
so I'm not gonna get the Tom Ford dress
maybe another day maybe another time but
uh no now this one okay let's see
yeah so someone asked if I know what
time the the sale goes live and someone
actually sent me that today - I really
don't know uh I don't know that hates
her I just assumed maybe it was like
midnight because I remember the altar 21
days in beauty was at midnight but I
don't know if this one would be at
midnight - I'm like still trying to mess
with my life I don't know why I just
don't give up okay so a lot of you guys
were saying midnight that's what I
assumed and then it was like well what
time zone I'm like oh I don't know I
guess I just typically wake up in the
morning and shop and I guess I've never
had an issue so I don't know let's say
midnight
PST maybe I won't stay up for it you
know I am a Rouge so I get to like shop
first cuz I'm so fancy but I've never
had an issue with something selling out
like in the morning or whatnot but I'm
bummed because things are have already
sold out and I don't know if they're
going to be restocked or they're just
not even gonna bother to restock during
the sale as the hooter foundation which
I'm kind of bummed about but oh well
what do you do um let's see maybe you
find my comments again so Lucy says are
you picking up anything from Tom Ford
you know I don't think so I don't own
pretty sure I'm saying this correctly I
don't want anything from the Tom Ford
brand and I think it's just it's just
one of those brands that's too pricey
for me you know so I really haven't even
looked at a whole lot whole lot of items
because I think they're just gonna be
too pricy
okay let's see we're talking about Sato
I did add the Shiseido like the facial
Cotton's or something I've been seeing
those recommended quite a bit as well I
don't know I didn't think it was that
bad I know they're in my card let me see
you want to see what they are I think I
was only like ten dollars or something
like that but I mean it's for combat so
you know the Shiseido facial continents
ten dollars and you get 165 sheets it
says an extremely soft gentle way to
apply a liquid skin care products bushi
so I think I'm gonna get those okay but
someone mentioned they should say though
curler eyelash curler I have that and
I'm pretty sure I got rid of it I don't
like it but I also don't like eyelash
curlers so I don't get them I'm not
gonna lie I don't get them they pinch my
eyes they don't do anything to me so I
don't know there's that and I said what
about the Sephora favorite set I feel
like I've talked myself out of so many
of those before our favorite sets like
I'm just like a boss over here like no
no no I feel like it's so hard doing the
vib sale in November because I've
started buying you know Christmas
presents for my family members and we're
thinking about all of that trying we're
a military family so I always try to
think around the holidays like can I
make it down to visit my family I'm in
Iowa there in Alabama like can I go see
them all these things and then it's like
be I be sad by everything and I'm like
so uh I don't know there's that but I
had they give me more lip on my list
forever like for ever and I talked about
it I think I couldn't will I buy a video
and I was like yes I'm buying that and
then there was all these issues like it
was there then it wasn't there then it
was there again that's not there and I'm
like he kind of just lost
you just lost me it's $68 I think it's a
really good value I really do
it's $68 you get like an AVH lip gloss
Bobby Brown do your hooter tart I mean
there's a lot in there that I think
would be really cool but I'm just like
no I don't need it don't do it
$68 for all these lipsticks I just I
just I don't need to do it myself right
now so I'm not gonna do it but I think
it would be a good value set if you guys
are thinking about it or thinking about
trying out some of those I think it
would be a good deal or you could go for
the give me some nude lips if your nude
lip lover like me $28 and there's six
different minis in there that's a good
set that I think I can do the big set I
just kind of talked to myself out of can
you guys can hear her snoring she's on
my lap my dog I don't want to say her
name crystal wake up another one that I
thought was pretty good it's called the
Sephora everyday must haves it has like
the brow wiz if your shade is medium
brown it has a Beauty Blender the
benefit hoola Kat Von D makeup forever I
mean it has a bunch of different stuff
in there and it's $75 I personally don't
need it myself but because I have almost
everything in here but I think it would
be a really good deal if you want to try
out a lot of these products I just don't
mean it myself
let's see the sephora favorites the lash
sash is $48 you get a bunch of different
mascaras and then also I think it's a
pair of poodle lashes I wouldn't need
something like that because I don't
really do a lot of mascara I don't do a
lot of mascara cuz I mostly do false
lashes and so I had another I had the
Lancome monster big a mascara on my anti
howl list as well because I've been
seeing a lot of people recommend this
one too and I wouldn't buy that one just
because I wear lashes so much it's kind
of silly for me to uh
by a bunch of mascaras so I'm not gonna
do that okay I am I'm gonna try to move
my light really quick it's probably
gonna wake up my dog but I'm just gonna
try to move this light real quick BRB
okay I don't know if that's gonna be any
better at all but it's just like driving
me it's like driving me crazy I don't
know if that's better or worse
so the sephora favorites no and nothing
really called out for me in the favorite
sets i know i've seen some people ask
about perfume
I'm not a big perfume person either I
tend to forget about it quite a bit
I've gotten a couple of scent birds
which are those like smaller containers
and you can get like scent you month
there or whatnot I've gotten like three
of those though I've only used up like
one or two I can't remember but I always
have one of those in my purse and then I
have three perfumes sitting on top of my
desk and at Sears that I constantly
forget to use my perfume so buying
perfume for me is not a good a good idea
until I use up other ones I cleaned my
room today and throughout two perfumes
that I can't remember the last time I
touched so we're sitting on my
nightstand I'm like when did you use
these last but they do have the perfume
sampler which is $65 and it has a bunch
of like minis and such and they will
have a certificate in there
and you can go like so so you buy this
that you get the certificate and then
you can go into Sephora and redeem it
for a full-sized product that came in
that set like that's a fantastic value
for your perfume person I would totally
recommend doing that because then you
get to try out a bunch of different
items and such and find the one that you
want to have the full-size in so
um like there's a skincare set that
would probably good for $64 but I just
want it needed I mean there aren't
there's a couple of skincare sets
there's like haircare ones but there's
just nothing that's really calling my
attention right now that I feel like it
absolutely have to get so I don't have
any of the sephora favorite sets on my
love's list or in my cart at the moment
and I think I'm gonna be okay I think
I'm going to be okay okay I do have the
tarte toasted in my cart finally so I
will be getting that one but now all of
a sudden I'm hearing like terrible
reviews on it what happened there was a
all these good reviews and now all of a
sudden there's all these bad reviews and
everybody's telling me I shouldn't get
it because there's all these terrible
reviews out and I'm like what what
happened what happened you guys know
what happened um the highlight I'm
wearing is uh you know is that one rose
quartz from the Becca holiday palette
okay
so let's see Katie okay so I'm going
through the comments Katie looks like
you're being very busy again tonight so
that's two weeks in a row now right so
um that's not good if you guys haven't
subscribed yet to Katie she's my
moderator she's here with me every
single week doing a fantastic job
even when I'm getting very strange
requests from people like I was last
week if you guys were here last week you
probably know what I'm talking about
told my husband about it and he laughed
for like a freaking hour he thought it
was hilarious but she does such a good
job of the leading and blocking and just
keeping the weirdness out of live chats
cuz I don't know why I live tried to get
so weird so if you haven't subscribed to
her yet you should if you click on her
name she's the one with the wrench by
her and I don't take you to our channel
you should subscribe you should
subscribe and say thanks for being great
moderator for Sam because otherwise
these live chats could be very strange
just saying
okay hmm okay let's see what else is
that did I put on my list oh oh um so
I'm just randomly clicked on this one
the other night because I was like let's
just see what this is about it's a new
cuz I'm I'm always in the new section
yeah just like casually browsing I think
like every single morning it's the part
of like my morning routine like what's
me what's the full now and it said Lamar
had a new foundation out and I was like
let's just click on it a hundred and ten
dollars a hundred and ten dollars or I
was like what what does this foundation
say it's going to do to me I'll just go
ahead and find it so let's see where is
it there it is the soft fluid Oh police
I clicked on it the soft fluid long-wear
foundation with SPF 20 I mean hey SPF
that's fantastic
so 110 dollars for does it say how much
it is like huh do you at least get this
loot one fluid ounce
it says iconic skincare and pure color
and one layer and build this fresh peel
foundation to create the luminous look
you love that did not sell me on it that
didn't suck that one you have one line
that's your that's your pitch man that
didn't sell me on it so I'm definitely
not buying a 110 dollar foundation are
you guys do you like lemare you gonna
buy like I like I have the D or
foundation in my cart right now and I
think that's pretty just saying it's
fifty dollars which yes that's a lot but
let's not get started on the nest a lot
of foundation that's forty two dollars
and then you got to go buy a twelve
dollar pump so I don't think fifty-four
Dior's all that bad considering but no
I'm one hundred and ten dollar
foundation
I'm gonna go ahead and skip over that
one along with my one hundred and
fifteen dollar brush can you imagine
those two items I can't I can't do that
man I got it I gotta buy bark boxes you
know those hair expensive
she needs her bark box every month
everyone and she knows when her bark box
gets here she knows she knows which
one's hers and her food cuz we use like
chewy so we get her food sent in the
mail well she knows she knows what her
food is here okay
Oh a lot of you guys are saying live
also talked to you into the saint and
sinner palate yes live was so kind to
also send me st. and center and I truly
truly honestly I will also be reviewing
that on Sunday I did not think I would
like it because I talked myself out of
buying it and will i buy it video I was
like no I don't think I need it too
overwhelming so good like so good
actually it's sixty two dollars so it is
pricey but if you're thinking about
getting it I would get it during the
sale for the if you have 15 or 20
percent off like I've been having so
much fun with it I've been doing a lot
of different eye looks with it was a
yesterday's video
yeah yesterday's bill a bright video I
have it on my eyes the holiday giveaway
it like the darker smokey eye that's
that palette too I really like it I did
put some swatches on my Instagram
tonight if anyone would be interested in
seeing it but really really liked it um
see she is so loud I apologize
um bite Beauty Sean says I want the bite
Beauty set that live recommends which
yes I feel like they have a couple
different uh sets out let me see
oh gosh they have so many different sets
like the perfect bite a mousse bouche
lipstick except for $25 that one it has
four different lipsticks in there
because I don't think live I don't think
you like to be liquid lips if I'm
remembering correctly so maybe that uh
yeah I think that it must be that one
the perfect bite amuse-bouche lipsticks
that for twenty-five dollars
I really do like the bite lipsticks as
well if you like the regular lipsticks I
would recommend it and then I just got a
little sample of the what is this the
amuse-bouche liquefied lip I do like
liquid lipsticks and then this was just
a little sample so I thought I could try
it before I got a full-size so this is
what the little mini looks like and it
was in chutney is the shade I haven't
tried it yet I just got it um it doesn't
kind of smell so that is what chutney
looks like so I haven't tried that one
yet so I wouldn't uh I wouldn't buy any
of the full sizes yet until I try this
guy out and see if I think it's any good
or not but I'm trying to not over by on
lipsticks in the sale and I think right
now I'm just gonna go with the hooter so
rachel says what skincare stuff are you
wanting to pick up I'm pretty sure I've
talked to myself out of everything
skincare wise because I need to go
through my skincare my bathroom is just
like a skincare went off like it just it
looks really bad so let me just
double-check when we look over my loves
list but yeah I think I talked myself
out of out of all of my skincare because
I just I really I just don't need it my
bathroom looks so stupid okay look I'm
embarrassed I'm embarrassed
I do have an exciting a skincare video
coming up
and it's Club with one of my friends
it'll be coming like end of November but
it's skin care related so unlike do not
buy any skin care because you will be so
silly okay so Emily says I'm on the
fence about the Marc Jacobs mini gloss
set I love the Marc Jacobs glosses I
think they're so good he does have a
let's see you I pull it up I think it's
called the snake charmer set I have that
one in the holiday giveaway too
I don't need it for myself personally
because I have two of these sugar sugars
I have the full size and a deluxe size
which is just silly I want to get this
swatch off me before I ruin myself so
it's called the Marc Jacobs Beauty
snake-charmer 5-piece petit enamoured
high shine gloss lacquer collection
which is $39 when this video does go up
as a regular video after we're done I
will go through and link everything you
know even though it's an anti ho and I'm
not buying these things just because I'm
not buying something I still always link
everything because like I'm that person
that's very like just because I don't
want something or don't need something
doesn't mean you don't like I don't know
it's just makeup so but I try to help
linking wise with everything so I
personally don't need it cuz like I said
I have the sugar sugars both sides and
deluxe eyes but I think the formula is
really really good and I think it's like
$28 for the full size and you can get
five yeah 5 minis for the $39 I would
say do it to at least be able to try it
out so I think that one is really good
okay let's see
huh talking so fast dougie so fast um
okay so the milk set someone is asking
about I also have that one in my holiday
giveaway i i personally don't need the
milk set for myself because i have like
the mars holographic stick i have the
blur stick i wouldn't want the glitter
stick that doesn't seem like something
that would be a good fit for me and then
there's another highlight stick in there
which I wouldn't need but I would want
to try the cooling water stick and then
also the matte bronzer I would totally
try those but not enough for me to get
these set but it's $39 and you get the
minis of everything I feel like that
would be a really good set to get if
you've been wanting to try out milk
makeup or something caught my attention
I was like wait the milk makeup blur
liquid matte foundation do I need to put
that one on my love's list has anybody
tried I feel like I haven't heard a lot
of uh I haven't heard a lot of reviews
on that one but such on a foundation
kick right now oh okay okay okay I'm so
far behind on the comments because there
are so many tonight I'm all the way back
to when we were talking about Chloe
Morello and that she's a youtuber and
that an actress mmm Oh Chloe Moretz is
an actress and that must be where I'm
thinking of okay now I don't feel so bad
so I don't feel so bad okay all righty
um Wendy asked do I think the Sephora
favorite slash stash is worth it I do if
you are a big mascara like junkie or
like if you don't wear false lashes and
you wear a mascara every day I totally
would I've actually bought the set once
why I don't I have no idea why I bought
this set because I took me forever to go
through them but I do think it's a
really good deal if you really like
mascaras and you want to find a new
mascara I would totally recommend it so
okay okay now we're talking about
budgets the tomforde brush like how far
behind I am on the comments oh my gosh
yikes
oh let's see the Park Avenue princess
palette is that at Sephora because I
keep looking and I keep not seeing it
there I'm only seeing at Ulta which
makes me a little bit bummed but I keep
waiting because geez okay so today I get
the email from Ulta like 10% off are 10
times points on a bunch of different
products and specific products but still
I'm like it's like I'm looking through
I'm like oh it is only at all - I don't
see it on the support website if it was
I would totally get it in the sale
regardless I'm gonna pick it up from
Optics I'm really excited about it I
talked about it in last week's well I
buy it video
I love Faced palettes I love highlight
contour palette bronzer palettes that's
my jam
oh my gosh Vicky says I don't have Wi-Fi
I'm in data by phone bill is going to be
crazy but it's worth it you are crazy
you are the MVP I've had so many issues
with phones and data that like it's
gonna give me anxiety oh my goodness
let's see um someone asked about
donating to my play with YouTube play
with makeup YouTube fun I don't know
what that is and then my comment skipped
around that sounds like fun
um okay I need to scroll back up to find
my where the comments left jaw but I
don't think I have one of those buns I
did it sounds great
um the color of my nails are there so
many comments at me my selfie and I from
OPI just painted them the other night my
thoughts on the YSL liquid matte lip
stains I do not know if I have an
opinion on loose um I feel like maybe I
saw Sam using them in her video the
other night - wait
was a cool liquid matte lip stains
liquid matte clearness
okay so $36 for ya YSL so the liquid
matte lipstick $36 I mean that's
definitely very pricey that's pretty
pricey for a lipstick did I try no I've
tried the Giorgio Armani lipsticks there
was like a matte lip and they were
pretty pricey too I can't recall the top
of my head how much they were but like
they did nothing for me and I almost
liked it worried about some of these
like really high priced liquid lipsticks
cuz like I feel like I got played on the
Giorgio Armani it was sent to me an
Influenster so it wasn't even like it
was me but I still felt like I got
played so I would not get these again
I'm trying to not go super crazy on my
lipsticks and I just don't think I would
need a $36 YSL lipstick I just don't
think I wouldn't eat it so I'm gonna go
ahead and say no to that one um let's
see she's snoring oh my goodness I can't
even find it where it left off there's
so many comments jeez Louise what a
night okay
oh wise art Visor yes I guys I can't I
can't decide so I had in my wish list
video I had both of Iser the golden hour
palette and then also they make up
forever their holiday one because they
look really similar and a lot of people
wrote in and said that the makeup for
everyone wasn't good they just washed it
in store it wasn't good and all these
different things so I was thinking about
maybe in the visor golden hour which is
$49 but then I'm still teetering on
getting one of the regular palettes but
it's $80 I don't know what to do at this
point like I really don't know I feel
like I should just get the $49 one
but then even in that video a lot of
people who are saying like the old matte
palette would be worth it so I'm still
I'm still debating I'm not gonna ant
I'll all night I'm not gonna anti hell
any anybody so I'm still thinking about
it
I'm still thinking about it but I don't
think then I don't think I'm gonna get
the makeup for everyone just because a
lot of people wrote in saying that it
wasn't good so I guess I'm gonna anti
hold back one wish that was a bummer I
oh my gosh I'm so behind of comments
Emily said those cotton pads will change
your life any comment
it won't even it won't even let me go up
any further oh my gosh
this is crazy Kelly's here Kelly are you
still here hi Kelly oh my gosh I can't
believe how far behind I am um glam glow
Glen will solicit for no glam blow I I
tried really hard to get on the glam
glow train for a while yeah there's a
lot of spar I tried really hard to get
on glam glow strain and I did like the
hydrating treatment the thirsty mud but
I just felt like it was really
overpriced for what it was like it
reminded me of lives video that she did
the other night where like she talked
about the brands that that charge too
much I would definitely put glam glow in
there because I just didn't feel like
like I liked it I didn't think it was
bad I wasn't mad at it but they're like
$69 for a mask and I'm like but no so I
haven't repurchased anything from glam
glow since I bought the thirsty mud I
mean like last year maybe even more than
a year ago I just I just haven't done it
it just that's just my Colin to me I
think they're too expensive okay so
am i picking up any hair products no I
don't really do a lot with my hair I
have so much dry shampoo in my hair
right now it is stupid I need to take a
shower once we get done with this live
which we're at 50 minutes oh it's gonna
be soon uh yeah
like I don't know how to do my hair I
don't I don't have hair skills I can
barely braid my hair
can't really camp French braid very well
I'm just not gonna doing hair and not
even just I can't style it I don't know
what to put in it I can't I don't I
don't know what to do I just got a
little sample of I think it's a brioche
EO like a sprayin treatment and I've
been using that I have no I I don't
think I'm seeing any difference so I
don't put I don't put a lot of like gels
or the only time I really do anything as
I put mousse in my hair when you see my
hair kind of curly the world series
definitely distracted me from showering
I was gonna shower yesterday and then we
had someone come and buy our treadmill
and then right after the other world
series start I couldn't shower here I am
more dry shampoo in my hair um but I
don't really put a lot of things in it
besides the mousse to make my hair curly
I just don't know what else to do with
it so I don't really buy a lot of
haircare products I always have a dry
shampoo on hand and I always have a
mousse that's it other than that I
really don't know what to do so I
wouldn't get any haircare products
either and a lot of times when I do get
hair care products like the mousse I
have right now is from Garnier I just
use the drugstore ones
what's my dry shampoo is the way the
foam dry shampoo and I actually decided
I didn't like it
like I just I feel like it so I have it
in my hair now and I feel like it really
didn't like Jewish my hair like I almost
feel like it makes my hair look horse
sometimes so it's kind of a witch let me
know what you think but I need to try a
different dry shampoo so actually if
anybody does have recommendations I was
just watching Lauren Bay learn my beauty
am I saying that correct I was just
watching her and I feel or maybe though
I watch like five of her videos today
she's probably like a Samantha stop
commenting on my city
like I'm sorry I'm sorry so now I can't
remember if it was in empties the video
or her recommendations cuz I watch it
both record today okay let's see hair
products No okay so luck okay did I have
anything else on my list cuz I'm trying
to read through these comments but oh my
goodness
um let's see okay um oh the benefit I do
want to talk about this one actually
benefit I saw came out with this palette
and like so I like benefit I mean
I'm gonna preface the sameness I do like
benefit I'm a thoug benefit for a long
time
but sometimes sometimes they do things
that make me scratch my head okay
sometimes that happens and then I feel
like I keep seeing things like this and
I'm just kind of like what so this is
called get the party started at the
bronze blush and highlight palette it's
only $20 we're just not bad but it has
in there the hoola bronzer the
California blush and then the what's up
highlight and it's like it's like they
just keep taking their products and like
repackaging them in different things and
then selling them and I'm kind of like
every time I see something new from
benefit I'm like oh what is it that I'm
like oh it's the same products that I
already I have the hoola and the Watts
up and I think I have two of the blushes
like the Box blushes so I'm like I never
need to buy anything new from benefit
because I'm not putting which at the
same time I'm like it's probably not bad
that they're not just constantly putting
out new stuff new stuff new stuff but
I'm almost kind of like why don't we
just keep repairing I don't know what do
you guys think what do you guys think oh
that because on one side I'm like I get
it on the other side I don't get it on
one side I complain when brands come out
with too much stuff but then I'm
complaining that benefits not coming out
so it's like like what do you want
Samantha you can't have it both ways
you can't have it both ways
yes you guys are talking about the
recall on the Gimme brow I saw that that
did happen if you guys have purchased
the Gimme brow lately maybe check out
the recall from that because I'm not
sure something about people's eyes are
getting irritated
so maybe check that out if you guys
bought that one recently um see okay
lashes I am not sure what to do I do
have a pair of the hooter lashes in my
car and those are already like twenty or
twenty four dollars or something which
is expensive but I saw they have the
velour lashes which I've never tried
them so I don't know for sure I don't
know but then they have the Lily lashes
for Sephora collection I just tweeted
about this the other night the perfect
pair of lash kid it's $40 you guys think
I don't know I don't know if there's
other flashes that I should try she took
slow huh she just wakes up and gives a
big sigh like oh you're still talking
neat I'm still talking I know I'm still
talking I'm sorry man
so I don't think though I don't think I
don't think I should get even more
lashes because I just got more pure
lashes I just had a brand from from
Instagram I think yes she was snoring I
just had a brand from Instagram sent me
two pair of lashes so I don't need like
a ton of lashes right now so I think I'm
just gonna stick with the ones in Farah
we strong rhesus our lashes are one of
my weaknesses guys I've been wearing
lashes for so many years so many hairs I
just love them because I think it's cuz
I also I just don't think I have the
patience for mascara I have to sit there
for so long I'm like oh I can't
it takes me it's quicker for me to put
on a pair of falsies even letting the
ante subtree it's just it's
or for me okay um let's see
okay so I'm still like so far behind on
my comments I'm so sorry I don't know if
I've ever have this many people on a
live chat before so I'm so sorry that I
was missing all of these comments but so
far I don't see anything else that we
haven't chatted about like I said the
video will reupload as a regular video
so if you'd want to see everything that
I decided to anti halt
it will go up as a regular video I'll
definitely link everything as it's
processing and stuff I'll work on the
description box
Oh me suppose you would live our friend
goals um thanks it's already I was
talking right the husband about her the
other night and he was like who which
one again and I was like live from
YouTube and he was like oh the one and
he starts to go like this because she
likes the float I was like what do you
think it was kind of funny at my last
bit but he knows he knows you know it's
a good friend when your husband knows
who you're talking about
um let's see okay so yeah I so I don't
see anything yet that we haven't touched
on I feel like we got through a lot of
stuff we're at an hour right now so I
feel like we got through quite a bit I
hope you guys enjoyed the snoring dog
she she is so funny she's she she snores
she snores more than Mitch for sure um
open okay we talked about that yeah we
talked about Pat McGrath that was kind
of more in the beginning drunk elephant
we talked about yeah Fenty oh um I mean
I did I put this in my wishlist video I
am I think I'm gonna get the gloss
especially because the elf and Alyssa
Ashley is sold out when I put it in last
week's bill I buy at video I didn't
realize it was sold out and I did the
description box a couple days ahead of
time I could have swore it let me add it
to my cart but could've been dreamin
could have been dreaming so I'm not
really positive on that but I'm not sure
if that one is going to get restocked
and people were saying the 51 was
similar to it so I think I'm just gonna
go ahead
and pick up the Fenty's $18 and 20% of
haast
B maybe it won't be too bad so I think
I'll go ahead and get that one but but
everything else from 20 you know I put
the the holodeck collection in a well
I'd write video it's just not really for
me just not my vibes don't think I would
use it enough so okay I think that's
everything though oh my goodness yeah
okay I think I really I think that is
everything um when we are were at over
an hour now so I'm going to go ahead and
wrap it up here but thank you guys so
much for coming by this was a crazy a
live chat I'm so sorry that I couldn't
get to everybody's comments but there
was so many comments I could not keep up
tonight but thank you so much for coming
by and checking this out like I said
it'll be upload us a regular video if
you missed any of it you can ask me what
I decided not to get of course as I
always say with my anti hauls it's you
