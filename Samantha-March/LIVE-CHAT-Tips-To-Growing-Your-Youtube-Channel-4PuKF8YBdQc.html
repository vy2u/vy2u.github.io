to fix my camera it's like falling it's
like falling this way so good way to
start at my mini tripod broke last week
and they're sending me a replacement
which is really nice but I'm having to
put up with a broken tripod for the
temping so sorry if you have to watch me
like this hi guys hi sorry if I do I
look really weird live like like are you
guys gonna get like neck pinches from
trying to watch me like that I apologize
so much bye hi guys we are doing another
livestream okay do you guys say it looks
okay okay good great cuz I'm just so
worried my camera's about to fall off at
any moment okay hey how's it going guys
okay so in today's video what does the
Twitter pull requested the most was tips
to grow a YouTube channel so I'm super
excited about it I also feel kind of
weird doing it I always feel a little
bit weird where I almost feel like I am
trying to like teach or something
because I mean I have had a beauty
channel for a year we just recently had
20,000 subscribers which is super super
exciting but I think it's really easy to
compare yourself to a lot of other big
channels you know what I'm saying so I'm
like 20,000 and people want to hear this
topic from me like hey Kati and like it
just like kind of surprises me but
hopefully I can give some good tips or
advice or just things that I found that
worked for me hopefully this can be
somewhat helpful to you and if you're
watching on the replay hopefully it
helps you guys out as well I did get
some questions about super chat in last
week's video so I double-checked I do
have super chat enabled I honestly I'm
not super familiar with super chat
myself but I guess it is where you can
make a donation to my channel and your
comment will be like highlighted I think
and put to the very top of my comment
fees so basically so I can see it easier
because when your guys's comments come
in I only get three at a time and they
go very very quickly so people have
asked if I could turn on the super chat
and I got asked specifically if I would
turn it on for this video
because I guess some of you guys might
have questions so it is enabled don't
feel like you have to do it or anything
like that but it should be enabled if
anybody is interested in it of course if
anyone that makes a donation to my
channel the donation would go back to my
channel
specifically I'm thinking for items to
review and things like that and I would
really like to do what like Jen loves
reviews does where when she does the
review video of what she bought from her
super chat she does list the names of
everybody who did donate so that is what
I want to do as well so I wanted to get
that out of the way before I start
getting super distracted I have a paper
and pen in hand because okay so Mickey
said do have to pay for a super chat so
yes what I understand what it is is that
you make a monetary donation and I think
it's like the more that you donate the
longer time that your comment will be
like pinned to the top of my comment
screen so I can see it I believe that
that is the way that it goes I think you
can do anywhere I'm not sure the minimal
amount actually I want to say I've heard
like anywhere from like five dollars up
or something like that so again don't
feel pressured I'm gonna try to get
through as many questions as I can but I
did get quite a few questions about it
this week as I was saying guys kind of
make this video so I wanted to point
that out but I do have my pen and paper
because if I I'm kind of nervous to do
this live because I'm just gonna have to
kind of like try to come up on the spot
where usually when you do Q&amp;amp;A like this
you kind of get your questions
beforehand and you can think about them
and you know all that good stuff so I'm
kind of nervous like what if I can't
think of a good answer or the right
answer or things like that
so in case I have any of those questions
I was just gonna write them down and
then answer them later or things like
that are on my snapchat so just in case
we have any any questions um so I wanted
to get into it so if you guys have any
questions for me on anything about
growing a YouTube channel whether it be
content or talk about the lighting okay
I can talk about lighting so content
what I use or anything like that just to
let me know and I'll try to get through
as many comments as I can for lighting
when I first started my youtube channel
I only
did natural light so I film I'm gonna
write some of these down anyways how do
you choose the camera okay so a lot of
questions about my camera and I actually
pulled it out so I have it right here
so for lighting I just filmed in front
of a very large window if you follow me
on snapchat you usually see it's like
area sits in front of it so I have a
very large window when I first started
my channel that is the only only thing
that I used and I would have to film
during the daylight if it was raining of
those snowing if those whatever I
basically couldn't film because I was
only using that I eventually went on to
purchase two soft boxes when I do upload
this as like once the livestream is over
and I upload as a regular video I can
leave any of this in the description box
down below if you want to come back and
check that out but I purchased two soft
boxes from Lima studio I just got him
off of Amazon I think it was $70 for two
soft boxes and they're pretty large soft
boxes um I lost my train of thought for
a second sorry they are pretty large
soft boxes and they worked well enough
but they weren't quite they weren't
quite perfect and I couldn't quite
figure out exactly where to put them and
then a little bit ago like maybe a month
ago I did get sent a ring light from
diva ring light and it has helped so
much I actually do have it on right now
it's the only thing in front of me
katie has do the softbox does make a
difference when you're using it natural
light not really I didn't really need
the soft boxes when I use natural light
if it was super bright I was only using
the soft boxes if it was kind of like
overcast or dark I tried to use them in
like the pitch dark like filming at
night and those videos just like it
didn't really work out but the ring
light is honestly what has very much
saved me a lot of times I'm only using
the ring light I don't even use the soft
boxes unless I'm filming at night night
and then I would do a ring light I would
do a softbox to one side of me and I
would do a softbox behind me because if
you don't have light behind you you can
have too many shadows that was one thing
that took me a long time to learn so if
ever you can put a light behind you if
you're filming in a really dark setting
that will really help to kind of
brighten everything up and so you don't
have as many shadows but basically now I
typically will always use my ring light
even if I'm filming in natural light
because I just help
I think it helps things be a little bit
brighter I have my ring light and then I
have my tripod in front of it with my
camera and then I sit here so I still
mess around and not the best with it
especially since I just got the ring
light but I think it's been really
really handy a lot of times if I'm
filming at daylight I put the diffuser
cloth over it so it's not quite as
bright and if I'm filming more in the
dark or like overcast I take the
diffuser off because it's brighter do
you point the light upwards that's
behind you yes I do so my softbox is
come on a tripod as well and what I do
is I just smush them down all the way
and then I flip it all the way up I flip
the actual softbox all the way up oh
Vanessa thank you here's some sweetness
oh you're so nice but yeah that's what I
just I flip it up so the light is
pointing upwards and I found that that
is what helps the most when it comes to
lighting so those are kind of my
lighting tips and ideas and also when I
reload or if you guys just want to go
back and look on the channel regardless
I have a video about getting my ring
light reviewing my ring light and then
also kind of my filming set up and that
sort of thing so there's more in that
video too but a lot of people are asking
about my camera so right now I film with
the sony a 5100 I thought someone would
ask about it so I thought I would pull
it out I'm just to be able to show you
because I do the live thank you so much
Katie
you guys are so free umm writing your
names down even though I'm pretty sure
it tells you but I don't care I just
want to make sure
so the sony a 5100 so when I first
started my youtube channel again I can
link it down below I have a video about
starting a YouTube channel with no money
because that's what I did and I just
used my phone which is what I do to film
the life now oh my gosh Lisa come
you guys know that I get emotional so if
we're live and I get emotional it's
really hard for me to stop so anyway so
I was filming just off of my phone I
know Lisa I know it dears I do I know um
I was filming just off my phone and
honestly a lot of phones these days have
really good cameras so um there's so
many comments have so many good cameras
coming in and honestly it worked out
really well there's also a free youtube
editor if you guys don't like editing
there's a free youtube editor that's
what I started out with and again I do
mention that in the video so it was
really easy to use it was free I'll live
mmm thank you and that's what I use for
a while until I felt more confident to
actually buy an editing program and I
now use wondershare filmora
but when I finally decided it was about
I don't even know when it was I got my
income tax back and I was like I'm
buying a camera I was so so excited
about it hi Brooke um so I bought the
camera I bought the sony a 5100
basically I watched a lot of YouTube
videos and everybody was like I started
with the sony a 5100 so to let you guys
know I'm not a technology person I
struggle so hard and it's really
embarrassing because I started a website
in 2009 Oh
Thank You Michelle from Victorville
California that's so cool oh my gosh so
cool um I was born in Visalia California
I don't know where Victorville is but
that's really cool so yeah I don't I
don't know technology very well and it's
really embarrassing to be honest um so I
was very overwhelmed with buying a
camera because I was like what if I
can't figure it out then that's gonna
suck Oh your dad was in Visalia that is
so cool
lifts us does a sony a 5100 stuff
recording at a certain time yes I can
film for about 13 minutes straight on
this guy and then it overheats and I
have to shut it off but I will say it
has a lot of really good features on it
I got my
and oh you're from Fresno Michelle
that's look I dunno Fresno that I do
know but these sony a 5100 I think it
has a lot of plus and minuses but I will
say as a beginner I will say that I
think it is a good beginner camera
because I was able to get it pretty well
it has things like autofocus which I
really enjoy no 13 minutes but not work
for you later no that's for sure
and has a lot of features that I'm
enjoyed like the autofocus I mean it has
a good zoom this is just the stock lens
it has a good zoom on it what are the
other features I mean it was around four
to five hundred dollars I think which is
not as expensive as some other cameras
of course I mean it still is a an
investment but I've had this for over a
year and I haven't had any problems I
had one issue the other day where it
wouldn't turn on and I got really
worried but I just gave it a second and
it turned on just fine so that was good
but I like it it does also have the
flipped screen which i think is really
handy too because I started vlogging and
so it's really nice because I can turn
the camera around I can see myself but
also just when filming to be able to
flip this up and see myself when I was
filming on my phone I have doors leading
into my office and if I got him just
right and the shadows were just right I
could see myself in the pain of my
window which was ah but a lot of times I
had no idea if I was in frame I just had
no clue oh no let's not get catty
okay cool um so that's good but one of
the downfalls I think like the biggest
downfall is that it overheats so quickly
so like I said I can get it for 13
minutes and then it needs to chill for
at least like 10 to 15 minutes and then
I can go again for another 13 minutes so
instead of just being able to sit down
and film I have to keep like pausing and
then when I pause like I get distracted
and I start doing something else and
then a half hour later I come back and
I'm like okay where did I leave off of
and it turns my filming set up into like
a three hour process where it could just
be like 30 minutes straight through so
that's a bummer but for beginners I feel
like this is really easy it also has a
really good feature of you can
wirelessly transfer
your photos to your phone you just have
an app that you put onto your phone I
can't remember what it's called right
now but um then I can just go in and
where else I choose which photos that I
want and it takes them directly to my
phone so that I can edit and upload to
Instagram and then it's really easy to
to transfer the videos over so I found
this really easy to use and honestly I
don't really have changed I haven't
really changed my settings because I
don't really get them I have tried to
watch videos and people you know talk
about things but like I don't know what
white balance is I don't know what
f-stop is it's so confusing to me but
honestly the default settings I think
work well enough sorry I got to put in
my hair I think the default settings
work well enough for me right now with
that I'm I'm doing an okay enough job I
do hope to be able to upgrade a camera
sometime soon and then maybe have this
as just a vlog camera but it's probably
gonna be like I went into the future so
there's that um so filmora okay so
filmora when i record with my phone do i
use the front or back camera when I was
recording for a YouTube video I was
recording with the back camera so that's
why I wouldn't be able to see myself but
like if you do a YouTube live then I
film with the front camera so I can see
myself and I can see the comments but
yes for editing I use one or two of
wondershare filmora I think it's like
$50 a year or something like that it's
pretty inexpensive and I thought it was
very beginner friendly because again I
know nothing about editing and people
talking about Final Cut Pro like just
overwhelming to me so much okay Rachel
says 35-ish for the year okay um randy
said there's no money sign to donate i
think that someone say you can't do a
super chad on an iphone i'm not sure
about how much time do I spend editing
each video it depends on what the video
is but what I do is I'll run through the
video first and I'll cut in slice like
you know I'll slice out all of my um
Zoar if I'm like grabbing a product or
things like that and then i rewatch it
again and I try to cut out how much I
repeat myself because I know I repeat
myself a ton I'm so I've been trying to
cut down the amount that I repeat myself
and then I will go back a third time and
I will do like an intro card and I will
put in like the pop ups that you see in
my video where it says like my snapchat
and Twitter and Instagram and that sort
of thing and I put in like a subscribe
button or any other photos
sound effects anything like that so I
usually watch every single video three
times and you guys know that some of my
videos are 20 to 30 minutes so it's a
lot it's a lot of time that I spend on
editing but I just try to do the best
that I can
I don't have anything like super crazy
yet like I can't do everything crazy
that people can do on Final Cut Pro
because Warner chef Omar doesn't have
all of it but I think they have good
enough like transitions and you know
they have sound effects right in there
that you can use too and I just really I
just really like it I think it was good
for beginners I again oh thank you um
well Rachel said do I stand well filming
videos no I sit I sit on a very tall
barstool that is what I sit on I know
sometimes it looks like I'm standing but
I am sitting on just a tall barstool but
what was I talking about oh I think one
or triple Nora is very good for
beginners too so if you are a beginner
and you're not sure about editing I
think it's a good way to kind of get
your feet wet and that sort of thing I
hope to upgrade maybe one day because I
know like I see kind of like the cool
effects that people can do with stuff
about um with Final Cut Pro but I think
it's good enough for me right now and
I'm I'm happy with it and also there's a
lot of really good tutorials to learn
how to do certain things like
sessions and things like that and I mean
they have really cool things you can
like mirror-image I think you can even
do like green screen on there but I
don't really I've never really dealt
into that but they do have a lot of
features and I thought that they were
very cost friendly because I was nervous
to choose an editing program so um that
boy George says what about intro videos
what what about them what do you mean by
intro videos let me ask that let me know
let me know what you're asking and I can
try to answer that as best as I can all
right that job okay Nina what computer
do you use cuz I have a HP and the
quality comes out bad I have an HP as
well I don't think or and I mean this is
where I'm like not very good at
technology but I don't think it should
be the computer that makes a difference
it should either be your camera or your
editing software I will say for editing
with wondershare filmora
it took them a long time to realize this
- my export settings take a look at them
because it also does matter
I now export at like 1920 I think it's
like the one of the highest ones that
you can do like 1920 by something
because that will have it to be able to
watch in 1080 which is like the best
quality that you can get on YouTube um
so that is what I use but play run with
the different settings and it took me a
while to get mine figured out but I was
finally able to get them for both
YouTube and Instagram
I do use wondershare filmora to create
my Instagram tutorials as well so okay
that's a little bit about editing Rachel
says how did you get your name out there
it's hard to be noticed in the beauty
community on YouTube because there were
so many girls now most definitely it's
very hard Vanessa says an intro like
Stephanie Nicole that may be what
they're referring to and see I don't
have one like that I don't really have
like any sort of set intro or anything
sometimes I just have like a black
picture that I put at the beginning of
my videos and then I over
texted in on wondershare filmora to say
like what the video is but that's all it
is it's just a black eye just Google
black backgrounds saved at the image and
then I upload it in wondershare I put it
in the screen and then I overlay a text
from wondershare on the screen so that's
all I do for my intro I don't have like
a cool video or anything like that but
Rachel Wood asks how I got my name out
there honestly I think it's the biggest
part for me was utilizing other social
media platforms I I was on social media
before I started a YouTube channel
because I am a published author and I'm
also book blogger so I started a book
blog in 2009 and then went on to publish
novels so I was already really familiar
with like Facebook and Twitter Pinterest
and things like that and I already had
like somewhat of a following even though
they're not necessarily beauty but I
think it also kind of helped just being
familiar with the platforms where I
think more and more people are familiar
with the platforms now but still not
everybody is so I think that kind of
helped me but just like consistently
posting like cross posting my other
photos to my Facebook pages to Twitter I
pin every single video that I make on
Pinterest I pin all like my Instagram
post and then just trying to be
consistent I think helped me out a lot
too
consistently uploading videos those are
kind of like my best ways that I feel
like I got my name out there but also
one of the best things that I think too
is making friends with other people in
the community and doing oh my gosh the
word has left me collaborations videos
doing collabs with other friends and
things like that and even something like
joining a like a Facebook group I belong
to quite a few Facebook groups and even
like Instagram little groups of other
people who make the same kind of content
we can support each other and then that
can lead to collabs but I mean obviously
I'm a subscriber to so many of my
friends who make youtube videos and then
their subscribers to me and that kind of
helps to build your following and I know
like we shout each other out so much and
we tried to do a good job of doing that
I guess and then you can do collabs and
you can
expand your audience that way so I think
that would Harriet says I'd love to see
you
collab with Olivia okay more on that
later
Cassie says really Pinterest and think
of that I post a Twitter and Instagram
Pinterest to me is super easy to do it
because I have something like a pin
installer on my computer so it's super
easy for me to go to my video and then I
should just click pin to Pinterest and
it goes out into the world and it's
totally fine is it difficult for you to
keep viewers interested in your content
does it upset you that you don't have
more viewers and subscribers one of the
one of the best tips of advice that I
could give about like content and such
is pay attention to your videos pay
attention to your analytics and I know
that might sound really easy but it was
something that didn't click for me for
awhile I was kind of being like very
sporadic and I was doing all these
different kinds of videos and I felt
like maybe I was kind of getting a
little bit stagnant with my channel like
it wasn't really growing or moving
anywhere and I think once I finally
started paying attention to seeing what
videos would work the best I was like oh
okay so I should make more of those
videos because that is what my audience
wants to see and honestly since I
started paying attention to the
analytics I feel like I've seen a very
large increase in in my channel in both
views and then also subscribers as well
to me honestly views means more to me
than subscribers because it means people
are actually watching it's super easy
for people to subscribe to a channel and
you know I have like my mom and my
husband and my friends that subscribe
but maybe they don't watch but watching
it means a lot to me because me watch it
means a lot to me because I put a lot of
work into the videos into the editing
into the equipment into marketing the
videos so it means a lot to me when
people watch the videos but definitely
once I saw that the the videos on my
channel that were getting the most views
were the videos where I just talked
about makeup when I came up with the
will i buy it series i was the first one
to do a will i buy it which is a spinoff
- they did a haul but once Hayami hi
Jenny um hey thanks for coming by
but once I did the well I buy it video
and I saw 20 views came in for some
reason or another I was like nervous to
do another one because I was like wow I
don't know if anyone liked it even
though the views were telling me
differently the comments were telling me
differently I still waited like a month
and a half to do another will I buy it
and then I did it will I buy it and then
a bunch of people watch that video too
and it took me a while but I was finally
like I should make this a weekly thing
and whether you just had just something
weekly monthly whatever it is once I
figured out the videos that my viewers
were coming back for and asking for and
I started doing them more than my abuse
guys is that a ma is that man why do we
consume black that man seriously
um but once I started paying attention
to that then that's when I saw my views
and subscribers really grow so some
people they have their channel and
mostly focus on tutorials some are
mostly focused on reviews some are
mostly focused on hauls mine is mostly
focused on talking about makeup so you
know kind of find your niche and it
doesn't mean that that's the only thing
you have to do because you can
definitely do more things and have a
more well-rounded channel but if you
find did topics that are really
connecting with your viewers and
bringing in more viewers then it can be
a little bit more consistent in in
growth that's the biggest thing that I
realized and the biggest thing that I
kind of took away it just it just took
me a while to get there but that's why
you see me do a lot of videos talking
about makeup best and worst series the
will I buy it's you know things like
that so thank you guys for reporting
black coat I missed it the first time it
happened in a live chat but I didn't
that was a little time so there's that
okay so let's see is there any other
I've been doing a bad job writing gun
questions Mickey says so it takes some
time to find a niche I mean it took me
almost a year I would say so yeah
definitely I mean if growth doesn't
happen for you right away
don't panic because it's gonna take time
and a lot of people who have these
millions of subscribers they've been
making YouTube videos for 3 5 7 years
and you know they didn't get to a
million overnight I think it's
definitely harder
not with you two because it's definitely
more of a saturated market and same
thing with Instagram but if you stay
consistent and you keep putting the work
in I truly honestly feel assign someone
to moderate on Tuesdays okay I will make
a note of that but I really truly
honestly feel that the growth will come
and then with anything you can't expect
it to happen overnight or even really in
a few months it'll take time and I think
viewers like to see people being
consistent now and and that's I don't
know maybe that's just my personal thing
but sometimes I'll get frustrated
wouldn't youtuber only post once a week
once a month I'm like where are you like
what are you doing so how often should
someone upload videos I think it is a
personal thing and one thing that I
would suggest doing is trying out
different things because I think a lot
of people think there is one time that
you should post on YouTube there's one
today that you should post on YouTube
and that will be the best for you and I
would say check it out and see what
works best for you because I took about
one month and I would post about like I
would post just on random days and not
random times and I would see what would
get the best views and I would make
notes of that and then I would once I
figured out like oh okay so it helps for
me to post in the morning I posted about
between 9:00 and 9:15 CST I felt like
that was getting the best times so then
I consistently posted at that time and I
was getting good consistent views and
then just us like a one-off one time I
was like I'm gonna try to post at night
and see what happens
and my viewership was way down there so
it's gonna depend on you as you depend
on your audience I would say play around
with it that really is my best tip see
with today's work butter and which times
work better I have started posting every
single day just because I feel like I
have so much content and between
live-streaming and doing vlogging it's
really really easy for me to post
everyday I also do work from home so
there's that I mean I'm not having to
like go anywhere and not that this is
like my full-time job but I consider it
part of my full-time jobs and then I
also
ultimate author but it helps me and I
can do everyday but I don't feel like
everybody needs to do everyday I've been
reading a lot more that with this
algorithm with YouTube it's better if
you post four more times a day like some
people are even saying that you should
post two times a day which that to me is
just a little insane I feel like every
day is already really crazy but I would
say if you can do at least twice a week
that would probably help another thing
that I suggest is having some sort of
schedule I actually once I got to ten
thousand subscribers I was able to get
like a YouTube manager something like
that I think it's called it's someone
who works within YouTube and we can have
phone calls or email discussions it's
really cool part of YouTube and when I
spoke with her she suggested doing a
series and she suggested having a
schedule and to make your schedule known
you will see on when you go to my
YouTube page like my header in the
beginning says I post new videos on
Sunday Mondays Wednesdays and Thursdays
I do need to change it I've only been
doing every day for about two weeks now
so I don't know I might wait a little
bit longer to change it but people like
to know and one thing that I take away
from YouTube is that it's almost kind of
like a TV shows me now since I started
really getting into YouTube and watching
YouTube I I cannot remember the last
time I turned on our TV I really can't I
mean we were gone all weekend so that
doesn't help but I cannot remember the
last time I turned on my TV YouTube to
me is my TV and a lot of times people
like to know the days that you're going
to upload and sometimes they even like
to know the times that you up love
that's why I try to be consistent
posting between 9:00 and 9:15 sometimes
it's between 9:00 and 10:00 you know
doing everyday and how much editing you
have to do sometimes I get a little bit
behind on nine o'clock on the dot type
of thing but if they know the day then
they know to come to your channel I know
the days that I can go to someone else's
channel and and watch one of their new
videos and it really is helpful and then
you don't have to rely on the
notifications by Vanessa and thank you
so then you don't have to rely on the
notifications because I know a lot of
people say they don't get notified I
barely get notified when people plus a
new video so if they know you're a
schedule date then that can be a good
things
Lucas says does the thumbnail help get
more viewers
I think the thumbnail is definitely
important but I don't know because to me
a lot of people say like the thumbnail
is one of the best things and I don't
know maybe in the beginning the
thumbnails can help if you don't have a
huge subscriber base yet if you can make
a thumbnail very catchy looking but
after a while for me the thumbnails
don't really do much for me and again
this could just be a personal thing but
the thumbnails don't seem to do as much
for me I care more about what the actual
video is going to be about that I want
the content versus the thumbnail if that
makes sense I make my thumbnail in canva
I know a lot of people use pink pink pic
monkey as well
and they have free items they both have
free and paid for items I always just
used the free it's super easy I just
take the thumbnail right on my sony a
5100 I transfer it to my phone and then
I uploaded to canva you can do different
texts and you can add photos in there
and things like that so that is what I
use for my thumbnail but again I would
probably focus more on the content and
then marketing your video and that's
what I think is most important but don't
but the thumbnail I mean you do want to
have a good thumbnail you don't want it
to be like dark and strange looking or
not have anything to do with the video
but to me the the content and getting
your video out there I think are more
important so I'm glad that you don't use
the fake click fades yeah some
thumbnails and some titles really drive
me crazy
I honestly like I've had to subscribe
from some people because I would just
get so annoyed at like you think their
video is one thing and then you click on
it's completely different it doesn't
want to do the with the thumbnail or the
timeline you're like what are you doing
like it makes me so angry let's see what
ok so a lot of people use PicMonkey and
that's good ok is there any other
questions because we are at 30 minutes
so I'm going to want to wrap it up if
you guys want to see you apart to let me
know but or I do a Twitter poll every
month every month every week on Twitter
I'm a vice
at the March and I asked what you guys
want to see in the next YouTube live so
if you don't follow me over there let
her follow go ahead and follow me so I
know what to talk about for next week
let's see what's your favorite part
about being an influencer
oh gosh you had to block someone else
okay what's your favorite part of being
an influencer like the friendships that
I make but to me that hands down is the
best part to be able to talk everyday to
people like all around the world is so
incredibly crazy to me and to make
friendships and connections with people
that I probably would never have the
chance to without social media and
without being on certain platforms I
think it's just really amazing and I
mean I talked to the same people on
snapchat every single day on Instagram
every single day on Twitter every single
day and it's just it's really cool to
see those types of friendships get made
Ashley says would you ever have a meet
and greet I totally would but I feel
like that's a long time in the future um
Jenny says hugs Ares thank you um okay
yes mean great that's so like story I
just don't think about um but thank you

Twitter poll so let me know we could
always do a part two if there's
something else about YouTube that let's
all go to Iowa super fun here guys super
fun here but let me know what you'd want
to see in the next video the comments
that you do in the livestream don't come
over to when the video actually
processes and uploads like like a
regular YouTube video so if you have any
other comments you want to give come
check it out when the actual video goes
up and leave a comment so I can see all
of them I hope this was somewhat helpful
to you guys um because I know a lot of
people have been asking for this video
it got voted on when I did the Twitter
poll so I hope it was somewhat helpful
and if you do want to see another video
