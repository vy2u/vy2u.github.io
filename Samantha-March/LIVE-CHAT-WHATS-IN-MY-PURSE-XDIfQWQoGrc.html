oh man we are going to do a live video
today I'm in a different house and
everything and oh my
if you guys don't follow me on snapchat
or I think I've talked a little bit
about it on Twitter too I actually have
not had internet at my house since
Tuesday afternoon it was about Tuesday
at 1:00 no internet and my internet
provider hi guys my internet provider
can't come until tomorrow afternoon so
I've been spending the days at my friend
Shannon's house which is where I am and
just been working from here trying to
get everything done so I'm super bummed
because I was changing my lives from
Tuesday I was gonna change him to
Thursday nights because a lot of people
said nights would work good for them and
my Thursday nights had opened up so I
was gonna do Thursdays at 7:30 CST but I
will be back at my house tonight with no
internet so I can't go live so before I
leave Shannon's I usually leave here
probably like an hour so I head back
home I thought I would just hop on here
and do another live so at least I can
have a video today and I could have
another live video so it's been really
it's been a really stressful couple days
they live oh man it's been interesting
but you know hey Kenny's here yeah
hopefully tomorrow I really hope I
really hope it gets fixed but I'm gonna
try to pull up my life here so I can
watch all the comments too so I I always
asked on Twitter what you guys want to
see for live videos and yeah there's all
my comments okay so I always ask on
Twitter what you guys my seat for my
lives and it actually was a tie last
week between nail polish collection and
just like a casual chitchat and so I was
gonna do nail polish collection because
everybody on my snapchat that didn't
have Twitter wrote in and said nail
polish collection so I was going to do
that but then with the
as of today and just you know feeling
all out of sorts I wasn't sure if I
would be able to get my nail polish
collection over here but I actually did
this is a nice here's my nail polish
collection it's not really too bad I
declared it kind of recently so I was
gonna do that but then this morning I
was like on snapchat I was like oh man
you know if I can't get all my nail
polishes over here maybe I could just do
a what's in my purse because I'm like I
really need to clean my purse out it's
very embarrassing right now like it's an
I'm embarrassed of my purse and
everybody on snapchat said to do what's
in my purse everybody there was not one
vote for the belt father to collect and
I was like you guys it's so embarrassing
but I'm gonna show you what's in my
purse and you guys are gonna see why
it's so embarrassed
hi just got another and Kelsey Mary
Elaine who said there's bug behind me
there's like a big one is that are you
for real okay so I haven't done okay
there's no bug okay I'm like wait there
I keep having I got my dog here and then
Jana has a German Shepherd now they're
both just lying underneath my chair but
I've been letting them in and out all
day but I'm Shannon was that you Shannon
that said I have a huge purse yes and
yes it's very it's very embarrassing so
this is my purse this is from Teddy
Blake when I upload this as a regular
video hopefully I could get the
description box filled out in a decent
amount of time but this is from Teddy
Blake they did send this to me it was
featured in a haul a couple months back
and I was so excited because the purse I
had before then it wasn't Michael Kors
purse and I saved up for a really long
time it was my publishing present to
myself for one of my past books but it
was like falling apart like it was it
was in really rough shape someone tape
like said they were gonna send me a
purse and it was it's so nice I'm like
it's like what did i do - there's no so
cool so one of the reasons why I think
I'm embarrassed about my purse is
because you know like we have wallets
and stuff and that's pretty normal but I
also have a purse in
my parents so this is my clutch that I
take with me like when I go out on the
weekends and stuff this is what I take
with me because I don't want to take my
giant purse I just put everything like
that's important in here and then a lot
of times I don't take it out because
weekends and I'm always like it's so
annoying that you know I put everything
in my clutch away and I put it all away
and then three days later we're going
out again I'm like up now I'm putting
everything back into my clutch like it's
kind of ridiculous a lot of times I just
I just leave stuff in here and then I
just put it in my purse because I am so
lazy you guys look at it a credit card
license credit card I am that lazy that
I won't put my credit cards back in my
actual wallet that goes in my purse I
keep them in my clutch that's
embarrassing like I'm so lazy when it
comes to putting my stuff away so yeah
love you need beautiful your clutch are
your Persie up that's that is what I do
so in my clutch we had some credit cards
and my ID I also have a byte multi stick
I believe this is in brioche I'm wearing
this in tomorrow's video the video
that's going up tomorrow I have my tarts
rainforest of the sea marine boosting
mist cuz you know when you're out and
about the last thing that we did last
weekend is we did a scavenger hunt
around Des Moines I was like really
weird how I did that not sure not sure
why I did that but we did a scavenger
hunt around Des Moines I knew it was
gonna be really warm so I packed a
little mist in case we needed to spray
our faces I also have the Tarte this
little guy came in the Sephora give me
some nude lips it's in rum punch so
pretty I think this is what I was
wearing yesterday actually um got some
loose change piece the gum you always
need gum I always have gum on me oh and
then a pack of gum too cuz like why do I
have a separate piece of gum out from a
pack of gum that's embarrassing got a
receipt for margarita so there's that
got some eyelash adhesive yup got some
hope this is my Maybelline better skin
powder love this powder
nice little mirror too so go with that
in there and then these were my
lipsticks of choice Oh got an eyeliner
this is the appear on point eyeliner and
then this is the huda beauty lipstick
and girlfriend and then awesome so so I
got to my jobs here and any time they
hear like the slightest noise they freak
out and go crazy so there isn't Jack but
then I have this little Marc Jacob sugar
sugar gloss it's like the travel side
it's probably the mailman um so that's
Oh more loose change in my clutch so
that's everything in my clutch in my
clutch so there's that and my clutch
that goes inside my purse because I'm
embarrassing so well put everything back
in my clutch now oh yeah yeah Romeo and
Juliet yeah Oh areas and Jack we like to
call them boyfriend and girlfriend they
have the same birthday which is kind of
fun September 26 but Aires is the year
older just one year older than Jack but
they're together all the time and we're
gonna be gone this weekend and they get
bored it together like they're bored it
in the same kennel and everything Sarge
my legs not great I need to probably
open those blinds a little bit more but
okay so now moving on to what's actually
inside my purse purse well first we have
Ares leash because I didn't know what's
coming over here I was like maybe I
could get him walking I mean I haven't

sucks and then even though my wallet is
full of like the reward things I still
have three more in the bottom of my
purse
and a lot of change actually there's
quite a bit of changing here let's see
and then in this little side pocket this

was just able to try it today my I have
it on my eyes and then I tried the lip -
I only got the eyeshadow palette and
then two of the lipsticks so I don't
know what I'm gonna do for that one it
maybe I'll do a tutorial with them but I
used on two of the shades today they
were kind of hard to work with I which I
which I thought like when you have to
only use your finger or use water I
figured it'd be a little hard to work
with it it was but I still think it's
just I think it's pretty so um you ever
asked if I know when they're restocking

heard of a specific date yet Heather

don't even oh there's only like that
much left I really need to just throw
that away because that has to be old and
he said yeah
traveling back and forth um the
travelling has been really hard because
I'm trying to get over here right away
