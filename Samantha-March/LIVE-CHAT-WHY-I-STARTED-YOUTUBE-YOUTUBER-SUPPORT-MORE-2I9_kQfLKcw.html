days is it tomorrow that the Ofra
highlighters are on sale because I have
I want to get some highlighters and then
I want to get some of the what are they
called Hot Buys we're gonna get some of
those and have a Sephora order ready to
go I'm just waiting to get a gift card
in so uh waiting for my gift card I'm
gonna order from Sephora see what else
are we talking about um someone said Big
Macs are grills
no no I know no I know so I still eat
them though Brittany you had grilled
cheese salad how there you had a salad
that sounds good too hello from New
Jersey I wonder if you could get
rotisserie chicken from Walmart a lot of
times we get a rotisserie chicken from
our uh what's it called just like our
grocery store and we either put it on
sandwiches or like we've even put it in
like soup that was good
oh let's see maybe you have extras I
wish it are close by oh let's see oh I
love garden I love Olive Garden and
Sonia had an ice cream sandwich that's
what I'm talking about I'm talking about
Melrose says you are so excited for
though for highlighters tomorrow yes so
it is tomorrow yeah definitely want to
get some highlighters I think that was
the only other one and then Sunday I do
want to get a pretty sure it's Sunday
that the NYX palette I Ferretti I forgot
to tell my snapchat that I was coming on
my life hello I was trying to charge my
phone because this like dreams phone
battery like crazy um what was I gonna
say Sunday Sunday I think those NYX
pallets are gonna be on sale at Ulta
that's $30 next Palace if this was a
regular video I would edit in that
cha-ching sound right now wait I thought
you were on a no buy for highlighters
yeah but they're helpful so I'm here
when they're half off I don't know how
how do you say no to that how how do you
say no to that and I broke it because I
bought the wet and wild precious petals
highlight and now now I feel like it's
over I feel I feel like once you break
it you just you just broke it yeah broke
it oh no so Steph says I just got the
next palette say like nothing like the
photos online
different person oh that is so sad oh oh
I'm so bummed I don't even know what to
say because I'm like okay surely if
they're charging $30 they have to have
done something right like the quality
has to be great or something like it
can't just be like better packaging and
they have some influencers being the
face of them like they have to be better
quality and to be better something right
right oh no what they really I mean they
hardcore caught my attention and didn't
they I feel like they released the
pallets like they released the photos
and like all of that before they release
the prices I feel like that's what
happened at least for me like I saw the
photos first and I was like yes diggin
it and all of a sudden they were like
it's $30 and I was like what's she
talking about
like what but they already sucked me in
30 seconds like no don't you but I do I
have so many all the points because I
did the 10 times platinum appreciation
day at Ulta and I legitimately have so
many points now that you know and you
can take it back if I don't like it I
will take it back I will take it back
okay let's see a lot of people are
talking about centi beauty I'm watching
some of the snap well not right now but
I was watching some of the snaps of
people at the launch party I got invited
but I was like you know nah I'm just
kidding it it and it I'm just like I
didn't get invited but actually exciting
so far I've only seen a couple of snaps
come in I've been watching desi tonight
on snapchat it's not her
snaps but I'm excited to see I'm just
excited to see what it actually is
because people keep asking me to put 20
beauty in in a will I fight and I'm like
but I don't I don't even know I don't
even know where this I don't know what
the products are I don't know what they
look like
I still don't I don't think we still
know the prices right
I think they put out like the collection
photo today but there's no prices on it
so like if they're gonna charge me yeah
Britany my invite got lost in the mail
like like come on guys I don't
understand why this so rude
but uh yeah I mean I because I need to
see those prices because I have no idea
Oh Melissa primers $32 is that for a
fenty are you talking about Fendi look
at my comments again Oh trend mood just
dropped it
oh thank you girl whoo
okay okay yeah I will plant I'm gonna
put it in Wednesday's will I buy a video
foundation 36 that's not bad I expected
a lot more for a foundation to be honest
30 shades of foundation mmm
okay yeah I will put it in the will I
buy for this coming Wednesday like I
know it's gonna go on sale tonight at
like midnight or something like that but
I mean it's just I couldn't I couldn't
put it in a will I buy it because I had
nothing to talk about other than it was
Rihanna's makeup line I thought that was
all we really knew until the teaser
started coming this week but Cassandra
says have you done a video like 50 facts
about you maybe when I know when I first
started I did a lot of tank videos like
a lot because well yeah I was kind of
like what the heck am I supposed to post
you know and Amy says no foundation for
you know there's that I don't need
anymore
I so many foundations I have so many
foundations I need to try I don't know
what happened but I did a lot of tag
videos when I first started and that's
something that I always recommend to
like I just I didn't really know what to
say
and I didn't have a huge makeup
collection so I was like I don't really
am I suppose to be like reviewing or I
don't know what I'm supposed to be doing
so I didn't ton of tag videos so if
you're just starting out you're trying
to go with video ideas tech ideas or it
was really fun so let's see
Nikki says I have to study for my
nursing exam so I want to log on tell
you I love you to support you so much
and will very much later thank you that
is so sweet and good luck good luck okay
let's see ya know okay so a lot of you
guys are talking about who forty shades
forty shades of foundation for Fendi
damn that's awesome
Brittany says the brushes look like Kim
K's I kind of thought that too for when
I saw I just saw like the photo of
everything and it does kind of have that
like nude feel that I kk w Beauty TAS or
whatever but it already smells like the
prices there are butter as though oh oh
most of you just tag me off sweet thank
you thank you thank you I will check
that out once I am done randy says what
is the worst foundation you own I don't
oh I don't own it because I heard wait
where did I get this one I tried the
Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation I got
it in that social a box they aren't
around anymore but social I you could
order it was like a subscription box but
you could get samples of high-end makeup
and I tried it out and I got the Marc
Jacobs remarkable foundation and oh man
I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't oh yeah
yeah I could not do it
I was so thankful because I really liked
the idea of that box it it just
disappeared one day it was gone like
they shut down and they were over with I
love the idea of them though because I
always wanted to buy that Marc Jacobs
foundation and it's super expensive and
so I got to try a little sample of it
and I was like oh no no no no no no no
no it was just too full coverage on me I
think a lot of people liked it but it
was so full coverage on me even I used
like the smallest amount ever
bird Mike I mean it could have covered
my entire face and my chest and my
shoulders and my ears and my big ears
it's so like that's saying a lot and it
just felt heavy it was like one of those
foundations that felt heavy it looked it
looks like I was just wearing a ton of
foundation like it was not pretty
Amy says not makeup related but I am a
librarian and guess whose book I got
today was a book did you get today what
did you get today
that's so cool around librarian that was
one of my first job it wasn't really a
job I volunteered but I worked at a
library and I would like put the books
away you know people return their books
I would put them back on the shelves
that was one of my first like volunteer
jobs I don't even know how old I was
maybe like 12 maybe like 12 let's see
Stacy says hi from Pittsburgh so
distracted by holiday releases any
favorites so far tart has caught my
attention tart caught my attention they
have like an I said it had lashes in
there and lash glue lash glue that
luster lobster Katie always talks about
and then there was two other things in
there like some sort of glitter but I
really didn't care I got it
you caught me out lashes and lash guy
treats that I was like done and then
also I just saw on trend with the other
day that so for our favorites is
supposed to be coming out with a really
really big give me some lip collection I
don't remember if it was give me some
nude lip or if it was all different
colors but it had a ton of different of
different lipsticks in there so I was
really interested it was like $68 maybe
but there was like five full-size
products and I love those lips Ed's
so I'm super excited about that one
let's see
what do you say everyone keeps howling
my skin looks nice
thanks guys I have on the estee lauder
double wear water foundation is what I
am wearing today let's see I felt like
there I felt like I saw a question Oh
Katie says Sam you told you to do that
Club video with Olivia she tagged you on
Instagram
yes we are doing it so I've been reading
to to bring that up because we are doing
I wish I could look at my Instagram
right now we are doing I think we're
gonna do like a full face but like using
our subscribers or followers favorite
makeup so I know if you go to her
Instagram which I believe is just live
loves her makeup she has a post up there
like you know it's like one of those
like typed out posts on her Instagram
and you can comment below and I wasn't
sure how I was gonna have people tell me
what they wanted to see because you can
either comment or you know just snap it
to me our Twitter Twitter's probably a
really good Wike so I'm on Twitter like
24/7 I'm at by Samantha March but if you
let me know your favorite makeup that
you would want to see me try out I think
it's good I think we're doing like a
first impression vibe I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna have to check I think we're
gonna do it in October but we did talk
over a snapchat and I was like yes I'm
down with this I'm down with this idea
so we're gonna do that so you guys gotta
let me know your favorite makeup that
you would want me to try out in that
video and I'm super excited for it I
think that was such a good idea yes I'm
so excited okay
Melissa says that you like other items
from Marc Jacobs me too I like like
everything else from Marc Jacobs I was I
don't know why I'm so shocked that I
didn't love that foundation but I love
everything else from Marc Jacobs so
impressed like so impressed but no not
to that foundation Lily says do I have
the 35w morphe palette I don't think I
do I think they did sentence me in a
our package which is like super cool but
I think that is the one I actually sent
to my niece when she moved to college I
think that was the one that she said
that she wanted so I'm pretty sure
that's the one I sent to her let's see
Oh Amy says oh you bought a questionable
friendship yay I hope they love it thank
you so much thank you
oh that's so cool a questionable
friendship was the third novel I wrote a
third one my third one third novel I
wrote and it's a real toss-up between a
questionable friendship and my latest
one defining her like which one's my
favorite I had so much fun writing a
questionable friendship it was so
different from the first two books I
wrote like it was just really different
and and it was a lot of fun to write I
felt like I had more I feel like I had
more confidence for sure writing that
one because it was my third book and
like I just know yeah I just felt like I
had more confidence in myself and in my
writing and I felt like I also got to be
more creative because my first two books
took place in Iowa and the third one
took place in Maine so I spent all this
time researching I still have never been
to Maine so I got spent so much time
researching and and doing all these fun
things for that book so I had such a
good time reading that one so thank you
I'm oh man and that is my my book that
became a best seller on Amazon which is
always like I can vividly remember that
day well it was named Patty's Day it was
st. Patty's Day and we were out and
about and I was with mage I was with my
little brother John and I was watching
it on my phone and I saw I get to number
one and I was like what just happened
and I'm so cool so cool so cool number
one in the in its genre in the women's
fiction genre and that number one like
over Amazon overall that's that's a big
difference
so let me clarify that big difference
Ingrid said is that you in the cover of
your new book I am on the cover of up to
I do it's Mitch
and eyes actual running photo on that
one that's my fourth book and it is on
sale right now on Amazon for $0.99 if
you like ebooks I put it on sale to
celebrate it being our anniversary and
us being on the cover the book has
nothing to do with our wedding or any
our book art our actual story is not in
that book at all but but we are on the
cover
yeah we are on that one so let's see I
feel like I talk fast and then I like
forget to breathe that's oh I keep
skipping on me so much let's see what
happened
I'm also asked what's on my nails it is
totally yours from Sally Hansen Nicky
says do you want your own makeup line in
the future you know I have never I've
never really had that consideration I
feel like it has to be insanely
difficult to start a makeup line I mean
I don't I don't think that's easy at all
and I know that there's a lot of is it
called private labeling I could be wrong
but I know that there's a lot of that
that you can do and you can basically
just have these other companies
basically do it for you and you kind of
you buy it and you put your name on it
and I'm just not I mean I would not be
interested in that at all if I'm ever
gonna like start something and do
something like it needs to be all me and
I would have no idea I I truly have no
idea how to start anything like that if
there's anything I would like to do it
like I would love to be able to create
like lashes because I love lashes so
much I think that would be really cool
but once you get into like things like
foundation and even like eyeshadows and
just like everything that has to go into
something like that I mean I don't see
in my future to be really to be really
honest I don't um I love like marketing
and PR like that stuff that I really
enjoy and if I were ever to like try to
do something because sometimes people
are like what are your like goals with
your YouTube channel and things like
that like I would love to start a PR
firm or you know something like that
that's more of where my interests lie
and also where I think my strengths are
because I've worked in marketing for
almost 10 years now on the book side of
things so I don't know I just I don't
know how people do it I saw that like is
it Laura Lee and Kristin Dominique
Christina Kristin Dominique that are
starting makeup lines I've seen people
like say it and I've seen like YouTube
like thumbnails that say it but I've
never actually looked into it because I
don't follow either God myself but I
would love to know because I'm not I'm
just curious I've also heard that
Jacqueline Hill is starting her own
makeup line but that I feel like I've
been hearing that since before I even
how do you know so so I don't know but I
don't know I don't I don't necessarily
see it in the future I feel like I
definitely need some sort of partner and
I don't know who I'd partner with and I
don't know oh no oh your dog died last
week that is the saddest thing I'm so
sorry
that breaks my heart hmm Amy said did
you ever get some real food to eat had
some Doritos and I also had some purple
skittles so no so no would be that
answer so disappointed in myself
I'm disappointed let's see
jinzo's what shade are you in the Estee
Lauder Double Wear I want to say it was
like pebble is that a shade pebble I
think that was it you guys I'm like I'm
overloaded with foundations right now so
I'm kind of getting confused about stuff
Marie says do you film every day what
does your husband think I thought almost
every day I don't film a lot on the
weekends because mish does work a
regular job so he's gone you know all
day um and I get to do my own thing and
and hang out and stuff so I film almost
every day during the week a lot of times
I don't film on the weekends and what
does my husband think I don't know he's
into it mitch has always been very Mitch
has always been very supportive I've
been with Mitch for 10 years we've been
married for four years today but we have
been together for 10 years and I think
he kind of always I mean I feel like
he's always known that I've never wanted
to do something super traditional I've
always been that person that I wanted to
try everything I was just thinking about
it today actually um I thought I wanted
to be a travel agent so I worked as a
travel agent for a couple months I
didn't love it I wanted to be a wedding
planner so in turn into one summer with
a wedding planner and I was like no no I
don't like that either I've always
wanted to do so many different things
and and it's fun now though because I
can take a lot of those job experiences
and I can actually put them into the
books that I write which is super fun um
but I feel like he's always known that
about me that I've I've always been out
to try to find what makes me so super
happy and I think that he understands
that I have found it I get to write
books which I have always wanted to do
and I get to do YouTube and not that
when I was nine years old I said I
wanted to be on YouTube because YouTube
Austin thing when I was 9 years old but
I I love being able to do this I love
being able to connect with people and
talk to people every day that's
something that that I've always wanted
to do and I just I just I just love it I
love I get I get excited to wake up
every day and go to work and I
understand that not a lot of people can
say that so I feel extremely I feel
extremely lucky but sometimes I try not
to say lucky because I worked really
really hard to get here I worked really
hard to get here and that was not luck
let's see no Lauren says defining her
was so good thank you I'm so glad that
you read it oh let's see Jen says what's
my favorite writing style for me
personally I typically write women's
fiction and alright
Harris is barking I write a lot about
like friendship friendship fiction and
things like that but I'm really into
reading thrillers right now I'm reading
a lot of thrillers I'm trying to do
better about posting on Twitter what I'm
reading and if I'm reading something
good but I have definitely been reading
a lot of thrillers I think because I'm
currently writing my sixth book and I'm
like completely like in the zone writing
and sometimes when I'm writing I can't
read in that same genre because I like
pick up on different things or different
characters personalities and then
Allison I can see my writing change so I
try to read outside of the genre that
I'm currently writing if that makes
sense
so I'm reading a lot of thrillers right
now except that ain't nothin ain't
nothin about what I'm writing I would
love it write a thriller but man I
promised myself I was gara myself let's
see okay Theresa do purple skittles
Kona's fruit that's almost healthy right
so for four years the like have you guys
seen how for wedding anniversaries
there's like gift ideas if you just like
google it and there's a modern and
traditional and I looked up for years
the other day and it was the traditional
traditional that was fruit and flowers
and the modern was appliances so much
today it came in and he gave me flowers
and then he gave me purple skittles and
Milky Way and he was like this is your
version of fruit and I was like you just
understand how can we get them read
together
because let me would have like brought
me a thing of like bananas I would have
been like yeah wait thank you so I got
my my fruit my fruit and my flowers so
Oh see see
thank you I'm getting so mad my comments
cuz it keeps like jumping to the end but
I'm trying to to read everybody's and
see if you guys got any questions or
what you guys want to talk about Genesis
I actually received a notification for
the live feed
that's like shocking to me I can't
believe it let's see oh so Jen says

remembering to do that Amy says you
should do a series on what you're
reading maybe include in your monthly
favorites video yeah I actually did for
the first time last month I'm filming my
next monthly favorites tomorrow I think
for August because I'm just super behind
but I did it for last month I featured
all of the books that I gave 5 stars to
out Amazon which is the highest rating
that you can rate a book so I can keep
doing that if people like that idea
like Ken Jackie says I just finished
reading wicked for hire Jackie are you a
book lover because I think I'm reading
that one too I have that one coming up
shortly here
I guess earlier about the Knicks
elements pallet what do you think I'm

right now

week I kind of talk to bottom but I'm
I'm waiting until they come to Aldo so I
can use my points repel slots Congrats
on your anniversary thank you Jackie
says I'd like to see more of your
husband you guys want to hear a funny
story about my husband I'll tell you so
uh we floated the river on some day we
went to float it was on our bucket list
we've had our summer bucket list and
we've been working so hard on it and we
were supposed to float the weekend
before we went out of town to Nebraska
for her friend's birthday and we're
gonna camp and float and they ended up
canceling the floating because the river
was too high and it was so crazy because
we walked into the the campground and it
was right by the river it was really
cool and I looked at the river and I
went that is super high and super fast I
can't believe they're living people
float no wait wake up the next morning
they're like yeah floating is cancelled
I was like wow like it was insane it was
it was absolutely insane so I was like
oh yeah I know that one worked out um so
then we were super bummed about I'll
shoot you know we had that on our bucket
list and time's running out to float the
river so we did the following weekend it
was me and my husband and then our
friends man Shannon and we're floated in
the river and we're on the bus so you
get to the place and then they bust you
to where you get in your tubes and then
you float down and then you're getting a
bus and they bust you back to your car
so we're on the bus and I'm sitting
there with Mitch and I look over
and I'm like oh we didn't take our rings
off I still had my wedding ring on
he and his wedding ring on I was like
well
whoops like probably should have taken
our rings off but whatever you know
floating I'm not planning one getting in
the water at any point it's not like I'm
at a water park or anything like that or
jumping in the water even swimming I'm
literally just gonna sit in my tube so
I'm like okay no big deal like should be
fine we're nearing the end like we can
actually see the people waiting for us
but we met up with another group and
we're like let's just stop at this one
sandbar we still have a few more minutes
so we stop and we meet with this other
group and it was two other couples and
they're like oh we're getting married
and March one of the couples getting
married in March oh cool and somehow
people start talking about wedding rings
and Mitch takes his off because Mitch's
ring is actually was actually a wood
grain it had wood grain inside of it it
was pretty crazy but he loves one he
like does woodworking and stuff so
that's his wedding ring and so he takes
it off and the guy's looking at he's
like oh cool it much puts it back on and
a few minutes later the guy throws much
a football and he goes to try to get it
and he lands in the water and he comes
up he goes I lost my ring I thought was
like lose your ring it's really not too
big of a deal because his ring was $40
on Etsy not a big deal at all
like we reordered one it ended up being
$46 with tax and shipping so it wasn't a
huge deal by any means but I was just
like dude I even said it I even said oh
no we didn't take our rings up and he
lost his ring but what's even funnier is
he actually had a backup ring he when we
went and picked out ring this he picked
up he got a ring we literally got home
from choosing our bands and he was like
I don't like it I don't like it so we
went back like a week later and he
picked out a different ring and we got
married like that was the ring that he
was wearing on our wedding day and all
of that and he still was like I don't
like it like it's just not me it was
just a plane so
ring she's like I don't like it so he
found this woodgrain ring on Etsy in
ordered it and I'm like whatever so he's
always just had this silver ring like in
this trucker or whatnot so he started
wearing that ring while he's waiting for
his new ring to come in and he's like
isn't it funny that the the day of our
anniversary I'm wearing the ring that we
actually got married with come on yeah
maybe we shouldn't wear our wedding
rings near open water yeah but I mean
it's a lot better that he lost his ring
then I lost my ring because I would be
really upsetting videos forty six
dollars for a new one so it wasn't too
big of a deal by any means but that's
what happened when we went flooding so
but how did I get started on that
conversation um someone said that they
wanted to see more of Mitch where did I
lose my comment said hey he's not really
like a big social media guy he doesn't
have a Facebook page he doesn't have
Instagram like he doesn't have I think
maybe he has put I don't even know if
yes Twitter to be honest like he's just
not a social media guy so I don't know
it he's not really like a camera person
either like he doesn't pick his pictures
he doesn't he doesn't take his pictures
he doesn't like to take pictures and
things like that so I don't know I I
don't I really don't foresee him in the
near future giving in a video with me
like he's been in some of my vlogs like
when I when I blog it's not like he's
like no no no no photos no no like he's
not like that
but I have a really hard time picturing
him actually sitting down and doing some
sort of video with me I just I don't
know maybe sometime down the line but
but I don't know I love that you guys
are all talking about books that's so
cool but Jackie okay you did sign up for
the book okay so I was like what
decision I'm reading working for hired
to I run a blog to her company if
anybody has a book blog you can check
out CLP blog tours and it's
you get books in exchange for reviewing
them on your blog and on the Amazon and
things like that so that's what I've
been doing I think I started seeing
people on tours in like 2011 and that's
basically book marketing so that's why I
said I've been in marketing for so long
now at least isn't back from eating and
walking my dogs hello welcome back Jen
says alpha stepping up their game on
their products I got an F package today
guys I have I've been so busy I wasn't
even able to show you but I got a up
here package from elf and they sent me
that like bubble mask I've been wanting
to try that bubble mask for so long I'm
so excited that was really cool I was
pretty stoked to see that so that's
pretty awesome and else is coming out

they're coming out with a new product
every single day in September and I just
got an email today about coming out with
new liquid lipsticks that's pretty cool
that's pretty cool I'm into that see
Jacqueline says congrats on your
anniversary and shut up from kids
ehome's
dude dude I it I don't even know what to
say that was like one of the most
bizarre things ever because I remember
being on snapchat and I was looking at
all of my stories and I can see Casey
Holmes's name but I can tell it's me and
I'm like what happened to my snapchat
like my snapchats going crazy
and so then I click on it I feel like
I'm gonna cry just got really
overwhelmed I don't think I really
overwhelmed but oh man I kept trying to
screen I kept watching it why I was like
no I'm on I'm on the run I'm I'm not
watching he's the closest snapchat I'm
watching somebody else doesn't have chat
I'm watching my own snapchat saying that
I love me check out my channel like
what's happening here and then I kept
trying to screenshot it but my hands are
like why is kiss me a home watching my
video
like how is this even possible I had
loved Casey so much she was one of the
first I I know I've said this before but
she's she was one of the first youtubers
then I started watching and I feel like
at least for me and you know we all have
our different opinions but at least for
me I feel like she is still the same
person that I was watching you know two
two-and-a-half years ago when I first
started watching YouTube like III feel
like she has not she I feel like she
hasn't changed I feel like because I'm
actually getting pretty flustered with
with some youtubers and and how you know
I don't want to get in too deep of a
conversation but I'm getting I'm eating
frazzled by some people that I've always
really supported and I've always really
been down with and then you just like
you know some things happen and stuff
but I just I feel like Casey doesn't
change like and I think that's really
really cool so to know that someone like
her has seen my videos and and and just
and just took the time to say they're
just taking the time to say that she
watches someone who I mean that was
really really like really crazy to me
you guys I mean I mean even if she
wouldn't upset it on like her snapchat
what happened some of you are asking
what happened Casey had a snap the other
day it was I had just posted my video I
think it was on Tuesday I just posted my
video and Casey put on her snapchat you
know I love Samantha's videos go check
out her channel and I was like me what
and it was really wild to that a couple
days before that Casey did a snapchat
she was talking about one of her videos
that she just posted and I was watching
it and you could see cuz she was showing
like her YouTube video and you could see
the right-hand side of her YouTube page
rip am i back sorry sorry I think it
kicked me out we're at the 40 minute
mark
YouTube was like you were talking too
much I
would cut you off so I apologize I
apologize for that so I was watching her
snaps and then so on her right side
where it says like watch necks or like
requested videos I saw one of my videos
and I was like oh my gosh like how are
my videos popping up like hey Casey
wolves you should watch this video and I
send it on my snapchat and so many
people wrote in and and they were like
that means that she watches your videos
and I was like no she does and so then
it was just a few days later she said
that I was like wait what what I'm still
incomplete and like total shock I just I
really am I've been working on an email
to Casey
since that day so it's only been like
two days but I feel like it's been a lot
more days but because I just want to say
I'm just trying to explain like thank
you and it just it it means a whole lot
to me that she watches my videos it does
and I'm just I'm trying to explain it
without sounding like a crazy person I'm
trying my best I'm gonna email her just
you know I said something on Twitter and
I said something on her Instagram and I
said but I'm trying to write I'm trying
to write her an email just being like
people do but you know like not in a
creepy way so there's that Stern shrine
that's a big great be okay someone else
who is Casey um she is another youtuber
Casey Combs is her name if you haven't
checked out her channel you really
should she has a 1.5 million subscribers
I'm pretty sure and she just did a
collaboration with Smashbox and I was
watching one of her videos the other day
and she was taking questions and someone
asked her are you doing another
collaboration and she did that whole
like maybe you know thanks I'm like we
should go having with Nick's I'm so
excited I'm so excited she was someone I
was so excited to support her and her
her palate sighs she came out I bought
the
palate which is so good so good like so
good and I know like I did not I did not
need a highlighter even back then I
should have been on a no-buy but I was
like I still have to buy it I have to
buy it because I just love her so much
though that was really really really
cool
let's see Stephanie asked if I use
artificial lighting because it's getting
darker and cloudier what I have
recommendations besides natural lighting
I have a ring light so I actually have
like a ring light on right now because
it's it's it's making now so there is no
light so I have a ring light and I have
two soft boxes I bought the soft boxes
first and I just bought them off Amazon
and they were like $70 I want to say for
two soft boxes
wait Jessica's here that's good or know
I miss my comments just a beauty 89 hi
oh hello
that's really overwhelming to you ah
that's so awesome
oh man guys it gave me all hot bothered
over here as my face getting redder
Jessica says what I want to know what
made you start your channel in the first
place so actually when I started a
YouTube channel I am 53 uh when I
actually started a YouTube channel it
was as a book channel because I'm an
author and I'm a book blogger and I kind
of
it could be just kind of an extension of
my blog and when I started chiclet plus
in 2009 which is my blog I wanted it to
to be all of my interests in one place
so I wanted it to see books I wanted it
to be beauty and I also wanted it to be
fitness and it was actually really
frustrating to me because as my blog got
more popular and as I look and then that
would bring people to my blog as well I
kept getting told that I wouldn't be
taken seriously as an author if I
continued to talk about makeup and
fitness and celebrities and have those
types of articles on my blog and that
was really frustrating but it also it
scared me so many people told me that
like other authors and other book
bloggers were like no one's gonna take
you seriously in your writing if you
continue to talk about the best
foundations and so I shoved all of that
because I'm like oh my gosh no one's
gonna take me sirs I've been working so
hard to write these books you know I
paid a lot of money for an editor and
you know all these things like I want
people to take me seriously
so I basically shelved everything like I
redesigned at chiclet plus so I took
away like the lipstick in the logo and
the there was like a yoga mat and the in
the logo and I was like taking it all
away and we're only gonna talk about
books and I always got it I was always
very frustrated with that because I let
other people tell me what to do and I
still get really upset with myself to
this day that I let other people tell me
what to do and tell me how to run my
stuff so when I started YouTube I was
like okay so I'll get on YouTube and
I'll still talk about my books but I
want to bring back why I started chiclet
plus I want to talk about all of my
interests over there so I would do like
to book videos like reviews are like
showing like book mail because I get
like books from authors and publishing
houses and things and then I was like
then I'll do one beauty video and I kept
seeing as I started
my beauty videos were doing so much
better than my book videos and it was oh
it was so strange to me because I had
already been in the book community for
so many years and I just I don't know I
guess I just kind of assumed which is
really you know you shouldn't do that
but I just assumed people from my book
world would come over into my YouTube
world and they didn't but I also started
getting the comments again of I can't do
makeup on YouTube if I want people to
take my writing seriously and I was like
we're still on that we're we're still on
that so this was like 2015 I want to say
2015 I'm like we're still telling people
what to do and and how to run their
lives and how to run their careers like
really so that was really really
frustrating to me and then I just kind
of had this thing where I was like you
know what I worked so hard on my blog
and you know I write I write reviews and
I and I do these interviews I'm I'm
always editing for a client or writing
or doing some sort of marketing I was
like I'm gonna revamp my YouTube channel
and just become solely focused on beauty
because my beauty side and my passion
for reviewing makeup and talking about
makeup got pushed down pushed down push
down for so many years by so many other
people and I was like no no I want to
bring that back because it's always been
something that I've been so interested
in and something that I've always wanted
to explore and now I have a platform to
do it and more people it honestly is
still shocking to me to this to this day
it is still shocking to me how much like
love and support and the beauty
community that I got that I didn't get
in the book community and the book
community people are telling me you
can't be this you can't be that you
can't be yourself basically and it's
interesting to me that in the beauty
community people are like you got a girl
you can do this you can do that you can
do all of these things and you can do it
it's shocking to me and I know a lot of
people say that there's so much
negativity in the beauty community
there's competition and there's this and
there's that and I and I see
it I I see it and I get it but I feel I
also feel like the beauty community is
freaking awesome I feel like there is so
much support over here I feel like
there's people constantly trying to
bring you up and make you better and
help you out I can come to so many
people in the beauty community and ask a
question and say I need help
I'm confused about this how do you do
this and people answer and a lot of
people answer and I've seen in the book
community you do the same thing no one
answers and it's been it's been a very
very interesting to me to learn all that
I still love the book community and I
don't I'm not trying to hate on that
community because I still have so many
good friends over there too but it was
something that was very interesting to
me so that's why when I was saying
earlier that I feel like I'm finally so
happy now because I'm doing all of the
things that I wanted to do and I don't
feel like I I don't feel like I'm
listening to the people and now that
tell me if I want to be this I can't be
that if I want to do that I can't do
this because I'm someone who thinks I
can do it all I can do whatever it is I
want to do I can do it so there's that
that was a really long story that was a
really long story but it really is just
a lot of those things that I said it's
just things that that I find really
interesting in and I know I know that
people do think that you know there's so
much bad in the beauty community and
sometimes we only see those really bad
things but I really am here to tell you
that there is a lot of good things
happening there's a lot of good people
in this community as well there's a lot
of people that want to help raise you up
like I I truly truly think that so I
mean for just coming to be here with my
live chat and saying to me to have Kacie
home sue I shot like there's so much
good there's so much good you guys that
really really is so
move it move all right now okay let's
see what uh what did I miss in the
comments so you just go through the
comments we are at okay so we're at 54
minutes so I will have to uh I will have
to pop off pretty soon here just I think
you're only supposed to do like an hour
I I hope that you guys like that story I
hope that you found it inspiring because
I was so unhappy for so long like and I
and I was frustrated with myself because
and I was like I know I've always loved
writing I've always wanted to write
books and I'm doing it so why am I still
unhappy why am I still feeling like
there's more I'm supposed to be doing
that that was the feeling that I always
said to my husband I'm supposed to be
doing more I'm supposed to be doing more
and he was always like what what do you
want to do you know what do you want to
do and you can do it I'm like you know I
just want to do that's what I kept
saying you guys I can remember having
like a breakdown I was 25 I was 25 and
I'm like I can remember telling much we
were on vacation in South Carolina
visiting my family and I was just crying
to him in our hotel room I'm like I'm
supposed to be doing more I'm not doing
enough and he's like you've published
two books you've started your own
business like what do you what do you
mean like there's more out there I know
there is though so there's that I love
that you guys are saying in the comments
that you feel like there's a lot of
positive comments in here that's really
awesome that's that's like kudos to all
of you that's that makes me really
really happy
yeah Stacy says lipstick yoga mat
Chiclets bugs its head on my people yes
not always like why you know cuz I love
Chiclets my blog is you know chick lips
plus and my my blog I named my blog
chick-lit plus because I wanted it to be
like more than just books more than just
writing more than you know that's what I
that was always my intention with my
blog so then when all of a sudden it
started getting more more popular and
stuff and people are all I go on you
can't talk about this I think what do
you mean that's that's always what I
wanted to talk about so that was a
bummer but okay
I feel like we talked about a lot I feel
like we talked about a lot in this video
let's see Casey says I originally found
you from the video where you shared why
you started a YouTube channel that was
so inspiring and I clicked with you
instantly that's so cool thank you
that's so cool let's see Thanks I'm glad
that you guys are connecting with with
that story Amy says smart babes who like
lipstick yes I'm glad that you are and
sometimes I get really frustrated with
myself because I'm like I wish I would
have realized that sooner I wish you
know I wish I didn't have all of those
years being so you know I want to say so
and happy I mean there's a lot of good
things happening but it was just that I
was trying to figure out what else I was
supposed to be doing and and you know
like if I just would've actually started
a YouTube channel I'm like 2013 2013
2014 it was after Mitch and I got
engaged I started a YouTube channel and
it was supposed to just be like vlogs
about my wedding and I always think to
myself like what if I want to actually
kept at it back then like what if I were
to kept at it back in the day but I
didn't I did not have a lot of
confidence in myself at that time so I
like hated seeing myself on camera and
watching back those videos like I barely
post them anywhere else I was like no
nobody can watch that so so that's me
let's see huh it keeps skipping around
my comments so much I'm trying to catch
up what's up everything that you guys
said if someone said my brows are
looking Bob's thank you thank you so
much
I keep trying out that I'm the SunZia
brow Wiz I just don't know I just don't
know anything about it guys I don't know
oh let's see
and Talia says it's not a it's not a
coincidence that Samantha's getting
attention from women like Casey and
Jessica positive strong women that's
really that's a really cool comment
thank you for saying that
um but yeah that's I just I just I
really do want to see more of that
sometimes and that's why I got so looks
like so happy when when I saw the
comments saying that you see a lot of
positivity in the comment section on my
videos and that's what I like hope to
attract because I know that sometimes I
can look through some comments and I
don't want to say it reflects on the
youtuber because it really doesn't and
sometimes if you just get to such a big
number you can't help it like you're
gonna drag in the negativity no matter
what but sometimes I read through
comment sections I'm just like what
happened so I really want to be I really
want to be someone who who attracts how
do I say Liz I want to be someone who
attracts other strong women and people
who do want to build each other up and
you do want to leave positive comments I
think that's really cool yeah that's
really cool so let's see Camille says I
just joined where's my girl areas she is
my gosh I wish I could show you guys her
shield laying on the she is laying on
the couch is loving a life right now she
looks ridiculous Janelle says you live
in Iowa did you grow up there I was born
in Visalia California
I lived mostly in Iowa though I went to
high school there and then I came to Des
Moines
for college uh we move around a bit
though my sister is married into the
army so and she's eight years older than
me so she got married right when she was
18 and I was 11 and she started moving
and I always like to go visit her like I
spent like a whole summer in North
Carolina one time and things like that
but yeah okay I do need I'm just I want
to see if I'm missing any other comments
yeah Rebecca says trolls or trolls
everyone has them at sad but true
it doesn't yeah it definitely is I mean
like I said I don't think it should
necessarily reflect solely on you know
the youtuber or things like that because
you know once you feel like once you get
to like a million I wrote it over like
you're just going to kind of kind of
have you're just going to have that but
I just I get really happy when when
people say that my comment section is
positive or you know if I look at
someone others comment section and I see
like you know the positivity and things
like that I think that's really cool so
so remind reminder trying to stay
positive
oh let's see Sydney says can I say it I
love your Willie Bennett series it
really brings perspective into
consumerism and it helps me make smarter
but it's cool that makes me really happy
because that's that's kind of why why I
wanted to do that you know it was Aries
of snoring so loud it was definitely a
spinoff from from the anti ha series for
sure but sometimes I just felt like I
felt like anti house could have like I
have a negative vibe and I tried to be
as positive as I can I know I'm not
always I'm not always I mean hello they
gave me beef in my nachos instead of
chicken how do you be positive about huh
hey damn Doritos for dinner uh-huh yeah
that's I kind of like to see the willow
diets instead so okay
I think I'm I think we are done we are
now over an hour so thank you guys for
coming by another live stream I
appreciate it so much I had so much fun
hanging out and I'm excited to watch
this back because I feel like I can't
even remember everything that we talked

thank you guys so much for coming and
hanging out with me and spending time
