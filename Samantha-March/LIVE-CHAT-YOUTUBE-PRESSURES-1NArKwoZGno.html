you're gonna have a great live chat when
it kicks you out within one minute of
going live that's really that's good
that's fantastic so well we'll see how
the gobos it let me go live I literally
said hello and it boom gone
okay so happy Thursday everyone welcome
to another live chat I'm just gonna pull
up the chat here so I can lapse the
questions and calm has come in whoa I'm
in a different setting I typically do my
lives I was doing them in my kitchen
because I thought they were better
lighting wise for when I still had my
red office and it was just so dark in
here
even with I have the ring light over
here I was like um I just thought it
would be too dark so I went into the
kitchen and then I stayed in there a
couple times because baseball games are
on but no baseball game Cubs are out so
we're in the office and I think it works
pretty well I don't know you guys let me
let me know what you think about the
lighting and such I just have the ring
light over here and then laptops over
here so I can try to be watching the
comments too so that's what we're gonna
do I have my tripod just up one notch
but I still feel like you still feel
like I'm really short here so happy
Thursday everybody hope you are having a
great day and here comes Larry and uh no
no I don't even have a table for you to
say that no cuz you're gonna knock my
phone over you want to sit on the chair
I'm gonna see very little sit on the
chair thank you everybody
right no sir that chair well then don't
be mad at me okay
so this week
my god okay then um this week we're
going to be talking about the pressures
of being on YouTube and kind of just
like social media in general I did the
Twitter poll and that's what was voted
on it was voted a lot I think it was
like 54% voted on seeing this video so
um the eyeshadows that I'm wearing today
are from the morphe 35o 2 and the Justin
Hill palette I basically just recreated
Jaclyn Hills I think it was called her
purple and rose gold
smokey eye that she had in her YouTube
channel that's what I did today it took
a really long time and it's telling me I
have a really bad connection so I'm
probably going to get kicked out at any
point out I don't know I feel like I
watched so many live streams and like I
even watch live streams um like on the
replay I never see people have this
problem like getting kicked out of
YouTube lives and I get kicked out I
mean I've already been kicked out once
and we've been on for three minutes so
I'm like why it missed me my internet
but it's just really annoying but there
is no no I don't know what to tell you I
got nothing for you I'm just gonna turn
to ignore her and see what happens so we
are talking about the pressures of being
on YouTube and social media in general I
have been on social media since 2009 was
when I started my book blog which is
called Chiclets Plus and then you know
from having the blog I started a
Facebook page and Twitter page and all
of that so that's kind of when I started
getting into social media and whatnot
so long time eight years eight years
I've I've been in social media game and
seeing how it's evolved and all that fun
stuff do you want to come up on the
chair no I don't know what you want
let's see if she'll come up on the chair
come here okay okay
sit down though you have to sit down you
have to sit down though because I have
to talk to the camera I swear I like
she's worse then having a child cuz like
seriously okay please please just this
is a livestream and um I just please
stop asking questions about the giveaway
I thought like every third comment is
about my giveaways and I can't see you
like the actual comments that are coming
in because of those comments no like I
don't what's just very strange to me
so anyways so we're gonna be talking
about the pressures of being on YouTube
and I kind of made a list but then you
know I would kind of want to see brands
those dog mount problems yeah um yeah
Amy I it's just very strange um Gary I'm
gonna stop start ignoring you again sit
down okay Wow so oh I'm just
get it done yeah down down
it we're just gonna try to ignore Aires
because I did that one other time and
she finally just fell asleep and went
away so we're gonna try that again
so I'm sorry if you hear her whining but
this is this is what's happening right
now so I had a couple pressures that I
wrote down and I figured I'll just kind
of start about 1:00 and then you know
kind of come in and see what you guys
are saying and you know maybe what you
guys think the pressures are or a few
guys are in social media what you think
some of the pressures are and just kind
of see where we go from there she
listened act the entire tripod over Oh
Megan says I just love your puppy
oh me too right now me do okay so I feel
like one of the pressures okay I feel
like one of the pressures that I feel
like is I feel like youtubers especially
I'm gonna especially talk about you to
persons for on YouTube but I feel like
there's a pressure to like we can't make
a mistake ever
for some reason youtubers always have to
be be perfect which is just it's it's
strange to me you can't make a mistake
you can't mess up you can't say the
wrong thing you can't do anything wrong
because people are just waiting for you
to make that mistake they are just
waiting waiting waiting and it's
something that quite bothers me and an
example that I'll give is a couple of
weeks ago like these are the things like
like my goodness so sorry those are very
bad connection again but I did a video
about maybe like a month ago I did a
lipstick de-clutter and in the video I
talked about over 200 lipsticks cuz I'm
where I kept like 150 and I declutter
another like 50 son so I talked about
over 200 lipsticks in that video and
most of them I recalled the names
without looking at the lipsticks I
talked about the finish are they mad are
they creamy what's the long where did
they smell where I got them I mean all
of this off the top of my head I
misspoke on one lipstick out of over 200
lipsticks I had a bite Beauty lipstick
in there I own three by PD lipsticks two
of them are in honeycomb right honeycomb
now I feel like I should look because
heaven forbid is okay again let's see
yes
honeycomb I have two of these in
honeycomb which I renewed and then I
have one from fight and uh whiskey which
is really dark so when I was going
through the video I pulled out whiskey
and I said it was honeycomb I can I need
more than two hands to count the number
of comments on that video that was like
a girl that was not honeycomb that
something's wrong with your honeycomb
you said that wrong like and I'm not
trying to say that all of them were rude
comments some of them were like actually
calling me a name because I called the
lipstick a wrong shade which was strange
but not all of them were mean comments
but so many I'm like out of this entire
video and me naming over 200 lipsticks
you found the one mistake I made the one
mistake I made you and like I feel like
a pressure is that I feel like people
just watch our videos and just wait for
that slip-up wait for that mistake that
the wrong name we said when the lighting
goes where I mean just anything they're
just looking they're just looking for
you to make a mistake and it's just
crazy because I feel like that's that's
a really big it to me I feel like that's
a really big pressure because it's just
it's just frustrating when you when you
put so much into a video so much time so
much effort so much whatever and then
people find that one time that you
stuff and it's like you can't you can't
make a mistake you can't mess up you
can't misspeak you just can't because
people are just behind that computers
just waiting for it and that's really I
feel like that's really hard I feel like
that's a pretty tough pressure and
that's it's kind of one that I thought
that's kind of one that I thought of
right away so I don't know there's that
I'm gonna try to read the comments I
have to have my usually my laptop's more
in front of me but now it's over to the
side because uh because I'm in my office
here so see ya like even me just sitting
here doing a live I've already been told
by people that my lipstick is too pale
that I'm gray on gray doesn't match and
blending it I mean like I mean that
that's the thing that I'm saying like
there's a bigger there's a bigger
picture here I mean more than what your
makeup looks like and what your outfit
looks like there's a bigger picture and
it's just strange to me that people just
want I feel like people just want people
to fail I feel like we live in the
community that like we love to build
people up but then we like to see them
crash and burn like that's that's how I
feel and across not just people you know
even just like on social media I just
feel like in general we it's like it's
like our society wants to see people
fail we want to see people mess up
because why do we have all of these why
do we have all of these YouTube channels
about spilling the tea and exposing
people and you know we have all these
negative channels talking about how
people messed up when they said the
wrong thing when they did the wrong
thing
where are the channels that are that are
bringing people up that are saying this
person did a good job where are those
channels cuz I'll subscribe and I will
watch those videos but I don't see those
and all you see is
the negativity and you know it's like
one person does something wrong on
social media I was gonna say in public
but like on social media and all of a
sudden we forget about all the great
things that that person has done we
forget all of them they could have been
the best person their entire life they
make one mistake they're done they're
done and I'm like how how do we do how
do we do this and I'll state I'll stay a
specific example here I was gonna try to
say I was specific examples but I'm kind
of on a roll but Tarte cosmetics is a
brand that I really enjoy I liked hard
I've liked heart for a long time but
like tarp since before I had a YouTube
channel and they do really good things I
feel like they have the kiss and make up
campaign where they're always trying to
talk about the exact subject kind of
that we're on right now it's
cyberbullying they created the storm of
love after they um after thee the
hurricanes hit they had storm of love
and they're raising money and you know
donating it and all this stuff and I
know that they put out something bad on
Instagram and I don't want to try to
downplay anything bad that happens I
really don't and I know somebody's gonna
come at me for that reason but they put
something not acceptable on Instagram
and just everybody blew up and everybody
you know I'm getting messages I can't
buy anything else from Tarte I need to
boycott Tarte you know all of the the
the channels are you know exposing Tarte
and all of these things and I'm like how
come we only hear about all of these bad
things but I don't hear anybody talking
about the the kiss and makeup campaign I
didn't hear it like fair it was very
shortly after that that they came out
with storm of love I didn't see anybody
else talking about that except for the
influencers that were actually like
involved with it there were the only
people that I saw even even talking
about it you know I put a tweet out
about it sounds like where why isn't
anybody talking about this why isn't
anybody like trying to get the donut
and you know trying to use our awareness
it's because we're all we're too busy
waiting for the next company or the next
person to make a mistake so we can make
the videos about it because that's what
we want to see we want to see the
negativity we want to see people fails
say ha you failed
done with you it's really sad to me
honestly it's really it's really really
sad I don't know that's one thing I
think I'm all riled up
but I don't know that's just one thing
it's it's it's hard and that's hard and
that's a bummer to me so ok let's see
what yes oh so you guys are saying
McKenna says it's so weird to be talking
about the pressures of YouTube while
people live or roasting your makeup and
outfit isn't that true like it's uh it's
just yeah it's just interesting um let's
see I'm just gonna be reading some of
the comments here so don't mind me sorry
I have to turn so much but other than
that I was gonna have to put my laptop
on my lap I mean left up on your lap who
does that that's crazy oh let's see
huh then my comments skip around what do
you guys say I hope they'll live like I
hope this connection is going okay
because I like every four seconds it's
telling me I have a bad connection
[Laughter]
so Darcy Ann says you're still right so
many aspects of people's lives are on
social media so all the viewers and
people across the world can talk about
how awful they are like really like
sometimes that that's what it feels like
I mean yeah it's like you put on a penny
I don't know man it's just Haley says
they wouldn't say that to someone to
their face technology makes people
forget were human sometimes I definitely
I definitely can see that it's it's you
know it's so much easier to just talk to
write an email you know not not saying
things face-to-face that's for sure
that's hard man Oh Margaret oh so you
love my nail polish it's a OPI sweet
caramel sundae this is my nail polish
let's see
yeah so like a lot of you guys are
saying that you know you feel like you
can't make mistakes and that's yeah but
that's really is my biggest thing is
that you just you feel like you can't
mess up that's like a huge pressure that
I feel I feel like I can never mess up
can't ever make a mistake Blue Ivy says
it sells it makes the ratings and I feel
and I totally I totally agree with that
and it makes me sad like that's what
that's what has to get our ratings these
days but it makes me sad like I really
dislike the shows like the the housewife
show I remember like trying to watch it
when it first came out like so many
years ago and it literally was just it's
to me from when I saw the couple
episodes it was like just women against
women women fighting against women all
of the time and I was like this is a TV
this is really what we watch this sucks
like that's sad we're what like how is
this such so a popular show it's let's
see
okay I feel like I missed a bunch of
comments again because it always skips
around though um vs does this ever make
you reconsider sharing your life on
social media or aspects of it anyways it
definitely does does it make me
reconsider when sharing my life I don't
I
I'm a person that I haven't always liked
put everything out there and you guys
might know like I don't even share I
don't share my husband a lot I don't
necessarily like hide him but he's not
really on my social media a lot you
don't see him on like my snapchat and
stuff a lot and I feel like maybe
there's parts of my life that I try to
protect a little bit more and keep a
little bit closer to me because then
people are just out there you know
nitpicking your relationships and things
like that and it's funny because I I
watch Katie and Desi you know very like
I watched both as I watch their snapchat
siren you know
all of that and it's like they'll even
say when they're not together for a few
days that people are like Oh Katie and
Desi are fighting and they're writing in
like speculating why they're fighting
and all these things and it's like man
like that sucks you know so I don't know
I'd almost feel like if there was a time
where you know from it wasn't on my
snapchat for so many days he would be
like her marriage is in trouble and then
it's like huh
so um yeah I feel like I share a lot I
mean I always have shared a lot but I
don't share at all if that makes sense
and like even a lot of times when I'm
around like like my family members like
when my mom was here I think I snapped
in one time with my mom and I had a
filter on her you know like oh that was
a good question though and see
anna says can you imagine meeting a
stranger and telling you girl your
eyeshadow is not properly blended oh
great
like my thing is is that I can't I can't
quite imagine like just going out to a
random person like out at a mall or
something and like going up to them and
being like oh excuse me your eyeshadow
not good not good since I'm just walking
away like huh how's that happen I just
can't and you know what maybe there are
people out there that do that I know I
had a youtube friend she shared a story
on her snapchat once about like running
into someone at a store and the person
straight-up said to them I don't like
your videos and I was like oh whoa so
there's probably definitely people out
there but I just I can't imagine just
going up to someone that you don't know
and just being like your makeup not good
today
and then just walking away like what
that's like
would that be so weird okay what's going
on Liz says do you feel like you have to
look and dress perfect for every video I
feel like I feel like at first I almost
kind of did like when I first started
out I really would take a lot of time
and like I would put consideration into
like the clothes I was wearing and all
of that stuff and like I would try to
have like a clean background and you
know all of that stuff and I feel like I
felt like that at first and now I'm
almost kind of more comfortable like
almost but it's still but now it's
almost even like more fun for me to do
my cuz when I first started I wasn't
like the best at makeup which I'm still
not the best I make it by any means but
I really wasn't all that good at it and
now it's fun for me like this this eye
look took so long today oh my gosh it
looked so long today but I was having a
great time doing it while I was doing it
so it's almost more fun for me now too
to play with makeup because I feel like
I'm you know getting better at it or at
least feeling like I know more so it's
kind of strange because it's like in the
beginning I felt more pressure for that
and now I'm just kind of like I'm more
like late laid-back about it
you would think it would be the opposite
right but hmm
Lynette says I think I would run out of
tops there have been times where I have
worn a swimsuit tops in my videos
because I was like oh man I feel like I
always wear the same shirts and I had a
top that you couldn't tell in the video
that it was a swimsuit top because it
had it was like regular straps and
everything but I've done that I've done
that before
and let's see I feel like I'm I feel
like I'm not quite as much in the
comments um because I'm like getting
getting on long long winded things here
but I'm gonna try to come back in and
see a lot of you guys are saying the UM
the housewives are your uh guilty
pleasure that's funny yeah I'm going to
try to keep the topic focus on what
we're talking about just cuz I feel like
I might have a lot we're already 20
minutes in you're gonna hurt Aires
drinking the water it's funny I'm gonna
try to keep on topic just cuz otherwise
can kind of get all over the place
so let's see
good step goodness
so Lisa says I feel like if you do not
agree with an influencer or enjoy their
content than just don't watch their
videos I never understand why people
post negative comments repeatedly on
someone's videos I agree with that I do
you think it's kind of strange
um because sometimes I'll watch videos
and I'll go to leave a comment and it's
almost kind of like you can recognize
the same names over and over in the
comments section and they're always
saying like the same like nasty thing
you're like why are you still here it's
like I guess I can never figure out why
people watch people that they don't
enjoy cuz like when I get to a point
where I'm not enjoying someone else's
YouTube channel then I just stop
watching them you know that's what I do
because I don't have time for that so I
so I don't know I wish I knew why people
do that but um yeah if you don't like
watching someone just don't watch them
just kind of move on good gracious this
live chat it's getting interesting
tonight guys woo okay do you got that
one my goodness okay don't we think last
week was going to be the crazy week but
it's actually going to be the say my
goodness Pam says do you sometimes feel
pressure to post all the time or
schedule or risk losing your followers
I am yeah that's I can't wait to tell my
husband about those oh and those and my
friends fantastic about those lunch
oh it's something different so do I feel
pressure to post on a schedule I feel
pressure but I have that pressure on me
because I'm someone who I have to abide
by a schedule I have to or literally my
day is in shambles and I've always kind
of been that way like from this time to
this time I do this and then from the
center this time I did this that's just
how I have to have my days so I have to
have my youtube schedule but I don't
feel pressure from from anyone else to
post on
and you sort of like particular basis I
put that pressure on me so it's good
question um let's see
I usually someone else how long I do the
live chat for I usually stick around for
like an hour so we'll see see how it
goes
although my comments keep sticking
around and now I saw another question
I'm not see crystal says I used to never
even comment because the first time I
complimented a youtuber I got tons of
hate on my responses for that compliment
simply because they didn't agree
that's awful Wow Wow I totally get that
and wow I I get that because there's
been times it hasn't happened much to me
but there has been certain times for
like I've commented on someone else's
video and someone has like someone's
like disagreeing with me and I'm like
what like okay so just move on with your
life goodness gracious oh I wish I was
keeping up with the comments better
because I'm not but Katie Katie Katie is
on it Katie is my moderators she's here
every week with me and she does such a
fantastic job she if you just click on
her she's the one that's Katie Maurice
has up what to call a trench I think is
what we decided it was a wrench fire if
you click on there you can go over to
her Channel and subscribe to her she
just has a thousand subscribers so big
congrats to her so go to her Channel and
tell her that she's awesome cuz she
always does such a good job moderating
this video okay let's see here
Mel vs. are you worried about gaining
followers and then gaining additional
hate it seems like the more followers
the more hate yeah that's for sure and
you know definitely something that I've
noticed you know going from 0 to the
30,000 it's something that worries me
for sure but one one thing that kind of
bothers me too like kind of on the same
subject as of this is that you kind of
constantly hear that because we're in
social media like this that because
we're on social media and such we should
expect hate we should expect these bad
comments we should act like it's part of
the job and that just kind of frustrates
me because I'm like why is that why I'm
genuinely cute I've always been kind of
been curious about that because you see
how like celebrities and stuff get
treated like I would be horrified oh I'm
back sorry okay they kicked me out of
course but what I was saying is that
what celebrities like I feel like you
were to be horrifying if I just ate like
a burrito and chips and salsa and three
margaritas and then I leave the
restaurant with you know a food baby and
then all of a sudden you know my picture
is plastered across all these websites
the next day with like circles you know
around my stomach she's expecting I'm
like oh my gosh like some things that
you see what these celebrities go
through and I'm just like oh um but it's
just weird to me that people say that
you know this has to come with our job
this is a part of it and I'm like can't
we just be better at being human beings
like can't we can't we just be better no
that's nothing we can't do that it's
just so strange to me so oh man oh man
let's see
oh yes
she was crying in the background but now
she has laid down so maybe it'll last
yeah so Amy says you're human for crying
out loud I don't think people remember
that and I feel like that's true like I
don't know it's strange to me how people
can put people on social media and I'm
not just talking about youtubers but you
know cuz I saw it even before I went on
YouTube the thing is that people would
say about like authors and stuff because
if you guys don't know I've been in the
book community since 2009 I'm a
published author and I'm a book blogger
and I would read like book reviews that
you know readers would leave for authors
and there's so many times where you read
a book review that they're not even
reviewing the book they're roasting the
author which is like incredibly strange
so I saw that even before I went on
YouTube but it's like why do we put why
don't we put people that put themselves
out there why do we put all this
pressure on them to be a certain way in
you know I mean that's something that I
I truly want to know I don't have an
answer that question that's something
that I want to know it's just it's it's
strange I remember I would I was so
scared to publish my first book because
I was like oh my gosh people are just
gonna roast and they do I mean I just
had a review in for my latest book where
the with the reviewer talked more about
me then they talked about the book and
I'm like hello hello I don't know I
don't know why that happens
ah
so oh let's highlight about flowerless
says I have so many friends who want to
start a channel but are afraid of the
hate it's really sad yeah I can
definitely see that I can definitely see
being afraid because one of the
questions I feel like I get a lot is you
know is it scary to put yourself out
there and yeah I mean yeah it definitely
is because people are judging you on
every aspect my clothes and my makeup
and like the decisions I make the food I
eat what I spend my money on what I
don't spend my money on
I mean it's wild they judge legitimately
every aspect of your life the fact that
I don't have kids my gosh let's judge it
all the time
goodness because you can't be 30 and not
have a child without having something
wrong with you I'm crazy let's see
so I'm just waiting era just reading the
comments here you guys have a lot of
good things to say and um you know we're
we're live so the live chat will
disappear after this video goes up as a
regular video but if anybody like if you
have a comment that you feel really
strongly about or you know things like
that the video will re upload as a
regular video once we're done with this
one so if you'd want to come back and
leave any of these comments because
there's some good comments in here
there's some interesting comments in
here yeah but there's some good comments
in here if you guys would want to leave
it on the regular video so let's see
these says do you get easily annoyed
with all the tips and suggestions
subscribers leave and your video comment
threads even if it might be R on the
edge of being constructive some people
mean well but I'd go nuts and honestly
it can get hard and you know I I feel
like a lot of people are trying to to
honestly be helpful and to give
constructive criticism but sometimes it
gets to be a lot and again I'm only at
the 30,000 mark so I can't imagine what
some of the other people go through but
every single day someone tells me that
you know especially when I have the Red
Room every single day I got told I
needed to paint my room every single day
I need to change my background I need to
change my hair you know it's so strange
I get the comments like you'd look
better if you had all brown hair I mean
I've had people tell me you would look
better if if you were a redhead I mean
you you get all of these like different
comments and again I know that some of
them are truly I feel like are truly
trying to be helpful but I feel like
when you get so many comments in one day
it's just like no but you feel it's like
you feel them all all going on your
shoulders like you're not going to know
that this this isn't good enough your
makeups not good enough what like it
does it gets to be a lot that's a good
question it definitely gets to be a lot
and I try it sound
bad almost but like I tried not to pay
too much attention to them even the ones
that I feel like are constructive
criticism because it's just too much you
know obviously I mean if I tried to put
into if I tried to take every single
comment from someone and change who I
was
and what my room looks like and did it
all of that there's no way that you're
winning I mean there's no way that you
can do that and there's no way that
you're winning but it's just that is
that that's the big that's a big
pressure because everybody has in their
mind what they think is best or better
for a person or etc etc but everybody is
so different so everybody has you know
oh I think this is better than this and
this is better than that so you can't
please everybody
there's just no no way at all possible
that you can please everybody but
everybody wants to be pleased everybody
wants you to be like what they want you
to be like and you just can't do that
it's it's an impossibility but it does
it's a lot of pressure it's a lot of
it's a lot it's a lot that was a good
question
um let's see
um you know and there's stuff like
there's lots of pressures to it because
I know I've seen some of you guys asking
about like physical appearance and stuff
I feel like there is definitely a lot of
pressures to look a certain way to for
sure and and that sucks I mean I feel
like that sucks um I feel like one of
the most comments like that I see when I
you know am on another channel and
whatnot and I'm looking through the
comments
it's your lips are too big you know this
is on other people's channels and
whatnot but like your lips are too big
or your filler girl looks bad or you
know things like that
and it's just interesting because this
was this was months ago but I remember I
had a comment come in on YouTube and
someone said to quote you need to lay
off the lip fillers and I was like I
don't have lip fillers I don't even feel
like I have that big of lips but it was
interesting to me about that comment
because it wasn't even someone saying
like oh did you get lip filler because
your lips look filler it was you need to
lay off the lip filler
hey if I want to get lip filler I'll get
lip filler and that's not your problem
that's my problem and that's what I want
to do but when we leave those nasty
comments to other people about their
appearance I'm like that's awful but
then I was like how did I just really
over line my lips today or why is it
look like I have so much that I've never
had lip filler but again it goes back to
you if I want it then if I want to do
anything with my body whether it's cut
my hair or get plastic surgery that's my
decision
you know from big to small it's my
decision what I want to do and I feel
like it's really hard because it's like
you feel pressured both ways though
because I've also been told that I
should get lip filler you know I've been
told that I need a nose
I've been told all of these different
things and so it's like people there's
some people who feel like you need to
look a certain way but then there's
people where it's like so then you know
people do get the lip fillers and they
do get this done because you know
because they want to do it but at the
same time I'm sure all of these comments
coming in to them
I'm sure that has to play a part I'm
sure that it does you know I can't I'm
not speaking for anybody but I you know
I'm sure that has something to do with
it especially being on social media and
I can see being in the beauty community
needing to look a certain way and
whatnot but then it's like they do and
then it's oh my gosh she got lip color
and she's just trying to fit in she has
too much lip filler or she has she's too
overdone this and that but it's just
like again it just goes back to you
can't win you know you can't you can't
win it's either your lips are too big
your lips are too small your eyes are
too big your eyes are just not your nose
is too big your nose is too small I mean
it's just it's it's it's straight-up
body shaming but we see it every every
single day we see it every single day
and that's hard that's hard I say it a
lot and I always feel really old when I
say this but I am really glad that I
didn't have social media when I was like
in middle school high school I don't
know how it's one of the things that
scares me about you know possibly
becoming a parent in the future I'm like
how do you parent for stuff like this
because you hear you hear oh hey Lisa
you you just you hear such sad sad you
just hear sad things it's crazy but oh
okay let's see here
yes anna says that spider shaming is
just rude who gives anyone the right to
discuss how you look
yeah it just I really is I mean you
can't win oh yes Amy says the lucky
comment yesterday that you snapped that
was ridiculous I put it on my on my
snapchat but someone wrote in on the
video I think it was not my cult
favorite makeups and I had a very like
pastel I look on in a bright pink lip
and someone said how often do you
actually go out in public and makeup
like that and she had previously left
another comment that was something like
I can't remember what the other comment
was but if something about like
professionals when it where'd this kind
of makeup well I I work from home so I
don't go into the corporate setting so
it wasn't like I was doing a makeup
tutorial of how how to dress up hurt how
to dress off how to dress for work and
you know all of these things it wasn't
many sort of tutorial it's just the
makeup that I wanted to wear that day so
this person had already left a nasty
comment and then and I deleted it and
then she made another comment of how
often do I actually go out in public
like that anytime I want I went out to
dinner that night with my husband with
my pastel makeup on and my bright pink
lip went to a friend's house that's why
I wanted to look like that's what I look
like like it doesn't matter it shouldn't
matter what I want to look like it just
because I don't look like what you want
me to look like why does that matter you
know well the note says I wish someone
would tell me my lips were too funny
Haley says I would not do well with that
one me comment and I'd be a crying thief
it's definitely hard I mean you do you
do have to have a thick skin to be on
social media and and that was something
I realized you know very quickly when
starting the book vlog and like getting
on Twitter and things like that it was
definitely something that I realized
right away and I mean I feel like over
time and over the
years I truly just feel like it's just
looking worse and worse but that's why I
always try to encourage you know I try
to do like my very small part and
encouraging just doing like leaving some
sort of positive comment if you can
every day whether it be on YouTube or
any other form of social media or just
someone that you see in person can you
text someone and tell them that you you
know you hope that they have a good day
just anything because I feel like I feel
like it's so easy to spread the
negativity and and to spread the the
nasty comments and you know let's just
all try and do our part and in trying to
leave some sort of positivity every
single day that's what I think that's
what I think I don't mean it like I
don't want to like try to like I don't
want to sound like I'm being like really
preachy and stuff but this is stuff that
I truly think about every single day if
that that goes through my mind every
single day Beauty adding next door Alex
she says it's sad that at a certain
point you just expect the name of
negative comments to come your way I
just saw myself that it's not me it's
them yeah it is it's that's sad joe says
people believe comments like that are
just unhappy with their own looks and
have low self-esteem that definitely
could be it - that definitely could be
it which sucks you know I feel like
that's I feel like that sucks
let's see I can't it's just kind of
skipped around again
what's really like it's kind of making
me sad that I see a lot of comments in
here about like wanting to start YouTube
are wanting to start something but a lot
of you guys are saying that you are
scared because of the negativity I feel
like that's really I feel like that it's
just really sad that people have to be
too afraid to like chase after their
dreams or you know go after their goals
because of all these pressures that's
really sad honestly yeah Brady says
social media would have caused me so
many issues I already struggled with the
low self-esteem and body issues I think
it would have been bad and I wouldn't
have been able to overcome my
insecurities it's true it's just it's so
scary for me to think because it's just
scary for me to think about having
social media like even as a teen that
scares me man
I don't know how I don't know how we can
do it these days I don't have kids so I
don't know like are they just used to it
I don't know man it's hard so brandy
asked do you feel pressured to be like
the big youtubers do you feel pressure
to have to be like them or to want to be
different than then that's a good
question um do I feel pressure to be
like the big youtubers kind of in a way
which is something that I also think is
interesting because you know because I
was talking about when I had like the
red wall you know I would get so many
comments of you know my background looks
ridiculous and all these things and you
know I need to have the white walls and
you know I need to be like the big
youtubers with the white walls or get
the backgrounds there all of that and it
was kind of an interesting thing because
when we moved into this house four years
ago the this is this is an office and it
had the red wall and I hated it like
when we moved in I was like why why do
they have a red well I always felt like
I was in a cave and it had been on our
list since day one to repaint this
office and especially for me I just
especially in the wintertime it would
just you know we would go without
sunshine for days and days in Iowa and
then I'm sitting in a Red Room that just
makes everything darker just going crazy
so it had always been on our list to
paint this room but then it was funny
because I would get the comments saying
like oh you need to paint your room and
I almost kind of did that like well I'm
not gonna pay my room like like it was
almost like I was like I'm not gonna pay
everyone just those people want me to
pay my room I'm gonna have a Red Room
till we move out of here and then I'm
like no you don't want a red room you've
wanted to paint this office for a very
long like just so it was kind of funny
because I almost kind of like
flip-flopped it around like type of
thing I did the same thing with my brows
people always got mad at me when I
didn't do my brows and instead of like
continually trying to learn I was like
I'm just not gonna do my breath then
like like that's my response to things
which is not good but uh but obviously
we did end up painting which is so funny
because Mitch walked in here the other
day and it's like it looks so much
better in here like why did we wait so
long to do that and I'm like I don't
know um but yeah so it's like you do you
feel pressure to have like the stark
white background and like all these the
Alex 9 drawers and and all of that
definitely but then at the same time
people are like you know you need to
like be yourself you need to be your own
person and the hawk Taylor like it's
2017 and I feel like we were supposed to
be embracing our differences and how
we're not all the same yet at the same
time you get so many comments of you
need to be the same you need to have the
same background you need to make the
same videos we need to look the same you
need to browse the same I mean someone
actually commented on my Instagram once
and said why don't you do your eyebrows
like all the other instagramers do and
like I didn't realize we had to all look
the same that seems weird right like why
do we all have to be the same so it's I
don't know it is kind of like
it is it is kind of like you feel
pressure to have the same background and
setup as all these other ones but at the
same time like trying not to lose your
identity and I remember like talking to
my husband about painting the office and
whatnot and he was like just please
don't paint it white and I was like oh I
would never pay my office white like I
need some sort of color in here you know
a type of thing and I wasn't going to
lose that just so I could like fit in
with other people or you know people
always tell me oh you just need to get
like the sparkly backdrops I'm like what
is perfectly back job hey I don't have
any place to put it look where would I
this office isn't that big where are we
gonna store all these backdrops and
things and then setting them up like I
film every single day I don't have time
to have a whole production in here like
that's not gonna work um yeah that's I
think they're okay
Arius is going crazy with her cave isn't
makeup and beauty supposed to be
different in individualized yeah that's
what I think I like we're we're supposed
to have our own we're supposed to just
be our own people especially now
especially how far we've come it's just
weird that people want to see us as like
robots to each other it's very strange
it's very strange
let's see I feel like another pressure
that I have I know we're at the
15-minute mark but this was one that I
wanted to talk about - I feel like
another pressure that I have with having
like a beauty YouTube channel is I feel
a lot of pressure to buy a lot of makeup
but then at the same time it's like I
feel pressure not to buy a lot of makeup
and like how do I explain this money so
especially because I post my will I buy
it every single Wednesday and I talk
about the new makeup releases and which
ones I'm gonna buy and which ones I'm
not gonna buy and I get so many comments
and I typically talk about four items in
each video and typically or when there's
videos where I'm not gonna buy any of
the four I get so many comments of like
oh there she goes again
by any makeup why does it bother you
why does it bother you how much makeup
I'm buying why does it bother you what
I'm spending my money on yeah maybe I
didn't buy any makeup this month because
I had to spend hundreds of dollars
painting my office and buying all the
supplies for it maybe I can't buy makeup
this month like sometimes I just can't
buy a lot of makeup I mean I don't know
why I don't know why it's I don't know
why it's other people's business of what
a what I spend my money on in general
but be why it bothers people so much
when I say that I'm not going to buy
makeup but then at the same time if I do
a whole video and I show all the makeup
I bought from Sephora and although it's
oh my gosh you see how much makeup she
mom she is so materialistic can't
believe she just wasted all her money
and all that makeup oh my gosh it's like
but like you you can't win you can't win
like it's it's it's wild it's that's so
that's a big pressure because it's like
yeah I feel pressure to buy the makeup
but at the same time I feel pressure to
not buy too much makeup because then
people are gonna get mad at you either
way it's it's it's interesting yeah if
you said you were gonna buy everything
oh I lost comment I shoot yeah Sara so
that's a catch-22 it definitely is oh my
gosh past beauty is here we try to look
nice oh goodness Babs beauty hi one of
my favorite channel hello she says
people say they like originality but
look at the top influence are same
slangs I'm Cartier bracelets and Gucci
bags people seem to like people seem to
like to watch Guru's who portray a
fantasy lifestyle
it's true it is it's it is it's so true
thank you for coming here that's beauty
oh my gosh thank you so much um try not
to like jam that Zilla trying to like
keep us together you know okay give it
together so you can do it um
Jacqueline Rice's I get so much hate on
my halls and people tell me I don't have
any sense and I'm wasting all yeah it's
great it's I mean I I feel like I've
never had people care so much about what
I I've never had people care so much
about where my money goes I feel like
people on YouTube care more about how I
spend my money than my husband does and
we have a joint bank account like they
have to really they have to tell me what
to spend my money on and what not to
spend my money on and all this stuff
like it just it's so strange to me but
yeah that's a big pressure and I feel
like another pressure is PR stuff we had
a very interesting conversation and
snapchat today about PR and whatnot and
why people get so angry over PR packages
and all that stuff but it's like weird
because I feel a pressure to review even
like people always want to see these
reviews I get asked to review every
single big release every single one I
can't buy every single really is out
there it's just it's it's not in the
realm of possibility but I get asked to
review all of these things and then when
I get so lucky to be able to be on some
of these PR lists and get some of these
packages and then I review them people
are like doesn't matter you got it in PR
don't believe a word you're saying and
I'm like what am I supposed to do what
what am I supposed to do then like how
do you win how do you win they're like
I can't like no you can't win her either
because people people always angry about
PR which is which might actually be next
week's live topic if you guys don't
follow me on Twitter I'm at by Samantha
March and I will do a poll I usually do
them on Tuesdays but I have an idea for
next week's chat and it'll be similar to
this one
bev speedy says you will never be able
to win unfortunately I feel a pressure
to buy legit everything and do a snap
haul every day reality is I can't afford
that and I already have way too much
makeup well your staff out there like
the best ever of life you literally
maybe like scream last night so Babs
Beauty I was watching your snaps like
late at night and hummus and you said I
watched Smith of March I was like Mitch
Mitch comes running in my office like
what what happened that happened that
I've been last night but yeah it's it's
true that's they want to see us buy
everything but they don't want to see us
actually buy anything they want to see
us review everything but we can't get
anything in PR because in our reviews
don't count it's it's it's a it's a
never-ending it's a never-ending vicious
cycle really it just really is oh let's
see
Oh skip around my comments oh he says he
watch my belly my thank you oh thank you
oh my godness keeps giving around I
can't see everything um yeah I really
hope I hope um the pr subject gets voted
on for next week because i feel like
especially about snapchat today i've
never taken so many notes on snapchat
that i have today from all you guys and
learning so much it's been super
interesting but
okay sorry I thought I saw another
question about feeling pressure hold on
yeah Alyssa they never understand why
people get so angry about youtubers
getting PR I see it as motivation to
work harder if there some day that's
true too
when we have the the chat about PR a lot
of people said that they think people
well sorry my comments always skip
around so much it drives me crazy I know
a lot of you guys are saying like you
know you can't you can't win over
everyone and it's true I mean it's
definitely true you can't you can't win
them all and it's just kind of something
that you have to uh I don't know if I
want to say it sucks because I feel like
every single night when I go to bed I
feel like I have let someone down and
that's hard and it's something that is
it's it's almost hard to deal with
there's so many nights where before I go
to sleep I cry because I feel like I let
somebody down I didn't do good enough
for somebody and it's because you get
these these comments and these and these
messages basically telling you every day
how you failed in some way and that's
all just stuff on social media and then
you got to think about your real life
too like oh yeah I remember to text my
brother today but I forgot to call my
mom or I remember to text this for him
to make Frant and make plans but oh my
gosh I forgot to his friend back like
it's hard I legitimately somewhat you
just very bad ok so we're at an hour so
we're going to wrap it up anyways sorry
that it's getting so choppy um but thank
you to everyone who came by for the live
chat I'm sorry that my streams always
get disrupted by YouTube but I feel like
that's a really bad thing to end on
because it's you know I feel like that's
a really bad thing to end on so maybe
maybe YouTube cut that part out because
that was kind of negative to end the
stream on but you know to to wrap it up
there's a lot of pressures being on
YouTube and being on social media
there's a lot of pressures every single
day you know not feeling good enough I'm
feeling like you have to be a certain
way but at the same time
social media and starting a blog eight
years ago completely it's a little girl
it's allowed me to have friendships with
people all over the world with people
that I would you know not meet had it
not been for social media and I
appreciate that so much so there's a lot
of bad in social media but there's a lot
of good at the same time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
