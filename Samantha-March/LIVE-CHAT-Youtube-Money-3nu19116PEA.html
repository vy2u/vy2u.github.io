going live I'm trying to figure out I
don't know yet how to like find my own
land video because I wanted to add in
like links to this description box but I
don't I haven't figured out how to do
that yet so I was hoping if I just went
to my channel it would be there so I
don't see it though I don't get it what
am I doing wrong what am I doing wrong I
can't figure this out literally I don't
see it anywhere
how do people watch themselves live I
don't I don't know okay well I was gonna
try to have some links in the
description box so you guys could see it
but apparently I shocker I don't
understand technology that's that's
really not surprising at all but hey
everybody how's it going we're here for
another live video I do post a poll on
Twitter hi everybody I post a poll on
Twitter every week and I ask what you
guys want the topic of the live chat to
be and the ones I got I think was like
42% of votes was a YouTube tips video
and talking about money high your first
live I'm talking about money yes I do
have to disclaim some just that they
like my makeup I thank you so much for
that and um bye this is so boring
kick bye so leave like um what was I
gonna say oh I just filmed a uh oh hey
Katie Katie is my moderator today yes
yes remembered to get a moderator um I
just filmed a makeup challenge video so
if I look a little bit crazy it's
because you shouldn't film a makeup
challenge video before you go live
that's that's really not a good idea so
like my brows are probably a lot of
weird things going on but you know what
we're just gonna have to make it work so
let's see um okay so just looking at the
Commons okay so we're talking about
money so I did ask on like snapchat and
Twitter - South Africa asked on snapchat
swear if anybody had
specific questions I could kind of start
off with but as your questions come in I
have please take people after this
challenge what challenge Mickey the oh
the one that I did the one on my face
that'll be Saturday's video if it turns
out okay um so I did ask a few questions
and then if more questions come in I
have paper and pen here so I can write
them down so I can talk about them
the one I just don't yeah it'll be up on
Saturday so it'll be this weekend for
this makeup challenge that you're gonna
find out about because that was very
interesting so we're talking about
YouTube money okay here we go
um one of the questions that I feel like
I get a lot and it might be like a
really basic boring question but I've
gotten it so much from people who are
like starting a new YouTube channel is
when you go to sign up for Adsense which
is one of like I'm gonna keep writing
down questions as soon as you sign up
for your YouTube channel I think that
you can sign up for Adsense you might
not be able to do Adsense until you have
like a hundred subscribers maybe but you
can sign up for Adsense and it's free
basically Adsense is when you see the
like little ads or commercials before a
video or you see a little pop-up boxes
that come in that is all throughout
Adsense and a lot of people make an S
how long will this livestream be I don't
know usually between 30 and 40 minutes
I'm on alive so somewhere around there
so you can sign up for Adsense it is
free but a lot of people are concerned
about signing up for Adsense because you
do have to give your social security
number and you also have to get like
your bank information I've had so many
people message and ask me I you know I'm
trying to sign up for Adsense but
they're asking all this information and
you know totally you know be concerned
when people are asking for you know your
information like that but with Adsense
it is tied to Google who owns YouTube
Google owns YouTube and your paychecks
that you get from Adsense are from there
you basically are like a 1099 employee
when you have the Adsense because you'll
get a paycheck you know once you start
earning the money feel good
every single month and it's directly
deposited into your checking account so
that's why you have to link it but at
the end of the year you will get a 1099
statement from Google I got mine last
year it comes directly from Google as
like your employer basically and you do
need to submit that in to your taxes so
that is something important to do and
that's why you need to have your Social
Security your social security number on
file and why you have to link your bank
account because that's how you get paid
through Adsense so I know that might
seem like a weird place to start off but
like the number of questions I get asked
about that is really really high and you
know I say it's safe I mean a lot of
people get paid via Adsense and I
believe that it is safe someone says I
keep breathing I'm sorry I don't have my
I have my mobile data turned on like I
didn't last week so hopefully we'll have
a pretty smooth live stream and people
asked where you sign up for Adsense if
you just Google Adsense it'll have
something in there that you can link
your account you have to link your
YouTube channel and things like that and
then put in all of your information so
you'll want to do that I'm pretty sure I
mean I've had my youtube channel for a
while now but I think you maybe have to
have like 100 subscribers and have your
account being good standing in order to
use Adsense Thank You Katy oh my super
chat is on thank you I'm sorry if people
say keep buffering anything is frozen I
don't know why I don't know if you want
to go out and try to come back in but I
don't know um okay I'm just reading all
the questions yeah a lot of people
wanted me to talk about taxes as well
taxes are really fun thing um so last
year was my first year that I had to do
taxes for YouTube okay so Cady says it
was freezing and just hit refresh so
yeah try to try to hit refresh if it's
frozen or to go out and then come back
in so for Texas if you do make over I
think it's either 500 or $600
from really anything any sort of
employer that's sending you a paycheck
you do need to submit it for your taxes
I'm speaking for America I am American
I'm not really sure how taxes work in
other countries but for America you
would have to submit those 1099s for
your taxes $600 okay so if you make over
$600 they do need to legally send you a
1099 tax form and you submit that to
your accountant or if you do your own
taxes so there's that and kind of once I
started making money off youtube I
definitely did start doing write-off so
a lot of people have asked about
write-offs I mean I'm I'm self employed
full-time anyways I'm a published author
so I was already writing off a lot of
stuff like I write off you know part of
my mortgage and you know my utilities my
internet my phone all of that can be
written off and I just keep spreadsheets
and everything that I spent throughout
the month but once I start at YouTube I
mean I documented my camera my tripod
the makeup that I buy things like that
even things like newsletter feeds I have
a newsletter that goes out every single
month and it's like fifty bucks a month
or something I put that in my
spreadsheet and I write it off I do have
an accountant I feel like once you start
like I used to do my own taxes for me
and my husband and it was fine but once
you kind of start getting more into
things like self-employment and write
off and things like that it's really
nice to be able to have a professional
help you out and tell you what you can
and cannot write off so that's what I do
um there's a lot of things that you can
write off and I just try to write off as
much as I can honestly and have my
accountant tell me if I can't hurt him
huh do it so um that's what I do come
tax time but I try to be really diligent
myself and keep a spreadsheet because
that's how like I want to keep track of
where my money's going I also want to
keep track of the money that's coming in
so any time that you know I have my
youtube paycheck that comes in once a
month I'll put it in a spreadsheet so I
can see it or like if I do a sponsor
video or something when I get the
paycheck I put it in because I like to
be able to see
how much money is coming in and how much
money is going out so that's a little
bit about that um a man that would you
ever get another dog a friend for Aires
maybe I don't know dogs are a lot of
work especially visualize they're very
they're very high-energy so everybody
hi everybody that's coming on um I did
get asked how soon do you start making
money it really just depends um with
Adsense if we go back to talking about
Adsense the kind of the main thing that
I see okay kind of the main thing that I
see and the info that I hear when I
watch other videos is like you get $2
per every 1000 views is kind of like a
good base that you can kind of project
it off of so um $2 per every 1000 views
is kind of the normal I guess it's what
I see most people saying like most
people who who know more what they're
talking about than me you know obviously
I'm not like a professional or anything
like that I don't know all the answers
but typically what I see so that's kind
of like a starting off point um that I
could maybe give you but I mean I
probably had my channel for I don't even
know you guys maybe like seven or eight
months when I started getting money I
would say so Adsense is definitely a
good way to do it and you know it's free
to sign up and there's really not much
that you have to do you just you know
say that you want to monetize your
videos and YouTube does it from there
but it's also never any sort of
guarantee because just like two months
ago they wouldn't they're something
called like what they call the ad
pocalypse or something like that
something happened was someone's channel
they put out like a controversial video
but it was monetized and a bunch of
people got mad and a bunch of employers
or a bunch of advertisers pulled their
ads from YouTube and I was kind of like
wait what the heck is going on because
all of a sudden I mean my revenue cut in
half and I was like what is happening
here and it was because a lot of the ads
were being pulled out weren't even
showing on videos
things like that so I mean it's never
any sort of guarantee or any sort of
guarantee paycheck so it's definitely a
risk that you have with YouTube
you cannot someone just ask if you can
monetize every single YouTube video you
can't if you have any sort of like
copyrighted music in your videos you
can't monetize them a lot of times they
will pull your monetization I know Liv
loves our make up was just talking about
this the other day but if you have a lot
of like swear words I think in your
videos or like in the titles of your
videos they can pull your monetization
for that so I mean YouTube is great and
and all of that and it's you know super
fun and awesome and you know all that
wonderful stuff but you're at the beck
and call of YouTube as well so so it's
something to keep in mind and you know I
see a lot of advice out there that even
if you do have a YouTube channel to try
to have something else as well whether
it be you know a regular full-time job
or you just do something else on the
side like for me I'm a full-time author
and I can control that a little bit more
from from YouTube how do you keep from
getting copyrighted you can't use
copyrighted music so I mean you you can
you just can't then monetize because
then your video would be copyrighted and
they can either mute the video it
depends on what happens but they can
either mute the video that has the
copyrighted music in it or they can
basically take all of the ad money
that's being made from that video and
give it to the person who owns the
copyright so there's that it's really
frustrating too and it's I don't know
I'm trying to vlog more but I don't
really want to because I don't
understand the copyrighted music and
like if I'm in my car listening to music
as YouTube's gonna thank me because
there's a song on the radio playing and
I'm trying to talk over it and like I
don't really get it and it's not a big
deal to me if I can't monetize all my
videos like that's fine but I also don't
want to have um copyright strikes so
there's that um okay so one person did
ask me I thought this was an interesting
question is um what do you think is a
big misconception about YouTube and
money I thought that was a really good
question I think one of the biggest
misconceptions that I see about YouTube
and money is and this happens in my real
life too and I get really really
frustrated when I say something about
you know oh the paycheck this or this or
that and people are like oh my gosh
that's so easy I can't believe that you
just sit in front of a camera and you
get paid that's so easy I can't believe
you just talk about makeup and then all
these brands send you may get it so easy
and I'm like what like like if you think
this is easy I like I don't know that's
really crazy to me and that really blows
my mind and I get really frustrated
because I also at the same time when
people are like oh you just make a video
and then you get all these things wow
you're so that's so easy and you're so
lucky like I don't know what luck has to
do with this but like I work so so hard
I'm currently filming and uploading
every single day it's not easy it's not
easy to put yourself out there for
criticism it's not easy to wake up every
single day and read comments about
yourself and how you look and you know
how you act and all these things that
pic I get is so hard and so when people
say that what I do is easy it frustrates
me to no end and I am fairly confident
I'm saying this correctly that you can't
actually disclose what you make an
Adsense I'm pretty sure when you sign
your adsense contract it is said that
you can't state what you make but I do
not make a lot of money off youtube even
with the 26 thousand subscribers that I
have I'm not making a lot of money I'm
still if you if you count all the money
I've made through YouTube and all the
money I've spent on my YouTube channel
I've still spent more money than I've
made money so when people say things
like that and it's so easy to make money
on YouTube and you just need to sit down
and make a video that is a huge
misconception that is not true there is
so much work that goes into it there is
so much behind the scenes work that goes
into it
I mean I guess you know like someone
said it looks easy but it's not it's
it's not easy so I just it's so weird to
me because I can't ever imagine saying
something like that to someone about
their job when they're like oh this is
what you know this is what I do for a
job and I come back with oh that sounds
easy like what do you mean no so that I
think that's a really big misconception
is that people for some reason think
this is easy because it's not I love
what I do
and I'm very passionate about it but
it's not easy yes so there's bad okay
thank you Katie she's such a
hard-working youtuber with a consistent
upload schedule katie is my moderator
and she just started her own YouTube
channel and I'm so bummed that I can't
figure out how to put links in this
video because I had your link in there
Katie um but my friend Katie just
started her YouTube channel and she's
moderating this chat so hopefully
everything will go nice and smoothly
today um okay what what editing software
do I use I use um wondershare filmora
for editing what else how do we get real
subscribers McKee yes
you just have to be consistent honestly
like I feel like you just have to be
consistent and you have to put the work
in and I feel like there's another like
weird misconception with you know you're
just gonna start a channel and like have
a viral video and you know all these
subscribers are gonna come it's again
it's a lot of hard work and you have to
thank you too if you ordered my last
book um there's a lot of hard work that
goes into it and I don't think when you
start anything I mean even when you
start some sort of regular job I don't
feel like people go into it and they're
like in two weeks I'm going to be
promoted to manager or whatever so just
remember that with YouTube that it's
definitely what do they say it's a
marathon not a race or something like
that
thank you Joe you have for my book thank
you but it definitely is and I mean so I
would just say you have to keep being
consistent and you have to be yourself
try to put out the best quality videos
that you can a marathon not a sprint and
that's what it is there you go um you
know do the best you can and uh what was
like Messina oh I'm glad that you're
finding this to be helpful advice oh
cool
um but yeah it's definitely that and a
lot of people ask you know should I go
on other people's videos and put like
please subscribe to my channel like
don't do that because that's like um
have I been to the welfare office
begging for more benefits I mean I've
been homeless so there's that um but
yeah I don't go to other people's
channels and say that because it just
makes you look like you only care about
subscribers if you're someone who looks
like you only care about your subscriber
count people are going to see that and
people are going to see that you don't
have a true passion for what it is that
you are doing they people want to see
that you're passionate people want to
see that you're going to put the work
into it and people want to feel a real
connection with you and if you're only
just about wanting or more and more
subscribers I feel like people are
they're gonna be able to see that and so
if you're going to other channels and
you're not even saying anything about
their videos good video you look pretty
today you're just like oh hey why don't
you come over and scribe to my channel
that's really really annoying and also
promoting yourself in other people's
videos I think is not a good thing to do
either there's so many times where I get
comments on my videos and people are
like oh I have a channel too you should
come check it out again you didn't say
anything about my video you didn't say
anything about me did you even watch the
video are you just coming to my channel
to try to promote yourself like that's
not cool either you know and I know that
we weren't subscribers and more
subscribers and I get that but try to
remember that that's not the only goal
with having a youtube channel it should
be about making actual real connections
that's that's what I think that's that's
my view on it that's why I started a
blog in 2009 was so I could connect with
like-minded people like me that's why I
started a YouTube channel too can
with more people not to get a lot of
subscribers not to make a lot of money
not to get PR well a lot like that's not
why you should do anything and honestly
if people are starting a YouTube channel
only because you want products and only
because you want money or you want to be
like YouTube famous I think that people
are gonna see through that and it won't
pay off in the end honestly so there's
that um okay so another question that
came in was how much or do I think it's
realistic to make enough money on
YouTube to be able to quit your job and
that just really depends because it
depends on everybody's situation you
know what I'm saying
I used to be a travel agent I refer back
to this a lot but I used to be a travel
agent and people would come in and say I
want to go here but I don't want to
spend a lot of money or I want to go
here but I wanted to be affordable and
my answer to that was always well what
is affordable to you you know I don't
know what you need to live off of I
don't know what yourselfs does for a
living I don't know if you have a spouse
I don't know if maybe you have a parent
that helps you out like I don't know
your situation we're all so different so
it's hard for me to say like yes I think
you can realistically make enough money
because I don't know your situation and
I don't know what you need every single
month to be able to live you know I'm
saying so that's really hard but do I
think realistically that people can do
YouTube full-time yes because a lot of
people do YouTube full-time so yes but
it just is going to pend on your own
situation if that makes sense so um I
also got asked if I do YouTube full-time
I don't really consider myself full-time
anything to be honest I like whenever
people asked what I do full-time I say
I'm a full-time entrepreneur I'm a
full-time yeah I'm a full-time
dreamchaser is also what I call myself
I'm a published author of five novels
okay I'm a published author of five
novels I do a lot of like editing and
book marketing and things like that and
then I also do the YouTube as well so
that YouTube I also do YouTube as well
so are you Brooke
so I'm sorry if people's Internet's are
still crazy I don't know what would be
wrong then so I'm sorry I don't know
what to do about that on my end what are
my books about they're women's section
mostly focused on like friendships or
romances things like that typically I
have them linked in my YouTube
description boxes but Deborah says try
lowering the video quality I wish I
could figure out how I can even see this
video I don't know how people see
themselves live I'm really frustrated I
thought I'd be able to do that but I
have no you were like I don't even know
where you guys found my video because
now I have no idea how you guys are
doing that but okay so um oh you just
start at the book behind me thank you
this is my latest book this is defining
her thank you thank you is there any
other questions based off of money Oh
some people want me to talk about
influence their sites so I have some
usually I have some LinkedIn like my
regular videos as well and this video
will re upload as like a regular video
also and I'll have a links down there
but a couple of influencer sites that I
use um one is a really good one it's
called octoly and it's not for like
sponsored videos but you can get
products to review in exchange you can
get products for free in exchange for
your reviews and I get a lot of products
that way and they have some really good
items that you can choose and there's
you know of course there's like
stipulations on there like a certain
follower account and things like that
and you do have to review within 21 days
and other things like that but it's
really nice especially if you are newer
to be able to get some products for free
in exchange for your review so that's
really cool
actally is one that I use a lot and then
for sponsored videos I use Fame bit and
then also grapevine those are the two
that I probably use the most to do a
sponsored video and then also ref
luhan's is one that I use and I would
always say to if there's a brand that
you really like you know you could
always reach out to them just yourself
and ask if they would ever want to
partner on a video or ask if they have
other affiliate programs like from my
workouts I used the website cracker I
have for several years and I reached out
to them I reached out to them myself and
said you know I I use your website all
the time like do you have a new sort of
affiliate program and they said yes and
it's the old website called ShareASale
and you just sign up on the ShareASale
and then you know when I refer people to
Crocker if they sign up then I get a
commission off that sale and other other
brands do that too so you can always
just reach out you know if you feel
comfortable you can reach out oh so
Katie says if you can try lowering the
video quality on your end not on my end
yeah try lowering the video quality if
it's still freezing on your end and see
if that helps that was a good tip Katie
Thanks um so that's something that I
would recommend also because I've done
that before too and it actually does
work out pretty well and the most common
one like a really really easy one to
sign up for - is Amazon you can be an
Amazon affiliate I started a book blog
several years ago and the very first
thing I did that I was recommended to do
was to become an Amazon affiliate so
then every time that you put out a link
to Amazon if someone clicks it and make
it makes that purchase not even
something not even for that exact link
but they just purchase anything from
Amazon you would get a commission from
it so that is pretty darn cool someone
so I saw someone who want me to talk
about sponsored videos um
let me know if there's anything in
particular that you want me to talk
about with sponsored videos I've only
done a handful already like yes yes
thanks kitty
oh man candy I'm glad that we've had you
today good caller reminding me to make
you a moderator um if there's any
specific questions you have on sponsor
videos well let me know um but like I
said I've only done a handful of videos
I've done almost all of them through
something like a grapevine or thing bit
where you kind of have that third party
in the middle and it kinda is just a
nice way to be able to protect both of
you really you know you're making sure
that the brain is sending you the
products and everything's on the
up-and-up and then you are being
protected as well making sure that you
know you're getting paid and you know
all that stuff so that's really good um
but then I've done a few you know just
by myself and it can be really hard to
reach out to brands I definitely I get
scared literally every single time that
I message to bring and I still get
afraid like not afraid but like nervous
or something I don't know but you
definitely can yeah you can definitely
can email them yourself and just ask and
instead of proposal I mean the worst
that they can say is no and if they do
you know you can always try again
there's been brands they turn me down
before and then that same brand has then
reached out to me later so know you
never know so Carol says do you have to
mention them at a certain time of the
video most brands most that I've seen to
do a sponsored video they want you to
upfront state within like the first
minute that it's a sponsored video one
thing that makes me really really upset
is when people don't disclose the
response or videos it drives me insane
because they're to me and I know people
have like weird thoughts about sponsored
videos me myself I don't see anything
wrong with them I thought this before I
was a youtuber I don't see anything
wrong with them personally myself but it
bothers me when people don't to school
because I feel like to me that makes it
look like you're doing something shady
if you can't say like oh hey this is a
sponsored video with so-and-so like this
brand thinks I'm so amazing they want to
work with me why would that not be
something that's exciting
I I don't know so I get really upset
when the only place that you can find
it's a sponsored video is down on their
FTC disclaimer that you have to do like
you have to legally disclaim if videos
are sponsored so if you can't say it
upfront that's really ridiculous for me
but most brands do say within the first
minute they want you to you know say hey
it's being sponsored by them so yeah I
don't like that I don't I don't I feel
like that kind of plays into like when
people think like sponsored videos are
shady
it's because people try to hide the fact
of it and you shouldn't that's so crazy
I recently did a sponsored video with
patch ology and I nearly lost my ish I
was so excited I love patch ologies like
I wanted to yell to everybody like patch
ology likes me to who like what is it
that's so exciting
so I just think it's weird when people
turn to like hide that fact but yes you
do someone mentioned it is the law you
do have to disclaim sponsor videos so um
yeah they typically want you to say it
in the first you know minute or so a lot
of brands typically want your sponsored
videos to be only on their products I
think I think I'm seeing more brands
move away from that which makes me
really excited like the pathology video
that I did it was just my skincare
favorites in general and I just reviewed
my pathology products first per our
agreement
I reviewed the pathology products first
but then I talked about all my other
skincare favorites and hopefully more
brands do that because I think I think
it's better content
honestly like unless you're doing
something like you know a full face
using that brand and you're only using
you know that brand's makeup you know I
get it but something like skincare
favorites like you know when I was
talking to patch ology I was like
skincare favorites has been such a
highly requested video like would you
want to partner on that because I don't
think I just want to do I mean probably
for pathology I could have but I just
thought it would be better to put it in
a full video and so some brands will
still want you to
only be all about their brand and their
products and things like that but some
of them I'm seeing more and more brands
being more okay with you know a
favorites video or even like a get ready
with me or some sort of makeup tutorial
using their products and I think that's
really cool because I think more people
gravitate towards that on this lease
though Anna says do have any tips on
when it's best to upload a video my
advice on that is always to take a
little bit of time for yourself okay
shoot I miss that question um sorry what
I say with with uploading a video is
take a little bit of time and try to
upload at different times throughout the
day and see what works best for you so
that's what I did I took probably almost
a full month and I just played around
with different days that I was posting
and different times that I was posting
and I saw what worked best for me what
works best for me is posting in the
mornings that's when I noticed the most
amount of my subscribers were being able
to come over so people they're better at
night some people are better in the
afternoons so I would say just take a
little bit of time and you know figure
out what it is that your subscribers are
you know when they're able to most come
over to your video like I took notes I
like I made little notes like at this
time this many people came in the first
hour this many people came in 24 hours
and that's how I decided that mornings
were better for me to upload my videos
so that is my advice there um we're at
31 minutes so I'm gonna try to start
winding down pretty soon but if anybody
has any other questions let me know um
Margaret's those mornings are good yeah
I feel like mornings are good for a lot
of people but you know some people are
they only want to post at night
Oh Ashley theory hey girl see you have
volleyball that movie as hot as last
week thankfully um but yeah if there's
any other questions let me know I think
if there was anything I didn't touch on
how do you deal with opposing brands
that don't like each other for your
YouTube videos how do you deal with
opposing brands that don't like each
other I don't know
I don't know if I've ever had to deal
with something like that I guess um
what's a good starter camera for a
YouTube channel I started off my phone
just an Android and then I moved to the
sony a 5100 which is what I have now
Michelle says she was wondering about
networks and why some youtubers have
them and some don't do you mean like
actually YouTube networks I don't have a
network myself um from what I can tell I
don't know from what I can tell you can
join networks on YouTube and basically
they're supposed to help you grow your
channel and your following and almost be
like I'm almost like I'm manager the
Cubs are winning but I got thrown out oh
man I got muted in the other room but
they can almost be like your youtube
like manager but they take a portion of
your commission and to me I just never
really I didn't really get that like I
feel like I can work pretty hard anyways
um I feel like I can work hard and you
know look over my own analytics and such
I don't need someone else helping me at
this time I don't feel like I need
someone helping me and I feel like when
you're a smaller youtuber and you're
only making a very small amount of money
for then have to someone to take a part
of that it's like oh man like that sucks
so no I don't want to join a network I
see a lot of people saying like no they
don't want to join networks I've had bad
experiences with networks like they
don't really do anything they only cater
to the big youtubers and then just take
you know pennies from us and smaller
youtubers um so I don't know I wouldn't
suggest the network but that's just me I
know some bigger youtubers also have
managers like sound like I think
Jacqueline Hills mom is her manager and
I think like what's her name Nicole can
see Leo I think her boyfriend
it's her manager and things like that I
don't need a manager at this time in my
life so maybe if I'm real big and stuff
you know even have a manager but I
definitely
don't need one at this time um okay Oh
Christina thanks girl I'm except for
tomorrow's Villa by two
