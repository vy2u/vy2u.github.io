I'm gonna do a get ready with me today
huh and I am not awake yet okay I always
feel like I'm Way too close to the
camera okay hi hi hello everybody
uh yeah this is kind of like an
impromptu hi Zoey hi Emma kind of an
impromptu live I primed my eyes so I
probably look a little bit strange hi
Melissa hi Carol hi from Argentina hello
whoa oh gosh I just ate our name enough
of anything in my teeth um I'm doing
okay uh a little impromptu live normally
I go live on Tuesdays but if you don't
follow me on other social media accounts
my laptop took a doozy on Thursday it
just completely died I guess like the
hard drive crashed or something the hard
drive died I don't know what happened
and that was really stressful but my
friend Matt was able to fix it but I
didn't have a laptop Thursday or Friday
so um he just got it to me we just got
it back last night at like I don't know
seven maybe step six seven o'clock or
something like that so beauty I'm a
hairy Alex um yes can you send your
laptop out for Matt yeah I know like I
don't know how he did it
oh it says I have a bad connection yeah
um
but yeah so I didn't have a laptop and
so I couldn't like edit any videos or
anything like that so I didn't have a
video ready for today I'm from Iowa I'm
from Iowa um so I didn't have a video
ready for today so I was like I don't
know I'll just do a live and usually on
Saturdays I do like a makeup tutorial
get ready with me up makeup challenge
you know something like that so I
thought well we could just get ready
together and hang out or I don't know
like who's all around on Saturdays so I
just thought it could be kind of like a
little casual so
also we're gonna do today I'm just gonna
get ready again um and then we can just
like talk and hang out so a lot of
people were requesting like casual
chitchat conversations on my life so
that's what today's gonna be that's what
we're gonna do so just let me know what
you guys want to talk about so I gotta
grab my mirror though wait right yeah I
gotta grab my mirror um let me know if
you guys can see me okay it's pretty
dark
there's no sunshine outside but I have
my ring light ready to go any luck
convincing my husband to come on camera
not really he's been in a couple of my
blogs you can see him in my blog so I'll
have another vlog that's what I wanted
to post a vlog yesterday but I wasn't
able to edit it on my laptop died so I
still have a vlog coming and he'll he'll
be in there hopefully my connection is
okay I don't know why I said I had a bad
connection so okay Donna I'm glad I can
come by I'm like in such a weird mood -
I've been getting headaches all week I
don't know what's going on cuz I don't
normally get headaches and so I'm just
like dealing with it look like I did I
put areas of the thumbnail I kept trying
to take a thumbnail picture and I just
thought it was not working out funny I'm
like I'm just taking a picture of my dog
I'll try to get her in here
um she's so big though she's 60 pounds
she's 60 pounds so she's hard to lift
I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do my eyes
with the Jaclyn hill palette I'm gonna
do that first
I used the Monica Monica Darr step one
prime I don't know if this is an eye
primer for sure but that's what I used
as an eye primer so I don't know that's
what I use this eye primer I used two
yesterday and I really liked it it came
in my lip monthly bag so I'm going to
use the Jaclyn palette and we're just
gonna grab out one of these morphe
brushes my husband just got home so you
might hear some commotion going on my
poor palette like this is dirty dirty
like a palette Oh
Hey oh thanks my caddy Thanks
back to school look that's a good idea
okay I'm gonna shut my office door
actually okay
BRB okay okay I just shut my eyes shut
my office door even though I'll probably
make areas really mad I'm probably just
gonna do something kind of simple today
cuz I don't feel very well so I'm gonna
go in with this one Stephanie doesn't
very pixelated I don't know why I don't
know oh um one person did mention if
like you have a bad connection or if
it's really pixelated to try on your end
to lower the I don't even know what you
call it um the resolution I don't know
what I'm trying to say so like instead
of watching in like 1080p if you try to
lower it a little bit it might make it
better for you so you could maybe try
that so I'm just gonna put this into the
crease so okay Tracy says lowering the
quality of the video helped me out a lot
so there you go Aries okay well Aries
areas um knows how to like bust through
doors now apparently so that's her new
thing so she just opened up my office
door Aries is she will be four in
September for at the end of September
which is crazy and we got her um I'm
gonna get her right before Thanksgiving
so yeah oh just got done reading my
latest book thank you yeah thank you so
much that's awesome I probably should
have at least like planned out what the
heck I was gonna do with my eyes look
right probably something just a little
bit simple I we have no plans for today
we might take Aries unlike a little
stroll a little bit later or something
but we have like no set in stone plans
so probably just something a little bit
casual especially because I don't feel
the very about
I hate not feeling well um have I tried
the Cody airspun powder no no I haven't
where do you get that at um where do you
get that putter XO I know everybody
talks about it Oh someone to find a big
bug in their house
well Hummer and Walgreens oh okay I
don't go to Walmart a lot oh I'm gonna
try to close my door again even though
I'm sure she'll just bust right through
it but hello thanks you know I wasn't I
was stressing so much because you know
I'm posting a video every single day and
I was like stressing that I was gonna
have to miss some days because of the
whole laptop issue and then I was like
duh I can just go live like that's fine
even if you know I know on the weekends
people are probably busy or something
like even if you know not as many people
can come by at least it you know
reuploads as a regular video people can
still watch it if they even want to
watch you know I know some people don't
like to watch your lives on the replay
um yeah I thought I could still have
that Walmart is all you have in your
small town love from hungry that's so
cool Aries is a Hungarian viola do I
have thoughts on the subculture palettes
I do I have a lot of thoughts on it
actually um I'm gonna film a review I
hope to film it either tomorrow or
Monday but it'll be up next week for
sure
I've been taking the past couple days
just to play with it and do different
looks with it but I mean I'll say I
don't think it's worth all the drama
that's going around I think people are
just kind of I think people realized
this is gonna sound really rude but you
know whatever I don't know
I just I feel like people think it's
cool to like bash something and people
are just like jumping on that bandwagon
which is really it was pretty silly to
me to be honest but I still have a lot
of thoughts on it that I'll try to
explain in a video when I have them all
put together but
I don't think it's worth all this
craziness that's happening I'm gonna go
in with this shade I don't know why I
don't know why I'm gonna pick that one
um where's
the Kylie collection yeah I put that in
my latest well I buy up video and I I'm
not interested I'm not really interested
in Kylie cosmetics to be honest is
anybody gonna watch her show what's it
called kind of like life of Kylie I was
gonna say Kylie's life or life of Kylie
it's definitely one of them I'm pretty
sure what does anybody gonna watch her
show I don't know if I will I don't
really watch TV I don't really watch TV
very much so I don't know if I'll watch
it for sure but is the jaclyn hill
palette worth it yeah yeah I love this
palette became I love like I love this
palette so good a lot of people are not
watching the show huh that's funny they
say she's trying too hard to make her
look relatable I kind of wondered that
as well I kind of wondered I saw
something like I saw how Diana people
are like oh she was crying because like
she didn't go to prom like she was
crying cause she was so upset that she
didn't go to prom I was like okay like I
mean I've been to prom so maybe I can't
even be like that mad cuz it's like a
life experience but I'm pretty sure
Kylie's had a whole lot of other life
experiences that I would trade in for my
mom like my prom wasn't that much fun
you know what I'm saying but I don't
know I don't know man
hello every New Yorkers is gone um well
yeah I'm just I'm just not very I'm just
not very interested in Kylie cosmetics
right now and I saw like don't they
launch it on Tuesday and then they'd
like a restocked again on Friday and I'm
like ah like stab doing that because I
that's what happened with my Kim
kardashian-west they put it out I think
it was on a Tuesday and then before
anything even shipped they restocked it
again I'm like how is that even possible
you're doing that it's just weird to me
how is book six coming on slower than I
was hoping since I started uploading
everyday books because it was not coming
along as fast as I thought it was going
to UM book six is also the first book in
a series and it's the first time that
I'm writing a series like some of my
other books kind of linked to each other
like my first and my second book like my
second book revisits I think anything
hey kitty
um Oh Kristina oh my gosh i guy that's
funny um so it's the first time I'm
writing a series like book to kind of
revisit it a few Book One characters and
then in up to I do you kind of got a
follow-up to the previous both a
questionable friendship you kind of got
caught up on some of those characters
storylines but just real like you don't
need to read a question or end trip to
read up - I do but this is actually
going to be a series where you do you
would want to read all of the books so
what I'm finding there is that you know
I'm writing about the main character but
at the same time I'm also basically
building the book for the second book so
not only are you getting her story but
you're also getting a lot of book - the
main character in that book you're
getting a lot of her story - to get you
ready for a book - and it's kind of hard
and then book two scenes will come into
my head so I write those because I want
those for when I start writing the next
book in the series is it's a lot more
challenging than I thought
gonna be to write a series that's for
sure
and it's kind of what's taking me slower
but at the same time I hope that means
the next book in the series will go a
little bit faster because I already have
so many scenes written for book two so I
don't know we'll see that's my hope
anyways so what do I think about Katy
and desi collab I'm so excited
like when I love them like I love them
so much I actually started watching Katy
first I started watching Katy like so
long ago so long ago um I think before I
don't think she always lived in the LA
area doesn't even know if I'm saying
that correctly but because I thought I
started watching her before she moved
and I got involved with epsy and stuff
and what brushes am i using um they're
brushes from the morphe copper dreams
brush set I love this is back in stock I
just talked about it
in the makeup that I travel with and um
I didn't think it was in stock but it is
I say get it it comes with that case to
the gold case that I took with me out of
town so I blending brushes are so so
good for real I'm doing like the most
basic I like I could ever do so um yeah
I started watching you Pahadi candle
just to be able to read my books oh my
gosh that's so cool thank you um but
yeah I started watching Katie first so
long ago and I just I I really liked her
because I felt like she wasn't doing the
same thing as everybody else since I
have a bad connection again um but she
wasn't doing the same thing as everybody
else like she was using different makeup
and different brushes and different
techniques and talking about different
things you know what I'm saying and I
was I was really really liking that
um Stephanie a lesser lux Katie from
Leicester Lux we're talking about the
Katy desi
collab so I just always really liked her
and it's been a lot of fun to watch her
grow and her success it's been super
cool when I remember at one point like I
was gonna watch desi and I felt like I
couldn't like I felt like she was to I
don't know like we just weren't clicking
in the beginning we
like we just I was I don't know man and
then I finally started following her on
snapchat because I would always see her
on Katy snapchat that I finally went to
UM or I finally added desi on snapchat
and that's when I was like I felt like
you really sometimes it's so hard with
YouTube videos to get to know someone
for real because I feel like a lot with
YouTube you feel like you have to be you
know this certain person or a
professional person or things like that
and then where is on your snapchat you
know it's more casual and it's more
laid-back and so once I added desi on
snapchat
I was really like oh my gosh I love this
chick she's up boom so now I really like
her but it's funny cuz it wasn't for
Katy I don't know if I would follow up
it does need to be completely honest do
I not have another I brush that I pulled
out no what is he is this one and hope
for the best and like such a space cadet
today guys can you tell I don't feel
good
his man headaches are just the weirdest
I don't know like I'd rather have like a
sore throat or something um oh good I
love reading the comments it's so fun to
read okay um I think I just want to do
all Matt in my eyes to be honest because
that's like my comfort zone
have I ever considered adding writing
and reading content back back into my
channel what I'm going to do how I do my
makeup monthlies where I talk about like
Oh Nikki thank you Oh super chat thank
you so much I really appreciate that how
many hours a week do you designate to
each area of your life I don't know
because I feel like that's sometimes
hard to say because that's a really
common question I get asked just you
know how do i allocate my time but
honestly it's hard for me to answer
because I'm such a multitasker that I
always have like 20 different things
going on at one time so
yeah I mean honestly I know I'm just
doing Elvis so it's so weird oh my gosh
Vanessa thank you some project beauty
list oh yeah you guys are funny um so
yeah I'm just I'm multitasking a lot so
there's that but as of right now I'm
definitely putting a lot into my YouTube
channel like I'm putting a lot into it
and just really kind of going all out
for it trying to anyways my book blog
has definitely any button not giving as
much love for me I still read I mean if
you guys follow me on snap Mike indle my
Kindle is I was always there oh thank
you what is super job Super Shot is
basically donating money to me in my
channel I would get it if you make a
monetary donation then I get it in like
my youtube check type of thing so so
thank you guys thank you to everyone who
is donating because that's pretty
amazing like that's so amazing
um no a strep I know I get strep all the
time like I can diagnose myself with
drove that's how often I get strep
throat it's so annoying um my season I
didn't ask anyone to pay me people do
that willingly for themselves okay um
but my blog has definitely been on the
back burner I know okay um my boss
definitely been on the back burner and
I'd love to know if anybody else blogs
and that Katie I know or I think you're
here too Katie
Arum what do you think about your um
your blog because I know Katie is my my
moderator and Katie's my moderator and I
know that she has a blog and I feel like
Katie I feel like you do so well with
your blog and I feel like mine is just
going on the back burner like I feel
like people like
you know I feel like they like the
videos and they like you know just being
the more interactive social media and
like I've read a lot of things we're
saying like blogs are dead like blogging
it was like dying and all that stuff
which makes me really sad because that's
how I started everything that's how I
started with my book blog so it makes me
sad when I hear things like that but at
the same time my blog is like it's like
I used to post something on my blog
every single day if not two times a day
type of thing and now I just barely post
it all so I don't know I don't know but
I still write I mean I write every day
thank you pings my I mean yeah I still
write every day or I plot every day or I
do some kind of marketing for my books
every day because that's something that
you know I still definitely consider my
career um oh yeah oh I was talking with
Katie I was talking about blogging um
because we were talking about like kind
of what I spend a lot of my time in and
I said that my blog is kind of like way
on the backburner and I know that you
have a really good blog and I just
wondered what you thought about it like
when people say that like blogging is
dying and you know more people are doing
like the youtubes and things like that
like I was just wondering your thoughts
on that or what anyone thinks about that
- I need a think I'm gonna go in with
this one next just just the fun of it
we're at 20 minutes which is crazy
because I all I have is two eye shadows
on my eyes so this is going this this is
going very well but I'm usually around
this time YouTube likes that kicked me
out so if I get kicked out just I should
come back it always lets me resume the
chat so just so you guys know usually
right around this time is when when
YouTube is like girl you're talking too
much put some makeup on your face I'm
just gonna blend this one all over my
eye drill our love out of it um but yeah
so definitely YouTube and my writing is
kind of where like my main focus is
right now so
that's what I would say my Instagram I
mean I still post on my Instagram too I
typically still post two or three times
a day unless I'm like out of town or
something but I don't know I just
Instagram I'm just like not very into it
lately that's I feel like I'm just I'm
always so tired of all these like crazy
like clickbait looking photos like I
feel like if you don't have a clickbait
thumbnail that like you're not gonna get
views on Instagram and it's just making
me not want to like even be over there
because I keep clicking on a video and
then it's something completely different
and I'm like oh like I get it I get it
like I kind of get it as a creator and
someone who like yes of course I want
views and subscribers and etc but at the
same time I'm also like I watch and I
get so frustrated when I think I'm
watching something and it's something
completely different
it's just weird so I feel like I've been
kind of funky with Instagram lately
because I'm just I'm just like not
feeling the vibe over there so I don't
know I'm still posting but just I'm not
as into it as I once was and it's so
hard with Instagram I get so frustrated
because every time I am like responding
to comments I'll respond to like five
comments and then Instagram is like you
are doing suspicious behavior and you
have been blocked from commenting I'm
like because I'm responding to my own
comments on my own page like what like
Instagram is so ridiculous I'm like okay
so then I feel bad because I never
respond to people's comments like every
once in a while I tried to respond but
I'm so afraid that Instagram is gonna
have freaking locked me out of my
account or something so then I don't
respond to people and then I feel bad
that I'm not responding to comments and
like Instagram I get it together I don't
know it's just weird so that's why I
always want to like apologize for not
like commenting back and responding to
people's comments and such but it's
because then I get banned
Thank You Love thank you
um negativity is such oh shoot it's why
did it feed negativity is such a huge
thing right now if there's anything you
could change with this platform what
would it be um that's a good question I
mean definitely I saw Jaclyn hill post
something the other day about how like
the the comments section in YouTube
videos is like the most negative space
ever and I would agree it is it's super
negative and it's it's really sad to me
I was dealing with a cyber bullying
actually last week yeah last week with
some cyber bullying and I mean I'm dealt
with cyber bullying since I started a
book blog in 2009 it's always been
around it's always been here but
definitely I would love to do something
to address cyber bullying more and maybe
not even how to stop it because how do
you stop it like how I know I don't know
how you do that but even even just
trying to help the people that are going
through it I think would be a really big
deal I think um cuz it's so hard it's
hard to have to you know read those
things and then you have people who are
like and then you just have other people
that have other opinions about people
that do YouTube and the expectations and
I talked about this in one of my live
videos too but someone asked me if
there's any misconceptions with YouTube
and I said that people think it's really
easy people think this is super simple
you just jump on camera and all of a
sudden you get money and you get all
these products into you and you get all
this stuff it's so much harder it's so
much work that you're putting in and
then at the same time you do have to did
I see Jacqueline's new house yeah yeah
yeah yeah I did um but then at the same
time you have to read all these things
about you and it's so hard and it really
challenges you mentally and so um yeah I
definitely think that's a big
misconception and that's something that
I would really like to help I
I feel like we should see more I feel
like we should see more of trying to
help with the cyber bullying issue it is
so so extreme and it's only getting
worse and worse and worse I mean we even
we've already had it today miss
live-chat I've been lecturing for 26
minutes so you know it's crazy but
that's definitely something I would love
to see love to see change it's so easy
to sit behind a screen and you know
anonymously taunts them wanna try to put
someone down or things like that and
it's really scary man because I mean I'm
pretty open with this but I I deal with
depression I have my whole life and your
you know since I was a very young girl
and when someone is bullying you like
you don't know what someone's going
through at that time of their life like
that could have a huge impact on them in
the worst way like I just think people
have to be so much more careful with
their words because you don't know what
you're saying and who you're saying it
to and how they're feeling you know so
sorry I didn't mean to get so deep on
you guys but actually it's a really big
deal um did I even show you
I used the Beca first light primer um as
a primer I really like it I tried it my
sample challenge and I really did like
it I'm gonna use the Lancome and my
blurry my Lancome it's hence a dole hose
OE o is OE I get a girl um I'm gonna use
this foundation and then my Sigma 3d HD
max kabuki I'm so I love this brush so
much I just got this foundation from
octa Lee and I've really been loving it
roll it roll it loving it so yeah I mean
man I have never left a negative comment
and not trying to be like I've never
done this but I have never left a
negative comment on someone's video I
have never some down anybody's video I
never would never because even if it's
someone I don't like even those videos
oh man I used to watch this Qi and all
that I think every single thumbnail they
did was just clickbait and then I would
get so frustrated I still never would
thumbs down their videos ever because it
so much time and energy and effort just
to make a video you know I would never
try to take that away from someone but I
would never just I I just could not I
just can't imagine doing that and you
know maybe it's because I can understand
and I've been in these shoes and etc etc
but at the same time I also have this
kind of thing it's common sense like man
oh okay
what does the what does the thumbs-down
do you know I've always wondered why
YouTube still has that like for you know
a society that talks you know very you
know I feel like cyberbullying is a big
issue that people talk about bullying in
general you know violence bla bla bla
like why do we stop at the thumbs down
option on YouTube it's crazy to me I
don't get it um and I mean I don't feel
like I don't feel like it does anything
like I've heard that if your video gets
a lot of likes it could um help boost
the video type of thing like with the
algorithm I don't really know but to be
honest I think the thumbs down I think
it just just makes the grater feel bad
you know hey that's what I think if
anybody else has any good ideas but it's
just weird to me so okay um Foundation
is done if there's enough thumbs on they
could remove the video from YouTube
really well that's crazy
I don't know that I should not know that
yeah Joe I agree with you um I'm gonna
try I tried this concealer yesterday and
I really liked it this is a new one from
heaven upon hello Margaret
this is from Kevin Daquan the ethereal
the realist supernatural concealer this
is what the packaging looks like do i
rewatch my old videos sometimes I do
like when people leave a comment someone
was so funny they left a comment on one
of my very if it wasn't my first video
is one of my very first
someone left a comment and said uh oh
man um they said your office got
overtaken by makeup and it's so funny
because when I first filmed like some of
my first videos you just basically see
like wall-to-wall like I filmed off my
phone which was I'm filming this off of
now and it's just a huge base I'm like
oh yeah that's interesting but you can
see so much of my office and someone
picked your office has been overtaken by
makeup I'm like it has it really really
has oh here's what the concealer looks
like this is in the shade light are used
to yesterday and I thought it was pretty
good so I'm gonna try it again today and
see what I think about it but yeah
sometimes I I go back and watch but it's
so funny because you can tell that I
mean in the first couple videos you can
tell I'm like nervous and scared like my
voice is high I swear I swear my voice
is like high then oh it's so funny oh
I'm gonna use my Sephora 57 brush to
blend that out oh gosh I started talking
about something and I didn't even finish
it so someone asked if I was going to be
talking about reading or writing more in
my videos so my idea that I had is when
I do the makeup monthly that I talk
about my favorite products and like a
failed products yeah I love this brush
so much this is like it's like my
favorite brush so I talk about my
favorites my fails I talk about products
that were like just okay like I I
couldn't make him a favorite but they
were still pretty good type of thing and
I thought for favorites that I could
also mention my favorite books because I
am a book blogger that's what my blog
chiclet plus is for and so I read a lot
I mean I read I mean I probably read a
book every two days two to three days is
what I like my reading schedule and then
I review the books on my blog
and so I thought any books that I give a
five-star rating to which is the highest
rating like on Amazon so I thought I
could mention those in my favorites just
to kind of be a way to introduce books
so like mr. Wright's wife that was such
a good book I love that book mr. right
swipe by Ricky Schultz yeah that book
was so good I loved it I loved finding
books where I don't relate to the main
characters like at all where I don't
relate to them at all and I can still
get along with the book so well because
sometimes you hear people say like in
the book blogging community like oh I
couldn't relate to that character we had
nothing in common and that's totally
true but like I can still read books
about people being on dating apps and
you know trying to find love that way
and I can read books about moms and you
know they're challenging or they're like
parental challenges and things like that
I think those are super fun to read and
it just to me is like a testament to the
writing you know how good the the writer
is and creating the story in the setting
and all that I'm gonna set that with my
Rimmel stay matte so yeah that's um I
mean I'm seeing a couple comments you
guys seem to like that idea so I think
that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna add
in a couple of my five-star books to my
Monthly's you know I'm just finding
we're just finding more ways to make
those videos longer but you know all of
you who read the fighting her our
YouTube Nelly or team fruit I would love
to know who you guys are because
defining her was such a challenging book
to write it was so different from what I
originally planned like that story had
was doing nothing of the sorts when I
started writing it I had those
characters completely different a
completely different ending I mean I
still to this day can't figure out what
happened in that book I just start
writing broke your team Nellie I just
started writing and when I start writing
it's too the best way I can explain it
is that I just black out
and the characters they just do their
own thing and sometimes something
happens I something and I read it back
and I'm like who why did they do that
that's a terrible idea
but they did it so I just gotta let
their story play out like they tell the
story through me and I just I just type
it out so that book took way way many
different turns than I thought I was
going to but but it was a lot of fun to
write it was super it was super
interesting so to see it all come
together but it was hard for me because
I don't know if I feel like either
character is really all that likable and
I was really worried about it um it was
one of my questions I asked to my beta
readers who a beta reader is someone who
reads it prior to it publishing to give
feedback like this plotline doesn't make
sense this character when she did that
it doesn't make sense they can give me
early feedback and I was like are either
character is as either of the characters
likable like are people going to like
this book if they can't relate to the
characters because they make so many bad
decisions like I'm going to use it the
Kaepernick on um
sculpting this is called the sculpting
contour book I loved his sculpting
powder love the sculpting powder and my
Sigma f30 two runs and contour but yeah
I really wondered um I really wondered
if people who would be able to release
that book at all but what a lot of
people said was that the book was just
very real that way because no one's I
mean the last thing that you want to do
is read about a perfect person because
who is perfect like you know that's not
relatable at all but when you have two
characters and they're both making such
you know questionable decisions I was
kind of worried I kind of thought do I
need it do I need to make one of them
nicer do I need to make one of them more
relatable or something but a lot of
people thought that it was a very
relatable book which was awesome so oh
you oh wow
oh yeah yeah um Mario was saying that
she bought a copy and I shipped it to
Finland
yeah I'll ship anywhere and it's so
exciting because it actually makes it
Finland Romania Italy I always you know
whenever you ship and you ship
international it's kind of like Oh hold
your breath and Thank You Margaret
Oh Thank You Margaret what summer goals
do you have left to accomplish oh man I
got a lot of summer goals left to
accomplish um I feel like I have so much
from my summer makeup bucket list that I
haven't done yet I still want to do one
of those face charts I still have not
done one of those what else do I have on
there I need to go back and revisit that
video I know I need to do like a beauty
lish order we still have quite a bit I
think on our summer bucket list even
though we got a lot done last weekend
but like my summer bucket list with my
friends what do we have to do eat
somewhere here in Des Moines what else
do we have to do
oh we're throwing a party at the end of
summer we're having uh I don't know if I
can say the theme yet but we're having a
theme party at the end of summer we have
to float the river a face chart live
that would be so hard like that
I don't I don't know man I feel like I
would get really frustrated because I'm
not very um like artistically creative
so I feel like I will get really
frustrated doing a face chart because I
feel like it's just not gonna come
naturally to me at all so I'm really
scared to do that one okay I feel like
I'm looking very pale so hopefully
hopefully this makes me look like I have
some more color
okay okay that's what we do for now um
how is volleyball it's going well it's
going well we only have next week is our
last week and then after that is like
the tournament and we'll see how the
tournament goes it kind of sucks though
because you don't even win anything in
the tournament like lots of barn not
even like a candy bar got ice cream :
I went home it's kind of a bummer I'm
I'm gonna use the number-7 blush looks
like this and it is in the shade peach
velvet and my Sigma f40
but yeah well it's been well um glad
glad that I did it we did mud volleyball
last weekend and hopefully if I can get
the vlog up for this week
you guys can see it because our friend
Matt Matt who won my attain this the
prize um
Matt's mom a lot like I was I've logged
but she recorded a lap for us and she
did such a good job that's mom I want to
like hire her because there was one
night so we all stayed at his mom's
house and there was a bunch of us just
standing around the kitchen talking and
she just sat there and recorded things
and she took photos I'm like I need
someone like you in my life just that's
so cool cuz we got so much good stuff
hopefully I think if I can put it
together we would have gotten so much
good stuff for the vlog because she was
always right there like if she came and
watched us do the 5k and she came and
she stayed the whole time and my
volleyball and like recorded us and she
was so awesome so hopefully I can put
together a good good vlog but mud
volleyball was super challenging but we
ended up getting fourth place in the
tournament which was crazy we were one
away from actually like making money
back which would have been super cool
but you thought that wasn't really hard
that was my first time has anybody done
mud volleyball because that was super
super hard but it was a lot of fun I
should have a full face using only one
product
how how do people do that I don't even I
don't even know how I would how I would
go about that I still just look like I
don't feel good can you guys see it in
my eyes you see it that I don't feel
good it's bugging me man
mmm I don't want to not feel good okay
I'm going to run my own adieu next I'm
just an eyeliner maybe that's why I
don't think I look well I need eyeliner
I love eyeliner this is the pier on
point eyeliner and down to earth it's a
brown um I think I'm gonna take my ears
off too cuz I think I'm pretty much done
done with the ears and they kind of hurt
I can't heard the back of my head okay
so now we're approaching 41 minutes so
sorry this is super long of course it is
of course it is but I'm just I'm shocked
that YouTube hasn't kicked me out yet
usually it kicks me out at 20 minutes
and 40 minutes so if it kicks me out I
shouldn't be able to come right back in
so he's gonna do some eyeliner but yeah
we actually were already planning on
doing the mud volleyball next year we
did it in we did it with the Dubuque
honey Fair I used to live in Dubuque I'm
like my brother lives there Matt's from
Easter Buick so we went back there for
the fair cuz a 5k and my volleyball or
both on our summer bucket list so we got
them both done that weekend but we're
already talking about going back next
year the only thing that kind of freaked
me out was that the smell of manure was
very strong and you know it's at the
fair the fairgrounds there's animals
walking around but then you literally
seven this pile of mud and it just
smells like my new and you're like what
am i standing in what's happening here
was my favorite movie or TV show
Margaret asked I don't watch a lot of TV
I just I'm also just watching YouTube we
actually just finally bumped down our we
have DirecTV we bumped down our channel
selection today this morning because
there's both my husband and I are both
like slowly not watching a lot of TV but
I do love sports I'm a big Chicago Cubs
fan
Big Green Bay Fan dream a Packers so we
do love our sports around here but other
than that like sometimes at night if I
just need something to help me like zone
out well I try to fall asleep I'll watch
like enews but I'm gonna be more mud my
skin was very softer the next day like
oh man like my face smell or maybe
smelled good
I'm face felt super soft I was like well
everyday but we did get really funky tan
lines from being covered covered in mud
but any spots where there wasn't mud we
would get super tan so like our backs
and our shoulders are super blotchy
which is kind of hilarious but but yeah
I don't know other than that I don't
really watch TV my favorite movie I
think I'm gonna have to be clueless
anybody else a clueless fan because that
movies still I think I could still
recite every line of clueless did I use
the wrong foundation I feel like my
foundation looks really light no I use
their it would oh well yes clueless yes
I would mean um clueless and then
probably Legally Blonde after that but
it's so funny I can't remember the year
that clueless came out but uh I'm what I
was not very old and I remember watching
it when I got a little bit older and
like socially really inappropriate parts
in that movie and as a young girl I was
just saying I'm like whatever man
but yeah that's kind of an inappropriate
movie some parts not all parts but did
anybody else want Cher's closet that's
always like my life goal when I was
young I know a lot of people watch Game
of Thrones um cuz did that just start
didn't that just start back up again and
everybody's been talking about it on the
Internet but no I've never seen that
although my friends watch it too but
I've never seen it and um my husband
watches Walking Dead I don't I can't
mm-hmm I will have so many nightmares I
can't do that I can't he can't even so
my office is on our first floor and then
are like living room is right over here
I can't even watch it over there I can't
hear the noises you can't hear the
noises he's gotta watch it in the
bedroom
I can't handle it I can't handle it I
know so many people will help the
walking dead you know what oh shoot
you know what I did want to watch was um
I know Alex this yeah I know that you
like the walking dead I know I can't
just get a movies nope I will cry I'll
have nightmares like I'm the person
after like if I do have to watch a scary
movie someone has to come to the
bathroom with me
I'm freaking 30 I'm 30 and someone will
have to come the bathroom with me
because I I swear
someone's gonna jump out at me I swear
someone has to come the bathroom with me
it's so embarrassing that's probably the
main reason why I don't watch him
because I don't want to be embarrassed
having to ask someone to go the bathroom
with me you know yeah I hate the noises
like the clock it's like no oh I heard a
lot of people talk about Empire - yeah
Breaking Bad nope my husband watched
that one he really liked that one right
yeah he really liked that one I know I
just we tried to watch new girl together
we hunt Netflix like last year or
something and we tried to watch new girl
and it's it's it's really really hard to
be self-employed because my mindset is
if I'm not working I'm not making money
even though a lot of it is residual like
even though I'm not working right now
but maybe someone is buying my book
somewhere someone who's watching a
YouTube video or you know that sort of
thing but it's just still the mindset of
I always have to be working and so I
would try it like I would go out and
watch an episode I'm like okay I'm gonna
run back in my office real quick just
answer a few emails I'll be right back
out and then five episodes later I come
out and he's like yeah I didn't I didn't
look for you I'm like my bed and then I
just finally kind of gave up
I'll come out sometimes when he's still
watching it and I'm like wait a second
which is like what is happening how did
this person get to over that root and
he's like I'm not even I'm not even
telling me how so yeah I'm not the best
to watch TV show so oh I did watch
Gilmore Girls did anybody watch come on
girls cuz I watched the new episodes
that they just did I don't know if I got
it like huh I didn't really understand
most of those episodes like there was
all these like singing and dancing
things happening and I'm like just get
on with the story
how.what yeah so what did you think yeah
so you guys didn't like the new episode
I was totally confused
I was lost I was I was lost watching the
new episodes I just I didn't get it and
I didn't appreciate the cliffhanger at
all not at all so yeah that was nice and
confusing but I don't know um what else
what if you guys watch your bones I
don't even know what that is what's
bones I don't know what that is oh man
like everybody imagine bones
um someone asked me why I wanted to
become an author I've always been a
really big reader um should I do my
brows next I bought the brow Wiz
Nastasia brow is I can try it it takes
me really long to do my brows so I know
Pretty Little Liars I know everybody
watched that too not me
I'm so cool I never have any idea what's
going on like people get in
conversations about the really cool
shows and I'm over here like I won't you
do I can tell you about a makeup
tutorial that's all I got
bones is sort of like NCIS okay I did
watch Grey's Anatomy a little bit in
college
Oh Sex in the City I just watched Sex in
the City in college two more to life
than TV that's true man TVs just I don't
know it's it's really hard like I
mentioned I like to multitask so it's
hard for me to sit down like a lot of
times if I watch
TV it's like I'm working out or
something you know I don't know I just
don't have time to sit down I never do
my brows on camera so this is gonna be
super hard you're a huge Jets fan but
yet someone else I want to be an author
I've always been a big reader my mom is
a big reader my grandma was always a
huge reader but honestly one of the big
reasons I kind of when I realized I
wanted to be one is how do I say this
with like I think we only have like 10
minutes left I think you can only do an
hour or something like that live and
then YouTube starts to kick you off so I
just I went through a lot of like bad
situations when I was younger and I've
talked about some of them on YouTube and
you know on snapchat and stuff but they
went through some bad situations when I
was younger and I just thought there has
to be a reason for this right like there
has to be a reason that I went through
that and so I mean I'll just it's I mean
I've said it before but I'm just not
sure who all is on this life but um I
was sexually abused when I was 11 and
when I came out and said that a friend
of mine at school came out and said that
she had been being sexually abused as
well by a family number for many many
years and like she said to me if you
would have never have said that I don't
know if I would have ever have said that
and seriously I was an 11 year old I was
like I have some more children like I
have to tell more people because more
people need to know that it's okay to
come forward and yo get and then just
kind of like spun from there so my first
book is very it goes into my story it's
not it's not my whole life is in there
but that whole situation is in my first
book and so I kind of think when I go
through something even if it's not super
bad because my second book the green
ticket I went through a situation that
wasn't like it wasn't a bad situation it
was like a funky work situation and I
still was like I can't tell people about
this because if someone else is going
through that situation maybe if they
read my book then it will help them so
every time
I go through something I just think it's
because I'm supposed to tell people it's
because I'm supposed to tell this story
so that's like truly that's truly what I
think and that's why writing books is
such a big deal to me and it's why I try
to write books it's why I try to have a
good story or lesson in my books if that
makes sense hopefully that makes sense
okay but that's really old now my hands
are shaking so I'm trying to do my
breath so that's great but yeah that's
what I think so just every time I go
through you know a shitty life situation
I think it's because hopefully my story
can help other people so that's what I
think that's why my books are such a big
deal to me so yeah that's why no no what
I think about this browse oh yeah thanks
guys
uh-huh seriously I mean that situation
like I said it happened when I was 11 so
I've had a lot of time to deal with it
I've had a lot of time to do my best to
understand it you know it's it's
obviously something that's always gonna
be with me but I don't let it define me
if that make sense so I'm I'm I am okay
and it's just a part it's just you know
it just it made me who I am today I feel
like it gave me my career is enough as
an author I don't know if I would have
been so focused aren't wanting to tell
my stories if I didn't really have any
stories to tell so yeah yeah so yeah
there's that you just never know what
you're going to talk about when you
Nicole a lot if we're going to do so
yeah
no it's okay and yeah no I'm not sad I
mean I'm not sad right now it's
something it's something that changed my
life it changed my whole family's life
it changed my mom's life it changed
everybody's life
YouTube kicked me out I'm shocked that
they waited for the 50 minute mark to
kick me out usually it's at 20 and then
40 so I should be back in if you guys
can see me again hopefully you can
hopefully can you guys see me again okay
okay okay
hey guys yeah I'm I'm super shocked like
I waited that long to kick me out so I'm
gonna try to finish up as soon as I can
but this is my bad brow so and I'm I
don't know who has the brow Wiz because
I know everybody raves about this thing
so I bought it and I feel like I'm still
trying to get used to it I feel like
it's really kind of hard like I feel
like I have to really press hard to get
product out so yeah it's hard to talk
and you do your brows at the same time
oh the brow definer why didn't I buy the
brow definer oh you look the EleFun I
don't think I've ever turned to elf one
um I just tried one recently from thrive
Cosmetics and I'm seriously just raving
about it so good but everybody said to
try anastacio but I bet I bet I would
have liked the definer even more so um
the subculture palette video it'll be
next week for sure
um it'll depend on if I film today but
I'm actually I'm glad I waited even
another day I was gonna film it
yesterday and I feel like I have even
more thoughts because I did another look
yesterday I feel like I'm just getting
more and more thoughts every time that I
use it but I think I have a pretty good
idea of what I'm gonna say so maybe like
Monday's video or maybe Thursday's video
something like that a video about what I
eat in the day mmm I don't think
anybody's gonna wanna see that video
because I feel like a lot of people do
they're what I eat in a day to like lose
weight or be healthy and
I'm not the best that you guys I'm I
don't know how to cook which i think is
a real problem and uh I just I just
don't I just don't eat very well at all
like a lot of Doritos like a lot of
Doritos a lot of chips in general
cheez-its big fan and cheez-its
coffee
cereal fruit loops mmm Froot Loops are
my jam do love Froot Loops
I have honestly been curious about
hellofresh I really happen I've been
wondering about doing it Oh does anybody
else try white cheddar cheese it's like
my jam I could eat them every day uh
nacho cheese I love nacho cheese the
best I think I'm gonna slap some mascara
on the L'Oreal voluminous Lashkar dice
oh my gosh we have like three minutes
left you guys I'm so sorry I can't
believe this was an hour I feel like it
took me 40 minutes to put two eyeshadows
on oh this has turned into like the 5
minute makeup challenge but yeah what do
we have I mean for dinner last night
like I bet I got a lot of frozen stuff
so last night we had it's just like a
frozen bag meal but it was like shrimp
linguini that was pretty good you just
cook it on the stove but yeah unless my
husband's cooking and when he has to
work overtime and he's really late like
coming home it's just like a fun for
yourself kind of thing white cheddar
popcorn do like me some white cheddar
popcorn - I'm bad at meals I don't know
how to grocery shop I don't know how to
grocery shop at all like we grocery shop
and then we come home and I'm like did
we buy anything though or no like we
just bought ice cream that was basically
it
it's really bad a lot of you guys are
saying coffee break with Danny yeah I do
I watch her I like her vlogs
I like her vlogs a lot I know she talks
about hellofresh a lot to us that's why
that's who's been like getting it in my
head is her cuz all the meals that she
makes always look so good yes I just get
snacks same here Allison I get snacks
and then I come home and I'm like how do
I make dinner out of this it's so
ridiculous like I thought it would be
one of those things like as you get
older you just kind of like
automatically know how to grocery shop
no no that's untrue I'm here to say that
that is not true I also thought it would
I would just know how to cook not true
either that hasn't kicked in okay
mascara good enough I'm gonna do a
little bit of highlight I'm gonna
highlight with the Kevin Taquan
highlighter from this book the
candlelight powder oh man I love this
highlight - what's my favorite ice cream
not chocolate ice cream from Dairy Queen
because tried to go there yesterday for
an ice cream cone and their top ice
cream machine was broken I was dumb I
would I like me chocolate mint chocolate
chip cookie dough those are probably
some of my favorites like sometimes I
just want chocolate ice cream yeah I
just want chocolate that's it just
chocolate sometimes I want to mix it up
with like the mint chocolate chip or I
love the Twix bars like the frozen Twix
bars I might go get one after this yeah
those are really good those are like you
can find them in the gas stations and
it's so hard for me to go to a gas
station and not not get one yeah now I
have cravings tea goes so great oh wait
as areas right outside my door because I
think I have to wrap this up I think
YouTube wants to kick you off after an
hour so just on my lips my lips are kind
of hurting me today I just have this
pixie ignoring lip polish on my lips
it's really good it reminds me of the
fresh wand that I have and has like I
don't know if they'll be able to see it
has like these little triggers on the
end and it feels
so um let me see if Ares is here I
thought areas right outside my door but
