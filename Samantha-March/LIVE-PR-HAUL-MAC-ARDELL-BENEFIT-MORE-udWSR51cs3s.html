I was just getting some makeup remover
wipes in case I do swatches well it's up
everybody welcome to another live I'm
like boxed in in my little corner I have
so much makeup surrounding me so I'm
like I'm like Boxton oh no I think I'm
watching my own life what I pause me I
totally am okay okay hey guys hey guys
how's it going
happy Tuesday I apologize for my voice I
was out of town this weekend hi
everybody I was out of town this weekend
and I lost my voice I karaoke it on
Saturday night so this is the voice that
we get hey Brenda hey Nina how's
everybody doing hi Carmen so like with
all of my live videos I asked um on my
Twitter I did a Twitter poll and that's
what you guys wanted to see the choices
were a PR haul a Q&amp;amp;A or just like casual
chitchat where we just like hang out
with each other and and talk and stuff
why am I like so close do I look really
close to the camera does it look like
I'm wearing a shirt there we go okay
and PR Hall one again the PR hauls wins
so much we're just funny to me because I
never really did a lot of PR hauls
because I didn't know if people wanted
to see them but I like PR hauls keep
getting voted for which is so so funny
so I'm surrounded by makeup so I'm going
to do my best to get through this as
quickly as I can
um and I probably you know with life
falls it's kind of annoying because I
kind of feel like reach around and stuff
so be aware of that Maya's here my knees
I love you so okay let's get started hi
Brooke hello hello hello everybody hi
from Germany what time is it in Germany
if you can't oh my love you Maya um if
you can't see me if there's like a bad
connection I always suggest going out
and then trying to come back in
sometimes that helps a little bit hi
Lisa
hi from New York hi from Ireland with
act I was in in Ireland it's 11 in
Germany Elden p.m. in Germany hello from
Wisconsin I was there this weekend got
some spotted cow not me
my husband and my friend so okay so I'm
gonna start with some Mac stuff because
I don't know how in the blazes I got
added to Mac's PR list let me just go
ahead and say it don't know no idea
didn't really wear a lot of Mac
beforehand I have no idea why they chose
me for their PR list so like honestly it
just blows my mind I got that huge like
lipstick package for them a couple of
weeks ago or a month ago or something
which I still can't even like fathom I
can't I still haven't even put it away
it's still sitting in my office like
probably just played because I'm like
you guys see this like that's a lot of
lipstick but they send me another
package which is so cool it came in this
like a little mesh bag thing here it
says basic bitch on it which which made
me laugh which made me laugh really hard
that's actually like a really nice
little bag and then they also sent this
hat which is kind of large because I
have a small head but it's a hat it says
rock and rubble on it would um I heard
the subculture is bad I'm yep I ordered
it this morning so we will see we'll see
what I think about it but they also sent
me this really cool beach towel I don't
I mean I'm not gonna be able to unfold
the whole thing but it's a beach towel
size fashion fanatic on it and also says
Mac it's huge and also Ares who is
staring at me right now basically
claimed it if you follow me on snapchat
she constantly lays on it basically hers
but they send it to me because they're
coming up with these new pallets hey
Katie's here yay Katie's my moderator I
think I actually put links in my video
this time so I have her linked in the
description box if you can see my links
and stuff I have her channel linked in
there so I make sure you go check her
out and say hey and subscribe and all
that fun stuff because I love Katie and
she's my friend and she's moderating
this so be cool um anyways so they sent
me this eyeshadow palette they're coming
out with the collection called Mac girls
so they're coming out with all of these
different eyeshadow palettes I believe
it's August 3rd that they're coming out
with so like the names of like the
is that they sent me makes sense because
they're coming out like prissy princess
rocking rebel basic bitch fashion
fanatic power-hungry and mischief minx
and the pals are actually really cool so
inside you get kind of like a mixture of
different things so you have some
eyeshadows and like some cheek colors
and stuff and I tried this out one time
last week I just thought the colors were
so interesting like I just really wanted
to oh my hair looks good today thank you
thank you I just really want to try it
out I was super excited about it and I
actually really like it so far I tried
some of these light purple shades in
here this pink shade I tried this purple
shade and had quite a bit of fall out so
I think I need to use it with some mac
fix+ but other than that I really liked
it it has a mirror in here so I'm gonna
keep trying it and try like this blush
shade too which looks really pretty but
I thought it was really really
eye-catching and like I said they're
coming out with six of your palette and
they'll be at Ulta - um
3950 I think it's the price yeah 3950
u.s. 4750 Canada I thought that was
really neat so I actually really like
how I'll keep playing with it more so I
can actually review it I've only done it
one time so far but I was pretty
impressed with it to be honest I don't
think I'm really ever tried Mac
eyeshadows just their lipsticks and
their fix+
and their pigman I've tried a pigment
from them too so I thought that was
pretty cool uh and then moving on oh I
got a lot of stuff I repeat okay moving
on this one really got me too because I
got another package from Kevin acual and
like how how oh this is so cool I think
this is the third yeah the third package
they've sent me and I'm just like why
like why me
I literally just I can't I can't ever
like not think why me because it's so
crazy but in each of the three packages
they sent on they send these like really
amazing tote bags they're so cool and
then they always have a quote on him -
so this quote is today I see Beauty
everywhere I go in every face I see in
every single soul truth his thought was
so awesome
but then inside like this was
so crazy they're coming out with new
concealers and they sent the consumers
they sent off on like huh I don't even
know what I'm supposed like this is just
crazy they sent that they sent all of
the concealers like I don't even I don't
even know guys I don't even know um let
me find one to swatch that I think will
be my shade but yeah that was like so
shocking I'm gonna swatch a light so we
can see what it looks like
yes the brand is very expensive but
really everything I've been trying from
him man so good this little palette
right here um this is like a little
contour book oh you guys it is so so
good open it it has these different like
contour um and highlight shades and then
some eyeshades I did not think that
highlight would be anything special but
alright it's really good and you can
find him at support too
okay so this is what the concealer looks
like and then I'm just gonna go ahead
and swatch this isn't light so I'm not
sure whoa that's really light that might
be too light for me yeah moving to the
left this way my left your left let me
know if that looks better so this is the
shade of light this might be a little
bit too light for me but it feels very
it feels very nice so that is the Kevin
Kwan concealer so I'm really excited
about that I just got to figure out what
all I'm gonna do with all those
concealers cuz I don't know man like I
know sometimes I get confused as a
beauty vlogger what I'm supposed to do
because I know everybody really likes
watches and stuff and like I've seen a
lot of people who got the package to
like you know swatching all of them but
to me then I'm like well no no what am I
supposed to do with all these concealers
that I already swatched like I would
rather
like give them to people but uh so that
is the coming up on concealers so I will
be trying that out soon I was trying to
save it for this PR haul so yay um very
excited about this and then let's see I
can't remember if I showed this in my
last PR haul because I didn't do a PR
Hall last week so I don't think I did
okay okay so um benefit sent me this
cute little package full of their brow
stuff I know I posted about it on
Instagram but I didn't think I had done
it in a PR hall I am Margaret have a
good day um so they sent me like all of
their brow products which was like so
cool and totally unexpected I don't
really get benefit PR so I don't really
know why I got this or what not but I'm
excited because I do like the benefit
brow products they're basically all that
I use except I recently started I tried
a brow pencil from Drive cosmetics which
I absolutely live um yeah there was some
confusion about like what I said about
benefit what I said was that I'm not
really like loving benefits campaigns
lately cuz I haven't been I mean that's
just the way it is but I never said
anything about like not liking benefit
or their products or anything like that
because I use benefit almost daily
either their brow products or their
Coola cookie contour stick I love that
so like I don't know there's things
about some brands that I don't
necessarily love but unless they do
something like to face so it really
really make me angry then I don't know
what to do about that so um this is all
of the brows stuff that they sent me a
lot of things I haven't tried like the
brows things which i think is this like
a pomade because if you watched my like
using samples video that was like
horrifying I haven't tried the co brow
or the three
the 3d brow tones yes Lisa not happy
with the advertising not the products
like that's all I was saying I don't
know um so yeah there's that's pretty
cool
they are also they're doing this like
brow competition thing I would say to
check out their Instagram because
they're doing like if you post two
different Oh browsing is a powder okay
okay shoot um they're doing like a
search if you post like two different
brow photos on Instagram you can get
entered to win like a trip to San Fran
and like $50,000 and a bunch of benefit
stuff so I would say check out their
Instagram if you're interested I mean
I'm probably not gonna win no contest
cuz I don't know how to do brows but I
thought that was pretty cool so yeah
that was from benefit don't know why
they sent it but like thanks like that
was awesome um okay okay next up I just
got this today these are some
foundations from actally actally I
should have it linked in the in the live
chat even that's going on right now but
I always have it linked when my video is
upload to actually is really good for um
for like beauty bloggers are creators
and you can request to get free items
from brands but it isn't exchange for a
review like nothing's really ever free I
mean I don't know sometimes but
something with like actally that's not
really free because you have to review
the product within 21 days but I was so
excited when I saw this on there and it
took forever to get to me but it is the
new Lancome 10th idole ultra wear
foundation and I didn't know but they
sent two different shades which is super
cool they sent what is this 310 bisque
cool and 320 bisque warm I love the
packaging of this it's super cool so i
swatched both of them and the warm is
what i use on my face today i think cool
will be a lot better for me like in the
winter months because it's a lot lighter
than the form but i'm wearing it today
and so far so good
love from Germany uh-oh
Tinka hey big girl so I'm wearing it
today so we'll see how it folds up so
far so good
love to putting it on felt really good
but we'll see it says up to 24 hour
where I do play volleyball tonight at
8:45 so we'll see how it lasts through
volleyball but like I've heard so many
good things that will focus light it
thought they approved I did not oh man I
really what you doing after leaves you
write basically like a proposal to the
company and you know like where you're
gonna post and what you're gonna do and
how you're gonna review and all this
stuff and uh I really gave that proposal
my all cuz that's a forty seven dollar
foundation man I was like come on please
please please please um yeah with
actally you do have to have like a
certain number of subscribers I'm not
sure what it is anymore but if you don't
have enough they should keep your
profile like on there hey Randy they
should keep your profile on there and
let you know or if you think that you do
meet the requirements you can always
like I say message them because that's
happened to me they wouldn't accept my
youtube at like twenty thousand
subscribers or something and I thought
they said you needed one thousand so I
just emailed them and they were like I'm
sorry our mistake and they went ahead
and approve me so um I would say do that
I have a link below it's like a like I
get points or something if you use the
link I don't like get money or anything
but you get like a point or ten points I
don't remember the point system I don't
have any points so but I thought that
was really cool is really excited uh
okay um okay so fresh oh hey you Trish
healthy fun fresh has been sending some
really cool packages fresh has been
sending some really cool packages they
did a thing where they sent us a package
every week with some of their new
products and it's been really awesome
and so I have two right here that I can
show so one that they sent last week is
their fresh sugar lip caramel hydrating
balm little card looks like that they
send
and then this is what the actual comic
looks like if I don't break the box I
love fresh I love their lip scrubs I'll
hop me and so good I always have one
literally hold on this is right here at
my desk just so you guys know I'm not
like right here at my desk is there
fresh like little wand perfecting one
and this is what I have on my lips right
now it actually is there honey tinted
lip treatment worried about - always
well fresh so I was super excited to
start getting some PR from them but this
is their caramel um sugar bomb that's
what it looks like it smells like
caramel
it smells very good so it looks like but
then it was super cool because every
week that they've been sending us stuff
they've been sending like every week
they've been sending products they've
been sending goodies as well and they
sent along these little caramel candies
like what drink any I know that was
really neat and I've only eaten like
five a day so thanks fresh thanks my
dennis is gonna be super thrilled about
that but then I just got this one
yesterday I think this is the last one I
thought they said they were spending
four or maybe yeah I thought they said
they were sending four and this would be
box number four and this box came with
cookies like sugar cookies are you
kidding me who sends cookies I ate one
right away
obviously obviously I ate one right away
but this was for their sugar cream lip
treatments and they're available in
three different shades so I'll just take
out I'll take out pearl just show you
it says the fresh sugar cream lip
treatment pearl nourishes and smooth the
lips ball leaving a sheer pearly shimmer
this creamy cushiony formula colts lips
with liquid color for a soft modern glow
so this is what that one looks like
does fresh gift prices um I don't do
they hold on let me look uh I don't see
anything on the card but they're
available at Sephora - when I re-upload
the video like when I uploads as a
regular video I can put the prices in
there - that helps me buddy let me just
go ahead I don't know if you'll be able
to like see that super great cuz it's
you know like a bomb but it definitely
has like a pearl shift to it ooh -
pretty oh it smells really good - mmm
mmm kind of mmm
no I shouldn't put it on over this but
that's really nice so I'm probably gonna
have to put that by my desk too and just
keep adding to the pile of fresh next to
my desk so that's awesome like all the
little goodies - oh thank you Katie
fresh lip balms are 24 or 25 dollars
yeah okay soup oh my gosh
okay I kind of wig I got a new wig you
guys huh so I got a wig I don't even
know a couple months ago and I tried it
on and just like I just don't I just
don't look very good not
okay like I don't know I like the color
and I was pink and it was pretty and I
tried every which way and people were
telling me he like pluck out some of the
front and like brush it a certain way
and do this and do that and I did and I
tried all of them i watch so many wig
videos and it still looks horrible I
mean like it looks so bad it looks so
bad so that didn't really work out but
then another company said they would
send me one and I was like I want to
give her a try cuz I really would love
to wear a wig I think that'd be so cool
um so this is from Donna love hair so I
picked out like a gray wig this says I
think this is a lace front wig yeah I
think that's what this is so I picked
out like a great one because it's like
my back and my back
sorry it kicked me out I think I'm back
if you can't see me go out come back in
I'm sorry it kicked me out it always
does right around the 20 minutes it
kicks me out
every time but this is what it looks
like so I did put it on just real quick
I mean I had like my hair and like a
weird but I didn't have the quake cap on
or anything I didn't even brush it out
or anything but I put it on and because
it's like this kind of gray with the
curls I kind of love to lie like you
know like back in the day or whatever so
I don't know I mean obviously I'm not
like I haven't done anything with it yet
but yeah this is what it will look like
here's a gist of it I don't know so let
me know I mean I have nothing obviously
I'm not like actually trying this on but
this is what the Goethe it looks like I
think it would be so cool if I can get
it to look good but they sent along a
wig cap too and a brush let me see if I
can show you so it has like the lace on
the front and then that's what the
inside looks like so let me know your
tips um you know I haven't I just got it
today I haven't even like brush it out
or done anything with it but I hope it
works like I really really hope it works
because I just really want a friggin wig
man oh so I don't know we'll try it it's
from Glee amant your makeup really
dramatic and they look big test thanks
oh oh yeah the purple I like oh I did
like that one
and so that was pretty fun so this is
from Donna love hair I'll have them um
linked when I reapplied the video but I
thought that color was really cool too
so fingers crossed I can make it work
like fingers crossed so how are we doing
on time 20 minutes we still got a lot to
talk about
okay um let's see so this is pretty cool
tweezerman
sent along a package and Maya have I
ever done by a lodge I haven't I have
not done by a lodge a lot of people are
saying go to my hairdresser I might the
bad thing is is I just went and got my
hair done like last month and I only get
my hair done like every nine months so
it's called mijo it's gonna be a while
before I go back but tweezerman said
this cool package
I was the tweezerman ambassador for the
month of July which was really cool and
they sent me a really awesome package
then they asked if I
to do a giveaway like on Instagram and I
was like of course I do
and so they sent along a package and I
thought they were just sending me
because like I got one package in the
mail and I was like okay cool this is
for the giveaway and then they sent the
exact same package I'm like wait a
second what so I'm gonna have to go
through the like double package they
sent to see you like what else I already
on so I'm gonna be doing a giveaway
coming soon to my Instagram with
tweezerman but they have tweezers
they have lash curlers in here more
tweezers in here this is like a little
spoolie and some scissors and this is
their lash comb things like that so I'm
super excited about that so stay tuned
because that will be coming soon I just
post it today on my Instagram which is
March Beauty word I have a giveaway with
Pacifica running like Pacifica's like
actually handling the giveaway tweezer
my knowledge is send out myself but
Pacifica I'll draw a winner and send it
to them and then they send out a package
so if you want to check my Instagram
that one's going on now to which that
was pretty cool but tweezerman will be
coming in the next few weeks okay okay
this next one I have a package from TRL
very cool
ahh let's see inside we high up mmm I
sent a long candy to okay this is little
a since I don't know if you'll be able
to see it cuz I was obvious like a
little candy guys coming out but they
sent along their wet skin moisturizer
and these are like really big bottles um
so that's what that one looks like it
says to what's the thing water activated
moisture works deep in the skin surface
to help repair moisture barrier
immediately absorbs and it's completely
greaseless and then oh they actually
sent - oh oh wait no this was different
wait what skin they both say what skin
moisturizer but one has like a pump and
one does the heroines trying to me
up I know I don't know but I thought
that was pretty neat and I sent along
all these little candies too so that's
fine so that's from here
okay which is awesome I'm that person
like I can't not shower ones a backup
that's I was wonder if with ones like a
refill
um I'm not that person that can like
take a shower and then not put like a
lotion on oh man we were out of town
this weekend and we did a 5k mud run on
Saturday and then we just like quickly
showered and we had to like get going
and I didn't bring a lotion which was so
dumb of me but afterwards my skin was so
dry and so gross I was like a little and
I just I just always need lotion so that
was pretty cool
from Correll okay what's next what next
okay what was my time on the 5k I don't
know because it was actually a mud run
too so we actually had to do obstacles
in between so there was a lot of like
waiting when there was like certain
really hard activities like climbing up
these huge gigantic hay bales
we had to wade in like a line for a
really long time so I mean it probably
took us less than an hour to do all of
it but it was super fun super
challenging um but yeah definitely a lot
of fun and I was a disgusting mess at
the end cuz you don't like army crawl
through mud so but you got to go down
like a really big flippin slide that was
really cool it was fun I'm glad that I
did it and then we did a mud volleyball
tournament the next day which that was a
whole other adventure oh my goodness
that was crazy but pixie beauty is sent
along another package we did the 5k in
Dubuque which is where I used to live
and where my friend matt is from to say
we did that but pixie sent their quick
fix powder which is a translucent
setting powder and then also their
makeup fixing mist which I have one of
these so I'll pop that into my giveaway
my back-to-school giveaway will be
coming soon I think I'm gonna go to
Target tomorrow and pick up um the rest
of the stuff but then also the multi
bomb chick cheek and lip which looks
like this and then
can we see the motor box yes that's
going and then also they're nourishing
lip polish which I'm curious to try cuz
I love lip stuff so yeah the weekend was
a lot of fun it was pretty crazy it was
like one of the more epic weekend stuff
in my life but this is a lot of fun but
and that was a little box from Pixy they
sent us like the nicest stuff like it
seriously they sound like such amazing
packages they're so nice
okay so Mikey wants to see the motor box
let me grab it it's over here okay okay
okay okay
so Moda sent me a box they actually
reached out to me on instagram and asked
if they could send along some products
wipe these swatches off real quick
before it like ends up in my hair on my
face or something and I was super
excited for because I'm not like um like
I don't have a ton of motor brushes yet
so this is what they sent okay it's in a
little card that said you're all set to
display the metallic way and then inside
they sent these brushes so here's kind
of a close-up of all of the brushes that
were sent over so these are from the
Mota metallics line I am just so excited
about so this one is like the bold eye
kit sorry there's probably like a weird
glare so that's all I brushes which I
love makeup all my like I don't have
makeup brushes and so we didn't show
this this brush I'm like way excited for
this is there buffer brush it just looks
so cool
not to make you feel old but your
favorite nice moves to college in 11
days yeah that makes me feel really oh
okay let me feel real old that's like
man that's just weird I can remember
vividly when you were born and now
you're doing college like that's crazy
they also send this for peace perfecting
kit which is like the oval brushes and
these are the first brushes that I tried
from them make you actually sent them to
me to try and I really ended up loving
them I think I included like two of them
in favourites videos so I'm excited to
have some more of the oval brushes and
then we have a stipler brush and then
also a contour brush too so I'm super
pumped to try all of these from Moda I
think what I think happened here because
they reach out to me what I'm guessing
is that maybe you know when I post
anything to Instagram I always like tag
all the brands in hopes that they don't
see me and maybe that's what happened
they saw that you know I was using their
brushes in a tutorial because then they
asked me on Instagram for my address so
that's how I got those ones um so that
was the mode of box okay okay okay oh my
god talk about this well I gotta talk
about this okay so I got a lip plumper
and I really wanted to address in this
video too because in my makeup I regret
not buying I got a lot of comments
asking if I gotten um lip injections
which was really funny I have not gotten
lip injections like not mad at anybody
that does not saying I'll never get
liver injections I really don't care
what people do but I personally did not
have lip injections but I got a new lip
plumper and I used it right before I
filmed that video um so I made like an
Instagram video so that will be coming
on my Instagram soon this week but it's
a lip plumper from PMD Beauty and it's
their kiss and it comes with will shoot
it comes with a serum which usually I
have right at my desk because I've been
using this so much but first you put a
serum on your lips and then it looks
like this and you just put
in the four corners of your lips
basically like top top bottom bottom and
if you can hear oh no is it not working
no oh no oh you charge it duh I forgot
you charge it on I have my charger right
over there I was hoping that you could
hear the noise which I don't even know
if you'd be able to really hear it but
basically you like suction it to your
lip and hit the button and it pulses and
you wait for it 10 times and then you
keep moving it around your lips and you
pulse 10 times literally takes under a
minute and then I just kind of rub the
cerumen and it really does look like
you've had lip injections I kept seeing
that comment on that video and I was
like no oh it's not the lip injections
it's just my new lip plumper you can get
it at Ulta in Sephora um which I thought
was really cool so I am doing like some
sponsored post on Instagram for this but
I'm really happy because I did say I was
like well you know gotta try it out just
make sure but I'm like obsessed with it
because it really doesn't work dude this
is way less scarier to me than the Apple
thing that I tried which I never could
get a good handle on that because you
had to like suction it like squeeze it
in yourself and like this weird thing
and stick it on your lips it was too
time-consuming for me and I I was like
yeah I think I notice a difference but
I'm not really sure but this this you
actually really do notice a difference
um if you haven't seen the makeup I
don't regret or makeup I regret not
buying check it out and tell me what you
think of my lips and then I'll have it
on Instagram this week a video of me
doing it so you guys can see it for
yourself but seriously it's been so
crazy I've been loving on it because I
just this time I just can't really
fathom getting lip injections that
sounds terribly no there I had no
bruising with it and that was the other
one with the Apple thing a lot of people
were getting bruises I haven't gotten
any bruises I would say the plumping
lasts for a day a day and then it goes
down so I don't do it every day but if
I'm feeling like I need to spice my lips
up I'm gonna use the lip plumper um hey
what I wanted to share this next because
yet the Apple I mean it was cool and all
but I don't know we didn't really vibe
so I got this package from ardell Beauty
which was so cool so cool I started
seeing people on snapchat and I was like
oh dang that's cool
and then I was honey I got it and I was
like seriously I wish I had cooler
reactions to getting PR cuz I'm like the
worst at it I'm like the worst I'm the
worst
but when you open it up it's just a
ginormous package I don't even know how
to get it all in there this is what our
doll set so I know I saw
I'm not been loving on ardell lashes I
put him in my makeup I changed my mind
about because I just I don't know man
they're just like doing I don't know
I'm just not loving them but what they
put in this package is they're faux mink
lashes they put two separate pairs in
there and I've never um I've never tried
they're faux mink so I'm gonna try these
maybe we'll get along better than the
regular ones I don't know but they sent
this out because they're expanding their
a line from just beyond like lash stuff
so they're coming out with more this is
seriously okay they're coming out with
more huh so they're coming out with some
mascaras so that's what one of the
mascaras looks like and then they're
also coming out this is really
interesting to me let me see if I can
find this is there stroke a brow that's
interesting um it's called their
feathering pen oh god I don't know if
I'm gonna be able to yeah I don't know
about that I mean yeah I mean I'm gonna
try it I'm gonna try it
that's for your brows okay it looks like
a felt-tip pen hold on me see if I can
oh well it's really light but can you
guys even I don't know you see that at
all maybe that won't be so bad then I'll
give it a try I'll give it a shot okay
so they're coming off some brow stuff
and then they're also coming out with
Oh with this is there a resistible
shadow stick Oh she'd ask plastic on it
I didn't realize that hey man um but
this is their shadow stick it comes up
it has a little few different colors in
there so turn out those and then the
fawn inks and then they have these
lipsticks too so this is what it looks
like just like a regular lipstick about
not sure it's going on yeah so it's
called a Hydra lipstick so I'm really
excited about these let me know if
anybody has any suggestions on what you
want to see from the Ardell Beauty um
let me know and I can try my best to do
something cool with all this but I
thought that was pretty neat that
they're you know kind of expanding and
doing some more and I really do want to
try their fo minx so um I don't know
we'll see we'll see what I think but I
thought that was pretty darn neat so um
okay I think we're almost uh I think
we're coming to the finish line guys
coming to the finish line okay so I got
these um my expressions of the best I'm
off thanks I feel like I look like a
crazy person but I got two more items
from actally they're both perfumes so
these are both um Chloe perfumes one is
a love story and one is roses - Chloe
Chloe like the original one was one of
my very first like like prestige
perfumes I'd say and I still own it and
so when I saw these I just I feel like
I'm getting more and more into perfume
and I don't know why because I've never
really been a perfume person but look at
me I have this one sitting right here
this is from Kenzo and then I have this
one sitting right here as well this is
from define me it's their Delphine
fragrance like I've just lemon I'm just
been loving on you know but this is the
Chloe de Rosas this is what the
packaging looks like I feel like kind of
gone blurry
so that's what the packaging looks like
and it's so pretty like my original
Chloe looks just like this but with um
like a gold ribbon hmm I like light
sense and this is definitely very light
and not fruity not fruity I'm also like
kind of the worst thing at describing
Francis but that one smells really good
and then the other one is the love story
and like look at that packaging oh it's
so pretty
so again these were from from actally so
they were sent to me but in exchange for
my review my husband huh I think my
husband some guys this could get real
interesting is anyone good at describing
fragrances seriously like I don't feel I
don't feel like anybody else so that's
what that one looks like like how
adorable is that packaging I think it's
so cute so let me see oh you know it
smells it smells very perfumey mmm
actually I think I like the Roses one
better mm-hmm I like that one too so I'm
really excited to try this out I just
got these as well um a lot of these
things I wasn't even able to show on my
snapchat because they came when I was
out of town so I was gone for so many
days so I came back and I was like this
is all for me like so overwhelming my
husband is home areas just ran out of
the office um let's see oh I got my I
got a new lip monthly in the bag I feel
like I haven't been talking about my lip
monthlies a lot lately because they've
just been kind of like okay to me and I
have um a discount code with them and I
don't really like to promote something
if I not like super feeling it you know
but I got this one in the mail and I was
excited to see the first thing I saw on
top was actually from Pixie and I really
do like pixie so this is what that one
looks like and it is their shea butter
lip balm in natural rose so lip monthly
is a subscription service you can get
every month and you just get lipsticks
but sometimes it's not just lip products
times it's also like I've gotten sheet
masks in there
I think I've actually gotten a bronzer
in there different things like that but
it comes with a little card and it'll
tell you everything that you got just
said you canceled it monthly because you
kept getting unwearable shades I know
they told me a couple months back that
they implemented a program where you can
actually go in and select what shades
you actually wear so that I think that's
a newer rollout for them so that could
help too but then the other items we've
got here oh this is from Monica DAR and
it is it says primetime I'm pretty sure
this is like a eyelid primer kind of
thing so there was that one and then the
other one this is a lip liner pencil
from iby beauty and then they also sent
along this is a velvet liquid lipstick
from somebody it was this from from
Houla old on neon maybe I don't that's
what that one looks like so that's what
came in my latest lip monthly like I
said I'm I'm gonna fill it with them my
code is just March beauty and you get a
55% for bag but like I said I haven't
been promoting it a lot because the last
couple just haven't really like
impressed me and I don't want to I don't
want to like suggest something or you
know especially when I have something
like an affiliate code if I'm not really
feeling it but I was excited to see
pixie this month and I'm excited about
the Monica dollar primer at the other
two I've heard iby Beauty as well but
this one I haven't heard of so we'll
have to see but that was my latest let
monthly bag I just got it today as well
I try to keep in Mike's I think they're
a newer company and I think you know
when you're newer it's probably harder
to get some of the big brands on board
at first so you know I try to keep that
in mind that as they grow and continue
you know the bags might get better and
better but um so that was my latest lip
monthly bag and then oh my gosh I swear
Rama's done I swear we have to be on
this done right right right how many
time how much 41 minutes oh my gosh
okay okay this box just came today -
this is from volition what are the two
new additions on my wall um that's my
book that's defining her my latest book
this one is a magazine article that my
town wrote about me and like they're
like monthly magazine its main Aries and
then that right there is actually a
plaque that was sent to me from actally
they sent me a little like plaque thingy

YouTube so i put it up today it was one
