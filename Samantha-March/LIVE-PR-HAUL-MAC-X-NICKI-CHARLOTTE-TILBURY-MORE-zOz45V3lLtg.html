giving me a message message okay

everybody stares they going Oh cold in
Oregon mm-hmm that's not so much fun oh
thank you Randy how are you Anna says
hello from Washington hello hello-o FC
fan hello Katie's here hello Katie
oh okay um so I did my hello hello I did
my Twitter poll and the most voted was a
new piano so I'm pretty excited I feel
like I got some some some pretty cool
products to show you I'm sorry I also
have the Cubs game on in front of me it
is mute it but it's like a playoff game
and I'm very nervous for this game so I
have to still have a dog someone got a
home run huh it's like playoffs playoffs
are here okay so I'm just gonna jump
right into it cuz they do have quite a
few things going on so I did I showed
this on snapchat and on Instagram
I wore a lipstick the other day I have a
lip swatch video that will be coming
soon so I know a lot of you guys have
seen it but uh have you guys met my
friend Nikki this is Nicki Minaj there
she is
so I was so shocked when Mac is that
we the Nicki Minaj news I was like ha
it's like they knew Aires ate those like
10 Mack lips because that she just ate
like last week it was like they knew I
don't know how they did it but I was
really surprised I um I haven't gotten
some packages from Mack in the past I
got that really huge lipstick one that
was like so overwhelming but I know I
don't get everything from them so I was
not expecting this one just having it be
the collaboration with Nicki Minaj like
I was totally not expecting that and
this huge box came and I thought what
the heck is in that box and I pulled on
the first thing I see is this cutout of
Nicki Minaj I'm like it's so funny so
these are the two colors that she like
did herself I tried them both on and
they don't really look fabulous on me
the Nicki's nude is this one right here
I have it on I do have an Instagram I
think I do so many Instagram feeds I
believe I have it on an Instagram video
that I put up yesterday I'm fairly sure
and I didn't love it I actually took it
off before I went to film a video and I
put a different one on and then the
other one is the pink print and it's
like we really really pale pink on me it
didn't look right on meet you there so I
didn't love these the best but those are
like the two that she came up with which
you know for sure
like we look slightly different so it
would make sense if they look better on
her than they're doing me so um but then
they sent along all of these I was like
no way
ah so exciting and these are all nudes
let me know which ones you want swatches
of because I can't keep all of these
lipsticks so I don't want to swatch all
of them because I'm not gonna keep in
mind rather it gives them away but I did
go through i swatched I did lip swatches
so that'll be up
soon on my Instagram of I do both of
these because I had already watched them
because I was most excited about these I
do both of these and then I have four of
the other ones yeah I did swatch still
up glasses so I can swatch those I
really do like the Mac lip glasses I'm
not even a big lip gloss person oh my
gosh I'm not a big lip gloss person and
I actually do like these can Aries have
some no she's not good
she's not getting these um I wore age
sex location that's the name of a
lipstick I think it's my favorite own by
far age sex location is in Aries is
really upset for something in the video
where I'm wearing the yellow shirt Aries
what the video where I'm wearing a
yellow shirt makeup I regret fine so
this first one is called under the
sheets I don't know we can say will see
the lip glosses really well that is
under the sheets they're both really
pretty you guys saying that areas
barking because she wants the lipstick
see what she does you doing see what you
guys are doing and then the other one is
called nu de whatever that smells I'm
mmm it's got like the dashes between it
oh no my computer just died oh oh it
just timed out that actually scared me
okay can you guys see that one okay that
one is in you de yeah I do actually like
both of these I thought they were very
pretty so that was that one age sex
location is on me in makeup I regret
fine I love it perfect nude loved it
okay it has never cut me off that fast I
mean hello I'm six minutes in you're
already cutting me off YouTube like
usually it waits till I've at least
strained for like 20 or 30 minutes and
then it cuts me off that was really rude
i know i swatched this one it's called
derriere it's more of a darker Brown
like if you like the MU I feel like the
really deep Browns your dog is still
barking so sorry about that know what
she was doing um trying to see which
other ones i swatched cuz like I said I
didn't want to swatch them all because I
can't keep them all so just would seem
pretty silly so I was just trying to
grab one but you guys want to hear a
funny story there was one that I picked
out like I looked at it and I picked it
out to swatch when I was doing the lip
swatch video and they put it on my lips
and it looked exactly like more creamer
please the one from the desi and Katy
collection from dose of colors that
didn't work for me and I was like you've
got to be kidding me
so I took it off and I picked at the red
lipstick to swatch but I was like what
see that color attracts me but it does
not it looked exactly the same on it
exactly the same I was like you have got
to be joking me this one is called
baby's alright this one right here it's
a really nice pink nude I really like to
this one hopefully I haven't edited the
swatch video I'm gonna be gone all day
or all weekend but it will be up shortly
I promise so this other one yeah i think
i swatched this one yeah this is called
mmm okay so say you guys know that one
is called mmm and that one's more pinky
so those are some swatches from there
but I was me and I was so excited but I
feel like I can now do my MAC lipstick
giveaway that I wanted to do originally
before it Aries ate some of them so now
I can I can get that one back on track I
think maybe I'm going to be doing it for
25k on Instagram so if you're not follow
me on Instagram a March Beauty word tag
a friend or something that you think
might like my Instagram because I will
be giving some of these away so that was
really exciting it's always really
baffling to me like when I get some of
these packages and I know because
someone made a comment on my snapchat
once because I don't I was like I can't
believe they sent me this like oh my
gosh I was freaking out and they're like
we you've gotten PR from that brand
before I'm like yeah but to get another
package like I don't care how many
packages are gonna send me I'm always
gonna be like you send it to me like
it's just it's like shocking to me is
like no no I don't think any of these
for granted just because Mac sent me one
thing one time doesn't mean that I
thought that I have to be getting
anything else from them so especially to
get this kind of collection with all
nude lipsticks um okay so I've been
doing really bad looking at the comments
um but my makeup I did film this for an
Instagram tutorials that will go up in
the next couple of days but I have oh
something that I was gonna show so let
me just go ahead and show that now I
have on the view I got this package from
Sigma Beauty it's their holiday
collection and this is called their
cream it's a Couture so this is what the
package will look like so they have an
eyeshadow palette and then for liquid
lipsticks and I believe this palette
like they came out it released I don't
know how many years back but a couple
years back and they're going to bring it
back which I thought was pretty cool and
so this is what the palette looks like
so it's very very pastel so I have
apricot flower in my crease and then
also the pink that I have is this red
berry rose those are the colors that I
used and then the glitter I have is the
Stila glitter in kitten karma and then I
have the blue
buuuut Coquette lashes on but so far I
mean I'm gonna have to keep playing with
this it does have a mirror which I like
I'm not to play with this but from first
glance even though these are very pastel
they were very pigmented I was pretty
impressed because I have the lorac
Brunch palette which is a pastel palette
and I liked it I kept it I bought it
myself
I kept it but some of the shades you
know you just had to you had to work a
little bit with but I didn't mind
because I thought it was really pretty
because I liked the pastels and I didn't
have anything like that but now that I
have this I feel like it's actually just
on first impression better than the
lorac one I don't I will have to keep
playing with it to make sure but I'm
excited to use some more of these shades
I believe this Sigma Holiday Collection
is releasing October 3rd I believe I
have that date right so there's that you
guys might know I am a Sigma affiliate
and this will send to me of course this
is a PR haul my code was Sigma is
Samantha if anyone is interested but
they'll lick the bollocks look the
lipsticks I was saying on my snapchat
that I actually got a little worried
because I put it on and I was like mmm
not sure if I love that because I have
this one on which is called new mod it's
the the nude in here and when I put on
the first layer on my bottom lip I was
like that's a little sheer like so I put
on a second layer and then I did two
layers on it my top lip as well and so
that was kind of like my first thought
like it wasn't like super pigmented on
the first why it likes the mother look
what lipsticks are and then it took a
little bit but I would you know kind of
do this and my my lips would stick
together for I would say like three to
five minutes maybe I think it was like
that and then once it completely dried
down it was mat transfer proof then it
felt good on the lips but I thought it
looked really good it made it through a
bowl cereal and it also made it through
us some more if you guys know me on
snapchat you see that I make s'mores
quite a bit I really enjoy them and it
still looked really good I then ate
dinner which was pasta it's 7:30 I've
had this on since about one o'clock it
finally started to fade a little bit so
I just put a lip gloss on
I was talking about the Marc Jacobs
sugar sugar gloss in the video that I
filmed for today and um so I had it
pulled out so I was thinking about it so
I put that one on but it lasted a very
long time through food without touch-up
so I was very impressed I do want to try
the other shades as well they're all
like very bright and funky here so I
will keep trying that so I can get a
full review before the October 3rd
before it releases so I can actually let
you know if I would recommend or not but
based on first impressions we're so far
so good so that is exciting but a big
thank you to Sigma sober soda yes yes
okay what do you get you guys named you
guys in the comments
everyone is bringing old palace back
everybody's bringing old everything back
it's crazy like it's it's a I don't know
man it's crazy what did I see the other
day fashion-wise the shoot what's it
called spirit is that what it was the
spirit shirts like kind of like those
baggy sweater top tank looking things
that say spirit on them I was like oh my
word that's hilarious everything is
coming back uh my highlight is from the
Smashbox kc homes pearl palette I use
all three shades in there I think that's
so pretty
oh let's see um
ray says Samantha do you request me on
PR Ellis or do they just find you right
now I really don't contact anybody I'm
mostly sometimes things show up randomly
like in my P o box because I do have my
peel box just listed on my on my YouTube
page so sometimes I don't I don't get
any correspondence from a brand and
something just shows up there if
anything is sent to my house typically I
will get an email from that brand and
they'll just say something like you know
we've seen you on you do or an Instagram
we think you'd be a good fit for this
product
um you know fill out this form and we'll
something so sometimes I know things are
coming sometimes I get emails from
brands that say that and then nothing
ever comes you know things like that so
I always try not to get like super super
hyped when I get those emails because I
know sometimes that doesn't necessarily
mean something it's gonna come but for
mostly right now I haven't reached out
to any brands myself in a very long time
but I used to I definitely used to I
would just email them and say you know
hey these are some of my favorite
products of yours I would put links in
there like oh you know I've used a bunch
of products in this Instagram look or I
talked about them a lot in this
favorites video etc I would love to be
considered for your PR list I used to do
that for sure so that's an idea if
anybody is looking for ideas Melissa
says I made like 10 a 40 brushes I might
own 10 I really might I think I'm
getting there what they're gonna get in
there it was put a lot okay he says
you've been eyeing up signa pallets hard
it's really pretty it definitely caught
my my attention as well I don't know
what it is about the pastels but they
just they do they get me they get me
brunch pellet 2.0 yeah I really don't
want to see to compare it because you
guys know I'm doing some D clutters I'm
gonna do a lipstick declutter tomorrow
the video will probably be up on Monday
I'm gonna be gone all weekend so I'm
gonna film it tomorrow but I also have I
think I'm gonna do lipsticks then
highlights the knife shadow palettes
because they are so huh cement so much
anything about the saint and sinners
palette can't remember it will be in
sunday's video it will be part 2 of the
holiday video and that one is mentioned
in there that was definitely the most
requested to talk about for the next
video airs
you got something once I get Ares has
something that she shouldn't have what
do you got wait yeah not gonna lie I
thought that was my morphe beauty
blender it's not it's uh it's like a
fake rose panel I got a book in the mail
today from an author and I had some rose
petals in it but whoo that was very
scary okay what else is in here um let
me see oh my god this is kind of random
but it's like super exciting to me this
is from a studio or studio Sweden I
think is their Instagram but it's
wireless headphones I don't own any of
these and it's so funny though because I
haven't seen any hot out on the counter
and Mitch came home and he was like you
but you but you buy tops you get those
and I was like no they were sent to me
isn't that so cool and he was like okay
I have that you know oh so we're
currently fighting over thee why are
those headphones but I thought they were
really pretty cuz they're like white and
rose gold so I thought that was super
cool so I'm like no you can't have it
because it wouldn't fit with Mitch's
vibe you know what I'm saying it was it
was bad but I'm excited never owned a
pair of these so it makes me super super
pumped so thank you Vesuvio sweden I
appreciate it so much when I put this
video when it uploads I was like a
regular video and I can fill up my
description box and everything I might
even have a code for them my god not an
affiliate code just a disc I'm back
why does YouTube keep kicking me out so
annoying
oh that's gotta go husband's home I have
a good night
oh I'm getting really frustrated it
usually doesn't kick me out into like
much later so that's really annoying but
I was just saying I was excited about it
and if I do have clothes for anything
else I will have them in the description
box when this video reuploads I should
be better and have like a list in front
of me but that's what happens when you
go alive you're not always
really ready Jaclyn's does my dog is
eating somebody sponges yeah mine too
mine too for shorts super frustrating so
okay let me hop back into it hopefully
you guys can see me again
because now no comments are coming in so
hopefully yes conceive me okay the fancy
holiday collection dude I wasn't even
doing I think I was even one of my my
snacks today and I come back and I pop
onto Instagram and it's friggin I'm
getting tagged so many times I'm like oh
gosh what happened senti beauty centi
beauty i'm like whole goodness that's
crazy
that's crazy so i really want to show
you guys this because this just came
last night and this is from a charlotte
- where are you the guy just went
speechless that room yeah and if you
guys want to hear a funny story I feel
like I'm gonna cry if you guys are your
funny story when I joined the website
actally its oh my gosh I can't open this
box now what did I do when I first
joined the website accolade do talk
about them quite a bit it's where you
can like send in proposals to brands and
it's kind of like a third like a
middleman between brands and bloggers
and and I literally can't get this box
open and you can send in proposals like
you have a free store you can look to
see what's there and you can send in to
a brand thing like you know I want to
review because of this reason and I
think I'd be a good fit here I'd post it
here etc etc they can approve or decline
it's really cool especially when I was
much smaller it was so helpful to me to
not have to be buying so many things
like you need something through actually
I thought that was
some one of the very very first brands
that I sent in a proposal to was
Charlotte Tilbury they heard a couple
items in the free store and I were on a
proposal for one and they immediately
came back into client and I was like and
then they have another item in there I
was like write a better proposal like be
more in depth about it you know just let
him know like really selling like just
do it just sell yourself girl you can do
it so I wrote this huge long proposal I
tried so hard they declined me and I was
like I was so upset like I was like dad
I just I've always wanted to try
Charlotte Tilbury but it's so expensive
and guess who decided you know forever
Charlotte Tilbury like two weeks ago or
something saying that they liked my work
and they wanted to send me a box and I
cried I cried I feel like I'm gonna cry
right now but I cried because just keep
working hard I promise you just keep
working but that's something that I
remember because you know I reached out
and I really you know tried to give it
my best proposal and you know really
talked myself up and everything and they
said no and that was through something
where actually you have to review in 21
days you have you can't it's not PR
you're not giving it just because you
get it you have to review it
whereas with PR I don't have to talk
about it at all when you get PR you
don't have to you can do whatever you
want with it
um not mention it not show it anywhere
so further than that to happen like like
it really did make me really emotional
so I just wanted to share that with you
guys that you know even if you do you
reach out and things like that then if
someone says no just wait like just wait
I have reached out to NYX before to next
was one of the first brains that I ever
reached out to and they just said
something like oh we'll take it into
consideration and then you know it was
awhile later but then all of a sudden
one day I got an email from NYX and they
sent me I thought that huge lipstick
package so just keep working hard
I really do promise like just keep
reading hard because
but I'm very excited because there's 300
products in here this one is be magic
foundations so excited love foundation
this is the flawless long-lasting
coverage and then it says some other
words I can't read this is what it looks
like and I'm pretty sure I heard my
friend Natalie from hash tag fab light
or yeah hashtag fab life I thought for
sure she was mentioning this on her
snapchat last night saying that she
really liked it so I'm very excited um
yeah Katie says it wasn't a tallit okay
that's what I thought cuz she held it up
and I was like wait a second did she
talk about this one so this is what the
foundation looks like I'm scared to even
look up what the price of this would be
because who the heck knows but I'm so
excited the shade they sent me is in
five medium hopefully it'll work though
and then they also sent me this is the
unisex healthy glow all of your
hydrating summer tinted moisturizer oh
my goodness Oh $44 okay not I mean
expensive but that is how does bad as it
could be that's for sure no the
packaging is just so fancy okay so
here's what that looks like okay so that
is the summer tint moisturizer and then
the other one that they sent is the
light wonder this is a youth boosting
perfect skin foundation we didn't know
wait a second I thought this was
something else I don't know why I
thought it was something else but okay
so here's what this one looks like all
the packaging is crazy so it says for a
daily luminous tint blend a small amount
onto your skin from nose outwards for a
more and more flawless glowing finish
Pat on top of areas where extra coverage
is needed using a brush so I'm so
excited with this one's very liquidy it
doesn't shake well it sounds very
liquidy so I'm so excited like
oh man yeah so I want to share that
that's started with you guys as well
because it was one of the first things
that popped in my head when I got the
email from them saying that they wanted
to send me something I was like you guys
are rejected me not that long ago so
it's really good so I'm just I'm really
excited so yay um okay so there's that
one
all right look through together let's do
together say yeah I'm so I can't wait
I'm going to try the foundation ASAP huh
all right yeah these are my first
charlotte items that I'm ever trying so
I am just so excited hi from orange
county callie
oh good
Cassie says I love your makeup today
thank you thank you um M &amp;amp; M rule M&amp;amp;M
royalty did you say something about do I
share this with my husband the
experience yeah he gets to see he gets
to see a lot of it um he was actually
with me when I don't know why I said on
my feet he was actually with me when we
had to go down to the FedEx store to
pick up my package from morphe when it
was the Jaclyn hill palette he came home
because I missed it and you had to pick
it up in person like you couldn't even
just sign for it so we had to go all the
way downtown and it was a long drive and
he got home from work and I was like I
really want to go pick up at this
package because I was able to see that
it was from morphe and so many people
are saying it's the Jackson Hill palette
now I'm like no it's not there's no way
I can't be but I was like but I still
want to go pick up whatever morphe is
sending weeks that was my first package
from morphe so he drove me down one and
um we got the package and we got back in
the truck and I was just kind of sitting
there and he goes well aren't you gonna
open it and I was like yeah so we had to
like pull over and so I could open it
and you know he was watching my reaction
and he thought that was pretty cool so
yeah you get to see a lot of it
you see you get to see a lot of it um
let me grab this over here uh okay so
this was pretty cool like this was
really closely so I got this package
from Pierre cosmetics in the mail and I
was actually pretty surprised to see
this because they sent the if I can open
it
they sent the new palette that they are
putting out with celebrity makeup artist
at TN ITN Ortega and I was surprised to
get it because a pure actually reached
out to me and asked me to do a Instagram
a story takeover for them using this
palette and so I did I did it last
Friday home and I was so overwhelmed you
guys are so nervous
I've never done Instagram stories
takeover and then to do it for one of my
favorite brands I was like I don't know
what to do I'm so scared I was so
nervous but so they sent me the palette
so now I have another palette so I was
like oh just surprised they send me
another one um but very cool because of
my 30k giveaway is gonna go up on
Tuesday and I'm this will be good now
huh cuz I thought that was really cool
so that eyeshadow palette will go up in
that giveaway but this is avoid the
palette looks like Sosa knows my palette
so that's the pure pro and etienne and
then inside you do have a mirror and
then these are all of the different
shades so you I mean you have quite a
variety in here when I did my takeover I
focused it around this shade which is
midnight that was a really cool shade
like maybe dig a little deep Navy
Sparkle it was really pretty these two
shades right here I used to a 1988 and
Adobe Adobe is one of my favorite
favorite shades it's this one right here
it's a beautiful kind of kind of like
that 90s red color lip color that
everybody loves that's what I think of
Adobe popular is like the perfect brown
I'm so glad they have that one
there but it also used penny on my eyes
what video was that I was wearing a
green tank top I can't remember but I
have this look on and one of my past
videos where I have a green tank top and
I used penny all over my eyes and that
one was really gorgeous so I'm still
kind of working my way through it but so
far so good
I thought they blend it so well that was
what I was most impressed about Oh
Bruney says he thought I did a good job
on the takeover thank you I was sorry oh
I'm so nervous
oh man but yeah so so far I think it's
going really well I haven't found a
shade like I haven't tried a shade yet
on my actual eyes that I thought was a
dud not saying that there isn't because
I haven't tried every single shade yet
but so far so good on the pier and a tan
palette and I look for it in I can't
give away Melrose is the altar cart
video yes I think it was yes yes yes I
think it was that one okay hey blue-eyed
Jesse says you should start your own
makeup brand you would do amazing I
would have no idea I would have no idea
how to even start that would be super
cool but I would have bad songs that
sounds like a lot of work um so next up
I got a couple single shades this is a Z
palette actually that right friend
Mickey made for me isn't it so cool and
so I got some single shades from
Christiana and cosmetics so I just have
like some glow shades in here and it's
magnetic look so Chris in and sent me
these shades right here
if you guys haven't checked out Kristina
and Cosmetics yet I really recommend
that you do if you really enjoyed like
supporting indie brands or you're
looking for new indie brands I believe
she's cruelty free I know she's cruelty
free I think she's vegan too um I've
tried her I think she came out with
lipsticks first and I tried the
lipsticks and I really enjoyed them
she's got some really cool shades in
there and then she came out with an
eyeshadow palette and now these single
shades and they are really really cool
so the names are kind of weird so
probably gonna butcher them but this one
is in Gaia Gaia I think like dig
Michelle says you feel abyss palate
things to me and you love it yeah that's
awesome that's fantastic and then we
have this hot pink one which is called
eros so there is the pink one and then
also I'm just really attracted to these
blues right now I think this is a very
trendy color so I was really glad that
she put that one in there this is called
a rebus Oh like that is so pretty these
feel like makeup geek foiled shadows is
like how I would oh there it is
is how I would uh how I would compare
them to I do i know i have a code with
crystianna i think it's just march
beauty as my coat there but again I
really I really would suggest I've been
using her for at least at least a year
um I have been trying out her line so
this one is called Tartarus I'm like
butchering all of these names but
there's that one sucessful you put these
names in the description box yes when
the video goes up as a regular video I
definitely will I'll have my code in
there too I love that gold so beautiful
so that way you guys
yes Greek mythology Melissa yes this one
is NYX I don't know danielís if she's
on Etsy I don't know if she's on Etsy I
know that she has her own I mean she has
like the own her own brand website and
everything I think it's just christina
and cosmetics calm and for instagram is
christina in cosmetics as well so again
if you guys would be interested the
video uploads pretty fast but it'll be
you know within a couple hours i'll have
you know all of the links and everything
up and there
you know these are all of the shades I
felt like they all were really you know
the exact same from one another except
the pink one was just it almost felt a
little bit dryer everything else was
like very very smooth and foiled the
pink one was the only one that I felt a
bit of a difference with a swatch wires
but I think there's oh pretty so that is
from Christina and cosmetics okay we are
almost done
yes I can feel it we are almost done
okay um I got some my first package from
and I know I'm gonna know what's wrong
with Dell young tools DeLeon that I use
me bdellium tools so they sent me some
brush cleaners which I have to say makes
me pretty excited so I just got these
can I open it yeah
without the beat Delia oh okay tell you
the tools yeah there we go that makes
sense okay so this is what the first one
looks like this says cosmetic brush
cleanser with cleaning pad it will clean
condition sanitize both natural and
synthetic brushes this one says it's in
ocean breeze oh so it's just like a
little soap in there ooh okay
oh and look at the the cap has a little
uh it's like this Sigma cleaning max
that's awesome because I always if you
could look in my bathroom I just always
have a little bar of soap sitting on top
of my Sigma mat actually so let's pray
to me and then I just go in and clean my
brushes here's my Sigma mat and then
boom there we go so that is really cool
I'm excited to try that out literally
it's just gonna sit there soon because I
feel like every day I'm trying to clean
at least one brush sorry so this one is
in citrus the lemon was really cool that
they have different scents and you
really can smell them so that one is
citrus lemon and then again it's the
exact same thing so this is Del u m--
tools
awesome so it says you just wet brushes
in warm water you swirl and soap to
lather work the bristles of your brush
back and forth on the silicone and
cleaning pad which is located in the cap
to remove makeup residue rinse and
repeat boom
oh my gosh I'm so excited that's this
mmm this is needed for me I literally
feel like I'm cleaning a makeup brush
every freaking day it's crazy so a big
big big thank you to tell young tools
for sending me these two guys I will be
trying those out I'll let you know what
I think go ahead and wipe these swatches
off I think I just got two more two more
items to show you we're at 37 minutes
I'm shocked that shocked
they haven't kicked me out again okay
Brittany says wish I could hear you over
my one-year-old screaming dad huh oh no
that's funny let's see Oh Catherine says
coffee break with Danny loves daily
Tools cool that's awesome um how much
did they retail for I don't think they
didn't send me anything
I don't see anything on there let me see
if I can look it up later okay um let's
see blush it's $20 looks like 20 others
on the website so let's see yeah a lot
of you guys use different soaps - I
usually just get a like mara-vee-oso
and I did that one quite a bit so yeah
but the Sigma matte is so helpful I I
Sigma my it's awesome I have five - mats
and then I also have like the tower that
can store the brushes but then you can
also clean brushes on it I don't know a
lot of makeup brushes and even though I
own a lot of brushes I still feel like
I'm almost cleaning them it's weird okay
so let's see
here this package was so like oh man
again uh this is from Benefit Cosmetics
and the thing is so freaking I don't
know man
this is called their abracadabra brow so
when you open it it's just it's just
kind of silly like you can like pull on
these things and things happen and then
you turn the next page and it's like a
whole like pop-up book like thank you
and then see the next page and the next
page has more of these like oh no this
was like a flipbook what well it's like
it's a good book oh I mean like who
thinks that stuff like this honestly
what I don't know they have even more
and then I think the next page is even
like more of a foot yep flip up type of
thing I mean I was like what else what
is going on and then I got to this last
page and something popped out in the Hat
its they came out with this new product
it's called the foolproof brow powder
there we go foolproof brow powder and
inside so this is their new product I
used it today so this is what it looks
like it's a powder both of them are
powder and they say like you put the
lighter side towards the front of your
brow and then the darker towards the
back and the applicator is really
interesting because it's kind of like it
reminded me of the Estee Lauder one that
I just tried in my recent trying new
makeup I think it was and then there is
a spoolie on the other end I honestly
thought I would like it and I was
excited to give it a try because I tried
that Estee Lauder one and it had this
type of applicator
it was a powder and I did it the regular
Estee Lauder pencil and then I came in
with the powder and I was like well like
I felt like it just really did make my
brows look better and I got so many
compliments in that video on my brows
that I was like okay great and so I used
it again a couple times and I was like
still really liking this so when I saw
this I immediately thought of that but I
don't know you guys can tell me what do
you think about brows I mean they've
been on for a while and I've worked out
and taken walks and stuff but it was
kind of difficult I don't know I'm gonna
have to keep trying so it was only a
first impression but it was kind of I
felt like it was almost maybe a little
difficult to pick up the product and
then I felt like it wasn't really going
in my brow super smoothly like I don't
know it was just kind of I wasn't I
wasn't really sure what was going on but
I'm gonna keep trying I'm gonna keep
trying for sure because I'm interested
in the concept but I don't we'll just
have to see this was a shade three and
then also like on this last page like
you for you open like these little
things they come with more of the
foolproof brow powders I think this was
shade one and this was shade five if I
have that correctly so I think that's
all Kitty um Katie you know some comment
from Katie Katie said I think there are
a few other products in there aaanthor
thought I saw more in another unboxing I
have to do the two other brow powders is
that what you saw um because I have the
two other brow powders but I don't know
if anything I mean literally there's so
many freaking like pages of this book
and everything and I'm like like I mean
I okay so don't give me I don't want I
don't know how to say this without
coming off the wrong way because I am
always going to be very grateful for
every package I get I was grateful for
this one as well
but I just kind of wondered like how
much money did it cost to put this
together
because like I don't know to just think
just just I'm like oh and I just I feel
weird saying it because I don't want to
make it seem like oh my gosh
don't mean that or like cuz that's not
what I'm trying to say but I'm just like
it just seems like a lot like it just
seems like a lot it just is not
overboard and I don't know that's just
me though but I don't know I know a lot
of you guys are saying that you guys are
are thinking the same way so yeah it
just seems like a lot of money in
advertising but I guess huh like I would
have been super happy with like a sucker
you know that would have gone a long way
candy bar
I'm very easy to please saying oh my
gosh the benefit brow boot camp I was
talking about it on my snapchat last
night seriously so benefit Rea a contest
and they let people they took like was
it 20 contestants I think till Lake
Tahoe and they had different influencers
as like the team leaders and then people
are having to do all these intense
challenges and I'm like oh my gosh like
I said on my snapchat like can you
imagine me at a brow boot camp I would
be in the corner just crying like they'd
be like come on man we gotta go do the
next challenge I'll just go with my
brother oh my gosh I totally I did not
enter the contest of course but not that
I would ever thought I would have won
because I feel like they would look at
my Instagram I'll be like no girls oh
but man they were making him do some
crazy things like uh like recreating
brows like celebrity brows I would have
had no idea you had me a picture of
someone's brows and say recreate them I
would like trying to like crumple up the
piece of paper and like popping in my
mouth really fast would be like we do I
can't thank you I would have been like
oh no okay so is the benefit Prabhu camp
has been so intense I can't handle that
man I can't I can't handle it I think
it's a cool like I'm I hope more
companies do things like this because I
think it's cool like letting other
influencers and then even non
influencers I don't know if everybody on
there was an influencer I'm assuming but
I don't know that for sure but I think
that's really cool because you always
see these influencer trips with you know
the people who have a million and two
million and things like that and it
would be super cool to be able to go
somewhere with a brand side I think
that's cool what they did for sure I
just want to be able to do grab boot
camp that's a no-go for me but uh yeah
you use the stick in the mud to make a
perfect route go like oh no I good I
can't I can't handle that guys okay um
let me grab the last product here okay
so this is the last one that I got karen
says hi and you get those you couldn't
handle brow boot camp no no don't be
