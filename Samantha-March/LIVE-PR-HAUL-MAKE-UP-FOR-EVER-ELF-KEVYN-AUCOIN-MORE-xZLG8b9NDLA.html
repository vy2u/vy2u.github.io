hi everybody I was trying to this like
tripod just drives me crazy like my
camera is like it literally wobbling or
my phone is like wobbling back and forth
on it and I'm like I'm just starting
it's gonna drop off at any moment so hi
everybody hi Bri and I declare hi
crystal how's everybody doing today as
always I feel like I'm too close to the
camera so I'm gonna back up a little bit
I swear this happens every week I don't
know why I don't just learn to just back
up and I feel like I'm too short so now
I'm gonna sit on my legs hi everybody
okay so what we're doing today is oh
yeah it's your first ever life hi hey
everybody what is going on okay um I
should be closer really okay come back
I'll come back I never know because it's
so weird looking at the camera cuz I
remember the first time I did a live I
was like oh my gosh you can't like see
anything at all and then when I actually
watched on the replay I was like you can
see so much more it's so weird because
it like cuts me off in weird ways I
don't know so it's always kind of hard
to gauge what I actually look like so hi
Trish how's it going hi
Lolita hi everybody so I do a poll on
Twitter every week and ask what you guys
want to see for my lives on Tuesday and
once again it was a PR holiday Melissa
you just locked in Newark nice um but
yeah it was another PR haul and honestly
I'm just I'm just super surprised
because I guess I always thought people
didn't really love PR hauls because I
feel like every time you watch a
youtuber do a PR haul they have to be
like I just want to say I'm not bragging
and I'm not this or that it's like they
almost feel bad doing the PR hauls you
know what I was saying and and I know a
lot of people have said recently like
I'm not gonna do PR house anymore
on my channel etc etc so when I'm doing
these polls on Twitter and PR hauls are
winning
almost every single time I'm like okay
like that really tells me something
honestly so thanks everybody who comes
over to my Twitter and votes because it
really does help me out and it's it's
just kind of been knowledgeable to have
those so in my too-tall now let me know
if I'm too tall I'm sitting on both my
legs so yeah oh okay um so I'm gonna get
started I mean since because I've been
doing the PR hauls so much I don't have
I don't have as much to shell but I just
I remember last week we were here for
like 50 minutes or something it was kind
of crazy um but this week I mean I feel
like I have lots of like really good
stuff but like quantity wise it's not as
much as some of the other ones but I
feel like quality wise for like some of
these things oh man it's so exciting
okay so I'm just gonna read through some
of the comments I just so wish to have a
better set up one day because I don't
have a table or anything in front of me
so it's so hard so everything's over
here but I wish I could have a table to
set my laptop in front of me so I could
actually read all the comments hi
Jacqueline because um where was I going
with this
oh because when I'm watching the
comments on here I can only see three at
a time they scroll so fast and I know I
can catch it on my laptop but then I'd
have to constantly like be doing that
and that would just be super annoying so
one day I'm gonna get like a real table
or vanity or hey Katie Katie is my
moderators everybody say hi to Katie uh
one day one day it's gonna happen I can
feel it I can feel it okay where should
we start let's start with this one
because this one just made me so excited
hi Natasha okay so this thing is so
excited cuz I still can't freaking
figure this out guys like how the brain
Kevyn Aucoin
like how did I get on their radar yeah
someone guys tell me that because holy
shiznit like this just crazy to me they
send me another package and man man
was excited about this one this is
called the making faces beauty book so
this is what it looks like
and Kevin upon it can be found at
Sephora so when you open it up it looks
like this and it's actually like a
little magnetic book so you open it like
that you have a mirror but then these
three all pop out and there's three
different books in here so it says
chapter one is contour and then yes I
used self culture on my eyes today
chapter two is blush and define and then
chapter three is emphasize eyes man so I
always heard really good things about
the Kevyn Aucoin brand I always heard
really good things about his sculpting
powder and it was actually something
that I tried to buy I think it wasn't
the last sephora vib sale there was like
a duo and one side was a sculpting
powder and I think the other side was
either a blush or a highlight and it's
sold out I was like what during the vab
so that's kind of quite as expensive so
like I was nobody to everyone we sell
and then I sold I don't know super
disappointed and the next thing I know
I'm getting packages like Jaime it's
just so crazy to me but I have been
using this whole man I love this I have
his oh I tried to organize last night so
it's actually in a drawer now but they
sent me like they're cut his contour
book too and it had the sculpting powder
in it but this I love this too this is
what the inside looks like of the
chapter one so you have the sculpting
powder in medium a highlight and candle
light and then a bronzer in desert night
I keep using this I can't stop so good
and it's just all so good it's just bad
it's just all so good and then the
chapter two is blush and define and then
that's what that one looks like the
highlight honestly I should I should I
should see if it's a dupe for the
essence pure nude I'll swatch it I don't
have makeup wipes close to me but that's
okay um because it's not like
it's not like metallicky or like really
glittery it's just I don't know how to
describe it like a natural highlight but
look better but that makes any sons like
I don't even feel like it even like I
don't know can you see it's watching on
camera okay I'm on my phone so sometimes
the quality can be strange but it's just
so pretty it was much more than just
looking at it in the pan I was kind of
like but it's super super pretty um yeah
I don't know if you'd be able to see
this watch uh I will have a video on
Instagram in like two days or something
and I'm using this whole thing so that
will be going up and I can try to use it
more chokes I think it is just so so
pretty oh thank you oh thanks guys um
this is the blush and define one is so
nice and then chapter 3 is the emphasize
eyes so that's what that one looks like
I really need to get into this but yeah
I just got the subculture so I've been
using these so culture like repeatedly
on my eyes um not even just to test it
out anymore I just freaking like it I
don't know I know I've been watching I
was trying not to watch um a lot of
review videos before I did my review
because I just didn't want too many
other thoughts in my head and so this
morning I mean I've just been watching
so many reviews I'm Michelle
hi Sarah I'm just watching there's so
many reviews and it's just really it's
really interesting all over the board I
have to say I keep getting upset though
with the people that just keep running
the brush and running the brush and
running the brush and I'm like do you do
that in any eyeshadow palette because I
don't I don't get it what are you doing
that Margaret today's your last day of
school forever no way that's amazing Hey
you go girl
okay so that was the making faces
beauty book super excited about that I
love the first one if you haven't read
the sculpting powder yet I highly highly
recommend it though it's so good I just
got these in the mail last night this
was from octiline octoly is where like
if you're a beauty blogger you can like
send proposals to brands and then they
send you product in exchange for your
review and I got a foundation from she
won't she I did not think they would
accept my proposal that's for sure but
hey and then they sent three different
foundations I'm like why how do some 300
pound Asians but so a huge thank you to
them and actally this is what the
packaging that looks like the outer
packaging and then they sent three
different shades perfect vanilla perfect
praline and then perfect honey so I
don't know I thought I select it perfect
honey so mmm this is what the packaging
looks like okay oh it has a pump I
looked it up on the Sephora website this
is $51 so we will see oh yeah it looks
super liquidy it says is a fluid
foundation yeah that looks super liquidy
has SPF 20 I'm gonna try it soon I'm
gonna try it soon but I just got a
little sample of this laura mercier
flawless fusion ultra long wear
foundation it was like a weekly special
at Sephora so uh yeah so I've been
trying that I have it on today and I
tried it on yesterday
it is like super full coverage I'm not
used to full coverage so that kind of
like close me off guard but I wanted to
see how long wearing it is because we
don't buy or don't buy we don't play
volleyball until 8:45 tonight so I put
this on it like new and maybe new one
and I'm gonna see how well it lasts and
then how it lasts through volleyball but
big thank you to actively Givenchy for
some new
Foundation um what I keep feeling like
I'm blurry like there we go okay let's
see what do you guys talk about super
liquidy but the coverage isn't saying
yeah I feel tell just in the in the
bottle that it was super liquidy and I
saw it says that you're supposed to
shake it before you use it
so I'll make sure to do that yeah thanks
everyone who watched my yeah the focus
is like being weird I don't know if it's
cuz I keep having to go in and out but
yeah thanks everyone who watched my soap
culture thank you girl
thank you thank you to everyone who
watched my cell culture video I was
super nervous about it and just like I
don't know I just felt like I was in a
weird mood like you know everybody is
like so going crazy over this palette
and I still like it I'm still playing
with it and and whatnot but it wasn't
something that I watched and was like
earth thought I played wasn't
immediately I was like hold on that for
me I still really like it and the shades
are still working out for me so I don't
know I'll keep trying it um but this
this package oh man
the timing on this one was so so crazy
because I got a freaking package from
makeup forever
like wake up forever ah it's so insane
to me like it's so insane to me but the
timing was so weird because if you watch
my video doing the sample challenge I
actually used a sample of this
foundation and in the video I was like
wait a second this foundation is amazing
how come I never knew about it etc etc I
immediately went to Sephora I put it on
my loves list was planning to buy it
went through like looked at all the
different shades and stuff and tried to
pick out my shade and then I bring in
this is so exciting especially to get
this foundation was so cool but somehow
I don't know the shade isn't totally
great for me it's a little bit light but
that's fine that's fine because I love
to bronze so
it's fine but yeah this foundation Rock
man I love this foundation so much oh so
it's so overwhelming to get noticed by
some of these brands like with a vise
bottle it's just so overwhelming you
know and then they sent two primers as
well I love this primer the smoothing
primer I have a little deluxe sized
sample of it and I love it so now I have
the full-size and then they also sent
the hydrating primer and I've never
tried this one so I was so excited to
get that and then they also sent along
their mist and fix so their makeup
setting spray so this is what that one
looks like and I have a sick sick
obsessions with the makeup mist so I'm
really excited to add this one to my
collection so that was awesome
oh man that was awesome so my hair is
like super straight today you guys does
anybody else have the hair like me where
you just don't know what you're gonna
get on a day-to-day basis like sometimes
I wake up and my hair is like really
wavy and then sometimes I wake up and
it's super straight and then some days I
wake up and it's like wavy on the side
but straight on the side and it's like
what I never have any idea what my hair
is gonna turn out like this next package
I just got so I haven't even opened it
it just came so this is from a nude
sticks and it's a little package here
and it says nude is the new black yeah
yeah that is funny
I like reading about you guys hair
problems it's so weird like I just I
don't know sometimes I wake up and it's
completely different like whose hair is
this how am i some days I do the thing
where I won't put conditioner in my hair
and I put mousse in it so like kind of
make it even more curlier like like I
don't know what kind of
like weird curls that I do can I take an
e transfer no I don't know what that is
I don't know um we have sometimes I do
that and then sometimes when I do my
hair is like both and then other days I
do it it's just always like right on my
boy
so weird I never know what I'm gonna get
okay so inside is two little guys here
so let's see the first one on it says
Haven on the side here
okay so let's see inside is I let their
packaging in their little tins so this
is a lip and cheek balm in Haven this is
what it looks like and then this I don't
know what this is then it also came with
this I'm not sure when I was oh it's a
sharpener there was a sharpener in there
okay so there's plastic on it I just got
it so I oh there we go so that's what it
looks like so that is in Haven a lip and
cheap bomb okay and then the other one
that they sent is in siren and this
looks to be a red oh wait worried okay
wait for it okay so this one is siren
okay that was from nude sticks I'm
pretty new to new sticks oh that's so
cool they're little tin has a mirror net
that's awesome the plaque behind me it
was actually from octoly they sent it to
me when I got twenty thousand YouTube
subscribers which was super cool so I
had to put it up cuz I thought that was
really neat I thought was really sweet
that they do that I've never really seen
another brand like that
do that for creators so I thought that
was pretty cool
hi from Oklahoma hi what has been my
favorite pure package I've received this
bar like like ever
honestly I want to say it probably was
the Morphy Jacqueline Hill that's like a
that's like something I feel like I will
never forget that moment and I think I
think a part of it too which is I was so
shocked and so surprised I've never
gotten anything from morphe so like the
first time to get that was so
overwhelming and like I feel like I'm
gonna cry but like I can remember
opening the box and just being like what
what if this is insane and then even I
had like the little TV in it and like
Jacqueline was doing the whole video and
stuff like it just made me I don't know
it just gave me all kinds of feeling so
that one was really cool and then
definitely the Mac box yeah my hands
were shaking they were it was really
cool that my husband was there with me
because that was like a whole meal that
was crazy cuz you actually had to be
hand at the box in person
I'm I wasn't here when they came to
deliver it and I left a note on my door
and instead of just being like oh I can
sign the note and then stick it on my
door and you come back tomorrow and
deliver it they were like no you need to
come here and pick it up in person and
I'm like wait why I didn't know I didn't
know why it was so weird so much
actually drove me down there so that was
cool that he was there too but yeah then
the Mack box with all of those lipsticks
and it was like so overwhelming because
once again that was my first package
from Mac so just to you know not expect
anything at all from these big old
brands and you know brands that I love
and stuff to have those be the first
things that I was getting from them it's
just super super overwhelming and just
so just a really good feeling I think
it's like I think it's a really good
feeling because I know personally how
much of everything that I've put it into
this and put into YouTube and and all of
that and when you see the rewards coming
in and not only just the PR but even
just sitting here live and getting to
see all these comments coming in is
really amazing or to get emails I
I used to print off every single email
that came in just from anybody just
saying like you know I feel friendship
with you or something I would print it
off every single email and then I just
had to buy more printer ink the other
day and I was like maybe I should start
like a folder or something on my
computer because my printer is kind of
getting mad at me you know feel like I'm
wasting trees but it's just it's so
special and so rewarding in all these
different ways so that's all I want to
say sorry got off track I got a track uh
okay but really where I we're almost
done so that's not too bad we're 20
minutes away or we're 20 minutes in so
what's next one I got this package
that's this I have a bad connection
oh does I have a very bad connection so
hopefully we'll make it okay usually at
20 minutes YouTube kicks me out
typically so if I get kicked out just
try to come back in it usually lets me
come right back in but usually around 20
25 30 minutes it kicks me out so that
happens so I got this package from
Madison Reed you guys I don't know why
when I open a box from Madison Reed I
thought of that website that like I
can't remember what it was called but
wasn't it like two women's names but it
was where you would go to like cheat on
your spouse's or something I was like an
online thing and I was like why am I
getting a box for Medicine read it can I
scared me at first that's not it that's
not what this boxes it is actually for
your hair and so this is what I actually
Madison that I was I passed braided what
is this is this for me so this is what
the box looks like and I actually I
figured out it was from preemie which is
another website that connects bloggers
and brands and so I got some haircare
products to try out which I'm really
excited for because since we were just
talking about hair like I really do
nothing with my hair medicine not
veterinary uh I didn't like nothing
my hair I mean I'd like shampoo and
condition it and like sometimes I try to
put in like a volumizing spray but I
really don't think anything else so it's
kind of excited to get this because we
have like a color protecting shampoo and
conditioner has anybody tried this brand
so I would love to know so we got a
shampoo conditioner and then also in
here was a color reviving gloss so
that's kind of cool
and then also got a lightweight styling
cream I don't think I've ever used a
styling cream like I don't even know how
you use it I don't even know what to do
but I'm gonna figure it out because this
doll sounds great
and then also a smoothing finisher it
says control frizz and shield hair from
color fading I typically always have
really frizzy hair it really helped me
like so frizzy I'll tell you guys an
embarrassing story I've always that
search for the hair but I feel like my
ears stick out
like especially this one like look at
that like what what are you doing so I
always feel like my ears stick out but
when I was in high school I always
wanted to be a cheerleader I loved
dancing and okay I love dancing and
stuff and here okay
oh thanks giddy Katie's here okay okay
um okay what was I saying
so my ears stick out but I always wanted
to be a cheerleader but I didn't want to
wear my hair up because my ears would
stick out and it would embarrass me so
much
so I mastered like the ponytail with
like the whispies by my ears and whatnot
but then my hair would always be so
frizzy I'd want to put my hair up but I
didn't want to because then my ears
would stick out so then I would try to
leave my hair down but then it would be
frizzy it was really rough like in high
school like it was rough
ruff I hated it I felt like I couldn't
win either way hair up hair down not
cool but then I stopped washing my hair
everyday like I only wash my hair twice
a week and I very rarely deal with frizz
unless it's like super super human
that's the only time I really deal with
frizzy hair so if you struggle with
really frizzy hair what helped me was
just stop washing it just stop just stop
oh okay we only got one more box to go
so that's awesome
and it's from ELF like speaking of
brands that I can't believe I managed to
catch their attention is else like come
on okay wait you guys want me to come to
Ohio what I wonder how far Ohio lism
here can't be too far I don't think but

blazing temps I've pulled together some
of our hottest new products to help keep
you dewy instead of dripping that's
awesome okay I would love to go to

couple things from ELF a couple things

black bandit and it has its own little
like sharpener too so that is cool and
then also another eyeliner pencil in
twinkle teal I would love to go to
Australia that's like on the top of my
list that would be awesome

glosses one is in mocha twists I think

glam I would love to go to Utah I mean I
want to go to all these places la
Hungary yep on about I want to go to all
of them Arizona we almost went to

ended up going to Colorado instead I
have been to Canada

back Dubai that would be amazing
Nicaragua I want to go to all of these
places okay sorry read in the comments
I'm just seeing all the places that you
guys want me to go I hope to go
everywhere like it has always been my
goal to travel everywhere everywhere
that I can I have the I have to travel
tattooed on my foot and I think it was
like oh yeah Cedar Point I've always
wanted to go to Cedar Point in Ohio
Germany that would be cool yeah Colorado
was such a good time like such a I would
love to move there I would love to move
there I have never wanted I never
pictured myself staying in Iowa ever so
for me to be 30 and I'm still in Iowa
I'm like what happened here
how how did this happen I would love to
go to Colorado I'd love to move there
though that would be amazing Greece is
on like the absolute top of my list
I'm not wait no I don't think I've ever
been in Michigan i I have no
meet-and-greets planned at the moment
I'll be at the Iowa State Fair on Friday
you know anyone else from Iowa I'll be
there on Friday that's all I got um one
more thing from ELF though this is a
eyeliner pencil in iconic ivory I'm
sorry the Sun is kind of being weird
thank you for saying I don't look 30
we've just become best friends
I love bring all the comments and seeing
where all you guys are from that's so
cool
yeah I really I never I never did think
though and once we went to Colorado I
felt like I had my husband like really
close to being convinced to moving to
Colorado the hard part for me is that
I'm in a military family so I don't have
my family around me so kind of what I
always thought was that I would because
I lived in Dubuque Iowa
I went high school there and then I went
to college in Des Moines and I just
always thought after I got done with
college I would start to go travel with
my family and travel around with them
they move every couple of years so that
was always my goal and then I met my now
husband we started dating when I was 19
and then we've just never loved Iowa his
family is close by though and he's
really close with his family and I
really I mean I get along with his
family great so it's nice that they are
close by but I still always that's I'm
still trying to convince them I thought
Colorado would be good I thought he
would like it too
you know it's like outdoorsy still
things to do but then it's also not Iowa
big part not Iowa and it's close to
other places like it's obviously a lot
closer to like LA then Iowa is in like
close to biggest and just like cool
places are there any cool places in Iowa
Margaret ass I mean there's the
Mississippi River I used to live in
Dubuque and that's right on the river
the river is cool Dayton Ohio yeah oh
yeah Wisconsin
yeah there's parts of Iowa that are
pretty cool I mean I don't know cuz once
you get up north there's a lot of like
Bluffs and hills and things like that
and then of course the Mississippi is
really cool but I don't know I just feel
like there's just not a ton there's just
that time to do here so I don't know
also if you still keep trying but I feel
like our time to move
like getting more limited and limited
the older and older we get I'm like come
on we're I'm not its own man's man we
gotta move but I don't think it'll ever
happen but that's okay I mean at least I
have like good friends here too you know
that helps but yeah okay so um that's
actually everything for this a PR hall

talking but that was everything I got in

talking to you guys I'm having such a
good time I'm having such a good time
here again comments South Australia I'd
love to visit Australia like RIT like I
really would I like going places too
that can like just teach me different
things like I've been to Amsterdam and
that was so fascinating to me just I
love when I'm like oh I just want to
keep going and YouTube was like no girl
Makiki Wow sorry guys I'm back game if I
lost anybody I should hopefully be back
but yeah answer damn was just a super
super cool just to see the culture and
the things like the food and I remember
that a lot of their restaurants like
where we were staying would close in the
middle of the day and like people would
go home and like be with a family or
like kick naps or something or whatever
it is what they do and then they come
back and open for dinner I'm like why
like it was just so interesting to learn
all these different things and even when
we went to st. Lucia for our honeymoon
we took like a boat ride into actually
like one of the towns and I sat there
and just like talked to all the little
boys that came up to like play tour
guide with us I just sat and talked to
them and asked like about their school
and what they do after school where they
live it's just so interesting like
that's what I love about traveling I
just like to learn about different
places I mean I love going to like st.
Lucia and I've been to the Bahamas just
to hang out on the beach and do that
that's super fun but if I can actually
like go in and see how like the actual
locals live
all right but that's the part that
fascinates me about it and that's why I
like traveling so much so it's just
interesting to learn but okay so our
thirty minutes now I should probably
stop talking so yeah that would be
really cool to go to Germany keep
talking please
I'm afraid YouTube's gonna kick me out
again let me know though on Twitter
because I always have like a Q&amp;amp;A in
there or I put like casual chitchat
where we can just kind of sit like this
and and talk I did a live get ready with
me on this past Saturday and just kind
of like just thought you guys wanted to
talk about I have a lot more fun doing
these lives I thought they would be I'm
not sure what I thought for sure that I
thought old live would be I was kind of
really hesitant but I actually I
seriously wish I could go live like
every single day it is so much fun South
Africa that would be amazing
Oh Finland yeah so you look at all these
fun places that we can go to but yeah so
let me know if you'd rather see like a
QA or just kind of a chit chat type of
video because I can always do those two
and then tomorrow's video will be a will
I buy it I'll talk about the desing KT
collab and then Thursday I'm really
excited for because it's gonna be my
back-to-school giveaway which I'm super
excited to do that because I had so much
fun shopping for it I have been to DC
