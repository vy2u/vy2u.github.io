little bit late I'm a Pakistan I was
turning the game on so I can watch it
while it's muted and the national anthem
was on and we don't this house in the
national anthem is on we said eppie
listen to the national anthem so sorry I
am a little bit late but I'm here I'm
here
how's it going hi hello hello hello
okay I'm here I need to find my chat so
I can look at the chat how do I do I
feel like every week every single week
I'm like how do I find my job I don't
know what to do okay
found it thank you in here so I can look
it up comments it's playing an ad before
my life hall really does it do that to
people
that's weird okay hello hello everybody
how's it going how was your Thursday
night going hello
okay we're here oh we're here
so yeah hi everybody how exciting uh so
today I did my Twitter poll like I
always do and PR Hall won again it's so
I feel like I said this every week to
that it's so funny to me how often
people want to see PR hauls especially
as wives but I like doing them live I
think it's more like I honestly think
it's more fun doing them alive versus
like a regular video so that's what
we're gonna do I just did one last week
so I mean I saw I saw up some boxes in
front of me but hopefully we won't be as
long as wait how long was last week no
last week was just an hour I think I'm
thinking of another time I went over an
hour so okay I'm just I'm all excited a
lot
I got Packer game on just pumped up Cubs
win the division last night it's like
like the best day you know okay Margaret
you were notified that my
I was on look at this day look at this
day well I didn't have like the best day
ever because I've very light makeup on
right now as my highlights like boom but
I did my makeup earlier to do a video
and I was like Gera you makeup soon well
I have so many people texting me about
the game already come on guys I'm live
I'm live guys stop texting me about the
game but I think my makeup and I was
like no no no no no no no that was no
good
I still filmed because it correlated to
the video that hey Kelly it correlated
to the video that I was doing so it was
okay but I immediately went and showered
so like my hair is kind of wild and
crazy and I I just like did very minimal
make-up today so hope you don't mind
so okay Myra says where's your dog she
is on the chair watching the game I feel
like I never know what to do for these
YouTube thumbnails because hey Katie I
never know what to do with these YouTube
thumbnails because you can't upload a
thumbnail when you're live at least if
you do live from your phone I think
maybe it's different if you do desktop
but if you do a live from your phone you
can't upload a thumbnail like you
normally would so you hop right before
you go live it says take a thumbnail
photo but it's it's with a front-facing
camera so I can't even hey Alex I can't
even like hold point-and-shoot at what
I'm wanting to take a photo of it has to
be selfie mode and that's like really
uncomfortable and I tried so many times
to get a picture of some of these boxes
and I was like just take a picture of
you in Aires and then arias was like no
photos please and I'm like just take a
photo
why why so there we go
Amy says does anyone else feel like
their day is incomplete if they don't
see Aires slap on the floor
it's Arawak yeah that completes my day
oh she's so funny she's so dramatic
okay so let's get started
ah all right I'll show this first
because I shared a photo of it on my
Instagram nice
Maria says arias is the most precious
dog ever oh I think they're okay so this
first box is from Maybelline which is so
exciting to me because Maybelline is
like my og brand you know it was the
brand that my mom you know always used
back when I was in high school so I was
using moms Mabley makeup when I first
you know started really getting into
makeup and even when I first started my
channel as always buying so much
Maybelline I was always buying so much
Maybelline and because I thought it was
really good but of course it was all so
horrible at the same time so amanda says
what's my highlight it is the Lancome a
sparkling fish speckling peach highlight
I've really been liking in those guys I
think I've worn in last week's tutorial
that I posted on Friday I really like it
but now I got a new highlight and I'm so
excited because I wanted to buy this
because so many people are talking about
it so this is the Maybelline master
chrome metallic highlight oh no I
thought I opened this the heck was I
drunk oh man
it is the Maybelline master chrome
highlight I could have swore I had this
open earlier did I just imagine that oh
oh oh so bummed I'm so bummed right now
not I did not come prepared enough to
come prepared well I got the highlight
and I'm very excited about it mm-hmm
Carol says when are you gonna update the
whole update which one which which one
then we know which one because I have a
follow-up video coming on I think Monday
what the last like when I was trying out
new makeup like the Fendi Foundation and
the next buyer palette and things like
that that one's coming very soon and
then Maybelline also sent a bunch of
these they're called the master precise
Inc metallic liquid liner I am so
nervous to try this so let's open it up
and see what
the whoa so here is what Wow what I mean
eat good at that then I see if I can do
some swatches hmm that one did not
swatch very well can you even see that
that did not swatch well it like hmm let
me try a different color
let me try different color that one I'm
going to like her what about this one
let's try this one okay maybe I need to
I need like shake it oh they're very
liquidy oh maybe you do have to shake it
there's like a shaky shaky shaky shaky
okay hold on let me try this one
they are okay I think you have to shake
them huh I think you have to shake them
cuz that's much better
oh well that's pretty okay yeah it
sounds like they have you know like nail
polish it that little like clicker thing
in there I think you have to shake them
so hmm okay trace is the verdict
what about this one because this one's
really pretty does their names oh this
is violet Nova okay so let me start to
open it shake it shake it shake it okay
let's see how this one looks like oh
that one's pretty still very liquidy
though like the first one was like super
liquidy
and not as much pigmented oh no that is
actually pretty cuz that's like I'm kind
of a muted violet okay I'll check and
see I'm so excited I just wonder if I'll
be any good at that applicator eyeliner
come on okay you know me okay so then I
also sent a bunch of different lipsticks
um we're talking about Maybelline my mom
just messaged me at loving the white
pants the back the Packers are in uh
their white uniforms apparently mom
likes it so they also sent me a bunch a
lipsticks and these are all they're from
their metallic line right yeah so
they're all metallic so I'm not sure how
many I'll keep for myself because I
don't do a lot of metallic
ooh that's pretty
okay so this one is in white gold this
might be like a good mmm that might be
like a good like lipstick topper if
needed I don't think I could pull it off
on its own but let's see okay so I want
to make sure I keep a separate pile when
i swatched and what I could put in C
would give away like oh I just pulled
out hot lava any funny noises no we're
hot lover today whoo okay there's hot
lava oh wow that's that's metallic yeah
that one isn't like metallic like
in-your-face metallic if it's a little
bit more like subtle hmm I actually did
wear a metallic lip in the video that I
filmed today though I was really since I
knew I was like outside of my comfort
zone and I was gonna go take a shower I
was like I was like well let's just do
something crazy do a metallic lip so I
did okay so maybe this one I don't know
that's kind of similar to the other one
let's see let's try to do something a
little different oh okay so this one is
called pure gold okay
ooh this could be you know a lot of
people are thinking like Halloween stuff
not that I feel like not you guys know
what I mean but sometimes when I see
like different things like this
what was the color swatch right before
hot lava
white gold wait gold so we have white
gold and then hot lava and then pure
gold is that right
pure yeah pure gold white gold hot lava
pure gold uh-huh
it's so funny though because like
everybody's getting so excited for
Halloween you know and everyone's like
what tutorials are you gonna do and I'm
like I don't know how to do anything
guys I don't like I don't know how to do
anything
I feel like Halloween is like the worst
time for me because I know everybody on
YouTube gets so excited for all these
like over-the-top amazing tutorials and
like some people make like full-on like
movies you know what I'm saying like
full-on movies but their Halloween looks
and I'm over
you're like I could do highlight this is
like ah
wanna watch me put false lashes Oh cuz
you know guys I'm not a makeup artist
I'm not I don't know I didn't I don't
know what didn't do uh last year I think
I did like a werewolf and I was so
uncomfortable like I was like sweating
the whole time I was like I'm not doing
those right I'm not doing this right but
you know what Alyssa says maybe you
could do a later back video recreating
Halloween tutorial I thought to do
something like that like trying to
recreate something like hey let's hang
out and like try to do this together
because it's it's really silly for me to
be like I'm going to teach you how to do
this what I'm doing I'm not good at God
I'm not good at the creativity stuff you
know like I follow I still to this day
there are so many times where I go to do
my makeup and I'm like oh someone had a
really nice tutorial I'm gonna go follow
that step by step like I'm just not you
know Oh someone says I agree with Alyssa
Alyssa would you say what do you say we
visit oh yeah
you have the laid-back fit yet Oh Missy
says yeah I finally caught a live view
well hello how are you um so yeah I
don't I don't know I don't know what
we're gonna do guys
but maybe I'll think of something
glamorous beetlejuice I'm not sure I'm
100% familiar with Beetlejuice I mean I
like I think I know
um like I think I know but me other says
can we do a different livestream next
time come to my Twitter and vote because
that's how I choose what to do for the
live stream is on twitter twitter vote
though sometimes if it is really close
on Twitter if I feel like I've gotten
more requests via snapchat I will do
that one but most the time I'm doing
what's requested on Twitter because
that's really those polls on Twitter
helped me out so much with what people
want to do or see
so that's them that's where I get it or
these um what am I trying to say that's
what I try to do these basically says
what's your zodiac sign you'd be cool to
see a funky look inspired by that I'm an
Aries me Margot says I got a Twitter
just to vote for your lives I love it
anyway says hi hello Vicki says you
should try minimalist liner with the
metallic liners yeah I like that idea
Heather says all like your dog yeah both
my husband and I are Aries can you see
me look I'm really short spinning um
okay let's see so do you guys want to
see let's see okay so I got another
package from Mac which was really so I
got another package from Mac wish it was
so exciting like where are they um it
but it was super cute because it came in
this case which i think is awesome
because i could totally use this case
like oh so cool and so I open it up and
inside there were choice we got two
brushes so this one is the 140s house
goes wait Dennis I just send you to
Mickey stuff yeah isn't that crazy like
I don't even know man oh here we go
- Joyce doesn't love to get makeup cases
me too like that's so helpful I would oh
my gosh I love like practical hopeful
things oh my gosh this is like really
okay well there's the price what the
heck it's like it's like taped and it's
like taped on there Carol says just what
you need more brushes all the time you
always always need more brushes and then
this one is the Mac 150 brush so this
looks like a foundation brush
ah as I offered white my face so I can
with those two brushes and then it came
with Vicks blood
yeah I love face plus and mine is like
getting down there and a little thing
about me because when i have something i
really like and i start to almost like
run out of it i stopped using it because
i don't want to run out of it I'm not
just talking makeup guys I'm talking
like cereal yeah I'll have like half a
bowl of cereal left and I'm like nope
not gonna eat that
not until I replace it not till I got my
backup cereal I'm not gonna eat that
last bowl cookies I'll have a cookie sit
there for a week what's wrong with me oh
who does that I'm like we're like grapes
I'll let the grapes continue to sit
there and the next thing you know I go
I'm like okay I really do want those
graves and I go to pull them out and
they've gone bad I'm like it's probably
that decision
but I'm really excited because this
means I could start using my well I've
always done that it's so weird and then
they also sent this the prep and prime
skin base okay so this is what this is
what that one looks like has the pump so
I'm really excited about this because
I've never tried it and they had a note
which did I lose the note I thought I
brought it out here maybe I'm crazy but
I had a note I'm talking all about the
skin fix BAM and stuff and I was like
cool I figured I'm into it you know we
got some fix plus because some brushes a
primer and then they sent a gift card I
was like what is so cool
what and I think it's for to go actually
buy like your correct foundation shade
of the skin fix I wish I had my note in
front of me the skin fix foundation so
I'm like cool
I don't go to the malls a lot but when I
go to the mall I'm gonna stop by Mac and
pick me up that foundation I thought
that was really cool I've never really
seen anything like that so
hey I'm like not that I would be mad if
they sent like you know all the shades
like all these other brands do I want to
be like oh no but it just makes much
more sense to just give card and go pick
on my right shade all's well in the
world I thought that was pretty cool
about bringing so I'm excited about that
so I'm gonna have to hit up the MAC
store and pick out my to find my right
shade of foundation and I'll pick it up
and give it a try you guys know what I
think so I thought I'm pretty cool yeah
oh there it is so it says that I don't
know if you do see it says fix fam
hashtag fix man yeah smart instead of
sending out a bunch I am NOT met like I
think that's pretty smart
not gonna lie because sometimes you get
things you're like oh like what I don't
know I can't I don't know if I'm just
more of like a practical thinker but
sometimes like you get things you're
like wow my goodness my goodness in my
office
oh yeah so I thought that was really
cool
I'm Gina says just about my first night
lipstick Prada classic and almost cried
out so happy that's awesome
yeah Beauty I think next door it's not
wastefully yeah you know I mean you know
because I've gotten some products where
I've got like multiple shades like
foundations or concealers and it is it's
nice to be able to pass it along or put
it in giveaways and things like that but
um you know for just letting people try
things out I'm all I'm all about that I
think that's really cool so let's see
Amy says what would you recommend my
first Mac purchase be I want all things
um and the fix+ was one of the very
first items that I ever bought from Mac
and I use it a lot I mean I use it to
spray my face before
oh the Packer scored a touchdown I'm so
sorry the clapping knock we're climbing
in the mill done so yeah I use the fix
plus you know I see the bag
here's the bank Thanks plus or I did buy
a pigment from them that was one of the
first things and I bought two but like I
don't know I don't feel like you would
really need that the skin the fixed plus
I use a lot or I have really been liking
their lipsticks velvet teddy right
velvet teddy is a really nice shade
interesting um but yeah some of their
lipsticks I think are really nice I've
been liking them Gina says do you prefer
fix+
or the Smashbox primer water I have both
I'm trying to think of like what I
grabbed out of my drawer first I think
that I I think I would have to say I
grab the fix+ and more I like the
Smashbox primer water but I think I
still use fix+ more
someone said velvet teddy is the perfect
shade for almost anyone yeah I think
it's really pretty I really do like that
shade my friend Brooke sent it to me and
I think that was the first time I tried
a matte lipstick and I was really
impressed I really did like it um but I
thought there was something else what
what was some of the other fix+ a
pigment oh they do have really nice lip
pencils if you do if you like lip
pencils they really do that was one of
my other first things were the lip liner
from Mac was like my first lip liner and
you guys like I can truly remember that
day and like being so proud I was like
this lip liner and whirl and everyone
talks about it and uses it now I got it
and whoo so if you like lip liners but
they do have some nice lip liners - so
okay so that is from Mac now I'll tell
you guys sorry
so today areas area stops dubs here is
does like MAC lipsticks
how is the tarte blush book working out
really good I will have a review on
either Sunday on Mondays video the
review of the tart baked blush book 3
will be in there I've been using a lot
more I think it's pretty good I'm pretty
happy what's again ok so my story of the
day
i'm sanna at my desk which has big
office in it her what sitting at my desk
in my office which has a big window in
it facing the street and I always get to
see when like the trucks are pulling up
because it like the FedEx and UPS comes
I'm like pick him souks even if like I
know that like I ordered like a book
from Amazon or something and it's coming
for me I'm still like it's here like I
get so excited and I see the FedEx truck
pull up and then you drop something off
and I'm like cool and I go and grab it
and it's a big envelope and I start like
I grabbed it like I'm gonna rip it open
and then I happened to glance at the
name and it does not say my name or my
address I'm like whoa that could have
been really awkward so I set it aside
because it was for a house just like
right up the street so I was like oh you
know I'll go walk it to him a little bit
later so a little bit later I'm like
well let's go ahead and get this done
with so I grabbed it areas and we walk
up the street I get to the house and I
walk up to the porch you know I'm like
oh there's another rock sitting there I
was like well they must not be home
because I was gonna ring the doorbell so
I was like I'll just send it next to the
box and as I said it next to the box I
look at the name just to like compare
like doesn't say the same name to you
it's that's my name and my address I'm
like what what what so the FedEx guy
clearly just swapped us and so I'm
standing there and I kind of like look
around because I'm like can I just take
this box this doesn't my name on it but
I feel like I'm stealing someone's mail
you know it's like it was like really
uncomfortable that's kind of like
looking around and I made a big show of
like looking at the envelope that I had
and like oh yeah oh this is the break
okay
put this down take this one like I felt
really uncomfortable I was like oh my
gosh it
Masami they're gonna call like the male
police on me and this girl just stole
package oh my gosh and then I get home
and I open it I'm like oh man if because
I almost opened I mean it was it was
like a terror envelope so not quite as
intense as having to like you know night
first Azhar open a a box so I might I
don't know but maybe if they wouldn't
have noticed they would have opened this
up and been like that's interesting
why did NARS send me a really large
package like what so when I opened it I
was like you know I like call my mom
right away I'm like can you believe the
next to this and all this stuff because
she's like what she goes not everyone
might not be as nice as you people might
just open your packages I'm like though
so mean but this is the NARS oh my phone
NARS man-ray collection I really I
opened it and like saw what it was and
then put it all back sounds like I'm
going live in just a few seconds or a
few seconds a few minutes a few hours
get it together girl so I wanted to save
it for that but this is the Man Ray for
NARS holiday 2017 collection it says
NARS cosmetics introduces the mannery
for NARS holiday 2017 collection
featuring a surprising surprising
limited-edition shades inspired by the
electrifying art of modern master modern
master at Man Ray
so it says an imagine of palette of
folds and brights evokes the artists
legendary wait while daringly
dimensional effects paint and ode to
originality express the unexpected that
was a little dramatic but okay so I'm
just I'm literally just writing like
picture my neighbor opening this big
like dough or this are like you like the
husband opening it and being like what
did you do like what I imagined okay so
there's a lot in here oh yeah I'm gonna
be honest I'm not familiar with me man
Michelle says Man Ray was an artist
there is some controversy
understand what's in here
so this is the first little box so oh I
think this is lipsticks this olives no
way oh my gosh Wow it's perishing Wow -
this is this is really really heavy
count looks interesting
oh wow okay so here is what is inside so
we have some these are audacious
lipsticks they just send me some oh my
gosh and they so these are like mini
sizes no way that is oh my gosh there's
so cool okay so there's four mini okay
where's that paper I threw I'm gonna
speed what does it say in here how much
this is maybe seconds by you guys oh
here we go oh here we go okay it's the
story thing I think this is $55 I think
I'm looking at the right thing oh my
gosh these are like like machines me
okay I tried a NARS audacious lipstick
I'm wearing one in my most recent will
mi a video it's kind of like a
cool-toned a grey purple type of thing
and I really liked it they were like
intensely pigmented and really creamy
and I like oh um but that is really I'm
woah that's really cool oh so we got
four mini lipsticks here
it's awesome okay let me my mom just
messaged me said the Bears are pitiful
tonight okay so that was that so then I
see like these pallets so let's see
these says this says debauched let's see
what's inside it up oh oh goodness let's
came up 2 2 2 2 protectors so this looks
to be a shadow cool okay the next one is
in yeah I'm gonna be somewhat able to
say any of these mantra para nice well
that one didn't have any protector at
all okay and then this next one is in
fetish fetishized fetish fetish dis hmm
you know all right book star living so
that looks to be a blush and then the
other one is intensely oh wow that is a
different shade maybe this finish to go
with or yeah someone yeah so we had some
eyeshadows and then blushes oh cool and
then this is the NARS a love triangle in
the shade is impassioned Ana I know it's
taped no no you don't know you don't I'm
gonna open you you're gonna like it

PR wise it's like I know a lot of people

palettes are like my jam these days okay
how much now I'm scared how much is this
morning
tell me tell me the build chic palette
$49 natus not as bad as I thought it was
gonna be now as far as the thought was
gonna be after for $2 I like okay let me
swatch this one Oh supersoft oh yeah oh
why did I splash like that oh look at
her Bluff
whoa then here's the bronzer and then
whoa Wow okay there's the highlight see
how should I do this
bronzer Wow that blush is really intense
okay so here is the bronzer and then the
blush and then the highlight wow that
blush I don't know if that blush will
look right on me I have to go go like
super super right-handed but okay so the
shades left to right um
Laguna Sun wash diffusing bronzer which
says it's a diffuse from powder with
golden shimmer and then the lovesick
blush which is a satin watermelon and
then the surreal highlighter which is a
glistening bronze rose and it does say
that the blush and the highlighter are
limited edition shades and then of
course Laguna is not limited edition so
whoa there we go so that is the veil
chic palette $49 available October 6 at
NARS boutiques and NARS cosmetics calm
okay and we're not even done now I'm
done I'm done
no sullen like you imagined it my
neighbor got this bag that she didn't
give it to me like she would be like she
would be so happy I mean if she likes
makeup actually I don't know who it is
so I know maybe she wouldn't like it at
all but then we have in here what are
you velvet eyeliner and velvet okay so -
I think I
I do love eyeliners I'm if a Pierre
keeps turning off
oh yeah oh there we go okay this is in
Santiago I believe there is one eyeliner
and then the other one oh this looks to
be like a purple this is in Nagoya
I think is what it's called those are at
the eyeliners and then we have or
looking like right these are lipsticks
right yeah not like comb crazy am i okay
so it says this is in muse and then this
next one is in keke um when the
collection releases I believe oh wait no
because they're all kind of different so
the veil cheek Pilate says October 6 but
then oh no I think it's October 6 well
most of them do say October 6 so October
6 is when I believe this will be
launching this one is in Zambezi Zambezi
and then this last one is in off limits
so look at my new sheet of paper huh I
feel so official I'm not used to this oh
here we go front page why not
this is the photo gloss lip lacquers and
these are $26 each so it says glisten up
saturated color steeped in superior high
shine for shades new limited edition
formula so there we go
okay I'm someone mentioned my nail color
it came in my September epsy box
it's from the brain I think it's called
a deci or a DC New York and I believe
the shade is in deception but I liked it
it was like a gray I thought that was
kind of funky like I don't have a lot of
like great nail polishes so there's 16
it was a different formula it took me a
second to get used to it but okay I
think this is the last item is this more
lipsticks
it says the kiss Velvet Matte lip pencil
set lip pencil it's cool
oh wait Caitlin says I'm wearing that
same color on my nails then toes you got
it in your hips you back too buddy
oh wow look at this fancy schmancy lip
purse yeah hi I'm from
oh wow even the zippers like fancy okay
so let's see in here we have okay so we
have some of these lip pencils I think
these were some of the very first items
that I tried from NARS or the lip
pencils cuz it came in like a Sephora
favorites collection okay so here are
you for lip pencils let me see if I can
find it on this sheet of paper here this
is like really handy they sent all of
this like with photos and I can easily
find everything except for if this is on
the last page okay then this is the kiss
Velvet Matte lip pencil set it's gonna
be $49 okay so you do buy it in the set
and says don't be a stranger
keep tabs on touch-ups with a rich
gradient of award-winning Velvet Matte
lip pencils featuring four new shades -
limited edition to existing so let's see
we have the shades wild ways it says
this one is limited edition and it is a
mahogany and then we have spellbound it
says this one is also limited edition
this is a shimmering pink beige like I
kind of want to put that on mine okay
and then this one is endangered red
which is the Bordeaux and then this last
one is tundra which is a rust so this is
what the
pencils look like and then so for the
set I mean I'm assuming I'm assuming you
get this too because it's showing it in
the photo it doesn't say it in the text
but it is showing it in the photo so I
think it would come with the bag and
then the four lip pencils and then
that's $49 this one says it'll be
available October 15th at Sephora so
there's that and then that's everything
in there oh my goodness gracious
well that was an act over with a feather
my whoa that's crazy
so so that is awesome um when I when
this video read uploads us the regular
video I'll go through and and type
everything out again with all the
different dates because yeah it's weird
like the NARS love triangles it's saying
available October 15th up Sephora say
same with that lip set that I just
showed
but then what was the other thing I was
talking about but then that first item
that I showed with the mini of who's
Lucia and booze booze mood oh my I'm
done the lipsticks available October 6
so it seems like there's kind of
different release dates for some the
veiled cheek palette October 6 so when
this reuploads I'll just go through and
type everything and there Michelle says
did I miss the hollow palette I don't
think I got I don't think I got that let
me see if there's a let me see if it
says it in here the hollow palate there
is the there's the glass tears eyeshadow
palette that's that's listed in here but
wasn't in my in my box does that way me
the glass tears eyeshadow felt will be
$49 available October 6 but other than
that I don't see anything else about how
it looks like there's a couple different
of these of the triangles
blush and lipstick it's like there's a
couple different colors there's orgasm
Dolce Vita and Audrey and passioned
Anna deep throat and Barbara so there's
that yeah I don't think I have the
holographic eyeshadow palette I don't
see it in the in the thingamajiggy here
so that's everything from NARS so
there's that
whoo my goodness that was really crazy
oh I was pretty cool man Oh red okay

daughter to bed let me stand by everyone
good night okay

but I got this sent from a pixie so
they're doing the take the glow tonic

glow tonic and Dora I thought that was
pretty neat but I have it and I actually

weird because I think everybody but I
thought that was really cool so you know

we're all it's done sorry I did not
realize that NARS lip package was gonna
be so huge so sorry about that guys were
at 45 minutes nobody be alarmed if
YouTube kicks me out because I'm
surprised they haven't yet um so I got
oh I got a package from a big sexy hair
oh the night where I have large hair
please send a bunch of different hair
sprays on my waters Oh crazy so who uses
big sexy here mm-hmm this is their
volumizing hairspray I teach her with
Ares on it that would be awesome
and then also the weightless hairspray
and then also the UV color protection
hairspray I probably this value is that
I'm actually and then also a teacher
with did I do a double take when I dude
that's the part someone I thought of
like a double take and then maybe like a
pair of highs you know I think that'd be
pretty cool this is the intense hold
here's breathe already and then also we
got the flash drive sickening hairspray
hmm I actually might want to try that
one hmm I'm sure that would actually
maybe says let's make this user thing
happen haha I would have no idea how to
go about it is I
money sometimes I think sometimes I say
things if I can speak and I'm like oh I
myself funny but I'm just a big nerd but
very cool I was very excited to get some
hair spray so thank you to big sexy hair
I appreciate it I got lots of different
things I can try out with my hair
because this girl always needs help with
her hair let me let me tell you I do
have one more thing since we have some
time though I did want to mention it
I've talked about it in a few different
areas but I would like to talk about it
here too since we have time because it's
something that I really really care
about
so Sigma came out with hey yeah Sigma
came out with their flat kabuki f80
brush this is like one of my holy corel
brushes I think I've gone through like
what I just declared what I think I have
like two or three more it's a really
good brush but they came out with a
limited edition pink one October is
Breast Cancer Awareness Month so they
are doing like a partnership with the
company bright pink and bright pink is
all about from what I understood I was
on their website for a few days checking
things out they're really into like
educating about like breast cancer and
ovarian cancer and just health wise and
you know early detection and how to test
and you know all these things and breast
cancer is something that has hit our
family so this is something that really
means a lot to me so I wanted to make
sure to talk to you guys about it but if
you purchase the brush from Sigma
I think it's 20% on the proceeds go to
bright pink and to help continue
education for girls and women so I think
that's really really cool
so I wanted to mention that so if you
guys want to it is our $25 for the brush
I believe but Sigma does have two year
warranties on their brushes and you guys
know I talked about Sigma a lot I really
think that they have like some of the
highest quality brushes out there that
I've tried so I wanted to mention that
if you're looking for a new foundation
brush maybe pick up this one codes
cannot be used on these
brushes because they want the full
amount to be able to be donated but you
can use anybody's codes on other
products so if there's anything else
that you've been eyeing from Sigma that
you want to pick up maybe pick it up and
then put this in your card as well
because it can be donated I am an
affiliate so I do have the code with
Sigma which is just Samantha I believe
it's for 10% off so if there's anything
else like maybe you've been waiting to
get it from Sigma you know you can still
get a large chunk of your order with the
20% off it's just not going to be
applied to this brush but you can do it
all at checkout if that makes sense but
I just thought that would be really
important so I wanted to to mention it
because I really the more I read about
bright pink the more I really liked the
sounds of it you know about education
and about the early detection I actually
did a speech about this in college about
about early detection about what you can
do to your health I'm gonna get upset
but I think it's really important so I
think it's really cool what they do so I
wanted to mention the Sigma pink f80 if
you are interested I'm trying to think
of some fun things to do in October for
breast cancer awareness a month you'll
probably see me use this brush quite a
bit you'll probably be seeing a lot of
pink um you know things like that
because I try to do my best every year
especially around October to bring
awareness and I think it's really
important so there's that my mom just
messaged me that now the game is in a
weather delay so I don't know what's
going on but yeah I wanted to mention
that so since we had some extra time I
know I've been talking about it a lot in
my other social media platforms but it's
something that I really like to get out
there so that's everything though guys
that is everything for this latest PR
haul I hope that you guys enjoyed seeing
it remember to let me know over on my
Twitter what you want to see for my next
live chat I'll be here next Thursday at
seven-thirty UCSD like normal um so you
can let me over there
let me over there let me know over there
what you want to see or if you have any
other ideas let me know because
sometimes I put PR Hall and like a QA or
a chitchat in there but sometimes I
struggle coming up with that third
option so I know someone mentioned
Fitness earlier so maybe I'll put
Fitness in for the next one and things
like that but if you ever have any ideas
for something to do for live chats
because you know they're just different
from doing a regular video so I kind of
would like to do some different topics
and things like that so if you guys ever
know I love seeing all these pink hearts
that's awesome so yeah just let me let
me know let a girl know um but I'm gonna
go and try to figure out what's going on
in this game and why there's a weather
delay and all this weirdness but thank
you guys so much for joining me for the
live I hope that you guys enjoyed seeing
it I am when this does a reapplied I'll
try it's at my best to link everything
and list everything and prices and or at
least dates and things down below thank
you guys so much if you're watching this
on the replay thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you guys tomorrow
