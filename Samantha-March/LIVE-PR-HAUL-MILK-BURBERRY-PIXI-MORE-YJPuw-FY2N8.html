well it is bright in here hi everybody
I'm doing another leg I'm going to be
doing a PR haul okay let's see I'm in a
different location I thought since I'm
doing them at night now
I thought typically I'm in my office
because that is where like I have good
lighting because I'm in front of my big
window but I know that it's gonna get
dark like I mean it's already starting
to get dark so I was like I can just
come out and do it in my kitchen and
because I'm doing a PR hall at all these
boxes in front of me and it's just
easier instead of like always I'm going
to reach down and stuff to get them
because I don't have a table in my
office and its really bright because
it's still light out and I'm kind of by
the door but I already have my ring
light set up and on because I figure
it's gonna get dark like any minute now
so hi everybody I need to find my own
livestream so I can be watching the
comments and turn the volume off and it
wants me to answer it wants what it
wants me to take my a survey on my own
thing I don't want to take a survey can
I skip this I'm not sure how arias is
gonna do she's right next to me and I'm
not sure how she's gonna do she doesn't
like it when I'm in different locations
she gets very confused and I apologize
for my appearance I filmed earlier today

my lipstick and I was gonna like try to
make myself look more presentable and
I'm like I'm tired it's 7:30 at night

normally I've been doing my lives at
Tuesday at 4:00 and then now I'm just
kind of changing up our schedule and

right in front of me um and this is from
pixie beauty pixie Beauty sent out like
the nicest packages ever hi from Iowa
City hello that is not too far from me
um oh you guys are saying it's better
now yeah so every once in a while I
don't know why it happens
oh but it kind of goes in and out but
people were asking if my internet is
back my internet is back but wow it has
been a week you guys with my internet my
internet went out last Tuesday at like 1
o'clock and my internet provider can
come till Friday then they came and then
said they couldn't actually fixed it
somebody else had to come so somebody
came when they even come Monday or
something I don't even remember but then
it gets crazier do you guys my hair the
story because I can tell you or I don't
have a cell you it's it's it's a story
it's a story um hello Midwest hello
hello
so pixie move it let's just know I'm
gonna get all riled up hi from
Connecticut hello Emily so so happy I
can make it to live soon are you guys
saying yes cuz you want to hear the
story so is everything yes - cuz I could
tell it I could I could try to tell as
fast as I can so what happened we're
getting a new service provider in our
area and I knew that there is there was
a there's a notice on our door saying
like hey we're gonna be doing work in
your yard and stuff you know let us know
if there's any problems that arise and
they kept working in the yard and it was
like every time they were here those
awful men in vests yes every time they
were here or in term it would be really
slow we kept having to like reset our
modem and stuff it sounds like every
time they're working you know they're
messing something up and then one day I
come out and they have a huge piece of
equipment in my yard and or literally
digging the hole and I'm like what are
they doing out there so then the day
that they dig a hole in my yard my
Internet's gone I can't get on my
internet so I'm like clearly they did
something right like I know that they
did something but I still I called my
internet provider and they were trying
to help me figure it out and then I
called that number because I kept that
card and so I called them and I was like
I think you did something and they're
like no and I'm like is something so
they sent out at one point there was
like how many guys were out there people
on my snapchat like seven dudes or
something all looking at this hole
trying to figure out like
and then they come in they're like no we
didn't do anything I'm like oh really
now you didn't do anything so finally my
internet provider comes out they can't
come out for four days and that's a
whole other whole other thing but they
finally come out on Friday and they're
like yeah the other person the other
person with the other company they cut
your cable line and they cut your main
line so the guys like I can't even fix
it like a whole different company has to
come out to fix it I'm like oh you
kidding me
so I called that first company and I was
like you've cut all my lines like what
are you doing
so they actually ended up coming over
and giving me their company hats box
they were like oh y'all sorry we messed
up I'm like you should just give me your
hotspot a week ago but then it gets even
crazier okay so I call another company
in the middle of all of this because I'm
like oh my gosh I have no faith that my
actual provider is gonna be able to come
fix it I don't know what to do so I call
another provider in our area and I just
am looking for a quote and you know how
soon can you come on - give me Internet
and they gave me a plug and that was
fine and but they were like but we can't
come out for like eight days or
something like that as a while and I was
like mm yeah that's not gonna work I was
like nevermind because my provider will
hopefully have it fixed by that time
that's too long to wait so then two days
ago I think it was my doorbell rings and
it's the Internet company that I called
for a quote and he's like oh your lines
are all set up and I'm like what do you
mean and he is like oh I'm with you know
so-and-so and got everything set up and
I'm like I called for a quote why are
you here why are you in my yard did you
just take away my internet did you just
take away my internet that I haven't had
for a whole week and the guy was like oh
um sorry about that I I didn't actually
do anything like I didn't I said
something about the lines is I kind of
touched the lines your internet should
still be fine I was a don't move and I
got on my phone to make sure that my
connections like my network was still
here or whatever and when it worked I
was like you can leave like what I
didn't authorize anyone to come
my house I didn't set up an account I
didn't do anything and then the next day
I get a modem in the mail UPS comes and
drops off a package is a freaking modem
for this company that all I did was
asked for a quote what I like this is
the most this like are you serious right
now it was the weirdest thing ever so I
had to go to UPS today to ship back this
fricking modem I yelled at it a nurse I
killed an innocent guy on my door who's
like I I don't I don't know what just
happened here I'm like you guys last
week was so stressful I didn't have
internet from Tuesday I like one o'clock
until Tuesday probably like one o'clock
so yeah there was that yeah someone says
500 bucks that if they don't get their
motor back if that's what you mean I
went to UPS today to drop off the modem
that I don't know why they sent to me
and he was like do you want a receipt
and I was like no that's okay and he
looks at the box and he goes OH
CenturyLink no I'm gonna give you a
receipt because they tell people they
always tell people their packages got
lost and then they charge them I'm like
excuse me I was like okay give me a
receipt I'm like I don't even I didn't
even make an account I don't even know
why they speak why would you send
someone to my house without me having an
account without me paying for anything
and pay for you you guys it was so weird
it was so weird I'm so sorry ten minutes
of us is me telling that story but it
was just the weirdest situation it was
just weird so okay that was my internet
story but it's back very strange still
ongoing but very strange like I don't
even know anyways Pixies 660 beauties in
a package hello man it has been a week
you guys when I was camping in the
middle of all this and Camping's

for this package that they sent because
it came with the double cleanse and this
was a collab that they did with Carolyn
herranz
and I love this yes Emily says that so
scared of random guys show up yes that
actually actually really freaked me out
like you can't just send someone to my
house to work in my yard without me
saying yes I called for a quote
obviously I had to give my address
because you know obviously you have to
give her address that I'm like no no
account was made you can't just do that
you can't just how do you just send
someone something in the mail without
them even like I didn't put a credit
card down or you know any sort of
payment I asked for a quote that company
is shady
CenturyLink I'm saying their name I was
trying not to say that it Centrelink
they Shady
they Shady cuz I don't know if now
they're gonna try to get me like oh you
didn't return the boat
I don't want your motive I didn't ask
for your modem I didn't pay for your
modem nothing but I'm super excited
because I love the double cleanse and I
was getting really low on it so now I
have another one I'm so happy so one
side is a cleansing oil to like take off
your makeup and then the other side is
like a cleansing cream like a regular
cleanser it is so good like one of my
favorites so I was I opened it up I was
like no and then the other thing they
sent is their lo tonic Cory says they're
all shady seriously all of them all of

I just want to cry every day to work
solely from home on the Internet
I did not have internet is was so
frustrating so I was trying to like make
light of the situation
like have fun with it for a while and
then I got to a point I was like this

really well
Stephanie says will you be doing an
altar 21 days of beauty video yes I just
filmed it today and I think it's

other thing they send is the eyeshadow

with its Judy time again they did send
this to me as well so so I just I have a
lot of great stuff for giveaway so
that's friggin awesome because I'm
totally putting together the 30
okay which is still really wild for me
to say but yeah we got a couple of new
things from pixie that I can put in
secular way that I'm really excited
about so that is what pixie Beauty sent
over yeah I know a lot of people are
saying they aren't I'm super impressed
with the 21 days of beauty I know um but
it make sure I feel like when I was
going through the catalog that they sent
I feel like not everything was in there
if you go to like ulta.com slash 21 days
of beauty or whatever it is I feel like
they had more listed on there and and
still like not everything was you know
there wasn't there was only one item
that made me dance
just one what's usually there's a couple
more but you know yeah that's what it is
I still found a few good things to point
out or recommend or you know that I got
my eye on and and stuff like that so
let's see let's see what are people
saying now there's some really good hot
buys make sure to check out the Hot Buys
- I do talk about them in the video but
they got a couple good hot bias so yeah
I'm Katherine says I'm into the dose of
color slippy is the Oprah highlights and
it cosmetics brow products yes yes
Ashley says the only thing I really want
is the naked flesh palette I did I feel
like that one for me to the hot buyers
hop eyes are so they have like the deals
for each day but the hop eyes are up
there the entire time
they usually aren't like the 50% off
like the beauty steals are but they're
still like 20 - like 40% off and you can
get them any of the days but they do
sell out so you just gotta get them if
there's them if you if there's something
you want cuz they can sell out I do want
to talk about this because I I feel like
this is really cool and I was really
excited to get another package from them
this is the company called still box and
I have had their shampoo and conditioner
for a while now and I really do like it
I've used it myself I continue to use it
on my hair quite a bit but they sent me
another package but I really like this
company because they're all about like
giving back and I feel like a lot of us
are really it's like a giving back
spirit right
with everything that's going on with
Harvey and I feel like I'm gonna cry if
I talk about it because I was just
talking about it with my husband and
it's getting all worked up and getting
all upset but I just feel like a lot of
us are you know maybe kind of in like a
giving back mood and things like that
and so that's what this this company is
are really good for and for everything
that you buy they donate to someone here
in the US and then someone overseas as
well and I think that's really cool so I
definitely wanted to make sure I've been
holding on to these for a while now but
I wanted to to mention them in a video
sometimes so they sent me a shampoo and
conditioner and they also sent me a body
wash and then a liquid hand soap and
things it's um what was I gonna say I
lost my train of thought sorry but yes
so for everything thought you buy they
then donate which i think is really cool
they did give me a discount code and
it's not like a like I don't make money
off of it it's just a code if anybody's
interested it's March soap box and it's
20% off when this video does reupload as
a regular video i'll have it linked in
the description box below too but again
it's just March soap box if you're
interested and it's really cool because
on the back of like every bottle there's
what's called a hope code I don't know
if you guys would be able to see it but
like the hope code is right here and you
can actually go to their website and
type it in and it'll tell you like where
the donations for each of those codes
like where they are donating to and
there's like a big map and it tells you
I think that's really cool so I
definitely wanted to mention that again
like I just hopefully were feeling you
know in that giving back mode if we can
whether it's like money or supplies or
even just sharing like I'm trying to do
my best to keep sharing about any like
places or or things like that and
there's just a lot of crazy crazy things
for the Harvey that's just so sad I was
talking to my friend earlier today about
like the pets and you know the pets that
are being left behind the dog I'm
but geez it just it's so sad but I did I
wanted to mention that for sure and
again it's called soapbox its soapbox
soaps if you google it soapbox soaps so
there is that um oh thank you
thank you so much Heather says Mac
velvet Canyon will be on sale for nine
dollars is a live sex are gonna be on
sale that's really cool let me get up to
see where I kind of missed out on the
comments okay let's see yeah a lot of
you are saying you're not to to
understand the twenty days of beauty I
totally get it
sassy life story an arse pellet is on
sale yeah it's one of their cheap palace
I'm pretty sure I'm saying that
correctly
oh yeah Katie says yes if you're
applying to remember yes yes that's
correct
let's see dose of colors did you like
the eye shadow I did I did I liked it um
there's like third or if you're talking
about the one that I'm wearing the first
is like a regular eye shadow like not
like regular it's almost kind of like
sticky I don't know what you would call
it but I put that down first as a base
and then there's almost like a pigment
that you put on top the pigment was a
little hard to work with because it's
like one of those sifters that I feel
like I like turned upside down and Shake
for like 10 years and like this much
comes out I'm like a little bit more
than that
but that was the only hard part but I
thought the color turned out really well
so let's see Oh life's turned up since I
love soap box products very cool okay
Brittany says that company is really
great awesome
services are you gonna talk about the
two-faced candy Johnson collection I
actually I'm pretty sure I put it in a
will I buy it like back when we first
heard about it what you know was
probably like 16 months ago or something
but I'm not gonna purchase anything from
it so let's see Heather says are you
excited for fall yeah I like summer so I
always get sad but falls better than
winter that's for sure so I do I like
fall
I like thought I liked it cuz football

later on my phone over um yeah I do like
football a lot we're trying so hard to
get to a Green Bay game I don't I don't
know it's gonna work but uh we're hoping
to we're hoping to the sometimes it's
really crappy liking a good team
cuz the tickets oh it's so expensive
jeez um life startups that are you guys
gonna do a fall bucket list we are I
think we're gonna do a fall / winter
bucket list because our summer bucket
list went over so well
yes Packers are playing right now I have
the Cubs game and I'm flipping back and
forth from the Packers game it's on
silent though it's on it's on silent I
just got to check out and see what's
going on let's see oh we got Steelers I
got Seahawks y'all I love about season
okay so next up we got oh go Viking Oh
my best friend is Vikings fan okay so I
got another package from motor brushes
that was gonna follow my head I got
another paramotor brushes and I actually
just got a package from them not too
long ago with their metallic line and so
then I got this box and I was like oh no
they sent me a whole other box like I
thought they said the same but it's
different but that was like oh how'd
that happen I don't know why my first
thought was oh no but it really was but
I was like oh no like someone made a
mistake
but they're it's different it's
different so this is the Mota prismatic
so this is the first set that they sent
along so it has three different brushes
and then looks like a little case right
here I am posting a makeup brush to
clutter tomorrow and smooth at struggle
the struggle was real you guys
most like embarrass to post that video
but I I gave it I gave it my best shot
so I'm not going to open anything right
now just as I'm not sure but I'll keep
and what I'll put in the giveaway
because my love for make impressions was
so real but then this is another set
this one looks to be like mostly eye
brushes I really do like the motor
brushes my friend Mickey sent me
actually this one first it's the
prismatic foundation brush she sent me a
set had this and then three or four
other brushes and I did keep two of them
from the set because I really do like
them including this foundation brush but
because I do have this exact same brush
I probably will put this one in my 30k
giveaway too which is so exciting like I
I hope that giveaways like prom I'm and
this is the contour brush I think this
is one I think I actually did declutter
this one cuz it was a little big for me
but no I don't know if that's the right
I don't know if I did I'll have to check
that out but that's the other one that
they said but they also just recently
sent their metallic brushes and I've
been trying some of them and I've been
really really impressed I motor brushes
are really nice if you guys been
watching my channel you know that I
probably you know I talked about Sigma
and morphe a lot Real Techniques I have
quite a bit of them too but motor
brushes was really really impressing me
so I was super excited to get another
package from them especially with a
couple of the duplicates in there so
that's pretty cool okay
yes saying what yes what are you
guessing sorry I feel like I'm being
really close to the camera or do I do
that
oh let's see mm-hmm so I'm just gonna
read some comments Katie says I need to
do a brush to cut her but I don't wanna
I like put all of my brushes down and I
was like how did it get this
I don't know I knew it was getting out
of control but I didn't know it looked
for it God
um let's see huh it just jumped no I
lost him
Oh No okay okay okay so let's see I have
some more getting care I was so excited
about this so this I feel like is
definitely a company that not a lot of
people like I don't know if I've ever
heard anybody else talk about them but
if you go back like even last year and
you watch like skincare favorites I'm
talking about them it's the brain called
Sully Klee I think it's how you say it
so this is what what their packaging
looks like and they sent me a package
you know at least a year ago if not more
and I just fell in love with their
skincare products they work so well with
my skin I'm always giving them like
talking about them like rave reviews
because I just I enjoyed them so much
and I thought it was so nice the other
day they said oh we watched your most
recent skincare video and we noticed you
said that I was out of one of their
products and they're like we'll send you
more I was like like any you watch my
video like I didn't tag um I didn't do
anything I don't I don't even know how I
found my video I did I didn't I don't
know maybe they you know maybe they a
little on YouTube Google for their
company name or something I don't know
but they're like oh we watched your
video and you know you said you were out
of this so we wanted to send you some
more I was like what nice thanks and so
they sent me there to taxi smooth mild
foaming gel cleanser this is one of my
favorite favorite cleansers and I was so
sad when I was out I had a while there
where I was trying different skincare
brands and I felt like none of them were
working for me and all of them are doing
terrible things in my skin and each time
that I would break out really badly I
would be going back to this and then my
skin would clear up and look great again
so like I have a lot of these products
but this is what I was almost out of the
Lummi bright sea and so this is what
they saw in the video that I was like
I'm so sad I'm
almost out of that cuz it has vitamins C
which I love vitamin C is like my
favorite thing ever it says it's for sun
damage discoloration and firmness and
then they also sent their multi glue a
their Ultra corruption night treatment
it has retinol bio retinol and
niacinamide I think is how you say it so
that's just like having in a jar and
then I'm sitting on my feet feet are
falling asleep and then the seer lipid
luxe who this isn't new went to me
retexturizing and nourishing open it and
was so happy to make it to alive hello
hello okay so that's what that's the
other thing that they sent me so I was
really excited about that the sometimes
I feel bad like talking about them so
much and and recommending them because
they are pretty pricey I should ask them
I should just reach out and ask them if
they would like consider doing like
giving me like a good discount code or
something like not Mac for me but just
like for for anybody to use because I
really want people to try this brand
because I think it's so good and
seriously if I were to open my skincare
drawer and show you you would see just
like bottles upon bottles upon bottles
of the Sully clay so I think they're
really good and that was just like that
really was so cool and they said they
saw my video and saw that I was out I
was like thank you
so maybe I'm gonna write that down so I
can do that let's see let's see let's
see Margaret says what do you think of
the new who duck I shove a pellet I
think I talked about it in my latest
Vilia by a video but I'm gonna pass over
it just I don't know I just I feel like
I heard too many conflicting things
about her first one this is random but
are the desi our channels worth of $30 I
was originally super hyped now I'm on
the fence only if only if you're either
a super fan like me or if you're okay
using your fingers and having to get a
shadows wet like they are definitely not
the easiest to work with and I'm still
working with mine I still want to get
better thoughts put together before
every suck happen so I can give a review
but we're okay there it's so far so far
so I want to say so far so far they're
okay they're just they're really hard to
work with Carol says did you decide on
the blog sale yeah I was talking on my
snapchat the other night that um sorry I
was writing my snapchat the other night
that I'm trying to be better at doing
you know some declutter Xand stuff and
I've seen a lot of or just you know a
couple of bloggers doing blog sales and
so selling items that like I myself have
purchased and either didn't work for me
and I couldn't return or you know I just
don't really reach for him anymore and
every single person on my snapchat says
that they would like to see a blog sale
so I'm gonna be putting it together I
took some photos last night of some
lipsticks that I declared and then I'm
gonna wash the brushes that I declared
from this week and then I have another
declutter video that I'll put up and
then after that I will do a blog sale so
yeah and it would just be for stuff that
like I bought for myself I would never
put like PR you know blog sale cuz
that's just like really I don't I mean I
don't think anybody does that I I don't
know um but that would just be really
weird to me so no that would be weird so
it's product that I bought and either
you know I couldn't return it didn't
work for me I didn't like the color you
know things like that so that's what I'm
gonna work on and hopefully in the next
coming weeks here I could do like a blog
sale so that would be that would be fun
I think make all this expensive so when
it doesn't work for you like honestly
some of these things from the desi Katy
Club are not really working for me and
I'm like I don't know if you can really
return those and I'd like to I feel so
bad returning them because I like them
so much but like everybody was on me
about my lipstick in the other video
like grab that lipstick did not look
good I'm like okay rule oh let's see
also a lot of you are feeling you
feeling the blog still that's cool yes
yes so okay like I said that you want
I'll remember out out email them and ask
if they'd be interested in doing that
anna says that Smith is the reason my
bank account is so low
Oh Cassie those like oh you did return
it you can his wondering if you could
return or not or no so okay cool some
more skincare I got a new mass from
pathology this is their milk
peel exfoliant I have never tried this I
think this is a new product so I'm
really excited for that so that's pretty
cool this is what it looks like so I
just got this one in the mail so see if
I can open it okay whew so this is what
they look like so I'll be trying this
very soon so yeah I love pachala gmasks
eyes I mean I use some sort of tetralogy
product like I don't know three times a
week maybe I'm just I'm like very I'm
very loyal to you at this moment so I
was really excited when I got this
Alison says I found a pathology mask
kaduk t.j.maxx hey that's awesome
amber says can someone tell me how a
blog still works basically I would just
you know find items that I would
declutter and then I'll just put a for
sale on my blog and like a list of price
and then it looks like how most people
are doing it is they they just have
people email so like if you wanted to
buy something you'd email me and as long
as we agree I would send an invoice you
pay for it I ship it out that kind of
thing
I think um I want to I want to look at a
couple more people's before it actually
like fully put mine together just to
make sure I'm doing it right and
everything but that's mostly how I've
seen it usually there's like a flat
shipping rate but I think one thing that
I want to do is I saw some people say
like if you buy over like $75 like the
shipping is free but I want to do
something like if you buy over like $50
I go put a free gift in there you know
because you know I get some really cool
PR and I can't use it on myself and you
know I just keep putting things and
giveaways and putting
it was but I thought maybe that could be
kind of cool I don't know like spend
this much money I'll give you a forget
you guys can tell me what you think of
that idea if you think it's dumb okay
I'm gonna grab a few more things okay I
just thought that'd give you something a
little funny so uh let's see I oh ouch
sorry I was sitting on my legs okay so I
was really excited to see this because
it is from I'm like oh man and they did
send me a package before and I have
three of their velvet lipsticks in it
and I nearly like lost my ish but then I
got this big box and then I got another
box and I was like I don't think this is
for me I don't think this is for me
Thanks I was so excited and I've been
waiting to play with it to see if you
guys wanted to see the pr haul if that's
what won the Twitter vote and it did so
I was like okay keep it all like in the
blank fancy packaging so you can show
everybody but this is what the first
little box looks like and then inside is
this little lipstick and this is in
russet is the shade so it looks like a
beautiful fall color like so like so
overwhelming okay and then what am I
doing this this is called this is an eye
color and antique blue literally my
hands are shaking I'm like I've had this
for maybe like a week now but I'm still
ago or no idea I can't believe so that
is an eyeshadow it says you can use it
wet or dry and then they sent this is
their mascara it just says jet black and
then the last one in this little set
here see if I can give it out without
making a mess oh my goodness okay this
one was the nail polish and black cherry

you know Burberry had nail polish hey
yeah like Oh like I'm keeping all of
these boxes like look at this look like

then the next one this is sure this is
what's in there and I mean man I mean
where do you leave it boy dirt okay
oh man I should have tried to get stuff
out before I came in
okay so we have these three here so this
is a face contour oh oh no look it was

is that that one looks like whew there I
don't know can you guys see that very
well

highlight stick and then this one is the
lip color contour in medium so that is
what that one looks like and then woo

oh but I see why it was probably messed
up because that's as far as it goes down
so hmm I get it but this one oh yeah
okay so this is called and it's so
pretty I had to open and already this is
they're fresh
highlighter in rose gold like come on
how do you even how do you even put a
brush in that how do you how do you
swatch that it's so gorgeous
are you kidding me I don't even know
what to do I don't want to touch it I
don't want I I don't even wanna I don't
know what to do about this you guys
watch this is like this was I think the
first thing that I opened I was like oh
I just have to see it I just have to see
it and I open it I was like you oh my
god okay hey the whole body in that's
hard to do
oh it's hard to do okay oh oh that's
really pretty
okay that's really pretty oh now I don't
feel an ironing feels bad oh-ho-ho
that's really pretty
like so many different fields so many so
many different feels I can't get this
last one out though oh shoot what do we
do oh man you guys oh man
that was that was cool I remember I
actually got this box like one of the
days of my whole internet situation well
I can't get this out but this is their
fresh glow luminous fluid base in nude
radiances no this thing that's been
there I cannot get it out for the life
of me so sorry about that um yeah I came
one of the days that that I was feeling
really down and out about the internet
situation and this box came and I was
like life is not that bad put a smile on
your face what you're gonna get your
internet back and it's gonna be great
but oh my god Burberry just sent you up
so many items that you know it's just
gosh it just it just was really really
cool really overwhelming really cool so
I'm gonna come in and read your guys's
comments bow down to the highlight
seriously like wow so this oh man
as a collector item yes I I can't get
rid of that for it nothing like nothing
you can't you can't take it yeah they'd
get it let's see well yeah I don't know
if I want to know the price tag of the
highlighter though like I don't know
about $68 oh man but it's it's really
pretty like like that just overwhelming
even boarded my face just you read my
face just get read so I'm like wow $60
highlighter now take care of it can I
put insurance on the highlighter
let that work hmm okay this just came
today so I didn't even have a chance to
play with it yet but I got a box from no
makeup they have they've sent me a
couple things in the past I don't get
everything from the but whatever I do
I'm like what so they sent some lip
colors and I did take a peek it came
like right before my husband came home
so I really didn't get to play with them
but they sent some lip colors which is
awesome so these say let's see stand out
color in one flick swipe go bold with
our signature creamy Demi matte lip
color it's packed with 30% pigment load
versus the average of 8 to 10% I did not
know that to deliver full coverage and
intense payoff in a sweat nourishing
ingredients like shea butter coconut oil
and great food grapefruit peel oil
softened lips and boost of moisture it's
paraben free cruelty free begin so this
is the one that I wait is that the one I
meant to pull out this is called low key
so this is what the packaging looks like
see I really like milk because I feel
like they're just like different you
know like our products look different I
don't know I'm just kind of into that so
this is what what do I say what was
called low key see how I do this I just
twist it oh okay looks like whew that's
really pretty oh I'm so bad at swatching
okay so that is low key mmm should I put
this one on it or here I think there's
like a nude maybe that'll look better
yeah I can put some on my lips I don't
have a lipstick on her so I can let's
see I think I thought I saw like a maybe
this one
cream well they're so sticky okay this
one is called well it's spelled CRE a.m.
but there's periods in between each so
I'm not sure if that's supposed to stand
for something but I don't have a mirror
hmm this feels nice hmm what do I look
am I in the lines at all I'm pretty far
from my phone so hopefully hopefully
that could no kidding I don't really
feel like I'm getting the one swipe but
I think the colorful a pretty hmm what
do you guys think oh it is Matt right I
wish I had a mirror it does like Matt on
my lips doesn't it actually pretty it
feels it feels really comfortable it
doesn't really have a scent to it
mmm I like that one so that one is cream
from milk the one that i swatched is a
little bit more mob
I'm actually really I'm actually really
digging this so far guys hmm thank you
for making me put that my lips that was
a good idea normally I have lipstick on
but I'm such a hot mess I didn't but
that's right I really like the finish of
that one so what are these calls again
these are called do they have a name it
just says milk makeup lip color hmm okay
that's all it says I don't know they
didn't with me any other information
like prices or is it on sale
there's no they literally they didn't
leave any other information okay
Brittany says $22 I'm not mad right now
I mean I don't know like how long
wearing it is and how well it keeps up
but so far I thought that looks really
pretty so I do I love mops too I didn't
know if I would go with my green look
but hey that I'm pretty excited about
um we are almost done I promise how cool
were at 48 minutes oh sorry sorry
oh I got I did get a new um what would I
call this hair wand send to me it's not
a curler because it doesn't have like
the clip the you know you know what I'm
saying it's just a wand
it's from GHD it's called the GHD wave I
think and I've tried about a couple
times so far and I actually really do
enjoy it because that actually waves my
hair versus curling it and I like waves
versus curls but when I use a curling
iron I'm trying to do waves not curls
and like sometimes it turns out okay and
sometimes I'm like not so good
so with this I've actually been really
liking it because it's just a wad and
it's really like it's kind of like wired
so it's easy to wrap my hair around but
I was really excited to get this guy cuz
I don't have anything like it so I
thought that was really cool I am doing
a hair tutorial on Saturday I I gave it
my best shot
to do a hair tutorial like
back-to-school ideas and oh man you guys
it's not good I'm not obviously like I'm
not good at doing hair but so many
people requested a hair tutorial that I
was like okay I have to do it so I did
and it's not great isn't that great you
guys what I tried did I mention it's not
great I mean I've never had any sort of
skills when it comes to hair no not ever
no skills so that was really challenging
I had 10 hairstyles and I think we're
gonna end up I think maybe there's five
in the video bye bye good job Sam like I
just can't like I just I just I just
couldn't do it
okay we are at 58 minutes so I'm gonna
try to hurry I just have a couple more
things left but this was really exciting
to me too because I got a package from
mac cosmetics which I thought was
amazing this is part of their Viva Glam
so it says since then
1894 every cent from the selling price
of Viva Glam lipstick and a lip glass
has gone toward helping women men and
children living and affected by HIV and
AIDS and this is a collaboration with
taraji P Henson
listen I think I'm playing him correctly
actress so they sent me a lip glass and
then the frost lipstick which I thought
was very cool so let's see trying to
hurry oh my goodness look at this
packaging Mac is another one that I
still can't like any time I've gotten
something from Mac I'm like pretty sure
my next-door neighbor does YouTube too
and you meant to give it to her because
I can't be right
so this is what that looks like and it
says that the frost lipstick so I know
that I I know that I personally wouldn't
wear this shade so I don't want to
swatch it because I can't include this
in a giveaway so I wouldn't want to
swatch it just because I just know that
that's not the type of you know lipstick
that I wear so let's see and then the
lip glass I've been trying more of the
Mac lip glasses lately and I actually
really do like them I keep using one in
particular candy box it's literally on
my desk at all times oh my goodness this
is pretty Wow
okay so this is
okay so that's that looks like oh that
is really pretty
hmm I'm kind of like hmm but ah
sometimes sometimes I just want to like
keep I like I want to keep things for
myself but I'm like if I know that I'm
not gonna get a lot of uses out of them
I'm like oh god you know oh that's
really pretty though but that was really
cool I actually didn't know I feel like
Mac is always doing like collaborations
and they always have so much going on so
I actually I didn't even know about this
until until I got it but I thought that
was really cool and I also didn't know
about the Viva Glam and what they do for
donation wise for that so I did not know
that so I learned that and I thought
that was really very cool so the last
thing that I will end on is just a few
items that I got from octa Lee so this
isn't really PR because I'm not just
getting it sent to me like for you know
no reason that these these actually I do
have to review in a certain amount of
time actually connects brands and
bloggers and you can apply to get
products and brands can either say yes
or no to you and I was really excited
cuz I got two items from urban decay and
two items from Lancome like I was like
for sure they are saying no to me and
they said yes I was like no way so some
of the items that I got from Urban
Decay's they're all nighter liquid
foundation I wanted to try this for so
long I've always just been a little bit
scared because I hear it's really
full-coverage so I was always kind of
like oh do I do it do i doing that do it
I almost bought it during one of the UM
the Ivy Rouge sales there were says did
you give up organizer your makeup yeah
yeah I mean I need another piece of
furniture in there I need like a death
or a vanity or a table or something
because everything just gets piled on my
floor and it's so overwhelming so this
is what this one looks like I'm so
excited I would forget I'm nykeya in our
area we don't have an IQ that round here
what is the bummer but I was thinking
about maybe just doing like we
like this little table in our living
room and it has just like six little
drawers in it and like three of them we
have like little boxes baskets in them
or whatever and then we just have like
photos and stuff and the other ones I
think maybe even something like that
like I just need I just need something
but then I also really do want to
repaint my office so I don't know
someday we're gonna get it all figured
out someday we're gonna figure it out
but they also sent me the eyeshadow
primer potion I hear so many people
talking about this and I'm pretty sure
my friend Olivia from live gloves or
makeup just told me today that she's
been hurt just told me she I mean she
was on her snapchat but I thought she
said this is the one that she's been
using I got ton lately so that really
excites me so there is what that one
looks like I was so excited to get those
two items Vicky says what color would
you paint it Oh live loss the anti-aging
one you're right I think this this just
says original I just thought I would
I've always wanted to paint it just like
a light gray or I like right it was one
of our wedding colors but like a light
gray is really all I just never kind of
understood the red office because when
we moved into this house it was red like
I didn't paint it but when we moved in I
could tell you know doing that they'll
walk through and stuff like looking at
the first time that was I think it was
the guys office who lived in this house
and I'm like why have a red office
that's so dark when you want your office
to be like light but like I don't know
it just that kind of always confused me
so I really have always wanted to paint
my office like since we've been here for
four years and it's always been on our
list but we're finishing our basement
right now and it's just kind of a really
big project to have to take everything
out especially because I have so many
boxes and just piles on the floor and
stuff so it's like oh man like the
thought of taking everything out is like
oh it's like exhausting but we're going
to get very good one of these days and
then I got these two items from Lancome
so one is the tent idole ultra make-up
stick I was like I'm so sad though
because I just have been trying the
Lancome ten seed oil
little foundation like a regular one and
I've been really liking it and now they
also make a stick foundation jobs like
mmm I kind of want to test him out like
hit him against each other type of thing
I thought that was really cool but I
can't get it out so who got it
ooh okay so that's what that looks like
so I'm excited I'm just oh oh it would
that may be mmm that might be a little
dark that is what that one looks like so
I'm excited to give that a shot and then
the other thing is the highlighter I'm
gonna highlight no bye but I really
wanted to do one of these it's the dual
finish highlighter in sparkling pÃªche a
sparkling not I'm not fancy enough to
know Jose with that word okay
so yeah mini says I'd invite you no I
didn't I didn't feel as bad I didn't
feel quite as bad but I just I they did
catch my attention but I was trying so
hard to talk myself out of them like no
you don't need them you don't need them
you're not highlight no buy and then
when I saw it on oculi I was like please
please please please
okay oh my gosh can you this is my light
too bright I feel like I feel like my
ring light is like washing it out
completely okay that's okay
nice sergeant I'm Sachi oh I'm like
running out of oh there it is right
there
hmm that is really pretty
that's definitely very gold hopefully
that'll look okay on me touch I thought
yeah I thought it was peachy um that's
very gold hopefully it'll look okay on
me
that is pretty it is this one right here
so so excited huge thank you to Lancome
and actually in Urban Decay I feel like
I got some really good stuff and they
all came on the same day it was like
Christmas for sure so that was very cool
but after that that is everything I'm
sorry we took up the entire hour I'm so
sorry so sorry that was so long but that
was so fun to show you guys everything
that I got thank you everybody for
chatting with me let's see let's see
let's see whatever people say oh yeah
you guys are giving me some pain ideas
yeah hopefully hopefully one of these
days we can paint it cuz that would be
fun
it's always it's sometimes it just is
really frustrating to read a comment
like you really need to paint your
office I'm like then you come over here
pay my office that's a lot harder to do
it than just being like I'm just gonna
pay my off like I'm just gonna wake up
and decide to paint it like no it's it's
it's a lot especially when I'm in my
office all day every day it's so you
know it's not like a room that we don't
use a lot type of thing so it just it'd
be really hard but we'll get there I'll
do it I'll get there so um thank you
