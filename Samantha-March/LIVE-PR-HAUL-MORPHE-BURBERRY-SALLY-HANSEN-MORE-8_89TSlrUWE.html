feel like I'm very centers I mean like
scoot over a little bit okay hmm
we might just not be centered doesn't
look like I'm wearing a shirt I am okay
hi guys I am so excited to be doing
another live I had to take two weeks off
because of the fourth of July holiday
and then also because my mom was
visiting from Alabama last week so I was
actually taking her to the airport to go
home last Tuesday at 4:00 and I was
really sad about it
hi everybody oh my gosh so many people
what up okay um so today we're gonna be
doing another PR haul I did ask on my
Twitter like normal what you guys wanted
to see in today's alive and PR haul one
it was really close for a while between
a Q&amp;amp;A and then another like YouTube tips
video I was gonna have that be focused
on like making money on YouTube but PR
Hall won out by like 44% I think so make
sure Oh
sometime this week I will be doing
another Twitter poll so make sure you
vote for what you want to see next week
so I have a lot of stuff here though
like this is kind of overwhelming so I'm
just gonna hop right in and then I'll
just be checking out the comments hi
guys Jennifer wants to see the morphe PR
I'm gonna show you guys my morphe PRL
because like let me tell you that was so
overwhelming so I'm gonna grab with some
recent packages that just came to me
this is a skincare box I just got this I
just tore it open before I started this
is from Charlotte alacra Charlotte
Lacroix ooh and then inside is not this
I clearly just opened it
um so let's see inside I'm pretty sure
this was skincare we have all this fun
stuff that I feel like areas would just
die to get her hands on okay all right
so inside we got some hey my
notifications blah oh my god
you guys are so funny okay so inside we
have some skincare we have a gentle
cleanser right here cleansers are
is my jam I start every morning off with
a cleanser it's just what I do
Oh Mickey said my highlight is on point
thank you
I actually filmed this look this is like
my sweat proof makeup and I'm going to
be putting it to the test tonight at
volleyball cuz I play volleyball at 6:45
and it's supposed to be 90 degrees so
we're gonna see I have like waterproof
or like long wearing makeup on and we're
gonna test it out and we're gonna see if
it's wet proof because I'm real nervous
to play volleyball in 90-degree weather
I'm not even gonna lie I might think
okay but from also from Charlotte
lacrosse is the firming face serum
I think am I supposed to be putting them
over here so you guys can see them oh
I'm watching my dog get off the bench
don't knock over the ring light and then
the ring light cord is there and I swear
she's gonna knock it over every time and
then we also have a firming day cream
I'm done with that down with that okay
you can't see them over here okay good
because I think my comments oh my gosh
a super chat I gotta forgot all about
super chat my niece is here Maya look
now you're gonna be crying you silly
people okay well my niece is here that
means so much to me Thank You Maya and
then the super chat thank you so much if
you guys don't know what a super chat is
you can actually basically donate money
to me to my channel and then your
comments are highlighted and they come
to the top so I can see what your
comments are and such and I decided
because I got some with my last super
chat and I was trying to decide I think
pretty sure what I want to do is maybe
have the super chat money go to my I'm
having my super chat money maybe go to
my village hall because I've been really
wanting to do a haul from Beauty lish
but I thought maybe I could do like a
beauty lush haul for me and a beauty
ledge haul for for a giveaway too and
have a kind of be like a two-in-one
that's what I'm thinking to do what the
super chat money so yeah oh my gosh huh
way to start off this live making me all
freaked out here okay okay and then this
is a renewal eye cream and these don't
look really nice I bet I'm not I mean I
just got these like oh wait I can open
this one the packaging all looks really
nice if I can get them out like look how
fancy that packaging is um Kim says why
can't I see you I'm not sure can I can
other people see me if you can't I would
say like maybe go go out and then try to
come back in maybe that would be the
best way to do it but someone says just
keeps going choppy so um if you follow
me on snapchat I had an issue today with
Verizon we're having lots of issues so
even though I work from home and hang
out I like took off my data or whatever
cuz we could we keep getting charged for
cell phone data even while we're here on
Wi-Fi which is really frustrating so I
took off my data like just in case
because they're like oh you probably
have a weak Wi-Fi signal and I'm like um
okay sorry I'm just reading the comments
so I turned that off so hopefully it
doesn't mean that the live connection
won't do super well so I don't know but
that is all the skin care that I got
from Charlotte Lacroix so I'm super
excited about this again like very fancy
packaging I like it and I love skincare
I did just post the skincare video to on
my favorites so I am excited to give
these a try okay and I totally forgot my
friend Katie said that she would be a
moderator for me today and I forgot to
ask her to be a moderator so dang it I
totally spaced to that so oh my gosh oh
my gosh
ah you guys yes yes yes making me crash
okay mmm moving on I feel like people
who will watch us on the replay are
probably gonna be like what is your
problem but lives are just so much
they're just so much fun I was super
nervous about doing them when I first
decided I was gonna try a life but I
actually have a blaster doing them I
think it is so much fun
so I got some more skincare here this is
from dr. roe buck Roebuck it's a natural
nourishing creme cleanser yes I need a
moderator I know I totally I totally
spaced it totally spaced it they also
sent me the healthy skin pack which
looks like this I know a couple you're
saying that you can be a moderator I
don't know how I would put you as a
moderator right now though since I'm
already on so how do I lick the Burberry
lippies I did get some lipsticks from
Burberry which was crazy I haven't tried
them yet because I was gonna try them in
a tutorial which i think is going to be
tomorrow but I'm gonna try them for a
Instagram tutorial and I'm super excited
so I also got a package here from
colorscience oh my gosh has anyone told
me that I look like Taylor Swift no I
have never gotten Taylor so if I don't
think more skincare stuff I know I'm
such a skincare Havok I honestly I say
no a lot when I get messages and from
companies asking me to send things
especially skincare because I feel like
skincare is like I don't know I just get
a lot of emails and I say no to a lot of
things and I'm always really sad too but
I'm like you can't try everything like
it's not physically possible to try it
all but things that really catch my eye
I say yes to okay so this is from color
science and they come with this cute
little box here and then we have a
natural finish press foundation Thank
You Carmen Thank You Carmen
and then we also have a beauty palette
on the go can I open this up okay so
this is from color spy and oh that's
really cute
I like it okay I see some of you guys
giving me tips
Verizon tips it's so weird though
because they said I talked more to
someone on Twitter and they said it's my
husband's phone they were like oh um
between what they say 4:00 and 5:00 a.m.
or something his phone is using a ton of
data a ton of data and we're like well
we're sleeping and on Wi-Fi so why would
that be so I don't know we got to figure
out what the heck is going on there it's
super annoying but yeah especially for
two people and then one sits on home
sits at home on Wi-Fi for us to be
getting charged so many like so many
gigs is just absolutely ridiculous and
then this is what the powder looks like
I do get Sarah Jessica Parker a lot yeah
a lot of people tell me I look like her
I'm such a Sex in the City fan oh hey
kidding me
oh okay so that was from color science
has anybody used color science they are
new to me but I am excited to try them
out um I got some eye masks here from
black I think is how you would pronounce
it um it says yeah so it says they're
just eye patches so I probably I need to
like open everything up beforehand
otherwise I could be here for a very
long time trying to get things open okay
well these our eye masks from black I
love I'm s I'm like completely addicted
to them it is ridiculous how much I love
them um oh my gosh I have so much stuff
okay so you guys asked me about Burberry
this is the annoying part of doing PR
hauls live those because I can't I don't
have a table so I have to like reach
down to get stuff so don't mind me okay
so I got this package from Burberry
which I was like wait what Burberry so
this is what they sent me and then when
you open it up there is a three diff
and liquid lipsticks here and then also
some lip pencils so this is what the
packaging looks like for Burberry so
let's see this one looks to be like a
nude this one is in fawn so I think
that's a nude let me see it would be
still very thick okay okay I'm
definitely gonna have to charge these
out on my lips okay so that is fun tisha
smells finally get to catch you live hey
girl
what up what up I saw someone say do a
giveaway just wait I'm filming my NYX
lipstick give away very shortly Nick
sent me like 122 lipsticks I think or
something like that and I'm gonna do
four separate giveaways with I think
each one has 20 different lipsticks in
it
that video was coming very soon this one
is called oxblood okay let's see here
now these feel very thick I'm trying to
tell just by the swatches what I think
they remind me of it might be honest
Asya and I don't really like Anastasia
so I don't know there is oxblood and
then the last one they sent over is
what's that bright plum I thought it
said knife plum whatever so bright plum
that's kind of cool okay so that one is
bright plum so definitely the one that I
like the most of course is fun so I love
how you left yourself thank you someone
tell me how to donate thank you I'm
Kristina Howard donate there Shh I think
there's something with like if you see
it like a dollar sign symbol somewhere
if you click on that it should give you
how to do this
same with Michelle I think am i right
you guys want to say it in the comments
but there should be like a
like a green dollar sign and then you
can do it through there so I don't know
if anybody has any other good ideas of
what I could do with the super track
money to let me know but I know a lot of
people have been been wanting to see me
do the beauty lish haul so I thought I
could do the beauty lush haul but have
it be like a two-in-one haul for me a
haul for the giveaway you know what I'm
saying I don't know that's what I'm
thinking right now but let me know if
you guys have any other better ideas but
that was what Burberry sent me which was
like Burberry like what okay um let's
see here moving on I don't even know
okay this I got um some goodies of from
Catrice Catrice cosmetics which I was so
excited for because I hadn't tried them
I am actually wearing their mascara
right now I featured it and it get ready
with me if you guys do watch this on the
replay I'll have everything linked down
below as I'm saying them and then um
what was I saying I'll have everything
linked down below and you did not read
the pack and you did not read the
contents while I'm trying to talk but
I'll have everything linked down below
when the video uploads as a regular
video cuz I can't pull out the
description box ahead of time but this
is from Catrice cosmetics this is their
the nude blossom collection eyeshadow so
that is what it looks like
would anybody want to see if they send
me a lot of stuff would you want to see
a video with like the Catrice cosmetics
this is their liquid metal cream
eyeshadow full face of Sephora makeup oh
do me like the Sephora brand makeup
because I would be interested in that I
haven't actually tried a lot from them
and then this is their highlighting
powder this is in champagne campaign
whoo that's pretty oh okay so that's the
Catrice highlighter the Sephora
foundation is amazing okay okay good to
know
I want to try those those drops that
luster Lux always did she made them like
she sold many of those well not really
cuz I don't bottom yet but she sold me
on wanting to try those like that and
then let's see what else we have we have
there liquid metal eye shadow in mobs
like Jager full face Sephora samples
challenge dude I could probably do that
I was cleaning out my office last night
I got I don't know I got such a weird
vibe going on last night I all sudden
cleaned that never happens like if my
mom's watching she probably just like
keeled over but I found so many samples
everywhere like in every nook and cranny
in my office was another bag of samples
I'm like was probably me um this is
their lip cushion and what happens after
midnight oh okay so that's what it looks
like I'll have to play around with that
a little bit and then they also sent
along this looks like a lipstick in red
said black okay so that is what the
lipstick looks like and then they also
sent along a volumizing lip booster it
says a lip gloss that contains menthol
all right so that is the lip volumizing
lip booster from Catrice so if you guys
want to see any sort of videos with all
of this stuff from Catrice i'll let me
know are any of the characters and your
books based off of you
not like particularly on my first book -
my first book destined to fail has some
of my past in it I've been through like
some of use and stuff like that and that
situation is
mentioned but then everything else that
happens this fiction in there but kind
of that backstory is in there but um not
really any other ones are based off of
me um you know I take little bits from
my life I take little bits from my
friends life and then I just kind of mix
them all together and out comes the
story one of the most one of the harder
things about being an author for sure is
that everybody thinks they're in the
book everybody thinks you are characters
in the book like that is really really
frustrating like when I publish my first
book I had people coming out with a
woodwork like why did you write about me
and I'm like who do you think is you and
then they always say the character name
I'm like how do you even see that like
it's really it's a it's honestly kind of
bizarre so I don't know that's a little
weird um really exciting stuff here
though but I got the tweezer men and
huda beauty collab like are you kidding
me when they showed up I was like a lot
but even cooler
just today tweezerman announced that
they chose me as their ambassador of the
month for July which is so crazy so if
you go to the tweezerman blog you'll see
like a little interview with me which
was so so cool so when I run this upload
it's like a regular video I'll have that
link down below and I think I'm gonna
post an Instagram eyebrow tutorial today
which you guys might know I'm not really
like an eyebrow person so I'll show you
interesting can't wait but the
collection it has this magnifying mirror
and it is up magnified like oh my
goodness it comes with two different
sets of tweezers and they both have huda
beauty on it and the lips so there's
that pair and then there's also a mini
parrot which for some reason I'm finding
myself reaching for the mini Paramore
we're not really sure if I have a
reasoning for that but I do it comes
with a little pair of scissors which is
awesome I actually trimmed my eyebrows
for the first time which I've never done
so that was kind of terrifying and then
it comes with the spoolie so you can buy
and then it also comes with this lip bag
and you can either buy it as a set with
the bag or you can buy the items
individually I thought that was really
neat to see a tweezer and
to collab I was like okay yeah I was
really excited to get it because I got
it I was like so like surprised about it
oh yeah the mirror has little like
sticky things on the back which is cool
and then they asked oh hey oh my gosh
thank you so much but it was kind of
cool to get it and then just maybe like
a week later if they said I've ever
thought about painting my room another
color every single day since I've moved
in here four years ago I don't know why
someone painted this room red especially
because this was an office prior and I'm
like why would you paint your office red
like why when you paint it like a nice
cheery color I don't get it but I did
not paint I did not paint this our house
when we moved in was actually all
different colors like we have a mint
green bathroom my husband has like a sky
blue bedroom or bathroom our bedroom is
orange my bathroom is purple like our
porch is red like our deck is red like
the people who lived here before us just
I think really loved color so I don't
know but like I was saying I got the
tweezer Minh huda beauty collab which
really surprised me because I've gotten
a few things from tweezerman before but
I honestly didn't think they would send
me the who to collab because like that's
I mean who does such a huge deal so I
was really surprised and then it was a
week later they emailed me and said they
chose me as their ambassador I was like
oh my gosh me like so cool I know I'm
such a nerd okay so I have some stuff
from work for you to shoot you're good
oh man oh man some more fees sent me a
package and it was insane but wait
there's more okay there's more MRP and
wait there's more and this is all full
of brushes
like what yeah like what even is this
I was so huh I'm so shocked like so
shook and it was so neat because my mom
was here um when the package came and we
got to open it together and she was just
like oh my gosh are you kidding me and I
was like I don't know so I'll run
through everything that they sent me I'm
not gonna be able to swatch everything
because we I have six eyeshadow palette
alone so I'll just show everything and
I'm not keeping all these these some of
these will be in a giveaway I'm gonna
pick and choose you know which ones are
my favorite or which ones that I was
wanting to buy but then there's gonna be
giveaway because I can't forget keep all
this thing um but they sent along the
35w which looks like this if you want to
donate some stuff to your favorite niece
who's going to college go right ahead I
see that my eyes you my if you have a
favorite palette that I shall let me
know besides 35s cuz I've wanted that
one for a long time so that is the 35w
and then we have the 35k this is one
that I want it for a long time too
this was almost my first morphe palette
purchase but I ended up going with a 35
t just overwhelming
then we have the 35 n she looks like
this
I did get asked um because I I showed
this on my snapchat too and they asked
if I had a discount code with more feet
no I think you gotta be a real fake the
whole four feet yeah they just done a
nice package but this was the 35 species
that look how colorful this is super
cool my snapchat is Samantha March
Mantha period March okay and then we
have the 35 P this one was really pretty
this one is the 35 P so lots of pretty
purple is in there I try to be cool and
when I show on snapchat and I do like
the PR hauls like I wish I could be cool
like everybody else and like everyone
plays like the rap music and they got
like cool things going on and I'm over
here just like crying and like making
the weirdest noises ever I'm life my
plan one day I'll get it - yes sir okay
and this is the 35 f I'm one of those
pallet for so long Oh oh my gosh just so
cool okay I think that's all of the yeah
so those are all of the eyeshadow
palettes they sent me like are you
kidding are you kidding me okay they
also sent along some face palette okay
okay so we got some base palettes in
here so this is the 9c so crazy oh oh
the comments are coming in best in case
I guess I love your reactions and you
get PR thanks cuz I feel like the
biggest nerd when I do
I really do mean this is the 9bz doesn't
so pretty
Oh brick says I love your last thing and
this is the 9b I've my this is my first
so long uh
okay here's the night vegan I don't
think no I don't have any of their face
pals but I wanted to try out for so long
so I'm super excited so you guys know I
really like their eyeshadow palettes um
I really like their brushes and then
also the liquid lipsticks loving the
liquid lipsticks this is the 9n okay and
then that oh this is a couple as I said
this this is the desi danger palette
like I didn't think they would send
because this is a collaboration look how
beautiful that is this was one that I
actually talked myself out of getting
and then I regretted it because so many
people said they loved it like Babs
Beauty has like hit pan on a bunch of
these and I was like where it was should
I get that I think I got asked what
music I listen to I love that I just
like music um I like rap written hip hop
but I also like can wear like rock we
just saw Metallica and Avenged Sevenfold
in concert I think we're going to who
said that we're going to see in October
in Kansas City now I can't remember I
have like so many bands scrolling
through my head I can't remember my
husband goes to way more concerts than
me like he's the concert king but
sometimes the Queen comes along just
kidding yeah but I do love going to rock
concerts those are so much fun like
Bullet For My Valentine we saw who are
we seeing in October nope got nothing I
can't remember okay
they also sent me Oh
these brushes are you kidding me oh my
goodness gracious
so I mean I can't even show Ollie I
don't know how many brushes there are I
couldn't even show them all on my
snapchat so I was like there's just so
many like and I need to go through and
see like you know which ones I have
doubles of or which ones that like I
don't think I need so I can put them in
a upcoming giveaway too but like I don't
even know man this is crazy
I did see when I was doing an answer on
snapchat the impact
but if this brush for so long um yes you
can buy my books on Amazon you just look
up Samantha March they shall be there so
yeah this is really overwhelming so I
definitely need to do huh I definitely
need to go through this and decide and
then do a giveaway I can pay my room
those brushes yes the problem that I
have was painting my room like sometimes
I get frustrated because people will
leave me comments like you know oh I
have you paint your room yonder blah
blah blah like that's actually a really
big project and this is you know this is
my office space this is my my everything
like I would either have to take a bunch
of stuff out or push stuff up because
like my desk is against the wall my
bookshelf is against the wall this desk
is against the wall like I would need to
be moving things out my I wouldn't be
able to film my setup would just be my
you know my desk would be ever like it's
a really big project to do that so like
the actual painting doesn't bother me
Brian paint doesn't bother me painting
you know I could be fun
but it's the actual having to take
everything out like that's really
overwhelming to me and honestly like I
would rather sell this house we're
finishing our basement right now and I
think as soon as the basements finish
we're gonna put it on the market and I'm
just ready to go man I'm just ready go
I've been in this house for too long um
let's see okay I'm like sweating from
that more feet Oh seriously huh so
overwhelming I just got this too from
thrive cosmetics I was literally
unboxing it as soon or like five minutes
before I went to get on and need to do
some research on thrive cosmetics
because I think there are pretty cool
brands they say beauty with a purpose
for every product you purchase we donate
one to a woman in need which i think is
amazing so this is a an eyebrow liner am
I reading that right oh I think this is
like a eyebrow pencil I was just saying
today I want to try different eyebrow
pencils and stuff because benefit like I
don't know benefits doing some weird
things lately guys I'm not really
and then this is a waterproof eyeliner
I'm not really feeling the benefit
campaigns that they have going on has
anybody even seeing like the things that
they're saying like it's a little
strange to me um this is an eye
brightener highlighting stick that
sounds pretty cool and then this is a
liquid stain it says glossy lip mark
okay I kind of an open that eyebrow
pencil um just to see what it looks like
yeah I was thing about maybe getting
that Anastasia um brow is that everybody
loves because everybody says it's so
easy to use I mean you know I'm not brow
person so it makes me a little bit on
the nervous side okay so that's what the
pencil looks like so yeah benefit too
much negativity like what was the one
that they said about I can't remember
the exact terminology but like ugly too
pretty or something like that like
basically if you don't do your eyebrows
you have bad eyebrows are ugly and I'm
like excuse me like I don't know that
wasn't cool I think the other one there
getting flack for right now is something
about skipping schools or something like
that skip school do your brows skip
school don't skip your brows or
something like that but like they've had
some weird stuff about basically like
your looks and stuff and I'm not really
I'm not really done with that so I'm
getting kind of mad actually um so I
don't know if anybody has brow
recommendations I heard about it on the
makeup minutes a day okay I'll have to
watch that one skip school if not
conceal her God okay this is what the
lip looks like someone has a brows stamp
see I'm still so nervous with brows I
feel like I understand how to do a duo
of them with a pencil now but uh yeah I
know how to do them with a pencil so I'm
like I'm just going to keep doing that
until I feel more comfortable it's just
you're something you know what I'm
saying
but these are fun arrive cosmetics I'm
super excited about that and then I also
got some mascaras here from Sigma Beauty
which I thought was pretty cool they
sent some just really nice packages over
um
so they sent me three different mascaras
the high-caliber lash also the
monumental lash and then the Sansui lash
not 100% huh to say that Sigma didn't
also come out with two new brushes today
and I'm so excited about them um I have
in my car already and I do have I'm an
affiliate with Sigma so if you ever want
to purchase anything from Sigma I love
their brushes um you can use 10% off
with code Samantha um but yes I love
their brushes the most they do have nice
makeup though I really like their aura
blushes and the power lipsticks I think
are good too oh and the eyeliner mm-hmm
like that Lenore - so they did send
along some mascaras which I thought was
very cool okay I feel like we're kind of
getting towards the end oh let me show
you what I just got today I just hold
it's over here so I gotta get I gotta
get oh okay I got this big ol box today
and I was like what is in this box and
it is nail polishes from Sally Hansen oh
my goodness so crazy so it's actually
pretty cool because it says what see
Sally Hansen has partnered with Crayola
to develop this back-to-school
collection inspired by classic Crayola
Crayons and then oh then it just has
some up there uh so it's fun for adults
only
does anybody have like adult coloring
books because I know I was teaming those
were like um kind of like the the thing
I don't have any but I would totally be
down for that so okay so this is
everything I got so all these different
nail polishes and then some Koreans in
between I thought that was so freaking
cool Brooke you have a lot of coloring
books see I know so many people have a
ton I don't have any I wonder does it
help to like I don't want I don't know
if I want to say calm you down but like
I have that mind that just raise its
races bracelets like my mind never shuts
off a lot of times I can't sleep because
I'm just constantly thinking about
things like I'm
like I sleep with a notepad next to my
bed so I can wake up and write stuff
down so I didn't know if it was if it
would help you like call me I don't know
because I need something because I'm
tired a lot yeah this was from sally
hansen which i thought was so cool I
actually filmed it declutter yesterday
should be going up on Friday and I
actually declutter two of the insta
dries and from there aligned because I
said they were just too old and then
this comes today I was like hey Tinka um
I thought that was so I just thought
that was funny timing because I suck at
decluttering so bad I'm definitely a
hoarder and I just have a really hard
time getting rid of things so when I was
picking nail polishes to get rid of it I
was like no and then this game felt like
you did the right thing you did the
right thing girl okay I think we have
just a couple more things left and then
we will be done what time are we at 34
minutes okay fantastic
oh my sorry oh sorry sorry sorry okay um
this little package came from
Dermalogica
and it has like mini travel sizes of
some of their items and here which I saw
the pre cleanse which has me really
excited because I love the pre cleanse
so much I use it all of the time so I
thought mini would be super cool because
I could take that traveling with me and
then also the daily super Fowley ant
which I use all of the time as well so
I'm excited we'll check out the guide of
that and then also there are multi
active toner which I actually have never
tried so I am excited about that so I
thought that was just like a cute next
little package I was like okay the
screamy
so just some little samples of their
skincare and then we just have one more
package and then I'm pretty sure we are
done yes okay okay okay boy oh you guys
are giving me such good ideas I know
it's there I feel like the time went
really fast here I thought I was doing
good no you look and see 35 minutes I'm
like wasted
I thought I've been on for like ten uh
someone okay
I kind of missed that comment but
something about clutter and being a
creative person I heard that like
creative people are like kind of like
clutter people like we kind of like to
live in chaos and I feel like that's so
true because I found this way my whole
life like my mom used to clean my
bedroom from me for me because I just
want to do it like I just I don't know
and when things are super clean it
almost like gives me anxiety like I'm
like oh like I can't find anything and I
can't like this I don't I don't know
it's so weird but I'm totally that way I
cleaned my my my desk last night and I
all I had on it with my two spinners and
then one I'm like plastic organizer
sorry this keeps do more things um so I
have the two spinners on it and then one
plastic organizer and it just gave me
anxiety I had to pull out another
plastic organizer and put it on the desk
I couldn't do it I couldn't it was so
clean and I was like oh no need more
need more stuff I don't know that's the
way I am so I got a really nice package
from DHC and then Prine got me pre not
me is like kind of similar to like an
Influenster but it's based for the
influencers only but you can apply to be
in different campaigns and then you get
products and you know you have to read
them in a certain amount of days things
like that so I was kind of surprised to
get this though because I actually was
in the last deed
am i back sorry I think it cut out I'd
said my livestream like ended or
something weird and my back does anybody
see me okay
I think it did it the last time I think
that I did the first one it's almost
like when I get to the 30 40 minute mark
like YouTube's like what are you doing
stop talking so I think I'm back but
they sent along this bubble foaming mesh
I did an Instagram video with it you
like pour soap in it and then you like
cleaning your face I don't know it was
kind of strange but I actually already
have one of those so that yeah they sent
along like the deep cleansing oil I
already have that but they sent me so
that we're going to give away their poor
face wash I believe I have that as well
I don't have this this is poor milk
so my video went black I know I got
kicked off maybe go out and then try to
come back in I'm sorry I'm talking to
too much this is what their poor milk
looks like I'm actually excited to try
that one and they also sent along some
eye masks which I have from the first
package they sent me and then this is
all aversion oil cotton swabs okay
I'm gonna have to try those out cuz I
have no idea what to think about that
but I was super stoked because they sent
me a liquid eyeliner the DHD liquid
liner is like my new favorite ahh so
excited to get another one because I
have to be like almost done with my
other eyeliner this is so so good you
can find out the DHD website and then
also on Amazon I found him - such a good
liquid liner seriously like so good but
