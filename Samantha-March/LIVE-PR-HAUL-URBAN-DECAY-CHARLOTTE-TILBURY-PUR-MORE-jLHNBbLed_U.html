like I have to start every live being
like I don't know what's going on with
YouTube but like once again I don't know
what's going on because it just took me
two tries to get on and each time it
keeps saying that the YouTube app is
crashing so as always how we start off
live chats I don't know if we're
actually gonna get through this whole
thing so we will see but hi everybody
how are you doing I'm going to find my
live chat right away because I always
forget to do this and I'm not forgetting
this week hi everybody hello Kourtney
Nika amber hello okay let me find my
live chat here and so I can see the
comments hello everybody I hope your
Thursday is going well Jennifer says my
class was canceled tonight yeah awesome
okay so like I do every single week I
did a poll on Twitter I asked what you
guys would want to see in a live chat
and PR Hall 1 by I think it was 41% and
I just thought that was so funny because
was it last week that we talked about
what did I call it PR backlash I think
it was and just how people what they
think of PR hauls and beauty bloggers
getting PR in general and you know
there's so many comments in there that
were like PR hauls shouldn't happen you
know they should be over with and I'm
like but interestingly enough whenever I
put PR haul in my Twitter pull it always
wins to the point where we were doing PR
holes almost every single week does
anybody remember that we were doing PR
holes almost every single week because
they kept winning and finally I was like
if you just take out PR haul from the
Twitter poll it can't win so there was
several weeks there where I just took it
completely out because I'm like I want
to talk about other topics and you know
do other do other things but I put it in
this week because I had gotten a few fun
packages so I was like well I'll just
see if anybody who wants to do it and
then of course it wins I was like okay
so that's why we're doing a PR haul so
clearly there are still a lot of people
out there that enjoy seeing these and I
like doing them live I think I
only do them in a live chat versus like
a regular video I haven't earned to do
more on Instagram stories because it's
nice to be able to take the brands over
there so that's good but I think this is
kind of like the only style that I would
do the PR l PR hauls in I just think
it's like a different I don't know I
just feel like it's kind of like a
different vibe doing it live so yeah but
as always if you guys have any other
suggestions that you would like to see
for live chat please do let me know you
can let me know in here or this video
will re upload as a regular video once
we're done and if you want to come back
on that video and leave a comment so I
can see it there too if you have any
other suggestions or ideas for a live
chat so just let me know because
sometimes I always put three in the
Twitter poll and sometimes I'm like I
just don't know what else to talk about
like what do you guys want to see so let
me know and I'll say this at the end the
video too but next week is Thanksgiving
next Thursday is Thanksgiving and I do
celebrate Thanksgiving and I will be
either on the road or you know with my
family off Thursday hey Kati I will
either be on the road or with family
that whole day and I know a lot of other
people are gonna be with their family
too high in Georgia hey um so there will
be no live chat next Thursday but I
don't always post a video on Saturdays
and I will have a Saturday video for
Shore and then so I just want to let you
guys know I'll say it at the end too but
I am excited um let's see I have I think
maybe like six or so packages that to
talk about in here so I am so excited hi
hello everybody okay let's see where
shall we begin I tried my best to like
finagle my setup good enough and then I
started watching Jen loves reviews like
I don't know 40 minutes before the light
right and then I got all caught up in it
I was crying and it was a big ol mess
what a night what a night
broken nail went got it fixed can you
guys see how much longer my one nail is
than the other one
she made the one like Talon like oh boy
oh boy it's fine it's we're gonna make
it through
we're gonna make it through Oh George I
cried too I did just it's such a it's
such an overwhelming feeling being
called trusted that is what really gets
me when people can say that they trust
me or when people say like I'm relatable
like like we have friendships and stuff
those are the things that get me over or
anything else like now I'm gonna get
upset that's what means the most to me
truly honestly so that was really cool I
I saw that she was gonna do that video
she had put it on on Twitter and I was
like yeah cool chat I didn't know she
was actually gonna be shouting out
channels in that video I was her so
excited to see what she was gonna say
and then all of a sudden I'm like what
oh that's so cool Melissa says I love
that we have a date every Thursday yeah
I like our date too okay so let's see I
want to start this on Cazalas okay don't
cry every time I go oh areas is coming
did you find us
did you find this I was editing my video
that I filmed today first Sunday and I
didn't realize it but all of a sudden
here comes Aries in the background I
don't come up come up okay you don't
have to she doesn't she doesn't hung on
the chair right now so we'll wait for
you okay yeah no problem
we'll wait for you okay but first off um
I got a another package from Charlotte
Tilbury and I just the FedEx man came I
went out and grabbed it and I was like
okay thank you and I looked at it and
said Charlotte Tilbury and I was like
Aries get inside get it like ah and I
was saying it on my snapchat and I think
I mentioned it when I did another life
pyrrha haul in the past and I had gotten
my first package from Charlotte Tilbury
Charlotte Tilbury was a brand too if you
guys aren't familiar with what actally
is I know a lot of beauty bloggers are
like being accepted over there now but
it's really cool concept where
it's a place that basically links brands
and bloggers and bloggers can basically
it's like send like a proposal to a
brand like they'll have items up there
that you can review and you can say I
want to review it for this reasons and
you know etc etc and they can either
accept or deny you and it's different
from PR because you are obligated to
review it it doesn't matter if you love
it or if you hate it but you do have to
review it and you have to review it
within 21 days so very different from PR
you get PR you don't have to mention it
ever you can talk about it you can show
it you don't have to and Charlotte
Tilbury was in the octal e free store
like when I first got my account and I
wrote this big long proposal and I was
like I'm basically the best person ever
and you should love me and you know all
these different things and they were
like no no I was like what no okay well
hmm let's try again later
and then you know a year later or
whatever it was I got an email from the
Charlotte so very brand saying we would
like to send you something and I was
like what so I mean I just I like to say
all those stories too you know maybe it
sounds like some encouragement or
motivation or whatever it may be because
I just I always think that's really cool
NYX was another brand that was the same
thing I reached out to NYX I was all
excited and they're like thanks but no
thanks medley okay yeah I know I get it
and then they eventually contacted me so
just a little maybe a little bit of
motivation it's something that
definitely encourages me because I'm
like I still reach out to brands and I
still get turned down quite often so you
know it does what it did just gonna keep
on working but they did send me a new
package this is what the package looks
like what getting rid of snapchat was
getting real snapchat I'm not getting
rid of snapchat I love snapchat I do be
on snapchat all day I have to remind
myself sometimes get off snapchat they
you are annoying people stop it
you know um Oh big congratulations to
Katie as well if you guys Katie and my
moderator she'll be like in blue with a
little wrench buy her make sure to click
our name and go to her channel she had a
thousand subscribers recently I know I'm
not sure if it's still opened kitty you
can remind me I know she has a giveaway
going on for hitting that milestone
which is super cool and when the video
does free upload as a regular video I'll
fill out my description box and she's
always linked at the top so if you're
watching on the replay Jake okay it's
Jean okay and then this is what I do
have to have my ring light on of course
because it's very dark but this is the
what oh the giveaway it's all of an
excellent Katie awesome okay so that's
what it looks like and then this is what
the inside looks like if I could not
blind you guys so that is what the
inside looks like and how it's broken
down is a day I a dust guy a date I and
a disco I and so there's three in each
one so I thought that was pretty cool do
you guys want me to swatch it do I have
tweezers buy me in case I I try to make
sure I had everything open I have makeup
wipes with me I tried I tried to come
really prepared but I'm really
interested in this because I've never
tried it does look like a Nikki
appellate you're right yes I have never
tried Charlotte Tilbury eyeshadows so I
saw this I was like so wait oh they're
nice and soft okay so this is date I so
there are the three swatches there okay
so that is date I the first one is
really really light but it's it'd be
nice for like what I come in with with
mobile when I come in with with my first
color I did it again with with my first
color all over my eye and then we have a
nice neutral Brown and then a bit of a
shimmer so that one is day I gonna get
my oh shoot I meant to look up this
palette so I have the price and I didn't
do that cuz it didn't come with like a
flyer or anything
sorry guys okay and then we have desk I
this guy looks like what I would really
be into here is
desk I uh Amy says thanks for doing such
as I know you really don't like doing
them I don't like putting my fingers in
makeup I don't know what it is I feel
like I should not be a beauty youtuber
for that reason like why don't I want to
put my hands and make up I don't know
so then the last three here are the desk
I so wait now I'm gay
okay yeah because the first one is so
light over here I'm like wait a second
what
oh it's $75 I'm sure I tell variable $75
I mean at least the packaging is really
nice so we got that going for it the
swatches are really pretty so far it's
not like excessively blowing me away yet
or anything but those were day I and
desk i but like I said I of course will
be trying everything on my eyes to so I
can get a review I'm I'm trying to
decide what to do because I have some PR
items what do you guys think should I do
like um I don't know just like a review
video just full of PR stuff I've done
that once before but like again some
like not so many but there are some
comments and they're like this is PR so
I can't watch it and I'm like huh I'm
just trying to be helpful
yeah I don't know if you guys have ideas
on how you'd like to see these or like I
get ready with me using some of these
makeup makeup products but actually
having used them so I can review them at
the same time I don't know let me know
okay so the next one we have is date I
which actually date I looks pretty -
okay so there is date I ooh okay so
these are my favorite so far oh yeah I
like those shimmers a lot there is date
I okay and then the last one is going to
be disco I oh wait so I'm still up here
on my comments Deb says did you know
they're going to get rid of snapchat
what they're gonna get rid of the app is
that true I feel like
I feel like I really enjoy snapchat
especially for the like the stories like
the articles I have on there
those are insanely helpful to me I read
those every single day almost every I
feel like I learned so much I was
reading about forgetting like virus the
other day that now I'm you know scared
but I mean I read so many different
things on there I think it's so
fascinating that would make me really
sad I hope that's not true
um well comment skipped you're on dang
it okay I'll get back okay but disco I
okay we're gonna swatch disco I just go
it looks pretty interesting ooh that
black so everything has swatched pretty
much the same except for the black it
kind of felt dry so we'll just see yeah
the black doesn't the black doesn't
swatch very well it's not very black and
it kind of is just like I don't know
that one probably wouldn't be my
favorite black again I'm just going off
swatches so you know I'll try everything
on my eyes but I'm so excited but this
uh the shade right here I think it's
pretty cool they do have names but the
names are like on this little like flier
here and those I don't I don't really
ever pay much attention to those but
those are some swatches from the
Charlotte Tilbury oh one other thing
okay so it's on the back it's called the
instant eye palette it says for easy eye
looks to take you from day to dusk to
date to disco so that is the Charlotte
Tilbury I think you guys are saying in
the comments that it is $75 I know
Charlotte Tilbury is on Beauty lish I
still really want to make a purchase
from Beauty lish because you can like
break it into like several payments or
two or three payments or things like
that which is helpful but Charlotte
Tilbury is a pricy brand but I did
recently try it's right here actually um
when she sent me uh hey guys sorry it
always picks me up okay so but I should
be back now hopefully you guys can see
me but once you sent me the other PR
package
with this light Wonder Foundation and
I'm obsessed I'm obsessed with I think
it looks so good like so natural but so
beautiful it's she sent me to other
foundations and I just keep using this
one because I'm just obsessed with it I
can't stop so I'm like why open to more
foundations when I love this one so so
that makes me excited to try the
eyeshadow palette I don't feel to hear a
lot of people talking about her
eyeshadow palette I hear good things
that definitely about her lipsticks but
I'm excited to try this so I'll be
giving it a whirl so I can let you guys
know the swatches I thought were pretty
I like it's watched well but of course I
have to try it on my eyes I thought it
was really funny because I mentioned
you'd be what did I mention oh I got a
Natasha de Nona eyeshadow palette during
the Sephora vib sale but it came to me
broken so I returned it and all that but
I was saying how when I went in the
Sephora store i swatched and it took but
Natasha de nada holiday pellets and the
sunset palettes and in the video I was
like the swatches did really blow me
away like I don't know then it wouldn't
convinced me to buy if I was someone who
based solely on swatches which I don't
because I'm mostly online shop so that
really doesn't I never really swatch
anything and someone commented and was
like what was there I can't think of the
exact thing they said basically like
they were so offended that I didn't like
the way Natasha didn't own a swatch that
my my opinion their trip their trust in
my opinion or something went out the
window and I was like huh
I'm swatches like I didn't even say like
it was bad for your like it doesn't look
it off the eyes or don't buy it or I'm
never gonna buy it I just said it did
the swatches didn't blow me away I was
like how is that even how is that even a
bad thing I don't know some palettes
swatch like crap and they are fantastic
and some swatch you know vice versa I'm
like
it just gave me a little pause I was
like okay then Wow well there's that
sometimes I delete comments like that
because I honestly like kind of feel bad
for the people leaving the comment
because the other people are like are
you kidding me so I delete it because
I'm trying to be nice to them
I just let that one out there though
because I'm like really like really you
can't I feel like you just can't judge
based on swatches I just I ELISA I just
feel like you can't judge based on
swatches I don't know you have to put
them on your eyes and see you like mmm
okay
but anyway so that was Charlotte Tilbury
when the video real close to I will link
everything so everything will be in the
description box but I was shocked
shocked to get this a from Urban Decay
they send this package over and it has
the new Urban Decay concealers I was
like come again I'm so excited because I
was planning to get these and when I did
my will I buy it I talked about the
Urban Decay highlight palette which in
the video I was talking about old
palette meant to be talking about the
new palette that's my bad um but I even
mentioned in there and I ended up
cutting it out because I was like oh and
they're releasing a new concealer soon
and I'm gonna buy it and I was like no
because then you just got a totally
different subject if people are always
like on me for you know going off and
other voices been like my videos are too
long and all these things so I was like
no cut that out it doesn't have anything
to do with those with the video but I
was so excited I was planning on buying
them and then they came I was like what
so I did try one today I have it on
right now and I put it on I saw the head
of man yeah I put it on it like mmm noon
noon or so I still think it's looking
pretty good I will say so I've only used
it once so I mean
take it with a grain of salt and all of
that I used the shade wait hold on what
shade did I use where's the shape uh-oh
I can't find the shade that I used I use
the shade light/medium neutral I think
it was no no medium light neutral
that's the shade I used medium light
neutral is the shade that I used and I
will say that is definitely full
coverage I used it today with the all
nighter Foundation and I feel like I'm
like what
there was nothing to touch into this
face okay so it's definitely very full
coverage and pretty thick I will say but
one thing that I noticed that I'm gonna
have to see if it works for me or not is
that it feels kind of like a dry like a
drier concealer and sometimes I don't
always love those because I deal with
dry under eyes and sometimes if it's a
drier concealer I'm kind of like I don't
know sometimes it doesn't look great on
me but like I said I've had it on for
quite some time and I still think my
under eyes look really good and what
else say is that when I did do it feel
like I had Chinese food on my lips oh
how come nobody told me that uh what was
I gonna say oh when I first put it on
and then I set it with the wet and wild
like contouring palette and uh is it
scented
I don't smell anything but I am just
getting over a cold but I don't smell
anything
um but I thought like my undereyes
looked so good like I felt like my
entire face just look like flawless
after I use the two together the
all-nighter Foundation isn't necessarily
like my favorite foundation because I
don't always love full coverage on me
but if you're someone who needs a full
coverage concealer this could be a good
option I do want to like I want to put
one on one side in the shape tape on the
other because I know a lot of people are
asking for comparisons to shape tape
because right off first bat I didn't
really think it was like shape tape but
I'll try to do the comparison so I can
you know really see and see if there's a
difference but I don't know so those are
kind of just my first thoughts it's
super full coverage but it's a little
bit drier it is pretty thick but I
thought that the end result looked
really good and then even now like eight
hours after having it on I still think
it looks really good under my eyes I do
notice a little bit of creasing but your
girls 30 and she it's wrinkles and stuff
um but nothing nothing too bad it hasn't
like worn away or I mean like there's
nothing weird happening on my under eyes
which i think is good so I definitely
need to try it I mean this was just the
first time trying it today I'll
definitely be trying out more so I can
give a good review and give some good
comparisons based off first impressions
I still like the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer better but again first time
I'll give it a few more tries but so far
so good but those are just some of my
feedback so if you know if there's
something that I said that it is that
you absolutely hate don't go for it if
you love you can give it a try it is
releasing a December 3rd and it will be
$29 it says available at Sephora Ulta in
select Macy's and then also online
Sephora ultime season Urban Decay oh
yeah so I will say to you like I'm the
little sheet that they gave me - it says
a little bit goes a long way it for
short like it's just like shake tape
like you don't need to put a ton on
there like I think I put too much on
today and I can go a little bit lighter
and just blend it out because it really
like a little bit does go a very long
way and like they're the shade range is
like fair warm fair neutral light warm
light neutral medium light neutral
medium light warm like it's light and
warm so those are some of the shade
ranges so it goes from fair light medium
light medium medium dark dark deep and
extra deep so that is a little bit about
that I will try to get my review up
somewhere before December 3rd which
that's doable
yeah that's doable because I don't think
I have really any other new concealers
that I'm testing out right now so I can
just be trying that guy but then okay no
I need to check the comments um
Oh Deb says my daughter told me there's
something snapchat down that would be
really sad
Maya says my makeup is on fleek thank
you I filmed it for Instagram today um
let's see Oh Larry guys saying good
things about Katie I like that
I like that okay mm-hmm I did get
another item from Urban Decay too
actually
this just came today I got home from
getting my Talan nail fixed and there
was a package in there and it said
everybody came I was like wait a second
because the the all-nighter concealers
just came whatever night we went grocery
shopping Tuesday night I think it was
just came in so I was like what do you
mean what what's happening here so this
is V um the Oh can I talk about this
sometimes you sometimes you can't talk
about certain things
nope I think it's fine I think it's fine
I always I always get tripped up
sometimes when I get something new and I
just kind of like show it right away
because sometimes there's certain things
that are like don't share until this
date and I'm just over here like check
myself real quick but this is the Urban
Decay distortion eyeshadow palette the
packaging is friggin sweet that's what
the outer packaging looks like and then
and then this is what the packaging
looks like crazy right so cool okay so
this is the distortion our shadow
palette has a very large mirror and then
here are the shades and everything
inside yay Oh someone got the distortion
pot too
so cool okay a lot of guys are saying
both eyes first impressions for the P R
hmm okay okay um but anyway sorry I'm
just trying to keep up with the comments
so here are the different shades so oh
swatches swatches that's what I should
do
okay oh wait and there's a little um
mailer that came here so it says the
distortion eyeshadow palette will be $49
available exclusively from Sephora and
Urban Decay stores or online at Sephora
and Urban Decay okay ooh so it says
there are shifty and multi-dimensional
hues ten shades nine are new and five at
transformer hues oh this is interesting
okay let me just some swatches so we can
see what's going on here so oh okay so
the top row is definitely super these
must be like the Transformers so here
are the first shades oh wow okay so
that's interesting
whoa okay so I do have my ring like
right in front of me so I honestly don't
know how much like helpful this will be
with the link ring late but those are
the swatches the first four those are
super interesting
I'm just gonna have to try these because
I don't even know what I think about
them huh okay
I feel like I haven't really seen a lot
like that but those are the first of
four sub watches there's a really cool
origin here in green and some purples
that I'm really interested in okay I
gotta make sure to wipe everything off
so I'm not so I don't
okay there we go okay so here are some
more swatches I'm just gonna keep going
right down the row and I'll do like
better swatches like swatch photos and
stuff for Instagram ooh okay at least
that's can you try one over the black
I've been seeing people do that looks
amazing
okay for sure woo that ooh
okay this one was a little bit chunky
but Green was a little bit on the chunky
side but there are some more that blues
really pretty the orange one is really
cool too the green one was a little
chunky but I like how dark green it is I
think that's pretty um amber says what
palette is this this is the Urban Decay
Distortion yeah crystal says the first
floor it looked like highlighters with
the shift in them yeah I bet you could
wear the most highlights okay then I
shoulda brought a towel in here my poor
pants oh man these poor pants they're
getting a workout okay let's go for the
I'm so excited about this purple because
I love Purple's so much oh the black
feels a lot nicer than the Charlotte
Tilbury there's four more swatches
okay the purple is not exciting me as
much as I thought maybe it would but do
the black whoa the black no joke Wow so
I thought maybe the purple would be more
mm but it's actually more of a lighter
and almost kind of like more iridescent
to the black is insane are you kidding
me Oh
oh yeah I know the Purple's I'm not as
excited as I thought I was gonna be
shoot um that's that's okay we'll keep
going okay and then someone want me to
swatch one in the first row over the
black so let's give that a try that
green was pretty chunky um I feel like I
was immediately drawn to space which is
the third one so let me put space over
the black oh look at what that did
that's cool wow that's a cool color and
then when I blended it even more all
right so that's neat
so all right now I just now let's start
at popping in my head now looks really
started popping in my head at first I
wasn't having a lot going on in my mind
but the possibility is now especially
cuz that's such a frickin awesome black
okay now and I'm not even creative I
don't have a creative mind in my mind
all of a sudden my digital okay okay so
so I have the black which is called
black out and then I put space which is
the third one
that's what I put over it and then
that's the color that happened all right
I'm pretty pumped I'm pretty pumped I'm
gonna be doing I'm gonna be doing some
things here I don't know what yet but
I'll be trying it out because yeah like
like someone said you know the black
swatch is great but you gotta put it on
your eyes and the blacks not going
anywhere
okay well we might just have to skip
over that spot on my hand no big deal
okay so we got three more left to swatch
in here let's see what these look like
okay here are the last three I don't
feel like I hate when this happens when
I start saying something and then I
literally have no idea oh shoot my hand
was too wet
hold on these swatches will be corrupted
by Hanno's but shoot hold on I don't
want to give unfair swatches yeah
that's not right okay I know people are
saying when's it coming out I didn't see
that on the flyer hold on let me look
again let me look again it doesn't say
does anybody know the distortion palette
it doesn't have the date on there okay
let me get my deck the pause I'm just
gonna dab off the hands so we can do
some more swatches okay
you like that our Christmas decor is
coming out okay all right let's try
those last three again okay whoo-hoo
okay those are the last three swatches
for the palette yes it is Aries toy it's
not it's not the core it's here Toby
they're doing okay so those were the
last three I like the silver one in here
okay and back it's just gonna insist on
keep kicking me out fantastic
love it but here are the last of three
swatches I don't know when exactly for
sure I kicked me out this one I think is
pretty cool the other two are kind of
like mad to me but this one's cool but
now I'm just excited thank you
to suggest it to swatch over the black
because that's pretty cool and that gave
me some fun ideas to use with this so
those were I don't know if it's going to
let me continue because it keeps cutting
me off
so I don't know how much farther we're
gonna get because this is really
frustrating and like even last time when
it cuts me off it usually just says do
you want to resume right away and it
said YouTube keep stopping like restart
it wants me to restart the app so I'm
sorry I don't know what's happening but
that sucks
but those were the swatches from the
Urban Decay distortion palette I'm
really excited the swatches I mean like
some of them were really cool with some
of them like we're just kind of like
mint to me but I'm excited to try them
on my eyes and see what different
combinations I can come up with so again
that is the distortion palette I'm going
to try to get the
the rest as quickly as I can because I
don't know what's going on with YouTube
but I did get this box from Real
Techniques this is my first package from
Real Techniques so I thought that was
really cool they sent along some brushes
and so I'm so excited because Real
Techniques like when I was trying to
like be like you know super cool and to
make up everyone was recommending Real
Techniques so I started buying them I
have a lot of their brushes still so
it's just like one of those things like
when you catch when you catch the
attention of a brand that you've bought
for so long like it's it's I wish I
could like I wish I could actually
describe the feeling better and I don't
feel like I do but it's just so freaking
exciting but like here are some of the
brushes that they sent like this one is
like a Big Daddy and I'm like okay yes
please I want to put you on my face
these are called the blend and blur
brushes and like here's another one for
foundation you can find Real Techniques
at Ulta I don't have like a oh wait does
it say here nope it just says no okay so
it doesn't say um it does I don't have
anything like saying like when they are
out but I'm really really excited for
these I feel like YouTube like totally
took away all my mojo I was like so
excited and so into it
I'm frustrating me frustrating so yeah
so lots of lots of new lots of new Real
Techniques brushes which I'm so excited
about I'm so grateful for those I'm just
like oh especially I just want to hug
this brush I will hug this ration love
big brushes I love big fetches so I'm so
excited so cool I'm definitely be trying
these out maybe these could be the
brushes that I use if I do like get
ready with me or something I could use
the Real Techniques brushes or sure I
thought that was so cool um okay I think
we just got just one more thing and then
we'll be done just one more just one
more okay so I got this from Pierre
which was really cool
so it's called the appear pro collection
and I didn't even know this was coming
out and I was getting this or anything
so you guys are saying the ultra brush
is already there perfect I will link
them when I'm working on the description
box so inside they came out with a bunch
of different sets this would be really
cool for holiday I did do a gift guide
today it'll go up on Sunday it's already
at like 23 minutes because I tried to
include like so many different
categories but I did mention these
because I thought it was super
interesting I went through and kind of
picked out items that I know I would
want to keep for myself because I can't
keep all of those this was just too much
for me but they have like a four piece
dual and an eye shadow and eyeliner they
have some glitters in here like mini
glitter set and then when I do upload
check the description box because I'll
list everything and I'll put all the
prices of everything - they have oh we
have the highlight palette the highlight
palette which I'm keep that one and
swatch it they have a mascara set with a
fully charged mascara and the is this
the UM oh what's the word I'm looking
for the primer the primer and then they
had a couple different lip collections
this one is the berry lip and then they
have like these little minis so I'll
show you the ones that I decided to keep
for myself so one being the highlight
palette which is let me look at this the
quick Pro highlight palette is $32 for a
six pan High Beam highlight palette so
there's what it looks like that little
nasty piece of paper out of there so
there's what the highlight palette looks
like so this has me pretty excited so
let me I'll swatch a few of them in here
oh they're really soft
Wow okay so there are the highlight and
I really wanted to see if these
highlights would be similar to what is
in their vanity palettes those
highlights Wow
okay okay because I love the highlights
and those vanity palettes and I reach
for them constantly so I want to see if
they're like that and if they are I'm
gonna be real freaking stoked
no lie so that is the pure highlight
palette and then the other item we have
the nude lips why would I keep the nude
lips like come on really really and then
if you guys want to see they spectacular
way that I opened packages here a thing
dude live I was trying so hard I don't
know I thought it came on the set it
didn't in the finally I was just like
you just got to go in for a girlfriend
you're gonna be here all night
if you don't you just gotta get it done
so that's how I open packages super cool
but it comes with a nude lipstick yes
please and then also a lip liner so we
got the lip liner as well and then also
a flip flops alright so that is what the
nude gloss looks like so that is the
it's called the quick Pro lips 3-piece
nude collection and they also have the
berry and so these are $26 each for each
of the sets and then it says that these
products are available on pur cosmetics
comm Alta and Kohl's now so I will have
them linked oh I thought this is really
interesting that they have sheet masks
didn't even know so that was interesting
so the let me see
what what am i what am I looking for
I've completely lost it I've lost it
the quick Pro mass $36 six piece
holographic hydrating sheet mask also
available individually for $8 so you
guys know I love sheet Mass a selfish oh
I know I didn't know they made sure you
messy though I was like wait what didn't
know Oh Kelly Kelly oh um so I'm excited
to try these I don't even I don't even
know this was this was out there so hey
I'll definitely be giving these a shot
because I love sheet masks so that's
pretty cool and then the last item I was
like oh I probably won't keep this but
I'll at least like um you know I'll show
this one or whatnot and then I was
trying to open it so nicely so I could
still reject it and then I ended up
ripping it to I was like wow amazing
Samantha you are the bomb at opening
palettes but then I'm not mad because
these are the cutest freaking little
palettes that I've ever seen these are
what they look like oh hold on hold on
let's get it together
like they're so cute and tiny are you
kidding me and then one is the open
heads up breaking it out look at this I
open this and I was like yep this is for
me this is going in my clutch 100% and
going in my clutch thank you so much
there's a contour shade in there for me
and a bronzer shade in there for me done
going in my purse I'm so excited I'm so
excited ended up opening this one I just
thought it was so cute and I never want
to take like my contour shade and then
my bronzer shade out with me I always
have this fear that my clutch is gonna
get stolen I mean it's always on me but
I'm always afraid it's gonna get stolen
it has all my favorite makeup in it and
all these different things so I never
want to carry like my big like expensive
products that I would like cry if my
clutch got stolen that's a fear that's
so irrational who's gonna come and take
it off of my body like I cross body yet
you're not gonna get it but this is
perfect it's put in there because now
I'll have it's a mini so you know
perfect size for my clutch which isn't
huge and I got my contour and my bronzer
for touch-ups with Hello and
the other one is alone mini highlight
palette don't break another nail
girlfriend you cannot go back again okay
now go back again then it's got this
little mini highlight palette I thought
that was super exciting I just tried to
say stoked and exciting at the same time
I'm feeling so rushed now because I'm
waiting for YouTube to kick me out and
not let me come back in okay so this one
is the quick pro portables are $14 each
so and then this came as one set so the
$14 would be for the bronzer and contour
and the highlight set because these it
came in its own little I came in its own
little box so $14 for this I thought
that was pretty cool and $14 I don't
feel like that's a pepper at all for two
well mini palettes I'm pretty stoked
about that so they came up with this a
big ol pure collection and I guess the
eyeshadow palette is actually a part of
that which I have right here the appear
