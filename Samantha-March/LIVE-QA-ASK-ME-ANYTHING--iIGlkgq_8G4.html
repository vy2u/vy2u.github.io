YouTube live and I'm just gonna try to
find my life so I can watch all the
comments okay hello hello how are you
guys doing where's my Q&amp;amp;A there it is ah
found it found it
hi everybody hello okay found it found
my comments okay how's it going guys the
beginning the lives are always like the
worst because it takes me so long to
find everything but I did my Twitter
poll to see what you guys wanted to do
in this week's live and it was QA it
technically will say learnt Beauty tags
one by one percent on Twitter but to the
majority of people that wrote in on my
snapchat asked for a Q&amp;amp;A so I went ahead
and I made the executive decision to do
a Q&amp;amp;A and then here comes Aires she
wants to sit on my lap okay yup okay I
didn't even put you in my thumbnail this
week and this is the week you wanted
this is the week you wanted I didn't
even put around my thumbnail because
sometimes I put her in the thumbnail cuz
it's super awkward to take that thing
and then she doesn't come in but now it
she's so ridiculous
she's a 50-pound lap dog in case
anybody's wondering did you found that
dog here did you want to sit on this
tree and you sit by me
okay okay she's got her own chair now
okay all right so doesn't really do it
we're gonna do in QA I'm super like I'm
kind of nervous to do a life cue next I
don't know people are gonna ask me I've
done q and A's in the past but no Homer
I'm so I don't know I'll just see most
of those my brother's 90 pound
domination did the same thing I don't
know why it why do big dugs think their
lap dogs but okay okay and questions
already starting OH
oh goodness okay here we go here we go
here we go Jody says Jody Lynn that's
really where that's my mom's name do you
plan on having kids we're the same age
and I'm a mom so I'm curious your
thoughts I promise it's the most
rewarding thing in life I'm also a dog
mom
we don't have any plans right now to
have children I'm 30 and my husband is
29 but we were we just don't yet we
actually were talking about it just last
night it which is really funny kind of
talking about it because we have a lot
of friends who are pregnant right now
and we just don't feel that pole yet
he's doing like we both just do a lot I
don't know how to explain it I feel like
it sounds really selfish but I'm like we
just like to do a lot of different
things and you know with a lot of our
friends having kids you see them
not being able to do as many things and
I still want to do those things though
but probably down the line I mean we're
not against it but we just don't have
any plans at this moment so that's what
we're doing and then we got every so you
know let's see okay so let me scroll up
um
someone said what's your job I do
YouTube and that's really fun but I'm
also a published author I have five
novels published they are all available
on Amazon so yeah that I work also
pretty heavily
and the she started me crazy I worked
pretty heavily in the book industry as
well I'm a freelance like editor
proofreader I do a lot of marketing for
authors and things like that so you know
published author work in the book
industry do Beauty honors you to you
know all those things super fun Britney
says my favorite food guilty pleasure
my favorite food guilty pleasure that's
a good question you know what I really
like to eat there's no sit down she's
trying to get on the table uh one thing
that I really like to do is eat like
weird food combinations like I like to
eat a Swiss cake roll which is like a
chocolate roll with like some sort of
vanilla cream in the middle I like to
eat that and Doritos like I don't put
them in my mouth at the same time but
like I'll take a bite of escape I'll
choose both and I'll eat a Dorito
human's fault like that's a really
random combination or like a candy bar a
Milky Way candy bar with like dill
pickle chips don't tell anyone I said
that because I feel like that's very
weird like I used to eat Swift cake
girls and Doritos like that's my guilty
pleasure snack and I wouldn't do it when
Mitch and I moved in together I would
not do it in front of them for like
months and then I was like hey I like
this others neck oh let's see um IRA
says how old are you I am thirty sit
down you're driving me crazy you sit
down I can't see the question there I
can't see the questions when you are
trying to get in my face goodness
goodness goodness okay so I guess scroll
up I wish YouTube wouldn't scroll down
because then I have to scroll back up
okay have I changed my mind about prism
yet
I really haven't I haven't devil
still not thinking I'm gonna get it okay
Lee's here yeah uh Christine says how do
you manage to make video
and still find time to write it's
definitely challenging especially when
when I get editing jobs because I'm a
freelance editor I really feel like I
can never say no to a job that comes in
and I've been getting a lot of editing
jobs lately and when I have an editing
job I basically can't write because I'm
so focused on that book that I'm editing
and getting into that I can't be in my
own characters heads I then have to be
in their character set so it's hard so
because I've been getting editing jobs
which is definitely not a bad thing it's
super great but because I've been doing
that I've had to put book 6 on hold but
when I don't have any other freelance
jobs coming in and it's just YouTube and
and books then my schedule is a lot
easier but basically I mean I really
just have to give myself to do this and
like deadlines for myself like the night
before I'll make a to-do list of what I
want to get done and then I just got to
get it done you know if that means I
mean I really don't do anything else so
there's really nothing else that I'm
cutting out sometimes I have to not work
out and that really bothers me because I
like working out every day but sometimes
I can't I can't um but yeah I mean it's
all about self motivation really that's
the biggest thing and to-do list really
helped me out so let's see and jelly
says do you plan on getting any other
pets we think about it a lot we would
really love to get a second of vizsla
I'm really excited because we're
actually dog sitting for a Vizsla puppy
Nick's a weekend it's a five month old
fish loan so I'm super excited so we're
gonna see how it goes that's gonna be
kind of like our test and to see how
Ares rolls with it we did a
meet-and-greet last weekend with the
couple and the dog and it went really
well it Marius was really good so I'm
excited so I think maybe if that goes
well we'll think about getting another V
Melissa Q says what is your process when
you
want to start a new book typically when
I'm getting ready to start writing a new
book I have to sit down and plan what I
want it to be but I am NOT someone who
plans out every single chapter this
happens then this happens then this
happens because I have no idea I'm
someone who when I start writing I
basically like black out and then I come
to and words are written it's just you
know it just plays in my mind so I can't
confine my characters to doing one thing
and then this thing and then the next
thing because I don't know what they're
gonna do when I start writing but I at
least know what I want the theme to be
and then you know I have to figure out
things like where is it taking place or
do the characters names and a lot of
times what I do is I interview my
characters so I have a set of like 20
questions and I go through and I do an
interview for each of the main
characters so that way I can know just
small things what's the kind of car that
they drive what's their favorite food
what's their nervous tic what's their
word that they use repeatedly you know
things like that to get to know them
better and then I just have to start
then I just go start writing and see
where it goes from there what type of
books do I write I write women's fiction
mostly a lot of times focused on
friendships
from Louisiana hello I don't know who to
my vizsla makeup junkie says hooch my
visual of mix wants to know if Ares has
a boyfriend she does yeah
she's taken by a German Shepherd my best
friend shannon has a Duren shepherd her
or him and ares they actually the same
birthday except areas of the year older
but yeah we love to uh like we always
watch him they'll watch ares for us like
when we afford them if we go somewhere
together if we for at them they do board
it in the same room and everything
because they just they're in love
Mackenzie says what is your school job
so for the last it was the last two you
years before I started doing full-time
like when I quit my regular job I quit
my job to do full-time writing and I
worked at a hospital beforehand so I
left that job to do full-time books and
I I didn't really know this about me
because I'm you know I'm definitely an
introvert but within the first couple
months of leaving I was I was trying to
write what is now my fifth book that I
published in March and I didn't have any
voices in my head I I didn't have
anything to write I couldn't write and I
was struggling and I was breaking out to
my husband like what did I do
like I just left so I could publish more
books and now I can't even write a word
like what am i doing
and I was going to the mall during the
day and just sitting there and trying to
listen to people just to try to get
conversations I did not realize how much
I would miss having conversations with
other people I don't know it was really
crazy and so I wanted to get some sort
of job but I couldn't be gone from my
desk all day because I was still trying
to do all of my other jobs and I just
couldn't do it so Mitch suggested
looking at schools and he actually said
the school library but I ended up
looking at the schools and it was like
two weeks before school started in this
area and they were looking for a
lunchroom recess associate so basically
you would go to the school for about two
hours during the day you just hang out
with the kids in the lunchroom like make
sure they're sitting down and eating and
you know things like that and then just
kind of supervise him at recess and I
was like I can do that and the interview
was like so awkward cuz they're like do
you have kids here and I'm like no I
don't have any kids at all and they're
like why why do you work in school and I
was like I just need some voices in my
head actually that would be great but
this tired me I don't know where they
just really
yes I'm going to fill the spot and I
actually ended up writing my book in six
weeks oh it was fantastic I've never
written a book that fast it was so cool
but you know the kids they always had so
many stories to tell me and it was just
it was it was almost like so much like
it was it was really a lot of fun and I
actually ended up having so much fun I
went back for another year so I went
back last year but it was great to be
gone just two hours out of the day just
get to hang out and it was a lot of fun
but I knew I want to be able to go back
this year just even though it was two
hours it was right in the middle that
afternoon so it was like you couldn't
really get your day started but then
when I got home then it was like I felt
like I was behind so I said I couldn't
go back this year but I said that I
would still substitute so I've already
stopped once in the lunchroom and I also
said I could stop at the libraries
because I thought that would be fun so
yeah so I'm gonna stop I'm not like a
teacher I don't have a teaching degree
or anything like that it's considered
it's like and I still see it but I feel
like I felt like it was fun I was like I
can't come back full-time but I'll
totally come back inside with it so yeah
that's been fun um let's see I guess
curl up again okay um what palette am I
currently wearing I'm wearing the color
pop I love Sarah epal it's both of
mashiki and saucy Jodi Lynn says have
you ever considered writing children's
books I have but I don't know if I've
been good at it um I have but I don't
think that I don't think it would be
something that happens um some of it are
Oh
lastly um do I like cats I'm allergic to
cats so that's a bummer um let's see
well I try Halloween looks this year I
that really freaks me out because I'm
not that's not what I'm good at
like I'm not artistic at all I don't
know how people do these crazy
saying makeup looks I thought maybe I
think we talked about this last week in
the life but maybe like trying to
recreate someone else's look on camera
I'm sure it's gonna be a complete
disaster but I could try that but yeah
I'm just not I don't have that talent
I mean who it's crazy
Oh Cory says you love to finding her and
thank you that was my latest book thank
you thank you thank you
nano says what genre do you write and
what was your first book published also
I have five dogs
nice genre typically women's fiction at
my first book published was called
destined to fail I should know like
right off the top of my head what you
wrote was published but I don't remember
it's called destined to fail so 99 cents
on Amazon cuz it's a debut I feel like
you can tell my book is a debut there's
some debuts that you read and you're
like that's a debut novel but they're
seriously so money that you're like
that's their debut but like that's my
first book I feel like you can tell if
you buy my first book buy my last book
too hopefully you would be able to see a
see a boost a boost
let's see Melissa Kia says do you
allocate time each day to your book and
what time are you most effective usually
when I write and when I have like my
reading goals that I do I typically will
always write in the morning and then
typically when I film for YouTube I like
to use my natural light so I typically I
think I keep saying typically a book
like I usually film between like 1:00
and 3:00 but I film in the afternoon so
I just make sure to get my words in in
the morning but sometimes sometimes it
just depends to if I still don't have my
words right and like I'll stay up late
just to get it done things like that so
yeah yeah Katie says I'd love for
Samantha to try to recreate a Halloween
tutorial from a big beauty youtuber see
if they're even possible for us normal
Beauty girls I know and I think one of
my biggest problems with the Halloween
tutorials is that you have to go out and
buy all of us like read
Fila stuff like you see people with all
of these things and I'm like I don't
want to go by all of that because that's
expensive and I'm never going to use it
and I'm not gonna know how to do any of
this like I just feel like I feel
defeated even just thinking about it you
know just feel defeated thinking about
it like I feel like does he just posted
a photo of her Halloween tutorial that
she did and I was like how do you even
do stuff like that yeah I think Erik
well
BRB I think Ares has some things that
she's done huh hey
okay sorry done Thank You Candace for
sending Ares some treats to distract her
Aries has been like really bad the past
two weeks like she ate a bunch of my mac
lipsticks she went into my garbage can
the other day like things that she never
we've never had this issue since I mean
when she was a puppy yeah but the past
three and a half years we've had no
issues and all of a sudden she's like
horrible I don't know what is going on
with her it's just
does anybody whose dog she's four so
we're like what the heck
so we keep trying to think like do you
need a second dog to like calm down I
don't know it's just weird okay um where
was I Harris's are your books available
on Kindle yes Cheryl says are your books
a series they are not the book I'm
currently writing right now we'll be
book 1 in a series but all of my others
are standalone Susan says how do you
find time to use all the new makeup
products I have some money I forget
about others what I did is I have a
drawer and we're in the middle of
painting my office well we haven't
technically started but we've moved
everything out of my office but so I
don't know what it's gonna be like when
I put everything back in but I have a
drawer and that's where like an acrylic
case thing and I put everything in there
that I need to try out and that way it
helps me I can go right to there and be
like what is it that I'm needed to be
trying and then after I've used it for
sufficient amount of time or reviewed it
I go ahead and put it in into regular
spots okay feel like I was running to
try I don't know I I don't know what she
had but I feel like it was something she
could have been chewing on her antler
because it makes a loud noise but still
I just I just never know ah because he
says hi from lucky hello what's the best
thing about Iowa moving there soon in a
bit worried about winter you're moving
I am worrying the best thing is the best

Oh Kate I keep kind of getting confused
that where I'm being left off but yeah
okay I'm just reading through the
questions cuz I see some questions that
I've already answered Corey says she
does have makeup and fashion references
in her books kind of makes me feel
special like you know her on YouTube

feel like he I feel like he is because I
am able to like then like justify it you
know what I'm saying like I've always
been someone who's very into you know
turning passions into paychecks and and
all that stuff I did the same thing with
books I you know I buy books like a
crazy person as well and it kind of got
to the point where I started a book blog
and then I was like hey I didn't do you
know me write off all these books and
stuff and then you know eventually ended
up making an income from it which was
really fun and he's always like I need
to figure out how to do that because
he's got expensive hobbies like he can't
come after me no no no no he can't come
after me because his hobbies eyes
business so that's why I'm good Oh see

think I've heard both pretty positive
reviews on that one I personally do love
my morphe Jacqueline hell palette like
like I was saying I'm not a very
artistic person and like sometimes Oh
Kayleigh wasn't you guys doing here was
there watch one of your videos the other
day and you're talking about the scenes
in her palette you said you felt done
when you open
does he like some of you could figure
out what to do someone was saying that
in a video I remember hearing that and I
was like yes I totally like I totally
understand that because sometimes I do
open a pallet now I'm like I do but it's
like every time I open the morphe
chocolate hill I'm like excited no Mike
yes I'm doing that like that's that's
how I am with the more future content it
was Kelly okay that's how I am with the
mortgage on Hill and I appreciate that
so much because it's not fun to open a
pile and just be like what what do I do

Ellis bear says I have a very important
question why are you so pretty because
my mom is pretty my grandma was very
pretty
that's what I think oh let's see Jessica
says I made it hello just going Cheryl
says my husband doesn't ask me about
makeup and I don't ask him about of the
golf yeah
golf was expensive my husband likes to
golf and I'm like hello he also bowls
he's not a bowling league that's where
he's at right now he does lots of he has
lots of expensive hobbies have I tried
the new two-faced products I decided not
to get any Cory says my husband thought
I was cheating on him when I started
keeping into makeup that's not good
are you planning to do a makeup to turn
off the yes please palette that I just
purchased I actually did not purchase
the yes please proud
but yes please palette my friend Candace
to me which I'm so excited for and yes I
will have a special video coming up soon
and that will be featured in it and I
almost super excited about that
let's see Melissa says MIT should sell
some of his would work working projects
some of his woodworking projects yes but
also really likes to build things we
actually had a big discussion last night
about my dream vanity that he's going to
build me one of these days and yeah I
really want him to I got to convince him
I was like you should start an Etsy
store and he's like what Etsy Etsy is
for girl stuff I'm like no anybody can
sell anything on Etsy so I gotta
convince them I gotta convince him to do
that because yeah he's really I don't
know how he does it but he is pretty
darn that talented with that okay uh-huh
Haley says I have a villa hit Boxer mix
and the velcro is real how'd you get
areas to unstick when you need to be
without distractions oh you're writing
for me uh but yeah yeah one of the
reasons that we got a facial is we were
super interested in the Belle Perrault
term they're called the velcro Vizslas
which means they always want to be right
by their owners like Aries doesn't sit
by us she says honest if you follow me
on snap we're always sharing a chair
like she's always attached to us if I
need to stick her a lot of times I have
to like do a t word I can't say that
word she's right next to me she knows
what that means but I do a lot of like
peanut butter in the Kong's
and that kind of thing and she really
likes those I especially when I worked
for my hospital job I did work from home
but a lot of my job was phone calls and
she would get so upset when I had phone
calls because it was like I wasn't
paying enough attention to her ass on
the phone so I would have to do peanut
butter in the column all the time it's
super annoying but that's like really
the only way I can get her to leave me
alone for a bit and jelly says maybe you
could try a cute Halloween tutorial
instead of something
be like mermaid makeup I thought it may
be doing mermaid because I feel like
that's like it's a most simple
no I'm gonna put you in your cage that's
what I'm gonna do you gotta chill out
look at people that come to watch you
whine girlfriend um
but yeah maybe a mermaid or something
like in my mind I was like maybe I could
do that melting skull thing that does he
dead now I'm like great you were not
doing no melting skull what did you talk
about girl yeah calm down
I Elise is here Hey oh man least I'm

think is her name she's a Victoria's
Secret model totally 100% see that one
but one time I used to work at a massage
clinic and it had like big windows in
the front and then it was like in a part
of a strip mall and there was a woman
walking by the window and you know I was
kind of like looking out the window and
I could see her and like we made eye
contact and she was like and she runs in
and I'm like oh my gosh what was
happening and she's like oh oh I thought
you were
for instance I got so excited I'm like
why would jennifer aniston be behind a
desk at a Des Moines massage that's

fiance is a mechanic tools are so
expensive plus he likes to buy stuff for
his own vehicle - of course yeah
seriously and because how I said like
Mitch likes to do like the woodworking
and stuff those tools are so expensive
and he has a lot and I'm like and I'm
like that's why I'm like you need to
sell yourself
but you need to pay back those do cool
it's crazy
oh man Oh see Cheryl says my husband is
good with building things too but it
always seems he's doing something for
other people instead of stuff for our

I used the website Crocker is what it's
called and because I just forgot from
home I don't go to a gym or like have a
trainer or anything and it just has all
these different workout videos that you
can do and I like to do I don't know I
like to do anything
I mean yoga's yoga's like my first love
so I practiced yoga everyday but I
usually I took I don't really need like
a workout video for that because I just
do like my poses and stuff but I like
you know cardio kickboxing is really fun
to do pull out these things like that
so yeah but I used that website because
I like having I like being able to to
watch and follow along I'm not the
greatest I like coming up with them
myself
- y'all go because I know you'll go
really well some of the other ones I'm
not the greatest at like putting moves
together and things like that so I like
to watch those videos let's see
Perris don't rock over the camera and of
course I what do you think the Casey
Holmes new boutique I'm so excited I
think that's really cool
I'm excited to see everything I know ice
on our snapchat
like having a party and I was like I
want to go to the party but it's in
Georgia like next week and I'm like
that's not gonna work for me I'm not
even close to Georgia well so because I
would be really cool to go to but I'm
excited um I definitely want to get a
few things I tweeted his other days like
make sure you order lots of these
because she said in her snap like what
do you guys really excited for us I can
order more and so I let her know which
ones I had my eye on so yeah I think
that's super cool I know that she's
always said that she's wanted to do
something like that so I think that's
awesome of her so really excited for I
love I love KC pho shows on pumps um
let's see what KC almost petit kissing
home so starting a boutique it's called
is it rose rosey and days or gazing Rose
sits with her her dogs names basically
she's gonna be like a buyer so she's
gonna buy from other like stores or
brands or like things like that and then
sell him sell them and her boutique and
it'll be like online and everything so
you can buy clothes food there so I'm
pretty stoked about that I know she's
got an Instagram page already and I
think a Facebook page - so kandi says if
you could live anywhere where and why if
I do have any where where and why I
definitely would want to live in just a
warmer state I do not deal with cold
well and I get seasonal depression
really bad in the winter time because we
will go for days here in Iowa without
any sunshine and it just like messes
with my mind like it can get really bad
one year it was it was actually it was
actually really bad so I would just
somewhere warm like just somewhere warm
all all the time I'm not picky picky

geez Kati what does my moderator Kati is
doing big things tonight goodness
gracious
Janie wasn't it last week that I asked
how it went and you were like you didn't
have to do anything right like I didn't
I thought I remember you saying like you
didn't even lead anybody like everything
was cool oh my goodness
then I got another night like this poof
if you guys aren't subscribed to Katy's
channel you should she's my moderator
she's here every single Thursday and
some weeks are like this where she's
like she's so on the ball doing amazing
things so I think if you just click on
her name
yeah cases last week I didn't do
anything this week nope if you got her
neighbors should say cute dirty idols
she's got a really awesome Instagram to
it so make sure you check that out also
I'm Lea says do you have any other goals
like a clothing line or my own makeup
I've never really been interested in
doing a like makeup line because I'm not
very like that seems really hard
nothing's really tough I would I've
always been interested in doing
something with clothing though
especially like Fitness wear because
that's what I wear so much I would love
to do something with like athletic wear
but I'm also really interested in
marketing I've always been interested in
you know starting like a PR firm or
marketing firm or something like that
it's something that I still think about
and I work on every once in a while if I
have downtime I can't I'm like a
business plan type of thing but I don't
know we'll see that's where that's where
I feel like my expertise would be better
because I
worked in marketing and PR for so many
years though lisa says wow this is my
first time in a live chat your mother is
working hard I know some I feel I feel
like maybe maybe we can D we should just
expect every other week like expect it
every other week it's gonna be crazy
I'm Lea stuffs would you ever move to
California for your career
I don't know mmm I mean I don't know
that would be tough I don't know that I
don't know that I don't know how excited
Mitch would meet see that move he's not
really like a big city kind of dude
that'd be weird seeing him there but I
don't I don't know if I would move there
la seems very uh I don't know mm-hmm I
think it would be hard going from the
Midwest this summer like LA it just
seems interesting and sometimes I talked
to my friends who were out there and
things like that and it seems like a
different different world different
world oh let's see okay okay sorry iris
it skips around every once in a while so
I have to like scroll back up and stuff
um Brittany says youtuber PR firm would
be awesome yeah maybe someday I think
that would be pretty cool
I have a lot of different ideas but I
don't know actually putting them into
play I would probably be difficult
um do I speak any languages that I was
in English I do not I took French in
high school and I found it was really
hard I guess we get to find a bit of
French and a tiny bit of Spanish and
that is it Leah says what is the most
exciting thing that has happened to you
so far being a youtuber I mean there's
so many exciting things that have
happened so many exciting things just so
many like fun friendships like that's
been really cool just getting able to to
meet and become friends with so many
other like-minded people I mean that's a
reason why
I start at my book blog back in 2009
which is what started my furry into
social medias I just wanted to be able
to talk to people that were interested
in the same things as me because I don't
really get that in my real life the time
and that's a big reason to you know
starting YouTube and then being able to
start to talk about makeup and beauty
because I don't have a ton of like my
girlfriends in real life you're like you
know I'm sure they like makeup and
they'll do it but you know it's not a
passion for them like it is for me so
it's really fun to to be able to talk to
other people and and just kind of
connect that way you know I think I know
and I say this a lot but like you know
social media obviously gets a ton of
flack and there's you know there's a lot
of negativity and there's a lot of hard
things on here but at the same time
there really is so many positives to it
and definitely one of them is the
friendships that you can make I think
that's pretty darn cool as though how do
I play any musical instruments I do not
I did play a piano in like elementary
school middle school I think was
elementary school or not Dessie piano
violin guys if you I'm a violin know
what youtubers have I met I have not met
anyone in person I live in Iowa so I
don't really feel like I can't you know
there's a lot of times in LA cuz I I get
emails from my Kip CEOs and stuff that
are like oh Thirsty Thursday event
tonight and coverfx is hosting a party
just RSVP and you can go and I'm like oh
mm-hmm no one's having parties in the
Midwest oh I would like to work on that
because we get left out for everything
so that's always a big bummer um let's
see
Kelly says I agree building
relationships is the best part of
YouTube Oh show Brittany says that's a
full moon which means the creeps are up
looks funny is it a full moon well Kelly
says did you have a good experience
using 23andme I've been wanting to do it
but I want to make sure it's money
well-spent I did if you guys aren't
familiar 23andme is what would you call
it like a DNA test so
my biological father is a sperm donor so
my mom actually bought me a 23andme kit
when I turned 30 back in March to do so
I could learn some information about my
biological father since we don't really
have anything on him and it was pretty
cool to see you know origins because you
know obviously we were able to pinpoint
because you know I know my mom and her
side of the family so we knew you know
that she was German but then you know so
the other ones we kind of got to figure
things out from there like I found out
that I am also Native American like what
I wouldn't have guessed that that was
pretty cool um so yeah I thought it was
pretty interesting I just did the one
that that cost the least amount of money
I didn't do the real expensive one
because it just had some information in
there that I didn't think I need it I
really just kind of wanted to get my
ancestry and you know just kind of see
where I was from so that was pretty cool
and how we found out that he is French
British Finnish Eve American yeah don't
we yes I know we know what you are ace
so yeah that was pretty fun I enjoyed
doing it so I would recommend it if you
want to you know find out your ancestry
I thought that was pretty neat and I
know that there's more things that you
can do in there like you can actually
set up to have it alert you if someone
works like basically like DNA match you
so I signed up for that because since my
father is a sperm donor you know there's
probably you know I probably have
siblings out there cipollinis I don't
know kind of a loose term but so I would
I would totally be interested if I never
if there's ever like a match that pops
open there I would totally be interested
in meeting someone so yeah that's me but
so we're at 52 minutes so I'm probably
gonna try to start winding down here
since it's been almost an hour I can't
believe how fast that went like my lives
typically go really fast for me but that
was like really really fast
ever since did your mom raised you by
herself she remarried when I was pretty
young
how how old I was but um she eventually
did remarry and had my little brother
they did eventually divorce though so
it's typically just just me and my mom I
think I felt really old today when on my
time habit said Gilmore Girls did that
first episode like was it 17 not
something it could have been 17 years
ago 10 years ago 10 years 10 years go
Gilmore Girls came out because mom and I
always watched that together okay
Oh a lot of you guys have done the
answer sheet says that's really cool
yeah I I mean even if it's not something
you know like you're in my situation
you're just curious about your ancestry
I mean it really pinpointed it down I
gave you percentages and everything was
pretty cool so I enjoyed doing it let's
see it's skipped her on me again but
Ashley says what company do you not
currently receive PR but you would like
to know what Becca would be cool like
Mecca yeah I think that's the same thing
um I mean I mean really honey I mean I
get so excited every time I open a box
it's it's always like super surreal to
me that brands know this and yeah I mean
I've that's a really weird feeling
that's definitely been something that's
been very exciting oh yeah yeah that
would be for proof Chris chief I want to
send me no shadows
no I'm just kidding um but yeah that's
been something that's been super
exciting to you know these brands that
I've been using especially the ones that
and I've been using for so many years
and and you know and you know I have a
big collection of just to be noticed by
them not even that they even have to
send me anything but like
I'm back sorry it kicked me out I don't
I'm not fifty five minutes I should
probably uh follow up or follow up here
I should probably wrap it up here um but
yeah that's always really cool like even
if they like something on my Instagram
or anything like that
um that's really really cool so um since
YouTube yeah I'm really gonna go ahead
and wrap things up here but I will be
back next Thursday I feel like I always
have to think if I'm like doing
something but I'm really never doing
anything so I will be back next Thursday
at 7:30 CST for another live if you
