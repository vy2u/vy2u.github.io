today's video I'm very excited for it's
going to be a first impressions video
some swatches and a demo using the new
lorac Pro I love brunch
palette I am so excited this is my first
lorac palette so I'm super stoked about
it
a lot of you guys have been recommending
lorac to me thing that I need to try
their eyeshadows and when I saw the
brunch palette come out it just caught
my eye I love the pastels I thought it
was super unique I love brunch so I gave
it a check mark and yes category of if I
should get this one I put it in a win
light video and I said I was going to
buy it I also put lorac in the seven
brands that I want to try video and I
even said in their eye purchases palette
and I was just waiting on it I just got
it in the mail I knew it was coming
today and I've been waiting around and
waiting around I don't have any eye
makeup on my face is done but I don't
have any eye makeup because I want to
actually put these on my eyes and see
what we get so I just got it I haven't
watched it I just opened it up and
looked at it and it looks beautiful I'm
super excited about this so I'm going to
go through I'm going to do some swatches
and then like I said I'm also going to
do a demo and see what kind of eye luck
we can get with this I'm not great like
just disclaimer and that great eyes
doing swatches on camera I find it
really difficult actually so I'll be
including clips of the swatches on my
hand or on my arms or you know even like
video clips of the swatches so you can
get a better idea of it but I'm going to
go through a swatch of it try it on my
eyes and just kind of give you guys my
first impression so I'm excited for it
this was $44 I got mine at Ulta in the
box it came with the lorac behind the
scenes eye primer which is an eyeshadow
primer and then it does also come with a
double-ended brush for this video I'm
not going to use either one of these
because I've never used them before so
like just in case I don't love the
shadows I don't need to like blame it on
the browser should blame it on the
primer you know what I mean I'm going to
use my like regular items that I would
normally use so I can you know try this
give the best feedback that I can but
when you open it up you do have the
mirror right here and then all of your
shade
they look so beautiful but to be honest
when I got it like I said I've never
used lorac shadows I've never owned one
of their eyeshadow palettes and honestly
was kind of smaller than I was expecting
I'm not sure why I don't know if maybe I
was thinking like I know they really
liked how I don't know if that's what I
was thinking I was going to get but it
is definitely small and more compact but
it also has the nice mirror so right
away I'm thinking like this could be
good to travel with to do a size
comparison this is the lorac and then
the tartlets in baloon palette so it's
definitely bigger than the tartlet in
bloom the tartlet and bloom shadows
you'll love to be quite a bit bigger
than the lorac brunch but there is a
little bit of idea of the comparison so
you can get an idea the shadows are
definitely smaller in here but they're
spaced far enough apart that I don't
think there would be an issue putting
your brush into it sometimes if the
shadow pans are smaller and they're so
close together it's kind of hard to get
your brushes in there and I was just
kind of a mess though I like the layout
the names are absolutely hysterical hot
sauce avocado toast french toast
blueberry scones Bloody Mary like oh my
gosh I haven't no I'm so excited you
guys like this is what I get from doing
a first impression like I'm just like
pumped I'm so pumped Oh first impression
just looking at it like I said I thought
it was a little bit smaller I don't know
why I was just thinking and be a little
bit bigger but it's not like teeny tiny
I'm not like disappointed in the size it
just that was like a an observation I
know straight away I like to lay out the
shades look really beautiful why don't
we go ahead and do some swatches first
and then I'll finish off with the eyelid
zoomed in a little bit but let's just go
ahead and get started with the swatches
so I'm just going to swatch by row so
we're going to start off with the first
row we have lavender eggs bunny
gluten-free and hot sauce okay so there
are some swatches so this one is
lavender oh that's really light is eggs
Benny
okay that one's a little bit better I
guess
this one is gluten-free and then the
last one is hot sauce okay okay so I
mean I'll insert some better swatches in
here I will say that I noticed there was
a lot of fallout right away but I don't
know
um the lavender I mean it's very pastel
it's very light very pastel eggs bunny
I mean egg is burning and gluten-free
both didn't look too bad gluten-free
definitely has yeah you can see
gluten-free really well that's just one
swatch that is like a nice white shimmer
shade but you know hot sauce didn't do
much either hot sauce and under there
both are really really light so I'll be
curious to see how these actually do on
the eyes but yeah the pastels were
definitely super pastels
gluten-free was the winner out of the
top round let's go onto the second row
in the second row we have jelly donut
which is a matte pale pink we have
pancake which is a shimmer cream sorbet
which is a matte dusty mauve and then
the last one is of Vallet which is a
matte light grey so there are the
swatches on my finger so this one is
jelly donut and then we have pancakes
and we have sorbet I was really hoping
that one would show up more and then the
last one is ballet okay so there is the
second row of swatches so jelly doughnut
is definitely a very light pink pancakes
again it's light but it still looks
great like I don't know I'm gonna I mean
definitely I need to see how these do my
eyes this is serious I mean this is
first impression I haven't even had this
palette for 20 minutes my shades though
they still look really pretty so I'm
very curious how they do on the eyes
like even though they're softer shades
it's not freaking me out yet yes
pancakes it looks nice that one actually
did swatch okay even though it's pretty
light sorbet
I was hoping sorbet would watch a little
bit better because
I love like the mob shape but that one
that one didn't swatch super great and
then valet was another one that wasn't
too good say the winner of row two is
definitely going to be pancake hmm okay
so that's okay I mean jelly donut now
that I'm looking at jelly donut again
let me see if I can build a swatch up
now I tried to build it build up jelly
donut a little bit more again hopefully
I'm inserting some swatches so you can
get a better idea but right now we'll
have to see let's move on to the third
row in the third row we have Bloody Mary
which is a shimmer coral we have
blueberry scone which is a matte
sky-blue and then we have moonlight
which is a shimmer pastel Gold and then
the last one is avocado toast which is a
matte seafoam okay so here are the
swatches so I mean these are just on my
freaking fingertips but I feel like they
already look more promising so I don't
know here we go let's try it out here is
Bloody Mary hmm okay and then we have
blueberry scone okay that one's shown up
okay okay and then we have moonlight ooh
okay and then we have avocado toast
oh yes avocados toast this was the one
that I really wanted to that was the one
that I really wanted to see you guys I
feel like I almost bought that palette
off of avocado toast I thought that one
was so cool so these swatches Bloody
Mary didn't do so well I will say that
Bloody Mary didn't do great blueberry
scone that's looking promising that's a
really cool blue like I kind of want to
put that all over my lid moonlight
showed up really good the shimmer shade
yep moonlight was looking good and an
avocado toast did show up as well again
these are just like swatches for me to
get an idea of over two real quick
swatches I'm going to insert better one
bird row is probably the most promising
row and then blueberry scone and avocado
toast and moonlight I mean this was this
was a good row that's coming just got me
feeling better so let's go ahead and do
the final row this row we have mimosa
which is a matte
sell peach and then we have smoothie
which is a shimmer lilac and then we
have french toast which is a shimmer
gray bronze and then we have sundae
sundae which is a shimmer peach rose it
is a good amount of maps and shimmers in
here again obviously this is a pastel
palette so the shades are very pastel
they are very light but here is the last
four swatches honestly those look pretty
good too
so here we go okay so here is mimosa and
then we have smoothie so let's move
these pretty and then we have french
toast
okay french toast okay and then we have
sundae sundae
okay so there is the last row of
swatches those wires weren't too bad
smoothie and french toast stuck out to
me right away those ones don't they
don't look too bad so alright alright so
yep that is the last row swatches movie
and french toast definitely stuck out to
me the most I'm also not too bad either
but the last shade sundae Funday that
one wasn't doing a whole lot that might
be a good like blending out color but
overall just doing my swatches like my
first impression on my swatches before
before putting them on my eyes or
anything I think one thing that will be
really important is that you know this
is a pastel palette in a very light
palette if you like bold colors and
really creating bold makeup look this
one is definitely not going to be for
you like you have to want these types of
shades to get excited about this palette
one thing that excited me about it is
that I didn't feel like I had anything
in my collection like specifically like
this haven't loved super light palette
in the past I'm immediately thinking of
the Too Faced white chocolate chip
palette and then also the Smashbox the
little palette I think is called soft
light I didn't love those palettes they
were very light shades well the Too
Faced white chocolate chip let's just
throw that out because you guys know
that I hated that palette but the
Smashbox soft light palette I didn't
think was about
palate but I said you needed to
specifically really like those colors
and really create soft looks and ended
up being not for me because I felt like
I couldn't do enough with it and it was
all shimmers whereas this one has mass
shimmers transitions colors neutrals
like this to me I think it's going to
suit me better than the Smashbox soft
light if that makes sense I hope that it
does but before I can really give a good
first impression like yay or nay how I'm
feeling I'm going to go ahead and grab
some brushes and we're going to see what
we can come up with a foreign eyelid not
you guys
zoomed in again I'm going to take my
morphe m4 for one brush it's just a
really big blending brush I'm going to
use mimosa down here and I'm just going
to apply this into my crease
it's just acting as a very light
transition color it might be a little
bit too pale like for what I normally do
as a transition but honestly I don't
think it's bad especially with the look
that we're going to create obviously
it's going to be very pastel so I think
this will be a fine transition
transition that shade then I'm going to
grab my Sigma e25 and this Bloody Mary
I want to see how this one goes so I'm
just going to place this in like the
outer V of my eye
initially hopefully the camera is
picking up what I'm seeing this isn't
bad it's showing up and it looks really
pretty
oh I'm not not at this no no no matter
schedule then I'm going to grab my Sigma
e 54 and I'm going to pick up avocado
toast because I've been dying to try the
shade and I'm going to place this on the
inner part of my eyelid
oh yes avocado toast give it to me I
don't even like avocado toast but I need
to rethink that I I seriously like
sometimes the camera can't pick things
up well enough especially it's so bright
outside and we have snow on the ground
when I'm telling you guys this one looks
beautiful you people love it love it
love it love the shade I'm so excited
like I said like this was I feel like
one of like the 2 to 3 shades then I
thought that I was really excited about
from this palette and it's got me
it applies I mean it didn't spot bad by
any means but it applies to the eyes so
much better like I don't even feel like
you need to go back in I felt like even
just one dip did it that's awesome I'm
going to blend that out real quick with
the e25 just kind of merge those
together so I noticed that there was
fallout when I was watching but there
hasn't been any fallout on my face yet
so that's a good sign okay I've only use
two shades on my eyes so far but so far
so good
apply like a pastel lavender lilac shade
in my waterline real quick this is
crybaby from colour-pop then because I
put lilac in the waterline I'm going to
pick up a lavender and smudge this on
the lower lash line I'm gonna use my
morphe e36 for this we're going to see
like this shade has a lot fallout we'll
see if I get Saul out on my face I'm
gonna place this on my lower lash line
this one has a lot of fallout because I
can feel it like going into my eye that
doesn't feel great
so lavender I didn't think to watch
great and I don't think
I don't think I don't think it's bad but
it's definitely not proud of toast and
it's not even bloody marys like I think
it's just it's pretty light but it
doesn't look bad i think combines with
the crybaby liner it makes it pop a
little bit more but it's definitely a
pretty light shade like I don't think
this would be even enough to wear like
over the eyelids anything this might
just have to be a lower lashline color
but not bad but the fallout is pretty
extreme you get a lot of what feels like
the eyeshadow in your eye so oh I don't
do inner corner highlight a ton but I'm
going to grab french toast and my morphe
e 18 and I'm going to see what this
looks like as an inner corner highlight
hmmm that's actually not too bad I don't
mind that
that's French toast as the inner corner
highlight that's not bad guys I quite
like that so that's cool I like the way
that looks so there we go I want to try
out another shade and I'm going to pop
on some lashes I'm not going to do any
top liner because I don't want to take
away from the look but I am just going
to apply some lashes real quick and then
lower lash mascara and then I'll be back
so I went ahead and finished off my eyes
and then this is the final look that I
came up with I also finally put some lip
pop icon as well and also lipstick on
before I had my eyes finished because I
thought it would just be weird but this
is the eye look that I came up with I
did add some lashes because that's
that's just normally what I do I'm
actually I'm way more excited about how
the ILO's turned out then I was about
the initial swatches I wasn't quite sure
what we were going to get but I was
really happy again I used a Bloody Mary
avocado toast lavender and French toast
and I'm I'm excited for it I'm excited
to keep using these shades I think
definitely what I'm kind of getting as a
first impression is that there's going
to be hit and misses in here which is
very common with eyeshadow palettes you
know out of most of my eyeshadow
palettes I would say 90% of my palettes
there's at least one shade in there that
I don't like I mean even up to like four
to five shades in there that I don't
like I think this one is going to be no
exception you know like the lavender it
didn't swatch super great and it
definitely was very pale when I was
putting it on my under eyes but overall
I think I'm going to still enjoy it I
think I'm going to get some good looks
out of it I'm glad that I didn't just do
swatches because I think I probably
would have been a lot more disappointed
how I just done swatches I'm actually
putting them on my eyes you know I think
that they look that I think that they
look pretty good definitely the next
look I do is going to be with
blueberries go until I can't wait to put
that one on my eyes as well but I wanted
to use a shimmer to see what a shimmer
looks like so that's why I put it in my
inner corner and I really like the way
french-toast
came out so I'm really excited about
this palette I'm excited to play with it
more let me know if you guys want to see
