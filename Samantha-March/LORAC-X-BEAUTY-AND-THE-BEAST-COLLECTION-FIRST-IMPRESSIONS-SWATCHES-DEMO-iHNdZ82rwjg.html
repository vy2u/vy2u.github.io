I'm so excited for today's video because
I am finally finally getting to play
with the lorac cosmetics and a beauty
and beast collection finally so these
were all sent to me from lorac cosmetics
which is absolutely incredible I was so
oh my gosh I was so excited when I open
up the package and saw the beauty of the
beast boxes I thought no way on Twitter
what you guys would want to see with
this video and you guys said you wanted
to see like a first impression Tryon so
that is what we're going to be doing
it's been so hard not to play with these
we wanted to go with what the majority
suggested and give you my first
impression thoughts and how I'm feeling
about everything and if I would
recommend it so I'm very excited to hop
into these before we get started I want

right now for YouTube and then also over
on my Instagram so those will be linked
down below but why don't we go ahead and
get started with the erupted and Beauty
and the Beast collection so of course
I'm going to kick it off with the
eyeshadow palette so I do have a
foundation concealer and brows already
done and then I'm going to start with
the eye shadow palette this is what the
outer box looks like and then when you
open it up this packaging is just so
amazing so it's probably gonna make my
lighting look weird but this is what it
looks like and you open it up here and
then you have your shades it also does
come with a double-ended brush and it
has the mirror over here it says true
beauty is found within over here and
this packaging is oh my gosh it's just
amazing I love beauty in the Beast I
went and saw the new movie I thought it
was fantastic but Beauty and the Beast
was always one of my absolute favorites
I was Belle for Halloween as a little
girl though the eyeshadow palette is
going to be $48 here is a close-up of
what the shades look like so the
eyeshadow palette is $48 it is available
on the lorac and Aalto website right now
so I will have some links down below but
I think trying to decide
what type of look I want to do it's
going to be really hard for me not to
play with these Pink's because play just
I'm just really attracted to them so I
think that's what I'm going to go ahead
and do so I'm just going to prime my
eyes grab some brushes and we'll get
started
I have my ELF primer on so I'm first
going to dip into this chip in shade and
I'm going to use my Real Techniques
deluxe concealer brush I'm just going to
run this all over my eye has a base
shade so this is the brush that comes
with the palette so I'm going to go
ahead and try it and first use more of
like be blending side of the brush and
let's see I'm going to go into this
tik-tok shade here on the bottom and I'm
going to put that into my crease
I just mentioned this in it was my
latest get ready with me about how I
tend not to swatch things a lot like I
just go ahead and like dive right in
when I'm creating makeup looks because I
saw what the no swatch challenge is
going around and I'm doing it once again
with this
I have knots watched these shades at all
she is really pretty it's like a light
kind of involved transition shade and
I've been playing more and more with
different colors in the crease instead
of always just doing a brown like I
would normally do and I really like the
shade I think it's really pretty going
to take a shade right above it it is
called romance and I'm going to use the
same end of the brush and just kind of
lightly work this into the outer part of
my eye for a little bit of extra
dimension here it's going to be a little
bit darker cuz it kind of looks pretty
dark in the pan I mean I did tap my
brush pretty lightly but I think it's
blending out really well it looks really
pretty
use the other end of the brush and I
come into this last shade here which is
called real you if it looks to be like a
pink shimmer and I'm going to apply this
all over the lid
the shade does have some glitter in it
listen silver glitter I'm seeing but
it's not like super glittery or super
overwhelming the follow like I'm getting
some along my face but not anything too
bad something that looks really pretty a
lot of my camera was cooling down and
went ahead and added just a little bit
of a liner and then popped on the pure
diva lashes because it says they're kind
of like romantic lashes and the pink is
giving me like date nights I obsess it
and then I also put a bit of the appear
on point liner in my waterline before I
finish out the eyes I'm going to go
ahead and swatch all the shades on my
hand so we can see what they look like
I'll swatch it out so I'm just going to
go row by row so this is the first row
we have dream it and then we have time
keeper the next one is our guest and
then the last one is impressed this
first one is no joke that is called
dream it I was not expecting that
I'm humor is kind of like a shimmer hope
our guest it's kind of like a almost
like a muted navy blue I would say and
then impressed is kind of like that
eggplant purple shade there is the first
row and then here is the second row of
swatches so we have beast mode and then
enchanting and then this is swept up oh
and that is look beyond so here is that
second row Oh beast mode is like no joke
I'm so excited to use that color and
chanting off of these shimmers are
swatching really really nice but swept
up that is black I mean it has shimmer
in it but that is black there's a lot of
black shimmers I think there's even one
in the Pirates of the Caribbean I shadow
palette from lorac but this that looks
really really nice and then the last one
is a look beyond which is kind of a
matte pale brown there is a swatches
from the second row here is the third
row of swatches so we have my castle and
then
have shipped in and then we have romance
and then the last one is spell breaker
Wow Wow Wow
I'm actually a lot of WordPress but
they've got just that I maybe thought I
was going to be and I'm just getting a
lot of ideas for more looks I could do I
knew I wanted to do pink
with this palette because even before I
had the palette the Pink's attracted me
the most but still from these swatches
I'm getting a lot of different ideas a
different looks to create this row
really impresses me chipping is what I
put all over the lid it's just a nice
matte white shade you know not the most
exciting color in a palette but one that
I do reach for often myself this my
castle is a beautiful shimmer bronze in
black you also really impressed me
romance is what I have on the outer v of
my eyes with this spell breaker I mean
it reminds me a lot of swept up except
this is more of like a deep brown it's
not black at all Tamar with a deep brown
but then it has the glitter in it as
well but Wow okay
okay okay and then this is the last row
of swatches so we have inner beauty and
then we have tea time and then this one
is kick top and then we have real you so
those are the swatches from the last row
again I'm still attracted to the last
row I just thought it was really soft
and romantic and really pretty here are
the swatches so inner beauty is a matte
light pink tea time I actually thought
it was like a silver gray but swatched
out it has a pink undertone to it as
well and then tick tock is what I have
in the crease and real you is what I
have all of the lid it is a pink shade
it does have glitter in it but again
these are really pretty these swatches
have me very impressed and I'm actually
much more inspired to play with this
palette than I originally thought it was
going to be I just put this palette in
awhile I buy it I put the entire
collection in a will I buy it
item that was interested in getting was
the cheek palate and I actually had it
in my car that also was going to buy it
when the collection showed up which was
super exciting to me but actually
smashing this out now I am much more
inspired to play with these again some
palettes swatched great and don't
perform on the eyes well but already
having a few of these shades on my eyes
and seeing how well they did work on the
eyes I'm feeling - pretty good vibes
right now and that's really exciting to
me so those are some swatches from the
palette but why don't we go ahead get
back into the toriel and finish off the
eyes for my lower lashline I'm just
going to take some of romance and I'm
also going to mix it with look beyond
which is just just the matte Brown and
push this onto the lower lash line I'm
using the detailed lip brush the lo4
from Sigma the lip brush but you know I
like to use it for my lower lash line no
rules no rules for my brow bone
highlight I'm going to use this first
shade right here which was called dream
it because that looked absolutely
beautiful when you use my morphe e 18
then for my inner corner I'm actually
going to put some of this inner beauty
on there because I just thought that
color was really cool as well I'm just
going to go ahead and see what this
looks like it's not maybe a traditional
in your corner color but I was really
feeling it after i swatched it and I
think that was very pretty on the inner
corner add some mascara to my lower
lashes this is the Catrice rocket or
extreme Volume Mascara I just used it in
my latest get ready with me so it's just
sitting here on my desk so I'm just
going to pop these on my lower lashes to
finish up the eyes so this is the final
look for the eyes let me know what you
guys think of the shade that I use and
how you thought they perform I have to
say I am a lot more impressive this
eyeshadow palette than I thought I was
going to be for some reason I just was
not drawn to it when I was looking at it
which really surprised me because I'm
such a beauty in the Beast fan I thought
that I would be able to talk myself into
this no problem but I don't know if it
was just maybe the shade selection
wasn't quite like what I thought maybe
it was going to be and I don't know I
just I wasn't feeling it but after
watching it and after
out multiple shades on my eyes I'm
actually very very impressed with it and
I'm really inspired to create a few more
looks at this so I'm pretty excited
about this palette I'm not going to live
a little demo helped out and then also
the swatches let me know what your
thoughts are on the eyeshadow palette
down below it is $48 or let me know if
you guys have it already in what you
think of it but with the eyes done when
I will go ahead and jump into the cheek
palette so excited about the next we're
going to jump into the cheek palette
this is what the outer packaging looks
like and then inside I have left the
packaging of this too this is what it
looks like it has Beauty and the Beast
on the front and then when you open it
up you have four different shades and
also a really nice mirror and the quote
on this one is she was fearless which I
just love so here is a close-up of the
shades I'll just go through and swatch
each one real quick here before we jump
into them these feels super super soft
and smooth so here are those swatches so
we have see beyond and then we have
fearless and then we have enchanted and
then we have rose I apologize for my
ratchet nails I need to get a new set
put on and I absolutely hate getting
nails taken off to put a new set on I'm
just like literally too scared to go the
nail salon too painful so that's where
I'm at right now but those are the
swatches from the cheek outs obviously
we have the three bushes here and then a
very gold highlight and the blushes are
different shades of pink so if you don't
like pink blushes and you don't like a
gold highlighter don't don't buy this
palette because this is not going to be
for you but the Pink's look really nice
this first one looks to have a bit of a
shimmer to it the other one looks to be
more of a matte pale pink and then the
last one is a deeper pink with some
shimmer as well of course the highlight
is gold so I realized I didn't have any
bronzer on yet so I just added some
bronzer quick but the cheek palette is
$28 for the four different shades and
the pan sizes are pretty large and then
you get the mirror in there also from
the Pirates of the Caribbean collection
I'll say that I was most excited to try
the eye shadow palette but I actually
end up using the cheek palette all of
the time
those highlights and there are BOM and
the blush in there is super super good I
do think it's kind of interesting with
this one because in the Pirates of the
Caribbean we had six shades but I think
four of them were highlights and two or
blushes and this one we get the four
shades with three blushes and one
highlight so a little bit of a contrast
there but I'm going to go ahead and jump
into this third shade here which is
enchanted which is the kind of pale pink
and I'm using the Sigma large angled
contour brush the f40 it's one of my
favorite blush brushes and that is
really pigmented well I just lightly
tapped my brush in there I honestly was
so impressed with that Pirates of the
Caribbean cheek palette that's why I
wanted this the most when I was
initially deciding if I was going to buy
anything from this collection I mean I
just lightly tapped my brush in there
and look how beautiful that is
it's seriously so impressed with the
lorac blushes and highlights and I'm
already excited about this guy so after
the like smallest blush application in
the world I have beautiful pink cheeks
now whoo that's pretty if I'm going to
try the gold highlight which is fearless
I'm going to use my pixie double-ended
brush I'm going to use the strobe side
full highlights you used to freak me out
until I tried Prosecco pop from Becca
and Jacqueline Hill and was like why
have I been scared school highlights I
think people say that if you have
lighter skin tones like you can't work
whole highlights and I say no I say no
that I know rules and if you like how
bold how it looks on you but you go
ahead and do it so I'm going to go ahead
and oh my again I tapped so lightly
thinking that this is going to be pretty
pigmented and it is oh that is so pretty
just going to do my cheekbones with this
one with a gold highlight I don't always
do the like my nose and Cupid's bow and
stuff I just don't love the way that
gold looks on the center of my face I
prefer it just for my cheekbones that is
so pretty I mean it reminds me of the
exact formula from the Pirates of the
Caribbean supersoft doesn't show a lot
of texture just a really nice solid
highlight Oh yep yep
yep I'm liking this palette just as much
as I thought I was going to I really
thought I was going to and I am not
disappointed so there is the blush and
highlight on my face thumbs up for me I
like I said I was planning to purchase
this cheek palette mostly because of how
much I love the Pirates of the Caribbean
one and I thought I would get a lot of
use out of this one with all of these
beautiful blushes and I really liked
that gold highlight which there wasn't a
gold highlight in the Pirates of the
Caribbean one and I have to say that I
love this I do not think $28 is a bad
price for these four big pans so yeah
yeah this one this one gets a thumbs up
for me loving it alright so then the
final two items in the collection are
the lipsticks and then the lip glosses
but each one has five different products
in here six are $36 for five and the lip
glosses are $34 for five different
shades
I'm not going to swatch all of them
because some of them I know that I
wouldn't wear a ton so I could put them
in a giveaway but I'll pick out some of
my favorites in here at swatch them and
then I'm going to do a lipstick and then
lipgloss combo on my list to finish off
the look so moving on to the lipstick
this is what the outer packaging looks
like I will say that this packaging to
me kind of feels a little bit cheap and
I actually thought the same thing about
the Pirates of the Caribbean lipstick
which is kind of interesting to me it
does say Beauty on the Beast Beauty and
the Beast on the side here too and then
lorac on that side I don't know yeah the
packaging just feels a little like
ostomy and these are kind of hard to
click back into place like they don't
just easily click because I've been
picking them up after I've been watching
them and I'm dropping them because the
lid doesn't click down all the way but I
pulled out three that I liked the most
so this one is in the shade true beauty
is this one right here so that one is a
really beautiful pale pink and then the
next one that I swash is called belly's
so kind of a twist on the leaves so
there is what a belly looks like and
that is the middle one it's watched here
so just a deeper pink here iPhone is
favored fair I'm sure I'm saying that
wrong
no quite often say about one but here is
what that one looks like and then here
is this swatch so that one is actually
more of a peachy tone which I actually
really like TG lipsticks so that has me
excited and then the other two shades I
didn't swatch because I'm going to put
these in a giveaway this one is a red
and it is called red rose but there is
what that one looks like and then the
other one is called tres chic on almost
looks to be like a deeper Brown so I'm
not going to swatch those I will have
those out for a giveaway here are the
swatches of the three lipsticks that I
felt called out to me the most and for
the lip glosses they actually have a
gloss for each lipstick so the same
names so this is what the packaging of
the lip glosses look like and then this
is what the applicator looks like on
each one a pretty standard lip gloss
applicator so these are the swatches on
my hand they are pretty sheer so I don't
know how well you will be able to see
them but the first one over here is true
beauty second one right here is the
leaves and then the last one we have is
that save on fare so those are the lip
gloss swatches so there are the
lipsticks and then the corresponding lip
glosses swatched out on my hand since I
do have more of a pink look going on I
think what I'm actually going to do is
use this middle shade which is bellies
and then put the gloss over it because
it kind of is a little bit too pink for
my lip but I think if I put the gloss on
it I will like it better so I'm going to
go ahead and try out the leave on my
lips there are they two matching lip
glosses for red rose and at tres chic as
well these will also be an upcoming
giveaway
and see if they'll leave lipstick that's
actually a really nice lipstick I kind
of could tell right off the bat that I
like these more than the Pirates of the
Caribbean one like that was like if you
saw my top lip it was just like boy amp
and it's it's there it's pigmented it's
very creamy mmm all right I actually
really like that lipstick too so I'm
going to put a little of the bellieve
gloss on top of it as well just to see
what it looks like again the glosses
been is to watch it super pigmented but
we'll go ahead and see how it looks on
top there are my lips was the belly
lipstick and a lip gloss I mean
obviously the lipsticks are so super
creamy I really don't even feel like you
need to put a lip gloss on top of them
I'm not a huge lipgloss person but these
actually aren't sticky at all they feel
really nice on the lips
I don't think it did anything like
actual color wise I think it just made
them glossy versus creamy that looks
nice I think it complements the pink of
eyes that has going on as well my sauce
on the lipstick and lip glosses you do
have to buy them in the kits I believe
the lipsticks for the $36 for the five
and the glasses for $34 for the five for
me personally I'm more of a liquid
lipstick lover that's kind of what I
gravitate towards and more of what I
wear every single day so for me to
purchase a size lipstick bundle it
probably wouldn't make the most sense
for me I do like to lipstick so if you
like a creamy regular lipsticks I think
that you would really like this formula
I'm also not a really big a lipgloss
person and they did all swatch out
pretty sheer I kind of like my lip gloss
I have a little bit of mousse to it
it's for just a little bit like to sheer
for my liking but they feel nice on the
list if you do like lip gloss I don't
think this is a bad lip gloss it's just
going to depend on what your preferences
so well I like the lipstick and I think
it looks nice it's definitely not like
my favorite from the collection
definitely the cheek palette is and then
the eyeshadow palette and then it would
be the lipstick and then the lip gloss
but hopefully those swatches helps you
out and seeing them on my lips but once
we have the lips done then that's going
to do it for this first impression on
the lorac and beauty in the Beast
collection okay so that is going to
do it for my first impression demo
