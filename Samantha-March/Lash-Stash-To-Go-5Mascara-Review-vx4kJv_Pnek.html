video I'm finally finally finally doing
my review on the lash stash to-go box
that i got like forever ago but it came
with five mini mascaras and so i've been
using them all several times so i can
have reviews on each mascara and let you
guys know which one I picked as my lash
stash to go winner because I have this
little voucher that came in the box with
it and you get to pick your favorite one
out of them and redeem it for full-size
mascara so if you would like to see my
reviews on these five mascaras please
keep watching from blink and it says
stop painting your lashes tube them this
is what the packaging looks like for
that so a little silver bottle and here
is what the wand looks like this was
probably like the most basic wand out of
all five of the mascaras even when I was
going through the box and showing them i
think i mentioned like because a lot of
the other ones are like really long or
have crazy wand to it and this one was
pretty standard so the thing about the
blink one is that it is a tube mascara
so if you're not familiar with a tube
mascara basically what it is is when you
put it on your eyelashes it's attaching
like tubes to them to make your
eyelashes longer and it's really great
in theory I did like the mascara the
only thing that I don't like about two
mascaras and I've used them several
times in the past is that when you take
off your mascara you then get those
black tubes like all over your face I
remember using it for the first time you
know taking my mascara off not even
realizing it until the next morning but
I woke up and I looked in my sink and I
was like what it wasn't my sink like I
thought bugs were in there like I don't
know what went through my mind early
that morning but I was like what
happened here but it was just all the
tubes that had fallen out and I didn't
even realize it when I was going about
that night but then I had to like scrub
my sink the next morning because they
had like already it to us it was kind of
a
so for that reason I'm not a huge fan of
tube mascara especially because if
you're out if you even like rub your eye
a little bit or rub your eyelashes those
tubes can fall out so that's why I don't
particularly love to mascara one
honestly the tubes I didn't think for
anything crazy i don't think it made my
eyelashes extremely long i don't think
it made them particularly thick at any
point so i mean good mascara if you want
natural eyelashes if you just like our
on the run somewhere and don't want to
do anything too crazy this could be a
good option for you but what i really
look for a mascara it wasn't my
favorites the next one that was in there
is from josie maran and it's the black
oil mascara so that's what the packaging
looks like very fun you know bright
colors the blue and the orange and here
is what the wand looks like the
description on the box says this is a 5
sphere brush and it delivers length and
nourishing natural extracts so I really
like the packaging on this it's a wetter
mascara which I tend to gravitate
towards so I liked that but I ran into a
really big issue with this mascara and
it was that it really irritates my eyes
there are some products that I just find
that I cannot wear the Maybelline oh
shoot what is that mascara called the
one that everyone raves about the
telescopic is it no it's lore'l lore'l
telescopic mascara everyone loves it
it's a great mascara it does great thing
for eyelashes but it irritates my eyes
so bad they turn bloodshot they hurt
like I get gunk in them it's I can't use
it I don't know why I'm not sure what
ingredient is in there that does it I
also have some like gel glitter eye
liners from the knicks line can't use it
does the same thing I remember I was so
excited one night I had just bought the
knicks gel eyeliner it was my birthday
party put it on my top eyelashes you
kind of winged it out everyone was
complimenting me at the beginning of the
night about halfway through the night
and pictures you can tell my eyes are
bloodshot not because I had been
drinking a lot it was because it
irritated my eyes so bad I couldn't wait
to get home to take off the eyeliner and
unfortunately this is doing the same
thing to my eyes I've used it probably
three or four times and like after I
realized it the second time that it was
the mascara that was bothering me I was
like okay I just need to really make
sure because i don't want to say that
and have it be you know an eyeliner
pencil or an eyeshadow or something so
the last two times I tried it I used it
with Jess mascara I didn't put anything
also my eyes and it still irritated my
eyes so I'm actually going to go through
the like the L'Oreal telescopic mascara
and look at the ingredients and compared
to this mascara to see if I can figure
out what exactly is causing that because
it really seems when you don't realize
it and yeah you're out somewhere and
your eyes start to get irritated so bad
that it just hurts to keep them open so
well I liked it I thought it looked
really good on my eyelashes I don't know
why it bothers my eye so much but
unfortunately this one really didn't
work out for me and I bummed about it
but i would say for other people it did
make my lashes longer I didn't think it
really made them like thicker or have
more volume but it definitely did make
them longer and it is really really
black so if you like really black
mascara of a good one for you next one
that I want to talk about is from a lamb
comb and this is their Hypnose drama
mascara it's just in this black and gold
packaging I really like the packaging on
it this is what the Wanda looks like so
it has a pretty significant curve in it
and this mascara on the box it says it
creates fanned out high volume lashes I
did I didn't see like high volume lashes
I didn't think it made my lashes look
really dramatic it kind of reminded me
of the blank mascara but with just a
little bit more emphasis this is what I
find myself using like if I'm going out
but you know just running errands are
like going to dinner maybe meeting with
some friends like I'm not going on a
night out and I'm not having
a special occasion I still want mascara
on my lashes but I don't feel like the
need to have a lot of drama a lot of
volume a lot of length i would put this
on so this was my like day-to-day
mascara that i found it more than the
blank you know it doesn't have the tubes
and i thought it gave just a little bit
more than the blink so this is why this
one would be my like go to day-to-day
mascara so you know if you're looking
for a mascara like that that need your
lashes to be like the star of the show
but you just want some mascara on there
that's what I found this one was really
good so I have two left to talk about
and they're my two favorite and the
bunch really actually had a hard time
trying to decide between these two which
one was going through my fault sighs but
I will give you my runner up first and
that is the tart lights camera flashes
so this is pretty funky packaging like
the gold it's kind of like textured
which I really like and here is what the
wand looks like it's like a big kahuna
wand it's quite thick says it's dual
molded brush coat each lash for instant
and saturated volume yeah I agree with
that this one is definitely one that I
grabbed on night out where did I last
use it we had a rehearsal dinner for a
friend who was getting married I grabbed
this to wear that night at the rehearsal
it makes your lashes longer and make
some fuller it definitely gives them a
lot of drama I really like it I had a
really really hard time choosing if I
could have chosen to from the box to
pick it this one would have been in it
tooks i really liked it i might get the
full size of it anyways just because i
like it so much and i found myself so
once i first got the box and i was
trying out the different mascaras i
tried this like early on and then i
found myself that i kept reaching for it
and i was like no you have to try the
other mascara samantha like you can't
just keep putting this one on so i
really really liked it highly recommend
this one so that means that my personal
winner in the lash stash to-go box is
the better than sex mascara from Too
Faced
so there's what the packaging looks like
it's in this very cute light shade of
pink here is what the Wanda looks like
this is the most intense one out of all
of them it's big and thick and fluffy
and I absolutely love this mascara I was
recently in a wedding this is the
mascara that I used I reach for it so
often when we travel and I'm just
throwing a few things in my travel
makeup bag this has come with me every
single time I love it it makes your like
your lashes are just dramatic when you
put this on it makes them big it makes
them full and make some thick I just
truly loved it so this was my winner I
don't want to say hands down because I
loved the tart one as well but this one
I just I just love I need to have the
full size in my collection like I just I
just have to have it sister I've said as
that it separates coats and curls to a
voluptuous perfection I agree love it if
you don't have the better than sex
mascara yet from to face i highly
recommend you get it I thought it was
awesome so that is the one that I'll be
using to redeem my full size product
this it does say that you have to redeem
it at a Sephora so you can't do it
online it also says you cannot redeem it
out of sephora inside the jcpenney
stores we have to sephora 'he's close by
to my house one is a standalone in a
mall but it's like the regular giant
Sephora store the other one we have is
in a mall but it is inside the JCPenney
store so i'll have to make sure when i
go to redeem it that i go to the big
regular sephora be excited so this
entire lash stash to-go box I got it on
sephora and it was $25 and you've got
the five mini mascaras for each so you
get a trim all out see which one you
love and then it also comes with the
mascara voucher so you can choose one to
get a full-size and I think like all of
these mascaras whichever one you choose
they were all in like the 22-25 dollar
range so basically you're getting your
money back when you read
it for your full-size mascara so I think
this is a brilliant idea I absolutely
loved being able to try out all these
mascaras I found some new ones that I
really enjoy so I think this is just a
great deal it's also a really good gift
idea if you have any like birthdays or
anything like that coming up for your
friends this is a pretty cool idea it's
like its own little gift set and then
they get another free product on top of
that so it's like yeah why not so you
have twenty-five dollars on sephora i
think they have it in the stores too i'm
pretty sure i've seen at the stores but
i will leave a link to the lash stash to
go box below and I will also link each
individual mascara as well for you guys

ideas tried any of these mascaras out
