am going to be doing the lifetime
milestone tag video I'm really excited
to do this one I just did the booktuber
newbie tag but I wasn't actually tagged
by anyone I just saw that a lot of new
books ubers we're doing this tag video
so I decided like hey I nominate myself
to do it sooo but I was actually tagged
to do this one by Sammy talks I will
leave her video that she did down below
I believe she actually just started a
new channel and I think it's called the
bookish spirit but I will also leave a
link i'll leave the link to her video
that she did for this tag and then i'll
leave a link to her channel if you guys
want to check her out and subscribe
thank you for tagging me i will be
tagging some of you as well and that
will all be in the description box below
and this video is kind of you have to
pick a book for each like milestone in
your life so we go from birth all the
way to death and then a few in between
and you have to pick books that
correlate with that I was tied to a
while ago to do this video but it took
me so long to come up with my final list
and what books I wanted to feature in
what books fell into which areas that
were doing for this tag video but I
finally have my list and I'm ready to
film and I really hope you enjoy this
video so the first question in the tag
video is birth and it is the first book
that an author wrote and I chose
Something Borrowed by emily giffin and i
chose this because i absolutely love
this book and this book was kind of
something that inspired me to start
chiclet plus i read it i borrowed it
from a roommate that i was living with
other time i read the book and it just
like moved something at me and it just
made me excited all over again to kind
of follow my passion and I mentioned in
one of my very first videos that I knew
I always wanted to be a writer and do
something with books but I didn't think
was very practical so I went to a
business college and got my bachelor's
degree and it was so there
last year that I read this book and I
thought okay I need to do something more
and I think it was like three days after
reading this book i started chiclet plus
and everything just went from there and
the next one on the list we moved to
child this one was we had to pick a book
that was fun to read very enjoyable and
I tried to think of like my childhood
and what I was enjoying reading been and
of course I had to go with something
from the baby-sitters club and I chose
Christie's a great idea by ian m martin
this was like all I read when I was a
young girl i know i mentioned in a
previous video that i actually started
reading the books out a little bit too
young of an age and i found out things
like the Tooth Fairy wasn't real and
things like that from reading the
babysitter Club books with my mom wasn't
very impressed by but these are just
when I think of my childhood and I think
about what I was reading it was the
baby-sitters club I owned so many of the
books I who who was like around my age
didn't love the baby-sitters club
because I feel like you're lying if you
say you didn't I'll feel like you're
lying and then we move on to school and
we were to pick a book that takes place
in a school and the one that I chose for
this is one breath away and it's by
Heather good and cough and this one is
set in a school as a pretty serious book
though it's actually about a gunman in a
school it was really hard to put down
but yeah kind of main focus is this
gunman in the school and the events that
happened from there then we move on to
our teenage years and we are to pick a
book that has a main character that is
troubled or has a lot of angst and this
book kind of popped in my mind right
away this is pulled within and this is
by marni man and this is actually a
second book in a series there's also
pulled beneath which kicks off the bar
harbor series but the books canon be
right as a standalone to meet the main
character ray in the first book but just
very briefly and the second book is
alray story and she has a lot going on
this book was
on the pretty dark side and Ray in the
first book we kind of get the feeling
that we're not going to really like Ray
and things like that and then we
actually get more into her story and
this book but I mean I would definitely
say she has a lot of angst she has a lot
of anger she just has a lot of issues
going on in this book but it was so hard
to put down and up but I I just I really
enjoyed this book I enjoyed both books
in the birth in the bar harbor series
but yes if you're looking for a book
with a lot of angst from your main
character feel like this one would work
and then we move on to our adult years
and were to choose a book that has like
an adult theme or a lot of hardships and
I chose things you won't say bye Sarah
peeking in I'm probably not saying that
right a dodge so I go for and like say
whatever first came to my mind that
doesn't sound right at all though but
i'm actually listening to this one right
now and in the audio book version of it
and i am completely enjoying it but
there is a lot of adult themes here a
lot of hardships the book actually
follows hop who is involved in a racial
issue a cop who a white cop who shot a
hispanic boy and there's a lot going on
them in the book i would say it is a
very adult book but i keep walking my
dog like even a longer and i keep
stretching out our walks because I'm
like wait I don't want to stop listening
I don't want to go back in my office and
go back to work and stop listening to
this book because it is a really good
then keeping on the adult thing we were
next going to choose a book that
features a career that we love and I
chose Lake Como and this is why i needa
hughes need is one of my favorite
authors I when I saw like choosing a
career I was like it has to be someone
from anita's because I just I just love
her books and they inspire me so much
but in this bug the career is actually
an interior designer and don't laugh but
I'm like on a huge interior design kick
right now I thing I wish I could do
honestly its interior design I don't
feel like I'm very good
it but I wish I could and right now I'm
like totally into YouTube videos
watching design tips and like decorating
tips and all that so I thought this book
would be really funny it said I could
share that with you guys there's also a
lot of travel in the book as well and I
love travelling so if I could like make
a career out of traveling I would do
that too and then we move on to marriage
and we were to choose a book with a
powerful romance and I actually chose
the life list by Christine Anderson this
book is it's the first in a trilogy and
it's kind of funny because I mostly
involves an affair so I thought that was
maybe not the best book for a marriage
book but there is a powerful romance in
this story of you guys and this was a
book but I couldn't put down it was a
book that made me look so unhappy so
much while reading it but still I
couldn't stop reading it I still gave it
a five star review I mean if you I'm
gonna try really hard to find my reviews
so i can link it for you guys but this
book just it was really really
incredible to read and I loved the
entire trilogy so i highly recommend
this one on two children and we're
supposed to pick a book that has
children as a main character and this
one I was a little stumped by for a few
minutes because I don't really read
children's books or like I read a little
bit of young adult but those aren't
children so I was like what in the world
would I pick and then I remembered the
baby-sitters club I was also a fan of
babysitters little sister so I chose
Karen's carnival and this is by Ana
Martinez well and I chose this one
because i remember reading it as a
little girl I mean I have no idea how
old I was when I read this book but you
know Karen and her friends put on a
carnival and my list up and I was like I
can put on a carnival too and I spent an
entire day drying up like what booths I
wanted at my carnival and what friends I
wanted to like be out which booth and it
just both the baby-sitters club and the
baby-sitters club little sisters they
just gave me so many fun ideas to do as
a little kid and so I had to include
that in here as well and then we move on
to our midlife crisis and we were to
choose a book that has a crazy
your unexpected plot twist me is
breaking the rule by cat lavoie and I
was like can I put this one in here
because this is a book from my own
publishing company but I was like hey
this has a crazy unexpected plot twist
so I need to mention it breaking the
rules this is cats first book and she
actually hired me first as her editor
and I was reading the long reading along
its Chiclets if you can't tell from the
cover really enjoyed it and then office
on the plot was happens and it was like
that's what it was like I'm not gonna
say anything more because I wouldn't
want to ruin it for you at all because I
would want you to make that same
expression when you read this book and
now we move on to grandchildren and were
to pick a book that has like a strong
family element to it and you guys if
you've watched my other videos you know
how much I love the seeds of a daisy by
Alison Caleb and this follows really
closely a mother-daughter relationship
and they have such a strong bonds that I
just knew I had to include it for family
coming from someone who doesn't have a
father I I related to this book a lot
because of the mother-daughter
relationship and the relationship that I
have with my own mother and he loved
this book I thought I had the print copy
somewhere but I'd like torn my office
apart and I can't find it I don't know
if I'm going crazy or what maybe I sent
it to my mom actually mom did i send
that book to you i can't remember but
that one was the one that i absolutely
loved i gave it five stars as well as
book two fellows it which is the silver
cord and then the very last one we come
to death but it's really not too sad but
we had to pick a book like in a series
or trilogy or duology that was the very
last book and we didn't want to see the
series come to an end and I immediately
thought of the girlfriend series by
savannah paige and this is when
girlfriends find love i believe there
was seven books in this series and we
follow a group of girlfriends to the
whole series we just get another like
the main point of view from each
different friend along the way and one
of my favorite series I
I'm planning to do like a top five
chicklet series coming up here soon and
this was the very first series that i
put on there absolutely love it I was
really bummed to see it come to an end
even though it might sound weird
considering there was seven books to
read but I enjoyed all of them savannah
paige is such a good writer and these
were such good chick lit books but also
focused a lot on friendship are all the
books in the lifetime milestone tag I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank

this and I will be taking some of you

box I hope to have a few more tag videos
