today's video is going to be a new oh
will i buy it for my will I bite
Wednesday series so if you are new here
thank you so much for coming by my
channel my name is Samantha and I post
videos about every single day because I
love what I do but I do have the will i
buy it series where every wednesday
typically in the mornings i will upload
a new will i buy a video and basically
I'm just taking usually new releases its
mostly what I'm featuring in these
videos I either take a couple of
products or i'll do a collection like
I'm doing today and I'll just kind of
discuss the products share photos the
prices where is available when it's
available but I also discuss if I'm
going to purchase it myself or if I am
going to pass on it I got the idea a
while back to do a will i buy it video
because i still wanted to be able to
talk about new makeup releases on my
channel but i cannot afford to go out
and buy everything and I don't get P our
packages very often so that's why I kind
of came up with this idea just to kind
of chat with you guys like you guys are
my friends like this is how I would talk
to my friends if I was trying to think
about whether to buy something or not
and like my husband really doesn't care
to hear about my makeup purchases he's
not someone that I'm really going to
talk to so I'm going to talk to you guys
instead and it's really nice because a
lot of times I can get your feedback
sometimes the products have already come
out some people watching have already
purchased it and they can give their
opinions or you know we can just kind of
talk to each other as friends and hang
out for a little bit so that's what I
really like to make these videos it's
also sometimes when I make these videos
I don't quite know yet i'm going to
purchase something or not and i kind of
like talked my way through it as I'm
making the video so that's kind of fun
as well but yes everyone's day I have
the will i buy it Wednesday videos so if
you are new here I hope that you will
click the subscribe button down below so
you get notified when I have future
videos even though you can probably just
come to my channel every single day and
you'll probably find something new that
I'm talking about but today's video is
going to be all about the mariah carey n
mac collection so i'm going to go over
as much as the collection as i can and
just give my thoughts about it and if
i'm going to purchase anything from the
collection or not so if you would like
to see my thoughts on the mariah carey
and mac collection please keep watching
ok so i feel like this video might be a
little bit hard for me to film so when I
was doing the will i buy it videos just
kind of like sporadically I was
typically
taking like a handful products usually
like four to five products and talking
about them but since I do them every
week I figure there can be some videos
from I'm focusing like exclusively on a
collection like the last bill i buy a
video i did was all about the peach
collection from Too Faced and I've been
seeing a lot of people asking about
proprietary collection and then I
mentioned it in last week's video would
you guys want to see it and a lot of
yeses came in from that so I wanted to
record it but it's just I feel like it's
going to be hard for me sometimes with
these collections they can be a little
challenging especially it seems like
these collections from Mac because it's
not like the two-faced collection where
they just had like the four or five
items or whatever that they're putting
out like this is a full full collection
so let's see everything in the
collection I believe this is everything
Five lipstick shades five lip glosses to
lip liners a liquid liner to lash
options a powder brush to blushes a
loose powder and I brush to our shadow
palettes and a bronzer if I go through
each item individually and like spend
any like certain amount of time on each
item this is going to be like an hour
long video that is HUGE that's a very
very large collection so I'm like okay
how can I do this in the best way
possible but i think i'll try to focus
on each set of options just talk about
them what I think about it and just give
a little bit of a like yes or no so we
can try to get there as quickly as I can
another reason why I feel like this
video might be kind of hard to film is
because i'm actually not a big mac
cosmetics type of girl i know there are
people out there who just love mac and
they have so much from mac i have mac
fix plus i have mac lip liner in whirl
and that might be everything that I own
from back oh I have a pigment and I have
a mac pignon in vanilla carli bybel
maybe but it's in that video so that's
all that I have from Mac and I'm okay
with that I've just never really gotten
like super into the brand like some
people do and I can't really tell you
why it is but I mean it's the same with
everything some people have the makeup
brands that they're like ride or die for
and then makeup brands that are just
kind of like me to us you know what I
mean I mean it's the same way was
fashion it's the same way with food I
mean like we just all have our
preferences and I have just
never really gravitated towards Mac so
when I saw this collection come out my
first thought was honestly like oh you
know no no need anything like I don't
want to go into Mac I don't really want
to order online from back I've actually
the very few times that I've ordered
from Mac I've had issues with them with
their customer service and things like
that and it's just those little tiny
things can just turn you off so much so
i know i saw the collection come on that
was like no i don't really need anything
but i was like no you know watch the
videos you know some of the influencers
getting PR packages and like just watch
them see what the collection looks like
see what it's all about and then where I
carry came out with like her I think
it's like an eight parts documentary
series on e and so I started watching
that too because I was like oh I'm
interested in it right Kari is someone
who like I loved as a young girl like I
thought she was just so amazed balls
when I was younger and growing up I just
thought she was amazing and I mean
obviously she's incredibly talented like
her voice is like none other I mean her
voice is just insane so it's actually
been kind of fun she's I don't know if I
want to say like she's a private person
but kind of when it comes to celebrity
she's more of a private person she's not
always just boom out there like some
other people are I've been really trying
to watch as many videos as I can and
look at the spa tchas and see what see
what others feedback is before I you
know just completely right off the
collection because i don't like mac and
because you know even though i like
mariah carey she's not someone that like
i love and like a super bass was and you
know what to be honest i don't i don't
think Mariah Carey is super going to
benefit from me buying her lipstick like
I think she's fine financially I'm just
gonna go inside like I think she's side
like sometimes when the other youtubers
put out collapse like you want to
support them you want them to have your
money like I don't feel like Mariah
really is gonna care if I give her you
know twenty dollars or whatever so I've
been trying to pay close attention to
everything so I can you know kind of be
honest and fair and just as put as much
research as I can into these videos so
that's what I've been doing that's what
i've been doing like the past like four
days it's been all but I carry my Gary
right Gary right I'll just go ahead and
start i have like some little list here
on my phone that i'm going to go over
each thing so let's just go ahead and
Joe
in to the first set so jumping into it
there are lipsticks and there are five
of them I get so ooc which is a
shimmering ground frost all I want which
is his champagne shimmer frost bit of
bubbly is a soft pinky nude and a
cremesheen dulling is in pink Eph which
is a cremesheen and Mick izle is the
pool peach in cremesheen so these are
twenty dollars us / lipstick ok so the
collection on a whole is just completely
Mariah Carey sparkly and glittery and
shiny and so cool i mean the packaging
is super freaking cool lipsticks I mean
the packaging it just it looks so cool
um you know a lot of the shades as I'm
reading through a shimmery brown
champagne shimmer soft pinky nude pinky
peach cool peach I mean you're not
gaining any like bold shades to be able
to choose from which makes sense because
that's not really what you see Mariah
Carey and I mean this is her collection
and it definitely speaks to her now the
thing with the MAC lipsticks is that I
don't actually like mac lipsticks which
I know is like so crazy and whenever I
say that I feel like the majority of
people look at me like you don't because
mac lipsticks I feel like so many people
really love them and you you always hear
people talking about their mac lipsticks
and I have tried some I've never bought
him myself I've tried him as like
samples in the store and I've had
friends that have had mac lipsticks and
I've tried him and I just find them to
be like super dry and crumbly on my lips
I just do I don't gravitate toward mac
lipsticks I've never purchased on myself
i purchased a lip liner and i thought it
was just fine but it's so crazy to me
because I once tried a friend had velvet
teddy and I tried it and I was like yeah
I like the color but I don't like the
way it feels on my lips like it feels
icky this was before I even was on
YouTube by the way this was a long time
ago and I was like oh just know I don't
like it and then I started watching
YouTube videos and I watched Catherine
lights and she had a good Dukes video
and she said one wild bear it all is a
dupe for max velvet teddy and I went out
and bought the wet and wild one because
I was like I remember I still really
like that color I just didn't like how
it felt on my lips when wild is the what
299 for
lipstick and I love it I wear it all the
time I think it's an amazing lipstick
I'm constantly recommending it I love
bear doll from wet wild so I mean there
you go like a lot of things with Mac I
just feel like are really expensive and
I don't love them and I find other
brands that you know maybe some are less
expensive maybe some of the same price
point but I just like how they feel and
how they wear on me so much better so
I'm not going to purchase any of the
lipsticks because I just personally
don't like any of Maca lipsticks and
almost like the frost just frosted
lipstick on me does not look good so
that cancels out two of them right away
and then three were like the cremesheen
ones if I had to pick one I'd probably
pick Mick izle it just looked like the
best one to me it's a cool peach or
Dowling which was a pinky peach but I'm
not going to get any of these lipsticks
or twenty dollars apiece and I just I
mean I can stick with my when wild and
my color pop I've Claire top of my lips
right now so I'm not gonna get into the
lipsticks but of course let us know are
you going to get any lipsticks have you
so the next one to talk about is some
lip glosses or lip glass I guess is what
these are called i remember when i was
watching videos and i think it was kc
homes this video where she was like in
this lip glass and this lip glass I'm
like what is she saying has she drinking
why is she saying lipglass but that's it
is that is what it does look glass there
are eighteen fifty apiece for us there's
five of them is just like honey is at
and shimmer rainbow interlude as a soft
white shimmer little miss Monroe is a
true gold shimmer dream lover is a dirty
pink shimmer and butterfly bullying as a
pink bronze shimmer that is an online
exclusive by the way so lip gloss so I'm
not a big lip gloss type of girl i have
a few and every once in a while I get
like a crazy hair and i decided i'm
going to buy a lip glass like when i
decided to buy a 28 LOL applause from
marc jacobs I don't know what came over
me sephora was having a sale so i did it
but i'm just not huge into lip gloss
this packaging they look so cool like of
it the lip gloss is to me just like
totally stuck out i just think think
they look so cool and like so much fun
but again i just don't personally where
the lip glosses often enough that I
I would be able to say yes and I also
just bought a $28 lip gloss guys like I
feel like I don't need to purchase all
applause for a while because I'm going
to make the most out of that lip gloss
if you watched my cyber things my cyber
monday haul I talked about buying the
Marc Jacobs sugar sugar lip gloss it's a
recommendation from Jaclyn hill and I've
been wearing it a lot I've been really
happy with it but I feel like I'm just
gonna wear that until it's completely
gone and I feel justified in making that
$28 purchase because that was a tough
pill to swallow but I swallowed it but
no I'm just not big enough into lip
glosses and you know for all the other
reasons that I stated at the beginning
it just it wasn't something that I was
like oh my gosh I feel like I have to
have it 1850 you know it's more
expensive for a lip gloss but nothing
too crazy compared to some other ones
and I don't know the the swatches looked
fine to me nothing really like made me
super excited and it just I don't feel
like the colors would look great on me
from the glasses that I've seen um the
butterfly bling was like the pink brown
shimmer like maybe that one I don't
maybe I feel like I'm having to stretch
it to like try to pick my favorite one
out of that but again just just not
enough to like get me really super
excited you know how about you guys
though do you need a lip glass in your
collection so there are two Pro Longwear
lip pencils there $22 each they're so
dramatic and deep brown and then new
ombre and cool peach help again I mean
if you're not new to my channel I barely
wear lip liner like I have a handful of
lip liners but a lot of times there's
ones that were like sent to me or they
were like included in the set I don't
know if I can remember the last time I
just went out and purchased a lip liner
on its own I just don't wear them enough
there are some liquid lipsticks that I
feel like you do need to wear a lip
liner with Anasazi Beverly Hills like
what lipstick is one of them I think
that you just like hands down need a lip
liner with that but a lot of the ones
that I wear color pop who to beauty kat
von d I don't think that you need lip
liner so I just don't wear them enough
and what did I say is a price was these
are 22 dollars each like I'd rather just
buy another lipstick than buying a lip
liner I just don't wear them enough to
be able to justify it but i don't know
maybe you're a big lip liner person
maybe you feel like you knew this in
your collection if i were to get either
of them i'd probably get cool peach
because that's
mostly I wear a lot of like nudes and
pinks and things like that so deep brown
probably wouldn't work out for me but I
just don't wear lip liners enough to be
able to purchase one for $22 ok so there
are also two I shadow palettes that she
came out with one is I'm that chick you
like it has four different eyeshadow
shades in it whenever you call which is
a yellow gold can't escape me which is a
dirty mocha with a gold pearl golden
petals scattering okay which is a cool
brown shimmer and how you throw me rich
dark brown are those like names of her
songs I don't I don't know what I don't
know what those guys that name is our
golden petal scattering so the eyeshadow
palette for the four shades inside is
$41 the second eyeshadow palette same
thing for eyeshadows $41 you have
diamond butterfly which is a silver
white shimmer I'd give my all muted
mid-tone gray images of rapture need a
black with red shimmer and twinks deep
plum with pearl in kc homes this video
she had one of the eyeshadow palettes I
can't think of which one she had in a
tutorial with it and it looked nice and
I had seen some swatches before that and
some videos for that and then when Casey
did her tutorial I was like wait
actually kind of do like that looked
like you got that look from that palette
I actually like that but again if you're
not new to my channel you know that I'm
not an eyeshadow palette junkie and I
say that and I recently purchased a lot
of our shout about it so I don't need
any more eyeshadow palette especially
right now to make too many purchases
recently of eyeshadows that I don't need
this one in my collection so I'm going
to pass over the eyeshadow palettes but
are you guys going to get a shot of
house have you if you're only choosing
one which one are you like gravitating
towards I don't know they seem
interesting $41 foreshadows I mean the
packaging is cool and all that so let us
know your thoughts as well all right
there's also two powder blushes there
twenty-four dollars each you've got me
feeling as a light candy pink and sweet
sweet fantasy is a deep coral I think
Casey had the sweet sweet fantasy and
she said it was like a hot hot pink and
that's not at all what I wear for a
blush so the light candy pink you've got
me feeling I feel like I haven't seen as
many people talk about that one that one
would probably be more my style but I've
never tried a mac
that's one thing from Mac that I've just
hands-down like never tried never
samples never swatched never I've never
played with mac blushes at all I don't
have any friends with my blushes like
I've just never tried mac blushes I hear
feel I could things about them though
which is interesting what did I say they
were twenty four dollars each I mean 24
yeah that's pretty pricey for a blush
again I don't feel like I gravitate
towards blushes a lot and I do have
quite a few blushes I feel like this
video is like gonna be so boring because
I ever think i'm setting I'm like I
don't need that I don't need that I
don't need that but we're also what two
weeks away from Christmas and I mean I'm
feeling it you guys like I've had a lot
of gifts for people to buy for and to
think about and traveling and all that
good stuff and forgettin bind wrapping
paper and tape and I have a big giveaway
coming up that i just bought everything
for and that was really pricey so I know
that I need to like rein it in i
probably need to put myself on a know by
here probably right now so i'm sorry if
this video is like boring but i just
want to talk you guys through it like a
real person who has to make the
decisions of what makeup they're gonna
buy you know like super important
decisions in our lives you guys like but
i'm just i just want to chat with you as
a friend and you know do i need another
blush especially at twenty four dollars
no i don't i just i simply don't so I'm
not gonna purchase the blushes either so
shocker but are you going to let us know
my okay so let's keep it rollin so we
have a loose powder and touch my body
which is a radiant gold shimmer and it's
3950 this honestly is probably the one
that I feel like is the most interesting
of the collection and it comes in like a
cool canister and its got like a cool
brush fluffy thing with it and you just
kind of put it all over and it gives you
like a shimmer and you know Sparkle and
Mariah Carey shimmer type of thing I
thought this one looked super cool but I
know that I would not purchase this like
when I saw that was like there's no way
I could ever wear something like that
because my husband hates glitter he
hates glitter he's like shimmer bothers
him I have wore like glitter on my eyes
the other day and he was like it's not
gonna get on me he's like a phobia of
glitter it's very strange but I've
learned about I knew this about him when
I met
him and I we weren't even dating yet
glitter shimmer anything like that on my
body there's no way so I would I hands
down know that I could never make this
purchase because I would never be able
to wear it unless I was like trying to
repel my husband and that would be
really weird if that was happening we
are just about through the entire
collection so the next one that I want
to talk about is the extra dimension
skin finish this is 45 50 and comes in
my Mimi which is a warm gold shimmer
does one that I really didn't have a lot
of interest in I thought Casey did a
really good job of kind of like
explaining i can leave her video link
down below since i'm mentioning it quite
a bit but it just didn't really do
anything for me where like when she was
putting it on her i was like i'm not
seeing what is for that price tag
because that is pretty expensive for a
skin finish so 45 50 and i just any of
the swatches that i've seen so far on
the feedback that I've seen so far it
just does not love to be worth the price
at all so I'm definitely skipping over
that one so the next one is a liquid
eyeliner this is in this is my night
which is a rich brown black and it's $22
I really like eyeliners you guys and I
know that might sound super weird
because I'm like I don't love I shoulda
pellets now don't love blush and I'm
like eyeliner I like eyeliner I just
really do and is that one thing like
when people are like if you can leave
your house and be only wearing like one
piece of makeup what would it be to me
is eyeliner because without it I just
looked tired and I look young and I look
strange not awake so I just typically
will always always always have I light
around like people have actually asked
me like why don't you just had two
eyeliner on you because that freaks the
crap out of me no I don't want that done
the other is this kind of pricey it
looks nice once again the packaging
looks nice all of this is limited
edition I haven't even touched on that
because I feel like it would just be
repetitive to say but all of this is
limited edition and there it's filling
out very quickly and you know all that
jazz so I tried to be pretty cognizant
of what I'm purchasing that is limited
edition because it's harder to use in
makeup tutorials and to talk about
because you know it just means that
people aren't it's not you know
accessible to everybody all the time so
it can get harder to use limited edition
products so do i need to spend 22
dollars on an aisle
nerd that's going to be a limited
edition that what I want to use it in
tutorial six months from now i have to
say oh I'm using the mariah carey mac
eyeliner but you can get it because it
sold out and it's not coming back so
take that like I would just rather use
my regular eyeliner that you can buy any
time so I'm gonna skip over the eyeliner
what's new ok so there are two brushes
as well there's a 183 buffer brush which
is 59fifty and there is also the 239 I
shader brush which is 2850 so I'm
definitely skipping over the 60-day log
buffer brush because I don't I don't
need one I don't really even know what a
buffer brochures to be on it's just like
off the top of my head I'm like which
one what's the buffer brush again like
no that's fine sixty dollars on a buffer
brush and the I shader brush for 2850 us
I mean again it's just to me I'm like
why that this whole collection is I feel
like going to be good for someone who's
like a Mariah Carey like passionate fan
like you want this in your collection
you want it to be collectors items but I
don't need to spend 2850 on an eye
shader brush when I could spend ten
dollars and get the same one from morphe
like it just is I'm just not going to do
it so the buffer brush is just way too
expensive I wouldn't even consider that
really that's just way too pricey for me
to be spending on a makeup brush the
icater brush I mean definitely it's
still expensive but to me as i jus just
don't need it to me to me but it might
be different for you this is just me
though but I'm gonna pass over that it's
just not necessary for my collection at
this time well the last thing that we
have to talk about our eyelashes and
there are two different styles 05 and 36
I'm hopefully I'm putting pictures in
here along the way like I normally do my
will i buy it so you can see everything
these are eighteen dollars u.s. apiece
so I actually I kind of got excited
about the lashes because I like lashes
i'm wearing lashes right now i wear
lashes almost every single day I've
always before i got on youtube before I
even knew how to put lashes on I was
wearing lashes because I just love them
and I love the way that they make your
eyes look I just really appreciate them
so out of everything in this collection
I was like maybe I could actually
purchase the lashes because you can
really only get so many uses out of
lashes before you have to throw them
away so even though
limited edition it's like well yeah I
can use them in like really quickly in
upcoming tutorials or photos or maybe
they'll still be available or maybe
people still can get them but you know
six months down the road from now I'm
probably not still going to have these
lashes because I mean I can maybe get
like 10 15 20 it's probably the max max
amount that i can get out of flashes and
that is making sure like when i take
them off i am taking that adhesive off
very well or else you know you just get
to a point where you have to throw your
lashes away so these were the one thing
that i was really like I could actually
maybe get this if I wanted to like feel
part of the cool crowd youtube crowd and
purchase something from the mariah carey
Matt collection was it going to be it
would be the eyelashes they are eighteen
dollars apiece which you know this
expensive huda beauty is twenty dollars
so that's expensive I just bought some
new lashes from i lure from their luck
sign those were like eleven dollars so
that's pricey our del r del is always
solid to me and those are like four
dollars so you know so I mean they're
not the most expensive lashes that I've
ever seen they're not the cheapest
whatever they're more on the high end
range but I don't like the looks of them
and I'm so bummed both of them both ones
I mean there is one side I don't know
for sure which number it is that they
look a little bit like more wispy and i
really like wispy lashes and so I looked
at him and I looked at him oh but I just
I don't I don't like the way that they
look so I'm super bummed but I'm not
someone who's like crazy particular
about her eyelashes but if you were to
look at my eyelash collection a lot of
them are more like wispy fuller lashes
that's just kind of the type that I go
for and I just I don't feel like the two
that are in this collection would be for
me and I also just kind of look a little
I don't know they look I don't know how
to describe it but to me they just look
a little on like the gimmicky side which
makes me really sad because like I said
out of everything in the collection
these would really been things that I
were to purchase so I was paying close
attention to them and what they looked
like and if I thought that they would be
good for me but I don't think they would
be lashes that I love so you know maybe
if they were a little bit cheaper I'd
purchase it and just be like oh what the
heck like whatever their lashes I'll
wear them a couple times and that'll be
good but
I don't think they're gonna work out for
me so that wouldn't actually really did
bum me out because I was so excited when
I was planning this video I was like I'm
not gonna buy anything in are those
super boring videos but I was like no
the lashes like look again at the lashes
look at the third time look a fourth
time look at them on people what do you
think but I just can't do it so I won't
be purchasing the lashes either such a
bummer but like I was saying with this
collection it is everything is limited
edition and does appear to be in limited
qualities i already mentioned why i
don't try to purchase limited edition
it's just much harder being on youtube
and doing tutorials but the launch date
for these what i'm seeing its kind of
been like changed around a little bit
it's been a little bit on the confusing
side but so from what I'm seeing right
now and has already gone live on the mac
cosmetics website like i said there are
some pieces that are sold out but there
are still pieces available at the time
that i am filling this video also going
to be available at macy's and nordstrom
on December twelfth it looks like and
December 13th at bloomingdale's bulk and
dillards and then in stores on December
15th i think that's in stores and all of
the locations including the mac
locations so i believe it's december
15th that those will be coming out which
will be the day after this video goes
live so that timing actually worked out
pretty well so i will leave all the
information now but looks like i said i
think the dates have been changed around
so at the time i fill up my description
box typically just hours before i put a
video live so hopefully i can get the
most up-to-date information in the
description box down below please make
sure to check that because when I'm
filming sometimes all the information
hasn't been released or I don't have
certain pieces of information but I'm
still getting the video up so I will
leave anything in the description box
below I know sometimes I get comments
like you didn't say a prize or you
didn't say where it's available and then
so I check the description box because
everything will be done in their self
make sure you look at that but I will
leave all of the updated information
that i can find in the description box
down below including links as well in
case you would want to purchase anything
but that is going to be it for my next
will i buy a video featuring theme
mariah carey and mac cosmetics
collection hopefully this video wasn't
too like boring or like debbie downer
ish since i'm not purchasing anything
from the collection but hopefully you
guys could understand my reasonings and
why
decided to pass on the collection and
again like I said not in every will i
buy a video am I going to purchase
something and I mean honestly like more
times than that i'm not going to
purchase something because not
everything speaks to me that every brand
speaks to me sometimes i have and that's
in my collection I don't need to keep
purchasing and purchasing just for the
sake of buying it you know that sort of
thing i'm just so i'm just a real person
like is i have a youtube channel but i'm
just a real person over here and but i
just don't need everything in and I feel
like sometimes it can be harder with
watching these YouTube videos and seeing
especially like the bigger influencers
that get these PR packages and it's
always you need this you need this you
need this you need this like really
truly we don't so I mean if that's why I
make these videos to show that there can
be real people out there as well and
then and of course just to talk my way
through products and collections that
releases and to be able to talk to you
guys about new releases and stuff but
please do leave in the comments down
below what you think of the mariah carey
in my collection will you be getting any
of it have you purchased any of it will
you go to the stores on december 15th i
remember hearing that like the silvina
release when it came in stores which is
like pure craziness so where any of you
guys can actually get to a store and try
to purchase anything from the collection
I would love to know but also please do
leave in the comments below what you
would like to see in next week's will i

videos every Wednesday morning so you
