today's video is going to be a first
impression on the winky looks a flower
bomb so I've got a package in the mail
from Winkie lux few days ago I did a
haul video with it but I was also on my
snapchat showing everything that I got
and I mentioned this flower bomb and a
lot of people have questions about it I
had questions about it because it's just
a different type of product at least for
me it is I've never tried anything like
it and I'm super curious to try it out
so looking on the Winky Lux page I did
the description of us you can kind of
understand why I think it's so
interesting and why we're doing this
video together but it says we've added a
new magic pill to our collection this
balm stain applies unclear then reacts
with your skin's pH levels uniquely
creating the perfect shade of pink lips
just for you each flower balm contains a
real fairy picked Kristin Thiam not sure
if I'm saying that right in the color of
your choice not to mention it's coconut
scent it giving an aroma so enticing
that you'll want to wear every day so
I'm like okay so this is very
interesting so when you open it up this
is what looks like so it's like a clear
jelly and it does have the flower in
there and I was like okay cuz they sent
along some other lipsticks and I opened
them and then I opened this and I'm like
what is this so reading that on the
website I got very curious I also
noticed on the website that it says that
this ships out on November 29th but it
has an alert on there it says alert due
to overwhelming demand the next shipment
of flour bombs ship November 29th we
expect to sell out before the ship date
so don't wait to order so apparently
people are really digging on this so I'm
like okay why don't we give it a try so
I'm going to go ahead and apply to my
lips right away so we can see what it
looks like how long it takes that sort
of thing and then I will chat some more
but for now I have absolutely nothing on
my lips my lips are completely dry so
I'll go ahead zoom you in and apply this
you
I have it applied you can see it went on
clear I don't feel anything doesn't make
my lips feel weird or anything like that
I can't smell it because if you can't
tell from my voice I am sick right now
I'm battling a crazy cold and a really
bad cough so I keep losing my voice oh
that's not my voice I'm so weird but it
says it has a a coconut scent but I
can't I can't smell anything at this
moment so I can't tell you if that claim
is true or not I apologise but oh okay
so it's already turning pink alright so
we'll wait a little bit more so I just
applied it I just thought this was
really interesting and again when I did
the haul on snapchat a lot of people are
asking me questions about it and asked
if I would show them you know applying
the lipstick and what it does so that's
why I thought maybe it could be
something fun to do a first impression
for so again on the Winky Lux website
these sell for $12 and again the next
shipment will ship out November 29th
I'll leave a link down below but it says
they expect to sell out before then so
if you want to get it I'd say go ahead
and get it and it looks like they have
three different colors so like one the
flower inside is pink one is yellow and
one is green it doesn't say if that
means anything or not I'm curious like
as you keep using it like what happens
when you get really down there with the
flower I'm curious to find that out
myself okay so I just keep looking in
the viewfinder my lips are definitely
getting Pinker I've also done a little
bit of research on these and it's
supposed to be like even after the balm
kind of fades away your your lips are
supposed to be left with a stain because
it did say this was like a lip stain so
even after the bone is gone and you
don't look like you have like anything
glossy on your lips you should still
have like the pink stains lips so that's
kind of interesting so I've had it on
for what probably like a minute now
and it definitely is turning the lips
pink again it's supposed to be reacting
with your pH levels to turn into the
perfect pink for you so it's kind of
interesting because you know from one
person to the next we probably wouldn't
have these same pink lips they would be
different I just thought it was really
super interesting also I did want to
mention that I actually was sent this
package from Winky Lux because they are
now being sold in forever 21 which
think is really cool so Winkie Lux is
now I believe they're also sold at ASOS
but they are now also found in forever
21 I was sent a diamond complexion
powder which I absolutely love
I was sent out gold liquid eyeliner fell
in love with it
I was sent some glossy lip balms which
weren't my favorites they are a little
too sticky for me but then also matte
velour lip creams which I ended up
really liking too so I will leave my
haul video listed down below so you can
see it and I also do a couple of
Instagram tutorials using like
especially the diamond complexion powder
because that stuff is amazing I was
really excited I had very briefly heard
of the brand Winky locks before but I
didn't know too much about it so I was
excited it was actually forever 21 that
reached out to me which when you get an
email from forever 21 you kind of like
faint a little bit wait what and so they
wanted to send me the package from Winky
Lux since that will now be sold at
forever 21 stores and forever 21 online
so believe everything linked down below
that I can find but I just thought again
this would be kind of a fun at first
impression video to do so now what we
think it's been on for like two minutes
so it definitely is turning my lips pink
I wouldn't say it's like super super
pink right now by any means but it
definitely is not clear it's not just a
clear gloss it definitely has some sort
of pink to it so I don't know how long I
should keep waiting to see how much
Pinker it turns but it's an interesting
concept and I kind of like I kind of
like where it's at right now because if
you can't tell like I'm kind of having a
casual day I'm not feeling well
kind of having a more relaxed day like
this is nice because it's like a little
bit of color but nothing like too
over-the-top but I'm just curious if
it's going to get any darker or if this
is the darkest it's going to get is this
what's considered the perfect pink for
me I don't know because you know
apparently we're all supposed to have
different shades of pink so we will see
but I will wait just a few more minutes
and then check back in with you and we
can see what it looks like and if I
think this is the final and results okay
so it's been about another 5 minutes I
wanted to get this in a before it
completely lost my voice but also
because I'm losing
sunshine outside so I wanted to finish
this up but this is what it looks like
so I haven't noticed a huge change from
when I have to off-camera the first time
I can definitely tell that my lips are
Pinker they're not super pink it doesn't
look like I'm wearing a lipstick or
anything like that but they definitely
have some sort of pink tinge to them
again it's not a ton but what I think
this would be good for is days where you
essentially want something on your lips
but you don't want to deal with the fuss
of a liquid lipstick or even a regular
lipstick or a lip gloss this is a really
nice lip balm it feels very hydrating on
the lips I'm impressed with how
hydrating and how moisturizing it feels
on the lips so that I definitely like
about it but instead of just like doing
something clear you want like a little
bit of umph
that's what I feel like it would be good
for because like I said I don't feel
like it looks like I have like super
bright lipstick on or anything like that
these like color-changing lipsticks I
mean this isn't like the first
color-changing lipstick out there there
have been you know other ones that have
been released as well it just happens to
be the first one that I'm trying these
flower bombs they actually kind of blew
up on the internet I think it was a few
months back I'm really random but the
day that I got this package one of my
aunt's actually posted on my Facebook
page it was a YouTube video of someone
trying out a similar flower balm and she
asked if I had tried it and I was like
well actually I just got one of the mail
so that was really random timing but I
can't pronounce the company's name it
starts with a K I can leave it list it
down below but they came out with these
at $25 and they sold out very fast and
kind of like blew up so these are only
12 dollars which I didn't think was a
bad price at all especially because like
there's so much fun but this could be
something really good for more of an
everyday kind of thing like you just
need to run out the door but you just
want some sort of lip balm on that gives
your lips a little bit of a pink color I
think that's pretty cool
so far as I've been wearing it super
comfortable very hydrating very
moisturizing I think the price is good
at $12 I kind of am curious to see like
maybe if I try another time because I've
read reviews and I watched a few other
videos and people say like the colder
you are the Pinker the lipstick will be
or it might be vice-versa I don't really
remember but I just kind of
wonder like maybe if I'm in a different
setting if I'm out somewhere not just
sitting in my office well I have a
different color pink on my lips I don't
know but I will keep trying it out
because I thought it was a lot of fun
and it feels really nice on the lips so
again this is from Winky Lux there
Flowerbomb once again I'll try to show
you a close-up of the flower inside so
it's really pretty I think it's a really
interesting concept and I just thought
that was really cute they have your
different colors that you can choose
from again I will leave this link down
below to Winky look so you can also find
Winky Lux at forever 21 now as well
which is really cool again it said the
next shipment will go out November 29th
but they do expect to sell out before
then so if you want to get this I would
get this soon and I'm really curious
have you guys tried flower bombs have
you tried like the color-changing
lipsticks I was excited to give it a try
and my first impression like I think
it's pretty cool I don't know if I would
consider it like life-changing or a must
need or anything like that but I just
think it's a really fun concept and I do
like the color that it turned my lips
looks like a really nice pink and the
biggest thing for me though is that I
like how it feels on my lips it feels
very very hydrating and especially with
winter coming up here in Iowa like that
is what I need so overall I think it's a
really cool product thank you too Winky
last and forever 21 for reaching out for
me being able to try this video is not
sponsored I just decided I would make it
when I got the feedback that I did on my
snapchat that a lot of people were
interested in this one so I decided to
try it out if you'd like to see the rest
of my Winky Lux hull I can leave that
linked in the description box below
because they have some really cool
products and I was pretty darn excited
to find a new brand that I liked so much
and especially now that it's also at
4:21 I think that's pretty cool
but again the Winky looks flower bomb
gets a thumbs up in my book pretty darn
cool let me know if you're interested in
getting it or if you already have one I
would love to know thank you guys so
