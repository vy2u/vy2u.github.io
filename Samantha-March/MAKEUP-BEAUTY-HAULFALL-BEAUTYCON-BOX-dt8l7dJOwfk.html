in today's video I'm just going to be
doing a new hall I picked up a few
products for myself I've gotten sent a
few things and I also have the fall
beautycon box that I want to share with
you guys and I let you guys see what is
in default beautycon box so you can
decide if you want to purchase the box
for yourself I got sent the summer one
and thought it was amazing so I was
really excited to get the ball one and
I'm excited to go through it with you
hell if you want to see my most recent
haul please keep watching that I
received is from stanford now sanford
actually did reach out to me and asked
if they could send me like their month
supply of perfume and i said yes this is
not a sponsored video from any of these
companies i'll be talking about even if
they have sent me products this is a no
i sponsored by any of these companies
but sent fer did just email me and ask
you know we're interested in having you
try outs and bird and see what you think
of it you know would you like us to send
you the one month sample and I said sure
I thought about it for a little bit
because i'm not a huge huge perfume
person like I owned really nice perfumes
and I spray perfumes but I think I tend
to forget to put perfume on because they
are still upstairs in my bedroom and
that's where I used to get ready i used
to get ready in my bathroom upstairs but
i moved my entire makeup collection down
here into my office and so oftentimes i
get ready down here and then i just head
out the door and I'm like a little
forgot perfume again so I always find
myself like asking my friends like once
were out of my could you be perfume I
could borrow because I still do want to
wear it I just always forget it so I've
thought about it for a little bit so I
was like you know is this gonna be a
good fit for me but that you know
there's really no like risk and trying
it like why not just give the one want
to try see how I like it see how it goes
babs beauty very frequently and she had
just put up a new perfume video so I
washed hers and I picked out one of the
sense that she had mentioned in there
then that I picked out is versace bright
crystal so the way sent bird works it's
basically a service where you can try
different perfumes and each month you
can pick a different perfume scent and
they will send you a new little bottle
and it's supposed to last you for 30
days so you can try it out that was an
interesting concept so I
decided to say yes and so I just got my
little sent bird in the mail so it came
in this black package and then it does
come with a card so it says howdy to use
you twist to spray and twist to close
just like a lipstick so when I get it
out this is what like the packaging
looks like and dust i sent bird right
here and then all you do is actually
twist it and then you can see like the
little spray nozzle right there and then
you twist it down to close so I thought
that was pretty fun and then to replace
it it says you twist and pull the old
vile up to remove oh okay so you just
pulled this out oh I see so there that
says it versace bright crystal and then
so when you get your next one in the
next month i think they just send you
like this file and then you would put it
in your your little package already so
that's pretty cool the thing that kind
of like frustrated me when i first got
this and i was going to do this video i
was like oh shoot i don't remember what
sent that I picked and so I went back to
the email but if you just pull it up it
does say it right on there for you so
that's good to know you can go into your
profile you can like rate the different
perfumes you can make a different q of
sense that you might want to try I found
the website really really easy to go
over because it talks about the
different notes uh you know do you want
something fruity or feminine or sexy or
natural like it just it was really
helpful because I'm not like I said I'm
not like a huge perfume person I don't
really understand a lot about perfume
and picking out a perfume so I actually
thought kind of like third guy that they
had on the website was very very helpful
to me because I was a little overwhelmed
so I just got this two days ago and what
I will say so far i will say that i
really like the scent like I kept
catching myself throughout the day like
all of a sudden I'd smell me I'm like oh
what is that that smells nice so versace
bright crystal i really do like that one
it's more of a fruity send olivos under
the fruity section but what i like about
this is that i have found myself like
remembering to put this in my purse so
it's not a huge bottle by any means that
it looks like so it's not huge by any
means because my other perfume bottles
that I have are quite larger and I don't
want to put them in my purse this one is
really easy to just put in like the
front pocket of my purse and so
hopefully I can keep remembering to do
that so I can actually go through the
bottle like see what I really do think
about this scent but so far that's what
I really like about this that's going to
be a small enough to be able to put into
my bag so we will see I'm excited for it
I'm excited to keep trying it the
website was really easy to go through i
like the concept of it and then looking
on the website so it says you get a 30
day supply of any designer fragrance
every single month for 1495 a month
missing that's a really fun way to be
truck being able to try different
perfumes like a fear of someone who
really is into perfume and you like
trying out the different sense like 30
days for 1495 for the designer perfume
like that's actually really not a bad
deal because perfume is very very
expensive like i said i only own like to
designer perfumes and they were both
gifted to me because I was like I can't
spend that much money so to be able to
try them out especially when I have one
that like I spray it I'm like I can't
tell if I smell like an old lady or not
I kind of think I do though so I don't
gravitate towards that when a whole lot
but this is really cool to be able to
try it out the sense to know if you
would actually want to spend that type
of money on a designer perfume you know
that it's going to be one that you love
i will go ahead i will leave a link to
the scent bird website down below like i
said i'm not an affiliate with them i'm
not getting paid or anything like that
so i will leave a link down to semper it
down below if you are interested in
trying out i'm sure you guys have
probably heard about it but this is my
first time trying it so I'm quite
excited I'll keep you updated on what I
think of my sense I got this cute pink
package in the mail and it says hello on
it and then when I opened it up I had
three different little boxes in here and
I've been waiting to do a haul video
before I really like took notice of what
what I was doing so the little card that
was sent just says hi Samantha I hope
you'll enjoy our products that foreign
hearing from you say hello to sexy legs
so this company did ask if they could
send me a package and I said yes because
I was interested in trying these
products out again that sponsored
napping paid know that so the say hello
to sexy legs first they sent along the
tinted
glow gel so that's what that one looks
like it says it's instant perfect legs
transfer resistant tinted lotion says
it's not a self-tanner and for all skin
tones like this is a step system so it
says three steps for slimmer looking
sexier legs and this is step one
designed to deliver an instant
natural-looking bronze glow the tinted
glow gel moisturizes and soften skins
while helping to cover imperfections and
even the skin texture it's formulated
with caffeine and green tea to help
correct the appearance of cellulite and
it's designed for all skin tones
perfectly perfect looking legs for a day
so as you just apply the gel gel are
silly all over the legs and let ajar for
35 minutes before putting clothes on
it's transfer resistant will not staying
close and you can wash it off with soap
and water ok ok so then moving on to
step 2 this is illuminating fluid it's a
leg highlighter so let's see it says
it's designed to instantly deliver a
beautiful highlight illuminating fluid
collides weightlessly onto the skin to
leave a shimmering youthful glow it's
formulated with caffeine and greet tea
is suitable for all skin tones and you
play on targeted areas of the leg from
the upper thigh to kneecap and shin for
a radiant light reflecting and perfected
skin texture ok I'm into this I'm into
this and then for the final step step 3
this is a contour stick and it says leg
definer so it says portable and easy to
use the contour stick adds definition
and depth to your legs by situating
bustle lines it's ultra light texture
blends easily into the skin and use the
contour stick to sculpt him to find the
thighs and calves it's wide stick
applicator is specifically designed for
the legs so like contouring I saw like I
saw some stuff about like contouring a
while back on like Instagram and such
and thought it was pretty interesting so
let me actually open up each of the
packages so I can show you what the
product looks like ok so this is the
step 1 so that is the tinted glow gel
that you put all over the legs and then
step 2 this is the leg highlighter and
then here is the contour stick so I'm
definitely curious to give this a try
that's just like a big old contour sick
i'm curious to give this a try to see
what it looks like especially for events
where you have to wear like a
sir shorter dress this could be really
interesting I will definitely be trying
this out thank you to say hello to sexy
legs for sending me this package such a
fun concept before I get on to the
beautycon box i purchased just two
things for myself recently no big deal
first is the Vegas Nate and I lower
lashes and grand glamour I have these
lashes and I love them and they're
always sold out I saw this one pair of
target the other day and I was like I am
taking them I am obsessed with these
lashes the other thing that I picked up
for myself is from Kylie cosmetics it is
one of her matte liquid lipsticks in the
shade exposed it is what I'm wearing on
my lips right now so I have purchased
from cali cosmetics before three of her
like original lip glosses and I also
have the matte lipstick in kandi kay and
I really love this formula of the matte
liquid lipsticks I just never want it to
pay ten dollars for shipping because I
think that's just silly an extreme and I
just want to do it and I held strong
onto that even though she's coming out
some great colors and everyone was
watching him when we're in him I thought
they looked beautiful but I was like
don't do it don't you pay ten dollars
for shipping because you do not live
that life Samantha don't do it and then
one day Kylie said hey for like 20 i
think it was 24 hours she said free
shipping on everything and I was like
sign me up thank you and I also really
liked it because with her matte liquid
lipsticks when they first came out they
were in the lip kit which came with the
lip liner and the liquid lipstick and
they're like twenty nine dollars and I'm
like mmm like I didn't mind it the first
time but I was like I really don't wear
lip liners very frequently at all maybe
like one out of every seven times I wear
lipsticks I put lip liner on so a lot of
her like first shades that she came out
with in liquid lipstick form she now has
them in the singles and exposed as one
of them I did want a few other shades
from her like more recent color launches
but those are still only sold in the lip
kits and I was like I just don't need
the lip liners be strong Samantha just
wait for it so I ended up just getting
exposed and like I said it's the color
of my lips right now the lighting the
sounds kind of going down
so the Lighting's going a little crazy
but I really love it it's just a very
pretty nude I Love New it's a shade
looked gorgeous when I first came out a
while back I was like I want that so bad
so when she offered free shipping i was
so excited i hope that she does more
free shipping in the future because
hopefully like I just really hope the
orders for like so high that day that
she was like I should do this more often
because I would totally purchase more
but I just didn't want to pay ten
dollars for shipping I think the single
liquid lipstick was like seventeen
dollars which I also didn't think was
bad because i buy an Estancia and kat
von d liquid lipsticks in their 20 so I
didn't think 17 was a bad price so far
this is my first time up wearing exposed
and I think it's absolutely gorgeous
I'll keep playing with it I love this
formula it's one of my favorite out of
liquid lipsticks formulas so excited
that I got exposed things that I want to
go through is my beauty combox this is
the fall beauty convox I was so excited
to get this box because I was actually
sent the summer box and I did an
unboxing video here on YouTube and I was
so excited when they reached out to me
again and said hey you know would you be
interested in sending you the fall box
again na sponsored video I'm not being
paid they didn't even say that I needed
to do a video on it but I wanted to
share it with you guys because I'm new
to these beautycon boxes the summer one
was the first one that I ever received
and I thought it was amazing so I was
really excited to get the fall box our
annual boxes so they come four times a
year this is the fall box each box has
like a curator so you know someone who
is picking out the products and this
month I think this is the first month
that there were two so it is angel and
makeup Shayla also do get a list of
everything that is in the Box there's no
prices on it but it has the brand and
what they are and then also this came
out in the summer 12 there's like a
portrait of whoever is the curator so
there is Angel and makeup Shayla and
then the box also came like everything
was wrapped in this like gold packaging
which I don't remember there being like
any sort of packaging from the last box
I think everything was just kind of like
stuffed in there so it was like ooh
that's fancy so you get some stickers I
don't really know what exactly I would
do with these stickers but I thought
they were pretty funny in there was also
a pin in here from laser
hittin and it's just like a little
lipstick pin and then also I was really
I was really excited for these you get
some cleansing facial wipes from simple
so this is what they look like I love
facial wipes I can't help it guys
especially even to keep down here you
use them like on my face especially when
traveling but it's really also handy to
have in my office or if I'm ever doing
any swatches really handy so I'm like a
hoarder of facial wipes so good stuff
also in here was an eyeshadow from
Milani and it is in bella cappuccino so
it's a really pretty brown color I have
quite a few of these Bella I shadows
from Milani and i'm pretty much positive
i have cappuccino so i'll probably be
putting this in a future giveaway it's
just a really nice matte brown shade and
i really do like these shadows from
Milani i think these were the first
shadows that I ever tried from Milani
and they're good ones so also in here i
did a unboxing on my snapchat as well if
you don't follow me on snapchat i am
Samantha got march maybe you'll follow
me over there because we have a lot of
fun and i did an unboxing and i pulled
these out my there sugarfina sugar lips
so these are what they look like and I'm
like these candy do I eat them I haven't
decided yet I'm pretty sure they have to
be candy because like why else I mean
like sugar lips it has to be candy right
but I've been waiting to do this video's
like show you guys them then I'm
probably going to eat them because I
love sugar and I loved candy and I want
to eat these so also in the fall
beautycon box this is from the brow gel
by tonya crooks it's a double-ended
shimmer matte gold nude highlighter
pencil so this is what it looks like and
then when you open it up it is just like
a dual end it pencil so you have like
the gold side on one end and then a nude
on the other so I'm assuming it's meant
almost like the highbrow from benefit to
click clean up under your brows or
highlight under your brows so very fun
so this is from Mystic Tan it's the
confident flirty kissed customizable
bronzer so it's a mocha kissed bronzer
lotion so this is what it looks like
there was also like a face self-tanner
and the Sun
box and this one is supposed to be I
think for all over your body let's give
you a tan look so might be trying this
out soon this product is from you way it
is their essential lip enhancer so
that's what the packaging looks like
also says it's a conditioning lip
treatment it says the load it with
clinically proven maxi lip to increase
bonus of lips while decreasing the fine
lines excellent I also got a brush which
really excited me because I do love
getting brushes this is from Luxy it's
the 504 large angled brush and to take
it out of the packaging this is what it
looks like I will be keeping this brush
so I am super excited it's very soft
looks to be good for contour or even
blush I love brushes so really excited
to get this so also in there we're
getting a liquid lipstick from ofra
that's one of their long lasting liquid
lipsticks and the shade is in mocha so
it looks to be like a brown nude shade I
haven't decided yet if I'm going to keep
this I think I am because I've never
tried the over liquid lipsticks before
but just in case I don't want to swatch
it yet in case I decided we'll go in a
giveaway but over lipstick I thought
that was pretty cool and then the final
two things that were in the fall beauty
combox are for lashes I love lashes so
that's really excited me so in the box
are these flutter lashes they are the I
slay lashes so they are in collaboration
with makeup Shayla and flutter lashes
really excited to try these I know she
also did the sleigh low lashes I believe
they are both flutter lashes and I hear
a lot of good things about them so I'm
really excited to try out the isolate
and I just I love lashes so that's
awesome then it also came with some
eyelash adhesive so this is from duo it
does say it's clear way I'm a little
hesitant on white eyelash adhesive but
I'll try it and see if it does dry clear
but really excited to try these lashes I
thought was pretty cool that they
included some adhesive as well so that's
everything that's in the fall beauty
