today's video I'm going to be doing a
makeup and beauty haul is basically
going to be a PR house so these are all
items these companies have sent to me to
try to review and test out and give my
thoughts on it's not a sponsored video
at all none of these companies are
paying me to talk about their products
or even saying that I had to make a
video about it sometimes I don't feature
all of like the PR and then like very
nice packages that I get and I'll just
kind of do like unboxings and stuff on
snapchat but actually in this past week
I've had quite a few packages come in
and I thought hey this could actually
make like a decent video and I'm
actually kind of really excited about
some of these products that I've got so
i thought i would share them with you
yeah if you'd like to see I recent
makeup beauty haul of mine please keep
watching ceived a skin care package from
i am not sure how to say this company's
name and I've been talking to him and I
totally should have asked hey how do you
pronounce your name but let's say sorry
crane fell clean so please make
fettuccine on ease on right is that even
if it fell hmm but this is what it looks
like they sent me like three full-size
products here and then they also sent me
too many guys of like masks to try out
I've actually been trying these products
for a full week now this has been like
my skincare routine so what I do in the
morning is I start off with their d taxi
smooth multi-action mild foam gel
cleanser looks like this this feels
really nice it says you can use it daily
it has natural fruit acids and cotton
stem cells and it's for all skin types
and it says texture revitalizing which
is like what kind of like sparks my
interest in this personally so I've been
using this every single morning I've
been really liking it so far I do have
sensitive skin it's not you're attaining
to my skin at all it just feels really
nice it's a good size bottle to this is
five fluid ounces so this is an
instantly refreshing cleansing gel to
gently sweep away pore clogging
impurities dead skin cells and
environmental contaminants that lead to
imperfections says it's a blend of
natural fruit acids to Delhi to
delicately refine skins
pictures revealing a clean smooth and
radiant complexion with every cleanse so
this is what I've been using in the
morning and then immediately following
that I use their luster refine ultra
texture perfecting treatment moisturizer
and this stuff smells delicious the
first time I used it I was like what is
that because it smells so good so it
says this is lightweight luminous finish
and clarifying an anti-wrinkle 30 is
creeping in on me real hard you guys so
and this is what i use in the morning
after i use the cleanser and then at
night typically after i remove my makeup
and wash my face i put on there Lily
bright see their multi fade and firm
corrective complex with vitamin C and
beat and orange stem cells if you guys
follow me on snapchat a lot of times i
will share like my skin care whatever it
is so i'm using and i always always
always share a vitamin c i love vitamin
c huge fan of vitamin C so when I got
this I was like thank you so much so
this gradually fades multiple signs of
discoloration and sun induce aging while
boosting firming fibers within skin
structure so very very excited to
receive this so again that's kind of how
i've been using it in my skincare
routine i also sent along like two mini
masks to try out and one is the multi
pulp gel puri triple resurfacing mask
and polish this is really interesting
because when you put it on it's
basically like you don't see anything
except like little black seeds all over
your face it was kind of cool and then
the other ones i sent is their black mud
mask with charcoal so this is what it
looks like i actually used this other
night I thought this was really
interesting because I use a lot of
different charcoal masks but this one
was different because it has almost like
it feels like exfoliants and they're
like you know like the Freddy is in
there I've never have that with the
charcoal mask before so I've used the
multi pulp one twice now and I've only
will use it once per week because I
could tell like even though it really
didn't seem like you have a lot going on
on your skin those little exfoliants are
really doing a good job because when I
washed off my face was kind of red and
like i said i do have sensitive skin so
i would only use this once a week
because you I could tell like it was
getting work done and then I actually
just used this the night before I'm
filming so
it felt nice going on like I said you
know it's the charcoal mask but I had a
little bit more to it it felt nice it
didn't leave my skin as red as the pulp
one which I thought was interesting but
i will keep drawing these out but so far
I've really been having a good
experience with these they have a very
nice line it's very like luxurious
skincare i will leave the website linked
below but so far these are doing well
for me and i also received some sheet
masks from beauty stones it says unearth
your inner beauty and they sent me their
green tea facial masks that says
revitalize your scandalous natural green
tea extract so these are what they look
like right here they sent me two of them
says jude series anti-acne been really
really into sheet masks lately so I was
super excited to get this I've been
waiting since I decided I was going to
do this haul video I was waiting to haul
these before I use them but I'm really
excited about it looking forward to
trying these out big fan of sheet masks
so i will try these and give you guys an
update probably either on snapchat or in
a future video i received another
product from grayson Stella I've talked
about Grayson Stella before and I'm
talking about the Mont stop shop quite a
bit I received some eye masks from them
I'm completely obsessed with the eye
masks I recommend them all the time a
lot of times I share photos of me or
snaps in the morning and I have the eye
masks on I think they're super fantastic
so grace and Stella actually reach out
to me again and I said can we send you
something else and I said sure I looked
on their website and i saw this flicked
exploiting mask and I was like yeah
let's let's send me that and see what
this is all about so as you get one pair
in here for soft smooth feet so it looks
like you put plastic booties on both
your feet secure the booties around each
ankle where the plastic booties for one
hour to allow the products to absorb and
after one hour you remove the plastic
booties and wash your feet with soap the
dead skin cells will begin to peel from
five to seven days after initial
application I'm really curious to try
this out because I've actually tried
something very similar from a different
brand and it did absolutely nothing for
me and I remembered feeling really upset
because it takes a while to put these on
so it sounds like what's inside the
booty has the actual product in it I
remember the other thing that I use in
the past
I had to put that all over my feet and
then put the booties on so huh maybe
that's the way it works I don't know
I'll have to see but I'm thinking about
possibly like filming a little video for
it's either talk about an upcoming
review or maybe just to do like a
one-minute video on Instagram to see
what it's about but I wanted to share it
in this how first before I do it but
look for that coming soon because if
this works I would be super super
excited about it as a lucky one chosen
to be a part of the Max Factor their new
campaign that they have going on I was
really excited when I got the email
asking if I would like to receive this
box and of course I was like yes so I
recently got this and it had a nice
little card in here kind of explaining
what was all going on because so on the
card here it says max factor was the
original inventor of modern makeup and
the very first artist to start his own
brand which is very cool as we're
bringing a limited edition capsule
collection to the United States this
August featuring a select edit of
glamour essentials and it says working
with creative designer director pat
mcgrath pretty cool this exclusive
collection was developed to be a fresh
modern take on an iconic glamour look
the sexy cat I paired with a nude or
rose colored lip and so you get a
mascara a high-precision liquid eyeliner
into a dynamic max factor at lipstick
shades so I thought that was really neat
so in the box we have the mascara and
then the eyeliner which I am so excited
to try out this liquid liner yes please
and then it came with these two
lipsticks as well so one is in maroon
dust that's pretty this is the first
time I'm watching them so that right
there is maroon dust and then the other
one is in simply nude oh that's a pretty
nude if you like nudes that is a very
pretty like pinky nude so those are the
two lipstick shades that came with and
those are very pretty so again I've been
waiting to do this haul video but I
think the next look that I do want to
try to incorporate all these different
pieces in here and see what kind of cat
look I can come up with I just thought
that was a really exciting like launch
and I think it was coming into stores
like as of august first so it should be
available to get I will find any links
that I can and leave them link down
below but really excited to be a part of
this campaign very excited to try out
these new maxfactor items so look for
some photos coming soon and then I got a
very large package in the mail the other
day and it is from Prine dot me plus x
havea and it says i'm getting an ex
tevia product preview about the brand
xav is on a mission to make every day
your perfect hair day and so they sent
along a jet set travel hair dryer at jet
set travel iron and a two-in-one magic
wand it came like all wrapped up like
this like I mean I'm not kidding when my
husband brought in the Box I was like
what in the actual world is in that box
I had no idea I actually got the email
saying that I was selected for the
campaign after I got the box so I was
like what's what's going on okay so that
packaging was like no joke it's like one
of those things Rose like a box instead
of a box inside of a box inside of a box
but that was wild does the bag the hair
dryer comes with so that's that's pretty
cool and then when you open it up so
this is what the inside of it looks like
the hair dryer is black and then I
believe it comes with a diffuser as well
which is really nice I actually don't
have a diffuser so that will be really
interesting to try out but it's a nice
like mini size because this is supposed
to be good for traveling and on the go
this is the two and one magic one it's a
curling iron and a straightener combined
into one chic compact wand so that's
pretty interesting it also came with
four hair clips which I thought was
pretty cool and then this one is the
flat iron as well so you can see they're
all like kind of like mini compact
supposed to be good for on-the-go and
then this also came for hair clips which
I'm really excited cuz actually don't
own any of those like type of hair clips
so that is really exciting so that is
everything that I got from xscape you
and I'm really excited to try some of
these out I don't use heat on my hair a
whole lot but sometimes I simply have to
a lot of times for like special
occasions I will curl my hair so I'm
interested to try that too and one right
there
just to kind of have like new products
my hair dryer that I use is one that I
took from my mother when I went to
college like my I don't even know how
many years my mom had it but I went off
to college I was like I'm gonna need to
take the hair dryer so that'll be nice i
gotta have a different the newer hair
dryer in my collection but i'm really
excited to take part of that so i will
be doing some like upcoming hair
tutorials and things like that on
Instagram so look out for those as well
one last thing i got is from dorko and i
lost the card that came with it but it
told me how to pronounce this i think
it's like shoe dorko shoe or sue now i
can't remember but it is a razor and
it's so weird because i got like real
excited over this i'm not going to lie
because I mean I know we don't talk
about like a razors and shaving a lot on
our channels but I know one time I did
mention a razor as a fail in one of my
videos like I was so mad at it might
even Bend like an empties video I was
like I just bought this razor but I'm
throwing it away because I mean hello
like we need razors so I'm excited to
try this out says it's a lubricating
band with triple formula I'm to protect
sensitive skin which I really really
like that part six blades but I have
just been waiting you need to do this
haul video to open this up because this
is one of the first products sieved when
I decided I was going to do the haul
video so I've been holding off and
opening it but I'm really excited to
give this a try so again it'll probably
be either in a review video of my show
up in my beauty newsletter where i do
reviews but i will link to this down
below in case maybe you're looking for
new grazer alright guys and that was
going to be everything for this at PR
hall like i said i don't do these types
of halls a lot but i actually haven't
really done a whole lot of halls lately
because i've kind of been on a no x
because they've just been doing a couple
giveaways here and there I did the big
back to school giveaway and I currently
have the 5k giveaway going on right now
so I've been buying for that and I'm
also trying to save up to buy a ring
light so I haven't been doing a whole
lot of like makeup shopping right now so
I thought hey why not be able to do a
haul but to show you some of the the
products that I've been so kindly sent
to from these companies and like I said
everything will be linked down below it
will do my best to find any sort of
links that i can and i will link
down below in case you are interested
and any of the products are received or
you want to talk further into the
companies I'm excited to be able to
share this hall with you and I just feel
very thankful whenever I get a package
in the mail it's like Christmas no
matter where it's coming from or who is
coming from or what's inside I just
always feel so incredibly a thankful so
really excited that I was able to make
this video for you guys if you did like
