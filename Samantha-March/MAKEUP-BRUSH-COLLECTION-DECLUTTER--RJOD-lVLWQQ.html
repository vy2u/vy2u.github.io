today's video is going to be my makeup
brush declutter oh man okay so recently
I mentioned in a video that I really
needed to do a brush declutter and I had
so many comments of people asking if I
was going to film it would I please film
it and I'm like of course I am I am a
beauty youtuber I cannot do anything
with my makeup collection without
filming it for you guys so today's video
is going to be my brush to clutter I
have a lot of brushes I love makeup
brushes I love buying makeup brushes I
love collecting makeup brushes it's just
always been one of my my happy things
but this clearly needs some work so
let's jump into it but when I store my
makeup brushes I kind of try to store
them in somewhat of order and I kind of
have them laid out here like a lot of
these are like my bigger face brushes my
smaller face brushes we have like a
bunch of my blending brushes are paired
together like my smaller detail brushes
are together my like flat shader brush
is are together you know things like
that so hopefully they'll be like
somewhat of order to this video I'll
have my declutter playlist listed down
below as always and I can't link all of
the brushes because you only have so
much space in your description boxes but
I'll try to link you know maybe some of
my favorite brush brands and things like
that but let's go ahead and jump in so
okay so these ones here are from morphe
this is the art ooh I love this for a
bronzer brush it's one of my absolute
favorites I would not get rid of this
this one is the m5 27 and I actually
don't like this one from morphe this one
sheds on me a lot and it's just not my
favorite bronzer brush and I'm super
disappointed because a lot of people
seem to like this one and I just don't
so I'm gonna go ahead and put that one
in my past pile for her to clutters if I
receive something and I don't enjoy it I
mean makeup brushes I think maybe it's a
little bit easier to put on Poshmark but
if I've bought something and I'm not
going to use it anymore I can put it on
my Poshmark or send it friends and
family if I did get something in PR
typically I will just pass along to
friends family things like that okay so
this one here is the Sigma f30 this is
the large powder brush I use this as
bronzer you see this in so many of my
tutorials it's one of my
it's definitely gonna keep that one this
one here is also from Sigma it's the
Baek precision P 89 you know I just
don't really use this brush a ton I used
to when I used like loose setting powder
a lot I would use this the pack loose
setting powder on and I don't do that a
whole ton anymore and I don't really
reach for this brush a lot so I'll put
that in the past pile this one here is
from a Sephora this is the 57 airbrush
what is it the airbrush concealer one of
my absolute holy cure holy grail brushes
I love this brush it always comes
traveling with me
yes keeping that one this one here is
from Delhi imposes the power blending I
started using it as bronzer and I didn't
love it
sometimes I've used it I was like powder
I don't feel like I have like the best
use for this brush which means that I
just don't use it a ton so I'm going to
go ahead and put that one in the past
pile I have these two here from Mota
this is when they're the mono metallic
line and again you see me use these
brushes really frequently we have the
contour brush and then the buffer brush
I actually use it for contour and then
also for bronzer and I just really
enjoyed these brushes so I'm going to
keep that this one here is from Sigma
Sigma it's the angled cream at contour
the F 61
I don't really cream a contour a ton I
think this just came in one of the sets
Sigma's kind of hard because I do get a
lot of PR from them but I also buy a lot
of Sigma brushes myself and I buy a lot
of sets and sometimes I want every
single brush out of there and sometimes
I do not but that's just the way it goes
but since because I don't do that step
and I just don't really have a use for
this one I'm going to put it into my
past pile okay this one here is the elf
I think this is the 104 contour brush
from the beautifully precise line I
really do like this one I use it for
contour a lot so I'm going to keep that
one this one here is from Real
Techniques this is the expert face brush
I really do like this one and I use it
for like my pressed powder a lot to
apply press powder all over my face and
that's a step I do a lot in the summer
so I'm gonna hold onto that one I have
this one here from Luxy it's the large
angled 504 you know it's interesting
because I have brushes like this in my
collection and I use them for blush
quite a bit but this one I just don't
really
love and I just don't reach for at a
time I think this came in like one of my
subscription bags and yeah I just don't
really use it so I'm gonna pass that one
on I do have this one here from Lexie
and I know I have another one there it
is I have two of these brushes from
Lexie the 522 tapered highlighter I
think both of these came in subscription
boxes but I love these brushes for
highlight I love that I have two you're
gonna see me keep a lot of the same
brushes and I do that because then I
don't have to constantly be washing my
favorite brushes if I have you know
multiple ones especially when it comes
to eye brushes I definitely have several
of my favorite eye brushes that way it's
just I'm not continually washing them
and putting them through that you know
it was four brushes so yeah I'm
definitely an acute both of these I use
that brush quite a bit this one here is
from Sigma this is the tapered
highlighter the f-35 I do really enjoy
this highlight brush as well so I'm
going to keep that one I know I have
multiple dose I'm gonna try I'm gonna
try my best not to keep too many of the
same one if I don't need it a ton for
that particular use if that makes sense
this is from morphe this is the e4 this
is one of my favorite blush brushes I
use this so often so I'm gonna keep that
one this one here is from Sigma this is
the tapered face the F 25 I remember I
bought this because I kept seeing like
some people use either this exact brush
or something really similar to it in
tutorials and they would use it to like
dust away baking powder and I was like I
have to have that brush and I just don't
really use it a lot so I was like well
that was kind of silly so I'm gonna go
ahead and pass that one hon okay so this
one here this is another f-35 from Sigma
so I'm gonna keep this one for now I
would like a couple of them but if I
have like six or something then I'll try
to do it but our job but I'm gonna go
ahead and put that on my keep pile for
right now this one here is from morphe
this is the g2 I really like the g2 for
concealer but I've noticed that I have
not reached for this for a long time
like as I was picking this one up I'm
like wait what one is this again it's
just a little bit larger I have one from
Sigma that's similar to it but it's
smaller and I like it more for concealer
so I'm actually going to put this one in
my past pile this is the one from Sigma
that I was talking about this is the F
79 the concealer
blonde kabuki I love this one for
concealer I like though it's just
smaller it's easier to blend out so I'm
going to keep that one this one here is
from Pixie the Merriam NYC collaboration
it's their strobe and sculpt brushes I
like this and I do think that it's a
good brush but I barely reached for it
and I don't love storing double-ended
brushes I don't have a good place for
that so I'm going to go ahead and put
that one in my past pile this one here
is from morphe it's the m42 7 this one
is a duo fiber I use this quite a bit
especially when I would use color pop
there are super shocked blushes because
it has that kind of different texture
formula to it but I really don't use
this a ton can't really member the last
time I used it so that's gonna go in my
past file this one here is from Sigma
this is the large large angled contour
f40 I use this for blush and I
absolutely love it
again I probably have a few of these but
one of my favorite blush brushes I'm
going to keep that one this one here
this was a real techniques brush and
it's really beautiful and sparkly this
is the 302 but this is a brush style
that I just don't use a whole ton and I
think I have some other brushes in there
so I'm actually going to pass this one
on it's really pretty I'm sure someone
else with a little bit more than I do
see this is a really similar brush to it
this is the morphe 49 and I actually do
use this one quite a bit I take it
traveling quite a bit I use this to pack
on powder to set my concealer whether it
be a pressed powder or a loose powder
and I really like this brush for that so
I'm going to keep that one this one here
is from Stella's ax it's the strobe L
3:07 a big reason to I wanted to do this
to clutters because they actually just
sent me a ton of brushes
I haven't even gone through them yet
you're not going to see the majority of
those brushes in here because I'm like
you have to cut down your collection you
don't even have spot to like store all
of these but they sent me a package
prior to that and had just a few brushes
in there so I have some of them in here
so again this is a highlight brush I'm
gonna go ahead and keep it because I am
planning to review these brushes in like
a future in d-brane reviews video so I'm
gonna hang on to this one for right now
this one here is the Sigma strobing fan
brush the f40 - I don't love fan brushes
to apply my highlighter but I also don't
have a ton
so I'm not gonna go ahead and keep this
one for the days that I want to but I
really only need like one in my
collection so if I have more I can
declutter that this one here is the
Sigma powder sweep the fo6
I really enjoy this one for contour and
I reach for it quite a bit so I'm gonna
keep that one okay we have another f-35
so this one this one has like some
sparkle in it it was part of their ether
there is the night life collection okay
so I'm going to keep this f-35 but if I
have another f-35 in my collection I'm
gonna go ahead and pass it off okay this
one here is from Dell um-- tools this is
the tapered contour 944 it reminds me a
little bit of that f-35 it's just a
little bit bigger and you can really
either use it for contour or for
highlight I really do like a lot of the
w m-- tools brushes that I've tried I
think they're very underrated brand and
they have some really nice brushes this
is part of the Golden Triangle set and
I'm gonna go ahead and keep this one
this is another one from DeLeon tools
this is they're slanted precision
precision kabuki the 956 it kind of
reminds me a bit of like the f80 from
sigma it's just a little bit smaller and
then it has the slant on it again though
I just don't use this type of brush a
whole ton so I'm gonna put that in my
path pile and then this one here is from
Sigma it's the high cheekbone
highlighter it's the fl3 I absolutely
love this brush for highlighting I think
it is my favorite highlight brush I
probably have a lot of these in my
collection and I know I just purchased
Angelica's collection as well and it
came with another fo3 so this might have
to be another one that I pay attention
to how many I'm keeping but I really
really do enjoy that brush this is
another Sigma f40 but this is the mini
version of it I take this one traveling
with me quite a bit and I love it I'm
going to keep that one here we go we got
another fo3 so I'm gonna go ahead and
hang on to that one so we got to fo 3s
up here's another fo three so I think
one of these came in
Angelica's collection but you know what
it's fine I really enjoyed those brush
so threes three is not too bad
I'll go ahead and keep that one okay
this here is the Sigma curved kabuki the
F 83 so you can see this curve in here
again it's just not a brush I reach for
a ton so I think I can put that one in
the past pile I have probably a couple
of 80s here at the f80 was my like very
first brush I ever purchased from Sigma
it's my OG and it's one of my absolute
favorites and probably my most
recommended face brush that I give to
people from Sigma and this is one that
they came out when they were doing like
a special breast cancer awareness and
that's really important to me so I'm
definitely gonna be keeping the pink one
they also just sent me a new one and it
does have my my Instagram handle
engraved on it which I thought was
pretty cool except it says world instead
of word but you know that's cool
so thought that counts so I'm gonna go
ahead and keep that one since that is
personalized and then this is another
f80 this is their five-year anniversary
edition brush so I'm gonna go ahead and
keep that one so I think we got three F
80s now so that's probably pretty good
for my F 80s this one here is the 3d HD
max kabuki I love this brush it's huge
it has like these different angles and
such in it but when I I kind of go back
and forth on how I like to apply my
foundation I either love brushes or I
love beauty blenders when I love brushes
I reach for this one so often it's super
quick to get your foundation done so I
definitely want to keep that one this is
the morphe M 439 I used to use this a
ton for foundation but I find myself not
really reaching for it anymore I'm
mostly rooting for the Kabuki so I'm
actually gonna put that one in the past
pile I'm trying I'm trying to be good
okay so this is the Sigma angled kabuki
that f-84 I actually do like this one
for foundation and when I used to use
cream products I would use this for like
cream contour and such too so I do like
this one I'm gonna go ahead and keep it
this is the morphe III this is one of my
favorite brushes I use this a lot to
apply powder like if I'm applying powder
all over my face to set my foundation I
use this brush and I really enjoy it so
I'm going to keep that one this one here
is from Delhi impose this is the tapered
powder 974 so this kind of reminds me of
the was at the Sigma or morphe that I
did cluttered that was like this but
this is a little bit bigger and it's
like a little bit fluffier and a lot of
times I've been reaching for this to
kind of blend on my makeup together so
I'm gonna hold on to that one this is
another one here from Real Techniques
and again it's just not
that like a brush style that I reached
for a ton so I'm gonna go ahead and pass
that one on this one here is from Mac
this is the 140s I think is what that
one is this is a fairly newer brush that
was sent to me from Mac and I would
really like to try it out so this is a
new one to me so I'm gonna go ahead and
hold on to that one this one here is the
winged aligner ao6 this is a really
great window liner brush if you are
really into it so I might have to see
how many of these I have but I
definitely want to keep one around in my
collection for what I do want to do when
de liner
okay so this one is the Sigma 3d HD Max
Kilby ah yes I don't know if I realize I
had another second brush of this but
that's really exciting to me because I
really do like this brush I would love
to have another one I'm gonna keep that
one again so I said if I have more fan
brushes I'm not going to keep them so
this is from Real Techniques so I'm
gonna pass that one on this one here is
the Sigma edge kabuki the F 87 I don't
really have a ton of use for this brush
I see some people use it to like apply
baking powder and I don't just all these
different things but I just don't really
use it so I'm gonna pass that one on
then I have this one here from Delhi am
tools this is the 960 precision blusher
I definitely wouldn't use this for blush
I don't know what I would use this or
yeah since I don't think I have a use
for it I'm gonna pass that one on okay
so this is another dull iam tools one
this is their small angled 762 I feel
like I probably have some other ones
like this in my collection that I could
keep I just don't really use these a lot
like I know people use these as like
brow brushes and such but I really don't
so I'm gonna put that in the past pile I
think that'll be okay alright this is
also from Dell um-- tools this is the
708 bent eyeliner again I just don't
really need these a lot so I'm gonna
pass that one on this is from Mac it's
the 150 brush again this one is one of
my newer ones to me I haven't used it
yet so I'm gonna keep that one
we got another fo three okay so this one
looks brand new so I might I'm gonna go
- the dyes I have three yeah three is
good so I'm gonna put that one in my
past pile
all right so we got the Sigma short
shader the e 20 yeah this is a great
brush this came in Angelica set as well
I do want to keep that one I think I
only have a few of those this is the
wide shader the e 59 honestly I don't
really reach for this one a ton I like
kind of smaller ones for my eyeshadow
shades so I'm gonna pass that one on
this one here is the cut crease ecig
situ I am going to go ahead and keep
this I think I only have one other brush
like this and I really do like them for
cut creases so and I've been doing that
more lately so I'm going to keep that
one this is the angled brow so again I'm
going to go ahead and pass that on I
don't think I've ever even used that one
and then let's see this one here is the
tapered blending 787 from Dalian tools
I'm going to go ahead and keep it it's
more it kind of reminds me that fo3 a
little bit but I don't have one from
Delhi details I'm gonna go ahead and
keep that one and then we have this one
is from Black Moon it came with the
eyeshadow palette it's kind of just like
a flat shader brush I'd say it kind of
bigger but I'll go ahead and keep that
one since it's from Black Moon and then
this is another one of the new oh this
is from Carrie actually sorry this is
the Carrie de 32 so clearly I've never
used this this came with one of their
palettes as well so I'll go ahead and
keep it so I can try it out so I can see
what I think about it so I think we're
about halfway through so let's keep
rolling so this here is the Sigma Sigma
3d HD kabuki now I used to really like
this brush before the big guy came out
and now I use that one more so I'll go
ahead and put that in the past pile this
one here is the Sigma 4 d HD kabuki
again I just don't really reach for this
one a ton so I'll go ahead and pass that
one on this year I found it I found my
vib Rouge gift from Sephora yay this is
the tiny little brush you got for
spending a thousand dollars in a
calendar year at Sephora thank you so
much Sephora I don't know if I've ever
even used this one and I've had it for
probably close to a year now but I'm
gonna go ahead and keep it because who
else really
who else garrison that I have this brush
so fine
I'll keep you alrighty so we have the
Sigma f80 7 I think I had another one of
these and I declutter
so I'll go ahead and declutter that one
as well this one here is one of the
Stella's the brushes the blender s21 too
so I'm going to keep that for my
upcoming review already here let me move
some of these clothes there okay so this
is the sigma e35 I love the e35 from
Sigma once it especially we get into the
eye brushes with Sigma I like so many of
their blending brushes so I'm gonna keep
that one let's see I know that I'm gonna
have a couple of the e25 s here so let's
just see this is e 25 okay I think it's
just these two the Sigma e25 I'll try to
see I'll try to not keep too many but
this is one of my absolute favourite
blending brushes and again this is when
it comes in handy to have multiple so I
don't have to continually be washing
them and I can just grab a fresh one so
I'm gonna keep those this one here is
from Real Techniques as the essential
crease brush I really do like this one
and it's nice and small but still a
blending brush at the same time I think
it's really good I'm going to keep that
one this is from Delhi impose its there
776 blending this reminds me exactly of
the e25 I'm gonna go ahead and keep it
this one here is from morphe it's the M
505 I don't really like this one it's
kind of scratchy on my eyelids so I'm
going to go ahead and pass that one on
this is the G 24 from morphe I really do
like this one it kind of reminds me more
of the e-40 from Sigma but I do like
that one so I'm going to keep it and
this one here is the M 4 3 3 3 4 3 3
yeah the M 4 3 3 there we go
again listen kinda reminds me the e25 as
well but I don't love it as much so I'm
gonna go ahead and pass that one on and
then this one from morphe is the M 502
again just not really a favorite so I'll
go ahead and pass that one on this one
here I don't really know who this is
from
hmm I'm not really sure but it's a
blending brush oh this might have been
one of the Tarte brushes maybe I don't
really remember now who is who this is
from but I have plenty of blending
brushes I know a lot from Sigma 2 so
I'll go ahead and pass that one on this
one here is the morphe M 504 again it
just some morphe brushes after you wash
them they kind of lose their shape and
that's kind of what this one did too so
I'm gonna go ahead and pass that on
erase so this one here is from Stella's
ax there crease brush I mean
keep it for my review this one here is
from Sigma this is the firm blender a 44
I've been loving with this brush lately
reaching for it so much so I'm going to
keep that one this is from morphe it's
the e 27 this one I'm going to keep from
morphe I really do like this one as a
blending brush and it's quite soft on
the eyelids so I'm going to hang on to
that one this one from morphe the m5 one
one I'm going to go ahead and pass that
one on not a favorite we've got another
e 25 from Sigma I'm gonna hold onto that
one and then this is the morphe m4 for
one again just kind of lost shape and
luster after handful of washes so I'm
gonna pass that one on this is another
moto brush this is the super crease
brush I think it is I use this one quite
a bit so I'm going to keep that one I
have another one here from still Laza
the crease a blender go ahead and hang
on to that one
we got another e 25 I think this is my
fourth e 25 and that's stuff like I'm
still okay with that number because I
use these almost every single day so I'm
gonna hang on to that one this one here
is from Real Techniques it's the deluxe
deluxe concealer brush I use this one
quite a bit as well
I like these for packing on like that
first shade to set my eye primer so I do
like that one that I hang on to it this
one here is from Sigma this is the e-40
so again I'm you're gonna see a lot of
40s because just one of my favorite
brushes and when I use everyday so I'm
gonna keep that one alrighty so I think
these are both gonna be 25 so now where
are we at 6
okay so I'm gonna keep these and then I
think after that will be OK for you 25
okay let's do that ok alrighty so this
one here is from morphe it's the e 17
it's just a larger pencil brush I like
to use it for more like detailed crease
work but I think I have a handful from
segments that are really similar so I'm
actually gonna go ahead and pass that
one on C like this one here this is the
small tapered blending a 45 it's really
similar to that morphe one so I'm going
to go ahead and keep that one this is
from Delia tools it's their tapered
blending 785 it reminds me of the e-40
really do enjoy it I'm gonna keep that
one okay these one here these are from
morphe and I talked about these recently
I'm like a flashback favorites video
because these had been mentioned in the
favourites for
last year but now I don't really love
them and it's just again after washing
them they just kind of got a little
scratchy on me and I just really don't
reach for these anymore so I'm gonna
declutter those three another one from
Stella's Lea here another blender brush
I'm gonna go ahead and hang on to it
this is the morphe t22 this reminds me
of that a 27 but it's a lot more firm
and I actually don't really like it on
the eyes and I don't really have another
use for it so I'm gonna pass that one on
this is another one of the tapered the
e45 so I'll keep this one if I have any
more of these though I can declutter
them I think two will be just fine this
is the Sigma this is their accentuate
highlighter f56 I don't really would
ever use this for a highlighter and I
don't have a lot of uses for it so I'll
go ahead and declutter that one okay so
I have a couple of brushes that look
like this let's see I think I see three
of them here so I just don't really use
these styles of brushes we have two from
morphe and one from Mota I know a lot of
people use these for like like
especially the smaller one I think this
came in like a nose contour set or for
like cream products but I just don't
really use those a ton so I'll go ahead
and pass those three on this one here
from morphe the m-52 - it's kind of like
a tapered highlighting brush but just
not one of my favorites and I kept you
know a handful of the f-35 so I'll pass
that one on this one from Sigma is the
buff and blend ether t-9 yeah I do like
brushes like this and they don't feel
like I've kept too many so I'll go ahead
and keep that one this one is from Kevin
a Quan and let's see this is a big old
brush I use it for foundation but I feel
like I can't remember the last time that
I used it so even though I want to keep
it I just know that I don't reach for it
a ton oh okay I'm gonna go ahead and
pass it on that's not that's not okay
this is the morphe M 0 I think this is a
this again came in the nose contour kit
but I just don't reach for it so I'll
pass that one on this one is from Tarte
it came in like there what was that
collection called like the make believe
in yourself' collection but I just don't
really reach for it much anymore and I
have other brushes I get so I'll go
ahead and pass that one on now okay so
this one is from Sigma the domed
blending a43 I
really get on a lot of use out of the
style of brush so I'll pass that on this
is another elf brush from that
beautifully precise line the 201 I like
to use these for like applying concealer
or primer on my eyelids so keep that one
the morphe m-52 9 again kind of like one
of those tapered highlight brushes don't
need another one so I'll pass that one
on this is from Alexi it's the small
angle brush again I don't need a ton
that like this don't really use them
sell put that in the past tile this one
here from ELF the small tapered brush oh
man I can remember buying this brush and
it was quite some time ago it's held up
pretty darn good this was one of my
first brushes that I used to like put
powder and stuff under my eyelids but I
feel like I've kept a couple like this
and kind of like is that small tapered
for a highlight so I'll go ahead and put
that in the past pile this one here from
morphe this came in a set so it doesn't
even have a name but I know it was
coined as like their highlighter brush
and that set I just don't really use
that type of brush to highlight a ton or
I have other favorite ones so I'll pass
that one on this one here I think this
must have been wasn't then like the
Tarte or a Real Techniques collection I
can't remember and there is no name on
it which really surprises me but I've
kept plenty like this I'll pass that one
on this one here from morphe the m45 8 I
think I bought this because I was seeing
people like stamp on their baking powder
like especially like for like the jaw
line type thing and I was like I need
that one yeah I never really use it so
go ahead of pass that went on this one
here is from bareMinerals it's the
perfecting face I actually don't really
like this brush I didn't really get the
whole like why is there a circle in the
middle of it type thing and it's kind of
like really really firm and you know
I'll go ahead and declutter that one
this one here is from Mota I kind of
want to keep this one because I don't
have a ton of others like it I've
typically declared them it's not like my
most reach for a foundation brush but I
like having that option in there so I'll
keep that one we have another bent a
liner brush this is from Sigma's b-12 I
just don't really use these again I
think this probably came in a set so
I'll pass that one on this is another
one from Kevyn Aucoin this is the
contour brush I actually I'm going to go
ahead and keep this the Kevin
kuan sculpting putter is one of my
favorites and I do like this brush so
I'll keep that one this is from morphe
it's the M at five-30 I've actually
declared this brush in the past and then
gotten another one so maybe it came in
like another morphe set or something but
I used to use this for contour a ton I
feel like it's really nice and new but
ya go I'm gonna go ahead and pass it on
I know I have others like it get it
together Samantha okay so I feel like we
got some small brushes coming up here
this is the smudge a 21 from Sigma I'm
going to keep that one and this morphe
angled brush I will declutter already
and then we have let's see are these all
the same brushes from Sigma so yeah we
have the Sigma f30 the pencil brushes I
really enjoy the pencil brushes they're
some of my favorites so I'm going to
keep these two this one here is the
inner corner the inner corner shader e46
this is a great great great brush love
it I'm going to keep that one the morphe
36 you use you see me use this in a ton
of tutorials for like my inner corner
highlight love it this is from Delhi
Amul this is their pencil brush it's a
little bit larger that like it's not
like a true pencil brush to me so I'm
gonna go ahead and put that one in the
past pile okay
so I see a brush here from Stella's ah
I'll go ahead and keep for my review we
have another one here from ELF and the
beautifully precise this is their pencil
brush I'm actually going to go ahead and
declutter it because I think I have some
more F 30s from Sigma hanging around in
there and then again another yo6
I'll go ahead and keep this one too but
if I have any other ones I will
declutter them because I think that
should be good for my collection the g28
is a nice flat definer brush from morphe
I'm going to go ahead and keep that one
we've got another kind of flat definer
here from morphe the e43
I'll go ahead and hang on to that one
those are really nice if you want like a
precise line under the lash line I think
that's really good the e20 I'll keep
another one of these I do like these as
the short shader brushes the morphe e18
this is kind of like a larger pencil
brush you know I don't use this one as
much so I'll go ahead and put that in
the past pile the end is somewhat near
this is from still aza
I'm going to keep that for my upcoming
review this
the Sigma flat definer the e15 oh I'm
gonna keep that one and honestly I'd
rather keep my Sigma over my more
because I think they're just better
qualities I'm gonna go actually head and
swap the g28 and I'll put that one in
the past pile for now the Sigma small
angled I'll go ahead and keep this one
and then let's see this is the Sigma
okay so another yo six so I'll pass that
one on because I only need a couple this
one is the morphe M 507 I do like this
for lower lash work so I'll go ahead and
keep that one this is the Sigma blending
a 36 now I think I have a couple of
these I'll just keep one because it's
not something that I use a ton it's just
I don't know it's not my absolute
favorite but I do like it so I'll just
keep this one and declutter any others
that I might have okay so we're on to
the last stack here so let's try to do
this quick so we have the Real
Techniques shading brush you quite like
these so I'm going to go ahead and keep
that one
this front here is from morphe the e 48
I'm gonna go ahead and declutter that
one and I don't feel like I need that
one okay so this is the more feet I'm
506 again I do like this for a lower
lash work I'll keep that one this is the
morphe g27 it's that similar pencil
brush but I like my other ones better
I'll get clutter that one alright so the
Sigma e55 the e55 and the e 15 before I
might have quite a few of so I'll try to
keep track of those but I'm gonna keep
that one one of my favorite flat shader
brush is this is the cullen cream
collector oh my goodness the cream color
g58 from sigma i really do like this one
especially for like really shimmery or
any sort of like crema eye products so
I'm going to keep that one this one here
is the Sigma eyeliner 11 I just don't
really use these a ton so I'll pass that
one on this one here is the Sigma
detailed lip lo4 I typically use this as
like inner corner so I'm gonna go ahead
and hang on to it
alrighty this one here is from
revolution Pro oh I think this came in a
palette but I don't really love it so
and I don't really look double unto
itself past that one on this is the
square lip from Dell Youm tools just a
brush that I wouldn't reach for a ton so
I'll put that in the past
Pyle I have a mini of the sigma e55
again I like to travel with my mini
brushes just like one of those things so
I'll keep that one this one here from
morphe again from that I brush that I
don't quite or I brush set that I don't
quite love so I'll pass that one on this
is the concealer f70 I actually use this
as a eyes shader brush and I quite like
it so I'll keep that one this one here
is from morphe this is the g20 I use
this a lot for my cut creases as well I
feel like it fits really well you can
see it's full of concealer but I'm gonna
go ahead and keep that one this is the
morphe g14 I'm gonna pass this one on
it's a little bit too fluffy for an eye
shader brush for me and my shadow can
kind of get everywhere so I'll put that
in the past pile the morphe g18 I feel
like I've kept similar ones to that so
pass that one on this is the firm shader
a 57 I just love these brushes from
Sigma and I just feel like you can't
have too many like this so I'm gonna
keep that one
I got another mini e55 clearly a
favorite I'm gonna keep that one out
might have we kept now oh boy this is
about the only morphe brush from that
set that I do enjoy because of the
pencil brush on this one is like just
really really firm and I actually do
like it so I'm gonna hang on to that one
this one from still lhasa
I'll keep I've been using it for my cut
crease work as well since I've been
doing that more another a 55 this is
from the night life collection as well
okay I'm gonna keep this one and I think
wait how many have I kept well I have
two many's but in the regular so I've
only kept two two or three I don't know
we'll just keep rolling this one here I
think this is from the SL miss glam yeah
as I'll miss glam
I just don't reach for this one a ton
though the angled eye brush I'll go
ahead and put that one in my past pile
I'm a couple here from my still aza I
guess I had more brushes than I thought
but I'm gonna keep those for my upcoming
review this is the shader a 56 from
Sigma again I like how small it is
especially if I'm doing like a halo eye
this is perfect for that so I'm gonna
hang on to that one this is a pencil e30
from Sigma I'm gonna keep this one and
then I should be good on the E 30s okay
so these ones that look pretty
from morphe and then also real
techniques I'm actually going to go
ahead and declutter both of these just
with my with my shader brushes I like
them to just be a little bit more on the
firm side not quite this fluffy so I'll
go ahead and pass those on this one here
from Stella's ah go ahead and keep I
have a couple here from Delhi impose so
we have the large shader and then also
the bold concealer I'm going to pass on
this one but I'm going to keep this one
I do like it for concealer work and it's
really nice to kind of clean up shadows
as well on the outer part of the eye and
do quite like that one okay another one
here from Stella's I'll go ahead and
keep Sigma e25 kept a couple that you 20
is now but they are nice brushes I'm
gonna keep that one and then I think we
have another e 20 okay I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter this one and then
this one here is from I want to say is
this some tart yeah this is from Tarte
but I don't reach for it a ton anymore
so I'll pass this one on I think it came
as like a free gift with an order one
time okay we got another a 55 I'm gonna
keep this one and then we're done with
the e55 yes I feel like that should be
good now okay so we have another 40 I
feel like I haven't had as many 40s as I
thought it once did but I'm gonna go
ahead and keep that one so this is the
morphe 14 kind of reminds me of the e55
so I'll if you clutter that one okay so
this is the e 50 for the medium sweeper
this is different than the e55 and I
don't know if this is what this one has
come up yet so I'm gonna hang on to that
one and I think this one is the e 54
yeah the e 50 for again guys I mean I
just used these brushes almost every
single day so it is nice to have a lot
of them I want to hear from still lhasa
and then this one here from still allows
it to so I'm going to keep those the one
that ran away this is from Sigma another
shader brush the E 56 again really nice
for those halo eyes I'll keep that one
this one here from SL mausoleum kind of
reminds me of those 55 so I'll put that
one in the past pile then we have this
one here from Mota it reminds me of the
e 54 but I've kept so many of those
although I haven't passed that one on
and then this one here is another one of
those cut crease brows
brushes I thought I had another one from
Sigma and I do really like these so I'm
going to go ahead and keep that one and
after that we are done
let me grab the brushes out we can see
how we did so that is going to do it for
my brush to clutter video so this over
here is my keep pile and I'm keeping 111
brushes oh my
and then this pile over here is my
declutter pile and I am decluttering 78
so I don't feel like that's too bad
especially I had more of those to Laza
brushes in my collection that I thought
I did and I know I want to be reviewing
the brushes there's also a couple in
there that I haven't tried yet and then
obviously you know I just had my
favorite brushes and multiples of my
favorite brushes but I feel like this is
a pretty solid declutter that's a pretty
darn good chunk of brushes to get out of
my collection so I feel like storage is
going to be a lot easier now so I hope
you enjoyed seeing a new declutter with
me if you want to see some of my other
ones I will have that listed in my
description box of course but as always
if you guys did enjoy this one I hope
that you'll give this video a thumbs up
I hope that you'll also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
