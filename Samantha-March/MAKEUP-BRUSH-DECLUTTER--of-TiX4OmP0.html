today's video is finally going to be my
makeup brush collection declutter oh my
gosh this video is obviously way overdue
we have arias here helping me scoping
out all the brushes deciding which ones
I'm gonna keep and get rid of a lot of
my videos about how I love makeup
brushes I hoard makeup brushes eye
makeup brushes are one of my weaknesses
when it comes to buying beauty related
items I don't know what it is but I love
my makeup brushes clearly but it has
become super overwhelming I've run out
of storage I mean some of these brushes
I probably haven't touched in years I
have needed to do this declutter for
such a long time I actually have more
makeup brushes but I won't even consider
putting them into my collection before I
got rid of some of these because this is
just I mean this is just this is sick
this is just crazy I don't even know
what to say I'm like embarrassed about
this but it's just it's one of my
weaknesses you guys here it is here it
is I'm gonna go through everything and
decide which brushes I'm gonna keep and
which I'm going to get rid of so I hope
that you enjoy doing a little
decluttering with me today much-needed
decluttering and uh why don't we just go
ahead and get into it I'm like I don't
even know where to begin I think I think
maybe a good place to start would be me
picking out my favorite brushes the ones
that I know for sure I don't want to get
rid of I did just post a favorite makeup
brushes video oh I'm gonna go through
and pick out all of those brushes that I
mentioned in that video because those of
course you know are my favorites I would
definitely want to keep those
so I went through everything and I tried
to grab out everything that I can
remember that I mentioned in that video
and then I also grabbed out a few
brushes that just like I know are my
favorites and that I want to stick
around so I feel like this makes me look
like I'm not doing a very good job so
far but I mean I use all these brushes
and I love them more p.m. a 4 3 9 4
foundation the Sigma 3d HD kabuki for
foundation again I the Sigma f80 one of
my favorite foundation brushes I do have
a couple of them so actually I'm gonna
declutter this one because it's really
old like I've had this one for probably
four years and I did just get a new one
from Sigma so I am gonna go ahead
actually and no I'm gonna put that in my
declutter pile it really does just need
to be thrown away it is super old I've
also been loving the Sigma curved kabuki
eff a t-34 foundation for concealer this
is another new Sigma brush it is the 4 d
HD kabuki I've been loving this for
concealer a lot of these brushes are
super dirty because I used them so very
often but this is one of the new Sigma
dimensional brushes another one from
Sigma the edge kabuki eff 87 that is
from their new dimensional line as well
and I've been loving it for cream
contour this is the Sigma 3d HD max
kabuki and it's one of my absolute
favorite foundation brushes right now I
have not used a beauty sponge and like
over a week because I keep using this
particular brush for foundation so I
know those are all staying this is one
from Mota brushes in their prismatic
line I use this for foundation and I
really do like it so a couple other face
brushes so I do use this I mean I'm from
Sigma all at the time the Sephora 57 is
my favorite concealer brush like ever
elf it's favorite for contour I love the
Sigma f30 for bronzer and the Sigma f40
for blush love the morphe r24 bronzer
the Sigma fo6 for contour is fantastic
so all of these are going to stay so I
pulled out the lux a 522 tapered brush I
actually have two of these but one must
still be in the other pile so I will
have to find that because I will
definitely be keeping these I don't mind
having
or triples of brushes that I love
because it helps not having to wash them
so often when you have backups the
morphe III i love for powder the morphe
for I love for blush I think that is
most of my face brushes here the Real
Techniques expert concealer brush a lot
of times I use this to set to like my
eyelid primer or even underneath my eyes
the Sigma fo3 is my favorites
highlighting brush at the moment so
those those are most of my favorites
face brushes so I'll be keeping all of
those the rest of these are eye brushes
and I do have multiples of like the
Sigma e-40 the Sigma e25 I will be
keeping all of them really none of them
are in bad enough shape that I'm like oh
I should probably get rid of them so I'm
gonna keep all of them the e55 in a 54
from Sigma I use those all the time for
lid shades of the e 45 I know I have a
couple of these but I use them really
often the cut crease a 62 I use this for
a cut crease or to put primer on my lids
i talked about the morphe copper dream
set and my favorite brushes video too
they have some really good eye brushes
that I enjoy quite a few brushes from
the morphe gunmetal lines that I really
enjoy as well for blending for crease
works for eyelid work here's another
East forty I do really enjoy the Real
Techniques what is this one called this
is the essential crease brush it's great
for blending here's another 55 again
none of these are in bad enough shape
like my Sigma f80 that I think that I
should probably get rid of so I'm going
to keep all of these the morphe 18 and a
36 or some of my favorite detailed
brushes and then here is another key 45
again I know it might seem weird to keep
brushes that I have like 3 in flora and
not declutter one or two but I prefer it
that way because I use these brushes so
much it just helps me not to have to
clean them repeatedly on a daily basis
and I can kind of rotate them to kind of
help them last a little bit longer so
these are all of my eye brushes that are
some of my favorites that I'm going to
be keeping so so far I mean I'm just
going by my favorites but these I'm
keeping and uh baby decluttering
off to a solid start good good stuff
good stuff Sam I thought I could start
breaking it down maybe into like little
collections once we got like favorites
out of the way so this collection right
here actually both of these are both
from my makeup brush set they have sent
me to different collections now this
first one was like a unicorn set so
honestly a lot of these brushes I
haven't really used because the quality
wasn't quite there
I do love my Sigma morphe brushes I love
Real Techniques those are the brushes
that you see kind of like the most of my
collection because I feel like the
quality is there and a lot of these the
quality just is not like they're just
kind of a little bit more flimsy oh
honestly I mean there's a mixture of
face brushes and eye brushes and I think
that I can just go ahead and declutter
all of them I mean I obviously have you
know all of these brushes elsewhere in
my collection but because I just didn't
love the quality on these I'm I'm gonna
go ahead and declutter them let's know
what how many brushes I have I know that
I don't need to keep this collection
around so I'm going to go ahead and pass
that on and then the first set actually
that they sent to me were these kind of
like oval brushes these were super
trendy at one point on Instagram I have
used as a foundation brushes I think I
used these both as foundation brushes
and I did like them but you'll see I
have more in my collection and I kept
one that looked just like this from the
Mona brushes so I don't need like
multiples of these types of brushes
because I don't reach for them a ton so
I know that I could declutter them you
know some of these I've used for like
concealer and contour but again I have
some other brushes like that and I just
don't reach for these kind of oval
brushes as much as I do my regular
brushes and then these are kind of like
the smaller detailed brushes I just got
some brushes kind of similar to this
from morphe brushes and our nose contour
set but really I really don't reach for
these a whole lot anyways this one I
remember I used it as like a lip brush
one time and I think it's pretty much
stayed really badly so that will
probably just have to be thrown away but
I'm gonna go ahead and say that I can
declutter these as well I just reach for
other brushes on a more consistent basis
so I think these are just kind of
cluttering up things so I'm going to
declutter this collection as well
collection is the rest of the
Copper dreams set from morphe brushes so
I will say that I really disliked both
of these brushes I thought they were
very Scratchy like uncomfortable on my
face so I would definitely get rid of
those and then these are some I brush
--is uh oh I mean I'm gonna keep this
one because I know that I have used it
and this one is more of a liner brush
and I can go through this quite a bit
too so I will go ahead and hang on to
those and then these are the other three
that are left so this one is kind of
like a duo fiber brush I know I have
more of these in my collection I don't
think I have one that is this small
though so I'm going to keep it just
because I don't have a lot of other ones
like that and then these two I think I
can get rid of both of these as well I
haven't really reached for them a whole
lot and I think I have others that are
similar in the collection and I thought
the eye brushes from this collection
we're definitely the state does the face
brushes didn't quite impressed me that
much so I'll go ahead and pass these on
to so I'm getting rid of four from that
collection and I'm keeping three these
are the other brushes that came in the
mode of prismatic said I already kept
the foundation ones on I know that I can
pass on it looks kind of just like one
from the my makeup brush set but I don't
use this at all I'm really not even sure
what the best purpose is for that one so
I can go ahead and pass that one and on
and then these two I think I only need
to keep one so I'm going to keep this
one because I feel like I use it for
concealer a little bit more than this
bigger one
speaking of motor brushes they just sent
me this collection this is part of their
metallic line and I have been really
loving both of these brushes right here
one is a buffer brush and then one is a
this is for contour I've really been
enjoying these so I'm definitely going
to keep them one is a duo fiber stipple
brush I know I just kept one and I know
I have more in my collection so I'm
going to go ahead and pass this one on
this one is a pointed foundation brush I
just don't really reach for this a lot
I'm not someone who puts foundation on a
brush and then swipes it onto my face I
typically just put it right onto
whatever brush or Beauty Blender that
I'm using to blend it out so this one I
don't think I need to keep around and
then these are some of their eye brushes
I think I'm
to keep these two because they look more
like what I'd get a use out of and then
that way I can review some from the
metallic line and then these two just
are kind of shaped that I don't reach
for a ton so they call it the pointed
liner and then also the brow brush I
mean I don't I use pencils for my brows
I wouldn't really use this one and I
like more traditional pencil brushes
versus this kind of like weird thin one
so I'm gonna go ahead and pass along
these four and I will keep these four
from my most recent motor brushes hall
this is a collection from Tarte
cosmetics that was the make believe in
yourself' brushes so this brush I do
reach for quite a bit I use it for blush
pretty often so I would go ahead and
keep that one this brush I felt like I
never got a handle of what I was
supposed to be doing with it I didn't
reach for it a ton I tried it a couple
times for contour I think I've tried it
once for like foundation but I'm gonna
declutter that one because I just don't
reach for it a ton this one I think I
can go ahead and declutter this one - I
have other brushes that are very similar
to this that I reach for it a little bit
more and then these two brushes I don't
know like the Tarte the make believe in
yourself' collection didn't Wow me like
I know a lot of people were really
impressed with it but it didn't allow me
as much as I thought it would but this
is an okay blending brush and blending
brushes are always so dirty for me that
I'm gonna go ahead and keep it and this
is more of a flat shader and you know
obviously you can tell that I've used it
and my flat shader brush is get pretty
dirty often as well so I'm gonna keep
these three from the Tarte and then pass
along these two this is a set that was
recently sent to me from FL miss glam
actually do have a brush book from her
as well that I will show a little bit
later that she sent to me and then she
also sent along this six piece I think
it was called the unicorn set so I liked
it because they're all kind of like mini
brushes but obviously the handles are
super beautiful I'm gonna go ahead and
keep the blending brush first sure
because like I said I just really
enjoyed the blending brushes I really
have been liking this brush as well I've
been reaching for it for highlight and
for all so I'm setting like under-eye
powder so I know that I want to keep
that one so with these four
they're kind of like barely used I feel
like I could clean them pretty good and
then pass them along to someone just
because I have other brushes that are
super still learn to they just don't
reach for these as often as I do some of
the other ones and I'm trying my best to
be as ruthless as I can here which is
really hard so I'm gonna keep these two
and then pass along these four you want
to check in for how we're doing so far
these are all that I am keeping and then
those are what I am passing on obviously
the keeping piles a little bit picker at
this time but we still have that pile to
go so I think we're getting somewhere
okay so I have the rest of the
collections broken down but first I did
want to show you this is the teal glam
brush book from SL miss glam beauty and
inside is just a ton of different
brushes this was recently sent to me and
I have been going through and using
quite a bit of the brushes and you know
testing them all out but so far I've
really been liking this I love how it's
a brush book and it has its own
organization so far there's nothing
inside that I would want to declutter
I'm still trying a lot of the brushes
but I will say I feel like the brushes
in this in this brush book are better
quality than what I tried in that
separate unicorn set that I showed
earlier I've been very impressed with a
lot of these brushes I mentioned I think
two of them in my most recent makeup
monthly video and I mentioned them in my
favorites they are just really like
quality brushes that are in here so I'm
going to keep everything inside this
right now I've been continuing to try it
out but yeah I was very impressed with
the teal glam
brush book from SL miss glam these are
the rest of my Real Techniques brushes
so this one is a blush brush and I
always kind of use this as to kind of
blend everything together versus a blush
brush but I have a couple different
brushes now that I use for that and this
brush is really really old I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter that one this one is
a face brush it's called the expert face
brush and this is what I use if I'm
using like powder and I just kind of
want to stamp powder onto my face this
is what I use I'd reach for that one
more so I'm going to go ahead and keep
that one this is a lash separator it
came in a set and I don't think I've
ever used it so I'm going to go ahead
and be cool
that one then we have a couple of eye
brushes here I do is use this one quite
a bit but I would keep this one I'll
keep this one too because I do use it
quite a bit as a regular shadow brush
and then this little tiny brush I really
don't reach for a ton I don't have a lot
of uses for it so I'm gonna declutter
three from Real Techniques and then also
keep three so these are some other
brushes that I have from luck see beauty
one is this duo fiber powder brush again
I have a couple of duo fibers and this
one wasn't my favorite so I'm going to
declutter that one this is a blush brush
I really do like this one I thought it
was good quality I am gonna keep this
one this one is a liner brush I'm gonna
go ahead and keep this one too because I
do like it I feel like I would get the
most uses out of this
so declaring one keeping two okay this
is what I have left for some morphe
brushes I was just recently sent this
set right here this is what a
collaboration with Brittany bear it was
like a nose contour set I haven't been
able to try it out yet so I do want to
keep it because I wanted to be able to
give my thoughts on it so I am going to
keep those three this one is the e49
I've been using this a lot lately to set
powder on my under eyes so I do want to
keep that one this one is the m5 3-0 I
don't know if you can tell but the
bristles are kind of everywhere I think
this is probably like the brush that I
have the worst experience with with the
morphe it was one of my favorites at
first you use for contour or bronzer but
I just fell apart way too quickly so I'm
gonna go ahead and declutter that one
again this is the Emma 501 and I don't
know if you can tell it used to be a
really nice tulip shape and now it's
kind of a hot mess I use it for
highlight and I really did like it but
now it's just I mean it's just falling
apart so I'm going to declutter that one
this is the g2 it's very comparable to I
think it's the F 79 from Sigma or under
eye concealer and I do use it quite a
bit so I'm going to keep that one this
one I think this actually oh sorry I
made a mistake this one is the Sigma
brush this one is the new morphe one
from Brittany bear so super similar so
I'm going to put this launch back in my
Sigma pile but I'm going to keep this
one because I haven't been able to try
it out yet this is my M 4 to 7 this is a
nice duo fiber brush I do want to keep
this one I've decluttered a couple of
the other dual fiber so I'm going to
hold on to that one then we have some
eye brushes here and I know that I'm
to keep all of them the g13 I use as a
flat shader I do the same with the g14
this one is a nice pencil brush that
I've been using for the lower lash line
this is the M 506 this is a really nice
like straight flat liner g28
and then this one is the g27 again also
a nice pencil brush so I'm keeping all
of those oh you know of course I do like
my morphe brushes I'm just declutter in
the two that are in really bad shape and
then keeping the rest of these I also
have a pretty large pile of the rest of
my Sigma brushes and I feel like this
one is going to be a hard one this is a
new brush to me this is the s 84 it is
the angled kabuki I just got it so I do
want to keep that one this one is the s
89 you know I feels like I don't use
this brush a whole ton it's the baked
kabuki I'm gonna declare this one
because I don't reach for it a ton this
is a nice fan brush this is the f40 too
I like it because it's a little bit
smaller than normal fan brushes and I do
reach for this for highlighting so I'm
going to keep that one this one is a
dual fibre a blending brush it's the
e-40 one I do not use this a time--as so
I'll put that in the past pile this is
the large fluff that you 50 I mean you
just saw that I have that one from
morphe so actually I'm going to go ahead
and pass this one on because I don't see
myself reaching for this type of brush a
lot anyways and if I have the one from
morphe that will be okay this is the
tapered face f25 I do like this brush
for dusting away powder and things like
that so I do want to keep this one I do
really enjoy that one this one is the
angled cream contour the f6e one I'm
going to keep that one because I do
reach for it for when I'm applying cream
contour this one is the p89 I use this a
ton at to set powder under my eyes so I
do want to keep this one I do reach for
it quite a bit this one is the spot
light duster the F 37 I actually don't
really like this brush it's for
highlighting I believe and I just didn't
think it was super great so I'm gonna
put that in the packs pile this one is
the e30 I love this pencil brush I
thought I have another one but I don't
see it but I am gonna keep my e30 this
one is the lash fan it's the EO Thor I
really don't reach for this
so I will pass that one over the lo4 the
detailed lip I actually use this for
eyeliner quite a bit so I'm going to
keep that one this one is the it's the
essential highlight it's the f56 but I
have used it for like powder so I am
gonna keep that one I do have two of the
e65 so I have been keeping quite a bit
of my liner brushes so I'm actually
gonna pass one along and keep one just
because I know that I've been keeping a
lot of liner brushes this is the eo6
winged liner it's one of my absolute
favourite winged liner brushes so I do
want to keep that one I do have two of
the e39 and I feel like I can get rid of
one so I'm gonna go ahead and put one in
the past pile and keep one because I
feel like I only need one of those and
then I have the e30 7 and then also the
e 54 they do look pretty similar I'm
gonna go ahead and keep the e 43 and
pass along the e 37 this is the lo6
precise lip liner I really don't use it
really for anything so I'm gonna pass
that one along and then also this bent
liner the b12 I'm gonna keep it because
I don't have anything like this that's
like really why I'm gonna keep it but I
have reach for it just a couple of times
but this is the small eyeliner e 10 I'm
gonna go ahead and pass that one over
and then this one is a blending brush
the e36 I like it it has a little bit of
a unique shape so I'm gonna go ahead and
keep that one
so I think I did okay what's my Sigma
brushes so I'm gonna go ahead and keep
feeds and then pass along B and then the
last section I have this is just kind of
like randoms I didn't belong in any sort
of collection this is a brush from Kevin
naquan I believe it is their foundation
brush I definitely do want to keep this
it's super sturdy like this is just a
really nice foundation brush so I do
want to keep it well the what sent to me
from Kevin a Quan which I just think is
awesome is another one from Kevin of
Quan this is a contour brush I do want
to keep this one as well you can just
tell it these are like very nice quality
brushes so I will keep that one this one
is from ELF it's a flawless concealer
brush it's one of the first brushes that
I ever bought but I really don't reach
for it too much so I'm going to go ahead
and pass that one along the elf brush
it's the 204 again I just don't like
these really tiny
minor brushes if you can see that one
okay like it's just too small I just
don't reach for it a lot so I'm gonna
pass that one along this is a brush from
lorac it came in one of the palettes I
don't really remember which one but I
just don't really reach for it so
passing that one along this one is from
Tarte cosmetics I got it as like what a
point perk from the Tarte rewards
program I do like it for like cream or
foiled eyeshadows so I'm going to keep
that one this is a brush it says
revolution Pro I'm assuming I came in
one of my eyeshadow palettes but I'm
just gonna go ahead and pass that along
this is another one from Kevin of Quan
this is their little concealer brush
really I don't use this one a ton I've
tried it out a couple of times but I
think I can actually even though it's
really good quality I can go ahead and
pass it along this one is another one
from ELF you can tell that I use this
one quite a bit for like eyelid primer
so I'm gonna keep that one and then this
one is from BH Cosmetics this was like
one of my very first blending brushes
ever this one has like a lot of
nostalgia to it but I just have you know
some better quality blending brushes now
so I'll pass that one over this one is
from ELF
I do love my pencil brushes of course so
I do want to keep this one
and this is the elf small tapered again
this is one of my like nostalgia brushes
to me one of my first ones that I got
when I learned that you should set your
concealer on your under eyes and that's
what I use this one for so I am going to
keep that one I did find two more from
the my makeup brush that I didn't reach
out prior but I'm just going to go ahead
and pass both of those along this one is
a brush from pixie Beauty it came with
the the Merriam NYC collaboration and
it's a really really good brush I enjoy
both sides of it so I do want to keep
that one
we got another pencil brush from ELF
maybe I've kept so many pencil brushes I
probably I'm gonna pass one along and
keep one I know I've kept a lot of
pencil brushes so there's that and then
this last one is from Pierre it's their
foundation brush that they came out with
when they released a new foundation
again I'm just not a huge fan of these
types of brushes and this one was almost
like too big for my face I felt like I
couldn't get into like specific areas
for my foundation because it was just a
little bit too big so I'm gonna go ahead
and pass
that on so for kind of like my random
brushes I'm keeping these and then
passing these on as my brush declutter
has finished so on this side we have all
of the brushes that I will be keeping
and on this side we have all the brushes
that I decluttered I know I definitely
kept more brushes than I declutter but
at least it's a start
right figured this one would be a tough
one to do because of my extreme love for
makeup brushes for clearing out quite a
few makeup brushes and I'm happy with it
I I do wish I could have done a little
bit more over here but I for right now I
am happy with what I did know some of
the brushes that I saved that even
though I have multiples of it so I don't
have to continually clean them and then
some of them that I decided to keep to
are like more affordable options for
brushes that I like that are more
expensive so at least I have some
fordable options when I am doing like
tutorials and things like that so yeah
