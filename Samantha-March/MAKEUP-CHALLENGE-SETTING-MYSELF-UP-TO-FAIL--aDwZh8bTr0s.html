today's video is going to be a little
bit of a makeup challenge and one that
I'm pretty unsure about not really sure
what I'm going to title this video yet
but basically I'm going to be trying out
products that I do not think will work
for me I don't think will look good on
me or I'm just really not sure how to
use so sometimes I get makeup products
that maybe are not in my correct shade
or products that intimidate me I don't
think I'm going to be able to expertly
apply them but I still want to try them
out I'm not really a fan of the makeup
challenges that float around a lot that
are just kind of like very silly and
light-hearted I'm a fan of watching them
I'm not a fan of doing them myself this
isn't supposed to be like a silly
challenge I genuinely want to try these
products I just don't think they're
gonna work out the best for me so let me
explain what we have here today this one
here is from pure cosmetics they sent me
their four in one stick foundation and
they even put my name on it which is
super cute but they sent me the shade
porcelain and I don't think this is
gonna be a great shape for me this is
their lightest lightest a shade and the
foundations and I don't think I've ever
worn the shade porcelain and especially
now I've been outside a lot so I don't
think person's gonna work great but I
still want to try the foundation and see
what I think of it I just don't think
it's gonna be a great shape match I also
have here I've wanted to try this for
the longest time but it intimidates me
it's from NARS it is their Hot Tin Roof
a liquid blush I don't really work with
liquid blushes a lot this color is a
little bit scary to me I'm not sure how
we're gonna do but that's what today's
videos for we're gonna try it I also
have a very interesting eyeliner here
this is from Revlon this is the color
stay exact if I liquid liner this is
what she looks like and when I got it
outside okay cool and then I took the
applicator out and I'm like what in the
what can you see there's like a ball on
it and the rete and the description says
it's like
a wheel that will rotate and I'm like
but okay so we're gonna give that a shot
as well and then we have a brow product
this is from flower Beauty this is their
brow vixen tattoo effect stain and I'm
Tara this is the color that when I'm
most terrified about because I'm not a
brow expert anyways but this kind of
scares me here's what the applicator
looks like apparently it's gonna be like
a tattoo for your brows this is very
scary if it doesn't work out well but I
thought we could give all of this a try
I am someone who uploads six to seven
days a week which means I'm filming
almost every single day which means I
don't have a lot of time to try out
products that I don't feel are gonna
work for me because I just don't have
time for that I need to be filming and
editing and uploading so I thought now
that I have a handful of products here
maybe we could make it into a video we
can see how I do we can test out some
products that intimidate me but I don't
think we'll look great on me that I'm
not really sure how to use so this could
be terrible this could be fun I really
don't know well let's get started so the
only thing that I have on my face right
now is just a little bit of eye shadow
and then some mascara but I am gonna
start off with the foundation I'm very
nervous about this but so I guess that
this is from pure it's there for in one
stick foundation I've wanted to try this
foundation it's fairly newer I've wanted
to try it and I was really excited and
surprised when Pierce sent me a really
nice package and had this in it and it
has my name on it which is super cute
with that heart and I was like yay and
then I looked at this shade and it said
porcelain and this isn't the lightest
lightest shade there was a light
porcelain and then porcelain I believe I
checked the website so I was like this
shade is definitely not gonna work for
me and like I said it because I film
soft and I don't really have time like I
don't mind if my foundation is like a
shade or two off but like I think we're
gonna be more than a shade or two off
but you know I still want to give it a
try I still want to see so I do have my
primer on as well so I'm just gonna go
ahead
I'm just gonna okay it feels very
interesting going on because it feels
like a cream to powder I was looking on
the website and I saw that it said that
it's supposed to be it's a medium to
full buildable coverage foundation okay
it's a $34 I'm gonna go ahead and use
the sponge here this is from Sigma's
sister brand I'm not sure the best way
to pronounce it but I'll have that link
down below
I actually really like these sponges and
I like them way more than the new Sigma
sponges that I just reviewed in my
makeup monthly these are actually pretty
nice so I'm just gonna go ahead and
blend that in and see how we do the
challenge isn't meant to be like you
know super super silly I just don't
really want to try these products I'm
just either scared of them I don't think
that they're gonna look the best on me
but I still want to give them a shot and
see what I think okay this is going well
this is going well should I be like am i
you're just gonna go ahead and blend on
to the neck a little bit I'm not gonna
be too concerned though because clearly
like even if I sell them another video
after this I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead
and remove the makeup but it seems to be
blending out well the coverage does look
fairly nice I'm not gonna be able to
take myself seriously with this entire
video the coverage just seemed to be
nice I do have some breakouts but
especially under my chin it covered a
lot of that redness this red mark here
is just really not going anywhere what's
like anything so I will say though I
don't really like how it's a look in
here on my forehead I don't I'm not in
like my super super dry moments right
now like dry patchy skin but that like I
don't feel like that looks super great
and even a little bit on my nose I don't
think that's coming off super flattering
as well shoot shoot shoot I really do
like peer I've been buying from peer for
a very long time but I have noticed
there
foundations don't tend to work for me
the best I really like their powder the
foreign one pressed powder but they're
like bear Adolphe foundation really did
not work well for me okay
so here's what the foundation looks like
again if we just disregard the color
just let's just go ahead and disregard
what's happening there I feel like the
cover just fairly good I didn't put on a
timer for a stick foundation I've
noticed a lot of times with stick
foundations you really have to like
cover your whole face with it but so
this would be more like on the medium
side I would say like yeah that's like a
pretty solid medium so I don't hate that
coverage I think it did a fairly good
job covering up some of the marks that I
have on my face but it's not like
fullfil and I feel like I can still
breathe like it doesn't feel too heavy
on my skin either which I enjoy don't
love the way it's showing on my forehead
like it looks great like my forehead
looks very scaly and I don't love that
and then same with my nose I'm not
really I'm not really feeling that vibe
either so mmm I'm not sure this one is
gonna be considered a win so that's a
bummer you know it's kind of hard to
review a product that is obviously like
so not well matched for you I don't know
if I'll really be able to test it out a
ton more because I'm always so busy with
filming but just kind of based on first
impressions I don't think it's gonna be
a favorite so I'm not really gonna worry
about like concealer and bronzer and and
all of that because of the nature of
this makeup challenge that we're doing
so I'm gonna pop right over and try this
blush here from NARS and then when you
pop the cap off here you have a little
pump so I feel like I've seen people
apply liquids like directly to the face
with their sponge and then blend it out
so that's what I'm gonna try to do I
really hope this doesn't ruin my sponge
because I really like this sponge but
let's just give it a try so I'm gonna
try to go light at first that's not like
too much I don't know I don't know I
just don't really use liquid blushes a
lot they they definitely intimidate me
especially even more than cream
okay so that looks like I have
chickenpox now especially on my super
pale mime skin I feel like that's not
where I wanted to put either blush spot
though and I still have more on there so
I'm gonna use like the side maybe and
blend it out oh my gosh this is like mmm
okay okay okay okay this is not going
well at all this is going this is
business going worse than I expected
somehow in my mind I was like maybe you
can pull everything off like when I was
thinking about the foundation being too
light for me oh my goodness when I was
thinking about the foundation being too
light for me I was like maybe you can
show people like if you have this
contour or this bronzer like you can
make it work and then like as I put the
first stripe on I was like delete that
delete you're like that's not what this
is going to be just go with the
challenge okay so that clearly is way
too much blush and I didn't even use all
that I put on there so this is going
splendidly just as I anticipated oh do
you guys use liquid blushes do you use
liquid washes because um yeah so I have
always wanted to try that at Nora's
blush because I thought it was very
interesting and I like the color but I
was always very afraid because I'm like
well what if I put down my primer in my
foundation and my concealer and my
powder my contour my bronzer and then I
come up with the blush and I ruined the
look luckily that's that's what's uh
that's not what's happening here today
I'm still looking very beautiful so
that's a positive if you guys would like
to see more Challenge videos like this
for me in the future please do just just
uh let me know because I would be happy
to to do this again
I'm having a wonderful time doing this
right now I also noticed I've been
trying to blend out and you see it's
like very strange because like that's my
skin so I don't I'm gonna go ahead and
say liquid blushes are
not for me so let's move on to eyeliner
because this I think is gonna go
swimmingly okay so again we have the
Revlon Colorstay
exact fi liquid liner I'm very
intimidated by this I don't understand
it it says the wheel is supposed to like
rotate as you're as you're putting it on
your light which I don't like why I've
never put a liquid eyeliner on and I'm
like this would be a lot better if there
is a wheel I'm good enough so you guys
can catch this full glory but is about
to happen okay so I'm just gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna start I usually
start in the middle so that's I'm gonna
do I'm gonna start in the middle okay so
with that was not what I expected
let's try again okay so mister in the
middle is they're not product on this
what's happening is this snot am I doing
this wrong already dip it back in there
make sure we got enough product on the
wheel okay let's try again so I'm gonna
start in the middle and okay I don't
think that looks terrible no I don't
think no it's terrible let me get right
up in there okay okay that is good no it
was good no we just do like a little
okay is this the best liner I've ever
done in my life I just kind of like
goofed up right here but honestly that
wasn't that bad but I'm not gonna lie I
didn't notice anything rotating or I
don't know I didn't really notice
anything like that so maybe it's not as
bad as I thought I mean the first couple
of tries were a little weird but
honestly like I don't like that's bad
and when I flicked it out like that's
actually a pretty good flick I feel like
I can see what
do it can you see the wheel like rotate
it's like a tire that's very interesting
okay let's try the other right let's try
the other right and this movie isn't
that bad well that's okay before I get
too carried away let's try again okay so
mr. in the middle oh my god I actually
like I don't freaking hate this it's
fill everything in okay all right and
then let's do the flick that okay okay
the flick is so much easier to do when
you have that I don't know if it's cuz
it's so skinny I can you see how skinny
that is it's that was actually really
easy to that is not what I expected okay
let's see if we can like do something
here like connected or something okay I
messed up a little bit but I mean how
first drive not that bad you guys
honestly I would totally use this again
I would use this again to get that flick
I know it's not perfect I know I know
that but I feel like I could get used to
it I don't love it for like lining my
eyes it's I don't know I mean maybe if I
got used to it I would but like I would
totally use something to line my eyes
and then come in and just create like a
nice little flick cuz it's so easy with
the wheel poom
I actually don't I actually don't hate
it
I know the application is a little funky
but I actually don't hear this product
and see I probably would have never have
used this if I wasn't doing this kind of
like style of challenge video I it's
it's been sitting on my desk of things
to try for months like probably two
months well who would've thought not me
so then the last product we're gonna try
is this brow pencil and I'm super
nervous about it because I definitely
have like my comfort zone when it comes
to brows and it's just like a regular
old brow pencil and this is more of like
a pen I think
so it's called the brow vixen tattoo
effect stain now I do have the shade
blonde I meant to grab out taupe and
then I think I already put taupe into a
giveaway box so I didn't want to like
pull it out because I thought I was
weird so I don't know if blonde will be
the best match typically if a brand has
taupe that's what I go with but I don't
before see this going well so but you
know what people will be surprised
because mmm that eyeliner surprised me
so again here is what she looks like and
let me do like some strokes here so we
can see oh gosh so it feels like a
marker it kind of has a bit of mixed
reviews on alta like some people are
like this is the best and I had a really
bushy brow and some people are like this
is horrible don't do it one person said
when she tried to set her brows it
turned her brows color her brows a color
like purple or something and I'm like I
don't usually set my brows anyway so I'm
not gonna worry about that but I'm gonna
go in and I'm afraid when it says it's a
tattoo like it's a stain because I'm
gonna have to wash this makeup off so I
can actually fill my next video
okay you know that the color isn't great
but let's I mean obviously my foundation
matches really well so that's not what
we're worried about right now it feels
like a wet marker okay feels like a wet
sharpie gosh that color is so off and
sometimes with certain brow pencils I
use blonde so this is like I'm surprised
that it's this far off do a couple
strokes in the front here how do people
get this to look like hair so I feel
like it's definitely doing something I
feel like maybe if the color match is a
little bit better it wouldn't be as
noticeably incorrect
but I also I don't feel like it's a very
natural looking like I like how you can
do hair stroke so I'm like slowly and
slowly getting better at it but this to
me just doesn't look very natural it
looks like I literally put a marker
my brows to try to cover up the sparse
areas and it's weird to me how wet it
feels and there's no you know you don't
have like a spleen or anything so or do
a mic or do you know I think that's
nothing you don't have a spoolie which I
guess you would only use that with like
a pencil or pomade Bristol I just feel
like it doesn't look natural
again like ignore the color but the
actual I just don't feel like it looks
very natural I feel like it looks like I
drew in my brows with a marker what do
you guys think have you tried this wow
this video I mean I don't know why I
honestly had the thought of look you can
do it you can pull it together that's
not even close to happening so I went
ahead and filled in the other brow like
I really tried to make those hair
strokes in the front and I don't know I
just I just don't feel like it's a I
just don't feel like it's a very natural
looking brow as its drying I actually
think it's looking better I also I think
it's weird I don't know if it's like for
at the foundation but I feel like it
looks like I have like black eyes is
that what how did that has up in there
the whole time and I just think didn't
notice or is it because my foundation is
so white it just is weird hmm I don't
know I'll have to wash that back and see
what that was all about but other than
that that's going to do it for this
video I guess oh that is going to be it
for today's makeup challenge thank
goodness so this challenge was all about
trying products that I didn't think
would work out for me or that I wasn't
sure how exactly to apply them and I
feel like that is very evident by what
my face looks like at the moment I hope
that you guys enjoyed this video I hope
you got a laugh or 10 let me know what
you thought in the comments this one way
more wrong than I thought it was going
to look I thought it was gonna go wrong
but it really went way more wrong than I
thought it was so I hope that you had a
good
let me know if you'd like to see more
like this in the future because every
once in a while I get products that I'm
like that's probably not gonna work for
me but hey we could try it out together
and have a good time other than that
guys that's gonna do it for today's
video if you did enjoy it I hope that
you'll give it a thumbs up I hope that
you'll also consider subscribing before
you go and I'll catch you guys in
tomorrow's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
