today's video is going to be a new
makeup declutter I have everything in
this bag here that I am going to be
saying goodbye to it is that time I
really needed to do a declutter and I'm
going to show you everything today that
I decided to purge from my collection
I'm also going to talk a little bit
about an upcoming blog sale that I'm
going to be doing for some of these
items that you will see in the declutter
where my blog sale will be kind of how
it runs and things like that so if you
are interested in seeing a new makeup
collection declutter then why don't we
go ahead and get started
like I said I have everything in this
bag here so what I'm gonna do is just
pull out each of the products and
explain kind of why I am getting rid of
it what I did for this to clutter it was
about one month ago maybe five weeks ago
I got really frustrated I was looking
around my office which is filled in
every single corner there's a gun
looking crazy it's seeming to be full of
makeup I've been trying so hard to get
some sort of organization in here and I
just felt really overwhelmed and I
thought you need to do something I
talked about last week in my in my
latest Villa by a video a little bit
about consumerism and just the incessant
needing and wanting of buying makeup and
and how it got a little bit out of
control and how I definitely fell into
that and again it was about a month ago
that I just got really fed up with my
collection so I went through I tried to
grab out items that you know I just
don't like anymore I don't use maybe
that are really old I'm such a hoarder
like I hold onto things if they have a
special memory to me if they were like
my first of something our first from a
brand things like that like I just I
hold on to did not just make up at
anything and I was like no like just you
need to get rid of some of your makeup
and I said just do that put everything
into this bag and then if you pull
something out if you think oh no where
is that and you pull it out of this bag
you can put it back in your collection
if you don't pull it out of this bag
it's gonna stay in the bag and then
you're going to do a declutter I pulled
one item out of this bag one
and I pulled it out only to feature it
in my video about my least favorite
products from my favorite brands so
everything in here then I put in a month
ago is being declared if you are trying
to do a declutter whether it's with your
makeup whether it's with your clothes
whether it's with anything I kind of
suggest this this was the first time I
really did something like this take the
things that you don't think you use a
lot or that you don't wear a lot or you
don't reach for a lot put them away if
you reach for them in a month's time
then they can go back in your collection
if they don't then you got to get rid of
them so I'm just gonna go through and
pull out everything in here and that I
have so let's save first up I see a pair
of eyelashes so these were the eye lure
in Vegas net grand glamour lashes these
are just really old they just needed to
be tossed so I will be getting rid of
those so next up I have a couple items
here from pixie beauty I have the it's
duty time eyes shadow palette and also
the it's duty time lip palette these
were sent to me and PR and they just did
not work out for me I did not enjoy
these the lip palette especially I
featured this one in my least favorite
products from my favorite brands and I
just did not enjoy this one and the
eyeshadow palette just really didn't do
anything for me which was sad because
looking at it I would think that this
would be an eyeshadow palette that I'd
really enjoy but I just did not so I
will be declaring both of those
eyeshadow palettes the next thing that I
see here is from Benefit Cosmetics this
is a little book called the bronze of
Champions I bought this many many years
ago and it really does just need to be
thrown out I did get a lot of use out of
it this was when I was first getting
into makeup I think before I even had a
channel and I would hear a lot of people
talking about the hoola bronzer and how
fantastic it was and this did come with
the hoola bronzer and I put quite a dent
into this hoola bronzer I did get quite
a bit of use out of it it came with a
cream eyeshadow and a powder eyeshadow I
used those a ton that was like that is
the entire summer after I bought this
that is what I used I used the little
bronzer I really enjoyed the Watts up
highlighter came with the they're real
mascara I used that up it also came with
a lipgloss that's the only thing I
didn't use out of this but it is very
old and I really just don't reach for it
a ton anymore it was kind of hard as
now that I have a bigger collection it's
harder to reach for like a box I don't
know if that makes sense but just wasn't
reaching for a lot and it is a fairly
older so I will be getting rid of that
as well I have another item here from
pixie Beauty this is a collaboration
with Miriam NYC this is the highlight
and contour palette I she came out with
two of these from pixie and I am
obsessed with the other one I think
that's called this was this strobe and
sculpt I think that one is like the
sculpt and glow or something like that I
don't remember what I used it just the
other day this week and I absolutely
loved it and has a bronzer in there
that's one of my absolute favorite
bronzers it also has a really beautiful
gold highlight in there that I
absolutely love
but this palette just didn't really work
out for me bronzer which i think would
be my shade is actually shimmer and I
don't really enjoy that this shade up
here I couldn't find any sort of use for
this highlight is pretty but that's the
only one odd this palette that I like
these bronzer shades are just a bit too
dark for me and this could be a nice
blush but it has so much shimmer to it
it just is kind of like a weird
combination between a blush and a
highlight so there's really only one
shade that worked out of here for me so
with that in mind I can just go ahead
and pass this one along moving along I
actually had I pulled two products out
of here that were from my least favorite
products from my favorite brands video
this one is from Becca cosmetics this is
the back light priming filter
unfortunately this primer just did not
work for me I didn't really enjoy it on
my skin I thought it made me look like
too oily and kind of greasy especially
by the end of the day every time I wore
this one it just did not seem to work
well with my skin gonna be getting rid
of that one I have another pair of
lashes here these are from elf cosmetics
these are their winged and fold luxe
lash kit these lashes just did not look
good on me at all I mentioned them and
it fails in one of my makeup monthly
videos they just did not look cute at
all so I've only worn them like three
times but I'm gonna go ahead and get rid
of them this is one that definitely I
was holding on to because of memories
and because of nostalgia and I just need
to let it go it is from Too Faced it is
the natural eye palette this is the very
first palette that I purchased from Too
Faced it was one of my very first
high-end palettes that I ever purchased
and I was like so proud and so excited
to have this one this is like the
old-school one to face then like
damn to the packaging and everything
this is like the original one that tells
you how many years ago I bought it it
was a very loved on palette you can tell
I hit pan on this shade there's a huge
dent in this one right here and also
quite a dent in this gold shade down
there too I love this palette I used it
all the time I thought it was so fun
hand with these little cards that I
still have in there to like give you
ideas for eye looks which as a such a
beginner back then such a beginner back
then I mean I wasn't even watching
YouTube yet when I bought this palette
like that it was so a lot of your guys
but I absolutely love this palette but
it's older I really don't reach for it
anymore and I know I just have to say
goodbye mascara that I have in here is
voluminous feline from L'Oreal okay that
took me a second to figure out who who
it was from it is from L'Oreal this
mascara just really didn't do anything
for me at all I'm not a huge mascara
person because I wear false lashes so
much so I mascara really has to impress
me and this one like I barely noticed I
even had mascara on my eyes so I'm gonna
get rid of that one this is some
blotting paper and rosehip oil is from a
company called I think it's called Mike
to her yeah my couture it says it's
instant glow on the go beautifying paper
I don't know I tested out this like
paper makeup in a video a couple months
back and it just really did not work for
me at all so I'm just gonna pass that
one along because we didn't really vibe
together another pair of lashes I'm
gonna get rid of our from house of
lashes these are in the style
heartbreaker my mom sent these to me for
my birthday and I loved them I wore the
crap out of them they look absolutely
ridiculous they're so drinky like they
just need to go they there's no way
those things can go back on my eyelashes
they look ridiculous this is a mascara
from unique when I first started youtube
I knew someone who was selling unique
and she asked if she could send me a
couple of items and she sent me the
mascara but we just really did not get
along this is the moodstruck 3d fiber
lashes there's like a transplanting gel
and then the three fibers I really just
thought it was such a hassle and like I
said I typically wear lashes so I just
want a mascara that looks
good and one to two coats but it was
really weird because you had to put on
like you had to put on this first which
was like they call it the transplanting
gel which first of all like that sounds
like terrifying and then this was the 3d
fibers and I remember opening and just
being like totally weirded out I was
like um I don't think there's any
product in it and she was like no it's
actual fibers and then they'll just
cling to your eyelashes and I'm like
okay but no it just it didn't really
work out for me and like I said it was
just way too time-consuming and as
someone who just doesn't really wear
mascara very frequently it just doesn't
make sense for me to keep it around so
I'm gonna go ahead and get rid of that
one from a unique and then let's see I
have a palette here from Pierre this is
the revolution palette I just say a
little palette here
with five different shades and a mirror
I thought this palette was fine I
created a lot of like different smokey
looks with it because it is quite a bit
darker but it's just such like a mini
palette like yes it was good for
travelling but I just have my other
palettes that I love so much more and I
was really trying to really be good
about decluttering so I'm gonna say
goodbye to the Pierre Revolution palette
nation that I'm saying goodbye to is
from Wet n Wild this is the photo focus
a foundation mine is in the shade buff
bisque I will put this in my blog sale
because I only used it a handful of
times but I just could not I just did
not see why everybody was loving this I
thought it looked really bad on my face
I did not like it at all and I feel like
I'm one of the only people whose
foundation that did not work out for
which is the power but I'm gonna pass
that one along and then this is from
Sigma Beauty I think I mentioned this in
my least favorite products how many
times did I reach into this bag okay I
guess almost three times I reach into
this bag but this is their zeal loose
shimmer it's their loose shimmer in zeal
is the shade of it so this is what they
look like I just don't really wear these
like shimmers and glitters a lot so
they're just kind of been like clogging
up my collection so that is why I wanted
to pass them along this is another one
from a wet n wild it's one of their
liquid catsuit liquid lipsticks this is
in the shade berry recognized these just
did not work for me wait these were in
my video too
was my entire okay I rescind those bye
pretty much maybe I guess for freaking
everything that was in my li syrup
products remote reference video
apologize for that I could have swore it
was only the one time I reached into
that bag
maybe I bet what I did is when I was
pulling for that video I was then
putting them into the declutter bag
because that would make them upset okay
that makes more sense because I was like
I could have swore I only remember
reaching into that bag one time that's
probably what I did but ya know this one
went in a wild they did not work for me
I bought so many different shades none
of them worked out I'll be putting these
in my blog sale as well because I did
buy these all myself I bought so many
different shades they just said not to
work out for me
the bank is getting slightly lighter but
we are not done yet okay inside
oh gosh you guys this is some bears hang
it so I just threw this whole thing in
here because I saw it when I was going
through my drawers that one sad night
and I was like why why did you keep this
around it was like last year I did a
full face using makeup from the
drugstore basically didn't like any of
it but I put it all in here and was like
I'll keep it just in case
why do I do that like why there's a
color maids eyeshadow palette there is a
la color bronzer that was a total
shimmer bronzer I remember I really just
like that and LA colors blush there is a
la colors liquid makeup I think this was
the foundation and that was not pretty
at all there's a wet and wild concealer
and then also a la colors mascara why I
kept all of this I don't know they're
all going they're all going because
that's just beyond ridiculous and I have
some more of those paper makeup things
from my couture this is the highlighting
paper it's just a really work for me
like interesting concept but it just
really really did nothing for me and
then I also have this is from L'Oreal
this is their True Match blendable
foundation in the shade classic pan
which obviously you can see is way too
dark for me I bought this because I
watched a Jaclyn hill video when I was
first starting out and she was sharing
how to cream contour using foundation
and so that's why I bought it to cream
contour with back in the day but then I
always kept it around to to be able to
mix a couple drops in in case my phone
shade was too light I could mix this in
with it but I have other foundations now
that I can do that I have to peer like
bronzy or selfie that I do it with quite
a bit and this is fairly older so I know
I just need to get rid of that one this
is the NYX micro brow pencil I really
did not like this one we did not get
along at all I think I probably still
have plenty of product left but oh yeah
I have yeah you okay well that's
embarrassing but I definitely have
plenty of product left if that just
shows you how much I did not like this
but I bought this in the beginning like
when I was first trying to do my brows
because you guys might know when I first
started my youtube channel I did not do
my brows wow that made a lot of people
angry but I bought this one because it
was like more affordable and I thought I
could practice with it but it was like
so hard and Scratchy
it legitimately would take my eyebrows
out like when I would get done I would
have eyebrows on my face and like
eyebrows like stuck to the pencil
because I had to like press that hard it
was crazy that doesn't know go for me
also in here is the LA girl Pro
concealer this is in the shade toast I'm
pretty sure yeah toast I bought this
from Ulta because I always hear people
raving about these I bought one in a
concealer - that should be in here and
this I bought for like my cream contour
shade and I did not think they were good
at all I was super unimpressed with them
so I'm this these will go in my blog
sale this one is from moody sisters this
is an eye color in the shade born to be
it was just like a pigment but I just
very rarely use these because I think
that they're really time-consuming so
they are not in my favorite to use at
all and then let's see Alyssa's from
Lancer skincare this is their volume
enhancing lip serum I am pretty much out
of this I actually used this quite a bit
and carried it in my clutch with me a
lot so that just is gonna go in the
garbage because that one is pretty much
gone this is another like nostalgia item
in here - this is the brow bar to go
who else would watch Carli bybel back in
the day and she was always using her
brow bar to go she would use it for her
brows but she would also use it for
eyeshadows this was one of like money Oh
G eyeshadows I would always put this
into my crease and then I would put that
on the lid that's what I did I never
used this for my brows not once because
I was always too afraid
because I didn't do brows back in the
day so even though it was called brow
bar to go this is what I used as my eye
shadow and this just really needs to go
it was by whitening lightening who I
think is now Gerard cosmetics if I have
that correct or I don't know if they're
still the same brand or they're
different brand I'm not sure but I
bought that solely because of Carli
bybel and that's actually but that
really makes me laugh to see that in
there this is from buxom cosmetics this
is in the shade Celeste it's like a
sparkly lip gloss and I just do not wear
these like I just I just don't aware of
them so I knew I could get rid of it
this is from a flower beauty this is
their kiss me twice a lip and cheek
chubby so it looks like this I did work
with flower beauty on that one brand
makeup tutorial and they sent them along
this as like a blush / the lip color and
I tried it out and I was like this was
just not for me so I didn't feature it
in the video I just knew immediately
that this isn't something that like I
use this isn't a color that I would use
so I just immediately put that aside
because I know I can pass it on to
someone who would actually use it and
then this is from wet and wild this is
their their glitter so it's like the
silver glitter and now to get on with
these very well and I bought a silver
and a gold maybe the gold one is in here
I don't remember maybe it was the silver
one I didn't like one of them looked
really beautiful and the other one was
like an oily mess that barely showed any
glitter at all it was really bizarre I
bought them at the exact same time the
exact same location and they were two
completely different formulas and
different finishes it was super weird so
I'm gonna go ahead and just get rid of
that one it is pretty old anyways this
is another sigma glitter this one is in
Uriel again I just don't use these so
there's no reason to have them be
clogging up my collection this I
received from influencer it was from
Jane Eyre Adele it was a pure and simple
makeup kit and medium I test it out a
bit to be able to review it I don't know
I just think gravitate towards it a ton
it wasn't my absolute favorite there was
a couple different powders in here blush
eye shadows but then I came with these
really like weird you know like these
like old-school brushes and I remember
like taking the survey to review it and
they're like what would you change I'm
like put a product in instead of putting
in these weird like little brushes that
people don't use like this thing was so
scratchy like people don't really
gravitate towards these and a lot of
times people have their own brushes I
was like leave the brushes out and like
put in a different makeup product or
something so I know I just didn't really
love on that one so I'm gonna go ahead
and get rid of it and then the next item
I have here is from alla belladonna this
is their loose mineral powder in
Nicoletta I mentioned this in a fails
video it just didn't really do much for
me and I just don't really gravitate
towards these at all so I'm gonna go
ahead and pass that one on this one is
from Revlon this is the photo-ready skin
lights face illuminator and this is in
pink light this is another one I bought
because of Carli bybel and I thought it
was so funny I bought it and I could
have swore when I watched her video that
she put this on under her eyes like I
thought for sure that's where she put it
so I did a trip to New York a couple of
years ago for a book signing and I was
so excited I went out and bought this
all like yes I'm gonna be just like
Carli bybel and I'll put it under my
eyes I'm not kidding you guys I put this
underneath my eyes like like how you
would a setting powder like I used I
used this to set my concealer mm-hmm I
did that that was me so that happened so
in every single one of those photos from
that night in New York like my eyes just
look crazy like they just look so crazy
it is insanely embarrassing but I did
that I did that I don't really use like
the liquid highlights anymore and that
one is extremely old I don't even
remember how many years ago that book
signing was but that one does just need
to be tossed because I'm sure it is
expired this is the other la girl Pro
concealer this one was in the shade what
shade is this natural I just don't love
it fer concealer I didn't think it
really did anything for me another Sigma
ravishing loose shimmer that I would
just will not use this was in one of my
MC bags this is from Hikari
it was a shimmer bronzer and like I
don't want my brother Doug shimmer in it
I just that's just not really for me so
I just didn't really get on with this
one like these four little different
pans in here like these would be pretty
highlights and that could be a pretty
bronzer except all the shimmer did fall
into that that would be a nice blush but
they're so tiny you can get your brush
into it so I didn't really get along the
best with that one so I'm going to go
ahead and get rid of those I have a
lipstick here from a Smashbox this one
is in
crimson chrome it was like a Metallica
red I don't really like metallics and it
got everywhere like it doesn't drive mad
at all but it was like all over my chin
on the sides of my face on my hands I
was like how how am I getting lipstick
in all of these different places like it
was crazy I didn't really love that one
this one is from touch and soul it's one
of their Metellus a liquid oil lipstick
duo's I don't know if it has the shape
names I'm here though not a hundred
percent what the shade names were but
they were having this at Sephora and I
decided to pick it up trying something
new it's a metallic lipstick it wasn't
really for me that was a bad decision on
my part that was a bad decision on my
part my bad and then we have some more
of these paper makeups this one is the
blush paper again I just don't have a
use for them almost there so then the
last couple items that I have here this
one is from Pierre this is the elevation
pellet this one actually was kind of
hard for me to give up our I did like
this palette but I ended up like I
caught myself just not reaching for it a
ton and reaching for other highlight
palettes more so I decided to give it up
it's pretty decent a highlight palette
I'm not gonna lie this shade was just a
bit too dark for me but I did really
like these two it's this one it was kind
of tough to say goodbye to I was really
in that decluttering mood so that's why
I got rid of that one and then also the
pure Browder I just did not get on with
this product at all it's a really
interesting brow products but I'm much
more like I just need a brow pencil and
this is what the Browder looks like it
was just too hard for me to learn like
I'm trying really hard I used a pomade
the other day and it was difficult for
me like I just used pencils and that's
about it this is from gorgeous cosmetics
it's an eyeshadow palette this was a
really decent eyeshadow palette actually
it does have a big mirror on it as well
I just
it wasn't gravitating towards it I
wasn't using it enough again like with
everything in here I put it in here for
a month if I didn't reach for it I was
getting rid of it so even though this is
a really I thought it was a pretty
decent eyeshadow palette I just wasn't
reaching for it enough to be able to
keep it and then the final item this
wasn't her this was a hard one to get
rid of - this is from Pierre and this is
a
they're like illuminating palette but
these are cream highlights the reason I
decided to get rid of it is because I
don't use cream on highlights a ton but
when I first got this I was using it so
often but now I'm much more of just like
straight powder highlight that is what I
prefer so I decided that I could pass
this one on as well so it is a nice
highlighting palette I just don't reach
for it enough all right so I'm finished
bag is empty it is ready for a new
declutter to get filled up again and I'm
not gonna lie I went through all of the
products and I count on them up and
there was only 46 items in there and I
really thought for sure I had at least
over 50 so I'm not as impressed with
myself as I thought maybe I would be I'm
not sure if I'm going to do another
makeup collection declutter it like this
the next time where I go through and
just kind of pull everything for my
collection and show you what I think I'm
gonna do actually is a lipstick
declutter because that section of my
collection needs some help
I have run completely out of room for
like all of my lipstick storage like I'm
out like I'm out and if you follow my
snapchat you saw what happens when I
leave a lipsticks on the floor my dog
ate a bunch of Maca lipsticks and it was
a very very sad day so I think I'm
actually gonna do a lipstick declutter
next and hopefully I can at least do 50
lipsticks can I do it that sounds like a
lotta lipsticks look at me lately I'm
like I'm starting to break out already
I'm like 50 lipsticks no but that's
gonna be maybe my goal
maybe my goal for my next declutter so
what I wanted to talk about next was
kind of the blog sale how I mentioned in
the beginning so I know a lot of people
typically do have questions with the
clutters like where are those products
going and what are you doing with them
what I do and what I think is pretty
normal from the declutter that I've seen
is that I do three different piles I do
like a toss pile and that's things that
you know are just super old or wouldn't
really be able to pass along to anyone
like you know things like mascara and
things like that where it's just not
sanitary to give to someone else and
then I have a pile that was sent to me
in PR or something that I did not by
myself I can pass those along to friends
or family members you can also donate
them to some shelters in my area which
I've done in the past and a house will
have a third pile and that is things
that I have bought myself and that I'm
going to be putting into a blog sale
to be working on the blog sale I hope by
the time this video goes up I will have
it ready to go on my blog which the
website is chiclet plus com
I'll have it linked down below and
hopefully I will have the exact link to
the blog sale but I was really inspired
by my friend Lisa Stevens here on
YouTube she has so many amazing to
clutter videos and she was talking in
one of them about her blog sale so I
went checked it out and I was like I
love this idea
I basically am just gonna be taking the
items that I purchased myself with my
own money and then selling them on my
website you know I will be cleaning and
sanitizing everything before I put it
out for a blog sale I'll be listing
everything you know the shades that they
are things like that and then the price
for them and then people can email me in
if you are interested in that item
everything for the blog sale like I
don't want to get too in-depth into the
details because it will all be listed
over there you know things like shipping
who can buy how the buying process
actually works I'm basically just gonna
be doing everything that Lisa does
because I think her blog stated it so
well so thank you Lisa for that I'll
have Lisa's channel a link down below to
go check it out because she is amazing
to clutters over there but that's where
all of like the you know how the blog
sale will actually run and I hope to
just basically be able to keep a blog
self going as much as I can I hope to be
doing a lot more the clutters here at my
lipstick collection definitely needs to
cluttered my highlight collection

recently did a brush to clutter I'll
leave that down below and all of the
brushes that I purchased myself will be
