back today with a new makeup declutter
this is going to be part 1 in my eye
shadow palette to color and it is going
to be focusing on affordable or
drugstore eyeshadow palettes here we go
I'm really excited though because
Poshmark actually reached out to me
again and asked if I would like to do
another video with them I did one last
week another declutter with my face
palettes which I will leave link down
below so they asked if I would like to
do another one and I thought okay you're
really you're making me do this
eyeshadow palette declutter ok I get it
so a big thank you to posh my first
sponsoring a portion of this video stay
tuned until the end because once again I
will just go through I have my Poshmark
account already pulled up here I will
just go through it quickly and kind of
show how I add items to my Poshmark
account you do not have Poshmark yet I
will leave that link to the app down
below it's free to download and all of
that and it's been really handy for me I
just did a big closet purge as well and
put up a bunch of my items on the
Poshmark app but I will do a few of that
at the end but if you are ready to see a
new declutter for my eyeshadow palettes
let's just go ahead and get started
righty so where do we even begin this
has been a kneading to happen for a
while and I decided to break it down
into affordable and high-end a to try to
make the video a little bit shorter in
length but then also not to be so
overwhelming for me because this this
declutter has has been in my list for a
while but it really was kind of
overwhelming to think about but let's go
ahead and just jump right into it so the
first one right here this big one from
morphe this is the new a 24 g or korean
glam palette i know i'm going to be
keeping this one i just got it in at PR
and i've only used it one time so far if
it's up already I will have an Instagram
video using this for eyeshadows bronzer
blush and highlight so if that's all my
Instagram I will have it linked down
below but I just got this one I really
don't have full thoughts or anything yet
so will be keeping that one this next
one here is from makeup revolution if
you can see areas in the background she
always likes to be really close when we
do declutter this one is from a makeup
revolution I just talked about this one
recently
my beauty battle video and it is a do
palette for the Kat Von D shade and
light palette this one is called the
ultra eye contour light and shade I paid
$15 for it at Ulta but really I'm gonna
go ahead and put it in my past pile in
my Poshmark pile because I just don't
really reach for this one if I want
these types of shades I'm reaching for
my Kat Von D because they're more
pigmented they're easily blendable and
it's just a better quality of this
eyeshadow palette so maybe if I didn't
have the kat von d palette I would get
more use out of this one because I like
matte neutral looks but I just don't
reach for it enough so I'm gonna go
ahead and put that in the past pile
they'll also have these two here from
morphe these ones were also recently
mentioned in the beauty battle video we
have the 25a palette and then at the 25
@b palette i said that you know
basically these palettes are virtually
identical with you know formula and all
of that
there's just obviously a bit of a
difference of shades and all of that I
do prefer the 25a and so I was like you
should get rid of the 25b but I still
like them both I don't want to get rid
of both of them I like them I like the
formulas I like the colors in here when
I did the battle I had to choose a
winner which was 25a but really I said
you know depending on your color
preference I don't think you can go
wrong with either palette so I want to
hang on to both because I like them I
like them both are you sad that we're
declaring I'm sorry
I know the clutters are hard at least
it's not your toy box already moving on
I put this one from dubious place in the
affordable side I wasn't really quite
sure but I thought maybe dubious place
is a little bit more affordable than
others this one is the masquerade mini
palette I did have this one is sent to
me from a subscriber and I think this
palette is so gorgeous it is very very
pigmented and it just has so many fun
and unique colors when I want something
really colorful I know I can go in here
and I just think it's really really nice
it's my only palette from dubious place
so I definitely do want to keep this one
but it's a really nice palette next up I
have this one from a bad habit this is
the Aphrodite palette now I do have a
few other palettes from bad habit that
were sent to me from a shop hush and
also a few more kind of dupe palettes
that were sent to me from the shop hush
hall I didn't want to include
them though because it was kind of
overwhelming I mean they sent me quite a
few pallets and I just I can't
physically be trying out all of them at
the same time plus any other pallets
that I'm getting or buying etc so I
chose the Aphrodite to be the one that I
was really testing playing with being
able to review and all of that so that's
kind of why I didn't with those because
I just don't really have good opinions
on really anything else lately and it's
like they haven't been fully integrated
into my collection yet so I thought for
the interest of the declutter and saving
time and all of that I would just put
this one on here because I've been
trying this out quite a bit I really do
like this eyeshadow palette this one was
also mentioned in my beauty battle video
and at one the dupe palette round but I
really enjoyed this one I also do not
have the high end you know the the
palette that this one was duping which
is a huda beauty palette I don't have
that one so I think about is another
reason where I really really like having
this one I love the colors in here the
pigmentation is pretty nice overall and
I believe this palette is like $12 and I
definitely think it would be worth of
twelve dollars and I just I really like
this one I like the mirror I like the
shades inside so I do want to go ahead
and hang on to this one next up I have a
color palette this one is a
collaboration with kathleenlights in
dream Street I just bought this one at
fairly recently I definitely do want to
hold on to it I did put it in my
underwhelming makeup category because I
didn't get like as hyped as I thought I
was going to be for this palette but it
still is a nice palette I still do like
this palette and all of that and it's
one of my newer palettes so I do want to
hang on to Dream Street and then the
palette right next to it is also from
colour-pop and this is the all I see is
magic palette again this is another
palette that I purchased myself recently
just before the kathleenlights one
actually and I really really enjoyed
this palette I I don't know if I
expected to enjoy this one as much as I
did but I think it's really pretty I
love the shade variations in there the
color pop rest i shadow formula is
really really nice so I do enjoy this
one and again it's fairly new to me so I
do want to keep it next up I have this
one here from ELF this was just sent to
me in PR and I put it aside because I
just really enjoyed these tones in here
this is called the nude rose a gold
palette I have not had a chance to try
it out yet but it's been sitting in my I
kind of have like a to try pile
on the desk behind me for items that I
know that I need to try and review so
obviously I'm gonna hold on to this one
and since it hasn't been used yet okay
so I have this one here from BH
Cosmetics this one was sent to me
recently from a subscriber this is
called the wild child baked eyeshadow
palette this is what the inside of it
looks like I'm excited to try this one
out because I don't think I've ever
tried any of the baked eyeshadow
palettes from BH Cosmetics I'm not for
sure how many it is that they have but
I'm excited to try this one because I
used to have a ton of BH Cosmetics
eyeshadow palettes and then slowly over
time I started to get rid of them used
them up dropped one it shattered it was
very sad but as they got older and stuff
I started decluttering them out of my
collection so I think it's fun to have
another one back here has anyone tried
the wild child palette I would love to
know but I do want to hang on to that
one next up I have this one here from
Maybelline this is one of the city mini
palettes so I was kind of disappointed
in this one because I felt like a lot of
people were really talking these
palettes up and being really excited for
him and while I don't think it's like
the worst palette of life I just don't
really reach for it I think it's just
okay and all of the shades in here are
shimmer shades so I can't really get a
complete eye look I look with it it's
more like I do an eye look and then I
come in for like one shimmer to top off
a look and so I just kind of find myself
not really ever reaching for it but I
don't know I felt like these were
getting a lot of hype and they didn't
quite make me as hyped as I saw some
others so I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter this one except I have to hear
from ardell and these are called the
sensual eyeshadow palettes and I again I
just I didn't really find these to be
fantastic
I actually was pretty excited because
I've only swatched this one but this one
I did try on my eyes and I was really
excited when I did I think I put it in
like a first impression or I get ready
with me type of video and I was excited
and I thought they were pigmented and
the shades were coming out looking good
on my eyes and then like an hour later
they'd basically faded into nothing
and I was like oh no so I tried it again
with a different primer you know maybe
thinking but
the primer is a part of it but they just
do not last fall on the eyes which I was
pretty bummed about I know our del is
kind of expanding their line and
including more makeup items which i
think is really cool but unfortunately
these eyeshadow palettes just really
didn't do much for me so I'm gonna go
ahead and put these in my past pile as
well next up here I have the perfect and
eyeshadow palette this is from a soap &amp;amp;
Glory this was sent to me from my
subscriber which I was really excited
about because this was the first time I
tried soap &amp;amp; Glory makeup so this is
what the inside of the eye shadow
palette looks like I know that I have
actually used it quite a few times and I
like it it's not a palette that I find
to be like overwhelmingly amazing still
do enjoy it I think it's a nice palette
especially kind of for like a more like
softer romantic kind of like ma flick
this is what I find myself reaching for
a lot with this palette so I do like
this palette and it's it's always really
special to me when things are a gift so
I'm gonna go ahead and hold on it to
this one as well doing as well as I
expect it once again good stuff good
stuff these three are from colour-pop
this one right here I don't know if this
palette has a name or if it's just kind
of one like a palette that was kind of
like put together or a pop kind of first
started coming out with the press eyes
shadow palettes and you could kind of
make your own little palettes with them
so there's a gold in there and then kind
of like a pinky shade kind of a coral
color I would say and then a deep brown
I've really enjoyed this palette I'm
trying to think because I know I have
the two other color pop ones as well but
I really enjoy all of these shades in
here and I think that they're so pretty
I really enjoyed the color pop formula I
don't know what to do I feel like I
could declutter it but I like it and
sometimes declutter I'll be honest are
really hard because like if you don't
declutter enough people are like that
was so pointless and if you declare too
much people are like you're so wasteful
so it's like you can't really win with
the clutters which is really frustrating
but I don't know I try to tell people to
remember that makeup is personal
preference and you know sometimes for
whatever reason someone wants to keep
something or wants to declutter
something but my first thought was to
declare this one but honestly I still
use it and I still like these shades and
I don't think I have these kind of like
repeat shades in the colour-pop formula
so I'm
hold onto it I really do I really do
like the pallets and then these two here
are from the I love Sarah II
collaboration so this first one is in
Shiki absolutely love this palette this
one goes traveling with me a lot these
are just like my tones I love that I can
come in here and just create just a
simple go-to I look it's literally one
of my favorite palettes I enjoyed this
so much definitely need to keep that one
and then the other one from the I love
Sarah II collection is called soft sea
and this one has Purple's which I love
Purple's I know you can't see me but I
have purple on my eye today you know
what maybe that shade oh that I just
stuck my finger in maybe that one is a
little bit similar to the one in the
first palette no cuz this one's like a
deeper orange and the other one is a
lighter pink so I was thinking you know
maybe I could just declutter a single
out of that one but you know what no I
stay in front of I'm staying firm but I
also really enjoyed this palette I love
those purples in there I think they're
really gorgeous so I do want to keep
this one as well I think if these are
still available I do highly recommend
them that I love serried collection I
thought it was really really good if I
have another color pop palette this one
is the yesplease palette my friend
Candice did some this one to me and I
was so excited because man everybody was
like raving about this palette but isn't
it weird I feel like nobody talks about
this one anymore and I don't know if
it's just because color pop has come out
with so I mean they come out with a
palette like every other day but I felt
like this one was getting a ton of hype
like a ton of video was on it and I just
feel like I haven't really heard
anything else up lately but it's still a
really nice palette I enjoy it I really
like that yellow in there and kind of
the oranges the Reds like I do still
really really like this palette so I
definitely want to keep it big thank you
to Candice for sending this to me but
yeah I do enjoy this one it was one of
my newer palettes this is from a sleek
makeup I recently did a first impression
with this one and then I also did review
it in a first impression follow-up this
is a really nice eyes shadow palette
like I was kind of surprised at how much
I ended up enjoying this palette it's
available also for like $13 or something
like that and it is nice and pigmented I
mean I said in my review like it's not
the most like overwhelming eyeshadow
palette and it's very like neutral base
but it's still really really nice
especially for the price and you get a
mirror again one of my newer palettes
and my own Leah palette so far that I've
tried from sleep makeup so I do want to
keep this one in my collection well next
up I do have the two palettes here that
Carli bybel did in collaboration with BH
Cosmetics the first one is the the 14
color eyeshadow and highlight palette
that came out first so that is what the
inside looks like and then they came out
with a revamped palette the deluxe
edition that has 21 colors i shadow
shades and then also highlights in here
this palette is definitely better than
the first palette I mean not only is it
bigger and you get more shades and more
highlights but the even the shades
inside I think are just even better
quality I love the highlights in here
this is such a nice eye shadow palette
it's easy to travel with even though
it's a bit bigger I still feel like it's
easy to travel with I like the packaging
on it I love the marble Carli bybel is
just one of my absolute favorites so
what I'm going to do is hold on to this
one and then I'm gonna go ahead and put
the smaller palette into my Poshmark
pile since this one I did purchase don't
really have a need for both especially
because some of the shades in here are
repeated in here so it's like it's just
not really necessary to have both so I'm
gonna keep and then pass on the next up
here I have the olympus appellate from
Christiana and cosmetics I really enjoy
Chris Anna Anne's brand I've worked with
her quite a bit and I just I like a lot
of what she puts out this is the olympus
palette i also do have some singles from
her as well i think i'm gonna do a
single eyeshadow palette declutter as
well i don't even know what all I have
like makeup geek and honest Asya Chris
Anna and things like that I think maybe
I'll do a separate one for that if that
sounds good but this one is the olympus
palette from Chris Hanna and I actually
just pulled this out fairly recently I
used it in my like New Year's Eve look I
didn't film it or even I don't even know
if I made a video in my New Year's Eve
look it was just you know going to hang
out with a friend's house but I used
this color right here and it is so so
gorgeous I kind of feel like with this
palette it's a little bit hit or miss
some shades are definitely better than
the others I wish there would be like
one more transition in here but but
overall I still do enjoy the palette in
is a bit more affordable I have a
discount code with Costa Ana and that
I'll put on the screen here but since
this is her first eyeshadow palette I
definitely do want to keep it in my
collection and I love being able to
support indie brands and Christian
and it's really awesome I of course will
have all these pallets linked down below
like I always do but yeah I'm definitely
going to keep the Olympus so all I have
left now are some more more feet alit's
I have bought quite a few more people
'its and I've also been sent some morphe
palettes as well the first time that I
ever got a PR package from morphe that I
sent me quite a few of their eyeshadow
palettes which was really amazing but
these are what I have left so let's just
go through them and see what we need to
keep and what we can declutter this one
is the 35p okay so this one I have never
used and I really wanted to because it's
full of purples and I absolutely love
purples
but I still have not reached for it this
one is an older formula for morphe and I
just feel like their new eyeshadow
palettes are just so much better and
then with some of the other newer
palettes I've been getting I feel like
the formulas are better so that's what
I've been reaching for for my purples so
I've actually never even got into this
one this one was sent to me in PR so I
would not be selling it but I know that
my niece really enjoys morphe and I've
been sending her a few products too and
you know I could pass it on to friends
and things like that but I'm gonna go
ahead and say goodbye to this one if
I've had it for how many months and I've
still never used it like I need to say
goodbye cuz that's just embarrassing
next up is the morphe Jaclyn hill
palette I absolutely love this palette
was mentioned in my favorites video
definitely we'll be keeping this one I
just I just love it and it inspires me
so much I thought I hit pan oh my gosh I
thought I hit pan on there looks like
it's just just a little
something-something but oh that was kind
of crazy but yeah definitely a favorite
palette of mine I will be keeping that
one next up I believe this one is the
new yeah 3 502 so this is the updated
version of at the 3 504 morphe and I
love this palette I think it is so
beautiful
definitely will be keeping this one the
formula is fantastic in here I love the
shades I love this palette so I'm going
to go ahead and keep that one alright
next up here we have the 35s this is
another one that I almost purchased
myself from morphe several several times
I ended up not doing it I did get it set
in PR and I think I've only used it one
time so again I could pass it along to a
friend or family member but can I just
with the older formula of morphe it's
just not as good so I just reach for the
palettes that I find that I enjoy a
little bit better so I'm gonna go ahead
and put that one in my declutter pile
next up here we have the 35 our old man
this is a tough one
I do enjoy this palette but I already
know that I'm keeping a lot of morphe
palettes I did purchased this one myself
I was really excited for the 35 are but
now I'm kind of thinking between the
three 502 and the morphe Jaclyn hill is
it really necessary to keep this one
because I know there's a lot of reapeat
shades in here if this formula is so so
good in here but I'm I just I know I
know that I'm keeping allowed of the
morphe palettes so especially between 3
500 and the chocolate Hill I think this
one I can I can say goodbye to I think I
can do it so I'm gonna go ahead and put
that one in my declutter pile I feel
like I want to be asked that I said to
get rid of it and then this one here is
the 35 tea this is actually the first
morphe palette that I ever purchased if
I can open it this is the first palette
that I ever purchased oh my goodness it
has been used and abused and loved on
and wow I really liked it this palette I
love the tones in here they're totally
me but alright I think I can go ahead
and declutter this one honestly is very
very old I don't think it's gone bad or
anything but it is extremely old and I
kind of want to hang on to it for
sentimental reasons but I also know that
my eyeshadow palettes are taking up a
lot of my space and I could probably be
a little bit better at it but this one
definitely got a ton of love I got my
$22 worth with this eyeshadow palette
but I know it's been quite some time
since I reached for it again going back
to this is an older formula and I like
the newer ones better so this is my
first more view palette but I'm gonna go
ahead and put it in my declutter pile
mmm okay so then this one here is the
3/5 oh this was the like original
totally hyped up I showed a palette the
reason I got the 35 T is because the
3500 was continually sold out so the
3500 obviously now has the three 502
which is the revamped one of this
palette but this is where my YouTube
earnest is going to come into play and I
am going to
go ahead and hold on to this one it's
nice for like comparison videos and
things like that so also you know try to
keep in mind that sometimes if you watch
YouTube videos and you see these bigger
collections it's nice to be able to
reach for certain pellets for certain
comparison videos or you know dupe
videos or just anything like that it's
nice to be able to have that on hand so
I do want to keep that around mostly for
youtuber reasons I mean that's something
that you can agree or disagree with but
it definitely is something that happens
it's nice to be able to pull out a
pallet I don't know if people understand
like maybe how often a youtuber gets
asked to see a swatch like I son
swatches through my snapchat all the
time for someone whether it be eyeshadow
palettes lipstick something they want to
see a swatch of something so they can
compare it to something else it's really
nice to be able to go into and it
actually just happened with this
particular palette so I think that's
kind of why it's fresh on my mind and
why I'm so intent on keeping this one
because you can kind of help people out
that way too so I'm gonna go ahead and
put that one in my keep pile and then
the very less eyeshadow palettes that we
have is the morphe and a Kathleen lights
collaboration this was actually sent to
me from my friend Tinka this came all
the way from Italy and it got to me in
perfect condition which was crazy I
really like this palette I feel like I
don't I mean obviously this is an older
palette but I don't feel like I really
hear anybody talking about it are using
this palette too much I have used the
greens I've used the moths in there I've
used the golden there I love this color
so much I really like this palette I was
so excited when she sent it to me
because this was one that was a limited
edition it was actually limited edition
and I don't know maybe it came back once
I'm not really for sure but it hasn't
been available for a very long time so I
thought it was super cool when she sent
that to me and I love tanka so much
she's one of my good friends and I
definitely wanted to keep this one
around I thought it was really nice that
she sent it to me so I'm gonna go ahead
and keep that one okay so that is it for
the eye shadow declutter I will just
show real quick how I would put in a
shadow palette up on my Poshmark so on
top here was the BH Cosmetics and Carli
bybel palette the 14 color so what I
would do coming in to my Poshmark you
would just hit this button down here
which says sell and then you would take
a few photos in here so I take a photo
of
the front of the palette I'll also take
a photo of the back and then I will also
take a photo of the inside I have all of
the different photos taken you would
enter in the details so when it asks
what it is I'm going to say it's the BH
Cosmetics and Carli bybel palette
already so I have the name and then I
described it and then I would come into
the category here and you would choose
makeup and then I'm gonna choose
eyeshadow and then you do have to put in
a size so for makeup you're typically
just gonna list one size and then for
brand I will see if they have BH
Cosmetics they do not so I'm gonna go
ahead and just type in BH Cosmetics and
add it manually you'll also want to put
in the original price which I believe
was I think it was $20 and then you
would put in your listing price but I'm
gonna go ahead and list it at 8 it will
show your earnings when I sold but other
than that that's it you would just hit
next and then list and it would go in
your closet that way so then you'll see
there that I added a new listing so that
is how you would add something to your
Poshmark closet and again you can see
kind of like an overview of my closet
here I'll have that link in the
description box down below it is a free
app to download and all of that so if
you haven't yet I will have that listed
down there and you can see that I have
some makeup on here like sunglasses
clothes bags shoes and again thank you
to Poshmark for reaching out and letting
me work with them on another video this
was super cool and I try to do two
clutters on a pretty regular basis
otherwise my collections do get a little
bit out of hand and I like being able to
either donate or pass along give to
friends and family you know things like
that
I think that's pretty cool to do what
the dick letters and then now also
Poshmark is a big part of them as well
which i think is awesome but i did go
ahead and lay out the collections here
so with this one over here is my keep
pile I believe I kept 21 pallets and
then this one over here is my declutter
pile and we declutter 9 so again not my
best declutter to date but I'm happy
with everything like looking over my
collection that ever of everything that
I kept I'm happy with everything there's
really nothing in there that I'm like
girl you probably could have gotten rid
of that I'm happy with what I have in my
keep pile so I hope that you guys
enjoyed seeing another
de-clutter again my high-end eyeshadow
pallete declutter will be coming very
shortly I'll have my declutter series I
linked it down below in case you're
interested in checking out any of my
other ones but if you guys did enjoy
this one I hope that you will give it a
thumbs up I hope that you will also
consider subscribing before you go and I
will catch you guys in tomorrow's video
