today's video is going to be a new
declutter I'm going to be to cluttering
my concealers over here on this side and
then I'm also going to be declutter
encoder face powders setting powders
foundation powders things like that so
that's what we have on this side so I
will have my declutter playlist a link
down below in case you're interested in
checking out any of my other deke
letters that I have done recently but if
you would like to get started on this
declutter when we go ahead and jump into
it so I'm going to work on
concealers first it's what I really want
to focus on this is where I put my
concealers it's just like this little
acrylic bin here and it's just kind of
gotten a little bit no no no just a
little bit out of hand concealer wise
for me I know there's a couple in here
that are almost empty or that I just
really don't like so I want to get this
kind of knocked down a little bit here
so just kind of reaching in for them the
first one here is from Urban Decay this
is The Naked skin concealer this is like
my favorite concealer at the moment I
mention it in my best of 2017 video I
love this concealer so definitely going
to be keeping that one I also have in
here from Tarte this is the heart-shaped
tape of course so many people love this
concealer and I am definitely one of
them I know about out though I really do
need to repurchase this concealer I
really do love the Turk shape tape so I
do want to keep this one and use it
until it is completely gone also in here
I have the Maybelline fit me concealer
if you can tell in here that it is
pretty used up I've been using this one
quite a bit lately too because I know
it's almost gone so I keep reaching
forward to try to use it completely up
but I kind of have to dip back in at
least two times to put under just one
eye so it is about empty so I'm gonna
just go ahead and toss it I know it's
been open for a while and I have very
very few uses left so I can go ahead and
toss that one I have to hear from Kevin
a Quan at Kevin a Quan did send me a PR
package with their supernatural
concealers so the two that I kept for
myself one is in light and the other one
says ICI corrector and it's just
actually a little bit darker than the
other one but I really really enjoy this
concealer as well I believe I mentioned
it in my best beauty video if I didn't I
should have because I reach for it quite
a bit it kind of remind
me it's kind of like a cross between the
Urban Decay Naked skin and the tart
shaped ape kind of like right in the
middle of both of those but I really
enjoyed these ones so I'm gonna hold on
to those this one here is the L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow this one I do like
this one it's a little bit dark for me
so I like mixing it with the color pop
no filter concealer that I just got
that's too light for me I kind of mix
these two together it's pretty good it's
not my favorite concealer but I still
like it and I like that it's a drugstore
option so I'm gonna keep it for now and
then next up I have this one from NYX
this is their sculpt and highlight duo
so there's a concealer on one end and
then a cream contour shade on the other
I mentioned this I believe it was in my
flashback Friday - my best - beauty 2016
video this was a favorite in 2016 but I
mentioned when I was doing the flashback
video that I don't really love it as
much anymore and I don't reach for it as
much and I know that it's almost
completely gone you got very little
product on each side and I know this
one's about used up anyways so I'm gonna
go ahead and declutter this one so did
find my pure cameo contour stick I
believe I mentioned this in the
flashback video as well and I was so
upset because I couldn't find it I did
find it in one of the drawers when we
were repainting my office I had to move
everything out and I put a bunch of
makeup into a drawer and then forgot to
empty it out completely so I did find it
which was good but I did mention in the
flashback video that I hadn't even
realized that I had misplaced it which
is not good there's a concealer on one
end and then the contour stick on the
other I'm mostly reaching to this for
the contour stick but since I couldn't
even remember that I had misplaced it I
am gonna go ahead and declutter it but I
did get quite a few uses out of it I
really did enjoy it and then next up in
here I have the number 7 radiant
concealer I really like a lot of
products of from number 7 this one is a
bit of a different kind of applicator
there and you kind of click it up to get
the product to come out this is a really
light coverage concealer but it does
give a really nice glow to the under
eyes I reach for this one mostly in the
summer look I haven't reached for it
lately with the colder months and I just
need a little bit more coverage around
this time but I am still gonna hold on
to it because I think it is a really
nice concealer I also have in here the
Maybelline a better
Jannik concealer and this one is pretty
much gone I really enjoy this concealer
this is definitely one of my favorites
both the Maybelline fit me and the
Maybelline butter skin I just think they
are both really solid concealers if
you're looking for good ones from the
drugstore I would suggest both of these
but yeah this one is pretty much empty I
mean you can see in there it's really
tough for me to get product out and I
have to dip back in like three four
times just to get some concealer onto
the wand so I'm gonna go ahead and toss
that one also in here I have the tarte
rainforest of the sea aqua concealer I
mentioned this in my makeup I love but
everyone else seems to hate video a lot
of people really do not like this
concealer but I really really do I'm
gonna go ahead and keep it still and I
don't know if you'd be able to tell like
there is a pretty good dent taken out
because I really enjoy this concealer so
I'm gonna go ahead and keep that one
this one is a from a flower Beauty this
one was sent to me from a flower beauty
it kind of reminds me a bit of the
number seventy one like applicator
style-wise and you kind of click this up
to get the product out
unfortunately the concealer is not a
good match for me it was too light and
almost like too yellow for my under eyes
and also it just ended up not being my
favorite formula ever so I gave it a
couple tries but this one was not my
favorite so I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter that one I also have in here
this is from julep this technically is
considered a foundation it's the five
and one what's this called five on one
cushion complexion the skin Perfector it
says that you can use it as a foundation
you can use it as a concealer you can
use a mess cream contour cream bronzer
things like that and this one is in the
shade linen and this is what I use as a
concealer I just go in with a pretty
light hand and use a damp Beauty Blender
when I want to use it as a concealer but
I think it's pretty nice and it's fairly
new to me but I have still been reaching
for it so I'm gonna go ahead and hold on
to this one I also have in here the
Urban Decay all nighter concealer this
is their new concealer I have the shade
medium light neutral and I also have
light neutral but I don't know where
that's at it might be sitting on my desk
because I do really like this concealer
when I reviewed it I said I wouldn't be
able to call it a favorite and I still
stand by that it's not a favorite
favorite but it's like a notch below I
do reach for it quite a bit it's very
full coverage it's fair
easy to blend and I like the way it
makes my under eyes look it's just a bit
of a dryer formula so I have to kind of
be a little careful with it especially
around this time of year but I am gonna
go ahead and hold on to these because I
really have been enjoying them this one
right here believe this is from amazing
cosmetics yes this is the amazing
cosmetics hydrate concealer this one was
just okay to me I've had it for quite
some time I definitely liked it more
than the other concealer that they sent
to me which I will show here in a little
bit it was a little bit light though
like really really light but it was nice
and creamy I just you know I haven't
really reached for this at all I think
if I'm trying to be cutthroat with my
declutter I I think I should go ahead
and get rid of this I could pass it on
to a friend or family number two because
there's still quite a bit of product
left in it and I don't think it's gone
bad yet so I wouldn't need to toss it so
I can go ahead and pass the song maybe
to someone who's a little bit fairer
than I am I have a couple concealers in
here from morphe okay I have four I have
a four morphia concealers in here these
were sent to me by morphe and
unfortunately i really don't like these
I believe I did a video of my least
favorite products from my favorite
brands and I believe I mentioned that
the morphe concealers cuz I like
morphine and I own a lot from them and I
like the brand but these concealers did
nothing for me they're like three times
drier than the Urban Decay all nighter
which the all nighter concealer is about
the driest I will go with a concealer
formula and these ones are even drier
they're very hard to blend out kind of
once you put them on the eye it's like
it's just stuck there and it really
didn't look well for me so I do not need
to keep these around I know this shade I
never even used so I could pass that on
or donate because I can't donate use
makeup where I'm at so I could even
donate that one if someone would get
better use out of it these other three I
did use so I wouldn't be able to donate
but I could pass them on and see if
maybe other people like I'm a bit more
than me but I feel like I don't really
hear a lot of great things about the
morphe concealers but I'm gonna go ahead
and declutter those for also in here I
have from amazing at cosmetics this is
the other concealer that they sent me
and this is the I think it's just called
the amazing concealer but wow this
concealer is like no other concealer
this is what it looks
but it is so thick and so I mean it's
very full coverage and I hear like this
is what the celebrities use and this is
what they use for like red-carpet events
and stuff and I get it because it covers
everything but it's just like for every
day it's just not necessary for me even
if I want a full coverage this is just
still too much no matter how
light-handed I go it's just too thick
and too much so I very rarely use this
because it makes my under eyes look
crazy so I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter this one I've been here this
is from a Kevin a Quan and this is
called a sensual skin enhancer and I was
a little confused when I got it cuz I
was like what is this but it's basically
you can use it as a concealer you can
use it as a foundation I'm sorry I tried
to change my camera settings and the
autofocus now is like very very strange
this is okay it's just it's just a lot
like it's not quite as intense as the
amazing cosmetics concealer but it's
kind of a lot to deal with I like it
more for just kind of like spot
concealing kind of hesitant on this one
I'm kind of looking at my piles like how
how am i doing I think I'm gonna go
ahead and keep it for just a little bit
longer
it's Kevin Taquan it's very it's very
pricey and I was very excited to get
this little package in here I'm gonna
keep it for just a little bit longer and
see how I do if I haven't used it a lot
but the next time I declutter I'll get
rid of it but I want to keep it for
right now I also remembered to go and
pull out the colour-pop no filter
concealer this is still in my like kind
of testing new makeup drawer my review
on it will be coming I think in
tomorrow's video I'll be doing my black
friday haul follow-up and I have some
more thoughts on this concealer
unfortunately the shade is too light for
me but like I said I like to mix it with
my L'Oreal pro glow which is a little
dark and then it's okay so I'm gonna go
ahead and hold on to this this is
probably my newest concealer that I
purchased I have this one here from
gorgeous cosmetics and again I really
did not enjoy this one it's in the shade
light neutral it's a way way too light
for me and I just didn't love the way it
made my under eyes look either I used it
for when I was reviewing yet which was
quite some time ago
and then I don't think I ever touched it
again because it just wasn't a favorite
of mine so I'm
go ahead and declutter that one and I
also haven't here the last one is at the
Maybelline instant age rewind this is a
favorite I've been through so many of
these and you can see that you know
that's pretty down there as well but
this is a favorite I feel like this is a
favorite of a lot of people as I see
this mentioned so often even now this is
a older older product but it's still so
freakin good
I'll be keeping this one this is the
bottom here are my two piles and really
cool I am at keeping 12 and decluttering
12 boom I feel like that's the best I've
done on a declutter in a very long time
so that is pretty cool but yeah keeping
at 12 concealers at getting rid of 12 as
well so I am pretty happy with that's
gonna be it for concealers so let's jump
over into the setting powders okay so
next up we're gonna work on these are
like my setting powders or face powders
things like that up I have this one from
a julep Beauty this is fairly newer to
me but I really really like this powder
and when I first opened it up I was like
okay sure it's a white powder so that's
weird but it actually makes the skin
look really really nice I even like the
little applicator with it I just take a
little bit and dust it all over my face
and it really does give you a very like
smooth flawless finish I've really been
liking this one I took it traveling with
me over Christmas as well I thought that
one was very nice so I'm gonna hold on
to that one I have these two here from
pure cosmetics if you're not new to my
channel I've talked about this product a
lot this is the four and one pressed
mineral powder and I get mine in the
shade tan now I have been buying these
since forever this is my older one and
then when I started running below I went
out and picked up a new one as well I've
been buying these since I was in college
it was kind of like my first powder
foundation ever I just found it at Ulta
and kind of like randomly bought it but
I have continued to love on this and
continued to repurchase it several times
over the years I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter this one because it's it's
pretty down there and it's it's you can
tell it just needs to be tossed it's
been open for a very long time and I
have the back up ready to go so I'm
gonna go ahead and declutter that one
and keep this on but yeah this is one of
my favorite favorite products so I do
want to keep that one this poor little
guy this is the Rimmel translucent
powder and the cap broke fairly recently
but
cap did break this is one where I am
shocked that you cannot see that I have
hit pan because I have had this product
for years I mean years and I've used it
so much I know that I am light hand it
with makeup and I I don't ever like
overdo it with makeup but I'm still
really surprised that I have not hit pan
on this one this is such a nice powder
it is so affordable it's just such a
staple when I was first starting out my
makeup collection I was always seeing
this recommended and it is what I bought
and I really enjoy it because I have
lost the cap and because I know I've had
it for a very long time I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter it but honestly even
no matter how many powders I decide to
keep if I'm at like CVS I kind of want
to repurchase it just to have it in my
collection it's just been a favorite of
mine but this one's very old has no cap
it's very sad I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter that one this one here is from
winkie luxe and this is called the
diamond complexion powder and medium
this was sent to me from winkie luxe and
I am not gonna lie I don't really get
this product because they say it's a
complexion product but when talking with
winkie luxe I said you can use it to
like set your face makeup you can use it
as a powder foundation you can use it to
set your under eyes and I was like I
don't really get it because it has just
like very loose kind of shimmer to it
nothing too overpowering but I'm like I
wouldn't want to put that on my under
eyes they even said you can use this as
like a subtle highlighter I'm like I
don't get it I don't feel like it's that
Universal that I can do that many
different things so I don't really quite
understand this product and I barely
reach for it so I'm gonna go ahead and
pass that one on maybe someone else will
love that one more than I do this next
one here is at the Maybelline butter
skin skin transforming powder I really
love this guy and I always have it in my
clutch with me I like taking it out at
nights because it's very small and
compact if it's easily into my clutch
but it's a great powder and I even like
this little applicator guy with it so I
don't have to worry about like packing
an extra powder brush or anything like
that so I am always traveling with what
this one it's one of my favorite powders
as well so I definitely want to keep
that one also from Maybelline I have the
master fix by face studio setting powder
so this is a loose powder from
Maybelline I bought this
it's kind of like you know hoping to
find like a drugstore alternative to
some of my favorite setting powders but
unfortunately this one gives a very very
intense flashback it's not a big deal if
I'm not going anywhere or you know maybe
I'm just filming a video but if I'm
going out and about I really don't want
to wear this because the flashback on
the under eyes is pretty extreme so I'm
just gonna go ahead and declutter this
one that loose powders aren't so much my
favorite anymore but I don't need this
one I know I tend to avoid it most times
but one that I really do enjoyed this is
a good drugstore alternative here this
is pixi by petra and it is their quick
fix translucent powder what you can do
is you can kind of pop the cap off like
that and then you have a little
applicator here so you just kind of
shake some product up and press it onto
your face but what I do is actually just
take the whole cap off and then I can
dip my Beauty Blender our my brush into
this loose powder and I like it better
than the little sponge that comes on it
I actually really do like this powder
and it's not too overwhelming it doesn't
leave a white cast on me and I think
this one is a good drugstore alternative
so the pixi by petra I'm gonna go ahead
and hang on to this one the one that is
my favorite of powder is the Elora
mercier secret brightening powder I have
used this one quite a bit and I just
really liked it
it's the secret brightening powder so
not that translucent powder that
everyone has lost their minds over but I
really do like this one because it does
brighten up the under eyes and
especially like last year and like late
2015 even I was super into like very
very bright under eyes like concealer
brightening powders and this was the one
that was kind of always my go-to so I do
want to keep this one I still do enjoy
it when I'm going out and about and I
want to really lock my makeup into place
a lot of times I'll be reaching for that
one this one is from Tarte a cosmetics
and this is their smooth operator
Amazonian clay finishing powder I do
like this one as well I wouldn't
consider it an absolute favorite but it
is still nice I reach for it every once
in a while I like it for my under eyes
but I kind of like it to use with a damp
sponge and kind of press it into my face
I feel like it leaves it really did it's
a smooth
yes smooth because I was going to say it
leaves your face like I'm very smooth so
that makes sense with the name smooth
operator I do like it for that use
so I'm gonna go ahead and hold on to
this one too because I do like it this
one here is from Kat Von D and this is
the locket brightening powder and - in
at the shade peach so I bought this when
I was definitely like in my loose powder
craze which like I said I have kind of
gotten over but this one I don't know
what it is with this bottle but I don't
know if you can tell on camera it is so
messy no matter how I close it no matter
how tight I make sure I close it it
still gets powder freaking everywhere
even when I'm not even using it so that
kind of drives me crazy the powder is a
bit darker it has like that peach tint
to it which is to help kind of brighten
up the under eyes but I almost worry
that it's a little bit too dark on me
and especially in the winter time it is
for sure too dark for me so this and
this I don't know it's not been a
favorite anymore and especially with the
coloring and the packaging I think I'm
gonna go ahead and pass this one on I
feel like someone else could could love
this one more than I can and then the
last one here is from Maybelline and
this is the afib a matte and poreless
powder in a 310 and you can tell that I
have really loved on this guy and I've
gotten a lot of use out of it I do think
that this is a really nice powder I
haven't used it in a while because I
either am reaching for my pier or my
other maybelline powder but I do like
this one I'm kind of looking at my piles
again like how did I do
how did I do should I keep it I mean
really I only kept my pier and the
Maybelline face powder like this so I'm
gonna go ahead and keep this one too I
do like this one a lot and now that I've
declutter some other ones you know maybe
I'll be reaching in for this one as well
so I'm gonna go ahead and keep this one
okay so these are my two piles and it's
kind of funny because I'm keeping seven
and decluttering five but I kind of want
to just because I was really excited how
I deal with my concealers I think I want
to pick one from my keep pile and put it
in my past file so I can be at 6 and 6
and this is so the top choice I was
either between the Maybelline or the
Tarte but I think I'm going to pass
along the Tarte because I just don't do
the loose powders as much anymore and I
think I would use the Maybelline more so
those are the two I kind of struggled on
so I'm going to take tarts and I'm going
to put it into the declutter pile so now
we'll have six and six on each so yay so
that is my keep pile for my face powders
and setting powders and then my
declutter pile so that's pretty good I
feel very proud and accomplished with
this declutter today oh that's awesome
so after that that's gonna do it for
this round of decluttering is 8 to 4 at
my latest declutter video I hope you
enjoyed seeing me declutter my
concealers and my setting and face
powders if you guys didn't enjoyed this
declutter I hope that you will give this
video a thumbs up I hope that you will
also consider subscribing before you go
and I will catch you guys in tomorrow's
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
