today's video we got a new declutter
I've been promising my high-end
eyeshadow pellet declutter for ever and
it is a finally time to work on this
collection I believe I have 53 palettes
here so we need to do something about
this my storage is kind of a mess lately
and I just know Ares is with me of
course just know like looking at my
collection every day when I'm deciding
to pick out an eyeshadow palette I know
that there's plenty of palettes in here
that I just don't reach for anymore
maybe I don't even like you know that
sort of thing so this declutter is much
much needed so if you are ready to see
my high-end eyeshadow palette collection
and declutter why don't we go ahead and
get started
okay I'm just going to be randomly
jumping in here I don't have them set
out in any particular order or anything
so first up this is one of my new
eyeshadow palettes this is the orb of
light a full moon palette from a Black
Moon cosmetics I just had a subscriber
send this to me I've already used it
twice and I think I want to use it in my
next kind of get ready with my style of
video and recreate one of the looks that
I did recently because I really liked it
and it got some good feedback in the
video but I definitely want to keep this
one I've only had it for a handful of
weeks right now so I'm gonna go ahead
and keep that one this one is the violet
boss Holy Grail eyes shadow palette I
talked about this palette a ton it's in
my March Madness makeup video I just
really enjoyed this palette it's one of
my favorites definitely want it to be
keeping it this one you can tell it's
gotten gotten a lot of love from me so I
will be keeping that one okay let's see
this one here is from a Pierre cosmetics
this is the Eswari diaries eyeshadow
palette I really I honestly really do
like this eyeshadow palette like
reaching into it because it's just it's
so neutral and it does still have like a
variety ish of colors like especially
these different shimmers in that last
row it's like whatever I want to do I
can create that look with it so I think
I actually want to keep this one yeah
I'm gonna go ahead and hang on to this
one next one is the Kat Von D st. in
Center eyeshadow palette my friend Liv
sent this to me and I love this palette
I have raved about it in past videos I
really really enjoy
this eyeshadow pellet packaging is super
cool love the shades inside definitely
going to be hanging onto that one I just
got this palette in my pl box just like
two days ago I think it was the busy art
neutral matte palette I have wanted this
palette for so long it has been on my
wish list forever but I've just never
been able to I've just never been able
to do it and I was completely surprised
when I got this in my peel box my
subscriber did say that she wanted to be
kept anonymous and I will do that but
thank you so much you know who you are
and I appreciate it so much I'm so
excited to have this obviously I will be
keeping it I've only tried it one time
so far okay next up I have here from
Pierre this is the My Little Pony
palette that they did I actually did not
like this palette at all and I was super
bummed because I do also have the trolls
palette in there I really liked the
trolls palette and I was really excited
for this palette and it's just not the
same quality as the trolls and I just I
just didn't really love it I know I
think a lot of other people do enjoy it
but for me it just didn't do anything so
I'm gonna go ahead and put this in my
past piles up here I have the lorac Pro
a brunch palette I did purchase this one
myself like very shortly after it came
out for whatever reason I was just
really excited for this pastel palette I
remember it was in the springtime I just
thought the springy pastel colors would
be super fun to play with and I like
this palette like don't get me wrong I
like it I like the looks that I've
created with it but I'm not super hyped
about it anymore and I have another
pastel palette in this collection or
that will be in this video from Sigma
that I prefer more for a pastel palette
so with that being said I am gonna go
ahead and put this one in my path pile I
have this one here from Pier this is the
trolls palette like I was saying I
really really like this eyeshadow
palette and it kind of really caught me
off guard I wasn't expecting to like it
as much as I did and I really really
enjoy this palette I recommended it in
my gift card my gift card guide video
that I did fairly recently where I gave
recommendations to Pierre this is the
crude eyeshadow palette I really enjoy
it definitely want to hang on to this
one alrighty next up I have this one
here from a coloured raine this is the
berry cute palette I did have a
subscriber send this one--it's to me as
well so it's just one of the many
coloured raine palettes and it has a six
different shades inside
played with it quite a bit but honestly
I still don't even feel like I have a
really good handle on it I think I need
to come back in and play that a few more
times I do want to hang on to this one
and I want to play with it a few more
times so I'm gonna keep very cute okay
so next up I have this one here from
Sigma this is the warm neutrals volume 2
palette I'm gonna try to get through
this as quickly as I can since we do
have 53 so sorry if it does end up a
longer video so I do like to talk but
this is the warm neutrals at volume 2
palette from Sigma Beauty I really enjoy
this palette as well
Sigma makeup for me is a little bit
hit-and-miss but I was really pleasantly
surprised with this eyeshadow palette
really liked the shades in here like I
like the shade selections I like the
screen I like this red this pink is
actually a really cool color I just
ended up really enjoying this eyeshadow
palette so I do want to go ahead and
hang on to those and also has like my
tones like warm neutrals like yes that
is my tones so I'm gonna go ahead and
keep that one next up I have this one
here from Tarte this is the tartlet
toasted eyeshadow palette or just this
one at myself as well and I was really
excited for it and when I got it
I know I've reviewed it on my channel
and I said like when I got it I wasn't
quite as excited for it as I thought I
was going to be I kind of just feel like
I'm doing the same look every time I
reach for this palette and I decided to
hang on to it because I actually
considered returning it I decided to
hang on to it so I was like oh it'll be
nice for like comparison videos and like
upcoming YouTube videos things like that
there are certain things that I do keep
around knowing that I can feature them
in upcoming videos and it's just helpful
for me or it's nice to be able to do
comparisons or things like that like I
send swatches to people like I like will
send snap photos to people like swatches
of stuff quite a bit so it's nice to
have it around but honestly I'm kind of
mad at myself that I did that because I
barely reach for this palette I mean I
have plenty of other eyeshadow palettes
that have these tones in there and again
I just I'm not the most inspired when I
reach for this palette so I'm actually
going to go ahead and put this one in my
past pile okay so next up here this one
is the one from Sigma that I was talking
about this is the creme of de Couture
press color palette so this one is the
pastel palette that I really enjoy kind
of tell with this one in comparison to
the lorac like even
you open it the shades inside are just
more vibrant right off the bat and I
think that it's just a really nice
eyeshadow palette it definitely has the
pastels in here like you see these over
here they're very pastel shades but
they're still vibrant they're so
colorful they're still there and I don't
have to work with these shades as much
as I do that lorac one so I'm gonna go
ahead and hang on to this one from Sigma
okay and then I have this one here this
is from lorac this is the Pirates of the
Caribbean I shadow palette and I'm gonna
keep this one I just think it's super
cool this was sent to me from lorac and
I was so excited about it because I was
considering purchasing this one and when
it showed up on my door I was so excited
about it
I like the shades inside love the
packaging on this but I just think this
is a cool eyeshadow palette man like I
just want to keep it cuz I think it's
really cool okay okay all right so next
up here I have this one from Smashbox
this is the shape matters it's called
like the fotomat eyes palette I believe
and inside it's all neutral all matte
shades and it does have a nice brush and
I actually do like that brush I've had
this palette for a while and it used to
be one of my favorites but I've noticed
that I just don't reach for it as much
as I used to I really did like these
shades I liked how there was differences
in here like there was the pinks and
there's a blue in there there's also a
black but then you also get all of you
know the Browns and the transitions and
the warm tones and the cool tones I
really enjoyed this eye shadow palette
but I honestly cannot remember the last
time I reached for it so I think that
means that I can go ahead and pass this
one on and then let's see I have the
tartlet in bloom eyes shadow palette
this one was definitely like a YouTube
made me buy a palette everybody raved
about this palette so I had to have it
and again I do like it I do like this
eyeshadow palette I feel like I can
create a lot of different looks with it
like I like the selections of matte and
shimmers in here and it's just kind of
like one of those staple eyeshadow
palettes of my collection so I'm gonna
go ahead and hang on to that one next up
I have this one here from a Kevin Taquan
this is the electoral pop palette this
is just a really cool eyeshadow palette
has a nice mirror in there it has these
different shades they're very like
creamy shades they feel more like a
cream to powder type of shadow and I
just think the colors and they're are
really cool it pushes me out of my
comfort zone it's definitely not like an
all-inclusive palette because they are
all shimmers besides
Matt down here but it's still really
cool to come into and I've liked the
looks that I've created with it so I'm
gonna go ahead and keep that one so I
have this one here from a dose of colors
this is the sassy siennas palette I
don't know why I sell the plastic on it
no no this is one of my newer palettes I
clearly haven't even taken that plastic
part off yet but I love the dose of
colors eyeshadow palettes I think that
they are fantastic I want them all I
think I have three now and I just think
they're all great
so definitely keeping this one I love
these tones in here this palette is just
fantastic highly recommend dose of
colors next up here I have the modern
renaissance from Anastasia Beverly Hills
again I love this palette this
definitely is like one of my holy grail
I shadow palettes I am super light
handed when it comes to my makeup like
you very rarely see you very rarely see
me hit pan but like I don't know I'm
just not like I don't know how to
explain it but I'm just very light
handed when it comes to my makeup like
what this one I feel like you can tell
right like you can tell that this
palette has been loved
but yeah the Anastacio Modern
Renaissance one of my absolute favorites
definitely need to keep that palette but
I also have the subculture here and I've
reviewed the subculture I've talked
about the subculture in past videos and
I do like this palette I honestly do I
think it's a nice palette but when I was
thinking about this declutter I actually
was like you know what I think I'm going
to declutter subculture and again not
because I don't like it or because I
think it's crap or like I can't use it
because I can't I just was wearing it
the other day but I got the dupe palette
for this from shop hush it's the bad
habit I think it's the retro love
palette and I actually like that palette
more and it's I mean it's the exact same
thing as this subculture the colors are
the same but I like that one more I did
a comparison video between the two and I
was like you know what I think I need to
give it to retro love and I pulled this
out the other day to try it again and I
was like you know what I still think I
like retro love more so I actually think
that I'm gonna go ahead and declutter
this I like you subculture you caused a
lot of drama but I liked you but I think
I can go ahead and say goodbye to it
actually alrighty next up I have this
one here from Tarte this is in
collaboration with a styled by her Uche
if you watched my channel like I don't
even know a year or two ago you were
seeing
this palette talked about all of the
time because I was so obsessed with this
palette and I still honestly love it
it's just a little mini compact palette
it has six eyeshadows in there and then
a blush but I use this all of the time
this almost always comes travelling with
me no matter where I'm going I love that
I can create a really basic look with it
I can amp it up love that I have the
blush shade in there it's so easy to
travel with like this is one of my
staple palettes and has been for a very
long time so definitely want to keep
that one as well alrighty next up I have
this one here from Urban Decay and
Kristin Lee Ann this is the new
collection that just came out so this
one is a very simple eyeshadow palette
it has a brush in there you just have
five shades they're all matte shades but
I really like this one I like pairing it
with the other palette that was in their
collaboration which is coming up here
shortly I like this palette this one's
totalling me again this one could be a
good one to travel with as well and just
create those kind of like basic looks
but I really like this palette the whole
collab really impressed me so I'm gonna
go ahead and keep that one next up I
have this one here from Tarte this is a
collaboration with a graveyard girls the
swamp Queen palette this one was sent to
me from my friend and Tinka I like this
palette again because it's kind of one
of those more all-inclusive ones that
have eyeshadow shades and then also a
face shades I do want to keep this one
I love tanka so much I was so excited
when she sent this to me again I do like
that I have eyeshadows and face shades
to play with as well so I'm gonna go
ahead and hang on for that one I have
this one here from dose of colors this
is in baked Browns again I love the dose
of colors eye shadow palette I actually
like the brushes that come with them so
I usually keep them in there this is I
mean this is a fantastic eyeshadow
palette I love this one definitely
keeping it loved dose of colors next up
here I have this one from Urban Decay
this is the distortion eyeshadow palette
it's a more recent eyeshadow palette and
it's okay but I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter it because I just don't reach
for it a ton I like the concept behind
it I think it's cool I've played with it
I I played with it a couple times and it
was fun to like put this black shade
down and then put some of these
transformer shades on top and it would
create really cool looks but it's just
not something that I reached far enough
and I think someone else would be even
happier with it so I know that I can go
ahead I did give this in PR so I would
pass this on
to a friend or family member but I think
someone else would get more use out of
it than I do so I'm gonna put this one
in my pass file so I believe we have six
declutter and I have kept 18 so far so
doing just as well as I expect it to so
this next one here is a from Mac this is
the affection fanatic palette I just
thought this palette was okay but it
wasn't anything special to me you have
these different eyeshadow shades and
then you also have a highlight in here
they were just okay to me I wasn't wowed
or anything so I'm gonna go ahead and
put that one in my past pile this one
here is from NARS this is the wanted
eyeshadow palette I can never open up
NARS eyeshadow palettes okay so this is
the wanted eyes shadow palette I really
do like this eyeshadow palette this was
my first one from NARS as well so it has
a little bit of a special meaning to me
but I like the shimmers in here I wasn't
completely like totally blown away like
absolutely raving about this palette but
I still do like it so I'm gonna go ahead
and hang on to this one and then let's
see I have these two here from the Mac
and Patrick stark lab I was really
excited to receive these in PR and
really quite surprised and I really
really enjoyed these I think these were
my favorite part from the collection so
this one here is the gold getter palette
you have a really nice gold shimmer in
there and then these mats are just a
really really beautiful enjoy the looks
that I've come up with in that palette
and then this one is the glam AAS
palette and again I really enjoy these
tones as well I'm filming in my living
room because I thought there would be
better lighting but I'm not really sure
that there is but I really do like these
palettes these Mac shadows were much
better than what was in that palette
which had me very happy so I'm gonna go
ahead and hang on to those and I also
have another one here from lorac this is
the beauty and the beast' collab and I
freaking love beauty in the Beast just
so much I love beauty the Beast I was so
excited again to get this one in PR I
was just so shocked I love the packaging
on this and I really do like the shades
inside again it's not something that's
like overwhelmingly a favorite of mine
but I really do like it I especially
really like this last row especially for
right now I'm super into like the pinky
romantic looks so I do want to go ahead
and hang on to this one one of my newer
palettes here is from the balm this is
the meet Matchmaker I shadow palette and
I
really like this eyeshadow palette I
reviewed it fairly recently as well but
I was very impressed with this I like
that we have these little duo's in here
I like all of the shades inside I've
created some really cool looks with this
one as well and just very happy with
this one so I'm gonna go ahead and hang
on to meet match maker
next up I have this one here from
Charlotte Tilbury this is the instant
eye shadow palette I believe is what
it's called I have reviewed this one on
my channel and unfortunately I said that
I just did not love it and I just I
don't see it worth the $75 price tag it
has a mixture of matte shimmers I like
the inside I like the layout I like the
shade selections in here but you really
have to work to get a good eye look and
for that price tag I just don't really
feel like that's that should be the case
it's also plastic packaging which i
think is weird for such a high price i
shadow palette and i just didn't love
this one so I'm gonna put that one in my
past pile next if I have this one here
from a peer it was in collaboration with
at Tian Ortega who is a celebrity makeup
artist I actually really enjoyed this
eye shadow palette like it has my tones
in here you know J'son side have worked
out really well for me and I like the
looks that I've created so I'm gonna go
ahead and hang on to this one this one I
just got in the mail and not too long
ago this is from Urban Decay this is the
Naked palette I got this one from Urban
Decay along with some lipsticks and I
was so excited I have never owned this
Naked palette and I remember starting to
watch youtube videos and everybody would
talk about the Naked palette and I never
had it and it was too expensive for me
to go out and buy so I'm gonna get like
choked up here but to get this one for a
bourbon decay was so cool again I just
got it I haven't even used it yet but
I'm really excited about it and I'm
definitely gonna be keeping keeping this
one that was a really cool moment to be
honest let's see let me go over here I
have this one here from Anastasia
Beverly Hills this is just a little
palette that I made for myself but I
figured I would include it so it has
four single shadows in here we have
birkin burnt orange pink champagne and
then henna I have talked about the
anastacio single shadows on my channel
in the past that I just don't really
like them I prefer her eyeshadow
palettes at first sure especially the
two shimmers in here and especially pink
champagne which I got because like
everybody raved about it I
really like them burnt orange is in the
modern renaissance palette so I think
I'm just gonna go ahead and declutter
this whole little bundle here I
purchased it on alte it was a special to
get the palette and then the four shades
inside and I don't know I mean I tried
them I wasn't wowed and because like
really only Birkin is the one that I
enjoy but I mean I have Birkin in other
palettes let's be serious
so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and say
goodbye to this one from Anastacio okay
next up here I have to hear from huda
beauty again these are newer palettes to
me I have two of the new obsessions
palettes that this one is in smokey I
just talked about these palettes in my
most recent makeup monthly and I put
them in the favorites category this one
is the warm Brown obsessions so
obviously I love them they're newer
palettes to me these are gonna be so
great we are going on vacation in a
couple weeks here to Arizona and I've
already been thinking about what makeup
to bring and like I'm trying Mitch and I
are share in a bag we're only checking
one bag so I need to think a light when
it comes to makeup and I'm probably
gonna bring both of these because I feel
like they're really great for travel so
I'm going to keep that one next up here
I have this one from dose of colors this
was in collaboration with Katie Ann and
desi this one is is one that I think is
just okay but I'm gonna go ahead and
hang on to it
I mean clearly I've used it several
times the shades are just a little bit
hard to work with a little bit hard to
get on the eyes I don't really love
using my fingers like I said for
applying makeup but it really does apply
better with your fingers you will have
to use a setting spray with almost all
of them in here so it's just a challenge
I always like the end looks that I get
with it I just wish they're a little bit
easier to use but Katie and desi are two
of my favorite influencers so I do want
to keep that one and next up I have this
violet boss palette this is in hash tag
I did have a subscriber Jill send this
one in to me I've only had it for I had
maybe like a month or so now I've used
it plenty of times I did just review it
in my makeup monthly and I put it in the
fine category but I still do want to
keep it I like the violet boss I shadow
I like the mattes more than the shimmers
actually but I do like the violet Voss
shadows and I think between this one and
the Holy Grail like I have quite the
selection of shades so I'm gonna go
ahead and hang on to the hashtag palette
as well
next up here I have this one from Tarte
this one is the make believe in yourself
palette a lot of shimmer shades this
myth one is a matte and then it does
have a highlight in the center it really
likes us I shoulda pail it when I first
got it and I wore it quite a bit but I
really can't remember the last time that
I reach for this palette and I'm just
thinking about all the other pellets I
kept and all the other shades in there
like I feel like I have all of them in
other palettes so I think I'm actually
going to go ahead and say goodbye to
this one I did like it a lot but I
haven't reached for it enough lately so
I'm gonna go ahead and put that one in
the past pile I have this one from
Pierre here this is one of the vanity
palette I talk about another vanity
palette this one is in dreamchaser I
talk about gold digger quite a bit but I
like that one as a face palette this one
I included in the eyeshadow palettes
because I reach for it more for these
eyeshadow shades right here but I do
enjoy that you get a bronzer blush and
highlight also and I like these palettes
I like that they pop up as a little
vanity I don't know if this one is still
available or not frumpy right if it is I
do like the shadows in here and I like
how all-inclusive it is so I'm going to
go ahead and keep that one let's see I
have the urban decay and naked smoky
palette I like it it doesn't necessarily
like totally blow me away but I'm
thinking because I'm thinking because I
got the Naked palette and it has some
similar tones to it I think that I
should actually declutter this one I
don't know if you can see that at all
with the mirror but I think that maybe I
should actually declutter this one I've
used it enough like I got a good hang of
it again it just it wasn't an absolute
favorite of mine it was okay but now
that I got the Naked palette I think I'm
actually gonna go ahead and declutter
this one yes I think that's the right
move I think that's the right move
haha I know I think I had like what
fifty three pallets and I was like if I
could get close to declutter in 20 I'd
be pretty proud of myself and I don't
really know how that's looking I don't
think it's looking very good though this
is the other one from Urban Decay and
Kristin that Leigh Anne this is the much
more colorful palette in here I really
like this palette again I like the
collab a lot I love the blues in here
the purple this is just a really really
good eyeshadow palette I was very
impressed with it I love these kind of
like these two makes
shades in there I think they're both so
cool love that there's an orange this is
an awesome palette I definitely do want
to keep that one okay next up I have
another one here from a tart this is the
rainforest of the sea I shadow palette
yeah I do like this eyeshadow palette I
think I'm gonna yeah I don't know what
to do like I feel like I know that I
have these shades but I like this
palette a lot and I actually reach for
it quite a bit when I went traveling
last summer like this is a palette I
took camping with me we went on a
camping trip and I was like yes
rainforest of the sea you are coming
with me uh you know what I'm looking at
what I have left and I think I should
declutter this one you know I really do
I'm looking at what I have left and I
know I'm not gonna make my goal of
trying to get close to 20 so I'm gonna
go ahead and say goodbye to it I know I
have other shimmers and other pellets
like I just need to say goodbye I need
to learn how to let go I need unlike
that commercial where you just gotta let
go you know okay this one is from I
Anasazi Beverly Hills it's the master
palette by Mario I definitely want to
keep this one this one was limited
edition and I know a lot of people
really wish they had gotten their hands
on it once again so I'm gonna keep this
one I love the tones in here kind of the
warm tones I think it's a really nice I
shadow palette again I prefer anastasi
as palettes over her single shadows for
sure so I'm gonna keep that one I also
have this one here from Too Faced this
is the chocolate bon bons palette I
really do like this eyeshadow palette I
think I can create some pretty fun looks
with it especially with these pink
shades I feel like when I want a really
pink look this is one of the palettes
that I reach for even though there's
only a like a couple of those pops of
pinks and then it's much more neutral
but for some reason that's the type of
look that I go for when I reach for the
chocolate bon bons palette but I do like
this one I'm gonna go ahead and hang on
to it I have this one here from dose of
colors this is the amar Veloz and mob's
eyeshadow palette again
I love dose of colors I love all their
eyeshadow palettes I'm definitely
keeping that one it's up here I have
this one from a Smashbox this is one of
the cover shot metallic eye palettes I
don't really like these I actually
purchased one and returned it I got sent
the wrong one like there's a something
happened with Sephora and they sent me
the wrong one so then I finally got the
metallic one but I still I just don't
really like it I feel like these didn't
really get a ton of great reviews it
just not very pigmented it didn't really
do much for me so I'm actually gonna go
ahead and put that one in the past file
we are almost done so next up here I
have this one from Kat Von D it's the
shade and light eyeshadow palette this
is one of my absolute favorite palettes
I still continually reach into the sky I
feel like you can tell that this one has
been loved on I love this palette I'm
definitely keeping it next up I have
this one here from Sigma Beauty this is
the wildflower palette I really enjoyed
this palette because it does have a
blush a highlight and then it has some
eyeshadow shades in here as well this
one I find myself taking traveling with
me quite a bit too because I like that
you do get the Too Faced shades but I
like the eyeshadow shades in here
because it's just kind of like like I
have my go-to look with this palette if
that makes sense and I know especially
how I like it for traveling like I wake
up and need to get ready and go boom I
come into this palette I know what I'm
doing so I do want to keep that one next
up here I do have it the tarte at clay
play at palette and this is the original
clay play palette I do love this palette
I raved about it I spoke very highly of
it I recommended a ton I'm incredibly
disappointed what Tarte did with the
clay played to the buckle I did return
that palette but I still do really
enjoyed this palette this is another one
I take traveling a lot I like that I
have a contour in a bronzer shade in
here also and I like the matte shadow so
I'm going to keep this one next time I
have this one here from color green this
is the Queen of Hearts eyeshadow palette
this is a fairly newer palette to me and
I really do enjoy this one I just
reviewed it recently in my indie brain
reviews and I do want to keep this one
the price tag is high on it but I
understand the hype it's a really nice I
shadow palette then in here I have it be
two-faced a sweet peach palette oh man
was I so excited over this eyeshadow
palette I really was I was the one at
Ulta at 10 a.m. waiting for it to open
so I could get this palette because
everybody had lost their minds over it
so I'm definitely keeping this one this
was a struggle to get I'm keeping it but
I do like this palette I did recently do
a throwback Thursday with this one and I
still do enjoy this week peach palette
and then my last palette here is from
Urban Decay and this is the heavy metal
eyeshadow palette this is what the
inside looks like again I've talked very
highly about this palette
I don't think it is available anymore it
limited-edition for the holidays but man
if you got your hands on it I think that
you are lucky because I really enjoy it
it's not necessarily a me palette
because it is all shimmer but I still
think I can come up with some really fun
looks with it
so I'm going to go ahead and keep this
one too let me set everything out and
we'll give it a final look over okay so
I have everything laid out here this one
was at my keep pile
big old pile and then I have this little
pile over here which is my declutter
pile so I have 13 in there and I have 40
in here and I don't think that's good
enough I wanted to get closer to 20 on
the declutter scale so I'm just gonna
take a quick peek over what I decided to
keep and think a little bit harder and
maybe just get rid of a couple more I
just I I truly just don't feel like I
need 40-hour shadow palettes that's a
lot of palettes and so let me think i
one of the first ones that I thought of
was this one from Pierre it's the soiree
Diaries I really do like this palette
but I do definitely have a lot of
similar palettes to it so I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna put that one in the
past pile I'm gonna be good here and
then what else and really I feel like
the only one that I feel like I would be
okay letting go of is gonna be this one
from Too Faced at the chocolate bonbon
palette especially just thinking back to
what I said like oh I like these the
pink colors in here and there's only
really two pink colors and I definitely
have pinks and other palettes I just
feel like I feel like I'm okay saying
goodbye to this one too so I'm gonna put
that one in the past pile so then I have
15 that I declared which is a little bit
better and then what it kept 38 so I
mean still not the best declutter ever
but some of these palettes in here are
like my staples my holy grails that I
truly have to have of course there also
is palettes in here that I am still
trying out and testing and all of that
good stuff so there's what we ended up
keeping and then there is the little
declutter pile there so not my best
declutter ever which I figured would be
with the eyeshadow palettes that was
hard to say goodbye to some of these but
I'm glad that I came back and you know I
declutter two more that's pretty good
but I hope that you guys enjoyed seeing
my eyeshadow palette
election my high-end eyeshadow palette
collection let me know your thoughts in
the comments down below did I declutter
something that surprised you kept
something that surprised you and all of
that do let me know my next to clutter
will actually be a lipstick declutter
and that one will be coming up probably
in the next month or so here that really
needs to get it worked on so I'm gonna
go ahead and put all of these lovely
eyeshadow palettes back and get
reorganized which has me very excited
but thank you guys so much for watching
