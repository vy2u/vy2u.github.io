today's video I am finally back with
another declutter I'm going to be
decluttering my eyeliners and then also
my mascaras I was doing really good I'm
posting her to clutter about every two
weeks or so and then I kind of fell off
the wagon
but I'm here to get back on and I really
wanted to jump into my eyeliners and
mascaras I thought I would do these two
together this is mostly how I store my
eyeliners and my mascaras and I mean
it's just so full especially mascara
wise I can't fit anything else in there
at the moment if you are ready to see a
new declutter might would go ahead and
jump into it whatsoever I want to start
with my mascaras so these are all my
mascaras here and I feel like this looks
like a pretty small collection but for
me it's actually it's too big because I
typically wear false lashes and so
having this many mascaras for me it's
just kind of silly I don't eat this
money the first one here is from a
two-faced it's the better than sex
mascara and this is just basically done
for I was wearing it the other day I
pulled it out and I was like oh gosh
there's basically nothing left to this
I've had it for a really long time I
have repurchased this over and over
again it used to be one of my absolute
favorite mascaras but I actually feel
like now that it flakes too much on the
eyes because when I was wearing it the
other day I even said on my snapchat I
was going through my makeup and I said
of course I have the Too Faced better
than sex mascara on because it's all
over my face so I don't know what it is
I used to love this so much and now I
would not repurchase it because I just
feel like it is too flaky other mascara
that I know is really old this one is
from a Max Factor it's the masterpiece
max velvet black mascara I got this in a
PR package last summer I believe it was
because actually Pat McGrath was doing a
collaboration with Max Factor which is a
drugstore brand and not one that I was
super familiar with but they sent me a
really nice package and I actually
really did quite enjoy the mascara I
used this many many times but I know I
mean it's been opened for over a year
now
and I got quite a bit of use out of it
so I'm gonna go ahead and declare this
one to mascara here is from Catrice
cosmetics it's the rocket or 24-hour
extrema volume mascara this mascara is
one of my favorites I got
pyaare package from Catrice cosmetics
which included this mascara and I tried
it out I think for the first time in my
waterproof makeup video where I was
testing waterproof makeup because I read
online that if this was waterproof and
it made my lashes it look so beautiful
and I would agree that it's waterproof
I wear this so often in the summer
especially days where like maybe I was
traveling and I always didn't want to
you know have a lot of time to put my
false lashes on and I just needed a good
mascara I kept reaching for this one I
would highly recommend this mascara I'm
gonna keep this one this one is a newer
mascara to me this is from ardell it's
their double above volumizing mascara so
Ardell it just came out with like they
explained it their makeup line and I've
gotten a couple PR packages from them
with some of their new makeup products
and this one came with it
I like this mascara it's definitely not
a favorite favorite of mine but I think
it does a pretty good job I'd like to
use it because I do think it is
volumizing but it's not super a
lengthening and I have like tiny little
lashes so sometimes I'll use a more
lengthening mascara and then I'll come
up with this one to volumize afterwards
so I still think it's okay it's just not
my favorite but I'm gonna go ahead and
keep it and I would like to have more
drugstore options to four mascaras so
I'm gonna hold onto this one this one is
from a pure cosmetics it is their fully
charged a mascara I really enjoyed this
mascara but I know I've had this open
for a very long time and it is a bout
out I can tell I remember the last time
I was wearing this I was like ooh it's
starting to feel like you're pretty much
pretty much out of it and I've had it
open for quite some time so I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter this one but I
really do like this mascara this next
one here is from a sigma beauty and this
is called the sigma pink embellish lash
mascara so it is a pink mascara which i
think is super fun i don't have a ton of
colored mascaras so i do want to keep
this one so i have that option I do like
the embellish lash mascara I think it is
pretty good but I would like to keep
some colored mascaras on hands I'm going
to keep this one I also do have a mini
of the pure fully charged mascara and
this one is a bit newer to me I don't
think I've actually opened this one yet
so i mean i just opened the other one so
you could see it but mascara is kind of
that thing like once you open it the
shelf life starts so i try not to open
mascaras until i'm going to use them but
i'm going to go ahead and keep the sun
since it i know it's a new guy
the full-size so I'm gonna keep the mini
this one is a newer mascara this is from
urban decay it's the troublemaker
mascara I just didn't really love this
one which had me bummed out I did
receive this in PR from Urban Decay but
I just didn't feel like it did a lot for
me I think I tried it in a first
impression type of video and I was like
it's okay it didn't do anything like
life-changing for me and it just was
like kind of mediocre for me I mean
because I'm someone who has the tiny
lashes like I need mascara that's really
gonna make a difference and this one
really didn't for me so I think I'm
gonna actually go ahead and declutter
this one this one is from number 7 it's
the lash impact ultra instant false lash
of volume mascara I mean a plus on the
packaging it's super cute it reminds me
of like a champagne bottle or something
I really like number seven I actually
didn't really love this one I didn't
think it gave me false lash volume or
really much of it anything at all so I
was pretty pumped out about that one I
used this one several times because I
really wanted to make it work because I
love number seven but I'm gonna go ahead
and declutter this one next up but this
one is from a flower beauty and this one
is called their zoom-in ultimate mascara
okay so this one was sent to me in PR
from flower beauty I actually did a one
brand makeup tutorial with them a while
back and holy buckets I love this
mascara it is so good so it's actually
really interesting because it has a
little turn like dial thing right here
and you can actually change the shape of
the wand so it has three different
shapes and you can change it for length
a for volume and then for curl this is
one mascara that I reach for so often
this one comes traveling with me it's
definitely just one of my favorite
mascaras I would highly recommend this
one I think you can still find flower
Beauty at Walmart I'll leave their
website listed down below as well this
is a really really good affordable
mascara so next up I have the Maybelline
lash sensational full fan effect mascara
this is one of like my ogia favorite
mascaras I've repurchased this one as
several times but this one I know has
been open for a very long time and it's
pretty much getting down there as well
so I do need to just go ahead and toss
this one and if
I didn't have as many mascaras as I do
in my collection I would repurchase this
one I think this is a great option from
the drugstore if you're looking for a
really nice affordable mascara I highly
recommend the Maybelline lash
sensational I repurchase this several
times over when I was first starting my
makeup collection one of my favorites
but it does need to be tossed have
another mini guy here from Smashbox this
is the x-rated mascara I know this one
has been open for a while too but man do
I really like this mascara I know that I
need to go ahead and toss it but this is
a good one and now that I'm seeing it I
kind of want to repurchase it again
because it makes my lashes so long it
doesn't do a ton for volume but honestly
it makes them so long that I kind of
just don't even care this is a really
nice mascara if you're someone who
enjoys you know the more higher-end
mascaras and you're looking for a good
one I would check out the smashbox
x-rated i know it needs to be tossed
because it's been open for so long but
this this was a good one so this one
right here is the pur triple threat
mascara and if memory is serving me
correctly I don't think I have opened
this mini guy yet so I don't want to I
want to keep holding on to it because I
do want to try it but I think I'm saying
that correctly and that I haven't opened
at this one yet from here so I'm going
to hang on to it if anyone has tried the
triple threat let me know but I'm gonna
keep this one so I can try it out so
next up I have the L'Oreal voluminous a
lash paradise mascara this mascara was
getting Airy tone of live on YouTube
when it first released a lot of people
compare it to the Too Faced better than
sex mascara I would to the wands are
similar the result is similar but also I
believe that this one flakes just like
the Too Faced better than sex one does I
actually don't think that this one
flakes as much I know that I have a few
more uses out of it and I just wanted it
a couple months ago so it wouldn't need
to be tossed yet I'm gonna keep it until
I do run out of it because I think it's
a nice mascara but I wouldn't repurchase
this one alright so next up we have the
shock from a YSL oh man I remember
Rachel love's just going on and on about
this mascara and I ended up I was going
to purchased it I had it on my loves
list from Sephora for the longest time
and then the mini size I came available
as a 100-point perk so I snatched it up
this is a freaking bomb mascara like
rachel loves was not joking around when
she said the shock was awesome
I would highly recommend this mascara if
you see it as a point perk I would get
it or if you're just someone who likes
to invest in their mascaras highly
recommend why I sell the shot I'll be
keeping this one I know I can still have
a few more uses out of it and I haven't
had it for too long so I will use this
until I can't use it no more next up I
have another embellished lash from Sigma
this one is another colored one this is
in green which is called a bang out so
again I do want to keep this one because
I don't have a lot of coloured options
for mascaras and I actually really do
like this green because it's dark enough
that you can't really tell I mean you
know it's not like the pain cords like
super bright and colorful but it's not
black it's not brown it just gives
something a little bit different and
like I said I do like the embellish lash
like style of wand and all of that but I
would like to keep it to have another
colored option this next one here is
from Pierre it's called the big look
mascara this mascara really surprised me
sometimes mascaras just don't really get
me going like they can some other people
and I think it's because I'm such a
false lash lover but this mascara
actually made it into a favorites video
of mine once and that's saying a lot
when I put a mascara into a favorites
video because I just don't find that to
happen for me a lot this is a really
nice mascara I would highly recommend it
I think it does a lot not only in length
abundant volume too
I highly recommend I'll be keeping this
one until I use it all up next up I have
a mini here of the man-eater mascara
from Tarte cosmetics I just got this in
a set from Tarte that I picked up it
pretty recently from Ulta and it had
like false lashes in it this mascara I
think maybe it had an eyeliner I can't
quite I'll remember what it had in there
but this was in there so I've only tried
this out two times so far so far I think
it's pretty good but I definitely need
to keep giving it more tries so I can
actually get a review together on it so
I am going to hang on to this one
this next mascara is from Burberry it's
called the cat eye lashes mascara I'm
not going to open it up because it has
not been opened yet so I want to wait
until I give it a try
this well sent to the MPR from Burberry
with a couple other items that I need to
test out so I will be holding onto this
one next up I have this one from Lancome
this is an Hypnose a drama and I am like
racking my brain but I cannot think of
where I got this one I don't think I got
it sent to me in PR I don't think I
requested it from actally but I'm like
did I buy this myself I honestly cannot
remember but I'm
know that I tried out a mini of the
Lancome Hypnose drama and I absolutely
loved it so I actually kind of think
that I probably did purchase this myself
I have not opened it yet though because
I actually just a couple months ago
before I was really doing two clutters I
got rid of that mini from the Hypnose
drama so I was waiting to open this
until I declared that one which I have
so I'm not gonna open it yet since I
haven't opened it yet but this is a
really nice mascara as well definitely
keeping this one so next up I have this
one from julep it is called with a twist
it's the lash boosting bamboo
mascara this was sent to me from Priya
nice something similar to like the
Influenster are actually where you get
items to review this I was really
impressed with as well it does kind of
remind me of the flower beauty because
you can twist the wand to give it
different shape and once again I really
do like this mascara I reach for this
one quite a bit as well I'm julep it can
be found at Ulta so if you're looking
for you know a good one maybe similar to
the flower beauty but you want it to be
a little bit more accessible I'll link
this one to altar down below but this
one also very much impressed me so I'm
gonna keep this one then finally the
last mascara I have is the roller lash
afferent benefit I have repurchased this
mascara many times over it's a one of my
favorites I know I've had this one open
for a very long time though it would
need to be declutter and it's just about
empty every time I use it I do have to
like continually dip back in because it
is about gone so I'm gonna go ahead and
do color at this one but again this is a
really good mascara I know even though I
have quite a few mascaras and I kept
quite a few I can totally see myself
repurchasing this one okay so these are
my two piles the top one up here is my
heat pile and I'm keeping a 14 and this
down here is my declutter pile and I'm
declaring eight I honestly didn't do as
well as I thought I was going to I
thought honestly I was going in to
declutter morth and I kept those okay we
still got a handful declutter so I'm
happy about that that is going to it for
my mascara declutter and then let's go
ahead and move over to my eyeliners okay
so this is what my eyeliner collection
looks like so far so I have a couple
loose ones and those are mostly new
eyeliners to me eyeliners and I'm still
trying out and then I have quite a few
in this little guy as well so first
we'll just go ahead and go
kind of a newer pile because I am going
to be keeping most of these because I'm
testing them out and all of that but
these ones here are from Maybelline they
recently sent me their metallic master
precise ink metallic liquid eyeliners so
there's quite a few colors in here that
they sent to me and I'm still going
through and testing them out I did use
and goes this purple one in a trying new
drugstore makeup and I haven't been able
to try them out as quickly as I would
like to because I don't go for like the
super metallic looks super often so it's
not like I'm constantly reaching for
these to try them out but I know that I
don't have to keep all of the shades so
I know that I used of the purple and I
used the yellow I've used the green I
know I've used this one so I've used
quite a bit so there's that ace 3 I know
are ones that I haven't used so I'm
gonna go ahead and put these in my past
I'll I can put them into a giveaway or
send them along to friends or family
because I didn't use is that all these
haven't gone on my eyes they haven't
been washed or anything so these are
okay to pass along so I'm going to
divide up the section like that of the
maybelline liners next up but these are
all of the heavy metal glitter liners
from Urban Decay so this one here in
Midnight Cowboy actually just mentioned
this in my flashback Friday 2016 Sephora
vib sale haul because that's when I got
this one here and I really do love it
and then Urban Decay actually sent me
their whole arrests of their line of
glitters which was super exciting and to
receive something like this in PR I have
been going through these and testing
them and there are just so many colors
that I absolutely love like I haven't
found one yet that I don't like I know
it came with Midnight Cowboy and that
one is in my holiday giveaway video
since obviously I have it I know I've
sent one to a friend and I have another
one put aside for someone for Christmas
gonna say who in case she's watching so
I do have a few from the collection that
I have already passed along but there
are a few in here that seem really
similar to me like these ones right here
which is punk rock and then sticks and
bones I have used punk rock so I'll keep
that one and then I'll put this one in
my past pile and then also these two
right here are pretty similar to me so
we have gamma-ray
and then spandex i have used spandex oh
I'm gonna keep this one and I'll put
this one in my past pile and then the
other ones I am going to hold on to I've
used most of them out of this little
collection right here but I'm gonna hold
on to these these are just some of my
favorites I highly recommend that these
glitters from Urban Decay these are some
newer liners that to me this one is from
love rock
it's called front-of-the-line pro
eyeliner I think it came with one of the
eyeshadow palettes I do really like this
one actually so I am going to keep this
one and then also the Kat Von D tattoo
liner this was a 100-point perk at
Sephora and I really liked this liner
since I got it I was like why have I not
repurchase this liner sooner because I
had purchased it in a full-size
previously and then ran out of it but I
really enjoyed this one not so I'm going
to go ahead and keep it and then this
one is from ELF this is just called
their jet black liner I don't know if it
has a name but is more of a liquid liner
and I just have not really been able to
get on with this one I've tried it a
couple times and I just feel like I'm
not doing a very good job with it so I'm
gonna go ahead and declutter this one
alrighty so next up we have everything
that is in that this little drawer here
okay so this one is from benefit it's
the they're real push-up liner and I
just cannot cannot to get on with this
liner you would see their like you would
think that's the liner but it's not you
actually have to like click the bottom
and then product is supposed to come out
of here I have a hard time getting the
product out it breaks really easily this
is just a product that I have never
really been able to get on with I'm just
gonna go ahead and toss this so next up
this is from a thrive at cosmetics and
this is called their infinity waterproof
eyeliner in Nally
unfortunately this one didn't really
work out for me either it is a brown
liner and I've tried a couple other
items from Dr cosmetics I especially
love their eyebrow pencil but this one I
just didn't feel like did anything it is
kind of scratchy on the waterline and
not super pigmented so I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter this one next up I
have an eyeliner here from unique this
is the moodstruck precision a liquid
eyeliner I had a friend who sold unique
around the same time that I was starting
my Beauty side of YouTube and so she
sent me a few products but I really
didn't like it and I've had this for
quite some time because that was like 2
years ago so I know I'm just gonna go
ahead and declare
this one was not a favorite so next up
this is an eyeliner from a deck of
scarlet I did receive a deck of scarlet
in @pr a couple months ago and I was not
very impressed with the eyeliner I think
or the lip pencil the only items that
actually impressed me from the deck of
scarlet was actually like eyeshadows and
like blush and highlight this one was
not very good again just kind of
scratching on the waterline and not
pigmented so I'm gonna go home and
declutter this one stuff this is the NYC
liquid eyeliner everybody raved about
this on YouTube this was definitely a
YouTube made me buy it I went all the
way from one of my Walmart's to finally
find this one even though I don't really
shop at Walmart very much but I went
trying to find it and I just could not
make this work for me I'm not very good
with eyeliners with this style of
applicator it just does not really work
out for me I have the toughest time at
trying to make this work honestly I've
had it for a really long time I know it
would just need to be declutter but
seriously like I didn't really like it
anyways so this next one here is from
gorgeous at cosmetics it's just called
their eye line eyeliner pen this was
sent to me in PR it was okay I like the
style of applicator much better but I
didn't think it was all that pigmented
and it kind of like would fade pretty
quickly when I did liquid liner with it
so not my favorite I know I have quite a
few other liner so I'll be keeping so
I'm gonna declutter this one next one is
from la belladonna and this is just
called their liquid eyeliner I did get
sent some PR from La Bella Donna
unfortunately pretty much nothing worked
for me from that brand which I was super
disappointed and it's a pretty pricey
brand but I just couldn't really get on
with anything eyeliner is not pigmented
at all you had to go over it several
times for it to show up so I'm gonna go
ahead and declare this one so next time
I have this one from ELF this is their
liquid eyeliner it's in brown and
similar to the other one that I showed
on the same style of applicator and it's
okay but it's just not a favorite again
similar to what I was saying with the
black eyeliner so I'm gonna go ahead and
declare this one too because here I have
this one from DHC this is the liquid
eyeliner I was sent this and a campaign
again with preen dot me and this became
one of my absolute favorite eyeliners
this is my second one actually and I
just love this I highly recommend it
when people ask me what I do for my
liner I am typically always recommending
DHC you can find these on their website
you can also find them on Amazon I'll
have it linked down below one of my
favorite liners I do not want to not
have this in my collection
except I have this one from it's called
model launcher felt tip liner and
Emerald Isle I'm actually not really
familiar about this one I'm assuming I
probably got it in like an Ipsy bag or
something similar like that it still has
all the plastic on it so mmm I'm
actually I think I'm just gonna put this
into a giveaway pile because I have so
many other eyeliners I'm not familiar
with the brand myself so I'm just gonna
go ahead and put this in the giveaway
pile because I know my keep pile right
now is pretty large we are almost done
sunlights doing some funny things let's
keep it rolling okay this next one here
is from Sigma this is their power liner
also in Sigma pink just like the mascara
I really do like this eyeliner I think
it's really cool I used it on my
waterline as several times I definitely
wanna keep this one this next one is
from Aiko it's their Aiko fact a liquid
eyeliner and I just can't really get on
with this I did try it a couple
different times I think I got this sent
to me in like an Ipsy bag or something
and I don't know the applicator just
didn't really work out for me cuz I
don't do really thick liner looks a lot
so I'm gonna go ahead and declare this
one except this one is from Rimmel this
is their exaggerated liner in in the
nude you guys have probably seen me use
this a lot in my tutorials I feel like
I'm constantly using this one as a
really pretty like nude beige liner and
the waterline to help open up the eyes I
definitely have to keep this one next up
I have this one from NYX this is their
collection at Noir a liquid eyeliner I
bought this because I saw a lot of
people recommending it and it's okay I
think I'm gonna go ahead and declutter
this one again it just has that
applicator that I'm not the best at
using I just can never really seem to
get it right like the days I get it
right it looks great but the majority of
time I don't get it right and it looks
really bad so I'm gonna go ahead and
declare this one next up I have one of
the Marc Jacob highlighter pens that
this one I believe is an overt which is
a green and I absolutely love it I love
the Marc Jacob highliners I want them
all definitely have to keep this one
it's such a gorgeous
all right I also have the Maybelline
master graphic eyeliner this one is
similar to the ICO one and I cannot ever
get this plastic off like when you pull
the cap off the plastic doesn't come off
which is fine because this one is going
to be declared again I just couldn't
really get a hang because it has such a
thick applicator wasn't really ever my
favorite so I'm gonna declutter this one
this next one is from Pierre it's
they're on point a liner in the shade is
down-to-earth it's a beautiful Brown
again I use this one like almost on a
daily basis this is definitely my
favorite Brown eyeliner I think it's
gorgeous I love that when you put it in
it automatically sharpens it for you so
this is always always sharp oh it's on
point like the name says one of my
favorite eyeliners I highly recommend
these will behaving this next up I have
the TARDIS a double-take liner this one
I have a pretty love-hate relationship
with and once I do have the regular
eyeliner side which i think is fantastic
one of my favorite waterline pencils on
that side and then on this side you have
a more felt tip style of pen for liquid
liner I can only make giant wings with
this liner I'm going to keep it because
I love the regular liner side I think
it's fantastic but when I want those
really big wings like huge dramatic I'm
gonna fly away
I reach for this pencil again only thing
I can use it for so if you love making
big wings check out the TARDIS double
take I'm gonna keep it but it's
definitely a one that I have that
love-hate relationship with next up I
have this one from Maybelline this is
the master precise eyeliner this is
probably like my fourth or fifth
eyeliner I've gone through a lot of
these you see has that really sharp tip
there I absolutely loved this to learn
how to do winged liner it's pretty
affordable because it is by Maybelline
and this is what I really learned how to
do winged liner on once I finally got
the hang of it I realized that there was
other liners that I liked more and for
this one for me it just isn't like black
enough or matte enough and I'd find
myself having to go over the eyeliner
quite a bit but to learn on this is it
this is it right here so this mascara
will always have a special place in my
heart but this one is basically used up
anyways I would just need to declutter
it and like I said I don't reach for
this one as much anymore but if you're
new you don't want to spend a lot of
money on a liquid liner when you're
trying
learn I suggest this one from Maybelline
next up I have another one from
Maybelline this is their master precise
skinny gel pencil and I have mine in the
shade brown so it's a really really like
fine tip tiny little little eye liner I
am going to go ahead and keep this one I
do like it for the waterline I think
it's pretty good it's not my favorite
but I do still like it I like the pier
one more but I know I still have quite a
few uses out of it so I'm going to keep
this one next up I have this one from
colour-pop I love the color pub creme
gel liners highly recommend these
they're like five dollars they have a
ton of different colors they're super
affordable they stay in the waterline
all day and they're just pretty bomb so
this one is a gorgeous green I think
it's so pretty
definitely want to keep this fun but
really can't say enough good things
about the color pop ones in general and
this one is called a maybe another one
that I have from colour-pop this one is
in collaboration with a kathleenlights
and this one is called mr. bang and this
is more of a regular brown liner I
actually have used this one as so often
and it used to be one of my absolute
favorites and I don't know I don't know
if it's just something funky with this
eye liner but it's like as I use it more
I don't feel like it's as good
especially compared with the other kind
of problems that I have and I know I've
kept a few other brown liners so I think
I'm gonna go ahead and declutter this
one I don't know it's kind of weird I
don't feel like any of my other color
pop liners did that where they kind of
got worse over time but for some reason
mr. Bing did for me so I'm gonna put
this in the past pile this next one is
from urban decay it's one of the 24/7
glide-on eye pencils this one is in deep
end and it's a beautiful teal I was just
wearing this one in my least favorite
makeup products of 2017 I believe it was
this is what I had in the waterline I
love having really fun colorful
eyeliners for when I want more of a
simple book but a really fun pop of
color on the waterline this one is so
good this is the first 24/7 glide on eye
pencil I tried from Urban Decay and I
was so impressed definitely keeping this
one next up I have this one from Milani
this is called the stay-put matte a
liquid liner and it's kind of a cool
forest green but again it has that
applicator that I just am NOT the best
at and this one is actually kind of
thick I don't know if you can tell
because the Sun is so weird but it is
kind of thick and you can't get any sort
of like precise line with it I liked the
color but the application is too hard
for me so I'm going to declutter this
one I have another highlighter here from
mark Jacobson is an orange outburst and
again I love these highlighters I would
have every color if I could afford them
because they are pretty pricey got to
keep this one this is another one from
colour-pop this one is in best oh it's
kind of like a cool burgundy it's way
pushed up I don't know how well he'll be
able to see the color there but again I
really like this one even though I've
had it for a while I still think it's
performing really well so I'm going to
keep this one got another highlighter
from Marc Jacobs this one is an odyssey
again it's a really beautiful kind of
teal blue reminds me a bit of the urban
decay one but again love these I've used
this one so often got to keep this one
want them all so what I have here is
another one from colour-pop this one is
in a crybaby it's a beautiful like
pastel lavender color and I'm surprised
that this one has not done for because I
use this one so much I love putting a
lighter shade in the waterline to kind
of open up the eyes a bit and when I
don't want to do more of a nude beige
this kind of like lavender tint to it is
so gorgeous so I'm going to keep this
one too already so that is it for my
eyeliner declutter so this one is my key
pile and I capped at 28 and then this
one is my declutter pile and I
decluttered 21 so really not too bad for
the eyeliners that was fairly evenly
matched there and I'm pretty happy with
all of my selections so that is going to
do it though for my mascara and my
eyeliner collection declutter I hope
that you guys enjoyed seeing this video
and seeing a new declutter I know I need
to get back on track I have that eye
shadow palette collection declutter
looming here that I need to get done and
that's going to be a sad day but that
one will be coming up too along with
like it concealers and a few other items
