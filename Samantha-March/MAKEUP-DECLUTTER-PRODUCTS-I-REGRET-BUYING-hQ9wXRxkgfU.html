so I'm very excited for today's video
because it's going to be the first of
its kind is going to be a be cluttering
of my makeup collection so this is gonna
be either products that I just like
don't really use a lot products that are
just old and like needs to be thrown
away
or products that I bought and I just did
not love so it's gonna be kind of like a
declutter plus like almost like products
I regret buying because a couple of
these that I have to talk about I'm like
me and I wish I would have bought
something else instead of that you know
what I mean but so yeah this is gonna be
the first time that I'm doing something
like this I have makeup I think I have
some nail polishes and even some like
hair care items I just kind of went
through everything I'm just gonna show
it to you one by one it's not gonna be
like a declutter where I'm literally
like going through my drawers I'm
pulling things out because my makeup
collection right now is just in my
bathroom I don't have a Beauty room and
there's like no lighting in my bathroom
so filming in there with just not to be
an option basically I have this bag full
of stuff thank you to author Lindsay
calc I think your name is on here are
you here Lindsey sent me her latest book
and it came with this tote bag and it
was sitting in my office and I'm like
I'm gonna put that tote bag to good use
so I did so I have kind of a lot of
stuff I'm kind of sad this was really
hard to do I'm definitely a pack rat I
don't like to get rid of stuff it makes
me sad and even as I was going through
it there's still some products that I
kept that I shouldn't know but maybe
I'll just do another declutter soon but
it's just so hard for me to part with
things even if I never ever ever ever
use them yeah hopefully I'll be able to
do a few more of these as I am you know
growing on YouTube and growing my makeup
collection at the same time I do need to
like keep on top of making sure that I'm
decluttering every once in a while to
make way for new items if you would like
to see what I have decluttered from my
makeup collection please keep watching
like I think I'm just gonna like set it
set in here how about setting it here so
here I need like you need an actual
table I definitely need a new like
filming setup because this is just
so hard to do okay so I discovered a few
products out I'm not gonna go into any
sort of orderly I just gonna reach in
the bag and see what I can find but the
first thing I pulled out is a haircare
item this is from Garnier Fructis it's
their pure clean smoothing cream it says
24-hour frizz control I mean I bought
this sucker like years ago I have not
used a lot of it and like the very first
time I used it I was like nope whenever
I buy things that say that they're frizz
control I pretty much it no it doesn't
work I have very very frizzy hair it has
taken me years to understand how to call
my frizz and what products to work for
it and this was not one of them another
one that I have in here I'm actually
pretty bummed about this was actually
sent to me this is from the perfectly
posh line it's a lip gloss I can get is
I mean yeah it's there candied lip dye
and posh pink so it just looks like that
and it's just a lip balm and I just I
just don't wear these a lot and I'm
bummed because I know the guy who sent
it to me was like I know you like lip
stuff and so she sent it and I tried it
once and I just like really didn't do
anything for me wasn't my favorite and
it's always just been sitting on my desk
like I even leave it on my desk is like
hey when you just need some lip balm put
this on but actually what I really
prefer from perfectly posh that the same
dog sent me is a sugar scrub for my lips
I leave that by my desk and put it on
all the time because it helps especially
because I wear liquid lipsticks so much
and this I've just I literally used it
one time and I feel so bad because I
don't know do I throw it away I don't
know with all these items that I'm going
to talk about I've been I've been
talking about doing this on my snapchat
for a while and a lot of people have
responded back and said like do a
giveaway for the items that you don't
want and I'm like you guys are saying
this before you even see what I'm a bit
cluttering like a lot of these things do
just need to be thrown away they're old
they're almost gone like things like
that I would never even think about
giving them to a friend but some of the
stuff like this like I mean I used it
once but my finger wasn't it so like
that to me seems like weird so I still
don't know what I'm gonna do with this
if I'm gonna like let friends and
family go through it or if I'll do some
sort of giveaway for it I don't even
know if that's like legal or sanitary to
give away makeup items that has already
been used so if anyone knows that answer
please leave it in the comments below
because I really don't want to just
throw away the stuff that actually is
good but I don't want to be like gross
you know and I have is a nail polish
this is from the Victoria's Secret line
it is the shade tantalize I guess this
is what it looks like it's just a like
light purple shade and honestly the
Victoria Secret nail polishes just don't
do anything for me I have another one
that I'm pretty sure is in that bag and
they're just they're very liquidy they
don't go on well they don't stay well
like they're just I just bought him as
an impulse buy one day because they were
up by the register but one item this one
I have is the Rimmel London stay matte
clarifying matte foundation that isn't
what this looks like I was not a huge
fan of this I mean I brought this a
couple years ago as well I wasn't a huge
fan of it but I would use it on days
where like I wasn't really doing my
makeup but I wanted to like kind of look
alive I think it was mostly when me and
my boyfriend moved in together for the
first time and I was like oh gotta make
sure I look okay but I don't want to
look look - okay we're not married and
that does not matter but it's actually
almost gone for something that I didn't
really like very much I used it more
than I thought I would it's it's
literally almost gone it's so old like
this is just getting thrown away
probably gonna be like off-centered in
this entire video because I sit on like
a bar stool that's what I sit on and
half of the bar stool has like the
products that I can easily grab to knife
so I feel like I'm like gonna fall off
the side of the chair just let you know
so another product that I got this is
definitely a product that I regret
purchasing because it was so frickin
expensive but this is the Laura Mercier
it is the secret camouflage concealer or
whatever this is what it looks like on
the inside this I actually bought on a
trip to New York City me my husband were
in New York City I had a book signing
and we went and we were just kind of
walking along in a Sephora popped up and
I was like let's go in and I was like
I'm only
by one thing this was like three years
ago maybe I was like I'm just gonna buy
one thing I was just starting to get
into watching YouTube tutorials and I
watched Carly Bible she was one of the
very first people that I ever ever
watched and she wore this so much and I
was like okay I'm gonna start learning
how to do my makeup because before I
started watching YouTube I am not
kidding you guys I had no idea how to do
makeup I had no idea my makeup
collection was literally like a powder
foundation and a covergirl single eye
shadow and maybe like an eyeliner stick
like I didn't know what I was doing I
didn't know how to do makeup I would
always ask my friends who knew how to do
makeup like whenever we were going out
somewhere like in college I was always
asking people to do my makeup because I
loved it so much I just didn't
understand it and so watching YouTube
like like you see my winged liner today
I was so proud of myself like every time
I do my makeup like that's how I'm like
I learned that from you too legit from
YouTube and being passionate about
something and be willing to put in the
time to like learn how to do it that's
what it is
but anyways part of my spiel but Carli
bybel was always using this secret
camouflage what is secret tells us
secret camouflage concealer I don't know
and it just did not work for me it was
so so drying under the eyes like I put
it on for the first time and then
Carly's tutorials like she would put it
on under other eyes and just buff it out
and it would be fine and I was like I
felt like I was scraping my eyes and I
was like maybe I'm not putting on enough
product so then I would put on even more
product and try to oh my it was horrible
I don't like this I tried so many times
to make it work it did not work very
expensive product super bummed about it
a foundation that I have is from L'Oreal
it's their magic nude a liquid powder it
came in this little like glass bottle
and this I don't know I can you guys see
that like it is very very liquidy it
does say to shake well before you use
which I did and I still don't think it
did anything it went on my face like so
so streaky and it would be so hard to
make my face like look normal when using
this and literally they're like the line
is right here and I bought this I know I
bought this when I were
at the hospital and I haven't been at
the hospital for three years and I
started working from home probably five
or six years ago so I mean that's a long
time ago that I bought this and that was
how much I used but this was even
something that I found it and I was like
shouldn't I give it away or should I
give it another chance no give it away
um this is from eiko it's a fat eye
stick
I have no idea where I got this my guess
is like maybe in like a makeup kit that
someone bought for me as a gift one time
and I just don't find myself reaching
for it a lot I've tried to use it a few
times as like good an eyelid base but
the gray is just like so opaque like it
just it doesn't really work I don't
reach for it at all so it just needs to
be thrown away
this was another recommendation from
Carli bybel and in her video like when I
first started watching YouTube videos I
was the person that was like whatever
was hot I or whatever it not even hot
but like whatever people would just talk
about a lot I went out and bought it
like no questions asked and you know now
I'm much more smarter than that like I
take my time I realized what I actually
need in my collection what actually
works for me and what won't continue to
break my bank account you know all those
sort of good things in one of her videos
she recommended the Revlon Photoready
skin lights and in her video she had two
different ones that she talked about so
what did I do
I went out I bought both of them oh I
did not need to buy both of them and I
barely use them I don't like them I
don't really think they work they're
supposed to be in a face illuminator
sometimes what I'll do with these if I
want a little bit of highlight but
nothing like crazy like I don't want to
wear my bag highlighters or something
like that I'll put this one on otherwise
I'll use it as a base I really like to
use a base with the mary-lou manizer I
just think it makes it pop so much more
but a lot of times I use the Watts up
from benefit and I love it
I very hardly reach for these but I was
like you know sometimes I still do but I
don't need to so I don't even know what
shade this is in oh this is in peach
light I think the other one I have is
like rose something so peach light don't
need this is definitely a product that I
read
this is like so far up on the product I
regret buying because I remember buying
this and it was like nearly a forty
dollar eyeshadow and I was so excited
and I remember being like proud of
myself that I like was able to budget
for and be able to buy a single
eyeshadow for forty dollars that was so
stupid
but it is the Stila magnificent metals
foil finish eyeshadow it came in this
little box and I was seeing people talk
about it the shade I got was metallic
rose quartz of seeing people talk about
it and honestly I probably saw like two
people talk about it and then I went out
and bought it and then as I watch more
people talk about it so many people were
like it's so hard to work with like now
that and I'm like I should have just
waited and watched a few more videos but
it comes in this little guy and it also
comes with a little tan right here
actually I might keep this I might be
able to like use this for foundation you
know how some people will like mix
foundations and stuff in little pans I
might keep that part but it actually
also came with a little dropper of
liquid and I use that up like I used
that to my gel eyeliners that were
drying out and just other things that I
wanted to use liquid for I use that up
but this I used solid two times this is
what it looks like in the pan and
basically I would like take a toothpick
picks them out put the liquid on this
little thing mix it up and put it on my
eyes super hard to use but it came out
so so clumpy like I would start to put
it on my eye and I'd have it like in my
inner corner and then I'd go to try to
spread it throughout my eye and it would
just stay there and I'm like okay and
then I would try it again and I'd put
like a clump over here on this side and
then try to blend it in and I just have
a clump so like literally I'm so clumpy
it looked ridiculous
I oh this I did not like this so much
and I started watching videos and seeing
how other people did it and so many
people just kept saying the same thing
these are so hard to work with so hard
to work with it was like $36 or
something like that for this eyeshadow
and I was so unimpressed with it and so
unhappy with it
and I really I don't even want anywhere
else
as I just want to throw it away because
it made me still mad a bunch of lip
products here and oh let's see one is a
lipstick this is from Estee Lauder one
of my old friends used to work for us to
I let her and I would like go like she
would do makeup there so of course I was
always like girl what are you doing so I
have like I don't know a bunch of us a
lot our stuff but this lipstick like not
only doesn't that just look like it's in
super rough condition but I never wear
it it actually this like sounds really
weird but I feel like it broke my lips
out because every time I would wear it I
would get like little breakouts right
around my lips or even like on my lips
and they were super super painful so why
I even held onto this baby I have no
idea but it needs to get thrown away
it's it's in bad shape from Neutrogena I
have a moisture smooth color stick just
looks like this this is like something I
bought when I first was like I need to
start building up my lip collection and
it just really doesn't do anything for
me it's very very sheer but it's kind of
like sticky and yeah it makes my lips
kind of smooth but I just I never ever
reach for this ever from Revlon I have
two of their colorburst matte balms and
this again was when I was like building
my collection one is in elusive and one
is in complex I think that's not worse
so one is like a pink and one is like a
nude I actually did wear these quite a
bit when I did buy them I actually
really like to wear them together
because the pink was a lot like brighter
pink than I think I realized and then I
would put the nude over it and it would
look really pretty and I actually I put
this in my declutter bag first and I was
like I'll hold onto the nude because I
did like to wear it to like new things
out or sheer things out but I have other
lipsticks now that can do that for me
that I grab for a lot more so I don't
need these these weren't even like in my
little like lipstick collection over
here or I have a couple jars have
lipstick on my desk too they weren't
even in those they were like tucked away
in a drawer so these can go and then
another lip I have is so worn out I can
barely see what this says I think it's
color yeah covergirl lip slicks in QT
this is what the package looks like I
have no recollection of buying this I
don't know
where it came from I don't know how old
it is this is what it looks like I never
ever wear it it can just go that one
from covergirl that I have when I told
you guys like in my very old makeup
collection I had like one covergirl
eyeshadow this is the one that I'm
talking about this is from covergirl of
the shade it's an eye enhancer I don't
know what shade this is Sombra maybe
that sounds kind of weird but it was
just the single eyeshadow it came with
its own little brush and that's what the
shadow will look like I mean you guys
can tell like I used that sucker a lot
and I did but this is like legit what I
would use and one thing that I would do
is I would put this all over my lids and
then I would use a blue eyeliner from
maybelline I still use it it's always
having collection it's one of my
favorite eyeliners but it was a deep
blue and I would put that on as an
eyeliner and then like throughout the
night it would almost kind of like
transfer and like do cool things to the
color so weird but like literally that's
how it is my makeup before I learned how
to do my makeup but this guy I just
never use anymore because I don't need
to I have so many other eyeshadows that
I love so much and like I wanted to hold
onto it for like nostalgia purposes but
I'm like get over yourself
like throw it away so old the other nail
polish I have from Victoria's Secret is
here it was this like a really nudey
pink it was called flirt away this like
barely even showed up on my nails I
really like light pink colors on my
nails but this one was just like other
haircare product I have is from Trezza
May this is their anti frizz secret
smoothing cream like I told you guys
usually things that say anti frizz just
do not work Kim oh I hate snoozing with
eyelashes okay yeah I actually got sent
or no it wasn't from Tresemme it was
from John Frieda I remember one time I
think the packaging looks similar that's
why I thought of it John Frieda sent me
like a whole like anti frizz thing to
review and I just
hated it so much I reviewed it probably
on Chiclets Plus and Amazon and I was
just like don't even don't even waste
your time or money cuz I remember I was
like such a process that you had to go
through to like use all the products is
ridiculous but anyways that has nothing
to do with this video but this one from
Tresemme I mean they're still like so
much in it but it just it does nothing
this product I can't even tell you what
it is it's just this like purple stick
it has no writing on it it has no
anything I don't know who it's from
where it's from what it is what it's
supposed to be that's what the product
looks like it's disgusting and old
sometimes I try to use it like with the
other like fat eye stick or whatever
that was as like a eyelid primer but
this is this is so gross so this is a
product that I regret purchasing and it
makes me really sad because it is from a
brand that I absolutely love I rave
about I just I love their product so
much I own so much from them I continue
to buy for them but I think they had a
dud when they came up with this product
and it is the color pop gel liner and it
is the gel liner in the pot form now
when they came out with their cream gel
liners they came out with ones in the
platform and they also came out with
ones in a pencil form the pencil form is
a bomb I think I own like four or five
different shades and the pencils they
are fantastic highly suggest you get
them the ones in the pop form I suggest
you run away the shade that I got is in
get paid and it's a really pretty
metallic rose gold shade unfortunately
the ones in the pot are just like very
drying they're super hard to get out
like what's my finger with a brush like
it was just super hard to get the
product out it's not easy to blend like
even taking a brush and trying to make a
wing with it was impossible I felt like
I was gonna make my eyelids bleed it
stung my eyes and irritated my eyes
almost immediately after I put it on I
did not like it now
I also purchased get paid in a in a
different order from this one I
purchased get paid in the liner form and
it is fantastic it's smooth its creamy
it goes on
shows up it doesn't irritate my eyes
it's fantastic so again the cream gel
liners from colour-pop in the pop form I
say no no in the liner form get them all
I have to talk about our all like
palettes and it kind of made me sad to
put these in my decluttering bag but I
did it because I don't reach for them
they're actually often the same company
as well so I don't want it to come off
as like I'm bashing this company but
I'll kind of explain as I go through it
but the first thing I have is from BH
Cosmetics it is their malibu palette so
this is what this looks like it's just a
really cute like small it was a special
edition palette I actually think I got
this for free in an order that I
purchased with BH Cosmetics oh my god I
like cannot open these
I have nails on today so I like
basically can't use my hands okay that
right no it's magnetic and I started to
open to the clothes okay so when you
open it up this is what it looks like
you have all these like crazy cool
shades and then there's actually a
middle part here too and it has like two
blushes a highlighter and a bronzer I
think but like two of those products are
broken and if I open it it'll go
everywhere so I do just need to throw
this away because it's broken I mean
unless people would want to use these
eyeshadows I don't know I don't know but
I never reach for it I don't really use
a lot of these like wild colors in here
anyways I held on to it like just in
case I ever got crazy but I just don't
reach for it oh the other two are our
shadow palettes that I have from BH
Cosmetics like literally you can see the
dust on these yeah but one is the BH
party girl palette it has 40 eyeshadows
and one is the BH day and night palette
and it has 60 eyeshadows now when I
first got into makeup ones I decided to
make the decision to learn how to do
makeup and be able to have like a decent
makeup collection one of the first
companies that I ordered from is BH
Cosmetics a lot of youtubers talks about
BH Cosmetics and it is just very
affordable like they are nice quality
but very affordable as a beginner this
was fantastic
like I'm not saying anything bad about
BH Cosmetics please understand that as a
beginner this is what I needed I needed
to buy affordable products that still
worked good enough to help me understand
what it was I was doing as a beginner I
shouldn't have gone out and bought
anasazi about really hello I shadow you
know things that are going to like break
my bank and I'm not gonna understand
what I'm doing and just to be able to
play around and get the feel of how to
do makeup you don't want to start on a
product that is so expensive like these
were the perfect perfect palettes for me
to start out with add a beginner so just
want to make sure that like I'm clear
saying that and I still like BH
Cosmetics I still purchase from them and
I think they are getting like butter and
butter I have heard the Carli bybel
palette that she did with them I've
heard it's fantastic I tried to get it
when it first came out and it kept being
sold out and then I just kind of got
frustrated and didn't get it but it's
still on my wish list it's something
that I still really really want to have
in my collection but again it's like
just want to say that but actually one
of these is broken okay it's not this
one so this one is the party girl
palette and it has like all of these
crazy shades I have no idea as I've been
framed or not but it has like it has
really like a huge variety of shades I
mean there's 40 colors in here there's
mattes they're shimmers that are stark
there's lights their transitions there's
white there's crazy pops of color like
there's so much in here
I used this palette so much when I was
first turning out the bad thing about
the BH Cosmetics pellets is that they
are very very powdery at least this one
is and the other one that I have they're
very very powdery shadows and they
aren't very pigmented so when I was
using them it really did help me
understand what I was doing get a feel
for what I was doing my makeup looks
weren't turning out very well I said
very very good for beginners very very
affordable but just not something that I
reach for anymore now that I have more
people it's Kat Von D's makeup geek
shadows you know that sort of thing I
don't need these like beginner palettes
for me anymore
one was the day and night palette and
this one is actually pretty broken like
can you guys tell like it's it's broken
these shadows are gone there's like I
shadow everywhere
one day I dropped two palettes the other
one I have to show
as well is just like broken but I
remember them dropping and getting very
sad about it but this one in particular
I was kind of like oh well because I
don't use it a lot and when I first
bought these pallets I really didn't
need to buy the two of them together
like I didn't need a sixty shadow
palette and a forty shadow palette I
just didn't need that many eyeshadows
but so when this one broke I was just
kind of like oh well for some reason I
kept it I have no idea why a lot of
shadows are broken I don't even like to
open it because shadows fall out
everywhere like I do just need to get
rid of this one the other one I think
I'm gonna actually see if my niece wants
it my niece is she's 16 and she's like
getting it to makeup which i think is
really exciting and like fun for me like
something that we can bond over but her
birthday's coming up so I might see if
she wants some of these items that I'm
giving away especially something like
the BH palette like something to learn
on but I don't know if she doesn't wanna
I'll figure out something else to do
with it but this one just yeah this one
just needs to be thrown away the last
one I have the last one this is this is
the end this is the end of my
decluttering but it was a contour and
blush palette from BH Cosmetics it has
six different shades in here and I'm
super bummed because this one broke and
this is how I learned to like contour I
was actually very very impressed with
this palette the only reason that I'm
declaring it is because it's it's broken
if you guys can see my in-frame can I
tell like it's just it's super broken
but I was very bummed because before I
started getting more into contouring and
highlighting and you know all that good
stuff like this is what I learned on and
it was such a good thing to learn on and
I think now BH has like a lot more
contouring like choices this was such a
good thing for me to start with
it had like it had like the blush shades
that have the contour shades it had the
setting shades it had highlighter shades
like I just thought it was really good
it was something so great for me to
learn on I was really bummed too that
this is the color that broke because
that was the color that I used a lot but
the blushes were very good and I thought
about like seeing if I could just like
make it work but honestly I have so many
other like blushes and now contour
shades and bronzers
setting powders and things like that in
my collection that I just don't need it
anymore so for something that's so
broken like I just need to say goodbye
to it but it was a really good option
especially again as I think as a
beginner so BH Cosmetics is definitely a
brand that I suggest checking out again
you know you don't only have to be a
beginner to buy from BH Cosmetics but
even they have great brushes I bought
two brush sets from BH Cosmetics and if
you guys watched my makeup tutorials I'm
using those brushes all the time but I'm
always saying like these came in a set
these came in a set because I bought the
sets and they helped me so so much
before I could be able to afford more
expensive brushes it was such a good
option for me and I still will buy those
brushes I think they're great and yeah I
just don't want to make it seem like I
was like bashing a brand because that's
totally not what I'm doing so even
though I'm declaring a lot from them you
know two of the products are broken when
I just don't use anymore so just to keep
that is everything for this video I hope
you enjoyed my first decluttering video
like I said if you guys know how to like
give away you just makeup and things
like that let me know even though I
honestly don't think I have a lot of
products from this declutter that I
could give away like things are broken
things are just old you know things like
that but if you guys do know let me know
because you know like the color pop gel
liner I could give away and like the
Revlon photo lights I guess would be a
fine thing to give away I don't know but
I really I seriously I don't know how
that works I've never seen any well
anyone else give away used makeup like
they usually just say they're giving it
to friends and family but if you guys
know please leave in the comments below
because I would love to be able to learn
something you guys did enjoy this
decluttering slash products that I
regret buy and please do give this video
a thumbs up so I know so that in the
future maybe when I have another pile
built up I can film another one for you
guys really glad to be able to get rid
of some stuff because like I said my
makeup collection is just growing and
growing and I don't need to hold on to
things that I don't use that I don't
like that I don't reach for at cetera so
I'm really excited that it was like a
little project that I did on the weekend
and glad to be done with it I feel
lighter you guys so much for watching I
really appreciate all your support and I
will see you again very
in my next video by
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
