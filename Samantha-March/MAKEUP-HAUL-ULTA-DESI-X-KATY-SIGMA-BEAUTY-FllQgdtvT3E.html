today's video is going to be a makeup
hello I have placed an order with Sigma
Beauty dose of colors and then also uLTA
Beauty so I'm going to show you
everything that I placed in my most
recent order so are we get started I do
want to say thank you so much a for
clicking on this video right now I am
posting a daily upload so if you enjoy
getting a video every single day on
makeup of beauty I hope that you will
consider hitting the subscribe button
before you go but if you would like to
see my latest makeup haul and everything
that I purchased why don't I go ahead
and get started so first up I placed an
order with Sigma Beauty which I am so
excited to come over to what I got here
I am an affiliate with Sigma and they do
send me PR from time to time but I don't
get everything from them and I was
really curious about this eyeshadow
palette when they released it but I did
get it sent in PR and I was like I would
still like to get that and this is the
Wildflower it's the eyeshadow and also
cheek palette so when you open it up it
has these different shades inside so you
have eyes shadow so you also have a
really beautiful blush and then also a
highlight shade so here is a close up of
the palette and it is so gorgeous I have
been loving loving on this palette and
reaching for it so much I am definitely
super attracted to these kind of
palettes that have more than just eye
shadows more than just blushes more than
just highlighters like I like how it has
the three different uses in here and I
find myself reaching for it a lot it has
a really nice mirror which i think is
great shadows we're super super
pigmented this blush is gorgeous and so
is the highlight here are a couple
different swatches from the palette so
these are all of the eyeshadows and then
this one is the highlighter and this is
the blush of the eye shadows for super
pigmented the blush is gorgeous and then
the highlight is absolutely gorgeous
this palette is $36 and so far I've been
having a great time with it I would
definitely recommend checking out the
wildflower palette if you think these
shades are like up your alley like they
are mine because I think it's beautiful
pencil did pick up a lipstick from the
wildflower collection and this is an
barely blooming so this is what the
lipstick looks like and so that is the
lipstick swatch right there in fair
blooming now I liked this one I liked
the formula I thought it was pretty but
it was too light on me when I tried it
the first day I actually then topped it
with kind of a lightly pigmented pink
lip gloss to give it a little bit more
umph because it was just a little bit
too light like when I swatch it it
really doesn't even look like it's super
light but on me it didn't look like
concealer like I didn't have concealer
lips it was just too light of a pink
that it didn't exactly match my skin
tone I still liked it I still thought it
was a good lipstick but I wouldn't be
able to wear it alone I'd either have to
have some sort of lip liner and really
fill in my lips or top it with a lip
gloss so if your my skin tone I wouldn't
recommend barely blooming know they had
another lipstick in the collection which
was a little bit darker and these are
$14 so lipstick was good just the shade
didn't work out for me and then I also
picked up this aura powder I have one in
Corday Rosa that was sent to me from
Sigma and I really did like it this one
is called in the saddle corps de Rosa is
a really beautiful terracotta blush on
me and this one I wondered if I could
use it as a bronzer I haven't tried it
out too yet so I'm not 100% oh it has a
little protector thing on it so this is
in the saddle would be a nice light
bronzer maybe if you can see that swatch
on my hand right here not the best at
swatching that does look really pretty
so I'm gonna try it first as a bronzer
and see how I do but I really do like
the the quarter Rosa I like the
packaging on this too it has a nice
mirror so I think I've heard maybe desi
Perkins talked about in the saddle as
well I just thought I'd give it a try
they are classified as blushes on the
Sigma Beauty website there are $19 each
but I want to give it a try right seem a
little bit random but I have so many
makeup brushes if you've been following
my channel for a while you know I have
like a sick obsession with makeup
brushes and I need some more storage I
saw that they have this brush cup holder
on the website it's $25 I have one
really similar to this that I got from
morphe brushes it's a rose gold it came
as part of the copper dreams brush set
and I actually I use it for a storage
here I use it for traveling and I think
it's really handy so when I saw this on
the Sigma website I thought it looked
similar so I picked that up and then I
also picked up two more brushes because
I have a problem with makeup brushes
well I don't know what to do about you
guys it is so ridiculous but the first
one that I picked up was a 56 this is a
shader brush for the lid I don't know
how well you'll be able to see it but it
looks like it's just a leaf this is a
synthetic brush I want to say that's
what it was for I shadow on the lid I
like using synthetic brushes to kind of
like pack on eyeshadows on the lid and I
need it some more of them because mine
are always sturdy so that's the e 56 and
then the other one that I picked up is a
pencil brush this is the e30 pencil
brush I have at least one of these but
again I go through these pencil brushes
all the time I feel like I'm constantly
cleaning my pencil brushes I use them
for the lower lash line so I'm doing any
sort of like crease work and I want
something a little bit more detailed or
smaller I use the pencil brush so I just
feel like I'm always cleaning them so
these are the two brushes that I picked
up the e 56 and the e30 like I said I am
an affiliate with Sigma and it's because
I truly do love them and have been
buying from them for a really long time
I do have an affiliate code with them if
you've ever purchased from Sigma and you
would want to use I discount code my
code is just Samantha and it gets you
10% off at discount it is an affiliate
code so I do make a commission if you
use my code but as always and I think
with a lot of youtubers that money goes
back into my channel so I always
appreciate it if you do use my code with
Sigma but I want to share with you what
I got if you'd like to see any tutorials
with the eyeshadow palette that I showed
you just let me know I know for sure I
will film one for Instagram because I've
been loving it but if you do want to see
one here on YouTube let me know but
that's everything that I got from a
sigma beauty next up I want to show you
guys the order that I got from dose of
colors from the desi xkt collaboration
featured this in a willy by video and I
was so hyped for the collaboration and I
wish I could have bought everything from
the collection but that just wasn't
gonna happen at this time so I picked up
the things that I was most excited for I
love this little card here like what's
this be awkward to hang on my desk like
next to my photos like me and my husband
and me and my friends and then I could
just like put this next to him that
might be a little weird but what I
decided to pick up was the eye
Pellatt this is called the girls because
each of the eyeshadows is named after
their puppies each desi and Katie have
two dogs so I mean this packaging is
freaking amazing like a look at the
amazing packaging I still have like the
plastic right here on it because I'm
just like so afraid I'm gonna ruin
something and then when you open it up
these are the four different eyeshadows
and then it also does have a mirror only
been able to use the palette one time so
far I just got it in the mail this past
week I've only been able to try the
palette out one time and I tried out
this shade right here which i think is
called harpoon but I know there's some
issues on what the shades are actually
called and then I tried this one right
here which is Sue's if I'm if I'm
reading it correctly but I could be very
wrong but so far I thought it was really
pretty I think I'm gonna do a tutorial
on this a lot of people in my snapchat
asks I think maybe in my next tutorial I
will use this I will say it was kind of
hard to work with and I knew that going
into it because two of the shades they
say that you have to use them with water
basically I think just any of the shades
look better with water you also have to
apply them with your fingers versus a
brush and I do have long nails so it's
kind of frustrating when I do have to
use my fingers but I knew all of that
going into it and I still wanted to
purchase the palette because I wanted to
support and I thought these shades were
really pretty oh here's what all the
swatches look like on my fingers and
here is what they look like swatched out
so they are very beautiful and the
payoff is really really pretty
they're definitely just a little bit
tricky to work with but I did like it
this one here I thought was a little bit
chunky kind of like that green Brown
type of shade it is a little bit chunky
but on the eyes I didn't think it was
bad at all but so far I mean I do need
to try it out a couple more times I know
the restock for the full collection is
coming sometime in September they
haven't released a date yet but so far I
think it's pretty good I want to try it
a couple more times before I can give a
solid opinion on it but I mean if you
don't like to use your fingers or if you
wouldn't want to take the time to work
with it I mean this is kind of high
maintenance but I knew that going into
it and I'm still okay with it but I'm
excited to try it
all more times and then the other items
that I wanted to pick up were the two
nude lipsticks I am such a nude lipstick
lover so these are what I decided to go
with and I was trying to decide if I
should get both news there only one nude
the liquid lipsticks that they came out
with were shades that I don't wear very
frequently so I decided to just go with
the news and I wanted to get both of
them because nudes can sometimes be
tricky because we all kind of have our
perfect nude for our skin tone and our
undertone and all of that so I love
nudes but there's a lot of times like
with that Sigma nude I was talking about
that nude really didn't work out for me
it didn't look great on me
so the shades were in no shade and more
creamer plays I thought everything about
this collection like name wise was
absolutely hysterical I love it so this
is what no shade looks like and the
packaging is absolutely gorgeous it has
the DOS logo right there and then it
also does have I don't know if you'd be
able to see it on camera because it's
really light but it has desi and Katy's
names right there as well that one right
there is in no shade I was wearing this
I believe in my holiday video that I
just posted I'm wearing the eye shadow
look from this palette and then also no
shade this one is called more creamer
please and this one is more of a darker
nude I still need to try more creamer
please which is this one right here I
think I'm actually gonna like more
creamer please than no shade because no
shade was a little too like of a beige
nude maybe on me again I just didn't
think it looked absolutely fantastic on
me it was good enough that I didn't top
it with a lip gloss or put a liner on or
anything but I think the next time I
were to wear it I would go in with a
maybe like kind of like a pink lip liner
maybe or like a darker nude so I still
do want to try more creamier please
because I think that's going to be the
new that really works for me from this
collection but let me know if you want
to see a tutorial with these or a review
video or what it is that you guys want
to see like I said the collection is
sold out right now but it is supposed to
be coming back so if a review is more
helpful if you guys were still thinking
about maybe picking it up once it comes
back in stock just let me know what
you're thinking and I'm happy to do so
but so far it's pretty good again the
eyeshadow palette just is a little bit
on the trickier side it to work with but
I did like the formula of the liquid
lipsticks and I'm excited
to try the more creamer please but I
thought the whole collection was super
cute and I just was really excited to
support desi and Katie are some of my
absolute favorite youtubers I think the
way they did this collaboration was
absolutely phenomenal I also was
incredibly impressed at dose of colors
it was a little bit challenging at first
to get in when I first went into the
website when it launched at like I think
maybe it was like noon my time I was
immediately like I added what I wanted
and then it said you know you're now in
a line and let you got the checkout page
one weekend and I was like oh my gosh
are you kidding me it was within two
minutes that I was able to check out so
that really wasn't bad and then I my
order came I want to say in like five
days it was pretty standard to me I
didn't have any troubles with it I got
my order confirmation right away I got
the processing email like two days later
and then the shipping confirmation and
then everything showed up rolling on
time for me and I thought it was really
cool how Anna who owns dose of colors I
was watching both her snapchat and the
dose of color snapchat and they would
show everybody in there working desi and
Katy were in there working their
husbands were in there working I mean
they were really showing like how many
workers were in there they were working
with so many different shifts they're
really trying to get everything out
there in a good amount of time so
honestly I was super impressed by how
the collaboration went down a lot of
times you don't see that with collabs or
even just you know makeup brands in
general very impressed by how well
everything went in my personal case I
don't I mean I haven't really heard any
terrible stories or anything but I was
really impressed with me personally so
that was what I decided to pick up from
the dose of colors and it does the xkt
collaboration and then last up I placed
an order with uLTA Beauty which I was so
excited about I have had an ultimate
gift card for a very long time
and I've been waiting and waiting for
the right occasion to use it and then
last week I got an email saying Alta was
having a platinum Perks day or something
like that or platinum member
appreciation day and they had a bunch of
items that were ten times the points I
loved Altos reward system so much they
were having specific items and specific
brands that were ten times the points
and then everything else was five times
the points so
I made a very large order and I got an
extreme number of points which was kind
of crazy but I am planning my next big
giveaway I think it's gonna be my 30k
giveaway which I'm so excited for so
when I saw that I bought some items in
there that were the 10 times points for
my giveaway because I do get more PR now
so I do have PR in my giveaways that I
don't use or maybe I've gotten a double
up or something like that but still a
lot of my giveaways I still buy the
majority of it so it's really nice when
you can get something like you know
extra cash back at Ebates or if you have
something like this the ten times points
I think it's a great time to buy for my
you know subscriber appreciation
giveaways so I thought that was really
cool so I'm not gonna show you what I
picked up for the giveaway because that
will be coming soon enough but I'll show
you everything else that I purchased
this one was a ten times points I've
been writing this for a while I think I
mentioned in a while I buy it that I
wanted to get it this is from Estee
Lauder it's their double wear nude water
fresh makeup so it's a foundation I
always heard really good things about
the Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation
but I also always heard that it was
super super full coverage and I'm not a
big full coverage foundation lover so
when I saw that they came out with this
water fresh foundation it's supposed to
be really similar to it but not quite as
full coverage not quite as heavy so I
wanted to give it a try this is what the
bottle looks like I believe this was $42
it does say on the back the only thing
it says shake well that's it does have a
SPF 30 in it and I picked up mine in the
shade 3c2 or pebble so I'm not sure if
that would be a great shade match for me
but I am really excited I will be giving
this a try as well I just kind of read
this I've had this on at my wish list
for such a long time it's been on my
Sephora loves list it's been in my Ulta
cart for a while but when I thought it
was gonna be 10 times the points I was
like I'm just gonna go ahead and pick it
up and then also what has been on my
list for a while as a couple more items
here from dose of colors I know it's so
funny because I placed a separate dose
of colors orders but like I said the
Ulta reward system is really really good
like I just couldn't pass up some of
these from dose of colors because I've
been eyeing them for a while so I picked
up two items from their recent mint for
you collection which I think this mint
package
is super super cute so I picked it up
but these weren't ten times points
they've but they were still the five
times points which I thought was pretty
freaking awesome so this is their loose
pigment and primer it's the ideal duo I
have been eyeing the ideal duo's from
dose of colors for such a long time so
when I saw this I was just talking on
Twitter the other day about how much I
wanted some items from the mint for you
collection and then when I saw the five
times points and I knew I was about to
make a big ol order I was like I'm just
going for it so this is what the
packaging looks like for the ideal duos
and then when you open it up you have
like this pressed powder right here that
looks really pretty and then I think you
yes you unscrew this and then you have
the loose pigment right here so I think
what you do first is you put on the
pressed powder as more of kind of like
your base and then you would come in and
do the loose powder on top of it so I
think this one was in the shade mint to
me so it's supposed to be you know the
cement type of color so I'm so excited
to use that they had a rose gold one too
which I almost purchased but I'm like I
always wear those type of colors like I
wanted to use something a little bit
more out there do hear really good
things about these ideal duos from dose
of colors so I just I just had to give
it a try I think this was in the $20
range and then the other item that I
purchased was one of their liquid matte
lipstick did try a dose of colors
lipstick for the first time a liquid
lipstick for the first time this year in
stone and I absolutely loved it so I
thought I would pick up another one this
one is in mint tea mint tea mint tea
about those they were cute so there's
what the packaging looks like so it has
like a little bit different packaging
from the regular collection would be
more of the mint top and then I just
want to go ahead and do ooh that is a
really pretty pink oh that's really
pretty
okay so that is what the mint tea looks
like and again this is a liquid lipstick
and I really did enjoy that formula so I
am excited to give that a try so I just
I just had to do it I've been I've been
really eyeing that for a while and I was
like 5 times points I just I'm just
gonna do it so it in and then another
lipstick I pick
this is one that I also talked about in
a will I buy it that I wanted to get
it's a new matte lipstick from Anastasia
Beverly Hills it's just called the matte
lipsticks and I got the shade dead roses
because why not like sounds like a happy
name right I've never really quite sure
how I ended up picking out dead roses
because there's a lot different shades
in there but that is the one that I
ended up going with so here is what the
packaging on the lipstick looks like
really nice packaging and then let's see
ooh I think I'm gonna like that shade
there is what dead roses look like so
that is the swatch of dead roses I'm
excited to try out that formula and see
what I think let me know if anybody has
gotten any of the Anasazi lipsticks and
then the last item that I got for myself
from Ulta during their platinum
appreciation day was the highlighter I
know I know I know
I know I have been on a highlight no buy
for how long like three months or
something I have said no to buying
highlights like individual highlights
but I broke down and did it it was five
times points but it was also only like
four dollars or $4.99 this is from wet
and wild
it's one of their mega glow highlighting
powders and I got mine and precious
petals so this is what it looks like and
I just had to succumb I just had to do
it so many people are talking about
these so many people are comparing them
to high end my friend Olivia did a whole
glow down showdown I think is what she
called it I can link her video down
below but she compared a bunch of high
end highlighters to like all wet and
wild ones and the one Wilde's were like
so I'm like you know what I just I have
to do it like I said it was only like
four dollars and then with the five
times more I saw like oh no big deal
right so I decided to get it if you guys
have tried any of the one wild
highlighter so let me know but I'm
excited to finally try them out because
I feel like everybody has tried them
except for me so I finally got him but
after that that's everything that I
picked up for myself from Ulta during
their platinum appreciation sale like I
said I picked up a couple of giveaway
items too and I think if I can get
everything put together in time I'm
gonna do a 30k subscriber giveaway
coming up very soon so I'm super excited
about that but after
Aalto order that is going to do it for
my latest makeup ah
