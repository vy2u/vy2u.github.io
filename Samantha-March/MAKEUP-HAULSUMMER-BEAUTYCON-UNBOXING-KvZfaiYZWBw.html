today's video I'm going to be doing a
bit of a collective haul I have just a
few items that I have recently picked up
for myself I have an order from actally
that I want to share with you guys and
to kind of explain how that program
works if you guys are beauty influencers
and interested in getting free products
to review and then I also was sent the
summer beautycon box which I am a really
excited for I've never gotten that
beautycon bucks before so I'm excited to
go through that I actually haven't
opened it yet so I'm really anxious to
see what it's all in there but yeah if
you would like to see my collective
makeup and beauty haul please keep
watching a few items that I have picked
up for myself and they actually oddly
enough are all from Maybelline was not
planned but the first thing that I
picked up was one of their new color
tattoo I chromes so this is what it
looks like it's supposed to be like a
metallic eyeshadow I chrome its you know
the metallic rage is all in right now
the shade I picked up was in beige
luster and I can go ahead and do a
swatch for you guys I first got this i
swatched it on my hand and it lasted the
whole night it did not budge there is
the swatch of beige luster really pretty
color swatch on the hand I don't think
it gives as much as it does on the eyes
because when i first watched on my hand
I was like okay that's really pretty but
I'm like mmm it almost looks kind of
light like it didn't like pop out at me
but when I do apply it to the eyes I
thought it worked out much better so
this is kind of like a thing that I'm
like don't let the swatch fool you I was
much more impressed when I put it on my
eyes I've only worn it the one time on
my eyes so I do kind of want to wear it
again but it was for quite a few hours
that I wore it and it held up really
well there was a little bit of like the
creasing action going on which is kind
of what I wondered with the formula of
this as if it would crease really bad it
wasn't anything too terrible but it was
something that I definitely did notice
but I'm gonna keep trying this out and I
will have it in an upcoming review video
soon another new product from Maybelline
is they're super say better skin skin
transforming a powder so this is what it
looks like and I have been hearing so
many people talk about this powder and I
just had to pick it up for myself so
inside you do have a me
sure then you also have like a little
sponge right here and then the powder so
I was very curious to try it I really do
love maybelline's foundations powders
etc I pretty much love them all I do
really like the butter skin line I have
the foundation and the concealer
actually have both on right now and then
I did put the powder over my better skin
liquid foundation to set everything I've
only used this twice so far you should
see it in an upcoming tutorial as well
if I haven't used it or if that video
hasn't gone up yet so far I really do
like it I'm going to keep trying it out
of course because like i said i've only
used it twice and i haven't really been
able to let it see how long it lasts on
the skin so that is what kind of today
is for because i did my make up early
and i plan to have it on all night long
so we'll see how it lasts but once again
i will have this in an upcoming review
video then the last thing i purchased is
actually a repurchase it is the
Maybelline fit me concealer I absolutely
love this concealer and I have been
getting down there on mine so I had to
pick up a new one when I was at CP yes
the other day so this is just I put it
in my ride-or-die this is my Holy Grail
concealer share a few products that have
recently received from a silly I hope
I'm saying that name right but actively
is basically a website that kind of
connects brands and then beauty
influencers you do need to have a
certain number of subscriber counts on
your YouTube and Instagram in order to
get accepted into actively but if you do
I definitely suggest you sign up I'll
leave a link below to do that is a
referral link it's not like a monetary
link but I believe you get like extra
points within a cailli but I also just
kind of how it works is that they have a
free store so when I signed up you get
five points and then you have five
points to be able to request free items
and I will kind of show you the things
that I got sent and when I say free i
mean free in exchange for a review you
do have to feature them in your videos
somehow you can put them in halls and
tutorials if you have a favorite
products you can put it in there it
doesn't matter really what your video is
about but they do need to be on there
somehow some brands will ask you to make
a dedicated video so you can only talk
about that product in your video or only
talk about products from that brand in
that video but most of them that I found
don't sell like you can do something
like I'm going to do now which is a haul
video and feature these products but you
are getting the product a full-size
product for free in exchange for your
review I just always want to say that
when I say free but that's what they
call it in actively it's called their
free store and they had some really
great brands on there when i finally got
accepted i was so excited and i was
going through the store and I was seeing
like Peter cosmetics and their real
techniques Charlotte Tilbury I just saw
the other day and I mean they just they
have so many different things but you
can't just sign up for you know 20 30
products at once you get those points so
I believe everyone starts with the five
points so you can request five items
once you get that item you have 15 days
from when it was delivered to you to get
it in a video and get that video up and
then share your link in your actally
account once your review goes up you
will get a point back and I think you
get points for like referring people so
that's why i said if you do want to send
it for actually if you want to use my
link that would be fantastic because I
think you do get points for like
referring and things like that I'm not
exactly a hundred percent on the point
system but I believe that is what
someone mentioned it in a form that i
was looking at so you can kind of build
it up but yeah you can't just get a ton
of products at once and then you know
not doing anything that's kind of how
they keep the system in check which i
think is a really great idea have some
products here that i want to go over
with you guys but again pure beauty
influencer I would definitely say to
check out octiline lily is different
it's not like famebit or grape vine or
things like that where you're actually
working with the brands and a sponsored
video this is not a sponsored video
octave lee's not sponsoring these brains
are not sponsoring it's not any sort of
like payment system like with the other
two websites that i mentioned it is just
you get something in exchange for
putting it in a video of that makes
sense one thing that I got is from Real
Techniques and it is their ultimate base
set so this is what it looks like it
comes with a powder brush a concealer
brush and also the miracle complexion
sponge which is like one of my favorite
favorites out there so I was really
excited to try it I I have actually
tried out the two brushes I did a back
to school makeup tutorial it should be
coming soon if it's not already up and I
use both these brushes the concealer
brush
the smaller one over here definitely
stood out to me I thought it's fantastic
this one I will keep playing with and
see my final thoughts on it but I can
also put these two brushes in upcoming
review video if you guys would want to
see it and also in there it did come
with this case where it can be like a
little traveling case and you can put
your brushes in there and then it also
does have a mirror in it as well so I
thought that was really exciting and I
really do like real techniques I love
the sponge so I was really excited to
get this set I also got a couple things
from pure cosmetics which excited me so
much because I love pure I just I've
been getting into pure cosmetic so much
more lately and I was just really
excited to be able to receive these I
actually do have one more item coming I
was going to try to wait for that other
item to get here and do like a full
video about the pure cosmetics hall but
it's not here yet like i said you only
have so many days until you need to get
these videos up so I figured I would
just put everything in this haul video
so the first thing that I got from pier
is there sun kissed glow strobe and
highlight palette so this is what the
packaging looks like very gold and very
shiny but it is a highlight palette and
I do love highlight pallets so this is
what the packaging looks like and then
when you open it up you do have a mirror
here and then you have three different
highlight shades so you have like more
of like a lighter gold like a rose gold
pinky color and then more of a bronze
and it just says on the back it says or
a solar and dusk so I believe it goes
aurora solar desk okay so I have
actually swatch all these and I have
worn the center one on my cheekbones one
time what I will say about these these
are a cream highlight which I really do
like cream highlights and I think they
help if you struggle with texture where
you often highlight your face because I
do I think cream highlights don't show
the texture as much as the powder
highlights I will say these don't give
like a very like like Anasazi Beverly
Hills bilocate where you get that like
metallic in your face highlight these
are much more on the subtle side but you
still get a highlight it's not like you
put it on your like did I put anything
on it just definitely is more subtle
than some of the other BAM highlight
rights but at the same time I also
really do like cream highlights to set a
powder highlight so I want to try that
with one of these as well and see how it
works as like kind of like a base for a
powder highlight and see if I like that
as well but all three of these shades I
thought were really pretty as a little
worried about the darkest one it sounds
like I don't know if I'll be able to
pull that off but I'm definitely going
to try it because it's not so like in
your face it might give enough of a
subtle glow that it was still look
really pretty on my skin tone and not
like what is she trying to do but I was
really really excited to get those
because I just love highlighting and two
other things that I received from pure
one is there a fully-charged of mascara
now I do not have this mascara I've
never tried it but I have heard so many
people talk about this and so many
people like rave about it and even in my
what was it was it my writer dynamic of
tag someone wrote in that their rider
die mascara was the fully charged from
pier and I was like wait I just got it
i'm so excited but this is what the
mascara looks like i'm actually I'm
probably not going to open it right away
just because mascara can go bad so fast
and since this is a full-size product I
want to get through maybe a couple of
like my minis before I open a full size
but I am really really excited to try
this then the last thing that i got from
pure i also was like out of my mind when
they said that they would send me one
because it's therefore in one pressed
mineral makeup if you guys watched my
ride-or-die makeup tag this is what i
said is my writer diet powder foundation
so i was so excited i'm almost out of my
other one I was just so so excited to
get this this one is like all taped up
but I can show you this is just what the
inside looks like there's all your
powder you have a nice mirror here the
shade that I pick up is in pan and I
fish think I've been wearing this powder
foundation for years and years and years
I've gone through so many of these so to
have another one I am just so excited
about so I will leave links to all these
products in the description box below
and again i will leave the link to
actually in case you are Beauty
influencer and you want to check that
out but that's everything that I've
recently received from actively
hopefully I will have more to show
you guys soon too I want to show you
guys is the beautycon box so I started
to open this because I was going to go
through everything and then I was like
don't be selfish I was actually gonna do
it on my snapchat first but I was gonna
do it right before I filmed this video
but snapchat has been down like all day
the day that I'm filming I don't know
what's going on like I can't even login
it just says like what's there's some
error message it keeps saying so I'm
like okay so this is gonna be like first
impressions during the video because I
can't kid snap yet to work so sorry
about that but this is the beauty
comment box this was sent me like I said
it's not a sponsored video or anything
like that or not getting paid for it
they just asked if they could send me
the box and if I'd want to share it with
my subscribers and i do want to because
you guys might know that i recently
canceled my Ipsy subscription because i
just wasn't very happy about it so I'm
excited to try out this new box and see
what I think of it what I understand is
that beautycon is an annual box so you
would get it four times a year so this
is the summer box that i will be going
through i also was given a discount code
if you guys want to use it it's not an
affiliate code it's just a discount code
for you guys that code is b/c some sam i
will put it here and it'll be honest in
the description box below as well but bc
some sam and that will get you five
dollars off that expires august 31st so
probably not a whole lot of time yet but
if you want to get five dollars off the
summer box you can with my code and i
believe all the boxes are the same so
everything that i'll show you guys in
here will be in your box so if it's
something that you think you want to get
i would say go ahead and do it she also
did let me know that for if you do just
seasonal boxes its twenty nine dollars
if you sign up for an annual plan to get
all four boxes in that one year it is
ninety-nine dollars so let's go ahead
and go through the box the first thing
that I pulled out is Ben Zach acne
solutions it's a blemish clearing
hydrator with calming and soothing East
Indiana sandalwood oil so I always
really enjoy getting skin care so i will
be excited to try this out it says it is
with salicylic acid which I do like as
well oh this is what that looks like so
do like getting skin care so i will put
this in
bathroom I think I pulled out is from
Smashbox it's their brow tech shaping
powder this is what it looks like and I
really want to open this up it says the
shade is in taupe which think would be
my shade so this is for your brows says
this micro-fine loose powder shapes and
a solemn to create natural or bold brows
our unique precision applicator fills
and sparse areas and mimics natural
hairs that's really cool I don't think
I've ever seen this before and you guys
know I'm trying to like step up my brow
game recently so oh ok so that is what
the applicator looks like and it has the
product on there as well I will
definitely be giving this a try has
anyone else heard of this or do you have
this does it work tell me about it i
will definitely be giving this a try i'm
very curious to try this from Smashbox
alright the next thing I pulled out Oh
is from NYX it's one of their ombre lip
duos I always wanted to try this but I
never pick one up so on one side you
have a lipstick and on the other side
you have the lip liners in the shade
peaches and cream ooh ok so that's what
it looks like ok so that is going to be
really cool I'm not going to swatch it
because I think it looks like like a red
in an orange so I'm not sure that's
totally going to be my style so I might
keep this for a giveaway I'm not sure if
I decide to keep it i will do some
swatches on instagram but we will see
says line your lips with the darker
shade and apply the lighter shade to the
center of your lips Pat lips together to
blend and voila you have on bright lift
cell that is pretty cool so I just
pulled out two little things from la
fraiche one is an instinct cooling
bodysuit there revitalizes and suz dry
overworked skin on contact with
peppermint moisture ok so that's kind of
neat especially for like hot summer days
I get it I get it and then the other one
from la fraiche is a nail polish remover
it's acetone free and has a fresh Tuscan
orange scent and it said one pad cleans
conditions all ten nails okay so that's
interesting I like that I like that so
these are both from la fraiche oh my
gosh I'm so excited this is the Too
Faced better than sex waterproof mascara
like a little deluxe guy of this this
really excites me because I have not
tried this yet and so many people talk
about it ooh that's really cool the
other thing I just pulled out from NYX
is one of their jumbo eye pencils and
this is in Kashmir this really excites
me I have the jumbo pencil in milk as
well I would swatch this for you guys
because I believe I would keep this one
but it's I'm going to need like a
tweezers to get it open and I don't have
one right by my side right now but this
looks like a really cool color but i
really really love their jumbo eye
pencil is i'm really excited to have
another shade in this it looks almost
like i like a metallic gold type of
color so that one's in kashmir really
excited about this okay this is from a
versus spa face moisturizing gradual
tanner that's really cool so like a self
tanner for your face but school versus
spa isn't that like I used to do spray
tans allah and i thought that was called
like the verso spa so maybe that's the
same thing it says use daily to restore
skin and develop a glow apply evenly
over face and neck in a smooth circular
motion watch hands directly after use a
lot of 28 hours before getting white i
really want to try this out like right
now that's awesome very cool oh my gosh
this is one of my favorite products this
is from Neutrogena it's their ultra
light cleansing oil I have this in my
bathroom upstairs and I'm probably more
than halfway out of it this is awesome
so this effortlessly and completely
removes waterproof makeup dirt and oil
it rinses clean without stripping I love
using a cleansing oils to clean my face
and I love the Neutrogena one like I
said I am like I don't know I'm probably
like right there on my bottle and i'm so
excited now I have another woman this
was really like one of my favorite
products this makes me so happy gosh
this is a huge bottle this is from a
redken and it says it is their texture
fashion waves it's a sea salt spray look
at how big this bottle is are you
you me right now dang that's awesome a
sea salt spray I have always wanted one
of these I haven't had one I had one
once but it was like way back in college
but I remember really liking it I've
just never gotten one again so you just
shake well before use and you spray it
on wet or dry hair to enhance waves and
add a beachy texture this is a huge
bottle this is 8.5 fluid ounces from
redken oh that's friggin awesome we have
a brush in here too this is from cover
FX and it is there contour brush I love
love love getting makeup brushes so I
was like always my favorite part about
if see and I think I only ever got like
two brushes hoes like no I want more
brushes it's actually a double ended
brush what okay so this is what one side
looks like and then this is the other
side so I'm not really sure I'm getting
the contouring of it but I feel like I
could make something happen with this
brush that's really cool i don't have a
lot of dual sided brushes I don't have
any brushes from cover FX I don't even
know if I knew that me brushes but cool
a double ended brush okay so we are
almost finished just like a coupon I
think it says fifteen percent off and
free shipping from the Edit by 1700
dokie so that is what that looks like so
it looks like fifteen percent off with
the edit and exclusive online pop-up
shop featuring the falls how does trans
handpicked by our editors so from 17
very cool but then one last thing and
I'm so excited because it skincare once
again but I've worn it to buy this it
from Garnier's skin active one of my
favorite lines it's their brightening
and smoothing daily moisturizer I am so
excited for this garnier skin active
that line is a skincare line that I am
obsessed with I have so many different
products from them and I think it is
fantastic so it says this is oil free
and has vitamin C love me some vitamin C
in LH a and antioxidant complex it has
SPF 15 in there oh I am so excited to
try this out oh okay so that was the
final item in there and that was an
awesome box I don't really know what I
was expecting I haven't really
seen a lot of people talk about the
beautycon box you know I always see like
the Ipsy on begging's the Birchbox and
the boxy charm even like fab fit fine
I'm seeing a lot more on YouTube but I
really don't see a lot of beautycon but
holy crud that was a freaking awesome
bucks and I am so excited I think the
only thing that I was like I'm not sure
all accused is that nyx ombre lip pencil
simply because of the color that it's in
like I don't really wear those like
bright reds and oranges a lot but heck I
might just just to say about everything
else and write everything else I'm going
to use gives you a card as well right
here so it says everything that was on
there and yeah legit I think everything
maybe not be the nail polish remover
because I have fake nails but yeah
everything else that is really really
really freaking cool I am so excited so
