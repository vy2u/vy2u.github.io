today's video is going to be about
makeup products that I purchased that I
am NOT getting my money's worth out of
so a couple days ago I posted makeup
products that I've purchased that I have
gotten my money's worth out of and I
asked him there if you guys would want
to see the flipside of this video and so
many people said yes that I decided just
to get it on my filming list or right
away so I'm gonna be talking over some
makeup products that I've purchased that
I am NOT getting my money's worth out of
which is the super disappointment but if
you would like to see those products why
don't I go ahead and get started so I'm
sorry if my lighting is crazy I'm
filming at like 5:30 so the Sun is
starting to set but we just got our
internet back we haven't had internet
for two days and the technician finally
just left so I was finally able to start
filming again so yay but jumping into it
this was one when I was looking through
my collection for my previous video I
stumbled upon this palette and I was
like oh you guys if you would want to
see makeup that I'm not getting my mind
without of I can make a video on this
product this is from Urban Decay it's
their afterglow highlight palette I was
so excited about this palette I like
right before this released I started
trying their sin highlight just the
individual sin and absolutely loved it
so when this was coming out so many
people were tagging me oh man and I was
like yes I absolutely have to have this
one so you have four shades inside here
you do get a mirror there's ons cliche
wicked and no angel I purchased this for
$34 and like two weeks after I bought it
it went discounted for I think it was
like 20-some dollars and now it's just
kind of - 19 dollars but I paid full
price for it
so that kind of hurt I just don't use
this palette I just don't use it I
definitely am NOT gonna get my money's
worth out of this palette and no matter
how many times I look at it and think
like okay girl reach into that palette
I'm like no I don't want to the shades
aren't absolutely terrible I prefer a
cliche and no angel over here and I mix
them together but these are not like
that sin highlighter to me and they're
just not my favorite highlight so this
was a oh man I was so bummed but
definitely when I was going through my
collection I saw this I was like if you
guys want me to do the flip side of this
video I told I could all about that free
highlight palette has such a
disappointment to me okay so next up on
my list I have a couple mark Jakob
products here and this is rough this is
rough so one of them is the spotlight
glow stick which looks like this which I
believe this one is $42 so this is like
a cream highlight and honestly like I
just don't get a lot of use out of cream
highlights regardless so would I get $42
worth out of this highlight I truly
don't think so sometimes especially in
the summer if I gear more towards cream
products I'll put a little bit on but
I'm usually always layering something
over it I typically don't wear a cream
highlight by itself but truly I just
don't get my money's worth out of a lot
of cream products anymore these days and
that can be said for the Marc Jacobs and
then the other product here is the Marc
Jacobs do you do drops the coconut gel
do drops I don't even know why I bought
this because I knew I wasn't going to
absolutely love it and this is $44 but
so many people were raving about it and
also they were raving up up the coconut
bronzer and that went out of stock I
think maybe I bought this highlight and
like okay fine bronzer you're out of
stock Aloha I'm gonna buy the highlight
joke's on you no joke's on me because
again I don't really use liquid
highlight liquid cream highlight I just
don't gravitate towards them and I knew
that when I bought this I was like no
I'm still gonna do it are both of these
products really nice and really
beautiful and especially this liquid
highlight is so so stunning but I don't
personally wear these types of products
a ton I don't gravitate towards them a
time I mean I am just not going to get
my money's worth out of these high-end
highlighters which is super super
disappointing to me I hate when that
happens okay so next up this one is a
little bit I still wanted to include it
I still wanted to include this is from
busy art this is their theory palette in
nuance so technically I did get this not
technically I did I did get this in my
beauty lish lucky bag which is $75 for
the lucky bag you don't know what you're
getting inside it's a surprise of
products from the brands that they share
but they sell on the Beauty lush site
and
you do pay for shipping for it so total
class of the bag is $82.00 I
unfortunately did not love my bag and
the only item that I ended up keeping
for myself was this palette so
technically this pellet cost me eighty
two dollars but if we don't look at it
that way and we just go off of this
palette alone it's $45 I still wanted to
include it because technically I did
still purchase it purchase the bike I
just didn't know if this was coming
inside but if this was a palette that I
had purchased myself and had paid the
$45 for this to me is not a $45
eyeshadow palette and I'm sorry and that
totally bums me out because a lot of
people have really good things to say
about all of the visi art palettes but
this to me is just is just not really
doing it but I also realized I hadn't
even touched up my lipstick after I had
the most moody stuff a little bit my lip
topper back on of course all my makeup
will be linked down below this makeup
look is also from Friday's get ready
with me video if you're curious about it
but like I was saying I mean how do I
put this the quality to me is not
anything earth-shattering
there's better quality out there I truly
believe and I know people say some busy
art pellets are different from other
busy art pellets so if I'm just going
off these theory palettes I don't think
the quality is that great also the shade
selection in here is just kind of
underwhelming to me and that's really
interesting because when I first opened
this I was like oh yeah you know these
are my kind of tones I can create pretty
neutral looks with it and it'll be great
I just am NOT inspired to reach for this
palette and I just don't really like any
of the looks that I've created with this
palette I haven't really loved them and
sometimes when I've gone into this
palette I found myself reaching into
other palettes to finish off the look
because I just don't love this palette
so you know whether I paid the 82
dollars in my view dalish bag or whether
I would have just bought this as a $45
retail price I'm not gonna get my
money's worth out of this so next up I
have another palette that I did
declutter but I thought I would mention
it because in my products that I did get
my money's worth out of I mentioned the
Anastasio modern renaissance palette and
I said I love that palette so much it's
what kind of made me go on to purchase
subculture and I don't
- forethought of subculture I did go on
and declutter it in my high-end
eyeshadow palette declutter video and I
didn't absolutely hate the palette like
I didn't make a hate video on YouTube
about it I didn't mind the palette at
all and I felt like I was creating some
pretty cool looks with it definitely was
a harder palette to like get the hang of
and and all of that but the looks that I
was doing I thought was pretty nice I
ended up getting the dupe palette from I
think it's bad habit and I actually
really enjoyed that one and I thought it
was just a little bit easier to play
with them the subculture so I decided
that I was just gonna boot the
subculture out of my palette collection
so I did so that's a $42 palette and I
don't think I got my money's worth out
of all the the eyeshadow looks that I
create with that palette which is a
bummer
and then next palette here this one is
kind of sad to me but it's true
this one here is from dose of colors
it's the collaboration with Katy and
desi oh man
this was only a $28 palette which really
isn't that bad and the scheme of things
you do get the four shades inside and
you have the mirror in here but this
palette I just like barely touched and
I'm so sad about that because Katy and
desi are two of my absolute favorites
dose of colors is a favorite brand of
mine I was very excited when I saw that
they were doing this collaboration I
really wanted to pick up the girls
palette the shade names are all after
their dogs I loved it but unfortunately
these shades are just really really hard
to work with and if they do all need to
be used with water which I don't enjoy a
lot of them are best if you apply with
your fingers which I don't enjoy and I
just have very sparingly reached into
this palette again it's only $28 so it's
like oh it's not like the high-end pella
are not talking a forty fifty dollar
palette but truly I have used this
palette such a miniscule number of times
that I don't really believe that I've
gotten my $28 worth out of this palette
and that makes me very sad so next up I
have two here from Tarte cosmetics it is
their rainforest of the sea both the
foundation and the concealer the
foundation is $39 and the concealer is
$26 I actually have these in my eighteen
and twenty eighteen project pan video
and I realize
since then that these projects cause my
skin a lot of irritation I guess there's
a high alcohol count in each of them and
basically I can't really wear these
products I didn't quite realize it until
I started wearing them on a pretty
consistent basis that my skin was just
left irritated or breaking out every
time I would use them like two three
four days in a row and I'm like what is
going on here so I'm actually gonna kick
them out of my project pan and not even
have them in my collection anymore
because they just don't bode well with
my skin at all which is a disappointment
so for a high-end foundation and then
also a high-end concealer I feel like I
got like a decent amount of wear out of
them it's not just like I wore each one
you know three or four times and was
like get out of here bro I wore them a
decent amount of times but I still don't
feel like I'm gonna get my money's worth
out of them I think maybe when it comes
to foundation and concealers I feel like
I can get through them it takes me a
while don't get me wrong but I think for
the fact that I can't even wear these on
my skin is what has it in my head that
I'm not gonna get my money's worth out
of these so I thought that was pretty
disappointing another foundation that I
have here this is from hourglass this is
their vanish stick foundation this is a
pricey little foundation this guy is $46
and I still have a lot left like as I
started to film this video I started to
twist it all up and I mean I can just
twist for days I have a lot left of this
foundation it's just not one of my
favorites I don't love stick foundations
I don't purchase a ton of them but you
know this started getting super hyped up
and I was like I'm gonna go ahead and do
it I think I purchased it in a vib sale
so I probably got a bit of a discount
but still that's a higher price
foundation and it's just not my absolute
favorite I picked up my shade of nude
that's a fine shade but it definitely I
don't think it's meant for oily people
because even though I have dry skin I
feel like I really have to powder my
face and I look very oily by the end of
the day but again just like the wear
time on me wasn't the best and it just
isn't my favorite foundation so am I
gonna get 46 dollars worth out of this
foundation I honestly don't think so and
truly I can't even remember the last
time that I wore this foundation I just
don't really reach for it so that's a
bummer so if I have some lip products
these are both from fenty Beauty I have
there
Mademoiselle lipstick in up to no good
and also the gloss bomb
so the up to no good I've talked about
this one recently I kind of fell into
the hype of like not even the hype of
the expectation that you have to have
everything from Fendi and love
everything from Fendi so I ended up
purchasing this lipstick I think I've
worn this lipstick a total of three
times and I really don't feel the need
to like wear it again it's an
interesting color it's not my favorite
color it's kind of like a strange like
peachy orange like it's unique but it's
not something that I can pull off but I
do have dry lips and this is a matte
lipstick and even though it goes on
creamy it dries really horrendously on
my lips and just doesn't look good and
don't feel confident wearing this so for
as many uses as I've gotten out of this
lipstick it's a bit of a bummer for me
and then also the fenty lip gloss this
was $18 so again you know I think it
went into like having to love empty
which is why I purchased this because
I'm not a glip glops person I don't buy
a lot of lip glosses I don't have a huge
of lip gloss collection but I still
spent $18 on a lip gloss is this a fine
lip gloss yes I like the way it smells
it looks pretty decent on my lips I feel
like I have other glosses like it in my
collection I do wish that they would
have had the mini I think you get the
mini in the set with like the mini
highlight as well if that has been out I
totally would have purchased that
instead of going for $18 for the big guy
so it's a little bit disappointing but
especially because I'm not a lipgloss
person I'm not gonna get a ton of uses
out of this and it's not my absolute
favorite lip gloss that I'm always
reaching for I'm reaching for usually my
Marc Jacobs sugar sugar or now I reach
for the urban decay glasses quite a bit
so
I don't think I'm getting my money's
worth out of this still nonetheless it's
just not we're just not meant to be
together so the final item that I would
like to share is the most expensive item
in my makeup collection this cost me a
thousand dollars and I truly don't think
that I'm going to get my money's worth
out of a one thousand dollar blush okay
so I didn't pay $1,000 for this blush
this is from NARS and Goulet or
something along those lines
this was the blush that you received
when you were a Sephora vib Rouge member
this was maybe like two years ago or so
this is what you got for spending a
thousand dollars in a calendar year at
Sephora BAM
can you see it I'm definitely not going
to get a thousand dollars worth out of
this blush but the regular NARS blushes
are $30 and those are like the regular
sized blushes this is just a mini cuz
that's how much Sephora file because
it's QP you only get many products as
your reward but I mean even a $30 blush
I don't think I would get to my moneys
for thought of if this was the $30 but I
have used this blush like four times in
like two years
okay but maybe like six times in two
years but I'm not gonna get my money's
worth out of it a lot of times the
Sephora rewards I think last year it was
like a brush a mini brush I don't even
know where that brushes it gone so
that's kind of disappointing but this
one I just had to put in there because
it's just like it's just too funny not
to talk about this tiny $1,000 blush I'm
alright okay so that's gonna do it for
today's video talking over some of the
makeup products that I feel like I have
not gotten my money's worth out in my
makeup collection I would love to know
some of yours down below and of course I
will have my other video also listed
down in the description box if you
haven't caught that one yet but as
always if you guys enjoyed this video I
hope that you'll give it a thumbs up I
hope that you'll also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
