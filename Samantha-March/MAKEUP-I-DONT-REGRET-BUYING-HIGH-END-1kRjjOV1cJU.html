today's video is going to be all about
makeup that I don't regret buying so a
couple videos back I posted a makeup
I don't regret not buying and a lot of
people really seem to like it the video
had really good feedback which had me
really excited I was reading through the
comments and people are saying could I
do a video on makeup that I don't regret
fine so makeup that I bought and I'm
still very happy with my purchase and I
thought that would be a great idea so
that's what today's video is going to be
this video is going to be all high-end
is going through my collection and
making my list I had a fairly large list
so I thought maybe for the first one I
could split it in half I could do a
high-end one and then if you'd want to
see drugstore products that I don't
regret buying I could definitely do that
as well so be comment down below and I
can film it but for now if you would
like to see the high-end Omega products
that I do not regret buying please keep
watching so when I go into my collection
I was trying to pick items that I really
really love like really love to talk
about it in order to try to help cut
this video down as well and then also I
try to focus on a lot of products that
were maybe like high stuff and like I
bought into the height but they don't
regret it and that sort of thing so one
foundation that I'm super happy with and
I definitely don't regret buying is the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
and concealer this was one that when it
came out a lot of people started talking
about it a lot of people were doing like
the review videos just on the foundation
the wear tests on this foundation a lot
of people are talking about a lot of
people are wearing it I was like I'm
going to get it I think I got a during
one of the Sephora VIP sales but
honestly I don't think the price as bad
as $27
I recommend this all the time it is full
coverage but not suffocating not cakey
looking on the skin with sometimes for
me that's why I steer away from full
coverage because it just doesn't look
good on my face it looks like I'm
wearing a lot of foundation when I wear
full coverage this one does not do that
it's also very long-lasting I recommend
this for like brides quite a bit I
define myself recommending this all the
time it's what I'm wearing on my face
today I love this foundation you get a
lot for I think a good price for a
high-end product so this is a high-end
foundation that I have no regrets
purchasing so a concealer is that
is so very hyped about I don't know if I
have ever seen a concealer have this
much hype I really don't know about
answer watching the best of beauty 2016
videos I don't think I saw one video
that didn't mention this concealer as a
favorite you guys know what I'm talking
about already should I even touch I say
should I do
do you guys know something it's the Tori
Shay case I mean everybody loves this
concealer everybody fell madly in love
with it it's increasing how much hype
this concealer is getting but it is so
good with this one I honestly wouldn't
even say that I bought into the hype and
that's why I bought it when it came out
I was just interested in it because I
like concealers like I'm not weird
personal like I like weird things when
it comes to makeup everybody goes
bananas over eyeshadow palettes and I'm
like a new concealer cool like that's
what I like so when I thought coming out
I was like yeah I'm going to get that
concealer and I did mine is in the shade
light/medium and then i was super happy
that i did because it like immediately
sold out and i was like holy bananas the
tarte shaped a highly recommend I know
it's been coming back in fact and more
people have been able to get their hands
on it I definitely recommend it it's a
full coverage concealer but it doesn't
crease on me I just think it's fantastic
so I have a setting powder to talk about
I probably mentioned this in my best of
beauty 2016 video you probably are going
to see a lot of these products in the
best of beauty 2016 video like I'm not
going to be surprised as almost all of
these were mentioned in there this is
the laura mercier secret brightening
powder so everybody was raving about the
laura mercier translucent powder and I
actually was able to try it a friend had
it and I tried it out and I did not like
it at all I went with the secret
brightening powder because I liked the
brightening on your eye effect as well I
like concealers that obviously conceal
but I also like concealers that
highlight under the eyes and then I like
setting powders that I think brighten up
the under eyes as well I just really
liked the bright under eyes book so that
was another reason why I went with this
guy it's also smaller than the
translucent powder that one comes in
like a big old jar but it's also less
expensive and still like I have had this
for a very long time and I can tell that
I put a dent into it but I still am able
to wear it so often I have it on my
under eyes today it's just a product
that I really really love no regrets
about buying this one it would totally
repurchase again so next up I have a
highlighter that I don't
of buying this is from Jessamine Hill
and Becca cosmetics this is a champagne
pop I can't actually open this one it's
broken so it was like bus everywhere
which is so very sad but I love this
highlighter I bought it when it first
came out to like support Jacqueline Hill
I was super excited about it Jacqueline
Hills one of my favorite youtubers and I
love this highlight I wear it so often
it is so beautiful no regrets about
purchasing champagne pop and then to
kind of go along with that I really
don't have regrets about purchasing this
product it was I got a lot of hype when
it was coming out and I was like one of
the first people to order it I thought
Jocelyn hell talking about it on her
snapchat and it was released like only
so many were released and he had to go
to the support ask it was pure craziness
but I did it was more expensive but I
still did it that's how excited I was
it's the just until invested cosmetics
champagne glow face palette I believe
it's the correct title for it sometimes
I do feel bad sometimes using this or
talking about the products inside
because I don't think that you can get
the actual face palette anymore I think
it came back once again like we thought
it was fully sold out but then it came
back but I think it's sold out again for
sure this time but one of the reasons I
don't feel so bad is because you can get
a lot of the shades individually inside
so you have two highlighters in here and
then three blushes and this one is
champagne pop and you can get champagne
pop on its own Prosecco pop you could
get in a split pan but it came out with
split pans which one sided highlight one
side is blush and Prosecco pop is in
those split pans and also Prosecco pop
is coming back in stock by itself as a
single highlighter and the makeup world
is very confused I'm very confused
because Prosecco pop was another
collaboration I mean this whole thing
was a collaboration which hasn't held
her name is on this her photos on the
box and she kind of was saying how she
came up with Prosecco pop and it's like
a little sister to champagne pop but now
about just releasing 4-cycle pop
appearing on its own we don't haven't
seen anything about jacqueline my guys
are so anything jacqueline hasn't said
anything everyone's very confused
there's a lot of speculation of what
could have happened if I could drop
jacqueline to Jackson
I guess I don't know but I'm confused
and I hope somebody does tell us just
because we're all kind of like over here
wondering what happened and the Prosecco
pop is coming back I don't have an exact
date yet but it is coming back as a
single highlighter and then you have the
three blushes up here honestly I love
the two highlights on this on I love
that I have a champagne pop that isn't
broken that's great for a cycle top I
absolutely fall in love with the gold
highlight and I really didn't know if I
would be much of a gold highlight type
of girl until I used Prosecco pop and
then I realized how much I love gold
highlights so that was interesting no
because I really didn't know if the glow
of highlight would look good on me and I
think that it does but I also really
enjoyed these blushes these two in
particular this is rose i spritz and
this is amaretto I don't use
Pamplemousse a ton because it's just too
bright when I'm tanner
I can get away with it like right now I
am not getting away with it but these
two I absolutely loved amaretto I
especially found them up with it's such
a great neutral blush and I didn't
realize I was missing a neutral blush
from my collection and I was and now
amaretto has my heart rose ice present
super pretty as well it's like a peachy
pink sparkly shimmer type of blush it's
beautiful especially in the spring and
summer I'm obsessed with it but overall
this palette has made me so happy again
you can get a lot of these at single
product or you can get the split pans as
well I think champagne pop is in a split
pan also I was super happy with this it
was $54 and I was really nervous about
ordering it it was kind of one of those
things like oh my gosh it ordered right
now it's for sale right now go safar app
right now you guys just right now like
boots like oh man you know if you're not
on it within five minutes going to sell
out and then who knows when he'll be
able to get it so it was one of those
like reaction type of things and I was
like man should I have done that but I
seriously I have I have no regrets about
purchasing this I love it and I have
definitely put it to use and then some
lip products that I have this is the
hardest for me and I was really trying
to narrow it down the best that I could
but these I I feel like were purses that
I wasn't sure about making and I worried
about regretting the purchase decision
and I didn't so that's what I'm going to
share with you first I'm going to share
in a set that I got this is from huda
beauty when would it be
came out the lipsticks I thought a lot
of people got really excited about it
and I was kind of like I don't know even
though I'm such a lipstick junkie I
don't know why I didn't get on the train
right away I have the hooded Beauty
eyelashes and Samantha's are some of my
favorites I just love them so it wasn't
like I'd never purchased from the brand
before but for some reason I was
hesitant about it
I worried about doing it it was $20 for
a liquid lipstick which is you know
definitely a higher-end purchase I just
I just didn't do it right away but then
she came out with these sets and I was
like okay I'm going to do it but says
came was too many liquid lipsticks and
then also a full-size lip liner and it
was $24 for everything
I'm someone who I do not mind buying
mini products because it's so hard to go
through makeup oh when I saw this I was
like perfect I can try it out I can see
what I think I even get a lip liner like
I don't use the liner's a ton but this
is actually really really good it's very
very creamy the lip liner is in trend
Center and then the two liquid lipsticks
this one is in trendsetter and then this
one is in bombshell and I love them both
I talked about in my best of beauty 2016
video I put them in my best of beauty
2016 giveaway because that was how
excited I was about these and I saw that
these did comes back they sold out for a
while at Sephora and I was like that's
the saddest thing ever and then they
came back so if they're in stock begin
right now I will leave a link down below
but if you haven't tried this hutu
Beauty lipstick I definitely recommend
pick up one of the sets
give them a try you'll get two lipsticks
and I just think it's such a good value
either ones that I worried about you
know maybe I would regret maybe I
wouldn't love but I have no regrets
about these other look item that I have
to share with one that I was so worried
about I wanted to buy a for so long and
I heard so many people talk about it and
Jaclyn hill hype this product up so much
so worried about this one because I was
going to be paying $28 for a lip gloss
and I was like can I really do that if I
complain that a little it looks too good
twenty dollars how can I pay $28 for a
lip gloss but I did it during the
Sephora vib sale I picked up Marc Jacobs
sugar sugar and you have no idea how
excited I am to be putting it in my
products I don't
gratifying video I am so happy that that
worked out well so yes I am super happy
that I got this I wear it so often I
wear it by itself I wear it on top of
lipsticks and growing on top of liquid
lipsticks it comes travelling with me it
always seems to find its way into my
purse
I'm so happy you guys because that was a
lot of money to pay for lip gloss I
definitely would say if you can have
some sort of coupon or discount code
like during the Sephora vib sale you get
your 20% off your 15% off whatever it is
that they're having like Holly wait
until there is a sale or discount just
because it's a lot of money for a lip
gloss but if you love lip gloss you wear
all the time
you love Marc Jacobs you probably don't
even need a discount because you'll
probably like use the crap out of it for
someone who like I don't wear a lip
gloss a ton a ton of this one I really
do love I do not regret purchasing this
one even with a high price tag I still
love the Marc Jacobs sugar sugar okay
and then I'm going to end this with eye
shadow pellet so one that I absolutely
love don't regret buying this is from
Tarte cosmetics and styled by her Roush
it is the cheek and eye palette so
inside it's six eyeshadows and then one
big blush you also have a mirror as well
this was $30 I didn't think it was a bad
price it's definitely a smaller palette
I like the pan sizes even the eyeshadow
pan sizes are really large and then
that's a very big blush I love all the
shades in here I have used the crap out
of this palette I travel with it because
it travels so well and it has the mirror
but takes small enough I was so happy
with this and I really wasn't sure if I
should get it I wasn't super familiar
with styled by faroush and like I wasn't
buying it for the collab just like the
actual palette intrigued me I wasn't
sure about it what has attend but I
picked it up and I absolutely loved it
this is one that I'm also glad to be
putting in this video because this
palette had so much hype around it so
much hype around it it is the Too Faced
sweet peach palette
this is one that has so much hype I
tried to get it online I couldn't and I
drove to my Ulta and 10 a.m. when they
opened I was waiting outside
ready to run in there with like ten
other women we all went straight to the
toothpaste section and grabbed out our
sweet peach palates I did it and you
know what I'm fine with it
I don't regret it I love this palette I
use it so often when it was out of stock
I was so sad because I was trying to
really only use it on the day so I
wasn't gonna be on camera are living in
the film any tutorial or where like
people weren't going to ask me what was
on my eyes because I felt so bad about
using it because I knew so many people
didn't get it
I'm really glad the peach palette is
back I know there was some controversy
about the re-release I'm not exactly a
hundred percent sure myself what
happened because I didn't I wasn't
trying to get it because I already had
it so I I don't I don't really know what
happened if you guys watched my will i
buy videos you know that I'm not
two-faced biggest fan right now doesn't
mean I'm not going to talk about a
palette that I absolutely love because
that's not what I'm about I love this
palette I use it all the time it smells
good I would do I smells but all of
these like Browns and neutrals the
shimmer shades in here are beautiful I
love these pink shades this green shade
is like I love it so much really I'm
happy that I bought it I do recommend it
a lot still even though like I said I
know I'm not a huge supporter of to face
right now I feel like they got some
weird things going on in there but this
is still palette that I recommend and
that I use very often so another
eyeshadow palette this one is not a new
palette but it's still one that I reach
for so often and I recommend so often
this is the Kat Von D shade + light eye
palette I love this palette and this was
one of like my first like bigger
eyeshadow palette purchases and I
remember being kind of nervous about it
like because I think it's $49 which that
was expensive to me especially when I
was asserting Alice makeup I didn't
purchase a ton of high-end before I had
my youtube channel and definitely
youtubers helps convince me to purchase
some more high-end products that's for
sure and I remember being a little bit
nervous about it especially because when
I looked at it I was like how many
different looks can you make out of this
because the shades do seem very similar
to one another but I reach for this all
the time there's not a shade in this
eyeshadow palette that I will not use
you know in every eyeshadow palette like
the Too Faced palette
like three to four shades in there's
that I've never touched that I don't
like don't like every single shade I use
every single shade I am so happy with
this palette it is come traveling with
me I still use it all the time even
though the I new palette and sometimes
we you know only use the new like pretty
shiny fancy things now I still reach for
this one all the time the shade + light
eye palette from Kat Von D if you've
liked ever been on the fence about
getting it I highly recommend it no
aggress and then the last palette that I
have to share is the modern renaissance
palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills
this was another one that was in so many
favorites videos from the best of beauty
2016 and I get it
I did not purchase this when it first
came out I have honest obvious single
shadows and I like to be honest I don't
think there's that great Joseon
a lot of people really hyper shadows and
from the single shadows that I've
purchased I think they're good but it's
nothing I lost my panties over I know
where my Fanny's are so when she was
coming out with eyeshadow palettes I
just really wasn't pulling the trigger
on him I wasn't I wasn't taking the bait
and everyone started going crazy about
this modern Renaissance and I was like
oh okay and then it sold out everywhere
and I was like whatever and then it came
back in the more I watched review videos
especially from like my friends on
YouTube people that I really do trust
their opinions and everybody was saying
how fabulous it was I was like oh I
think I missed out I think I missed out
on something what have I done
and when it finally came back in stock I
think it was around the Sephora be a
detail time because I'm fairly confident
I got it in the VI D cell and I couldn't
believe that I did because I was only a
vib still not like a VIP route so I
couldn't shop first I was like for sure
it's going to sell out when they ones of
the Ivy Rouge is shopping but it didn't
and I still got it and I do not regret
it
these shadows in here I'm so impressed
with like the shimmer shade are gorgeous
the shimmer shade I have a lot of
trouble with fallout that I posted a
bloopers video on my Instagram every
once while I post bloopers over on
Instagram and you see a huge chunk of
fallout on my face from using some of
the unsightly shadows but I don't get it
with this power
and I know some people have actually
told me that they feel like this palette
has a lot of Fallout and mine does not
like I there's yes sir fall up I'm not
saying there's no follow-up no no I'm
not saying that there definitely is
fallout but it is nothing like what I
experienced with the Anasazi single
shadows I think these shadows are so
much better than the single you how does
that I have I don't know what it is
about this palette but I just think it
is the bomb diggity
I love the oranges in here I love the
pinks I love the shimmer shades huh I
just love this palette I really do I
love it I think it's fantastic I have no
regrets about buying it only regret that
I have with it is that I didn't purchase
it in the first round and then I missed
out on it and I had a waist long long to
get it but I definitely have no regrets
about pursuing this one of my favorite
eyeshadow palettes okay so that's going
to be everything for my makeup that I
don't regret buying video I hope that
