today's video is going to be all about
makeup products that I do not regret
buying I used to be so good at posting
for my regret series I have a playlist
I will leave link down below and I am
medical for myself for 2018 to get back
to my regret playlist so get ready for
some videos talking about products I
don't regret buying I do regret buying I
don't regret not buy etc so today's
video we are gonna be chatting about
makeup products that I bought that I do
not have any regrets about buying so if
you are interested in seeing what those
products are why don't we go ahead and
get started
of course these are gonna be all
products I bought myself and I do have
my mixture of drugstore and high-end the
first one is a foundation this is the
Dior forever foundation they do your
skin forever foundation I always forget
that name wrong always this is a $52
foundation so it is pretty pricey I did
purchase it during the Sephora vib sale
which I'm happy about I'm glad that I
was able to get that 20% discount but
honestly if I spent $52 on it I still
would be just as happy this is a bond
foundation I feel like I saw this
mentioned quite a bit too in best of
2017 videos a lot of people mentioned
this foundation I've mentioned this
foundation and it really is just
fantastic I do post makeup photos on my
Instagram you know every day every other
day or whatnot and there was a time or
like three photos in a row I was saying
I always listen to makeup I'm wearing
and it was always the Dior forever skin
foundation I'm like how many days in a
row did I wear that foundation like you
really kind of mix it up girl you have
other foundations so yeah that really
tells me that I love this foundation it
goes traveling with me again it's a
higher price tag if you can get a
discount I think that's amazing but
honestly I do think this is worth the
$52 and I would totally go on to
repurchase this one it's nice packaging
my shade is zero three zero it's a
really nice medium to full coverage
foundation but it just looks really nice
on the skin really enjoy this one the
next items that I want to talk about
that I do not regret buying these are a
little bit higher price as well but
these are eyeshadow palettes from dose
of colors the first one that I purchased
was this one in marvelous mobs and I
have gone on to give this palette so
much love again I've mentioned this in
my
best of beauty 2017 video if you can
actually see the shades here so this is
the mauve tone eyeshadow palette and I
think it's amazing I love the shades
they're very pigmented very easy to
blend and then I recently went on and
purchased the sassy cns palette this is
a new one from dose of colors I've been
wearing this on my eyes a lot lately I
did a tutorial with it in my Ulta haul
and Tryon video I will have that line
that linked below as well if you want to
see how I created a look with this
palette
they are $32 and you only do get five
shades in there so I think that they are
a little bit pricey but I do think again
that they are worth of the price tag I
will continue to purchase the dose of
colors actually pellets and I really do
highly recommend them I have more like I
want all of them I know they have the
baked brown eyeshadow palette and then
also the berry one I believe is the one
that just came out on with sassy
Sienna's I really want them out there a
little bit more pricey so I can't buy it
like all at once but really really happy
with those I have some skincare here
that I wanted to chat about because I've
gone on to fall in love with this brand
of course I'm talking about little
Hendrickson that purchased a skincare
like sample set from Sephora I think it
was 250 points and I was like well wait
a second like I love this skincare I
actually repurchase to that sample pack
from Sephora again and was like okay
nope wasn't a one-off still really enjoy
the skincare I purchased a set it came
with three scrubs it was called the
three glowing scrubs it was around
holiday time so I'm not sure if it's
still available if it is I will leave it
link down below
I just finished off this product which
is the pore balance a facial sauna scrub
I have another scrub that I just put
into my shower and then the third one is
the transforming walnut scrub so this is
what will go in last but I am using
these scrubs up completely I definitely
wanted to purchase a full-size of this
one because I love it I have it saved in
my loves list if you guys want to see a
video I'm like maybe what's on my
Sephora love's list please do let me
know I've been thinking about doing that
one but I wasn't sure if people would be
interested in seeing it but newsflash
this one is on my Sephora love's list so
Lula Hendrickson I mean they have a lot
of different skincare sets as well and I
personally love purchasing sets I like
getting kind of minis of skincare
especially to see if it does work for
you as
they are you know on the higher-priced
side it's nice to be able to test that
out but I've been really impressed
they've also sent me some products
recently which was so freakin cool like
so cool to get and I have not found a
product yet that I don't like from Lula
Hendrickson I'm sure that there's one
out there and I'm sure I'll probably
find one but so far with everything that
I've been trying I've been very
impressed so I definitely do not regret
I think it was only like 25 dollars for
the three different strobes do not
regret that purchase though at all and
next up I do have a palette here this is
from Becca cosmetics this is the
appraised ski glow face palette I'm
always for sure that I'm saying it like
out of order but this is the face
palette from Becca this came out around
holiday time do you get highlight shades
blush shades a bronzer and I reach for
this palette so much I I do not hit pan
on my products a lot because I'm super
super light handed but honestly I have
to say that I am shocked to have not hit
pan on that bronzer because I go to that
bronzer so freaking often it is kind of
ridiculous love this palette again took
a traveling with me over the holiday
time I did pay $54 for it because I
wanted it right when it came out and I
was kind of bummed to see like two or
three weeks or something within it
coming out it got reduced in price to
like the $44 I was like oh that kind of
stings but still I'm still happy with it
at the $54 I I would still pay fifty
four dollars for this palette I've
gotten a ton of use out of it and I
enjoy every single shade in here every
single shade I make work for me which i
think is amazing so I don't regret
paying the $54 for it of course it's
always nice to get things a little bit
of a cheaper price but still mmm not mad
about this one I do have a more
affordable product here this one is from
a color pop and it's the alessia's magic
palette I really really like this
palette if you have been considering
getting a color pop pressed eyeshadow
palette I really do recommend this one I
did a video recently on underwhelming
makeup products and I actually mentioned
the color pop and kathleenlights Dream
Street palette you know I still said
that I liked it and I enjoyed it but I
bought these two palettes fairly close
to one another this one I think I only
purchased like two or three weeks before
the dream streak came out and when
people asked which one I recommend more
I recommend all I see is magic
this one might be this one might be my
favorite color palette palette I have
the yes please palette which I do enjoy
don't get me wrong I enjoy that one but
again I like this one more I have two
palettes in the I love Sarah II
collection which I do like those you
only get four shades and those but I
like the shade selections
I like those but if you're looking for
something with a little bit more options
I would still recommend this one and
then again I have another just little
floor pan palette from colour-pop I'm
gonna go ahead and say that this one is
my favorite color pop pressed eyeshadow
palette so far as the all I see is magic
it is $20 pallets kind of range of price
from like 10 12 16 20 dollars this one
is 20 you can get it on the colour-pop
website it should still be available it
was the last time I checked so I will
have it linked down below but I just
really enjoy all of the shades in here
and I like that I can create different
looks like it's not too sometimes in
palettes are just too monochromatic I
just feel super limited in what I can do
and when I reach into this one I know
that I can get creative if I want to I
know I can do something a little bit
different if I want to but I can also do
something more neutral at the same time
so I reach into this one so much again
it was $20 but I do not regret this one
at all and this one like I said might be
my favorite color palette pressed
eyeshadow palette so if I have another
item that I purchased during the V I V
sale and I hear these recommended a lot
and I decided to go for it and your girl
doesn't regret it and how she's not
going back to another facial cotton
because these are Shiseido a facial
cotton but it's a bomb I don't know what
else to say I saw everybody recommending
this and there's a four vib
recommendations video I hear people talk
about this all the time and everyone's
like this was the only facial cotton I'd
use and I'm like yeah slightly dramatic
but okay and now I'm like this is the
only facial cotton I'm going to use so
ashtec dramatic over here these are
fantastic I really do enjoy them 165
sheets and I believe this one was $10
and then I had the 20% off which I
personally do not feel like that is a
bad price at all it's literally just I
Square Oh cotton I mean it's like one of
the most unexpected things ever but I
have a zero zero regrets about buying
this one I love it to remove makeup I
love that make
remover I like to use a lot of cleansing
oils to remove my makeup and sometimes
with regular cotton rounds the the
cleanser just kind of sinks into the
cotton and then I feel like I'm having
to put a lot of product on this does not
sink into the cotton you can actually
see when I put the cleanser on it like
it sits on top of the cotton so the
makeup remover is actually removing my
makeup it's not just getting soaked into
the cotton round I also love that none
of the fibers come off I feel like I can
get right up into my eyes I can get
right underneath my lashes to remove
mascara and I can do it without with
knowing that little cotton fibers are
not going into my eyes because that
happens a lot and a lot of times with
cleansing oils I was finding myself just
using my fingers so I could get in there
for my lashes my liner my lash adhesive
if you guys don't know I I don't like
having makeup on my fingers I don't like
using my hands to remove my makeup I
want to use something like this but I
always hate it using the regular cotton
grounds for that reason you'd have
fibers on your face it would just be
annoying I also use this a tube remove
my nail polish and I think it's balm
because again that it actually removes
the nail polish instead of just sinking
in I don't have to use double the amount
of nail polish remover for my nails and
again you don't get any fibers stuck to
your nails because then it's like you're
not only trying to remove your nail
polish but then you're also trying to
remove the cotton that is now stuck in
your nails I think these are fantastic I
don't think people are crazy when they
talk about how good the Shiseido's
facial Cotton's are and yeah no regrets
over here I have a liquid lipstick this
is also from colour-pop it is in a
collaboration with I love Sarah E and it
is the arriba ultra matte liquid
lipstick the reason I wanted to include
this one is because I have gone on the
record saying that I do not love the
colour-pop ultra matte liquid lipsticks
and I still entirely stand behind that
I've talked about them in several videos
mostly because I do not think that they
last a long time as if you're someone
with a big lipstick collection like me
you are not going to get a lot of shelf
life out of these the formula seems to
go bad very quickly so I have to kind of
continuously be declaring my Claire Papa
lipsticks because I know after a few
months they've gone bad and it's not
worth it but I do not regret buying this
one because I am obsessed with this
color I love this red I'm not a big red
lipstick person you guys know I'm
where my neutral lipstick shades and
those are just my favorites but every
once in a while every once in a while
I'll step outside of that comfort zone
and I will go for red and this is
definitely my new go-to red to me it is
just it's just beautiful it looks so
good on the lips the ultra matte
lipsticks do last a long time I not the
most comfortable a liquid lipstick
because they are a little bit on the
drying side but they are also pretty
affordable I believe these are six
dollars I think I actually only paid
four dollars so I mean definitely for
the four dollars I don't regret it but
it's not even necessarily money-wise
that I'm saying that's why I don't
regret buying it but it's because the
ultra matte aren't necessarily my
favorite I just love this color so much
and I think it looks really flattering
on so colour-pop I love Sarah II love
the color next up I have two of brow
products to talk about I did review
these fairly recently but I wanted to
touch on them and say like maybe why I
am putting them in what I don't regret
buying that is the color pop precision
and brow pencil and then also the
Maybelline at total temptation of brow
pencil really affordable the color pop I
believe is $5 and the Maybelline is like
$7.99 and one thing that I will say is
what I kind of worried about when I
purchased both of these is that I
haven't always had the best of luck with
drugstore brow pencils and when I was
first trying to get into brows if you've
been following me for a while you know
it's been a journey but when I was first
trying to get into brows I was buying
drugstore brow products because I'm like
you know I'm still trying to figure it
out I don't want to spend a lot of money
yet on brow pencils when I'm just not
really sure if I'm doing I basically
need something to practice on and I was
having the worst time and I kept
thinking like well obviously it's me
because you know I don't know what I'm
doing and I would watch the tutorials
and then I finally one day bit the
bullet and purchased the goof proof from
a benefit cosmetics was the first bra
product that I purchased from benefit
and I started practicing with that one
and I was like well wait a second I can
do this and I went on and purchased but
precisely my brow and benefit and love
that one too so then I was like oh no I
can only purchase high-end brow pencils
that sucks because I was thinking you
know I tried so hard with so many
different brands even Maybelline was one
of them I had a Maybelline brow product
I had the NYX brow pencil and I just
could not get it so I truly thought like
a drugstore brow pencils don't work for
me
only use high-end ones and the benefit
route products are you know in the $20
range it's expensive and if you do your
brows every single day like I do because
I film almost every single day you're
going through brow pencils pretty
quickly and I was like oh man I'm gonna
have to start spending so much money on
brow products so that's kind of why it
like the little story that I wanted to
mention what these because yes they're
affordable and I wouldn't have been out
a ton of money if they didn't work for
me but I'm really glad that they did
because it kind of showed me that I can
also find good drugstore Brattle
products so I would love to know if you
have a favorite affordable brow product
leave it down below I think a lot of
people recommend the Revlon wanted to me
now I can't remember revlon or l'oreal I
did try both of these the colour-pop one
I highly do recommend I actually like
the Maybelline one even more it's a
couple dollars more expensive but if you
have like an Ulta coupon it would
probably probably be the same a price
this one reminds me of the benefit goof
proof this one reminds me of the benefit
precisely my brow so I do not regret
buying these and it makes me really
happy I mean I also do think that I I
was getting better at doing my brows I
mean I think that also had something to
do with it and after I was kind of
getting the hang of things I went back
to both the Maybelline and the NYX one
that I had been using and I still just
couldn't with those I just don't think
that those are good products but I'm
glad that I was able to find some
affordable ones that makes me really
happy so that's what I wanted to include
those in this video and share that
little story and then the last item of
that I have here is from Tarte and this
is the pearly girl teeth whitening pen
let me tell you it's been a journey with
this guy because when I first got it I I
didn't really like it and not that I
disliked it or not but I thought I
didn't work I had in mind I had
something different in mind that I
thought this product was and from
reading the reviews I felt like I wasn't
getting out of it what other people were
getting out of it it's 22 dollars I
purchased it from Sephora and I thought
that this was going to be a product that
basically just kind of always kept your
teeth whiter and I truly now that I've
tried different teeth whitening products
and pencils and pens and whatever that
pencils but pens and all of that I don't
think that there is a product out there
like that I do think that you have to
use some sort of teeth whitener on a
very very consistent basis in or
keep your teeth white and I feel like
maybe that's a really obvious thing to
say but I didn't know that for a very
long time I thought that I truly could
use a product for you know two weeks or
a month at a time and then my teeth
would be white for a month and then you
know I would come in and whiten them
again they'd be weight from that doesn't
really happen with this one when I use
it I do notice results I do think it
works I do think it makes your teeth
whiter but for like a day maybe two and
so I was kind of like well that's really
frustrating like you would have to use
this if you use it every single day I
feel like it does make really good
results but I'm like ever seen look
that's a lot of work that's a lot of
product it's $22 you're gonna have to
consistently be buying this like I don't
know if that's really worth it what I
have realized what I enjoyed this for is
almost like I want to say like a spot
treatment almost but like every other
day or so every two days I like I will
put this on like an hour or two before I
film a YouTube video if I feel like
maybe my teeth aren't looking the white
is up maybe I'm wearing a lipstick that
kind of yellows off the teeth a little
bit I'll go ahead and pop this on and I
can see a result very very quickly if
I'm going on a vacation somewhere or
something like that like when we went
out of town traveling for the holidays
and we were gonna be gone for a while I
brought this and I pop up would pop it
on in the morning like after I brush my
teeth and boom like it does make your
teeth whiter but it does fade very
quickly so if you're someone maybe like
me who you know I don't need the most
blinding whitest teeth every single day
if I had that that would be fantastic
but I like kind of having just that
little kind of like touch-up every now
and then every couple days or so I can
come in and use this and it will make my
teeth really white it does just fade
quickly so it kind of depends on you and
what you need for your teeth whitening
needs but once I realized that and maybe
I stopped being so hard on this product
I was like okay now I'm not mad at it
and now I have it in my love list again
and I would repurchase it again so
there's that but this is what the
product looks like so it just has these
soft bristles here and you twist the
bottom and the product will come out and
you basically just paint your teeth with
it you don't have to rinse or anything
like that I don't necessarily like
absolutely love the taste of it it's
minty but like with a strange little
like after effect kind of but I really
don't
find it I put it on and then I just kind
of like do this for I don't know 45
seconds maybe and then if I close my
mouth and do like one big swallow the
taste goes away that's the best way that
I have fun to do it but I like the
results that it gives I just had to
realize that it's not like a miracle
teeth whitening product whichever I
truly don't believe there's that's out
there but once I kind of realized that I
do really enjoyed this product now I
don't regret buying it and I would
repurchase it has anybody tried the
Tarte um what's the call pearly girl
teeth whitening pen it does have really
great reviews on it and that's why I
purchased it I think it's good as a
touch-up treatment I'd love to know if
anyone else tried it but after that
those are all the products that I've
purchased recently that I did not regret
buying and that is everything for
today's video about the makeup products
that I do not regret buying I would love
to know some of yours and down below
what have you purchased recently that
you're like you know what
whether it be affordable or high-end you
do not regret making that purchase I
would love to know or if we have
anything in common I would also love to

more videos in my regret series again
