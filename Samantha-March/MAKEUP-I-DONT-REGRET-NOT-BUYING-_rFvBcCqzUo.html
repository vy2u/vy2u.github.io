today's video is hopefully going to be a
fun one it is going to be all on makeup
products that I did not buy and that I
do not regret not buying so basically
just talking about makeup products that
I decided to pass over you know some of
these I kind of did double take like
should I buy them should I not but
ultimately I decided not to make these
makeup purchases and now I do not regret
it either seeing like you know the
reviews coming in the feedback coming in
or just seeing not a lot about these
projects and understanding that that
means that they probably were not great
and I probably was better off not
purchasing them I got the idea when the
other night I was chatting with a friend
on snapchat she purchased a palette that
I'll be talking about in this video she
said she was super disappointed in it
not very happy with it at all what she
could return it I was like man I almost
bought that house myself I'm so glad
that I decided not to buy it and I was
like hey that could be a video ideas not
saying this is an original video because
it's very hard to be original these days
on YouTube but it was a just something
that popped in my head and I thought I
can make a video of that but I'm excited
to share what I do not regret not buying
so if you are new to my channel welcome
I post videos four times a week on
Wednesdays I have my will i buy it
series and then I also post on Thursday
Sundays and Mondays so I hope that you
will hit the subscribe button if you
want to become a part of the family of
the Bell to get notifications when I
post videos I know a lot of you guys are
commenting and sending me in snapchat
saying that you're not getting
notifications for my videos YouTube is
changing up how they do things so now
you have to that little build next to
the subscribe button I know it's
ridiculous and annoying I am with you
but yes if you would like to see the
makeup products that I don't regret not
buying please keep watching okay so the
first one that I want to talk about is
the Too Faced and a Kat Von D collab a
single is called the butter together
collab so I actually featured this and I
will I buy it
back when the the collab looks first and
now until we first got the peak in the
palette and I talked to my will I buy a
video about how I was really interested
in getting it I was really considering
it big supporter of Kat Von D I really
like two-faced etc etc and then by the
time
the collab actually came out my feelings
had definitely changed I actually
featured it in another wilayat video and
I said that I was going to be passing
over the palette the prices have been
released I thought it was too expensive
but it also had a very bad experience
with a two-faced palette the white
chocolate chip pellet all these my
videos listed down below in case you're
interested in seeing them but I was
still very still feeling very salty
towards Too Faced and I wasn't I wasn't
really very committed to purchasing
something new from them and I have to
say that I don't regret not buying this
I'm mostly talking about the eyeshadow
palette they had like some extras in
there as well but I'm focusing this one
on the eyeshadow palette the main reason
why I'm glad I didn't buy it
it was just expensive to me I remember
the purse off the top of my head but I
want to say it was like $60 or something
like that it just it seems too expensive
for a palette it did come with other
things as well it wasn't just an
eyeshadow palette that was that cost but
still overall it just seemed to be like
too much money for me and I have the
extras that came with it that super
eyeliner and the better than sex mascara
so those weren't necessary for me to pay
extra money for if you get with the
palette but another reason why I'm glad
is because I just really haven't heard
great things but I also haven't really
heard much about this palek and kind of
with the bigger youtubers if they don't
like something typically they just don't
talk about it they don't do tutorials
with it you don't see it in favorites
video if you don't see them just
bringing it up in their videos anyways
and I have not seen a lot of people talk
about this I have some people on
snapchat and I'm not saying everybody
here because I have had people of touch
si hey I really like that palette I
really liked the shade or that shade or
whatever it is I've made some nice look
so I'm definitely not saying everybody
didn't like the palette or nobody liked
the palette I don't want you to think
that but the majority of people
especially on my snapchat you know my
friends people who I like to listen to
their opinions and see what they're
thinking about they were saying that
they thought the palette was a bit of a
busses while the thinking about what
they were saying to me and then thinking
about just the lack that I've seen of it
in the YouTube world makes me think that
it probably wasn't a super good talent
there's also been a lot of controversy
the surrounding two-faced and after the
situation that I had with the white
chocolate chip palette I just and then
there's like the peach palette weirdness
that happened I don't know I'm just
feeling a little uneasy with two-face
lately so I'm actually really glad that
I decided to pass over that collection I
didn't think I needed it and I'm still
I'm still staying firm in that decision
that I think it was the right one and
not to purchase the two-face and Kat Von
D collection let us know in the comments
down below did you pick this up
do you regret buying it do you not
regret buying it was a good purchase for
you I'm curious as always to hear your
thoughts as if my lighting is weird like
I only have one light setup because it's
kind of funny but I think maybe I should
pull the other light but I'm not sure
we're just I'm trying to make it work
for a little bit here but in case my
lighting is office because the weather
outside is doing very strange things its
January in Iowa one day is 50 degrees
the next day it's negative for like we
doesn't no idea what's going on over
here no idea so the next one that I want
to talk about is the Mariah Carey in Mac
collection so I did a whole will I buy
up video on this collection and went
over each item in the collection and
what I thought about it and if I'd be
purchasing or not and I said that I
wasn't going to purchase anything from
the collection like there was definitely
certain things that caught my eye more
than others some that I knew right away
that I wasn't going to purchase but I
just knew that I wasn't going to
purchase anything from the Mariah Carey
and matte collection some of the biggest
reasons is because I do not purchase
from Mac alot I'm just not drawn to the
brand I've had issues with the customer
service and different experiences in the
past was buying from Maxx and so they're
just not really on the top of my list to
purchase from I'm also not like a huge
Mariah Carey supporter like I appreciate
her music I think she's a bomb singer
but she's not someone that I'm like
clamoring out there to get a collab from
all of it was pretty pricey in my
opinion and I did think a lot of the
shades were for me like even like the
lipstick shades wasn't for me there was
a bronzer that totally would not be for
me like there was like this shimmery
highlight powder glitter thing I don't
even know what it was called anymore and
that like looked cool but like in theory
it's something that I've never wear so
it just wasn't really a collection for
me and again I
have no regrets about not purchasing
anything from this collection it's so
interesting because again it's like the
people that I know that have purchased
from them either if they didn't like it
it turned out that they didn't love the
shades of it or they didn't trust the
formulas of it or just so many people
are like I don't want to use it because
the packaging is so pretty and it was so
expensive like people are like I'm just
using it as decor decoration and I feel
guilty using it I'm like I'm going to
buy makeup and you did that's what I'm
going to spend my money on like I'm not
just going to let something sit there
and then once again I just and not see
it really talked about no one's really
no one's really mentioning it at all and
video I don't think I've seen anything
of Mariah Carey's collection in a
favorites video and again of course I'm
not saying everybody didn't like it
nobody don't like it I hate when I see
the comments that are like well I like
you I liked it yes I know I'm not saying
that everybody loves something I hate
something because that's just not
realistic I also don't watch every
single youtuber that there is out there
maybe there's someone that I don't watch
on the regular that did love it but I'm
just saying out of everybody that I
watch I watch a lot of different
youtubers i watch a lot of youtube
videos in the day YouTube is my TV I
don't watch TV I watch YouTube and I
haven't seen anything about the
collection I very rarely have seen it
used in tutorials I've seen a few like a
lipstick shade here and there but like
the eyeshadow palette I haven't seen
anyone talk about I haven't seen anyone
putting that glitter powder dust all
over their body I haven't really seen
anything about it so definitely not
regret of mine glad I was able to save
some money and not purchase from a brand
that I don't particularly love so let us
know in the comments down below did you
get anything from the Mariah Carey
collection have you been using it do you
love it do you regret it do you not let
us know in the comments down below the
next item that I want to talk about is
the huda beauty eyeshadow palette this
was like a rose gold texture eyeshadow
palette I believe it was the first Idol
shadow palette that huda beauty was
launching so this palette it caught my
eye right away because it's beautiful
like the shades and side looks beautiful
the shimmers look - beautiful is a
really large
I thought it looked really cool it was
$65 which was like an immediate red flag
to me I talked about my voice video said
I'm not an eyeshadow Jett eyeshadow
palette junkie so sometimes it's harder
for me to justify spending so much money
on eyeshadow palettes when I just feel
like those kinds of things that give me
super excited in my makeup collection
I'd much rather prefer to like buy
lipsticks and things like that so so the
price definitely was hard for me and
then also because it was the first
eyeshadow palette I was like oh you know
I don't know how is it going to be how
is the quality going to be and so when
the review is started coming in I will
say that I think this palette has super
mixed reviews I have seen people that
absolutely love this palette I've seen
it in favorites videos I've seen it in
tutorial after tutorial and I've seen
this in a disappointing makeup product
makeup that I regret purchasing you know
people just completely hate on the
palette I know people have returned the
palette to Sephora so I have seen a very
mixed end of the spectrums versus like
the first two that I talked about that
you that I personally didn't really see
a lot of people talking about or seeing
it mentioned I see this one mentioned a
lot for both good reasons and bad
reasons but what's interesting to me
like for the people that say that they
don't like it they say especially with
the shimmers but it's not nice to apply
with a brush like you really need to
apply with your finger and I hate
applying eyeshadows with my fingers I
talk about this in a lot of my videos
but that's why I don't use color pop
eyeshadows a lot there's super shock
shadows because you really do need to
apply them with your fingers versus a
brush and I have very long nails I want
to put my finger in an eyeshadow pan and
then I don't want to be jabbing myself
with my finger in out like it might
sound silly but I don't want to do that
I would rather play my eyeshadow with a
brush so especially when they were
saying those beautiful like foiled
shimmer shades really weren't doing it
with brushes I was like oh oh no I also
I heard a lot about what the actual
quality of the palette like the
packaging just seemed like very cheese
and like not very nice and for $65
people were you know expecting something
of a little bit nicer quality so there's
that so I just looked the so many mixed
reviews and what I heard
the shimmer shades and what I think like
even the people I've seen a lot of
videos where people are saying you know
I love this Todd I think it's great I
love using it you know these shadows are
my favorite is it worth $65 I don't
think so
I've heard a lot of people say that as
well and so that to me is like okay I'm
glad that I didn't go out and spend $65
on an eyeshadow palette that probably
would have been my most expensive
eyeshadow palette I'm like mentally
trying to review my palette I think that
would have been my most expensive
eyeshadow palette and I would have need
to like absolutely been in love with it
and I truly don't think that I would
have been this was out of stock for a
while to came back in stock and I
remember it coming back in stock and
everybody was all excited about it and I
was like nope I'm still not going to do
it I'm not going to do it and I don't
have regrets on not purchasing that so
I'm curious to know what category do you
fall in if you did purchase the huda
beauty eyeshadow palette do you love it
do you hate it are you somewhere in
between I didn't see a lot of
Inbetweeners it was either like totally
yes or totally no so I would love to
know if you guys got it or if you are
like me and you do not regret not
purchasing this one okay and the last
one I had to talk about is another
eyeshadow palette this one is pretty
newer it is the royal peach palette from
Kylie cosmetics this is actually the one
when I reference in the beginning of the
video that I was talking to a friend on
snapchat she was saying how much she
disliked the palette and she wished she
could return it this was the one that I
was like I almost bought that palette I
did mention it in a will I buy a video
and I was like yeah I think I'm going to
do it like if I'm on my computer at the
time that it launches I think that I'll
get it and I just so happened to not be
by my computer at the time of the launch
I started working out and I completely
forgot about it I remember doing my
workout coming back and I was looking on
my phone and also and all these snap
chats were coming in Samantha did you
get the palette I got the palette did
you get the palette I was like oops I
forgot about it and it was only like 20
minutes later after the launch I think
it was 5 o'clock my time I think was
5:20 that I loved and I was already sold
out I was like oh man I was actually
really going to get that one and I
I am pretty pretty glad that I didn't
again I've been watching the reviews
come in it is newer and people are like
slowly starting to get their palates but
kind of right off the bat I was like you
don't want
I'm actually not sad that I missed out
on that one you know maybe I forgot
about it and it was a higher power
telling me to forget about that palette
I don't think that you can return Kylie
cosmetics products I'm not for sure but
I don't think that there's a return
policy for them that's why I like to buy
it from Sephora and also because if you
don't love something you can return it
I'm not sure I'm saying that currently
though so feel free to correct me in the
comments down below if I'm wrong but I
know the gals loves talking to you on
snapchat was was saying I'm so mad that
I can't return itself I don't think you
can't return Kylie cosmetics but the
first thing that I've been seeing in
almost every single review look I was
into 98% of reviews if people are saying
that it smells awful like it smells like
pain and smell terrible there's a lot of
questions is did actual eyeshadows smell
it's just a box of smelling but
basically everybody is saying their eyes
shadow palette smells like paint like
spray paint one friend on Instagram that
was like I use it once I'm never going
to use it again because the smell is so
bad is irritating my eyes which makes me
think maybe it's the iron shadow but
immediately I was like oh no that's not
good that's very strange that's a
turn-off I haven't seen anything come
out as to why it smells like I haven't
seen Kylie like release anything because
it's just interesting because so many
people are saying that the palette
smells but I'm like is there any
explanation to why it smells I didn't
think anything else at first smelled I
never heard that before
and then I've been watching tutorials
I've been watching the swatch videos and
the shades look nice they really do it
doesn't look like a bad palette like
swatch wise or tutorial wise
it doesn't look like a bad palette but
as I was watching the swatches come in
and I'm seeing him I was like oh no no I
guess I don't really need that pellet
and you know it could be just because of
the whole smell thing like immediately
kind of threw me off but you know I've
been watching the tutorials and I'm like
I really don't feel like I missed out I
just don't and there have definitely
been
i shadow pellets that I've missed and I
didn't get maybe I should do the video
on that there's an actual pallets that
I've missed and that I didn't get and
then I watched the videos back and I'm
like no and that's already sold out and
it's never coming back in stock and I
didn't get it oh no and this one I was
just watching the videos like very
detached like oh well just a National
palette I missed it it's fine it's no
big deal like I didn't feel remorse not
getting it so I'm not okay whatever I
missed it that's fine it was $45 so you
know more of an expensive palette and if
it didn't work out for me or if I just
couldn't get over the smell or irritated
my eyes I wouldn't be able to return it
and then I would just be stuck with a
cord about dollar I should have palette
but I'm not going to use so I actually
don't regret not buying that one which
I'm so grateful on because when I saw
that I missed the launch I actually was
really bummed out and I was like I hope
it comes back soon maybe I can still get
it like yada yada and then I start
seeing the reviews coming in and people
just not being very happy with it and I
was made like soap never mind just going
to wash my hands of it and it never
happened and it's all good so I do not
regret not purchasing the Kylie Royal
Peach palette let us know in the
comments down below if you've got this
one does your smell can you get over the
smell and do you like the actual
eyeshadows inside I would love to know
your thoughts on the Kylie peach palette
as well yeah that's going to be
everything for the makeup products I
don't regret not buying I really hope

I was mostly talking about items that I
featured in my will I buy it so that
could definitely be something that I do
you know a couple months down the road
take what I thought maybe I was going to
buy them I will I buy it and that I
decided not to get for whatever reason
and then talk about if I regret them or
not I can also do a video of makeup
products that I regret not buying

head I have a couple in there that I
regret not buying that they're no longer
