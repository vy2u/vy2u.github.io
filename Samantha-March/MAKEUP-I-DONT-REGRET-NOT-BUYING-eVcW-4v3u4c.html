today's video is going to be all about
makeup products that I don't regret not
buying I do have a regret serious I will
have my playlist elicit down below where
I talk about makeup I regret buying
don't regret buying I regret not buying
and then I also talked about those
products that I decided not to purchase
for whatever reason and then I still
don't have any regrets about I'm totally
fine that that product is not in my
collection so I have some new products
here that I want to talk about that I do
not have regrets over not deciding to
purchase them so if you are ready for a
new regret video why don't we go ahead
and get started so first up on my list I
have this one from fenty it was from the
holiday collection I think it was the
galaxy palette I'll insert photos over
here since obviously I do not have any
of these but this was a pretty expensive
eyeshadow palette I believe it was like
$59 and it was like all shimmer shades
you know lid toppers things like that
and there was a lot of buzz around it a
lot of people seemed excited for it but
I was like you know what no not
interested
I don't gravitate towards all shimmer
palettes a ton I like something that has
a sprinkle of mattes in there as well or
an all matte palette but I don't
typically go for an all shimmer palette
and especially for something being that
expensive I was like no and I mean of
course there's always mixed reviews on
everything not everybody if only has one
opinion on a product but it seems like
that a lot of other people who are all
that impressed with it and I very rarely
like saw it being used especially now
but even then when it was coming out
like I would see it sprinkled in videos
here and there but it didn't really seem
like it went over all that well who will
purchase the galaxy pellet from Fendi
beauty why did you think about it do you
love it or were you like ooh maybe not
but for the price and knowing that I
wouldn't reach for it a ton I was able
to say no to it and then once I kind of
saw the feedback after it came out I was
like still a good decision it's still a
good decision Samantha so that's one
that I don't regret not having also on
my list I put the Maybelline and Gigi
Hadid collection this one definitely got
a lot of chatter when it was coming out
mostly because of you like obscene
prices that Maybelline was charging for
the Gigi Hadid collection bujji is a
model celebrity and I feel like that's
where the prices came from but it was
just kind of a bummer like way you know
even if someone is collaborating with a
brand like Maybelline that's the
drugstore brand that has more affordable
prices I was like I feel like it should
be like hey we're gonna keep the prices
affordable I don't I don't know I I was
not into a $30.00 eyeshadow pellet from
Maybelline just because they were
collabing with a model I thought that I
was pretty crap so I put it in a will I
might video and especially it came kind
of on the heels of the NYX in your
elements palette which I did purchase
and I put in a makeup I regret buying
video because I purchased that palette
at $30 and I was not impressed with it
and I was like you know what I'm not
doing it again like NYX had me sold on
those pallets because I truly thought
that they thought it was going to be
something really special and I was like
I'm not taking a chance of Maybelline
and once again this is something that
again of course there's mixed reviews
out there but for the most part people
are like 'no and it wasn't worth it it
wasn't worth the price tag so I'm glad
that I did not get sucked into the hype
of that one because I would have been
real angry what I have on my list is a
newer product this one is from Natasha
de Nonna it was called like the diamond
and glow the diamond and blush palette I
haven't pulled over my laptop
this was the $89 face palette that
Natasha came out with recently Natasha
tanana is known for her crazy crazy
price tags on her products but even at
$89 this was one that I was like do I
want this one but I know I said no I
talked myself out of it I was like no
you do not need this one that you do not
need an 89 color face palette Samantha
get it together
but then when I did start watching the
reviews of it again it was one that just
didn't seem to be getting a ton of good
reviews I was watching like a bunch of
people gathered in PR and I was watching
them and even even the long so we're
getting it in PR they were like trying
to say nice things about it but you
could tell that it just was not gonna be
worth at the eighty nine dollar price
tag
I did have powders in there and it also
had creams and I am NOT a big cream face
product girl blush highlight anything
like that so I was like no you
definitely do not need that palette but
after seeing the reviews and then after
it came
because it did it released recently and
it kind of got a little bit of buzz
especially in like PR and Hollings and
trying new makeup and then it's pretty
much died down haven't really heard
anybody talk about it so I'm like good
decision Samantha way to not purchase
that next up I have on here at the lorac
mega Pro 4 palette this is one that I
almost had myself talked into because
I've never had a lorac mega Pro palette
the big mega pros obviously there's four
of them I have never owned one and when
the four was coming out it looked really
intriguing to me I was interested in it
but I believe those palettes are like
$59 so they're really expensive and I
couldn't decide and I didn't know if I
wanted to do it like should this be my
first mega Pro palette and I'm glad that
I did not buy it because a lot of people
were saying that was like the worst of
the mega pro pellets from lorac it did
not get a lot of good reviews it almost
immediately went on sale at Ulta then it
went on sale again like I feel like I
saw this palette for like 27 dollars or
something like that
which is a pretty huge discount from the
original price of $59 but it just did
not seem to be getting very good reviews
at all so I'm glad that I did not decide
to purchase that palette because I
probably would have felt disappointed in
it maybe it would have scared me off
from the other lorac mega Pro palette
switch I feel like most of those do get
pretty good reviews and they used to be
like a really staple product especially
in the beauty community and when I first
started watching YouTube videos I heard
a lot about the lorac mega Pro palette I
heard a lot about like the Urban Decay
Naked palette a lot of buzz about those
but the four did not seem to be doing so
well I just have two more items left the
next one here is the huda beauty of faux
filter foundation this was one that I
just wanted to try I love trying new
foundations I love finding new
foundations I've been on a foundation
kick for quite some time now
so when hooda Beauty was releasing her
foundation I was super interested in it
I wanted to get it and then like every
single shade sold out super quickly it
was crazy and I remember like I would
keep checking and I would place another
order Sephora check to say nope it's
still not in stock I'm like oh my gosh
is this foundation just like absolutely
magical or what and then I started
watching more and more reviews from it
and it's not that I think that it's a
bad product or that people don't like it
but from what people were saying in
there
using like you know what I don't think
that that foundation would have worked
for me it sounds like it's a very full
coverage and it sounds like it's a very
mattifying foundation and two things
that I don't necessarily love for me
personally I like more medium coverage
foundation I like something that kind of
gives me a little bit of like luminosity
or a little bit of doing this to the
skin like a super mattifying foundation
is just not my favorite so when I
started watching the reviews even though
it does seem like a lot of people still
quite enjoy the foundation maybe not as
many as I thought especially with so
many shades being sold out for so long I
guess I just I just expect to see that
foundation like in every single tutorial
video and I don't feel like I see it as
much as them maybe I would think but I
think for what I look for personally in
a foundation that it wouldn't have been
a good match for me and I believe it was
in the $40 range so it's probably best
that I didn't purchase that one and I'm
okay skipping over it now I know it just
came back it just got restocked but I'm
like you know what I'm okay I'm gonna
pass over I'm gonna pass over it and
then the last one I have on my list here
is the wet and wild highlight palette
this was a four pan palette that came
out I want to say it was like $14 or $15
or something like that it has some
really cool unique looking shades in
there but for whatever reason when I
looked at it I was like you know what no
it would kind of was something that I
knew right away that I I wasn't
interested in purchasing I have heard
the single wet and wild highlights I
have the highlight precious puddles and
I know a ton of people really enjoy
those highlights but it just was one
that you just don't give me as hyped is
that it does some other people so I was
like should I purchase an highlight
palette probably not probably wouldn't
be the best move and again this one I
didn't see a ton of great reviews on and
even for people who really really loved
the single wet and wild highlights a lot
of people are saying they didn't feel
like the formula was the same there just
wasn't a lot of great feedback on that
one I also heard a lot of comments about
the packaging and some people thought
the price was too high for wet and wild
as a brand they thought maybe it should
have been more inexpensive especially
with the packaging and all that but it
sounded like a lot of people weren't
quite super happy with the highlights
inside and I've been watching some
de-clutter lately cuz I've been trying
to get myself in the declutter mood I
just did my high-end
palette declutter the other day I have
another declutter coming up so I watch
more and more declutter to kind of like
get me in that vibe you know and I've
been seeing that highlight palette
declutter it out of collections as well
so that kind of says something to me too
so I thought that I was that was a good
decision to pass over that one and
that's another one that I I do not
regret not having that one in my
collection but after the one box
highlight palette boom it's gonna do it
for today's video that was a quick one
okay so that's gonna be everything for
today's video talking about makeup
projects that I do not regret not
purchasing I hope that you guys enjoyed
seeing another regret video from me
again my playlist will be linked down
below if you want to see more videos as
similar in style to this one let me know
in the comments down below what is
something that you decided to pass over
and you're like you know what that was a
good decision I'm not mad that I did not
buy that one I'd love to know what your
products it down below but as always if
you guys did enjoy this one or you find
it helpful or entertaining I hope that
