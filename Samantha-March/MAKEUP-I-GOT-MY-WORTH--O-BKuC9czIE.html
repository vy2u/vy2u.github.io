today's video is going to be all about
makeup products that I feel like I have
gotten my money's worth out of this was
inspired by a video that I did a while
ago when I said to his exact words I
said you know what and I feel like I've
got my money's worth out of this product
and I thought what else in my collection
could I confidently say I've got my
money's worth out of that if it were to
get lost someone were to borrow it and
not return it would I be like it's okay
I've got my - or thought of that so if
you're interested in seeing uh some of
these items in my collection let me go
ahead and get started
so I'm mostly focusing on pallets and
then also foundations here most of the
items in here are more high-end or a
higher price tag because I feel like
it's a little bit maybe harder to get
your money's worth when you've spent
more money on it if that makes sense you
know what I'm saying but actually the
first one that I'm going to talk about
is not high-end but it is what inspired
this video this has been on my list for
a very very long time I don't know why
it's taking me so long to get to it I
truly can't even remember the video that
I was talking about this in but it is
the morphe 35o palette the original 3/5
oh and I believe I was talking about
this palette and how there's the new 3/5
OH - it might even have been Mike my
palette declutter video maybe but I was
saying that you know they now have two
three five oh two out
it's reformulated it's better shadows
you know I really love that one but it's
okay I still feel like I got my money's
worth out of the three 5l this palette I
believe was like twenty two dollars
twenty two fifty when I purchased it I'm
sure I used an influencer code because I
always want to save up money so it was
probably around with the twenty dollar
mark when I purchased it and for sure
for sure I got my money's worth out of
it I did decide to keep it in my palette
declutter as kind of like a comparison
type but honestly I don't know maybe if
I do another declutter coming up this
one might be on the chopping block but I
also have very fond memories of the
original 3/5 Oh everybody was loving
this palette it was so hard to get it
was always out of stock but I finally
got it and I used this palette like
crazy I for sure
got 20 dollars forth out of this palette
if I were to break down all the
different times I used it all the
different
the different videos that I put it in I
first sure got my 20 dollars worth out
of this eyeshadow palette but it was
just funny cuz when I was talking about
the comparison and I said I've got my
money's worth out of it that's what kind
of made me want to look through my
collection tipsy
what else do I feel like I really got my
money's worth out of and you have this
palette for sure I still would recommend
the 3 502 over this one I feel like
morphe has up to there formula
I like the shades in there just a little
bit more as well not just a little bit a
lot bit more as well but I do have some
fond fond memories of the original 3/5
Oh another palette that I definitely
feel like I have gotten my money's worth
out of this one is I think everything
else now is gonna be more high-end but
this is from anastacio Beverly Hills
it's the modern renaissance palette for
sure I've got my money's worth out of
this this is a $49 palette not $42
palette and I picked it up during one of
the VIP fails I believe it was and I
remember being so surprised because I
wasn't gonna purchase this at first I
really didn't have interest in it was
back when I was like I don't know Dan
eyeshadow palette junkie I don't need
every eyeshadow palette Under the Sun
take a look at my latest declutter you
will see that has changed but I wasn't
gonna get it and then everybody started
raving about it and talking about it and
loving this palette and then it kept
being sold out and I was like wow and it
finally came back around the VIPs
all-time and I thought no way I don't
think I was a Rouge yet I think I was
just a regular old vib and I thought for
sure by the time it gets to be my silks
you know Rouge shops first then VIP I
remember thinking there's no way it's
still gonna be in stock and it was so I
actually got a discount off it I don't
remember if it was the 15 or 20% but
let's just say this palette was maybe
around $40 for sure I got $40 worth out
of the modern renaissance this was one
of my and still is one of my favorite
eyeshadow palettes I still continually
reach into this all the time I love
these tones I love the eyeshadows in
here I mean this is a big reason why I
decided to purchase subculture which has
been declared I did still like that
palette but I declutter dad I don't
think I got my $42 worth out of that
palette but I love the formula in these
I again when I was a bridesmaid I was
taking this
I was travelling to weddings I've taken
this out of town for like holidays and
such this is just a great palette one of
those staple palettes in my collection
that like I don't really see myself
getting rid of anytime soon but for sure
for sure
I got my $40 worth out of the modern
renaissance and a foundation that I
thought of Oh excuse my reach but a
foundation that I thought of is this one
from Clinique this is the beyond
perfecting a foundation and concealer I
purchased this one because a lot of
people started talking about it on
YouTube and this was probably like two
years ago maybe but all of a sudden I
just kept seeing a lot of people that I
really really liked here on YouTube
talking about it putting it in their
tutorials and such and I thought you
know what I'm gonna go ahead and do it
Clinique is considered more of a
high-end brand but I believe this
foundation was only twenty seven dollars
I think it still is around twenty seven
dollars which when you think about it I
mean you know now of course drugstore
prices are creeping up and you know
there's you know seventeen fourteen
seventeen dollar drugstore foundations
so when you think about this one being
twenty seven it's like okay it's really
not that bad and other high-end
foundations are more like forty fifty
dollars so it wasn't the most expensive
foundation but this might have been my
first high-end foundation that I was
purchasing so I can remember kind of
feeling like is this a bad idea I don't
know if I should be doing this but
totally for sure I've gotten my money's
worth out of this foundation I have used
this so many times that I'm honestly
surprised I have not run out of it it
really does surprise me I am in the
shade 6.5 buttermilk
I have recommended the foundation so
many times over sorry you can see my
sports bra but a bust occurs for a walk
after this video but I have recommended
this foundation so many times I know
when my good girlfriends bought this and
to wear it on her wedding day because I
said I love the coverage it gives I love
how it makes the skin look natural but
still like better at the same time and
it's so long-lasting again this is what
I wore as a bridesmaid so much because
I'm doing my makeup early in the morning
and I'm gonna be partying on the dance
floor
until late at night I need my foundation
to stay up and it was definitely the
Clinique beyond perfecting another
foundation that I was thin
king of and this one game gave me a
little bit of a pause because I was like
have you really used it that much really
think about it cuz it's kind of newer
ish in my collection and it was pricey
but this is from Dior this is there
forever Foundation are there forever
skin found it yeah Dior skin forever
foundation I always get the name wrong
now this was a $52 foundation I did get
it in one of the VIP sales again I can't
remember if it was the 15 or 20% off
we'll just say it was around like $50
let's just go for that with for maths
sake and so when I was thinking about it
I was like so because it's newer it
would have been in last I think it was
last year's winter sale maybe I could be
wrong but I've had it for a year but I
have used this over and over and over
and over that honestly like you know if
my girlfriend was like and I brought
back to you our foundation and she
didn't bring it back I'd be like you
know what I feel I feel okay about that
I mean I would still be mad night so be
like hey girl you gonna give me my
foundation back or like are we not
friends anymore but I'd be like you know
what I got my money's worth out of that
is cool there was a point in time and I
think I mentioned this in a video where
I think I was talking about how much I
love this foundation that I said I've
been wearing this so much I'm annoyed at
myself because especially when I post my
Instagram tutorials or my photos on
Instagram when I tagged all the makeup
I'm wearing it was do our foundation do
our foundation do your foundation I was
like wear something else but I don't
even know how many times I have worn
this and because I've been like playing
with it here but when I first started
out because it's been sitting up in my
foundation collection you could actually
see the line of how much foundation I've
used and I feel like that's saying a lot
because it has been a very long time
since I've gone through a foundation I
have a lot of foundations I'm switching
them up I'm trying new foundations a lot
but for me to be able to see that I've
already even though it's small but I've
already put a dent in this foundation
that really says a lot I would mine in
the shade zero three zero but this is
such a nice foundation it makes the skin
it's like one of those like natural
finish foundations but it also just
makes your skin look better the coverage
is cell bomb on this but also it's so
long-lasting it really really is so I
just have a few pellets to finish off
with this one is an older palette but
for sure for sure got my
birth out of it but it was one where I
was really hesitant on buying it because
of the high price tag this is from Becca
cosmetics and this is the collaboration
with Jaclyn hill the champagne glow face
palette so inside you have a nice mirror
here you have two big highlight shades
and then also three blushes I believe
this was $54 it was limited-edition it's
not available anymore but I remember I
have in my head that it was $54 and when
it got announced I was like I can't
afford $54 for that palette but I and I
struggled so I was like I want it so bad
not only did I want it for myself but I
was like this would be such a cool thing
to be able to put into my videos you
know zhilie kind of like that youtuber
mentality but other than that like at
that time I was a huge Jaclyn hill
supporter I watched all of her videos I
felt like we were best friends you know
you know all that fun stuff
and I really really wanted this palette
and I did end up buying it and I have to
say that I really don't regret it and I
for sure feel like I got my $54 worth
out of this palette I don't think I got
any discounts on it and I'm pretty sure
I bought it she was doing like a release
party or something in New York and they
let it release early if you had a
certain code or something like that I
don't remember you guys remember that
and I did so I didn't get no just come
on it but it still is something that I
will say that I got my money's worth out
of it I still reach into this palette
even though it's limited edition some of
the shades in here are not like the
highlights are shampoo pop and Prosecco
pop then the the blush shades are rose i
spritz amaretto and Pamplemousse I'm not
as familiar with becca blushes so i'm
not for sure about those but the the
highlights I mean you can still get
those as well or in the split pans and
yeah I mean it was pricey I was hesitant
about it but I don't regret it and I
first sure again you know if my
girlfriend's gonna borrow this and not
bring it back we're really not gonna be
friends but I would feel confident in
saying you know I got my money's worth
out of this palette palette like lots of
memories okay the next one I want to
talk about is also another influencer
collaboration and this one this one this
is the Smashbox highlight palette this
is in collaboration with Casey Holmes
they're called the spotlight palettes
and the one that I
is in Perl and it's funny because
thinking about this palette inside you
have three highlight shades and a nice
mirror it's $35 thinking about this
palette and why I wanted to include it
in this video was because around this
time KC was coming out for collaboration
with Smashbox and Nicole Guerrero was
coming out with her glow kit with
anastacio Beverly Hills and I really
wanted both of the palettes but I was
like you can only afford one and I love
KC
and I love Nicole I love highlights I
really enjoy Anasazi I really enjoy
Smashbox I was like what do I do and how
do I pick I ended up going with the
Nicole Guerrero at $40 because I was
like well there's for highlight shades
in there so for only the five dollars
more maybe it's better to go with that
and I believe I was making a purchase
from Sephora and it was there and I
could get a discount I can't quite
remember because I know for sure and
these are at Sephora and Ulta but I do
also remember that this was sold out for
a while so maybe when I actually made
the purchase it was sold out I don't
remember for sure but I remember
deciding to go with the Nicole Guerrero
and I didn't like it
I did come shattered of course I don't
know why I thought to choose a glow kit
over it because I think all of my glow
kids have come shattered and I also just
didn't enjoy the shades they were too
glittery on me I ended up decluttering
it and I was so bummed but came back
around I decided to order the Smashbox
and Casey Holmes palette and oh man I
love this palette this is such a good
highlight palette you can still get this
available it's no longer considered a
collab with Casey home so like the box
doesn't have her photo on it anymore but
you can still buy these palettes and
they are still really freaking good
all three highlights in there I can wear
them separately I can mix them together
I can mix two shades you have a mirror
it's travel friendly this is such a good
palette and I just thought that was kind
of a funny that you guys know I like to
tell stories I thought it was kind of a
funny story that I would put in here but
especially when thinking about did I get
my $40 worth of that glow kit no did I
get my $35 worth out of this palette
heck yes I have used it over and over
and over again I still continue to reach
for it for sure got my money's worth out
of it so so that was kind of fun
and then just one of our item to go here
but this one is from a dose of colors
this is the marvelous and moths
eyeshadow palette
these are $32 pellets so they are fairly
pricey you do get five shades inside you
also do get a little double ended brush
honestly the brushes are really good in
the dose of colors palettes most brushes
and palettes I don't like the dose of
colors I really like their brushes in
there but you also do get a mirror it's
nice packaging as well it's trouble from
me with just great but $32 for five
shades is pretty higher up there but man
I have gotten I can't even tell you you
guys how often I use this palette I mean
you see it on me a lot you see it come
traveling with me a lot I took this on
my Arizona vacation with me back in
March and used only this palette during
that trip I love the shades in here I
love the mob tones but the I just I
enjoy this formula so much I've gone on
to buy two other dose of colors palettes
as well and then I think I also got one
gift it to me is that how it works
I have a lot of their palettes now I
want all of them because I love the
quality in here so much but for sure I
can't remember it's been so long since I
bought this palette I can't remember if
I bought it with a discount or not so
even if we're saying I bought this for
full price at the $32
nobody Gress about that I first sure got
my money's worth and continued to get my
money's worth out of this palette
honestly if I had to guess like through
all the palettes that I own I do not hit
pan I'm really anything because I'm so
light handed with my makeup but I could
see this being the eyeshadow palette
that I hit pan on especially this second
color right here I can see that
happening you can see a big dent in it
so I don't we shall see but yeah for
sure I got my money's worth out of the
marvelous knobs it's gonna be everything
a for today's a video chatting over some
of my makeup products in my collection
that I feel like I got my money's worth
out of I'd love to know some of yours in
the comments down below if you guys did
