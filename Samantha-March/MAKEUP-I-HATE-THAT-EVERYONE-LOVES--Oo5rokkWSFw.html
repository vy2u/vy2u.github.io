today's video is going to be about some
makeup products that I hate then it
seems like everybody else loves and I
saw my friends live and a Kaylee do
these videos they did a collab video
actually a few weeks back so I will have
both of their videos linked down below I
hope that you'll go check them out
but I enjoyed watching them so much and
I even mentioned them in a video asking
you guys if you would want to see the
same video from me and a lot of people
said yes to that one so that is what we
were going to be doing today I'm gonna
be chatting about makeup that just did
not work out for me that it seems like
everybody else really enjoys so why
don't we go ahead and get started
alright to start off I will say that I
don't hate a lot of makeup like I said
it's just gonna be makeup products that
didn't necessarily work out for me I
returned them decluttered them I just
didn't like them for some reason and it
seems like I always see these products
recommended they're always in favorites
videos people are always using them and
a lot of these products I bought because
of they got such glowing recommendations
and reviews and they just ended up not
working out for me I thought it was
super interesting when Liv and Kaylee
did this video because I'm so always
someone who tries to remind people that
at the end of the day it's just makeup
and not every single makeup item is
going to work for everybody out there it
is simply not possible and I think these
videos are so much fun I did kind of a
similar collab video with Liv over the
summer called yin and yang reviews where
we actually took each other and I
mentioned products that she loved that I
didn't love and she did the same but
then we also flipped it in the same
video as well and we did the vice versus
an eye to it and I thought that was so
much fun and I think these videos are
important to show that everybody has
different reactions to make up a you
know super makeup products work for some
skin tones not others for some makeup
vibes and others and we're all so
different and unique and just because
one person doesn't like something that
you consider a favorite or it doesn't
mean that they're a terrible person you
know what I'm saying the first item that
I want to chat about is one that I
actually got reminded of when I chatted
about makeup products that I wish I
would have bought sooner I'll have that
video linked down below as well and I
was talking about the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer and I said that there was
two concealers at one point that I felt
like we're getting super super hyped and
I wanted them both on my list
one was the urban decay and
was the NARS radiant creamy concealer I
ended up purchasing the NARS I didn't
love it and held off on purchasing the
Urban Decay for that reason and then I
wish I would have bought the Urban Decay
over the NARS the NARS radiant creamy
concealer have it any more a lot of
these either decluttered I've returned
I've given away to friends things like
that so I will have photos listed here
on the screen so you can see them but
nothing about the NARS radiant creamy
concealer worked out for me like nothing
about it and I'm pretty sure I got this
in a social all box which used to be a
makeup subscription box where you could
try out samples of high-end makeup it's
no longer around anymore but when I got
that box I was like okay I always hear
everybody talking about this one I'm so
excited for it let's give it a try and I
remember trying it and being like okay
what's wrong with me because I was very
confused but I didn't like it because
especially at the time where I really
started getting into YouTube videos and
watching them and buying the things that
people are recommending and it seemed
like everybody was using the NARS
radiant creamy concealer I didn't find
it creamy I didn't find it radiant I'm
not a fan of dryer concealers like dryer
formulas for concealers and I thought it
was super dry I remember thinking it was
hard to blend out and I remember
thinking it just looked really thick on
my under eyes I didn't I didn't like it
at all at all and I was super bummed
about it so definitely the NARS radiant
creamy concealer I'd love to know if you
guys have tried it did you buy a based
on a bunch of the reviews and
recommendations and favorites videos and
all of that like I did and then it
didn't work out for you or are you
someone who loves it let us know item
that I was like crushed that didn't work
out for me was the Anastasia Beverly
Hills in Nicole Guerrero glow kit I was
so hyped when I saw this collaboration I
really enjoyed Nicole Guerrero she's
definitely one of like the og youtubers
then I started watching
I like the Anasazi at glow kits I have
like two other ones from her and I quite
liked them and when I saw that she was
doing the cloud with Nicole I was like
yes I can't wait my Glock it did come
shattered which is not a shock anymore
because the majority of my Glock hits
have come shattered either from the
Anasazi website or Sephora I don't know
what it is so that was a really big
bummer to me but it was only one shade
that broke it was the bottom pan and the
last one which honestly wouldn't have
been great
my skintone anyway so I was like no big
deal brush it off just use the other
ones and it'll be fine but for me I felt
like they were so glittery they did not
look good on me and it almost like I
feel like really glittery highlights can
kind of age me and I'm 30
nobody needs help aging this girl okay
like I can't have that happen and I was
so bummed and I was seeing all these
wonderful reviews and after I got it I
started playing with it I was like I
don't feel like this is going well and
then like no girl you've got this you
were gonna make this work for you
everybody else loves it you will love it
and finally I just had to throw the
towel and I was like you guys I don't I
don't actually love it on my skin I did
end up decluttering it I think someone
actually bought it in my blog Phil and I
hope that she is enjoying it she loves
it but unfortunately it did not work out
for me and I'm so bummed about that this
next one I feel like I really do make
people mad when I say that this
eyeshadow palette did not work for me
it's the Urban Decay Naked heat I
actually recently did a seven
dissapointing makeup products in 2017
I'll have that video linked down below
as well and I mentioned the Urban Decay
Naked Heat and I mean I got told that
people can't watch my reviews anymore
because I don't like can I get heat
which and again just a reminder that
just because a person that doesn't love
one thing that you happen to love
doesn't make them a bad person it just
doesn't but yeah I got told that people
can't watch my reviews anymore because
of that people like some people set
their unsubscribing because I don't like
that they can heat and I'm like y'all
got to do it you got to do but that's
like the weirdest thing to me in the
world I watch a lot of different YouTube
channels a lot of different youtubers I
consider a lot of people my friends and
we have different tastes and make up
different items work for us and I don't
think at less of anybody out there okay
so like whoa but yeah a lot of people
were very upset a lot of people are
saying that was their favorite eyeshadow
palette and I'm like I'm sorry but I
returned it I didn't love the formula
first of all I didn't think it was that
great for being I think it's a $54
eyeshadow palette I need to be blown
away for $54 and I just wasn't blown
away we also have the urban decay naked
smoky palette I got that gifted to me at
Christmas and I think it's a fine eye
shadow palette but I don't like oh
really love it I don't reach for it all
the time I think it's just like pretty
and that's what I thought of the naked
heat and for pretty good at $54 that's
not good enough for me I need it to be
better than that and then the other
thing that I didn't love about then they
get heat was that I felt like it was too
monochromatic and I knew that going into
it you know I could see the pictures and
you know I saw the evidence in front of
me but I was still like no girl you've
got this because I love warm tones you
know that's my vibe that's my style I
have tart toasted palate on today which
is kind of similar to the naked heat my
review is coming soon but I was like no
you will love this palette like these
are your vibes these your tones these
are your shades this is meant for you
and then when I actually got it and I
spent so much time trying to play with
it and come up with different looks and
I was like every look I'm doing looks
the freaking same I can't make my looks
different I don't know what's going on
and when the Urban Decay Naked heat
released a lot of people were doing like
tutorials and stuff and I could tell
like I didn't even need to see that they
were doing a naked heat tutorial look at
those thumbnail their photo their
Instagram picture whatever it was and be
like make it heat because not only was i
doing the same look I felt like we were
all doing the same look so again $54 for
that it just soon and seemed worth it to
keep around in my collection I have so
many different eyeshadow palettes I
definitely have those very similar
shades it released around the same time
of the jaclyn hill morphe palette and I
love that palette and I felt like I was
finding a lot of similar shades in there
which was a big bummer apologize if you
hear areas snoring she's deep sleep
right now right next to me I'm just
snorted quite lovely but you know that
one did not work for me and I feel like
I make a lot of people mad whenever I
bring it up but I'm sorry I know a lot
of people love it but it just wasn't for
me so next time I have a foundation no
one's gonna be surprised if you are not
new to my channel this foundation is
from Estee Lauder it's the double wear
nude water fresh makeup I bought this
because everybody loves the original
Estee Lauder Double Wear so many people
would recommend it and I didn't purchase
it because everyone said helpful
coverage it was I'm not a huge full
coverage person I was like I don't think
I've made something like that so when
they came out with the water fresh
makeup a lot of people like blew up
about it and they were so excited about
it because you know it was just supposed
to be not as full coverage as the Estee
Lauder so people are recommending
everywhere like Oh
say a lot our original didn't work out
for you get the water one I'm like yeah
I'm gonna get the water one girl love oh
and then I got it and I was like okay
not so good so it didn't come with a
pump which was a huge bummer to me cuz I
think this was was at $46 $42 for this
foundation it didn't come with a pump so
I had the issue because it's super super
liquidy because it's a water foundation
I had the issue of when I poured it it
was going everywhere on me on my chair
on my carpet in my office like it was
kind of a disaster but I did have a
subscriber send me a pump which was
super super nice but this is a twelve
dollar mac pump
putting this foundation in the high 50
range which i think is very pricey for a
foundation and it just didn't look great
on me it was very streaky on me I just
couldn't get it to like sit or blend
well on the skin and I tried so hard
because you know I saw everybody
recommending this once it came out and
saying you know the the original didn't
work for you go for this one and then
when I was playing with it in videos or
reviewing it or talking about it people
are like no you have to make this work
for you like this is a great foundation
and I love it and I'm like okay I'm
gonna try to love it and I should have
returned it to Ulta because it was so
expensive like I should have just
returned it right away
when it wasn't working out for me but I
kept it because everybody else wanted me
to love it too and I'm like I want to
love it but I can't you know it's like a
rom-com gone bad I don't know what to do
about it but this foundation just did
that work for me I think I have enough
for sale like my Poshmark
or something like that it just didn't
work out for me I thought it was really
expensive didn't look great on me we
just didn't get along such a bummer
so another foundation that did not work
for me but was much more affordable than
the Estee Lauder was the went wild photo
focused foundation I don't have that one
any longer but I will go ahead and
insert the photo of it here as well this
was a newer foundation from went wild a
couple months back and people were
getting pretty hyped for it pretty
stoked for it
I went to my drugstore and found it and
I was very excited to give it a try
especially because one mile is so
affordable and we especially now we're
seeing drugstore prices go up and up and
up but I feel like wet and wild has been
really good at keeping their prices like
standard for wet and wild which i think
is fantastic
so when I saw this like five dollar
foundation six dollar foundation I was
like yeah okay I'll give that a try and
I was bummed because I just didn't think
it did anything for my skin and
sometimes I run into a foundation like
this where it just sits there like it
looks like I'm wearing foundation which
is a bummer because you know we want to
look like we woke up like this but it
just kind of sat there on my skin but it
didn't do anything it didn't make me
look healthy or luminous or glowy or
even like matte like it just it didn't
do anything it just sat there and I was
like well what what am I supposed to do
with this and I tried it so many
different times and I ended up putting
it I think it was on my Poshmark and
someone bought it so I hope that they
enjoyed it as well but for me it just
didn't really work out I loved the fact
that it was affordable I really enjoyed
that but that's kind of like where it
ended because nothing else after that it
really it worked out for me and I know I
still see a lot of people using it like
I've seen people repurchase it in their
videos and you know what that's freaking
awesome I'm glad that it worked out for
you but for me no no go another item a
friend what in the wild that I tried I
tried my hardest I tried my hardest to
love these where they're liquid catsuit
liquid lipsticks I've talked about this
in previous videos as well I think I
might have mentioned them in my least
favorite makeup products of 2017 I
wanted to love these liquid lipsticks so
freaking hard I bought like five of them
I think it was I bought an array of
different colors because I convinced
myself that like it was like the dark
color that didn't work for me and then I
bought like the beige and I was like too
light to light go more towards the
middle and then those will work for you
like why was that my thought process I
have no idea
I even tried multiple stores I tried
multiple cities because again I was like
maybe it's just the Des Moines area
it's the Des Moines area for sure like
we got a bad batch over here so I even
purchased a liquid lipstick an hour and
a half away from here just to be on the
safe side don't worry I didn't travel
specifically for the liquid lipstick we
were going back to visit my in-laws I
still made a special stop just survived
this liquid lipstick because so many
people rave about them people have made
whole videos of
how much they love these lipsticks and
swatching all of them have played them
all on their lips and I'm like where did
I go wrong what is wrong with my lips
that is not wrong with everybody else's
lips that's just not fair again they
were super affordable I think there were
like five dollars but still when when
you end up buying five it's like while I
could have just bought a nice lipstick
and been over it but I gave it I gave it
my all like you guys could not tell me
that I didn't try to make those things
work because I tried so hard I ended up
- cluttering although I gave some of
them away to friends I really enjoyed
the lipstick so I was like here you'll
have some more colors but I you know it
just didn't work out for me so bummed
that one still hurts so finally I have a
couple different brow products so that I
want to end this one the first one is
the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz now
this is not a product that I hate like I
said the beguine I don't really hate a
lot of products they just don't work out
from you a certain reason this brow is I
think is okay but the reason I wanted to
put it in here was because this is so
freakin high I mean from the moment that
I got on YouTube instead of watching
YouTube videos everybody was telling me
to buy it the brow Wiz I didn't do it
until this year because it's like twenty
one or twenty three dollars or something
I don't know but it's expensive and so I
kept waiting and I kept waiting I think
I bought it during some sort of sale
time I don't remember which one but I
know I did not pay full price for this
guy because that's too expensive for me
everybody is always recommending this
one and saying it's their favorite brow
product and all of this and I'm like
okay I want to love you and I want to
use this every day and I want to tell
people how amazing the brow is is - but
I would just be lying like I said I
think it's fine but it's like something
that I can make work for me some days
and other days my brows are terrible
when I use this and I'm like how do I
get such different reactions like
there's really no in-between when I use
this to see they're like girl your brows
on fleek or it's like girl your brows
look horrible get off camera like
there's no one between for me I don't
know what I'm doing differently because
I don't have anything I don't have that
experience with any other brow products
I mentioned the precisely my brow from
benefit and my products that I wish I
would have bought sooner because I felt
like I can get it every single
time with the precisely my brow I I
don't have the like some days that looks
good some days it looks bad like the
precisely my brow is on and it gets it
and this to me is really similar to the
precisely my brow like it's a very small
and defined and I feel like it should do
the job well but like it just it just
doesn't it's just not all the way there
for me I also feel like some other
reasons why I don't love it is because I
feel like I have to press really really
hard like to the point where I press so
hard I actually remove some of my
eyebrows and when I get done using this
I literally have like eyebrows on my
eyelids because I've had to press so
hard with this guy I don't know what
that is about but I feel like I use a
ton of product and I feel like it takes
me a really long time to use I have not
had this one very long and I'm almost
out of it I rolled it up the other day
and I was like and that's expensive for
a brow pencil because I just feel like
you have to use so much product to get
anything out and you have to press so
hard which I do not enjoy so it's fine
but I think it's too expensive for me to
want to repurchase and I'm just super
bummed because again like this is
everybody's like Holy Grail brow product
and I like is it just because I'm not
good at doing brows because I was a
little a blue my hair I'm not really
sure what happened other people have
recommended to me the brow definer from
Anastacio because I've mentioned this
before I think I reviewed this in like a
hall update video and kind of I mean
just said exactly what I just said now a
lot of people said I should try the bra
definer so maybe I'll give that a shot
see what I think about it let me know if
you've tried it but I don't know the
brow was just didn't really do much for
me and then the other product that I
want to mention is actually what people
say is a dupe for the brow Wiz and that
is the NYX micro brow pencil that is one
of the first brow products that I tried
I tried a couple other ones from like I
know I tried Maybelline for sure and I
think I tried a Loreal brow pencil if
something else from the drugstore line
because when I was first starting to try
to learn brows I didn't want to purchase
really expensive items to practice on
and learn on and I ended up purchasing
from benefit and then
things finally started clicking for me
so that's why I love the benefit broad
products so much you know I'm always
recommending them but I would hear
people recommending this but then they
would say oh but if you want to cheaper
more affordable option give them NYX
micro brow so my mind was like okay I'm
gonna get the NYX micro brow and I can
still practice with that one I mean it
is a dupe for the brow Wiz I believe but
I don't like it for the same reasons
that I don't like this you have to press
super hard not a lot of product shows up
but you have to use a ton of product
just to get it show up so like the
reasons that I don't like this is the
reasons why I don't like the NYX and I
just wanted to kind of put those two
together because I would always hear
people recommending this and then the
same breath oh if you want to do use the
NYX one use the NYX own and that's why I
bought the NYX because so many people
told me it was a dupe for this and then
when that didn't work out I was like I'm
gonna try the non dupe the og I don't
know I'm gonna try that Anasazi and give
it a shot and then it still didn't work
for me for the same reason as the NYX I
was like well that backfired in a big
way so unfortunately neither the
Anastacio nor the dupe the NYX micro
brow pencil neither of those guys worked
out for me huge bummer
okay so that is everything for this
video on products that I hate that
everybody else seems to love I would
love to know what you thought of all the
products that I mentioned in the
comments down below what are some of
your products that you just do not like
it all that did not work for you but you
think everybody else is always
recommending make sure to check out live
and Kaylie's videos again they'll both
be in the description box down below
make sure to watch their videos as well
I also did the flipside to this they
also did the products that they love
that it seems like nobody else likes if
you guys would like to see me do that
type of video as well please do let me
know in the comments because I sure
couldn't do that but as always if you
guys did enjoyed this video I hope that
you will give it a thumbs up I hope that
