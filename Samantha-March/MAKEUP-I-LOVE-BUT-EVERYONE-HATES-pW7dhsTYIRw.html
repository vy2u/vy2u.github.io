today's video is going to be all about
that makeup products that I love and it
seems like nobody else does I did the
flip side of this video about two weeks
ago or so makeup products I hate that
everybody else loves I will have that
video it licit down below and both of
these videos were inspired from my
friend Kaylee I will have her channel
listed down below as well she kind of
started this one and it's where I saw it
from and I thought it was such a fun
ideas I'll have her channel list it down
below as well and I hope that you will
go check her out and her videos as well
but if you'd like to see is some makeup
that I quite enjoy but it seems like no
one else does when we go ahead and get
started
all right the first item that I want to
talk about when I saw Kaylee to this
video this was probably the first item
that popped into my head this is the
milk makeup blur stick I really really
enjoy the milk makeup blur stick and it
seems like not a lot of people do and it
seems like the blur stick and people who
do like the blur stick like it really
talked down about I know that milk
makeup sent out a bunch of these and PR
when they were first releasing I did not
get it in that wave but you know I saw
the videos too and everybody was talking
about it and it seemed to be like a very
hyped up product and I even a pretty
sure I talked about this in a will I buy
a video way long ago and I was like I do
want to get it because it seems Kloss
like it just seems like a lot of money
for a primer and I wasn't really into
using face primers at the time that this
was coming out I still kind of thought
like do they have a point I'm not really
a hundred percent on that I know use a
primer every single day because I have
been able to see the difference of
primer can make so I was like I don't
know I think I should skip over it then
I actually ended up getting it sent to
me in PR and this was after the craze
already happened and it's kind of like
the hype had died down and I tried it
out myself and I was like oh my gosh
this is fantastic I don't deal with a
ton a ton of pores but right here
especially and especially on this side
of my face I have an extremely large
pore on this side of my face I always
have legitimately always have and it's
really really frustrating to me so I
love to use this right here and the last
times I will you
on my chin and then right like in the
center of my forehead I can get some
floors and that's where I'll put it and
it's so easy to swipe on and I'll just
kind of take my fingers and blot it out
and boom like my pores are covered
they're filled in they're smoothed out
and I'm like this is freaking awesome so
I said it in a video and I was so
excited about it I was like I'm so happy
I gotta test this out and see if it's
worth the hype and it is and I love it
in blah blah and everybody not everybody
you know I'm dramatic here but so many
people were like it's tough because
you've got it in PR you're not being
truthful and I was like yeah yeah duh no
no I don't like it
I don't like it because it's the
comments like that can sometimes truly
get into my head and I'm like no I let
the hype gets me I don't really like
this product it's yeah duh it's totally
because I got I'm here I'm not using
this product anymore
and I put it away and I was like no I'm
not gonna use that again because
everybody got mad at me when I said I
liked it and you know I'm probably just
like lying to myself so I'm not gonna
use it again and then I kept using it
but I just feel like not use it on
camera so people kind of see me use it
cuz then they'd be like oh no girl
you're only using that could you like in
pure I just really enjoyed this product
I tried not to I've tried to convince
myself it was only for PR and then I
would like it was like you know someone
like going to get their fix like no I'm
just gonna take out that blur soak one
more time and this is my last time using
it this is my last time using it and
then I'm just gonna give it up 100% cold
turkey no I can't get this up cold
turkey I really enjoy this product
it's appear to have it some lipsticks to
shout about these are the NYX a lingerie
lipsticks I hear so many bad reviews
about these and I really really enjoy
them these were the two shades that I
originally bought for myself I bought
them in a ruffled trim and then also
bedtime flirt so I went out and
purchased these myself even after seeing
the reviews because when these came out
I felt like there was a lot of review
videos about them as well and truly I
felt like a lot of them were negative
but a lot of people were saying like oh
they're super drying but sometimes I
like a liquid lipstick that is a little
bit more drying like not like super
uncomfortable hurts my lips drying
but a little bit drier because I like it
to dry down all the way and I like to
put my lipstick on before I go out and
then not have to worry about it again
and worry about touching it up so when I
saw these and of course I saw the entire
nude collection I got excited for it and
it was next
no structure and it was affordable and I
was like I'm just gonna give him a try
and I actually really really enjoyed
these I did end up getting a PR package
from NYX it was earlier this year and it
came with all of the different shades of
the NYX lingerie lipsticks so I did try
a few of them and what I will say is
that I think there is like I think some
of the shades perform differently than
others and what I felt like was with the
really lighter shades I feel like they
are very streaky and very hard to get
like an actual good pigmentation to the
lips but if you stay more towards like
the mid range or the darker news that
they have in there I think that those
are really nice so yes they are a little
bit more on the drier side but I still
find them to be a fairly comfortable
liquid lipstick they're very
long-lasting and for the drugstore price
like I do not mind these at all and I
still wear them quite frequently if I
have a concealer to chat about this is
from a Tarte cosmetics this is the
rainforest of the sea aqua concealer I
felt like I heard a lot of negative
things about this concealer and it's
actually one of my favorites and again
if you can tell that I have used quite a
bit of it I mean I have a lot of
concealers so when I see that in this
concealer I mean this is how much I use
concealer and I really do enjoy it I
know a lot of the reviews I was saying
was people didn't feel like it covered a
ton this is definitely not a super full
coverage concealer it's the aqua
concealer it's you know made with water
it's a little bit of a thinner formula
but somedays I like that and especially
in the summer I want for this one quite
a bit and days where I don't always need
a full coverage concealer and sometimes
full coverage concealers aren't my
favorite I want it just tone down a
little bit and this is a really good
option to do I know a lot of people said
that has a very very strong smell and it
does it has a very strong kind of like
paint like smell but after I apply it
and then you know put the applicator
back into the product then I don't smell
it on my face it doesn't stick around
and it doesn't bother me too much it
doesn't irritate my eyes or anything
like that
there's no sensitivity when wearing this
product so I reach for this one a ton I
really enjoy this concealer and I'm not
mad about it next time I have an
eyeshadow palette this is from lorac
cosmetics it is their pro brunch palette
oh my gosh I feel like nobody likes this
eyeshadow palette
came out earlier in the spring I believe
it was and I purchased it myself I
purchased it from Ulta and I believe the
palette was in the $40 range and it was
my first lorac palette that I ever
purchased I had just made a video of the
seven brands I want to try in 2017 lorac
was featured in that video and I was
like you know what I feel like this is
eye catching to me I feel like I don't
have I don't think I had any pesto i
shadow palettes at the time so I was
like you know instead of buying all
these eyeshadow palettes that are pretty
similar to one another I mean you know
we all know what I'm talking about there
I was like this is just different I
don't have anything like this yet in my
collection and I bought it and I'm like
okay I did a review on it and I was like
am i absolutely blown away like I think
this is the best palette ever of life no
but do I like it yes so this isn't
something I necessarily love but I
really do like it a lot I have still
kept it around and I still reach for it
I feel like I can create really pretty
pastel looks with this palette and
sometimes especially during the spring
that is what I was going for like how
like Easter egg type looks with these
light blues and the light Purple's
there's a beautiful green over here like
I really did enjoy this palette and
there would be so many times where I
would be wearing a look and people would
ask me I was wearing a sailor rock
brunch I actually had people tell me
that I could not be wearing a lover at
brunch and like what did I do to make my
eye look different and I'm like nothing
like I don't know I mean again they're
not like the most just super pigmented
powerful impactful shadows but when I
open a pastel palette that's not what I
think I'm going to get so I like to this
just fine I would say like in my review
and when I was talking about it like
maybe trying to get it for a discount
because it is a pretty pricey palette
but I still liked it just fine if it's
the more lip products here to talk about
these are from milk makeup and they are
their lip products or lip colors lip
colors is what these are called I have
seen very very mixed of feedback about
these and again I don't know what it is
with milk makeup and their PR but it's
like so many products that people really
enjoy from milk makeup it's just assumed
that people are saying they like it
because they want to stay on PR list so
they want to get more PR and that's
really frustrating to me because I enjoy
these so freakin much I mentioned them
in my top 17 in 2017 video I've
mentioned in my favorites videos I put
them
Best Debut 2017 video cream which is
kind of like the nude pink shade this is
always in my clutch I take it out with
me all of the time it's one of my
favorites I actually have one on my lips
today this is Loki that I have on my
lips and when milk sent me these in PR
they sent me all of the different colors
and I can't remember exactly for sure
how many there was but it was like 10 to
15 different lip colors I normally would
keep like 2 to 3 when when a brand sends
me a bunch of you know the same product
but in different colors like with lip
products I will only keep you know the
handful of my favorites and then I will
put the rest in giveaways I will give
away to friends and things like that but
when I started trying these and I
realized I liked them so much because
that's what I did I got these in NPR I
grabbed out it was like 3 like a nude I
think it was cream this color and then
one like kind of deeper brown shade and
I was like these are the ones that I'll
keep I'll put the rest away and I
started trying these and I was like wait
a second I really like these and I took
like 1 or 2 out of the giveaway pilot
you know I was like super selfish I was
like I just want to keep a few more of
these
and then I tried them up some more and I
think I ended up keeping at least one
other one for myself that was originally
going to be given away but it's because
I wanted to have a good range of colors
in this formula because I like the
formula so much and I normally do not do
that I normally don't kind of like pad
my collection like that but when I find
out what's the formula that I really
love I want to have a nude I want to
have a pink I want to have a red I want
to have a brown I want to have a deep
color because that way whatever it is
whatever lip color I want to do with
whatever look or outfit I'm wearing or
event and going to I will have that
color in my favorite formula so I don't
know what else to say other than I
actually really do enjoy these and
they're just some of my favorites and I
really do recommend them that's all I
can say hair is looking like a hot mess
after having extensions in all weekend
Boop don't mind that anyways moving on
to keep a real thing I have here next as
some MAC lipsticks and these are the
just regular MAC lipsticks now Mac I
feel like is obviously a very well-known
like international brand and
I feel like they have a lot of really
hyped up products but I don't really
feel like I heard a lot of super
positive things about the MAC lipsticks
I saw a lot of people wearing them but
at the same time and like using them in
tutorials and stuff when I first started
youtube but at the same time I would
also see these mentioned so much by
other youtubers saying how they don't
really like these they don't think
they're worth the hype they think that
they're very drying lipsticks and you
know they're just not their favorite
formula so I didn't buy any MAC
lipsticks because I was seeing that and
I was like I don't know I don't know if
I should do that Mac is also not super
accessible where I live we only have one
Mac store located in a mall I mean
that's not super close to me so I was
like yeah you know maybe I won't do it
you know there seems to be so many
conflicting opinions about these but
then I had a friend send me a birthday
gift last year and inside included a
couple different MAC lipsticks including
a velvet teddy which velvet teddy is now
like one of my favorite lip colors I
think it is such a beautiful food but
when I tried these I was like well I
really liked that wasn't right I don't
really I didn't feel like they were
drying I didn't feel like they weren't
lasting well on me like to me they were
just like a solid creamy regular
lipstick so I'm like I don't know that's
confusing and then I actually got a
bunch of lipsticks sent to me from Mac
in PR which was super cool but then I
got to try even more than I just had the
two shades so then I was getting able to
try even more of the MAC lipsticks and
truly like I have no issue at all with
the MAC lipsticks and I actually really
like them and I reach for them so much I
just mentioned the nude lipsticks in my
best of beauty 2017 video because the
Mac nude lips are some of my favorites I
love reaching for them I just feel like
they're so easy to apply they go on so
well they stay on so well I mean their
regular lipsticks so they don't last as
long as the liquid lipstick by any means
you know they fade throughout the day
and they'll you know wear a way if you
eat like a normal lipstick would but I
mean I don't think that these are bad at
all and I really enjoy these I always
have at least one MAC lipstick and my
clutch
as of right now it's my current favorite
nude which is called age sex location
yes it is
that one is always in my question makes
I love wearing it and I love having it
like what's in my clutch is kind of like
my staple like I have to have this if I
go out type of thing so that's kind of
what if you ever hear me say like it's
in my clutch it means like I really love
it and I have to have it with me because
my clutch is typically what I take when
we go out like on the weekends and at
nights and things like that but yeah I
really like these lipsticks I don't know
I know if a lot of people don't seem to
really like them but I do next time I
have a foundation to talk about and this
was one that at first I thought was
hyped but then I realized that I was
seeing this foundation a lot in like
makeup I regret buying you know makeup
disappointments and things like that
it kind of confused me when I was seeing
them and it really actually kind of
bummed me out but this is the L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow foundation I don't
know why people don't like I really like
this foundation it's almost gone like it
is almost almost empty I really enjoyed
this foundation I know that they also
came out with the infallible Pro matte
foundation and I remember that was like
a craze in it of itself and then I felt
like this one came out and I still felt
like it was getting a lot of hype but
then as I kept watching videos then
that's when I was seeing and regret
videos and disappointment videos and you
know makeup I didn't like and you're all
those things and I'm like shoot I just
don't really like the saw nation and I
really do it like I said I've almost
finished with it it's the pro glow
foundation I like foundations I tend to
lean towards foundations that make me a
little bit glowy or a little bit dewy
and that's just kind of like my personal
preference but I have very normal skin
but this says it's a radiant finish for
normal to dry skin and it's a hydrating
foundation especially in the summer I
thought oh my gosh I just thought this
was so beautiful I loved it it was
affordable and I think it's great so I'm
super bummed when I started seeing that
but I still really enjoyed my foundation
hope you're still here because I felt
it's like saving the best for last this
last product that I really like that
caused an internet sensation in the year
of 2017 is the subculture by Anastasi of
Beverly Hills oh did you want subscribe
for me cuz I like this thank you bitch
did you
Wow this palette this palette really got
a lot of interesting reviews when it
came out but I was one who liked it the
subculture this isn't one that I love
and it's not like my Holy Grail palette
by any means but I still really like it
I still reach for it I like the looks
that I've created with it and I didn't
return it if I don't like makeup I will
return it I don't have a problem doing
that because I spend a lot of money on
makeup and if I don't like something or
if I truly like hater product I will
return it to get my money back but I did
not return this one I do have a review
video on it and like I said I like it I
understand like I understand where the
frustrations was because I was
frustrated with the way it was marketed
that's for sure but the actual product I
do like and I get what people say about
you know how how pigmented they are and
how it can be hard to handle but I'm
someone who goes in with a very light
hand anyways with all of my makeup
that's just how I am so I really don't
have a problem with this palette and no
I'm not a makeup artist and whatnot but
I can still make this one work for me
and I would literally like the colors I
like the shade selection I like that it
was a different palette like kind of
what also drew me to this palette with
you know fossil of being told that it
was the sister to modern Renaissance
which is not the case but one of the big
reasons that I was attracted to the
palette was because of the different
shade selections you know we we always
hear oh we're so tired of warm pellets
and we're so tired of the petals that
look the same I was like this doesn't
look the same like those looks cool and
has cool and interesting colors in it
you know sometimes I have to take a
couple seconds and look at it and be
like what exactly am I doing with this
today but I really like all the looks
that I've been able to create with it
and I haven't had any real issues with
it I wanted to keep it in my collection
because I think it's kind of just like a
fun and funky palette to be able to have
on hand but I really like this palette
and in case you didn't know a lot of
people did not like this palette okay so
that is going to do it before the makeup
I love that it seems like everybody else
hates I hope that you guys enjoyed this
video and of course I would love to hear
