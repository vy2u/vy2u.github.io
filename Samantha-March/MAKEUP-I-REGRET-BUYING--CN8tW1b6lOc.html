video is going to be all about products
that I regret buying so I do have a
regret series I will leave my playlist
listed down below about once a month I
do a video from the series either
products I regret buying don't regret
buying regret not buying don't regret
not buying regret not trying sooner all
that fun stuff so I have a bunch of
videos in this playlist I'm like I said
today I'm going to be going through I
just have a couple items here that I
purchased recently that I feel some
regrets about that I'm gonna chat with
you about them so if you want to see if
my makeup regrets why don't we go ahead
and get started so first up on my list I
just kind of keep a running list of
these and then once I get usually around
like five or six product so I'll go
ahead and film a video and this was the
first item on my new list for this video
and it was from a couple months back but
it was the beauty lash lucky bag now I
did do a video here on YouTube unboxing
my beauty lish lucky bag I'll leave it
listed down below I think this was back
around January and I just I was
disappointed in the bag for a couple
different reasons and not everything
necessarily has to do with what came and
the bag but it was kind of like my
circumstances at that time too and it
just kind of all made me it just kind of
all culminated into one like big giant
regret when it came to the Beauty lish
lucky bag so if you're not familiar I
think maybe it's once a year towards the
end of the year that beauty lush does
these lucky bags and you can purchase
one online and basically it's just a
mystery bag you'll get I think there's
like a certain dollar amount that each
bag will have and it'll be all brands
that are sold on the Beauty lish website
you know Charlotte Tilbury and Too Faced
and Becca and you know all these brands
that are sold on beauty less you'll have
certain items in your lucky bag and
there's two different sizes the lucky
bags that you can do there's a smaller
one which is $75 and there's also a
larger one which i think is over $100 i
think it's like 125 but your dollar
amount is larger and i put this in a
will i buy it video a lot of these
regret videos I kind of have as like a
follow-up to my will I buy in videos
because that's where I kind of talk
about did I make a purchase which
category did it fall into did I not make
a purchase do I regret enough
buying it you know or do I regret or do
I not regret passing over at that sort
of thing but I put it in my will i buy
it video and I was like I think I'm
gonna do it this year you know I watch
everybody's unboxings last year and it
seemed like so many people were excited
and they got some really good things and
a lot of the bags I was like oh my gosh
I want that bag and so I decided to go
ahead and do it and when I got my bag I
was fairly disappointed with what was
inside and you know I remember that I
got like a sheet mask and um I got a
Wayne Goss brush
I got a lipstick from Jeffrey star and I
got a Natasha de Nona like glow liquid
glow thing and then I also got this
palette here this is from a busy art one
of the theory pellets in nuance I
believe it is yeah and it just was kind
of a bummer to me because there was like
certain brains that I don't really use
in there or items that I don't really
use like the Natasha Genoa glow liquid
glow I know that's really big especially
right now but I'm still not even though
that's like the trend
I still don't use those types of
products so I ended up selling a lot of
things on my Poshmark because I didn't
even open them swatch them use them
anything the only item that I kept out
of there was the fizzy art theory
palette and honestly I've used it a
couple times and I'm not like the
biggest fan of it I think these are
either the $30 of the $45 I think these
ones are the $45 which is crazy to me
but you know if you think about
everything with a better side to keep in
the bag I paid $75 for this which is
kind of a bummer you know I was able to
sell a couple things on Poshmark I did
sell them for a lot cheaper though you
know since I got a discount on the bag
too I had him listed at cheaper prices
and everything so I think I was just you
know I was just disappointed it was for
me personally and I think a hard thing
with the with the beauty lish lucky bags
is you know some people are commenting
on my video like I would love to have
have your bag and I'm watching other
people's videos who are disappointed in
their bags and I'm like I would have
loved her bag you know it's just a
gamble and I think and I knew that going
into it of course you know that up front
going into it you're not picking out
what is in your bag and I knew that and
it was the risk that I took so I'm not
blaming anybody else or anything but I
think what I realized is that I think 75
helped $75 is too big of a
gamble for me to take on makeup you know
it's not like you're $10 tipsy bag it's
not even the boxy charm which is I think
like 22 or 23 dollars or something it's
75 dollars and you also pay for shipping
so I think the total price was eighty
two dollars so eighty two dollars for
only one item in there that I kept and
that I used that's a bummer so I think
next year I don't have plans to get the
beauty leash bag because it's just too
big of a risk if it if it works and you
get items in there that you love and
you're excited about that's so freaking
fantastic but if you don't that's a lot
of money that kind of went down the
drain and I think when I mentioned like
my circumstances I received the bag in
the mail the day after my husband lost
his job and so you know we're in like a
state of panic and we're so upset and
it's like can we even pay our bills
we're losing our health insurance and I
just bought an 82 dollar bag of makeup
that I didn't know what was inside you
know I feel like I remember like opening
the bag and just feeling like you are so
stupid and you know it just puts the
circumstances at that time and I just
did not help anything but I feel like
I'm always gonna hold on to that feeling
now so that's that's another reason why
I just kind of regretted it the timing
was so terrible for my personal life and
yeah it was just bad so I think next
year when the butyl ish lucky when it
gets announced I will not do it I think
it's just too much money to put the risk
on and I feel like now I just have like
bad juju surrounding the village like
you bag that I wouldn't be able to do it
but you know I tried it it just it
didn't work for me it works for so many
people but unfortunately that one was a
big regret for me I have a couple lip
products that I regret buying this one
here is from Fenty beauty and it's one
of the mademoiselle lipsticks and this
is in the shade up to no good I like the
packaging on it I think it's cute I
think this was like an $18 lipstick I
want to say this is what it looks like
here and it's a really interesting kind
of like peachy orange color I did a
lipstick declutter recently and I
decided to keep this one because the
color is more unique in my collection
but I truly don't really like the
formula on this one it's
very it's a drive formula it goes on the
lips nice like it feels nice when it
goes on but it is a matte lipstick and
it just dries very awkwardly on my lips
I do have dry lips I'm especially when
we're in the winter time which you know
we're coming out of so I was wearing
this a lot in the colder months and they
just looked bad on my lips so the reason
I kept it in the decluttr was yeah you
know this is the only one that I have
from that collection so sometimes it's
nice for comparison wise yeah it's a
color I don't have but I think one of
the biggest reasons that I bought the
lipstick and I decided to keep the
lipstick is that Finke Beauty is a brand
that you get a lot of flack for if you
don't love everything from the brand if
you don't try everything from the brand
you don't fall in love with everything
from the brand a lot of people come at
you and they come at you really hard so
I'm like nervous talking about this
because I know people are gonna say mean
things in my comments but it's been
interesting because there's been a
couple videos floating around that I've
seen I know I've seen LLS do it for sure
I can leave her video link down below
but talking about brands that you're not
allowed not to like and I feel like
fenty is one of those brands and I mean
do I like fin t as a brand yeah and I
think rihanna is the bomb I think what
she created is really cool and obviously
Fenty's done a lot of really awesome
things in the beauty community but that
doesn't mean that I have to love every
single product and that I can or will
order can afford or want to try every
single product that they come out with
and I I just I don't know so I felt like
that kind of went into me purchasing
this lipsticks I was like I didn't
really love the foundation and oh my
goodness did I really hear it from that
I think I even tried it on in a video
and you could tell it didn't look good
on my dry skin a matte foundation didn't
look great on my dry skin that's not
shocking a lot of them don't and people
are just tearing into me left and right
and I'm like what is going on here so I
think that kind of played into why I
decided to purchase it is almost like
one I have a Fendi lipstick like don't
be mad at me
and then when
to cluttering it us like oh my gosh if I
declutter a 50 lipstick people are going
to rip me a new one
but again I do like the color I think
it's a unique color but I can't wear it
for long periods of time because
otherwise my lips just look crazy like
they're gonna crack off but I kind of
regret doing that because I feel like I
regret every I regret letting those
comments get to me you know that's my
biggest regret when it comes to that
comes to this I regret letting those
comments get under my skin to the point
where I feel like it influenced my
purchases if that makes sense so it's
kind of what I think about the Fendi
lipstick and then also another one that
I regret buying is the dose of colors a
lip gloss I purchased at one of their
lip glosses from all the beauty in honey
I'm home
I actually declared it in my lip gloss
declutter and I sent it off to a friend
so I don't have it anymore in my
collection and since I had used it I
wasn't gonna put it on my Poshmark or
put it in a giveaway or anything so I
just sent it over to a friend for them
to try I'm not a big big lipgloss person
I've kind of been wearing them more
recently but I'm just not I've mostly
gravitate towards a liquid lipsticks so
I'm not a big gloss person but I still
paid like the $17 or something for the
dose of colors of glosses which is
pretty pricey and I was really
disappointed that I didn't like it so it
was just a little bit too thick for me
and a little bit too sticky and the
color like it was very nicely pigmented
for a lip gloss it wasn't very sheer I
mean it had good color to it but it was
kind of like that it was like a brown
orange almost that just is not
flattering on my skintone and I was just
so bummed like the moment I put it on I
was like shoot but I love dose of colors
I love dose of colors liquid lipsticks
they're some of my favorites so I was
like no you got this you're gonna make
this work like put it over certain
lipsticks your going to love it and I
just ended up not loving it then it was
too late to take it back to all this so
I declared it sending to a friend
hopefully they liked it more than I did
but yeah that was a bummer one of my
newer purchases that I regret buying
this will probably come to no surprise
has been watching my videos lately is
the Sunday Riley influence our
foundation man I'm so bummed about that
foundation I returned it I don't have it
anymore I took it back to Sephora I
exchanged
for the coverfx power-play foundation
but i did a video where i was putting it
on i did like my sephora vib sale haul
try on video and you could tell that I'm
like oh I'm not sure I'm not sure about
this foundation I did also review it
I'll have those videos linked down below
and I just said it did not work out well
for me it's not very good coverage wise
it says it's medium to full coverage
it's like the light to medium coverage
it it kind of it seemed to transfer it
seemed to be coming off my face after
just a couple hours and is breaking up
in weird places
it was settling into any and every line
on my skin it seemed like no matter how
I applied it or the primers that I used
it just was not a very long wearing
foundation and it just didn't look super
flattering on me as the time progressed
it was one of those foundations that
like when I put it on and got the rest
of my makeup on like for the next hour
like I looked really good like hour to
two hours like I looked good I felt like
my skin looked good I well it felt nice
on my skin it felt nice and lightweight
nothing felt too heavy or too cakey on
me but there was just so many cons that
I just couldn't justify keeping it think
it was $42 and like I said I exchanged
it for the cover FX power play I did it
for some questions recently and based on
first impressions I liked that one a lot
more I have it on again today I can
leave that one down below but that one
was $44 but I bought the influencer
foundation in the VIP sale so I did get
a little bit of a discount on it but I
still ended up taking it back because it
just it was no good and I was super
bummed about that because I was really
really looking forward to that
foundation I just have one more item
left here on my list as another item
that I purchased in the vib sale and
unfortunately it's the Anasazi Beverly
Hills that bronzer in Thani so I still
have mine but I'm actually going into
Ulta tomorrow and I'm planning on
returning this and there's a couple
items that I want to check out and see
if they're in start Ulta including that
new Urban Decay setting powder I'm
thinking maybe I could exchange it for
this but unfortunately this is just a
color thing the color match did not look
good on me at all it pulled more orange
on me and some people I also did review
this and I mentioned that some people
said the anasazi bronzers are supposed
to be more red but just to be more of a
nap
troll bronzer on the skin like you've
been out in the Sun but unfortunately on
me I just felt like it was pulling
orange and I didn't feel very confident
when I was wearing this bronzer and I
just felt like I was spending so much
time really blending it out and it it
just I didn't feel confident wearing
this so why keep a makeup product that
you don't feel confident with I do have
two lights shining out because
unfortunately it's raining outside right
now so I don't think it's coming across
on camera as dark as it is and this was
one of those things like I opened it was
like oh I don't think that's gonna be my
shade and I think this is like the
second lightest one I thought that's
what I chose you know some people are
saying I could exchange it for a
different color but another part that
goes into me regretting buying this is I
wasn't thinking clearly and I knew that
the Marc Jacobs Omega fantastic bronzer
was going to be coming back in stock I
knew it was coming back and just when I
was making my list for the VIP sell was
one of those things right I was so
excited and I had this on my love list
and I was like oh my gosh yes I should
get that one and I added it to my cart
and if I just would have stopped and
like thought about it for a second I
would have remembered that a week after
the vib sale or whatever it was the Marc
Jacobs bronzer was coming back in stock
and that was a $49 bronzer luckily I was
still able able to purchase it with the
you know the special access Bab Rouge or
whatever so I still got the 15% off
which was good but if I would have
remembered that
I would have not have also purchased
this and because I purchased the Too
Faced natural face palette in the vib
sell as well and that has two brothers
in it so I mean how about for bronzers
in a one-week period two-week period
like that silly and if I just would have
calmed down for a second and remembered
that I would not have purchased this one
anyways so when people are saying I
could exchange it for a different color
I totally could but it doesn't make
sense for me to purchase that many
browsers at one time my bronzer
collection is fairly small beside our
unit right now it's a fairly small
collection compared to other parts of my
makeup collection and I would like to
keep it that way and so that's just too
many bronzers at one time so I would
rather just return this and exchange it
for something else and that I want a
little bit more so it kind of goes into
both of that I just I wasn't thinking
clearly I knew I was gonna try to
purchase that Marc Jacobs bronzer I did
get it so
and also just the color much you know if
the coloring would have worked on me and
I would have really loved it I still
would have kept it but because it also
just doesn't look great on me I'm gonna
go ahead and return this tomorrow when I
head over to my Ulta but after that that
is going to be all of my makeup
purchases recently that I regret buying
I guess so that is everything for
today's video chatting over some of my
makeup regrets recently I hope that you
enjoyed hearing all of my reasonings
behind why I regretted these purchases
or why I decided to return or exchange
at certain things I'd love to know if
you have anything recently that you
regret buying and of course my regret
