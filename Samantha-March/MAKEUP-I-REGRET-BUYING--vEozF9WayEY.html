today's video is going to be all about
some makeup and I regret buying bummer
I'm really excited to be doing another
video in my regret series so I feel like
I haven't done one for a while I do have
a whole regret playlist that I will
leave link down below about makeup that
I regret buying makeup that I regret not
buying makeup that I don't regret not
buying and all sorts of other fun things
I haven't done a makeup that I regret
buying in quite some time
and I got some products here that I want
to share with you that I'm pretty bummed
about so why don't we go ahead and jump
into it so like I said I haven't done
the makeup that I regret buying video in
quite some time and basically what I do
for my regrets series is I just
continually have a running list and then
when I feel like I have enough items on
it and I can find the time to make the
video then I go ahead and make the video
so some of these items are going to be
quite older starting with the first one
which is the urban decay and make it
heat pallets do not have the pallet to
show you because I did end up returning
edge so I'm thankful that I was able to
come I'm on you back I purchased it from
Sephora I returned it within I don't
know two or three weeks or something I
did try it you know a handful of times I
really tried to get rid of my all
because I really really want it to like
that palette there was so much hype
around it and I kind of regret buying it
because I know that I bought into the
hype so many people were so excited
about it and it just kind of like rubbed
off on me and rubbed off on me
and I in my will I buy it when I was
discussing his Urban Decay Naked heat
palette I kind of like talked myself
into it in that video and I was like you
know what I'm just gonna do it so I
purchased it I think it was $54 which is
really expensive for an eyeshadow
palette I typically it's hard for me to
spend that much money on eyeshadow
palette but I did it so I was super
bummed of that I didn't love it I didn't
find it to be super pigmented for me I
didn't find it to blend very easily that
was pretty disappointed because all of
the shimmers really needed a lot of help
in order to have pigmentation I really
had to be wetting down my brush in order
to keep the shimmers to show so overall
the Urban Decay Naked heat was just a
complete mess for me and I was super
bummed about it but I know that I have a
lot of other palettes in my collection
that are similar shades to the Urban
Decay Naked heat so I was okay saying
goodbye to it
and getting my money back definitely do
regret buying into the hype on that one
I know that's why I did it but it's okay
all's well that ends well the next
product that I want to talk about that I
regret buying is the Kim kardashian-west
and Kylie cosmetics the collaboration
they released this 4-piece collection of
creme liquid lipstick is the proper term
for these philippi is right here you
guys know I'm such a nude lipstick lover
I have a problem when it comes to nude
lipsticks I love wearing them I actually
had a pink lipstick on before this and I
was like mmm nah and I took it off and
put a nude on because I love nudes so
when I saw this I was like oh my gosh
I'm so curious
I thought the packaging was fantastic I
thought it was super cute and I was like
you know what I'm just gonna do it I I
completely wanted to the hype on that
one everybody lost their mind that Kim
was collaborating with Kylie cosmetics
and I was like yes I'm gonna get it too
and it's gonna be fantastic and I'm
gonna love it to be honest I don't
actually hate the products in here I
really don't and right before I started
filming I opened this up and I actually
had this one right here which is Kim
that was in my purse I haven't used it
in quite some time but I found it buried
at the bottom of my purse because I have
worn that one that one is definitely my
favorite in the collection I didn't
absolutely hate these I thought the
formula was really interesting because
it's kind of like so how it says it's a
creme a liquid lipstick it's almost like
a lip gloss slash lipstick it was a very
different type of formula but I didn't
hate it I didn't actually hate the
colors in here I thought all the nudes
are very pretty they were pretty similar
to one another as well but I didn't mind
it I thought that each had differences
you know one was more peachy one was
more pink one was where nude one was
more darker etc I actually did like the
product but why I regret buying it is
because I regretted giving my money to
Kim kardashian-west and Kylie cosmetics
that is what I honestly regret about
this purchase this was the final straw
with me and Kylie cosmetics and this was
what encouraged me not to purchase
anything from Kim kardashian-west beauty
when she came out with her own makeup
line I purchased from Kylie cosmetics in
the past I've never really had anything
good to say about their customer service
about their shipping times their weight
times etc etc I think it's absolutely
ridiculous and this was no exception
after nine days I finally contacted
Kylie cosmetics and was like my order
hasn't even shipped what is going on and
I just got back with the standard you
know reply email like hi we don't care
about you thank you so much for your
money
Kylie's putting that towards for private
jets so I thought like that's basically
the email response that I got back and I
was like you know what Samantha that was
so dumb
that was so dumb I had complained about
Kylie cosmetics in the past about the
shipping of the customer service etc and
then what do I do I go and buy another
freaking item and then I'm in the exact
same boat and I'm like that was dumb so
while I enjoy what is in here and I
actually thought they were pretty decent
products I just don't even want to keep
them in my collection I regret doing it
I regret buying into the hype I regret
giving my money to the kardashian-jenner
's when I could have been supporting
indie brands or other brands that I love
way more and that you know really not
get out of the park when it comes to
customer service so that was a regret
you guys been watching my channel for a
while you probably won't be as surprised
to see this one in here but another item
that I regret buying this is from my
anasazi Beverly Hills this was in
collaboration with Nicole Guerrero and
it is the Glo kit first of all that
happened that was a bummer I think this
was what my v Glo kit from Anastacio
that came to me shattered I just can't
seem to uh I can't seem to get the glow
kits right I don't know what it is but I
get so many broken Club hits from
anasazi Beverly Hills and it's
devastating so my 1 for 3 is completely
gone fortunately for me that one wasn't
going to look best on my skin anyways so
it wasn't like real devastating besides
this just looks ridiculous and every
time I was using it in like a Instagram
tutorial everyone was like what's wrong
with 1:43 did you not like that one like
oh it was shattered the bat that was a
bit of a bummer but the she's just did
not work for me I wanted to love this
one so much because I do really enjoy
Nicole Guerrero I love watching her
YouTube videos I
like the Anastasio coil kits I have that
glow I really enjoy it I also have
sweets which that one is also in pieces
of as well but I really enjoy it when I
can kind of put it back together I
really enjoy the shades on my skin but
this one I thought was just very
different from those other two o'clock
it's I thought a lot of the shades were
very glittery and I'm 30 years old I
can't just be throwing glitter on my
face every day it just doesn't look good
on me it's just not my vibe so I know a
lot of other people really enjoy this
I'm gonna be putting some of these items
that I'm talking about in here into my
blog sale I do have a blog sale going on
right now if you watched my most recent
makeup declutter I did talk about
selling some of the items that I
personally have bought for myself and in
this video I have bought everything
that's why it's makeup that I regret
buying it none of this is PR or anything
like that I did buy everything so some
of the items I'll be putting in my blog
sale I can't decide if I should put this
one in there though because the 143 is
completely going but I don't know I
don't know you guys can let me know if
you think this would be good to put in
the blog say like unfortunately even
though I was really excited for this one
and I thought the shades were so so like
they look really beautiful in the pants
it just did not translate onto my skin I
just didn't think it was very flattering
on me so unfortunately after all of the
hassle and all of the trouble with this
glow kit I ended up not liking it so
that is a big big regret it did start
storming so I had to flip my ring light
so sorry if my lighting change but it
got really dark in here another item
that I regret buying from Tarte
cosmetics is that they're a unicorn
brush set I think this was called like
the make believe in yourself' brush set
the reason why I regret it is because a
lot of the brushes didn't work for me I
actually put two of them in my blog sale
and they were the first thing sold by
the way which I thought was really funny
really the only brush that I actually
really enjoyed from the set is this
blush brush right here I really really
like this brush it's very big and fluffy
it's super soft I love it for blush I
think it's awesome when I was doing my
brush to clutter I declared two of them
put him in my blog sale I decided to
keep these two eye brushes because I'm
like well you know I always need a
blending brush my blending brushes are
always dirty same thing with like a flat
shader brush
I always need them they're always dirty
I use these types of brushes on a
regular basis but I just got a lot of
new brushes like a lot i buy a lot of
brushes a lot and i buy a lot of
blending and flat shader brush
so I'm like that was I shouldn't even
kept see it was like after I got done
with my makeup brush the clutter I was
like I probably could have too cluttered
more I could have done better and I
think I'm going to go ahead and just
declutter these or I'll put these in the
blog sale - yeah I'll put these in the
blog sale because there are nice brushes
I just don't need them
I have someone who brushes I don't
didn't need them so I regret buying it
because it was like $40 or just over $40
for the whole set and I really am just
keeping this one so that was $40 for one
brush so that's a regret a foundation
that I regret buying that I'm super
bummed about is from Estee Lauder this
is the double we're at nude freshwater
foundation this is like $42 foundation
and unfortunately I did not love it I
used this in one of my most recent kind
of makeup tutorial type of videos I
think it was either I get ready with me
or testing new makeup so I'll have that
one link down below that I'm using this
but I kind of talked about how I didn't
really love the foundation the worst
part for me to be honest but the $42
foundation is that there was no pump at
someone's video once and they were
talking about the devil where water
fresh foundation they didn't own it so I
went back and watched the video they did
not own it yet but they said in the
video Estee Lauder finally put a pump on
the foundation and that's fantastic they
needed to do that for a while and I was
like oh cool so when I was looking at
Ulta and I found this one I was like I
remember someone just saying they had to
pump on it and that was a big deal so I
don't know
I mean don't just listen to one person I
guess but that for some reason I was
thinking I had pumps of completely
caught off guard when I went and opened
this foundation I was like wait what the
heck I just had a really difficult time
because this is a water foundation it
means it's very liquidy so when you're
trying to pour it out it just is kind of
a disaster I was either using too much
product I was using too less product I
couldn't seem to get the right amount
and I was always making a mess the fun
is to be pretty streaky on my face when
using a Beauty Blender and another thing
that I noticed about this that I didn't
mention in that past video is that it
wears away very easily I never really
noticed my
Foundation wearing a way right here like
when I wear sunglasses I've never really
noticed that with any of my other
foundations but I noticed the one day I
was wearing this and I was outside for a
while I took off my sunglasses and the
hole right here on the sunglasses was
completely full of foundation and I had
like two white marks right there that
was like oh I'm going to put my
sunglasses back on so I don't know it
wasn't really working out for me I
really really wanted to love this
foundation I was going to return it but
I'm gonna give it a second chance
because this is so funny timing wise I
went to my peal box today and there was
a foundation pump in there and I'm
looking at it I'm like did I order a
foundation pump like in my sleep was I
drunk oh where is it pump coming from
and I finally found the little note that
came with it and it said it to my
favorite youtuber from Deborah happy
pumping lol and that made me laugh so
hard
so Deborah thank you so much this is
awesome it looks like it is a Mac
foundation pump which a lot of people
are saying in that video get the Mac
Foundation pump and I'm like I don't
want to because that's like twelve
dollars so then we're talking over fifty
bucks for her foundation that I'm not
completely sold on right now I don't
necessarily love the way it applies and
look love the way it looks on me so why
am I gonna go spend more money so
instead of returning it I'm going to put
the pump on it Thank You Deborah I'm
gonna put the pump on it and we're gonna
see if we can make it work that'll help
fix some of the issues that I'm having
with you know the amount of product to
use and all that and not making a mess
so big thank you to Deborah I'm gonna
give this one a second try but at first
I really thought I was gonna return this
one so second chance so the next one
that I have this is pretty this is
pretty embarrassing this is from Benefit
Cosmetics this is their Bravo
conditioning primer this is supposed to
be a primer for your eyebrows and also
help grow your eyebrows is what the
applicator looks like I don't know if
you'll be able to see it real well on
camera but it has these like tiny like
little raised bumps on there and you
just run it you click up you click it up
right here and then you run the product
back and forth it says its nutrient rich
primer for fuller looking brows this was
$28
twenty-eight dollars and I don't regret
it because I don't think it works or I
don't like it because this works
I regret buying it because I don't need
something like this I don't need this I
actually have fairly full brows without
having any sort of brow product in them
I have pretty full and pretty defined
brows as they are I typically just use a
pencil and run it through my brows to
help kind of fill in sparse areas and
shape them a little bit but they're
there I started using this and my brows
were out of control they were out of
control this actually does work if you
have very sparse brows and you want to
grow them I most definitely would
suggest this for you because I thought
that it worked but I didn't need it if
you guys haven't following me for a
while you might have been on my journey
of brows when I first started at YouTube
I didn't do my brows I owned nothing
nothing for my brows and I started doing
like tutorials and such on Instagram and
just ruined people's days months weeks
years because I didn't do my brows like
I would feel so bad because somebody
would be having a great day you know
they got asked out by the cute guy that
got an A on their test they won the
freaking lottery and then they come onto
Instagram and they see me without doing
my brows and it's all ruined it is all
ruined for them and I felt terrible you
know I felt so guilty for so long that I
finally started doing my brows and I'm
just kidding of course but I have since
started doing my brows and finding some
of the brow products that I absolutely
love and it's kind of fun to play around
with them and like trying to do
different styles I'm not very good at
that yet I can I can really just got
like fill them in and go from there but
I don't mind doing my brows anymore but
I felt like I bought this because I was
like kind of giving in to the pressures
of this whole freakin brow game and that
is so silly this is a product that I
don't need because of how my brows
naturally are I don't need something
like this I kind of like bought into
like trying to be someone else or
something because so many people were
talking about this there are so many
videos about it people like everybody
needs this I'm like yeah me too and then
I bought it and then my brows had like
there
zip code because there were so many of
them and I was like that was just that
was just ridiculous this is $28 $28 I'm
gonna put I'm gonna put this in my blog
sale if anybody has sparse brows I think
it really does work
it just was silly for me to buy it the
final items I'm going to talk about are
all lip products and I feel like out of
everything
I really dislike regretting buying
lipsticks because I'm a lipstick addict
I'm a lipstick order I'm a lipstick
junkie I love all the lipsticks so when
lipsticks don't work out for me for
whatever reason it's just it's like a
personal failure you know I just I
really get upset with myself
fortunately with all the lipsticks I'm
about to mention the only reason that
they did not work out for me was because
the shades don't look great on me all
right don't particularly love the shade
on me so that to me is even more of a
personal failure especially when I'm
picking them out and I do I do a wrong
job picking out my shade I get really
upset these are all supposed to be nudes
nudes are my favorite you guys I'm just
getting upset all over again so the
first one is from Sigma Beauty this is
part of their new wildflower collection
I bought the eye shadow palette it has a
shadows and a blush and a highlight in
it I love that one they had two lipstick
options and this one looked more like
the traditional nude that I love it's
called barely blooming fortunately it is
just not a good looking shade on me so
this is what it looks like a reminder I
do have my ring light on so sometimes
swatches can look a little bit different
and when I have to use an artificial
light much definitely looks very pink
but on me it was basically like the
concealer lips it just did not look good
it was too kind of like of a beige nude
and I was super bummed about that so
unfortunately I really do enjoy this
thing my lips I have another one I think
it's really pretty
unfortunately this one did not work out
for me because the shade did not look
good I just bought this one and I was
just talking about on snapchat the other
day that I was really really bummed out
that the shade didn't work for me this
is from bareMinerals this is one of
their I think it's called their gen
matte nudes a lot of people have been
talking about these it is a liquid
lipstick a lot of people have been
talking about these and saying how much
they love the formula they have so many
different shades in there so many shades
and I don't know why I picked this one
it's in wing right yes
this isn't wink and you know like a lot
of times they have little descriptions
under the names
this one said it was like the perfect
pink and I thought yes and I don't know
why I did that because I need to stop
going pink I don't I like pink on me but
I don't love it how I love nudes on me
I'm more like nude brown nude not so
much pink nude all the time and when
it's too light like this one is I just
didn't love it I wore this in believe it
was yesterday's video the one about Ulta
and I had to put a lip gloss over it
that had a bit of a darker pigmentation
to it because it was just too late on me
so that one is the swatch of the
bareMinerals
wink right there it felt like a really
nice formula I was very impressed with
it but unfortunately the color the color
did not work out for me so that is a
bummer and then the last two I'm super
I'm super bummed about these you guys
and again it's just because the shades
didn't work on me but this is from the
dose of colors the Katy and desi
collaboration to nude lipsticks along
with the eyeshadow palette and
unfortunately well I didn't end up
absolutely loving the eyeshadow palette
I am gonna keep it and you know I can
play around with it and have fun with it
every once in a while but I actually
like cannot wear these I can't
they look so bad on my skin the first
one is in no shade this one kind of
reminded me a little bit of what the
Sigma lipstick was doing where it just
is like too nude too much of a beige
knew too much of like a concealer on me
that one is no shade and it just like
look at how light all of these are man
such a bummer the next one is more
creamer please this is one that I wore
in a video that everybody liked you know
it was like again one of those things
where everybody's having a great day
everything is going well they click on
my youtube video they see a lipstick
that doesn't look great on me and there
boom - brand that's like how I felt like
I played people so sorry about that but
this one is more creamier please this
one it looks really beautiful in a
swatch and when I first watch it I was
like oh I'm gonna totally love this one
more I could tell right away when i
swatched these two that I was going to
gravitate towards more creamier please
because I thought okay that's a little
bit darker it's a little bit more my
style
it's not look better on me I don't know
if it's something with my undertone that
makes it not work for me or what happens
but it almost pulls like a weird like
orange brown on me it I don't know it's
not great it's not great and I totally
understand you know like some people
have comments in the video that I was
wearing it you know just like Oh
lipstick doesn't look super great on you
but you know cute hair or you know
things like that but other people are
like take the lipstick off girl I was
like okay and I knew it didn't look
great on me and like I was responding
back to some of the comments like yeah I
know it didn't look great but I wanted
to still give it a chance that's a brand
new lipstick like I can't wear it at all
that's kind of a bummer but I would not
be able to wear these I'll probably put
these in my blog sale I've only worn
each of them one time and I knew
immediately from that one time that they
just do not vibe with my skin so if you
have one like mine or undertone like
mine or anything like that I would not
recommend these for you because they
really just didn't look great on me and
I was super bummed about it I love dose
of colors Katy does here are some of my
absolute favorite youtubers out there I
really wanted to be able to support so
these just didn't look good on my skin
there's just no other way around it the
formula was good I enjoyed it but
unfortunately I just can't pull off the
colors okay so that is going to be
everything for my makeup that I regret
buying I hope that you guys enjoyed this
video and seeing some of my makeup
regrets some of the items that didn't
work out for me let me know in the
comments if some of your recent and

blog sale because a lot of these items I
will probably put up in there in case

the details and everything I'm like how
