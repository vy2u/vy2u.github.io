today's video is going to be all about
some products that I regret bye
uh yeah it is that time to go through
some products that I'm like ah boo wish
I hadn't have bought that so if you want
to see some products I regret buying
while we'll go ahead and get started
Before we jump into it I do have a
regret series playlist I have a series
of products I regret buying don't regret
buying regret not buying all kinds of
fun stuff so I will have that playlist
listed down below but the first products
that I want to talk about here are these
Anasazi of Beverly Hills lipsticks I was
gonna say liquid lipsticks is they're
not liquid lipsticks her regular matte
lipsticks alright so the first shade I
bought I believe it was from Sephora and
it was called dead roses the first came
out I was intrigued by them I have tried
her liquid lipsticks and I don't love
them and I was like well maybe more of
her regular formula I would enjoy and it
supposed to be more of a matte finish
I like matte lipsticks so I was like
okay I'll give it a shot so I bought
dead roses and I was like oh no like the
first time I was putting it on I was
like why will it not apply easily to my
lips it's because it's a matte formula
but a regular lipstick i I find this not
a whole lot but I have seen this with
other lipsticks like this it just is
hard to apply because it doesn't apply
creamy it doesn't apply smooth this
lipstick kind of like skip skip skip
across my lips and just looks kind of
crazy and it's really hard to get like
an even application and just to make my
lips look nice with this lipstick and I
was like ah shoot like I really wanted
to like this lipstick and then because
I'm a genius I was like I'll just buy
another one
I'll just buy another one and give it a
shot like this is probably the one I
really regret buy why would I buy
another one I don't know but in my mind
I was like well this shade is more of
like a I mean it's called dead roses
it's like a deep rosy color but like a
little bit of like on the grayish side
almost and I was like maybe it was just
too different of a color maybe I need
more of a nude color and then I'll enjoy
it more why I think this I don't know
but I did so I bought another one same
thing
same thing same problems doesn't apply
easily to the lips the application is
just kind of a mess on me and overall I
just don't love this lipstick why I
bought two I don't know I'm disappointed
with myself the second shade I bought
was in buff but these are lipsticks that
I definitely do regret buying I regret
that I bought another one even though I
didn't love the first one but I felt
like I was hearing people say really
good things about these when they first
came out and I was kind of having that
moment of like why don't I love it too
surely if I just buy another one I'm
going to love it then and that didn't
really work out for me so I feel kind of
silly but I'm here to admit my makeup
mistakes that yeah the Anastasia matte
lipsticks just are not for me so next
time I have a product here from dose of
colors and I love dose of colors I love
their lipsticks I love their eyeshadow
palettes so this one kind of hurts but I
really honestly regret buying this this
is one of their ideal duo's now I will
say I think that this is really pretty
and I've created some pretty fun eye
looks with it I enjoy that what it is is
a duo for your eyes like the name might
suggest so the top here you pop it off
it has this little tiny mirror which I
know that other beauty bloggers can do
their makeup like this I can't but for
them that would probably work out really
well and then you have this kind of like
like a base shade and I got mine in the
shade mint to be this was part of their
mint collection so the they are like the
minty green shades so this is kind of
like a base and it's kind of sticky so
you apply it to your eye all over and
then you twist it off here and then you
have loose pigment I kind of want to be
careful because I don't want to spill it
everywhere but you have a loose pigment
and it's really beautiful it's I've done
like mermaid eyes with this when I want
that mermaid I look I can reach into
this and create a really pretty look but
my problem is is that I really don't
feel like this is all that different
from just a regular eye shadow
especially in like the Jacqueline helm
morphe palette I can get a very similar
look with the eyeshadows in there and
even just other eyeshadow palettes that
have kind of like that mint green
shimmer to it I can get that in there
and I typically reach for them versus
going in a drawer and grabbing this out
and laying the
bass and then coming in with the pigment
it just is like too time-consuming and
it's not me I know that I'm more of a
palette girl I like reaching into a
pellet and creating a full I look sure
sometimes I come in and like top it off
with glitter or something but most of
the times I'm going into one palette and
that's just my personal makeup
preference so I should have known that I
should have known that going into it
that simply because of how my makeup
style is and my makeup preferences that
we wouldn't have gotten along do I still
think it's pretty yes and I get the
concept behind it but like one of my
biggest regrets with this is that it was
$25 $25 for one oh my gosh it's like
sometimes I stop and think about it I'm
like Samantha I get it together
girlfriend so I definitely do regret it
for that because $25 it just continually
sits on my desk and I don't reach for it
and I get so disappointed with myself
when I look at it cuz I'm like you knew
yourself better I think it was just
because I was so hyped on dose of colors
and I wanted to try so many different
things but I just decided to try this
and I get it and I it's a nice product
and I'm sure it will work for people if
that is more of your makeup preference
but for me it's not and that was 25
dollars uh but next up I don't have this
product any longer but I bought some
lashes from Tarte cosmetics and
unfortunately I really did not enjoy
them I think maybe I put this in a
makeup monthly and I mentioned the
lashes that I just did not love and I
actually got rid of the lashes I was
like you know what I'm not even going to
keep them around my collection I try to
him I think three different times and
each time I was like these are just not
for me
I could immediately tell the first time
I went to apply them I didn't even like
the feel of them like the feel like
something was off for me
I just did not love them and I had a lot
of troubles getting them on my eyes
especially the inner corner just the way
the band was they just did not work well
for me I did get it in a set and it had
like their lash adhesive and I think
maybe like a mascara or something like
that and everything else was fine for me
but those lashes like that was kind of
the main reason why I was purchasing the
set was because I really wanted to try
out her lashes and they were just a
no-go for me I did didn't even want to
keep them around in Michael
and I was like nope I have too many
other lashes that I love so much I'm
kicking them out of my last jar so
unfortunately in the turret lashes yeah
and it just sucks because I bought a set
for it so I don't know like I could have
bought I could have just purchased one
pair of lashes and tried but instead I
got a set and probably spent more money
so it's like ah Samantha not cool
girlfriend but next up I have a dry
shampoo foam here this is from the brand
way okay
so way is a bit of a newer brand and I
know there's a lot of hype around the
brand and I think because Jen Atkin
who's the owner like she's like friends
with a bunch of celebrities including
the Kardashians so you constantly and
also big beauty influencers so you
constantly see way being recommended and
put out there and people started talking
a lot about this dry shampoo foam and
I'm someone I have dry shampoo in my
hair today I think I'm on day for hair I
only wash my hair about twice a week so
a lot of times I rely on dry shampoo for
like days three and four and I feel like
I've just been on the hunt for the best
with dry shampoo and I still have not
been able to find it I purchased this
one because a lot of people were talking
about it and it's really interesting
because when you squeeze it out it's
foam it looks like a mousse and then
when you put it in your hair it's kind
of crazy because it does make your hair
wet but then it's like your hair is dry
it's I don't as really bizarre but to me
it didn't actually do anything besides
like maybe give my hair a little bit of
volume which is nice I do have
extensions and today but like maybe gave
it a little bit of volume and I have
really thin hair normally and so I was
excited about that but like as far as
like taking oils out of my hair and just
giving my hair as Jewish and making it
look revived it didn't really do
anything so I didn't really enjoy it I
believe this guy was $28 I purchased the
full size and I think they had a mini on
the Sephora website I'm not sure if they
still do or not but I was like why would
I have not have just purchased a mini
when I'm trying things out
I should just know like sort of like
haircare products on your skin care
products if I want to try something out
if they have a mini sized purchased the
mini like try it out first save a little
bit of money that's gonna be like one of
my resolutions here for 2018 like stop
buying full-size things when you're not
for sure if you're gonna enjoy them or
not because that's a bummer I mean it's
still it's probably
like up to here and so that was kind of
a $28 down the drain because I have not
to touch this since I decided it was a
no-go for me after I gave it enough
choice I was like yeah no I'm over it
another lip product in here this is from
makeup forever this is one of their
artists liquid matte lipsticks and mine
is in the shade 103 so I bought this
because I started to hear people like
using it quite a bit in it and like
tutorials and get ready with me and this
was a while ago I've been planning this
video for quite some time I just always
kind of have a running list and this was
one of the first things on there so I
purchased this quite some time ago and I
do like the color it's a nice like nude
pink I would say I like the color but
the formula does nothing for me and it
was twenty dollars and twenty dollars
that's more in my like expensive end for
liquid lipsticks so to pay twenty
dollars for a formula that I just don't
think is very good at all um it
definitely like I apply it and I could
sit down and film a video for 30 minutes
and when I get done it's already like
cracked on like the inner parts of my
lips and stuff it just doesn't last very
long on me and I find it to be really
really drying so I like the color but I
never reach for this lipstick because I
don't like the formula at all and I just
don't think it holds up so twenty
dollars on a liquid lipstick I didn't
enjoy is like ooh ooh that hurts so next
up I have two more products that I
returned no three more products that I
returned the last three or elf products
that I returned the next two are from
Tarte cosmetics so I purchased their
Park Avenue princess contour palette and
then I also purchased the clay plate 2
palette I purchased the contour palette
first I was really excited about it I
love face pallets contour pellets
browser pals
I'm really into face palettes so when I
saw it come out I thought the packaging
looks beautiful there was too like
setting powders in there there was
contour shades bronzer shades and I was
just excited for it so I purchased it
and I got it home and I was playing with
it and I was like okay like I like it
but it's super similar to the original
clay play palette which apparently is no
longer available but I was like oh I
think maybe it's too similar to the clay
play like does it make sense that I have
both of these and when I actually went
through and was like comparing it to the
clay play a it was just super similar
but also I found the shades in the clay
play palette to be even better so I was
like I just don't feel like it makes a
lot of sense for me to hold on to this
when I have something super similar but
also better at the same time so I ended
up returning it I did like their bet
there was setting shades and there
quickly like to use a setting powder
versus like a baking powder like loose
powder to set my under eyes with I like
that those were in the palette and you
don't get that with the clay play but
like I have pellets that I have that
option for so I decided to return it at
the $46 then I went on and I purchased
the clay play 2 palette I was so excited
for the clay play 2 because I love the
original clay play had eye shadows had
contours bronzers and then the clay play
2 was coming out with eyeshadows and
then also had a blush a bronzer and a
highlight I was like oh my gosh this is
gonna be like my perfect palette that's
truly what I thought of the clay play
too
and I went out immediately I purchased
the clay play - at the $46 and I got
home and I mean I have a video I'll
leave it link down below and I talked
about the clay play too for a while but
I was so upset with that palette and
that was kind of the first like inkling
towards Tarte that I was like what is
going on with this brand because
basically the it seemed like they had
just used the original clay play palette
and put a few different shades in there
like the shade names in the clay play -
were the exact same as the clay play one
that might not be a huge deal and I
totally understand that because a lot of
times I don't even look at shade names
it's not something I pay attention to
but it was kind of weird because in the
clay play - there's a shade called
onyx which is typically a black and in
the palette I don't remember what it was
but like a sparkly bronze shimmer and
I'm like what like the shades made sense
like the shape names in the clay play
made sense to what the shades were the
shades in the clay play - were just a
repeat of the clay play they didn't make
sense to the shades but also like seven
of the shades in the clay play - were
the same as the original clay play they
only switched out a few different shades
the bronzer was the same and then they
gave you a blush and highlight I'm like
I basically just bought the exact same
palette with a few switcheroos in there
what the heck did you just do Samantha
and so I returned it at $46 and I was
mad about it I liked the blush in there
but the highlight was like straight
glitter and it looked horrible on me but
I was like I
I just I just bought the freaking same
palette like what the heck and other
people are making videos about it and
trying to figure it out and there was
you know people were asking about it on
tart and all tart really said was Oh
people said they really liked the clay
play but they wanted more face shapes so
RiRi did it for you tada I'm like no you
didn't you try to play us like there was
something fishy about clay play too from
the very beginning and then obviously
what happened with the shape tape
foundation all of that stuff went down
but then but then people are now telling
me that the park Ave princess palette
which wasn't all matte palette people
are now saying that they're buying it
and there's two shimmer shades in it and
I'm like alright someone messaged me on
snapchat the other day they said did
your Park f princess have shimmer shades
in it and I said no and they said mine
has two shimmers and so I started
looking into it and now people are
saying their shimmers in there and I'm
like what is happening what are you
doing tart what is going on I'm getting
very confused and I've come on to my
youtube channel and I have said I'm not
supporting tart right now and I know a
lot of people there there's there's so
much stuff that happened with the shape
tape foundation and there's fingers
being pointed at everybody and all this
kind of craziness but I know people are
saying like it's unfair that I'm just
boycotting tart because of the shaped a
foundation and that is not true I'm not
purchasing from tart or supporting tart
right now because I feel like they're
doing some really weird things between
the park a princess contour palette the
clay play - palette the shape tape
Foundation which maybe is the same as
one of the tarts of old foundations
there's too much weird stuff going on
right now and I'm feeling very confused
and very conflicted about the brand and
that's why I've decided to stop
supporting them and stop making
purchases from them and it's just crazy
like once so much time I thought snap
about the shimmer shade it's not like
are you kidding me right now what is
going on here so I'd love to know if you
guys got the park a princess contour
palette is yours all matte does yours
have shimmers in it I'm completely
confused so those are two items I
returned to both of them to tart
they were both $46 I returned them both
and that was another big reason and just
when shaped a foundation came along and
everything would that happened and that
horrible PopSugar article I was like you
know what you've been feeling on the
fence for awhile you've been feeling
like something funny's going on here you
just need to put it on
right now I really regret it buying both
of those products and I was really glad
I think I purchased either one or both
from alt I can't remember and luckily I
was able to return it cuz I mean 46
times to like girlfriend wanted her
money back so those were regret whoo
okay whoo anyways moving on one less one
less product here but this one I also
did return it and this was the
maybelline superstay foundation it was
one of their new foundations I think it
was only like $12 I ended up returning
it because I was going to also to return
the clay plate to palette and I had just
bought that Maybelline foundation as
well and I was like you know if I had to
drive all the way to Ulta just to return
a $12 foundation I don't know if I would
have which why not I don't know it just
would have sat in my collection until I
threw it away but I was like well since
I'm already going to return a $46
product I might as well take this one
back as well I don't regret buying it
because it was a horrible foundation or
because it was so expensive or things
like that
I just bought it kind of on a whim I
love buying foundations and when I saw
Maybelline was coming out the new one I
was like ooh yes I think if I would have
waited just a little tiny bit and
started watching some of the reviews
that were coming in I would have
realized that it wasn't for me it is
actually a full coverage foundation but
I didn't mind I didn't mind the finish
that it gave to my skin but it oxidized
really bad on me and turned to me very
very orange and a lot of people have
said that about that foundation so I
think if I would have waited a little
bit and seeing the reviews come in I
would have been like ooh probably not
going to be the best foundation for me
but unfortunately just the color
matching and turning me orange and way
way dark okay
I took awhile though like I can remember
doing my makeup but like 9 o'clock in
the morning and then going getting ready
to film it like one being like whoa what
happened to my face so unfortunately
that one did not work out for me but
that was also another product that I
returned so I thought I would mention
that in the products that I regret
buying video but after that that's going
to do it for today's video
I guess so that is everything up or my
latest products of that I regret buying
video I hope that you guys enjoyed this
video or found it helpful or
entertaining in some way again I will

listed down below I'd love to know I

shouldn't have done that for any variety
of reason I mean the products in here is

for me and some because I just thought
something shady was going on and it made
me upset but I would love to know any of
