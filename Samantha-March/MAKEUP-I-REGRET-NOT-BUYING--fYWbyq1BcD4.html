today's video is going to be makeup that
I regret not buying so this is going to
be makeup that I decided not to purchase
and then I have had regrets about it
either because I still see people using
it all the time and talking about is how
much they loved it or it truly was a
product that I wanted to get and I
missed it like it sold out too fast you
know just that sort of thing but the
makeup products that I still think about
and think meaning I wish I would have
gotten that this video was really
requested since I did the first one that
kind of like this in the regret series I
think I might call it but I did a makeup
I don't regret not buying and there was
a request to do makeup that I regret not
buying so I thought it would be a lot of
fun to do I had a couple items pop in my
head right away but this was actually a
lot harder than I thought it was going
to be to come up with a list because of
course I'm going to try to talk about
like discontinued makeup on a stock
makeup makeup that we know it's not
coming back or probably is not coming
back or is out of stock right now for
the near future and it was kind of
harder than I thought it was going to be
because there's a lot of makeup out
there that I regret not buying right now
but I still have the opportunity to buy
it still for sale and that sort of thing
so this one was actually a little bit
trickier than I originally thought it
was going to be but I hope that you guys
still like it and like when I came up
with it is going to be all eyeshadow
palettes that I'm talking about as I was
going through this list I was like there
really is all eyeshadow palettes on here
that I regretted not buying so I just
thought that was kind of funny but I had
a few other items that I could put in it
but once I realized majority where I
shall apologize just do all eyeshadow
palette suppose you'd want to see like
around two of makeup that I regret not
buying like I have highlights and
lipsticks and things like that on my
list let me know in the comments down
below because I can definitely do
another one source this videos like all
good fun you know I I don't think I've
shed any tears over not being able to
binder this I haven't lost sleep it
hasn't impacted my life you know so
seriously that I wasn't able to buy this
so please don't take this video do this
but it's just supposed to be a fun one
and we get to chat about makeup which is
my favorite type of video to make but if
you would like to see the makeup that I
regret not buying let's go ahead and get
started so the first one that I want to
talk about is a youtuber collaboration
it
when kathleenlights teamed up with
morphe brushes and released an eyeshadow
palette i was so excited about this
palette and i would like i definitely
buying this one like a foreshore I love
Kathleen she is one of my favorite
youtubers and I really enjoy morphe I
have a lot of their eyeshadow palettes I
was like this is going to be perfect the
eyeshadow palette definitely caught my
eye with the Browns and some neutrals in
there but there was a cool pop of green
there was a black in there there was
like kind of like this mustardy looking
color which I really enjoy I was just
like yeah I'm gonna like I need this and
it sold out in like 30 minutes it went
really really fast I don't even think I
made it to my computer on time before it
had sold out and I was like what it was
crazy it just it went so fast you know
that they brought it back but it sold
out again and I'm not sure I remember
even thinking to myself like oh no once
I saw the date that it was coming back I
was like I know that I'm not going to be
able to be on my computer on the phone
at that time maybe it won't sell out as
fast and it's still sold out super quick
so I wasn't able to get it it's not for
sale right now I don't know if it's
going to come back again because they
brought it back once I'm not sure if
they'll bring it back again but I was
really bummed that I missed this one and
I know a lot of people say that they
really like it and I see some really
pretty makeup looks with it so you know
this one that was a regret for me I wish
I could have got that one so another one
that I have from morphe is more recent
releases from them I was there 25 a and
25 B palette and I really was interested
in both of these palettes like I was
like I don't even want to make a
decision between the two like I just
want them both and I was so bummed
because the date of the release I want
to say it was like the day after
Christmas remember being out of town and
they were going to go live at like noon
or something and I'm thinking to myself
I know that we are going to be driving
in the car driving back to Des Moines
and the way that we take there is no
reception for a long time you can only
get one bar on your fault like it just
does not work out so I just I knew it
was going to happen and of course it did
we were driving at the time
they released and we get home and I run
into my office I pull up my laptop and I
get on the website and they're both sold
out I was like I knew it I knew it I
knew it was in heaven I knew it was
going to happen and then they came back
in stock and I remembered getting told
like someone sent me a snapchat or
something and was like hey is
appellative back in stock so I went onto
the morphe website to look but only one
of them was back in stock so I don't
know it's like the one just sold out
quicker then the other one did but so I
see that the one is in stock I believe
it was the 25 a so I put it in my cart
and then I start going through the
morphe page and adding I was adding in
like brushes and I was like I was just
trying so hard to hit the 100 dollar
mark because free shipping just means a
lot to me I don't know why you guys it's
like a serious problem I don't know like
those memes that are like you'll spend
$60 more to get the free shipping
instead of just buying like the $10 item
that you originally wanted like it
doesn't really make sense in the end but
it's what's important to me but I'm
going through I'm adding more things
adding brushes they're makeup sponge was
available and I was so excited about
that I remember putting eyelashes in the
cart and then by the time I got there it
was so loud I'm like this has to be a
joke right it has to be a joke so that's
over with so I didn't get the 25 and 25
beep house from morphe a trifle time
those label times it's really
frustrating definitely when makeup sells
out this fat like this quickly because I
really I don't want to set an alarm to
buy makeup I don't want to I have done
it I've done it but I don't want to do
it it just makes me feel a little
weirded out
you know like I'm on makeup lover and
obviously I have a passion about it I
turned it into a youtube channel but
still sometimes it makes me
uncomfortable that I have to set an
alarm to get a makeup product and be on
my phone or be on my computer credit
card ready like have the rest of my
background just like makes me feel weird
so I definitely needed to do it for
those talents I still see really good
things about them but I didn't get them
and I'm bummed about it who knows it
might come back again but I think at
this point if you're trying to get them
to times I'm like
okay we're just not meant to be together
apparently but yeah I definitely
regretted not getting them especially
the first time around they looked so
beautiful so another eyeshadow palette
that was in collaboration with a beauty
youtuber this was a collaboration with
HC cosmetics and Michelle from Ready Set
glamour they came out with a four pan
eyeshadow palette collection and she
called it was the squad quad I believe
is what it was called and the shape was
really beautiful there was like a really
cool yellow in there the matte shades
that's really beautiful there was a
shimmer in there too and I'll be honest
like when I when I saw the squad squad
come out I was like oh yes it looks so
pretty you know like I really liked it
was I like oh my gosh these shades I
absolutely have to have because I don't
have them no except for the yellow like
the yellow really looks very
eye-catching to me but the actual
palette like didn't make me like lose my
mind or go gaga but I was really excited
to support Michelle from Ready Set
glamour like that was kind of like the
main reason why I thought I would get
the palette and I ended up not getting
it and to be like I'm gonna be really
honest with you guys I don't really
remember why I ended up not going for it
I remember thinking that it was a little
bit more expensive than what I thought
it should have been and I can't remember
the price right now but I remember
thinking like that's kind of high for 4
eyeshadows right I can recall thinking
that and I think maybe that kind of like
made me back off and I'm bummed that I
didn't do it and like now it's
definitely a regret for me even more
because where is Michelle I'm actually
like really bummed when I was thinking
about this video and what I was going to
say the palette did pop into my mind
because I was like oh yeah I remember I
really wanted to get that palette and I
kind of passed over it you know I
thought it was too much money whatever
I'm like I kind of wish that I had
gotten it because is she coming back and
I'm really like ask you this question do
you guys if anybody knows and I actually
talked about it on my snapchat one day
and this was a while ago but I was like
has anybody seen any updates from
Michelle already said glamour like I
used to love watching her video I just
thought she was very like relatable and
she liked to talk about
a lot of makeup but she had really good
tutorials at the same time like I just
was really drawn to her channel I was
really excited for her collaboration and
I kind of wish that I would have gotten
it now even though I don't know she's
even around anymore but it kind of
really bums me out I saw that she posted
something on her Instagram back in
February saying like she's okay and she
just needed a break from social media
but I want to thank her last YouTube
video was in like November or December
or sometimes like it was awhile ago like
I totally understand taking breaks and
that's definitely like needed but
usually people take like a couple weeks
maybe but it's been like several months
now and I don't like her Instagram post
when I read it it didn't make it sound
like she was coming back anytime soon so
that really bums me out so yeah I wanted
to mention that one too because it did
pop into my mind when I was thinking
about makeup that I regretted not buying
but then also because I just wonder if
she's coming back or if anybody knows
anything else and I would love to know
but you had a thought that I didn't get
the collab and and now I'm bummed too
that she appears to be conned so there's
someone a couple here from I'm Suzy
Beverly Hills that I regretted not
buying and one is the master palette by
Mary oh I didn't get this one mostly
because I had bought in a Nastasia
single shadows and just like really
didn't like them I actually talked about
it and like my top 5 best and worth
eyeshadow palettes I mentioned a
Nastasia singles and like how I didn't
like them and I said in the video it
actually deterred me from buying the
modern renaissance palette because I
didn't like the single shadows
so I was like why would I buy a whole
palette if I didn't like really love the
eyeshadows I ended up purchasing the
modern renaissance palette thankfully
and I really enjoy it but I didn't buy
the Mario palette either because I was
like I don't know I don't really like
the single shadows like I'm not going to
go out buy this palette and honestly
like I try not to buy a ton of limited
edition but it's definitely not always
the case I do buy limited edition but I
was like oh you know I don't really like
single shadows a mess limited edition
like what
I don't need it I think it was a little
bit more expensive like I think they
like not to the price up like two or
three dollars because of the
collaboration and so I was like Nick I
don't need it and I get frustrated
because I still see people using this
palette and social people talking about
it I've been watching more of like best
and worst I shadow palette videos too
since I did my video and I'm seeing like
now it's coming up and my like
recommended on YouTube like Oh watch
those two and so many people are
mentioning this palette I'm like dang it
I didn't get it ah but that's okay I was
able to get the modern renaissance
apologist course because that one was
not limited edition or discontinued or
whatnot it came back in Psych and I was
finally able to get it but I'm still
kind of salty that I didn't get that
valid another palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills and I'm bummed I didn't
get is the world traveler Pele and this
is fine
basically solely because when I first
like really started watching YouTube
before I even made my channel and I was
just like starting to like religiously
watch Beauty YouTube videos so many
people would talk about this world
traveler pilot and they would use it I
thought in favorite videos I did not
know who I'm Stasi Beverly Hills was at
the time I started my youtube channel I
am very very very new to makeup I did
not know much before I started watching
YouTube I really I feel like I didn't
really know like everything before I
started watching YouTube I didn't know
much before I started my channel I just
thought like hey why not let's go with
it so I wasn't familiar with the brand I
didn't know who she was or like
understand what a powerhouse she was in
the makeup world but I would just see
this palette constantly mentioned
complement and I'm like I need that I
think I need that in my life I didn't
buy it because I wasn't find a lot of
like high-end makeup products and
especially eyeshadow palettes at that
time I think I had like maybe a wet and
wild eyes shadow trio and then maybe
like some Maybelline shadows or
something and I was like perfect I'm
good to go I didn't know how to apply
eyeshadow I didn't have blending brushes
I was like why mine is a while and spent
all this money on this big well I've had
a palette with shades in there that I
don't know what to do with it I don't
know how to apply them so I ended up not
buying it and that's mostly for the
reason was I just I was too new to
makeup at the time I didn't understand
what I would do with this eyeshadow
and I didn't get it but I still think we
do hear people talk about this palette
even still not as much as when I first
started watching the videos which were
you know this was probably like three
years ago maybe when I started watching
the YouTube video so I don't hear people
talk about it as much anymore but it's
always something that's kind of like at
the back of my mind like months when you
almost bought the world traveler palette
just because you heard a lot of people
talk about it like that would have been
one of like the original YouTube made me
buy it before I even knew how to do
makeup I was going to buy the world
traveler pastels but yeah that's
definitely another one I'd love to know
if any of you guys have this palette I
feel like I still hear a lot of people
say really good things about it so I'd
love to know if you have it can I have a
- I found palettes here from Joseph
colors one is their ice cream palette
and I was so frustrated with myself that
I did not get the eyeshadow palette
always said like oh you know I'm not an
eyeshadow palette junkie ball block I
truly still like trying to do stand by
that because there's so many times where
I didn't buy an eyeshadow palette
because I was like I don't need it I
can't justify this sometimes I can't
justify the price you know sometimes I
can't justify I have something like that
in my collection so I can't get this one
and I feel like if you're an eyeshadow
palette junkie you're like that's not a
big deal I still need it because I'm a
lipstick addict and a lipstick junkie it
does not matter that I have 54 nude
liquid lipsticks if another one comes up
and I see it I'm like I have to have
that one because it's different totally
different like I'm that way with
lipsticks so when I'm saying that I
shall apologize that's kind of what I
mean because I've talked myself out of a
lot of eyeshadow palettes that I really
did like sometimes it's based on price
or you know I was on a no buy or you
know things like that but a lot of times
it's made of seeing like you don't need
it you don't need a girlfriend don't do
it and the ice cream palette was really
one of those because it was just like
and it sounds weird but it was just such
a more unique palette and I was like am
I really going to be able to use that a
lot am I going to be able to get a lot
of use out of it because there's like
these crazy greens and this like purple
and at the same time they're so Browns
and like shimmers in there but unlike
most attracted to those weird colors for
whatever
I don't know I'm most attracted to those
colors and I'm like I don't know would I
be able to get enough use out of this
thing it was more expensive I can't
remember the price again but I remember
it being more expensive I never bought
in from dohsa colors I was like I just
don't know if I can do it and I was so
bummed and I saw so many people doing
the tutorial with it and they like make
such bob love and I was so jealous then
I didn't get it but I didn't I still
kind of regret this one like I still I
still really wish that I had this one
especially because I'm also an ice-cream
addict so just what it made sense but I
didn't do it I didn't I didn't get this
one another eyeshadow palette from
Joseph colors that I totally regret not
buying is there hidden treasures a
shadow palette this palette looked so
cool to me I remember seeing the YouTube
videos and people using it and talking
about it like the pr samples that were
sent out people getting it I was like oh
my gosh it looks so cool like it looked
like a treasure map and it has all of
these really cool like unique type of
eyeshadow shades in there I was like I
totally have to get this one now I did
not buy this one because this was before
I understood that makeup would sell out
when I first started watching YouTube
videos and getting into them I did not
understand that concept that I couldn't
just see something I really liked and be
like I'm going to get that one day that
does not work in the makeup world
especially for really hot releases you
can't even wait a day and get them like
in my mind I was like maybe I'll get
that next month after I get my shake
from Amazon for selling books no no you
will not get that next month because
it's going to sell out in one day
sometimes it's going to sell out in what
hours like you're not going to get that
next month I did not understand that
that was a thing when I first heard of
washing the YouTube videos and I quickly
I quickly learned that that happened it
was what the hidden treasure palette
that I realized that they would just go
away and they would not come back and I
was very devastated about it so that was
really the biggest reason why I didn't
buy it because I just thought yeah I'll
buy it when when I'm ready to buy it and
it was gone
and I did not get a buyer so did anyone
else not
when you first started in a makeup game
because like I'm coming from the book
world if you don't know I'm an author
I'm coming from the book world into the
beauty world and that was never even a
thought of mine that like makeup will
just sell out and it won't come back and
like whatever because like my book will
not mat be for sale I want you to buy my
book I want you to read my book I want
you to talk about my book but all this
makeup just disappears and goes away I'm
like how does that make sense and
honestly it's still something that like
really surprises me especially when I
see this was usually like youtuber
collaborations but even sometimes just
makeup companies in general they'll be
like these are going to sell out why the
hell is that a good thing like I don't
understand that that's what people are
pushing for like hope we sell out why
why don't you want people to have your
products I don't get it into like it
honestly confuses me but now that now I
know but I remember I can vividly recall
the hidden treasures palette being one
of them so I thought to myself oh this
gets us later and then it was gone so
the last talk that I want to talk about
is from violet sauce it is their Holy
Grail I shadow pelic and I'm bummed
about this one I've actually I feel like
I was talking about by the boss more and
more I believe I mentioned them in the 7
brands that I want to try in 2017 video
they are just definitely a brand that
it's on my radar right now and I'm
really interested in buying something
from them especially eyeshadow palette
because I do hear really good things
about them I saw the Holy Grail being
used so much and I would see it
constantly being referred to in YouTube
videos and I'm really bummed that I
missed it I'm not sure if they're going
to bring it back because I think you
brought it back at some point so maybe
they'll bring it back in the future who
knows makeup companies can do what they
want to do a lot of times brands say
something is like once it's out of stock
it's gone and then a week later they're
like just kidding it's back so we for
like truly no but I feel like it's the
Holy Grail we're to come back in stock I
really would want to purchase this one
because it always has been more
eye-catching to me I know that they we
just released the writer diet palette
which I think is out of stock at this
time as well but that's how it was like
ginormous and I think it was more like
$75 I mentioned in a will a video and
like all of you talked me out of that
palette there was so many comments and I
like you do not need this girl for
don't do it I was like guys like Grails
palette is $45 so that's definitely a
lot better and it's just you know a
smaller more manageable tips palette so
I think if this one were to come back in
stock like I would totally hop on it I
was always a regretting my - I just wish
that I kind of like tried by the boss
sooner and that I was able to have the
Holy Grail in my collection but in the
beginning the video i don't think i've
you know shed any tears over not getting
these eyeshadow palettes i don't think
that I've lost any sleep over them down
was another one that I thought oh man do
regret not buying that huh and that one
is going to be the last one I'm talking
about for my makeup that I regret not
buying video alright guys so that is
going to be everything for my makeup
