today's video is going to be all of Oz
and makeup I talked myself out of buying
this video has been on my list to do for
months and months and months and I
finally have some products here that I
have planned on purchasing and that I
talked myself out of time so pen shows
video because I know it has been super
requested before we get started I want
to say thank you so much for clicking on
this video and I am posting right now
every single day so if you enjoy getting
a daily content I hope that you will
consider hitting the subscribe button
I have 20k giveaways that are closing
very soon on both YouTube and Instagram
those are linked down below and then I
have a huge mix lipstick giveaway going
on across four of my social media
channels and all of that will be linked
down below so you'll want to make sure
that you get entered but when we go
ahead and get started and talk about
some makeup that I talked myself out of
I'm if you jump into it I have a
foundation from the balm cosmetics as
their even-steven foundation I feel like
this video could be so long to film
because I was going off of my will i buy
it videos I post my related videos every
single Wednesday I'll have my playlist
linked down below and I'm talking about
makeup and if I'm going to buy it if I'm
not going to buy it but so when I was
trying to film this video I was going
through my will I buy it but it was like
everything that I said I was going to
buy I was buying but apparently I do a
terrible job it was talking myself out
of buying makeup but I finally have some
products here and the first one it was
the even Stephen at foundation from the
balm I mentioned in my will advice video
that I thought I would try it out I
don't have a lot from the balm I wanted
to buy more from the balm and kind of on
a foundation kick at those times I
thought why not be able to try out a new
foundation I kind of liked the way that
it sounded kind of like this whipped
lightweight kind of really creamy
formula but still with a decent coverage
and I thought sure right now I'm going
to go ahead and give it a go and you all
talk to me out of it there are so many
comments in that video of doing out by
that foundation the review is weren't
great you weren't getting a lot of
product and when I did seems like the
actual
photos like on Instagram of people that
had bought the foundation I mean it
really did look like the smallest little
bottle effort it was quite tiny and I
are people saying that you know it
wasn't a lot of product that you're
getting so even though $22 who does a
good price compared to other foundations
it wasn't so good and I do read all of
my comments
respond to you know the majority of the
comments unless you're saying something
really rude to me but I do read and
respond to all those comments and when I
was reading them I was like oh my gosh
people really do not think I should give
this foundation and so I have you guys
to thank because you sure talk to me out
of getting that foundation so I did not
purchase the even-steven foundation from
the balm cosmetics and I'm okay with
that
I'm okay with that decision so next I
actually have a brand to talk about so I
mentioned in one of my villa diets of
the brand pretty vulgar they were a new
brand to Sephora a lot of people got
really hyped over them a lot of people
bought like a ton from their collection
because they released a huge collection
I want to say it was maybe somewhere
around like 80 pieces from eyeshadow
palettes and eyeliners and brow pencils
and mascaras and I mean they just had so
much stuff that they were coming out
with and a ton of people were buying a
lot from the collection and reviewing it
on their YouTube channels and I was
pretty excited about it I really liked
the packaging it was kind of like the
vintage feel I thought it was really fun
I was really interested in like the idea
behind the name pretty vulgar I thought
that was super interesting pretty
excited for the brand I was planning on
buying something and I watched more and
more review videos and of course I don't
ever just watch one review video and
make a decision and nobody really should
you know you should watch all the people
that you love and trust and kind of see
what everybody is saying and then form
your own opinion and that's really what
I did I'm pretty vulgar because as you
know a lot of different reviews come in
from them some people absolutely love
the brand
some people dislike almost everything
that they picked out from the brain but
one of the consensus that I feel like I
took away from pretty vulgar watching
review videos is that people have said
it's really really pricey makeup for
like decent quality I didn't see a lot
of people being like oh my gosh I'm
still blown away by this brand I'm so
blown away by this eyeshadow palette I'm
so blown away by this like I didn't feel
like I was really getting that vibe from
people or you know that's what people
are just straight up saying and I
thought you know what I like the idea of
trying different brands and I'm trying
to brand you out because I definitely
know that I'm in like my Sephora Ulta
box I know that and it's something that
I'm trying to improve on and you know
step outside of my comfort zone and try
out different brands but at the same
time I am very conscious of my wallet
I'm also
a conscience of what I'm putting into my
makeup collection because it is bigger
and I don't want to fill it with subpar
items or items that I don't feel
particularly drawn to by and honestly
watching the lot of those review videos
they kind of talked me out of it I
thought it just seems pretty decent and
I don't want to spend the type of money
on the pretty vulgar products and just
get something that's decent I would put
my money towards you know just a
different brand in general whether it be
an indie brand or brand that is as you
know also for our Ulta but a brand that
I feel like would be better quality and
better suited towards me so again it was
watching a lot of those review videos it
just kind of talked me out of it and
honestly I'm okay with data a lot of
hype about pretty vulgar when it did
first hit before I saw a lot of review
videos and I was seeing a lot of chatter
about it and now I really am not seeing
a lot and that says a lot to me as well
a lot of times when you don't see a
product a lot on YouTube it typically
means a lot of people don't like it so
you know what I'm okay with it I would
like to know though as you guys did buy
anything from pretty vulgar and what
some of your favorites or your flops for
as well I would like to know but I
passed over pretty vulgar and not saying
that I'm never going to not purchase it
from them because I definitely put in
the future but after filming that will I
buy a video I was like yeah I'm going to
purchase you know right when they come
into Sephora and I just didn't do it in
out book right now I don't have any
plans on buying anything from them but
if you guys have any feedback on pretty
well there I would love to know an
eyeshadow palette that I talked myself
out of it was from Tarte cosmetics of
cert artists Pro palette this was a I
believe it's $54 for 20 different
eyeshadows it's a sigle palette has a
big old mirror in it 20 different shades
mattes and shimmers and I know there's
like some google chrome's in there as
well and this is a palette that even
still I feel like I see a lot about it I
feel a lot of people using it a lot of
people reaching for it a lot of people
recommending it and when it first
launched and it first came out I was
excited about it I really liked are that
one of my favorite brands
I'd buy from them quite a bit and I use
a lot of tartar on my face right now my
blush and highlight is tart so I thought
you know yeah I'm going to go ahead and
get this talent I actually did purchase
it but I put it in a giveaway I can't
remember now which giveaway it was but I
remember buying it and then I put it
into the giveaway and I thought buy it
buy yourself a palette you know you're
going to put in the giveaway people are
so hyped about it buy it free
self and I just thought no I don't feel
a pole when it actually came down to
purchase the pallet like when I was
thinking about it and talking about yes
yes totally I'm going to buy it the
shades look so pretty it looks like a
versatile pallet yet in everyday pellet
has a big mirror it start I liked art
buy it but then when it actually came
down to bind the pallet I just could not
do it
and even still this is not a limited I
still think it's a limited edition
pallet let me say that I don't think
it's a limited edition pallet it's still
available right now on the turf what
said I can still buy it I think you can
get it out before for sure possibly even
also I'll have any links down below for
anything that I'm talking about so it's
still there it's still around I can
still buy it if I want to charges out of
twenty five percent off sale I think the
pellet was included in that but for some
reason I just it's just not calling to
me anymore if I could like explain
better what what it is that's holding me
back but it just doesn't drama in it
just didn't excite me like other
eyeshadow palettes excite me and even
though the Tarte Pro palette is still
around and I still hear really good
things about it like I really haven't
heard a lot of negative reviews on
guitar pro palette I see a lot of people
using it it just does not call out to me
so I would rather not spend over $50 on
an eyeshadow pellet that doesn't scream
my name spend that money on an eyeshadow
palette or a lipstick or just something
else from a makeup collection
I would rather spend my money on
something that does really excite me and
something that like I feel I can't live
without and the Tarte propel it just
doesn't do it for me so I talk to myself
I was buying that one and I'm still okay
with it except for makeup that I've
talked myself out of where the steal of
magnificent metals glitter eyeshadows
you guys know what I'm talking about
because I definitely hear a lot about
them even still and I either hear really
good things or really bad things like
there's not a lot of like in between 4d
Stila glitters but I decided not to get
them and it was quite a process to get
here we're talking about these in a
wilayat video and I was like yeah you
know I should probably get so social so
some seems bad and then I think the
support of the icy sale came around and
I was like you should get them at a
discount and I didn't because they're
$24 for one - so basically 24 hour
dollars for one glitter that's a lot of
money you know for one eyeshadow one
glitter
let's compress it's me so I was like you
should give him the vib sale and I
didn't do it and then I talked about him
again I was like I think I'm going to
get them you guys like I think it's
going to happen and I still didn't do it
I just completely talked myself out of
them and by now at this point I'm like
girlfriend you're not getting them you
just don't do it there were several
different reasons why I was holding
myself back from buying them of course
$24 for a glare
that's price even I don't wear glitter
very often I wear a lot of matte
eyeshadows sometimes I don't even wear
shimmer shadows on my eyes I am today
but some days you just see me in
straight-up matte shadows I'm not a
glittery type of person I don't reach
for glitter on a daily basis I'm reach
for glitter on a weekly basis I mean I
would be hard-pressed to say if I reach
for a glitter on a monthly basis I just
don't do it I also have a lot of trouble
finding a glitter that works okay with
my eyes I have like ie rotational ITER's
a lot of glitters don't work for me
so that kind of worried me right off the
bat like I don't know if I would
actually get along with this product but
you know just those all of those
different factors but especially being I
just don't think I'm going to get a lot
of use out of these that's the biggest
thing to me even more than the price but
of course the price factors into that
because if you're not going to use
something that's more expensive on a
decent basis but last thing your money
high I would rather spend it on
eyeshadow palette that I'm going to keep
reaching for so I talk to myself all the
Stila glitters and even though I almost
talked myself into them like three
different times I'm saying no I'm saying
no to the Stila glitters so another
brand that I essentially talked myself
out of buying is Beauty bakery did
mention Beauty bakery in a video I think
maybe it was a will I buy it
and I mentioned that I wanted to pick up
a couple items from them they have some
setting powders coming out around that
time that I was super interested in and
then I had heard some things about wow
they're lipstick so I just wanted to try
a few different items and you know
purchase from them and see what I
thought of them they are an indie brand
and I talked myself out of it because I
started to see a lot of reviews that
people just weren't like super impressed
in particular I saw a Stephanie from Bad
beauty and I know that she picked up the
setting powders and she just really
didn't have a lot of good things to say
about them
another snapchat hall I don't think it
was loo Stephanie but I can't remember
who it was off the top of my head but
they got a bunch of the lipsticks and
they really didn't have anything good to
say about them so again it was very
similar to pretty Welker that I was like
you know there's a lot of other brands
that I want to be trying out and I want
to feel a little bit more confident
about trying out the prams and I was
feeling about Beauty bakery so that's
why I decided not to purchase from them
around the time that I was speaking
about them in the wilayat video again
saying this was pretty vulgar I'm not
saying that I'm never going to buy
anything from Beauty bakery because
definitely they could come out with
something that really catches my
attention and that I really have to have
but so far I just haven't heard enough
positive feedback and positive reviews
that I want to spend my money and try it
out myself as always I'd like to know
what you guys think about Beauty bakery
if you guys have bought anything from
them or if you've seen really positive
reviews about you know any of the
certain products from there and you
still think that I should do it I would
love to know I do understand that I have
a YouTube channel and you know part of
like my job or whatever you want to call
it is to try out a different makeup is
to review it and to give my feedback on
it at the same time I'm just a regular
girl who spends a lot of money on makeup
anyways I have to spend a lot of money
on camera and equipment and editing
software and everybody wants me to paint
my freaking room so I'm trying to save
up money so I can take a week off to
move everything out of my room and prime
it and paint it and wait to move
everything back in which is going to be
a huge job so I can't just be buying
everything at this point and when I'm
going to be spending my money on makeup
I want to be at least somewhat confident
in my purchases slowly down the road I
can you know be a little bit more
adventurous and I can be like those
people who can buy 10 items blindly from
pre-roll girl or Beauty bakery just to
be able to review on their channel but
to be honest it's just not where I am at
right now but you know it's a goal of
mine but for that reason you know I'm
going to pass over Beauty bakery right
now but leave me any of your thoughts on
the branded envelope I just mentioned
this one in my most recent will I
invited video yesterday's video I think
is what it was but it was the Anastasia
Beverly Hills blush trio Hana Sophia
came out with some blush trios and I was
really excited
about them I put them in a will about
video I said Oh super stoked about them
I'm getting more into palates I like
that we were going to get three
different blushes I believe it was $30
for the blush palette I was into it I
said I was going to buy it and then I
just I kept not doing it
I just kept not like they were in my
card at Ulta I had five times the points
in Anasazi and I still didn't buy it and
I'm like okay girlfriend like get it
together
why you not buying this you know you
want it I've seen great reviews on it
what are you doing what are you waiting
for
I just kept not doing it and then I
liked how I mentioned in my will advice
video makeup forever is coming out with
these new palettes and you can basically
personalize your own palette so if you
want to buy a three pan palette you can
pick three different shades from blush
to contour shades to highlight shades
and you can put your own like
personalized shades into these palettes
and I thought that was a great idea $45
for that palette so I thought well why
would I not go with the $30 Anastacio
but when I was looking at the Anastacio
palette I was like I like the shape an
outside shade I like these two shades
but not that one shade I wish one shade
from each of these palettes was in this
little palette and basically you can do
that with makeup forever so not only was
I already like late to the game hitting
the checkout button on Amazon zo blushes
then let's make up for over came out and
I thought you know what I just think
it's going to be a better idea if I buy
the makeup forever because that way I
know that I'm getting free shades that
like I feel like I would really use on a
daily basis pretty sure I'm going to go
ahead and make the make up for ever
purchase wants to become available in
Sephora and I'm going to skip over the
anasazi a blush trails not saying that
I'm never going to buy the anasazi a
blush trio because I might have a moment
of weakness again but if I haven't
bought them and they've been on my mind
and like in my office cart for so long
and I just haven't been able to do it
and makes me think that I'm not going to
do it so I talked myself out of the
anesthesia blush trios underneath final
item as I talked myself out of what was
the Sephora Pro palette sees our new
pals to Sephora recently mentioned in a
wilayat video they came out with three
different palettes I think was the warm
the cool and the editorial palette I
want to say I was thinking about getting
the warm palette I put in a will I buy a
video I struggled really hard but I felt
that I think that I'm going to get this
pal
and has the warm tones that I really
love and there a lot of people were
saying it could be a comparison to the
Natasha did not a sunset palette which I
really do want to get sold out right now
so I thought you know maybe I should
just do it
$68 which was definitely expensive to me
and I was a little bit nervous to spend
$68 because I'm not familiar with
Sephora eyeshadows I don't have a ton of
from the Sephora brand in general so I
was nervous to spend $68 on an eyeshadow
palette a lot of the comments in that
video and a lot of the comments were
saying that I shouldn't buy it there was
a lot of you know Sephora palettes can
be very hit or miss Sephora palettes can
be not great quality $68 is too much for
a Sephora palette you should just save
your money and wait for the Natasha Din
order to come back in stock and I really
read a lot of those comments and I
thought okay like I feel like you guys
did a good job of talking me out of that
then the reviews started coming in and
the reviews do sound good I'm seeing a
lot of good reviews for these palettes
I'm seeing fantastic makeup tutorials
I'm hearing a lot of good feedback and I
honestly thought when I saw those
reviews come in that my opinion would
definitely sway and I would change I
would want to go ahead and purchase them
again but I didn't do it and I don't
feel the pull right now it was kind of
one of those things where it almost
would have been like a impulse buy you
know if I thought maybe these things
were going to sell out right away it was
going to be an impulse buy but after I
waited and gave it some time
I decided you know I just don't need it
I don't think I need it I don't think
it's worth of $68 I think I was just
going to be buying into the hype which I
do I buy into the hype all the time I'm
not that's not a bad thing as we all do
it but I think I was definitely going to
buy into the hype and after I let the
hype dies down I was like you know what
I really don't need it I don't feel bad
about not having it I don't feel like
I'm missing out on anything and then
even with the great reviews I'm still
kind of like you know what I just don't
think that I need it and I'm okay
passing over it again I'm not saying
that I'm never going to purchase the
Sephora collection eyeshadow palette I'm
not even saying that I'm not going to
purchase the warm palette sometime down
the road or any of these other pro
palettes like maybe they will have an
amazing deal on them and I won't be able
to pass it up so right now I have no
intention of buying the Sephora Pro
palettes and I think I'm going to be
okay alright guys that is everything for
this video of makeup
I talked myself out of buying I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this video

for months and months and months as oh
