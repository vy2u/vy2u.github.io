today's video is going to be all about
makeup products that I talked myself out
of buying I've had a couple of requests
to do this out from my will I buy a
video it's kind of like a follow up to
some of the will i buy it videos where I
am just chatting about the items that I
mentioned in those videos almost like
yeah I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get it or
interested in getting it but then I
ended up talking myself out of so I will
have my bullabbai at playlist linked
down below I plus those videos every
single Wednesday I bought new makeup
releases and training but if I'm going
to pick them up or not and so I wanted
to share some of the products that I
decided not to pick up so if you want to
see some of the makeup products I talked
to myself out of buying when we go ahead
and get started one of the items I
mentioned in a recent well I bite video
and I said I was fairly sure I was gonna
go ahead and give this one a try was it
from a Smashbox and it was there a stick
foundation on one end you had a
foundation shade and on the other end
you had a contour color and I'm really
interested in items like that I've been
on a foundation kick lately I love that
there was the contour on the other end I
was like yes I'm pretty sure probably
gonna get this one and then I just
really never did there was a lot of
other foundations that caught my
attention more and then I also wanted to
be going through some of my foundation
so I was really proud of myself that
I've gone through a couple here lately
and that made me pretty happy but I
think that one was mostly just a I was
purchasing some other ones like during
the vib sale I bought a Dior Foundation
which is more expensive it kind of got
to the point where I was like okay
realistically a look at your foundation
collection and do you need to purchase
even more foundations so I decided to go
ahead and pass over it even though it
still kind of catches my attention I'm
still interested in the idea but also
this is one that I really heard nobody
talking about and sometimes that's
something that kind of makes me a little
bit hesitant to purchase makeup as well
because I don't know if people are not
talking about it because they tried it
and didn't love it and just didn't want
to say it or because you know people
simply aren't buying it either so there
wasn't a ton of reviews out there so I
decided to go ahead and pass over that
Smashbox foundation and I would love to
know if anybody picked it up and your
thoughts on them but I talked to myself
out of that foundation also the Too
Faced their recent peach palette I
always say this one wrong and it's
because they have so many freakin peach
palettes I always think I'm gonna say
the wrong one
it was there the peachy matte one I
think is what it was called this one I
was so on the fence about and I
mentioned it and will I buy a video and
it was the first time I believed that I
was talking about Too Faced in a while I
buy a video for a very long time because
I went on a know buy from Too Faced and
I wasn't gonna be purchasing anything
from the brand so it just seemed you
know a little silly to be including them
in the will i buy it videos when i
wasn't supporting the brand and i had
already said that in past videos but
then this came along and I was like I'm
gonna put it in my will I buy a video
because I want to let people know that
is something that has caught my
attention a lot of different reasons I
wasn't purchasing from Too Faced but one
of them was that they weren't putting
out anything that I was interested
enough in and they are higher price
brand so that was one of the reasons but
definitely when this palette came out it
did catch my attention I really loved
the shades in there I like the all matte
palette I'm really into math for sure so
I was interested in it and I ended up
talking myself out of it and then this
is one that I almost talked myself back
into buying especially around the VIP
sales and I was like no stay strong you
can do it I really enjoy my Too Faced
sweet peach palette and because I have
so many eyeshadow palettes like I can
hardly give some of my favorite palettes
enough love and that is one that I kind
of have to try to remember like I even
moved it from where it was in my
eyeshadow collection like I moved it up
a little bit so when I'm looking over my
eyeshadow palettes it's more front and
center so I can remember to grab it but
it seemed like there was gonna be a lot
of similar shades from that palette in
the peachy matte palette and I just
decided to keep sticking on with my no
buy from Too Faced at the moment but
that is one that almost almost got me to
do it here really positive reviews about
the palette but just not not enough to
convince me to buy it I guess another
one is from Sephora it was one of their
Sephora favorite sets I love the Sephora
favorite sets i buy it quite a few of
them and i typically always buy the nude
lip one love that one and they actually
came out with like a really large lip
collection it was around holiday time I
want to say her before the holiday time
and there was a bunch of different lip
products in there from full sizes to the
smaller sizes but it was $68 for all of
them at
in a willing buyer video and I was like
yes you know I think I want to buy this
one
mostly because I buy those sets a lot
and I feel like they're a really good
value and you're getting out to try out
different products or maybe there's a
favorite and there type of thing but I
kept looking at it I kept going back to
it and I was like $68 is a lot and I
know that like I will not be able to get
to all these different lipsticks there
were so many and there it was such a big
set but I was like okay you can put some
in a giveaway you can pass them along to
like friends around the holiday time and
that sort of thing and still be able to
keep some for yourself but when I kind
of looked at it even more closely like
cuz I had it in my cart and everything
don't get me wrong I had it in my cart
but no I was really like getting down to
crunch time like I'm going to buy this
for $68 I was like you know what I don't
think I need to do it I think there's a
lipstick that I that is in the set that
I'm that interested in I can just go
ahead and purchase that regular lipstick
it just seemed like it was going to be
too much like I still thought it was a
great price and I still thought there
could have been some cool gifts in there
as well but in the end I just thought it
was going to be too much I much prefer
the smaller sets that have like five to
six different products in there for like
the $28 I would rather do that instead
of this big old collection and then I
feel like how many of these am I
actually going to be able to get to so I
did I talked myself out of that one I
was actually kind of proud about that
one because I'm a lipstick out I got a
lipstick lover that one was hard to pass
up but I did and I shadow palette that I
talked myself out of buying was the
lorac mega pro 4 palette I mentioned
this one in a will I buy it I feel like
I'm saying that about all of these which
of course but I put it in the will I buy
up video and I said I had never tried a
lorac mega Pro palette
there's obviously four pallets I had
never tried one of those and I hear
really good things about most of them
and you know it's one of those like kind
of old-school YouTube cult classic
products that you know everyone has been
using and I've seen a ton of people used
in tutorials and all of that but I've
just never tried him and so when the
floor came out I was like ah should this
be the first one that I try I'm not sure
and I think it was like $54 so it was
pretty expensive for a palette and I
will say that I do like lorac eyeshadows
I've tried a couple of the lorac
eyeshadow palettes and I like their
shadows but they're not necess
Sara Lee my favorite and they don't
necessarily get me like super hyped so I
was like I don't know should I purchased
this big ol you know mega Pro I should
have palette for the $54 or does that
just seem silly and I ended up passing
over it and it was like very quickly it
went on sale for like $44 maybe and then
it kept like I kept seeing it getting
discounted but at the same time a lot of
the reviews we're coming in saying like
it's not the greatest it's not the best
of the mega proline and all of that so
once those reviews started coming in and
once I saw like how it kept being
discounted and kept being discounted I
was like you know what I'm just gonna
pass over even for the discounted price
like like I was saying I have enough
eyes shadow pellets like I know I didn't
need that one but I almost got that one
but I was kind of glad that I that I
didn't do it because if I would have
purchased it for 54 and that would have
been like continually going on sale oh
it would have been so mad I know I don't
that I talked myself out of I have to
hear from Anasazi Beverly Hills actually
and one is I just wrote down AVH blushes
and I really I feel like I mentioned her
blush trios and then also the blush kits
I feel like I've mentioned both of those
and said that I was attracted to both
and I've talked to myself out of both
her trios I believe for $30 and now I
can't recall off the top of my head with
the blush kits were maybe closer to 40
because they looked really similar to a
glow kit and you got four different
shades I was interested in these and I
felt like I heard really good things
about the blush trios but they very
quickly started to get discounted as
well and then I'll send these blush kits
came in and I was like what are we doing
like sometimes I just wish brands but
just I don't know I wish they would be
more forthcoming because sometimes
things like that happened and I'm like
what so the trio's are no more like
you're discontinuing the trails and
you're having the blush kits or the
blush gets limited like what's happening
here but that was a little bit confusing
to me I was like do I go with the trio
or do I do the kid like I'm not sure
what to do and I ended up just not
purchasing a few so I don't know I
talked to myself out of those but I just
felt like the timing of everything was
like very strange I felt like there for
a moment there there was like I'm
Nastasia was coming out with just a lot
like boom boom boom boom and some of the
releases were like overlapping each
other and I was like what's happening
here and that
kind of leads me into the next one that
I was going to talk about a Nastasia was
the sugar Glo kit because that glow kit
came out on the heels of another bloke
it I'm pretty sure right
because when the sugar glow kit came out
people are like whoa wait what that like
there's there's a lot going on I feel
like when brands do that and there we at
least so much it's just kind of like
overwhelming it like pulls me back in
you know what I'm saying like does
anyone else do that because a lot of
times it's like you know color pop is a
brand that does that a lot or even like
tart like when they release so much and
they throw so much at us it just makes
me like no I don't want to I don't I
don't want to purchase anything like I
just wanna be like slow down and let us
enjoy the makeup and you know you know
what I'm saying so that's kind of what I
was thinking about the sugar Glo kit so
I remember I was in between what was I
in between the the Anastacio glow kid
and I think it was the Becca app race
key glow face palette I feel like those
two came out around the same time and I
was kind of debating back and forth
between them and ended up going with the
Becca I know that I really love the back
of highlights and also had a bronzer in
there and a blush and the Anastacio glow
kids while I liked them I also haven't
had the best of luck with that my
typically get my glow kids to me
shattered which is no fun so I was kind
of between those last two I went with
the Becca so that is why I talked myself
out of getting the one from estas Nia
last one I have here don't talk to
myself a lot of my Cubs do I do but the
last one I have here is a firm coloured
raine and they were their mini eyeshadow
palettes such as this one and very cute
so you might be saying well you did not
talk yourself out of this I had a really
sweet at subscribers send this to me to
my peel box which I was really excited
about but I did end up talking myself
out of buying these palettes and it was
kind of funny because I feel like I
mentioned it in a video later on but I
talked myself out of them and then they
went on sale and so they were only like
was it $27 that they were on sale for
and they're originally like in the $30
range and I was like I don't know if 27
is still too much because you're only
getting a six different shade so I'm
like is that still too much for an
eyeshadow palette especially because I'd
never tried coloured raine I didn't know
what their eyeshadows would be like
they're shipping
summer service etc so I was like I don't
know if I should do it I talked myself
out of it and then I had like regrets
over it I was like oh man I should have
purchased it and then I had missed the
holiday sale price and they had gone
back up and price I'm like well now I
really can't justify it so I ended up
talking myself out of them for those
reasons I just wasn't sure I would love
it I wasn't sure to be worth the price I
you know haven't tried the brand etc so
that's why I talked myself out of it but
it was really cool that a subscriber
sent this to me and it was the one that
I said that I wanted the one and very
cute because I has this beautiful purple
shade I was wearing this one in a video
recently I think it's my December makeup
monthly I think is the one that I had
this on with and I have an Instagram
video if it's up I'll have it linked
down below but if not I did fill my luck
with Instagram for this so so far I've
only tried one look with it so I can't
really say yeah I want to try the rest
of the shades I only use three shades
out of this so I want to try the rest of
the shades and see what I think about
them but so far so good I thought that
purple was really vibrant and very
pretty so I'm excited to keep trying
this so that was pretty cool to receive
but I did end up talking myself out of
these little mini coloured raine
palettes but after that that is going to
be it for the makeup that I had touched
myself out of I guess so that is
everything afford this video I hidden
the makeup that I talked to myself out
of buying oh man it was really fun to
look back on the wilayat videos and see
some of the items that I was like yes
pretty sure but nope nope I changed my
mind but as you can see from my list it
wasn't the biggest list in the world so
I mean I'm a makeup lover and I do buy a
lot of makeup so that's okay but I would
love to know what are some of the
products that you've been like yes I'm
fairly pretty sure I'm gonna buy that
and then you talked yourself out of it
and why did you talk yourself out of it
I would love to know yours in the
comments down below and as always if you
guys did enjoy this video I hope that
you will give it a thumbs up I hope that
you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I will catch you guys
in tomorrow's video right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
