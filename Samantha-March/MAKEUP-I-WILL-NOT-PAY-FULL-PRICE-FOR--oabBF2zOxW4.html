today's video is going to be all about
makeup products that I will not pay full
price for I'm really excited to chat
about some of these items that I quite
enjoy I have in my collection but I'm
gonna need to purchase them with some
sort of discount so if you'd like to see
they makeup that I will not pay the full
price for when we go ahead and get
started all right so the first item that
I want to mention is actually what gave
me the info to do this video I posted on
Friday I believe it was a flashback
Friday to buy the Cyber Monday sale from
last year and just was kind of giving a
review about the products do I still
like him with things like that and at
one point I was talking to this product
because that's normal this is the Marc
Jacobs lip gloss and sugar sugar and I
said I love you but I will not pay full
price for you and I was like hmm what
else do I have in my collection that I
love or like but will not pay full price
for and boom video idea here we go
so obviously the first one here is the
mark of sugar sugar gloss I really
enjoyed this class I actually have it in
a mini as well I came in a support give
me some nude lip set I could have easily
given away but I was like I'm gonna put
it in my clutch because I wear it that
much I would love to have a travel sized
version in my clutch for when I wear it
on nights out and things like that it
really is a nice lip gloss but it's $28
your girl can't pay $28 for a lip gloss
it just can't happen so when I purchased
this full size it was actually and the
doing the flashback video I jogged my
memory watching my haul from last year
Sephora was having some sort of special
where you got $25 off $50 so I made a
Sephora purchase there and basically I
was like well you know look I got this
for free I'm that person that I love
discount
I love coupons I know a lot of people
have problems with coupon codes I'm like
bring them on I love coupon codes Ebates
sign up for newsletters get money off
yes all of it all of it and I'm really
excited to share about some of the
products that I have to have those for
and that includes the Marc Jacobs sugar
sugar gloss item I know I've mentioned
this in the past too if this is an
eyeshadow palette this is the naked
smoky palette I have so many problems
saying make it smoky I want to say like
nikka smoke I don't know what it is but
this is the naked smoky palette now to
be fair I did not purchase this myself I
did get it
a Christmas gift which was fantastic but
I like this palette but I do not love it
and I would not be able to say I would
not be able to recommend this palette
for the $54 price tag I know I've seen
this one discounted multiple multiple
times at $27 which i think is fantastic
I've seen a discount at Apple Sephora
and Ulta for the $27 that is what I
would pay for this eyeshadow palette I
think this is a nice $27 eyeshadow
palette if the Urban Decay Naked heat if
I would have got that one on sale for
$27 I probably would have kept it to be
honest probably would have kept it but
at the $54 I did not love that baby
enough it had to go back so this $27
great I can do that but the full price
tag I cannot and then you know kind of
from what I experienced with the naked
key to I'm gonna kind of do a blanket
statement here and say probably the
Urban Decay Naked palette I will not pay
full price for I would need some sort of
like big chunk of discount to have them
because this is a nice choice of another
eyeshadow palette not 54 there's next
product here I think I purchased during
one of the VIP sales and it was because
it was so hyped up on Instagram and I
was like okay I'm just gonna go ahead
and buy it but even then I was like I
want to buy it because I want to try it
but I will not pay fifty four dollars
for the first solid rose gold elixir I
was like I just will not do that to
myself
to my great surprise and happiness I
actually really enjoyed this product and
I can tell that I'm kind of actually
getting down there I use this quite a
bit I like this you see me on Instagram
I mean I'm dropping it on my face you
know so I can fit in but I like this I
use it quite a bit under like really
full coverage or really magnifying
foundations because that's not conflict
my favorite type I use this and I really
enjoy it especially during the winter I
remember using this so much last winter
I really like this oil still not gonna
pick it to four dollars worth though
because that's really expensive for an
oil I don't care that it says it's 24
karat gold infused Beauty oil that I
mean that means nothing to me that's
thus fantastic I really do want to try
the unicorn essence one - that one is
also $54 I know they just put out many
sizes
really considering getting the mini of
the unicorn essence with only $20
because I can do a mini for a cheaper
price but full-size $54 that's not
happening
still like it though I have some
eyelashes here that I want to talk about
and if you guys don't know
I love lashes I prefer to wear lashes
Armel lashes are just like small and
tiny and mascaras just don't really help
them out too much I really like long
dramatic lashes I buy a lot of lashes I
like to try a lot of lashes but at the
same time and I can typically justify a
higher price of lashes because I wear
them so much so that's kind of how I can
justify it but there gets to be a
certain price range where I'm like I
can't pay full price even for those
lashes even though I love lashes and I
know I'm gonna wear them I know I'm
gonna get use out of them there gets to
be a certain price tag where I'm like
nope
will not pay full price for those so I
have it two different brands here to
talk about one is huda beauty and one is
blinking beauty
oh who does lashes are $20 for her
classic lashes which are like two
Samantha lash which is the first pair of
lashes that I tried from hoodie beauty
and I really enjoy also has a faux mink
lashes I just picked up some of the faux
mink in this latest a Sephora vib sale
and I picked him up in the style fara
which I actually have on my eyes today
and if they look wonky it's because I
don't like her phone my glasses learned
that my Sephora vib sale haul follow up
video and reviews are coming spoiler
alert I don't like these lashes this is
my last chance try it with Devon dark
they're no good
classic lashes I enjoy but what's
interesting as the classic lashes are
$20 that's still a very high price tag
the faux mink lashes are $23 I mean no
to the faux mink lashes I do now if else
it off but even the classic lashes for
$20 bus expensive for a pair of lashes
and you're talking to a girl who loves
lashes and who wears them almost every
single day I still can't spend $20.00
full price on a pair of lashes no no and
then I was really excited to see the
brand at blinking Beauty come in to
Sephora I especially always thought I
mean anything talking up the blinking
Beauty lashes and I really wanted to
find them I went onto the website and
these are some expensive lashes they
only have four different styles at so
for
right now it just recently came into
Sephora I think like in the spring or
summer and the four styles that they
have at Sephora are $25 but she has
lashes on her website for $30 that is
expensive for lashes so I could never
purchase from the blinking Beauty site
because not only do I love you know my
discounts and my coupon codes I love my
rewards like I mentioned earlier Ebates
is just so fantastic but not every site
especially you know smaller sites or
indie brands they're not always on eBay
store like Sephora and Ulta are so my
booty waited until they came to a
Sephora so I could at least get some
sort of discount I've heard just one
pair my first pair of when Sephora was
having double cash back on Ebates so I
got a percent back and I had gift card
and then I purchased the other pair of
bombast during the Sephora vib sale and
I got the 20% off or whatever because I
can't spend $25 on lashes love them but
no so those are two brands of false
lashes that I just cannot pay full price
for
speaking of lashes another item that I
cannot pay a full price for is high end
mascara now to be honest I typically
kind of prefer high-end mascara because
I feel like with a lot that I've tried
I've just found that they're better for
me than drugstore mascara personally and
I need as much help as I can in the lash
department if I'm not gonna wear false
lashes I really need help so I simply
tend to gravitate towards high-end
mascara the ones I'm holding here are
from Lancome this is the Hypnose drama
and then YSL this is the shoc mascara
the reason why I can't pay full price
for high-end mascaras even though I
really like them is because I don't get
enough use out of them because I wear
false lashes so it's one of those things
where I know I'm not wearing it on a
daily basis I know I'm not reaching for
it on any sort of consistent basis I
can't pay full price for that below I
like them and I gravitate towards them
over most drugstore mascaras not all
there's some good ones at the drugstore
but I still can't pay full price I'm for
example the Lancome Hypnose drama I want
to say like $28 and I think why I saw
the shock is 29 that's I mean honestly
some drugstore mascaras are getting like
over the $10 mark which is a bummer but
that's what the drugstore is doing but
that
still you know $30 on a mascara I would
rather some $30 you know and put it
towards an eyeshadow palette a
foundation heck pair of false lashes you
know what I'm saying so because I'm
someone who doesn't reach for these on a
consistent basis I don't want to pay
full price for them whenever I see a
good mascara as a like a Sephora point
per click this YSL one right here
celebrates love's raving about this and
one of her videos the shot from YSL and
then like two weeks later I saw it as a
100-point perk on this for a site and I
was like yep getting it because I also
don't typically go through a whole
mascara it's really surprising if I do
and mascara has such a short shelf life
but it's like why buy a full size when
I'm gonna run out of it so when I see a
good mini as a point perk I snatched
that up I just go ahead and now just
that bright up because I can't pay full
price for a high in mascara
another item that I just I love so much
I wish I could own every single color in
these but you can't pay full price for
the Marc Jacobs highliners these are $25
eyeliners that's expensive y'all I love
these so much I'm pretty sure I have
another color actually I think I have
four of the highlighters I'm holding
three right here I really enjoyed these
so much they are some of the best best
eyeliners out there so so pigmented they
glide on so easily if they don't rough
up your waterline they're very very
long-lasting but again they are $25 and
I am someone who like with lashes I love
eyeliner I can't leave my house without
eyeliner I always have eyeliner on my
waterline it's always been my thing I've
always always always had to have my
eyeliner on that still doesn't mean that
I can pay $25 for an eyeliner now I
actually had a subscriber sent me one of
the eyeliners and then all the other
eyeliners that I've bought have been
during VIP sales because I just can't I
just can't do it I love this I highly
recommend them I'm always recommending
them I love them but you're still not
gonna catch me painful purse right we
just have one more I didn't love to talk
about a good thing because it just got
real dark else I don't know if it's
about to snow or what but one last item
that I will not pay full price for this
is a little bit broad here but basically
it is single blushes I just pulled out
these tart ones because I actually have
one on my face today I just got one in
my Ipsy bag so I put it
so these were sitting out but I just do
not want to pay full price for single
high-end blushes tart blushes for a
full-size regular one blush is $29 no
the girl says no and I just mentioned
actually the Tarte blushes in my makeup
that I wish I would have purchased
sooner and I still hold buy that I love
the Tarte blushes I enjoyed them quite a
bit I have the big blush book 3 here I
really enjoyed these but I will not pay
full price for one Tarte blush it's not
gonna happen it's why I didn't purchase
them sooner I thought they were too
expensive the same thing with Too Faced
I looked up the price of the Too Faced
one blush a single blush from them is
$26 that's too expensive for one
freaking blood No so the Tarte blushes
that I have here I have Part A which was
my Sephora birthday gift from this past
year and then quirky which I said I just
got my Ipsy bag and then a subscriber
sent me the bag of blush book 3 so these
are like little mini guys but I mean
hello you are still getting a ton of
product in there when am I ever gonna go
through this what am I gonna even hit
pan on this I have no idea probably
never but what I think is really
interesting so for one full sized Tarte
blush that's $29 their new blush books
that they have right now at Sephora I
believe you get it's either 10 blushes
or 9 blushes and a highlight in there is
$44 so you just pay a few extra dollars
and then you get a ton of different
blushes I mean who goes through blushes
that fast because I don't think I've
ever had pan ever on any of my blushes
any of them so I'm not gonna pay full
price for one when I can either get you
know these smaller mini guys in
different sets or you can purchase a
palette like this one
the newer blush books they have a quad
of their that I would recommend over
purchasing just the one and I think
about blushes that I enjoy blush I
really do how often do you look at
someone and you're like that girls has a
nice blush you're like dang girl I like
your eyeshadow dang girl I like your
highlight dang girl I like your lipstick
whoever says dang girl I like your blush
I don't think that's ever happened to me
before I like it I like wearing it I
wear it every single day but it
not worth it to me to pay 29:26
I mean $20 for a high-end single blush
no you girls not doing it not paying
full price for a single high-end blush
and much rather purchase pellets and
feel like I'm getting a better discount
a better value for my money and all of
that but hey that's just me
maybe blush is your thing and you love
collecting little blushes that's
fantastic of course these are just my
opinions and the products that I will
not just spend full price on but then
after these single blushes are that's
gonna do it for this video and I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
and sing some of the items that I will
not to pay a full price for I had such a
fun time making this video and going
through my collection I actually even
found a few more items that I would put
in here as well but I didn't want to
make the video too long
so let me know if you guys would want to
see a part two or of course if you have
any other video ideas always leave them
for me in the description box it down
below I also want to hear some of your
products what are things that you like
that you recommend but you reach for but
you're like oh no I am not about to pay
full price for that product I would love
to know some of your guys's in the
comments down below and of course keep
in mind at the end of the day it's just
makeup we all have different preferences
we have different makeup vibes like I
said I don't wear mascara a ton and some
of you do so maybe it's worth it for you
to pay the full price you know that kind
of thing so keep it kind in the comments
and as always if you guys have enjoyed
this video I hope that you'll give it a
thumbs up I hope that you will also
consider subscribing before you go and
I'll catch you guys in tomorrow's video
