today's video is going to be all about
makeup I changed my mind about I have
seen a couple requests that come in for
this video so I thought alright I'm
gonna go ahead and do it so what I'm
talking about today is makeup that I
change my mind about either in a good
way or in a bad way I have specific
makeup products to talk about I have
brands to talk about and I have makeup
techniques makeup trends then I'm also
going in to be talking about some super
excited to share is this makeup that I
changed my mind about and thank you to
everyone who has requested this video if
you are new to my channel I want to say
thank you so much for coming by and
clicking on this video if you haven't

consider subscribing before you go
because I do post videos every single
day so if you enjoy giving daily content
on makeup and beauty I hope if you will
subscribe to get notified when I do post
my videos when I can give away for both
YouTube and Instagram is going on right
now so those links will be in the
description box down below but without
further ado when we go ahead and get
into makeup I changed my mind about
first item I want to talk about is the
lashes a lot of you guys might know that
I have a serious love for false lashes
some of the first false elections that I
ever wore were ardell lashes you can get
these from the drugstore they are super
affordable but when I started out
wearing lashes back in like high school
college days I really gravitated towards
Ardell because they were super
inexpensive
and I thought that they were very easy
to put on as I started my youtube
channel I consistently would recommend
ardell lashes for beginners because I
found them so easy to use and then one
day everything changed I still am really
not hundred percent sure what happened
but I started branching out and trying a
lot of different eyelashes and eyelash
brands and then one day I went back to
the ardell lashes and I could not get
them on for the life of me I couldn't
get them to look good I can't get them
to look natural I was like what what am
I doing wrong here and so I went back to
the other lashes that I've been having a
better time with and then again I went
back to the are gel I mean I did this
probably three or four different times
and then I finally just had to like
throw my hands in the air be like I
don't know I can't wear our no lashes
anymore and it
I don't like devastates me because this
is like I was like right or die for our
doll lashes for a very long time I mean
years and years and for some reason I
can just not vibe with them anymore so
I've definitely changed my mind on these
because they are now lashes were some of
my favorites and now I just I cannot
wear them it was like every time I would
go to my CVS no matter what was that I
was getting I was like oh I'm going to
grab a pair of ardell lashes just to
have a mess back up just to have a mess
back up and I can't remember the last
time I purchased them because I'm just
not wearing them anymore which is really
sad to me but I have definitely changed
my mind on the ardell lashes this was
the only pair that I could find in my
last drawer and it was very at the very
bottom these are my only are dull ones
so so unfortunately our del no longer
for me so another item that I changed my
mind about but for the better is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills stick foundation
when I first bought this NYX foundation
I was like me I thought this average is
pretty light to medium and while I
thought it made my face look okay I
think for me I wanted a fuller coverage
especially because I bought this more
closer to like the fall winter time I'm
pretty sure where I tend to do a fuller
coverage type of foundation and now in
the summer time I like a lighter
coverage I wear a lot of BB creams or
tinted moisturizers in the summer so I
just don't like a lot of heavy
foundation on my face and I think that's
a big reason why I keep gravitating
towards this one right now so this might
be better as my spring/summer foundation
as a version of the fall winter
foundation but I don't know when I first
got it I just kind of let it sit like I
tried it for you know the 5 or 6 times
or whatever that I tried foundation and
I was like I don't know it's just okay
to me and it kind of sat on my shelf
which is kind of there and I didn't
reach for it a lot and I'm the warmer
weather hit and one day I was like you
know what I'm just I'm in a hurry
stick foundations are super nice for
convenience and I thought I'm in a hurry
I'm just going to grab my I'm sad yet
and I used it and I was like wait again
why why didn't I like just thinking and
ever since then I would find myself
reaching for it more and more was a lot
of makeup tutorials on Instagram and
you've been seeing this guy and a lot of
them because I keep reaching for them
and as we've been traveling and going
out of town it seems like I'm always
grabbing
a BB cream one of my favorites more full
coverage foundations but that I'm also
grabbing the
a foundation I'm like how does this
happen how have I all of a sudden
changed my mind so drastically on the
obvious trick foundation I really don't
know what happened but I think maybe the
coverage factor does have a lot to do
with it because I like the lighter
coverage in the warmer weather months so
I think that we're going to be getting
along for the next couple months at
least but yes I'm sovietic foundation I
changed my mind for the better to an
item that I changed my mind about but
not so good is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills and Nicole Guerrero glow kit
I recently did post a video on best and
worst influence or collaborations and I
actually had to put this one in the
worst a category because it ended up
just not being for me this was one when
I first bought it I was like yes I love
it I love this highlights oh my gosh I'm
in Austin one day I was like no girl
does not look good on you you do not buy
what the highlight palette I don't know
if I let myself buy into the hype I'm
not really sure what it was and I don't
want to say that the highlight shades
aren't pretty because they are they're
pretty so some of the shades look too
decent on my skin I think one of my
issues is that I really only gravitated
towards this shade right here which is
forever lit and like sometimes I could
wear Forever Young but some of the other
shades were either too dark for my skin
tone or just kind of looked strange
there was only a couple of the shades
that I could use obviously Michael cake
this comes shattered that all my glow
kids come shattered so there's that that
shade is no longer with us but another
thing that I really started to not like
about this was that a lot of the shades
are glittery and I do have a texture on
my skin especially in the areas that I
highlight so I cannot wear stuff a lot
with glitter that will really emphasize
that texture because it just doesn't
look nice on my skin and I kept trying
this and I kept trying this and even
after I was like wait a second I don't
think that looks great on my skin I
still kept doing it I was like no you
got this girl you love that palette like
that if that's your located man you got
to wear it and I'm like no no it just
don't look good on me anymore so this
palette I have not reached for in a very
long time because I just it doesn't look
good on my skin anymore a lot of you
don't vibe on my face so and so
unfortunately I did change my mind about
the
and it's just no longer for me another
item that I've changed my mind about
that might come as a surprise to some
people are the colour-pop liquid
lipsticks the ultra matte and then also
the satin lips now I don't hate these
products reason why I've changed my mind
on these color palette lipsticks is
because when I first start wearing them
I was obsessed it was so hard for me not
to place orders for colour-pop lipsticks
especially when they're only six dollars
why I have changed my mind about them
recently is because a I don't even know
if I noticed it until I realized when I
was doing my organize with me blog that
I was like when's the last time I
reached for a color top liquid lipstick
I feel like it has been a while I am a
lipstick addict so I do have a very huge
lipstick collection but even still there
are those lipsticks or even both brands
of lipsticks that I'm consistently
reaching for it doesn't matter or
they're my go-to they're always in my
purse are always in my travel bag
something and it hasn't really been
colored pop and I'm like okay so what
happened what made me change my mind on
this is when I actually wore this was
what lipstick in particular this is the
shade perky and it was from one of their
holiday collections last year this was
one of my favorite shades I was obsessed
with it it was pink but like a dark pink
what kind of bright at the same time it
was one of the more unique lipstick
shades that I had ever worn it was one
of their ultra matte formulas but it was
super comfortable on the lips it stayed
so well and I was obsessed I weren't so
often almost like with time they just
get worse because I pulled this out
maybe a month ago to wear it and as I
put it on my lips I was like what is
this this is completely different the
color was completely different it was
much much darker almost like a dark
purple now and over time too it's almost
like the ellipse --tx starts to separate
I don't know if you can see that right
here like the lipsticks start to
separate into the tubes I mean a lot of
kind are doing them here is another one
that is completely separated another one
where it's separated a lot so when I use
an iPhone kind of to like shake them up
at first but it really is almost like
the color changes after
while in the tubes and I do not
appreciate that at all there's one other
shade I pulled out I work not too long
ago and I remember listing it in my
youtube video and also on Instagram and
people are like that the shade it looks
completely different well it was the
shade bieber right here bieber was one
of like one of like the cult classics
immediately with color pop everybody
wanted bieber was a super in trend color
and i worked you know maybe a couple
months ago but people are like that does
not look like bieber and I'm like I know
I completely agree with you but the
colors change on me I don't does anyone
else have this happen to them because
it's kind of strange to mean it kinda
has really irritated me but I know a ton
of people love the color pop lipsticks
and have really big collections probably
because they are so affordable so I
would actually really love to know if
anybody else has to tap into them but it
truly has made me not want to reach for
these because I'm like even though I
know some of these are my favorite
shades I don't know what I'm going to
get when I put them on my lips so that
is a really big reason why I changed my
mind about the color pop lipsticks
fortunately the color pop lipsticks have
a change my mind about and not for the
better
well some of drugstore foundations that
I actually changed my mind about are
these Maybelline foundation these two
are the fit me like the original fit me
foundations and this one is the fit me
matte and poreless I was so obsessed in
season especially when I first started
my youtube channel I was always
recommending me I was always wearing
these they were just like my go-to
foundations there may believe they're
drugstore they were a bit cheaper I
loved him I had so many good things to
say about them I know a lot of people
still really like these foundations but
I do not reach for the you think that I
think maybe it could have been is that
when I started wearing these I was
really getting into makeup I was
starting my beauty YouTube channels and
these are one of the first items that I
bought because I really liked Maybelline
it's been a brand that I've been wearing
for a long time because this is one of
the first like real foundations that I
started wearing I didn't have a lot to
compare it to yet so I was immediately
just like this is fantastic I look great
wearing foundation because I did
actually wear a ton of foundation until
a couple years ago as I started trying
out more like for sure there's some high
end and they're also very loyal to my
drugstore foundations I have quite a bit
I just found foundations that I liked a
lot but
than these so to me I think that's one
of the biggest things of why I love them
so much in the beginning was they didn't
have it time to compare them to they all
feel pretty heavy on the skin I realized
it very early on with the matte and
poreless I can really only wear this
with a very damp beauty sponge because
otherwise with a brush it just feels so
heavy and like cakey on my skin I do
think they oxidize a lot as well when I
put it on and then when I look like an
hour later the foundations are usually
much darker on me and they all I mean I
even have a different shade ranges all
pull really yellow on me and I know a
lot and I wore them in videos or
Instagram tutorials even a year back
people are like your foundation looks
terrible that is so yellow and I'm like
I know I'm like I'm trying to find
different shades that Maybelline
foundations have gone in my very rarely
used to roller and I definitely have
changed my mind on these a brand that I
have changed my mind about and that for
the better is two-faced you guys might
not be surprised if you've been
following my channel for a while
Too Faced used to be one of my favorite
brands it was one of the very first
high-end makeup brands that I was
purchasing from I actually used to be a
product reviewer for Too Faced back when
they first started in fact when I have a
blog that features both books and beauty
I would review makeup items a lot on
there I was contacted by Too Faced and
asked if they could send me early
products in order to get reviews not
only on the actual product itself but
the packaging and the marketability of
products and I did that for quite some
time I used to get a ton of free
products from Too Faced and to be able
to try out and they had really cool like
contests for us I don't even know what
you would call us them because I don't
even know if it was influencers but the
product reviewers we get entered in
these cool contest I want a bunch of
stuff I used to have a ton of to face
and then I continue to be very brand
loyal for two-phased I put a lot of
toothpaste in my early YouTube videos
and then it's just been within you know
maybe since last fall but I have noticed
a change in to face and I've definitely
changed my mind about them and I always
feel bad because I'm not someone who
enjoys fashion products or brushing
brands or bashing people it's really not
my style but Too Faced is one that I
really have changed my mind about
I have not bought anything from Too
Faced - since the white chocolate chip
palette and I believe that was either in
like November or December that I
purchased that palette and I have just
refused to buy anything from Too Faced
since then because there seems to be
like a consistent decline with that
brand and with the product and you know
that is of course for me personally I
know there's people out there that still
continue to love Too Faced support
Tuesdays and they like the products they
are coming out with but for me
personally I have not been loving it of
course there's other issues out there
stuff with social media stuff with
influencers backlash and not sort of
thing and you know drama and all that to
me you know I hear about it and I see it
I don't watch drama channels but I do
see things or people even will leave
comments to me like did you hear about
them doing this I'm like no I didn't
because I don't seek out drama but of
course I do hear it that is very sad to
me and so I feel like of course it's
that it is going to influence part of my
decision not to buy from them but at the
same time a bigger part is that I have
been buying some of their new releases
and I just hadn't been super impressed
with them so unfortunately Too Faced
it's so weird to me because just again
just one of my favorite brands I was so
into them for so long and now I just
really can't get into them I hope things
kind of change around I hope they can
slope upwards again I would love to see
that as well yeah as of right now I
definitely change from I had two faces
not for the better the last item that I
want to talk about is not necessarily
makeup or a brand but I want to talk
about eyebrows
so this might be really raised as what I
thought it could be something that I
could address because this was something
that I struggled with for a very long
time so before I started watching
YouTube and started my youtube channel I
did not know doing your eyebrows was it
they had no idea and I started YouTube
as a couple months in I will start
saying why don't you do anything with
your eyebrows what is wrong with you I
can't believe you under your eyebrows
have a beauty channel without doing your
eyebrows I would post tutorials on
Instagram and take all this time to
create these I love and to do these
wings liners and lashes people would
just hone in on the fact that I didn't
see my eyebrows it was super
discouraging and I was always pretty
down about it because to me it was kind
of crazy
you know you take your time to create a
video and put everything into it and buy
the equipment and take the time to film
and come up with the content ideas and
end of it and get it up there and market
your videos and the same thing for the
Instagram tutorial and all people can do
was hone in on the one thing that you
didn't do to their standards and it
really upset me and it actually made me
to the point where I was like why does
someone do my resin like I just don't
want to do it and what bums me out is
that I when the comments first started
coming in I was like oh okay I should
definitely learn how to do my eyebrows
before I started a YouTube channel I
wasn't big into makeup because I felt
like I couldn't do things right and it
discouraged me very quickly and I'm just
like okay find it I won't do it
I would give up very fast so when the
come and start coming in about eyebrows
I was like okay so I'm going to learn
and then I would try and I would do my
eyebrows and then that come on to come
in like your eyebrows look ridiculous
they look square they look boxy they
look too dark they're too light they're
too big I'm like oh my gosh I don't I
can't do anything right with the
eyebrows so I kind of just gave up I was
like well then I'm not going to do them
because this is just ridiculous and you
know I was getting so frustrated at the
comments but then what was interesting
to me was that I truly wanted to learn
how to do eyebrows I didn't know how to
do winged eyeliner either but I wanted
to learn and I did it so I kind of got
frustrated with myself that I let these
negative comments influence me in a
different direction that I wanted to go
I wanted to learn how to do eyebrows but
the comments got me so much that I
slipped and was like fine that I'm just
not going to do them but whatever I'm
just not even going to and that
frustrates me so it was kind of
something that I wanted to address in
this video talking about makeup I
changed my mind about because I changed
my mind a couple of times up
oh I am going to learn oh hell no I'm
not going to learn back to you know what
it was something that I wanted to learn
and I'm going to go ahead and try I just
kind of wanted to throw it out there
because I did change my mind about it
and there was a point in time where I
would be so frustrated about eyebrows
and I would mention it in YouTube videos
and be like well people are always mad
at me because they don't do my eyebrows
but whatever I wanted to mention that
because I've changed my mind a couple
different times on brows and I wanted to
just kind of address it here and then
also hope to insert a little piece of
like positivity
as well because it was something that I
realized a while back and I thought I
could make interesting a conversation
for a video so I thought that I would
include that in here but after we were
done talking about eyebrows I was going
to do it for makeup that I changed my
mind about I guess I was going to do it
for makeup that I changed my mind about
