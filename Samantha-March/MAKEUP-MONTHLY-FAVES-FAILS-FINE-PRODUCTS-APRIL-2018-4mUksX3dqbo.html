today's video is going to be my make up
monthly for the month of April if you
are new to my make up month place it is
similar to a monthly favorites monthly
favorite and fails video except I have
three different categories I talk about
my fails I talk about my favorites and I
talk about the products that were just
fine for me so just a whole bunch of
reviews in here I also like to do a
channel shout-out in my make up monthly
videos and then since I am a published
author and a book blogger at the end of
the video once we go through everything
makeup Beauty skincare related I will
share some book favorites from the month
as well so I always have a lot to chat
about in these videos so let me go ahead
and get started already so first off I'm
gonna talk about the products that did
not work for me that I had to put in the
fail category if you caught my recent
lipstick declutter I mentioned these in
that video these are the maybelline
superstay matte pink lipsticks and I
really do not like these and I'm super
bummed I put them in a video I think
when I was like pretending I had a gift
card and I was like shopping at a
drugstore and I put these in a video
because I feel like I hear a lot of
people talk about them and wear them so
I wanted to try them and they are
incredibly sticky but just they're just
too sticky for me to take they're fairly
long-lasting which is great but I can't
handle the level of stickiness on my
lips anytime I talk my lips are peeling
apart it just was too it was just too
annoying for me to want to wear these
are reach for these so I'm really bummed
about that I only do I find them to be
really sticky I feel like they transfer
on to my teeth a lot which is fairly
annoying and in that same regard I
actually have another one from
Maybelline that was a failed this is
their Vivat hot lacquer and I got mine
in the shade T's again same thing with
the liquid lips this is more of like a
glossy lip and again it's just it's
really sticky on my lips and I don't
like sticky glosses but this also like
it transfers oddly on to the teeth
because one time I was actually filming
a video and I had to look at my
viewfinder cuz I was like do I have like
what is on my teeth it's almost like it
creates like a fuzz on your teeth it's
not flattering at all it's not cute on
the lips so unfortunately both
maybelline superstay
Inc and their Vivat hot lacquer these
did not work for me and then next up
this item is a bit random but I did not
have a good experience with this this is
from the brand cocoa floss and its third
their floss for your teeth I did give
this sent to me from octa Lee and I was
excited to try it out so I feel like
I've seen people talk about it and
review it so when it popped up on my
octoly store I was like I'll give that a
shot I firmly believe in flossing your
teeth I did cliff lost my teeth twice a
day I have quite the sweet tooth so it's
just kind of always been drilled in me
to like try to do anything I can to help
my teeth and flossing is one of them so
I mean it's it's a cool brand like it's
cool packaging and all of that which
kind of makes floss a little bit more
exciting you can find Coco floss at
Sephora as well so then this is what the
actual floss looks like and it says this
is good for 60 days I believe it is it
supposed to be like a 60 day supply of
floss so I mean that looks like regular
floss so why this isn't the feel
category and why does this did not work
for me I I don't know what is different
about this floss from any other floss
I've ever used in my life but it gets
stuck between my teeth to the point
where I may have had tears coming out of
my eyes the other night when using it
because I couldn't get the floss out I
mean I definitely deal with like
overcrowding with my teeth like my top
like my two front teeth they overlap I
have teeth on the bottom row that
overlap it's always been like my goal to
get Invisalign I actually had it like
almost saved up for Invisalign
and then my husband proposed and got
married I was like okay I'll use that
money for our wedding so I've never
gotten Invisalign but I've always wanted
it so I don't I don't know but I mean
like I said I've lost my teeth twice a
day and I happened four years and I just
grabbed but the drugstore floss and I've
never had a problem and so I used it the
first night and I was panicking like I
was I was panicking and Mitch was like
what what is wrong I was like it's stuck
I physically can't pull this out and so
then he was trying to pull it out of my
mouth was like what is going on here so
then me being me decides to the next
night no I'll just do it again I'll just
skip that tooth like I was like maybe
just that particular tooth disart it got
stuck in between another tooth to the
point where once again Mitch
trying to help me pull it out of my
mouth and it was like disintegrating and
falling apart and I was like terrified I
thought I was gonna have a flaw stack
between my teeth forever
so I don't know I just had a really
weird experience with this so I don't
know if it's because I have overcrowding
in my teeth and if you do maybe don't
use this I don't know if it's just like
a oddly thick floss I don't know has
anyone ever had that experience with
dental floss in your life because that
was really scary to me so moving on to
my fine category I like to include it in
here because I like to review products
that's the main reason why I started my
channel and I always know like just
because something is an absolute
favorite of mine I can still recommend
it or maybe someone else will like it
based off my recommendations it's just
not you know I can't say like oh man
this is my absolute favorite product but
I still like it you know what I'm saying
okay so first up here I have this
concealer from covergirl this is the
vitalist healthy concealer so I did get
sent the big covergirl package I've been
reviewing like trying to review as many
items as I can out of there I have a top
5 bottom 5 of new drugstore releases
I'll leave it linked down below and I
think I have three products in there
from covergirl that I talked about but I
have my thoughts on the concealer now so
this is what it looks like it is one of
those like click up pens which is not my
favorite way like I prefer it just like
a standard doe foot applicator for my
concealer this isn't like my absolute
favorite but it's fine
this is $10.99 at the drugstore and I
think it's okay because it doesn't give
you a ton of coverage and I prefer full
coverage when it comes to my concealer I
just feel like I want everything to be
like concealed and beautiful and
fabulous on my under eyes and this
doesn't give me quite that amount of
coverage but if you're someone who you
don't need a kind of coverage and you
prefer more medium I think that you
could like this next up here I have
these new releases of from Sigma Beauty
they actually came out with 3 and these
are their eyeshadow base of primers this
is what one looks like and not something
that I expected that I would really
enjoy or like really need it in my life
these are $15 I do see the day that I'm
filming they are on sale for $12 at
Sigma I am a Sigma affiliate my code is
Samantha if you ever wanted to purchase
something from Sigma you can get 10% off
but when I got these in the mail I was
like okay I'll probably you know I'll
one I'll test it out to be able to
review it and you know I probably don't
need all three though and I'll give some
away or something I actually ended up
keeping and using all three that's how
much I like these I honestly would have
put them in a favorites category if it
wasn't for I don't know if there's like
a huge need for these kind of products
but I think that they're really freakin
good and I think for summer I'm going to
use them a lot so they have three
different shades and honestly I like all
of them and kind of for different
reasons what I kind of like these the
most for is just just putting them on my
eyes by themselves you can use them by
themselves you can use them as a primer
they are kind of like a little bit
sticky so this one is the shade persuade
there which this one might be my
favorite it might be my favorite but
like I said you can use it by yourself
or you can put shadows over it you can
put glitters over it anything like that
but I think that they're actually really
beautiful alone and this is the shade
sorbet and I actually was wearing this
in a recent video and that was all I had
on my eyelids I just like to put on
mascara and filmed a video I was like
that was so easy like there's no brushes
involved there's no tools involved
there's no blending involved there was
nothing I like just put this on and I
was good to go these are incredibly
long-lasting like these swatches are
probably going to be on my hand tomorrow
the first time that i swatched him when
i was talking about them on instagram it
was I want to say it was like eight
hours later six hours late or something
like that I shared another photo of my
hand and said tried scrubbing these off
they are incredibly long-lasting and
what I think these are gonna be awesome
for is days where like in the summer if
I'm going to be gone all day or if I'm
going to be boating or something like
that I typically don't wear any makeup
because things start to fade and like
you know can transfer onto your face
these guys are not budging on the eyes
so I think just like a light layer of
this for like your beach day or whatever
I think it's gonna be awesome so I
actually prefer to use these on their
own just as eyeshadows as is but they
are really nice as eyeshadow primers or
an eyeshadow base as well because
they're a little bit on that sticky side
they really grab onto your eyeshadows
and make them stay in place so I was
actually really impressed with these and
was not expecting that so next up I have
a product here from a Kevin
kuan I really enjoy kevin aiklen or
kevin macleod beauty i find so many
products that i really enjoy from this
brand this is the neal elixir weightless
beauty oil this was sent to me in PR I
think the packaging is really nice on it
a really nice bottle and all of that so
what I'd like to use facial oils I use
them a lot I used one today on my face
actually not this one but I used one
before I put my foundation on especially
because I have dry skin
I feel like oils just kind of help
especially if I'm really suffering with
dry patches which right now I am on my
forehead and I'm still trying out the
Sunday Riley influencer foundation and I
feel like that foundation really shows
dry patches so I've definitely been
using oils more so I was excited when I
got this one and I was testing it out it
feels really nice on the skin that says
it's weightless I agree with that it's a
very light weight on the skin it kind of
helps just make you a little bit more on
the glowy side again especially as we go
into warmer months here I feel like I'm
really going to be busting out my oils a
lot as well the bad part about this is
that the cap is broken and like would
that be a big deal
no but I don't know if I've heard
anybody reviewing this saying that their
cap isn't broken and even just consumers
like not bloggers I've got I sent in PR
but consumers who are actually
purchasing it are telling me that their
cap is broken so I believe this is fifty
two dollars and fifty two dollars for
clearly what is some sort of product
manufacturing error issue somewhere
along the way that's a little bit
strange to me but I basically can't use
this little dropper here the cap just
does not work it broke off and now it's
gonna break I mean it's just I'm like
what what is happening here I don't
maybe that's I don't know maybe that's
the way it's supposed to be I thought is
kind of weird to me but everybody else
that I have seen review or talk about
this again bloggers or consumer has
mentioned the cap is that way so I don't
that's where I'm like maybe it's
supposed to be that way but that seems
really friggin weird to me but other
than that I think it's pretty decent
again does everybody need a facial oil
no do I need a facial oil every single
day No
so this is a pretty high price at $52
for a facial oil but it's still very
nice if you like facial oils if you use
them a lot like me it could be one that
you can
that are next up I have an item here
from pixie Beauty I feel like I've been
pretty tough on the pixie pretties
collaboration but pixie is a higher
price brand and when they come out with
items like I you know I'm really trying
to see if they're worth it or not
I'm pretty sure I got kicked out there
PR list which is totally fine
but I actually found one that I think is
pretty good not a favorite of course but
I think it's pretty good this is the
pixie in collaboration with Chloe
Morello palette called the Chloe palette
in romantic romance so you have blush
shades I shades and then like liner and
brow shades in here so this is what it
looks like and I really really enjoyed
these blushes in here I think they're
really beautiful I think they're very
pigmented I think they look really nice
on the skin it so I definitely been
reaching in here a lot for the blushes
now this is $24 so I mean if you just
think of it as a blush palette and you
get the three blushes in here $24 I mean
not as crazy as some other blush
palettes but you also do get some
bonuses in here and the eyeshadows are
nice they're pretty light and you kind
of have to build them up the ones that
I've tried but they're nice and then you
also have these kind of like brow
powders or liners over here I haven't
even touched that because that's not
what I use that's not what I do for my
brows or typically my liner but the
lighter shades are pretty in here but
again I think the blushes are what steal
the show afford this palette and is
really nice I've been reaching into this
palette just because I think the blushes
are really beautiful and I feel like
they're long lasting on the skin so I'm
still trying out some other items from
the pixie pretties collection but like I
said since they're higher priced I mean
I I try to be fair in my reviews and
some things I think are worth it some
things I don't think are worth it and
you know that's just my opinion a lot of
people get Scott sent that p.r package
and I know a lot of people really like
things out of them which is great but
for me I thought this one was pretty
good last night I might have in the fine
category is from Leah Hendrickson this
is the transforming walnut scrub and I
really enjoy it little Hendrickson I
should have a skincare favorites video
up I'm pre filming a little bit cuz I'm
gonna be out of town in Oklahoma City
for four days so I'm trying to get on my
videos film so I can just be editing
while I'm out of town but that video
should go up I mentioned quite a few
favorites in there this one I think is
just okay for me and against the
transforming walnut scrub with walnut
powder and ginseng extract so it's a
little mini I purchased a trio of mini
from Allah Hendrickson a couple months
back this is now my third and final
review from the trio's in there one I
didn't like it all one was a favorite
ivory purchased this one fell in the
middle for me this one in the shower
like I do most of my scrubs and I think
that it's like it's just okay for me I
still prefer the the Sonia scrub it's a
little on the gritty side and because I
have sensitive skin like sometimes when
I get out of the shower my skin is like
begging for like an oil or like a
nourishing serum or something to put on
it because it's just a little bit on the
gritty side not as much as the other one
that was in the scrub which was like the
almond scrub not as much as that one but
still enough that it's kind of tough a
very little bit goes a long way cuz it's
kind of like a liquidy and runny as well
so a little bit goes a long way I've
been trying this one out in my shower
for a while and I feel like I'm just
finally starting to put a dent into it
I'm not crazy about the way that it
smells and again it just I noticed that
my skin is just a little bit irritated
after I use it so it's not my absolute
favorite I don't dislike it like I won't
like I'll continue to use it until it's
gone I just prefer this on a scrub but
from Allegra's in so before I jump into
my makeup and beauty favorites I want to
do my channel shoutout I love doing
these every single month and just
recommending another youtuber that I
absolutely love so this month I have
everyday Heidi I recently found her
channel within the last couple months
here and I just love watching her videos
that she posts a lot she's very
consistent in uploading and I just
always look forward to her videos I feel
like she's a similar style channel to me
she likes to talk about makeup and she
has some chatty videos but then she also
does tutorials on her channel too and
her get ready with me videos she's one
who definitely likes to experiment with
color and I always get pretty inspired
by her eye looks that she has seems very
relatable and very personable on camera
so I've just really been enjoying
watching her videos how I do my channel
shoutouts is every single month I do
send out a beauty focused newsletter I
have some other reviews in there I
picked standout products in there I
talked about some new makeup releases
but I also do an interview with another
beauty blogger so this month's
newsletter has not gone out yet I do
always have a link to sign up if you're
interests it down below like I said it
only goes out once a month but then I do
have just a little short to interview
with a beauty blogger in there so if you
would want to see a little interview
with everyday Heidi you can sign up for
the newsletter I will also leave her
channel of course linked it down below
if you are not yet watching her I think
that you should so moving on to with
some Beauty favorites I have some more
covergirl in here and I am really
excited over these these are some new
liquid lipsticks from covergirl they are
called there in the covergirl Queen
collection and they are the major shade
lipsticks I do have a shade on today
actually this one is called a Bey I just
wanted something like find kind of fun
and coral today so I reached for this
one but my other two favorites are
cakewalk and then also insider and I
believe I've warned both of these in
videos and I'm just really enjoying
these I think that they are really solid
liquid lipsticks they're about eight or
nine dollars depending on where you're
gonna get them at I did notice they're
not available on the Ulta website yet
which I thought was kind of strange but
I've seen them like in my CVS so I don't
know what that's about but again I
really do like these I think that they
feel very comfortable on the lips for a
liquid lipstick it pretty much feels
like you're not even wearing anything
but they have a really good lasting
power the first time that I used it I
was actually out of town with my husband
and I put it on in the morning and you
know just wanted to see how at war and
we went out for lunch and I ordered a
pork tenderloin sandwich and so I'm
eating this sandwich and I remember
getting done and I go hey what does my
lipstick look like testing out a new
lipstick I was just wondering what it
looked like he goes it looks the same as
when you sat down and I was like no but
okay that's cute whatever I was like
that was stupid ass gum and we get back
in the truck and I flipped down the
mirror and I look and I was like oh my
gosh it looks exactly like however when
I sat down to eat lunch like what and
that was a big old sandwich that I ate
so I think these have really good
lasting power I've been very impressed
with them the only downside I'll say is
that they're kind of thin so you kind of
have to build them up a little bit like
I think I did like three on the bottom
lip and three on the top lip so that's
the only bad thing about them but other
than that they're very comfortable and
they're very long-lasting the big props
the covergirl I think those are pretty
solid next up I have a blush here this
is from the brand collab or collab
beauty you can find them on the cool
website and then also at Sally's Beauty
but it's a pretty interesting brand they
took a bunch of beauty bloggers Beauty
influencers and they all collapse on an
entire makeup collection
I did get the collection sent to me in
PR and I've just kind of been slowly
trying out the products in there but one
of the first things I reached for ugly
enough was the blush and I think this
blush is really beautiful I have it's
called the soft spot soft spot sheer
blush and mine is in the shade just for
fun and again I think this is a really
beautiful kind of like a neutral blush I
think this is around at ten dollars or
so again it's not gonna be like the most
easily accessible items to get but I
thought again this was very nice and
very pigmented but not like overly
pigmented and I really like the color
Tina I was very impressed with it I've
been reaching for it I've quite a bit
lately except I want to talk about these
bronzers from the ball
oh I freaking love make me so excited
okay so these are new items are from the
balm I of course will have them linked
down below I believe they're now like
$17 1758 I want to say and I do have
three different shades now this one here
is Oscar and I actually used this as a
contour shade this one is a really nice
contour shade on me it's pretty light
and it also seems to be pretty like cool
toned and the one that I use as my
actual bronzer is tawny which looks like
this and you do have a mirror in each of
them as well which i think is great
they also have a third shade which is
called Grammer I think it's Graeme I
think it's what it's called that one is
too dark for me right now but these are
the two that I reach for again for
contour and then also for bronzer I
freaking love these I think the powder
is so smooth I think it blends out super
easily I've really been enjoying these I
reach for them a lot I actually might
reach for uh score more as the contour
shade but Toni again is a really nice
bronzer on my skintone so I'm very
impressed with these these are at the
forefront of my drawer because I'm
reaching for them so much next up is
something a little bit more on the
random lifestyle vibe for me but I've
really been loving this new one so this
brain does not new to me it's defined me
which is a perfume I have had Delphine
for quite some time and it's actually
made it in a past favourites video of
mine but I recently just got a new scent
and this is called Audrey and it smells
so good so this is kind of like my main
favorite at the moment but I have
Delphine as well so I thought I'd pull
her out
this is a really cool brand you can find
to find me at Ulta and I think the brand
is really cool I definitely suggest
looking up kind of seeing their story
their packaging is really cute and I
love kind of like each of the different
women's name for each of them and they
even have like own little like sketch of
each girl that goes along with the
perfume I think it's really cute but
again this is what the bottle looks like
this is my new scent Audrey and she
smells so good I'm not a huge perfume
person I think mostly because I work
from home I'm usually not trying to
impress anyone except my dog who's
currently snoring so clearly I'm doing a
terrible job but when I go out I do like
to wear perfume so I like to have a few
of like my staples and these ones are
definitely my staples this one I really
like because I'm more of like a light
and sweet fragrance that's that's what I
prefer when it comes to mind and this
scent really nails it for me
Delphine is just a little bit a little
bit she has a little bit more I have no
idea how to describe perfume so I would
just suggest looking up the notes if
that's something that you go off of a
lot I don't really know how to do that
yet so I just kind of like guess but
this one has just a little bit more umph
to it where Audrey is just for me it's
like the perfect snack for me right now
just super light but a little bit on the
sweet side and a funny story about this
I was wearing it the other night when I
went to a concert and I met a girl there
and I was talking to her for a while and
she said what are you wearing and I said
oh do you mean my outfit or my makeup
and she said no your perfume and I was
like oh it's this and I actually had it
in my clutch with me and I pulled it
right out I was like it's called to find
me and the scent is off a tree you can
find out I'll do Beauty which was super
funny um but again a big fan of this
brand ass item that I want to talk about
again is a little bit more random but I
feel like I've been getting asked a lot
of questions lately I've been getting
ass on Twitter I've been getting asked
on snapchat so I thought I would throw
it in here it's the website the fitness
app I guess that I use I share like on
snapchat and on Instagram stories I
share whatever workout I'm doing that
day I typically do workout every single
day I just enjoy fitness it's a big part
of my life and my lifestyle and I think
it's important to do whenever I'm using
the website Crocker is what I use I
typically will share like a screenshot
of what workout I'm do
just to like hopefully motivate people
like Oh have I done my workout today or
oh should I go do a 60-second wall squat
you know whatever it is so I like to
share them but then I could ask so many
questions of what it is that I'm using
I've been sharing my yoga photos more on
Twitter as well so people are always
asking me what is it that you do for
fitness
I almost I use Crocker almost every
single day sometimes I'll just do like
my own yoga routine because I do
practice daily but Gregor I've been
using for probably I mean it's I'm gonna
say like four years or something like
that it's been a really long time I
actually joined Crocker when they were a
very new website and I just got hooked
on it they have so many different
workouts in there I do a lot of my yoga
work workouts on there they have a so
many good cardio strength training
kickboxing I mean even they really have
anything that you want over there so I
will leave a link down below I am a
rocker affiliate so that link is an
affiliate link but you can get a I think
it's a two week free trial if you want
to see if it's something that would work
for your lifestyle and something that
works good for you for fitness for me it
does I don't have a gym membership I
don't have a trainer I like doing my
workouts at home or works out for me the
best and I like that they have a lot of
different varieties if you like yoga I
would suggest Celeste Celeste I can't
think of her last name at the moment and
then also Laura Birkhead or Burkhardt
I'll leave their names in my description
box too and if you like really good
cardio like you're gonna sweat a ton
Sara cush is my favorite trainer on
Gregor by far I'm currently doing her
workouts they are so hard they are so
intense but like I feel like she's just
getting my body ready for summer so I
highly recommend rocker again if it's
something that works for your lifestyle
some people do need to go to a gym they
need to do classes and things like that
for me I don't and I prefer doing them
from the comfort of my home and I like
not being able to leave and I like being
able to pick my workouts and you can
make a calendar on there which is what I
do but I just noticed I've been kind of
getting an influx and questions and I
don't know if it's because I've been
posting on IG stories more I'm not sure
if it's because my yoga photos that I've
been posting I wasn't sure but I thought
I would throw it in here because that's
just like oh is a favorite of mine but
that's gonna do it for my makeup and
beauty favorites like I said I am
talk about some book favorites next but
I know not everybody needs book
recommendations so if this is where
you're ending I thank you so much for
watching I hope you have a fabulous May
but if you want to get Osama reading a
recommendations let's jump into those I
am starting to lose the Sun it's
starting to set so I'll try to get
through these very quickly I only have
two this month so I do have a book blog
it's called chocolate plus I'll have it
linked down below so how I choose the
books to mention in this video is any
books that I gave a five-star review to
I will have each book link down below to
Amazon and also to my review if you want
to see it but the first book that I have
is called the secret to southern charm
and this is by Christie what's in Harvey
now this book is a sequel to slightly
south of simple which I read that book
as well and I would highly recommend
reading both books because I think that
you would be too lost if you just
started reading the sequel because we
follow a lot of women there's a lot of
characters in here and even like I would
say for the first three chapters I was
kind of like okay so we have the
grandmother and then we have the mother
and then we have her kids and then they
have kids it was kind of like how it did
everybody play out again how did the
last book end up so I think that it's
really beneficial if you read both but
it's really strong women's fiction like
I said there's a lot of female
characters that you get in there and
just so many different plot points that
it sounds like it could be overwhelming
to read but again if you've read the
first book I think it'll just take you a
little bit to get right back in the
swing of things and I think especially
if you read them back-to-back I think
that would be the best especially to do
with like family connections sisterly
bond mother-daughter bonds so I really
really did enjoy that one so that is the
secret to southern charm by Christie
Woodson Harvey the next one I have is
called open season and this is by Alissa
Schindler this one is more it's like
women's fiction but it has has a bit of
like suspense to it because there is a
murder that happens in the book that we
read about right away and so the book is
kind of trying to figure out there was a
murder in suburbia you know the the kids
is Little League coach got murdered on
the field who could have done this why
would this have happened and so we kind
of go through the different you know
suspects who possibly could have done it
and you kind of get a look into suburbia
and you know some of the some of those
secrets that lie behind closed doors and
I thought this book was a Fanta
I was having a great time reading it I
like reading suspense and thriller
novels this one isn't - like it's not
scary and it's not like over-the-top
gory or anything like that it's just
more suspenseful and like you're trying
to figure out who did it
type of thing but there's a twist at the
end and to me I was already having a
great time reading this book and then
when that happened I was like yes
didn't see that coming but that was
freaking awesome so I highly recommend
this book if that sounds like a genre
that you enjoy I think that you would
really like that one so again it's open
season by Alyssa Schindler but after
that that is going to do it for my
makeup monthly for April all of my
favorites my fails my fine products my
channel shout out my book
recommendations I hope that you guys
