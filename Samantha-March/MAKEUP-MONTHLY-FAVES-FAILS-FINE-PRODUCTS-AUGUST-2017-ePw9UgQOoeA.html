today's video is going to be at my make
up monthly from the month of August I
know I always do these so late and I'm
so sorry but it is going to be my make
up monthly today I'm going to be talking
about some of my favorites my fails and
the products that I thought were just
okay that I was testing out in the month
of August if you're ready to see some of
my thoughts on makeup that I was testing
out in the month of August why don't we
go ahead and get started I'm gonna start
off with the fine category so these were
a few items that I thought were just
okay first up I'm gonna be starting with
the a subculture pellet from uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills I do have a full review
video on this palette I was one who I
did not mind this palette it didn't turn
into a favorite for me but I didn't
return it still holding it I still think
it works just fine I reached for it
several several times I continue to
reach for it I think the shades in here
are super unique it's definitely tricky
to work with these shadows but not
anything that I couldn't get the hang of
I feel like I'm creating looks just fine
with this palette and I'm having a good
time with it I'm keeping mine again it's
just not my favorite palette I
definitely don't think it's a palette
for everybody for sure but if you want
to get my full thoughts
I'll have that video down below but the
still culture pella from Anastasia I
thought was pretty good and then I have
a three lip products to talk about next
so next up I want to talk about these
Avon lipsticks Avon sent me an insanely
insanely amazing package actually a
three drawer like acrylic drawer and
even had my name on it it was the
coolest thing it was full of Avon
lipsticks it seriously was the coolest
thing so I've been trying out some of
these Avon lipsticks and I wouldn't be
able to classify them as my favorites
but I also don't think like they were
terrible or the worst of lipstick ever
they are a regular lipstick formula so
this one is called tender kiss so that's
what it looks like and I'll just do a
swatch so you can see it here so that
one is tender kiss from Avon I noticed
that all of the lipsticks well I haven't
tried every single one of them on my
lips but the majority of the lipsticks
that they sent they have kind of like
almost like a little bit of sparkle to
them the other one that I grabbed
I was in blush nude and I'll do a swatch
of that one too
I don't know if you can tell on camera
but each of them just kind of have a
certain Sheen to them like they're not
really glittery but but they have just a
bit of sparkle to them I noticed that
with almost every single one of the lip
glosses that I've tried from what Avon
sent me I think that they're really nice
they're very creamy on the lips they
feel really good but I did notice that
they fade extremely extremely quickly I
was wearing one of the colors when I
filmed a video and it was one of those
instances where I got done filming and
like the entire middle part of my lip
had already worn away and I am just not
used to that so if I would have just
looked at myself quickly while I was
filming I could have done a touch-up but
I didn't even realize it so by the end
of the video of my lipstick looks pretty
crummy but that is but you know pretty
common with more of a traditional
lipstick they do wear away easily but
they're also super easy to reapply out
whereas liquid lipsticks can be a bit
harder to do so while I didn't think
this was you know my absolute favorite
most amazing lipstick I do think they're
really pretty and they do feel really
nice in the lips and they had a huge
huge variety of shades to choose from
next up I want to talk about the Mac lip
glasses I also received an amazing pair
package from Mac Oh a couple of months
back it was one of the more overwhelming
packages I've I've received and it was
pretty crazy but I was really excited
because inside they had a variety of
their lip glasses and I had never tried
those this is like Mac's lip glosses and
I have come to realize that I actually
really like these particular is called
candy box so this is what the packaging
looks like and I mean it's a pretty
standard lip gloss but I thought it was
actually like really decently pigmented
so this is candy box right there it has
some really decent pigments who had a
really been loving candy box it
continues to sit on my desk because a
lot of times I'm putting it over
lipsticks I was just mentioning in one
of my recent get ready with me videos
that I have a couple of nude lipsticks
that are just like way too nude like
almost like the concealer lips on me and
I kept reaching up for this candy box
because it has that nice pink lip gloss
to it where it's still it's giving me
that glossy look but Fitness ad
just a little bit more color back into
my lips so this one has been sitting on
my desk
I'm not a huge lipgloss person I don't
gravitate towards them a ton so I really
want to be able to consider it a
favorite I don't wear these alone myself
I'm always wearing them over a lipstick
but I still know that they were pretty
nice so I wanted to mention them because
if you really love lip glosses I feel
like you would really enjoy these and I
have really been liking them I thought
they were pretty darn decent and then
the last product I want to mention is a
liquid lipstick this is from a makeup
forever this is one of their what are
they called the artist liquid matte
lipsticks mine is in the shade of 103 I
picked mine up from Sephora
I got this off a recommendation from
Jaclyn hill she had a video once I don't
even know if it was a I think it was a
favorite and she mentioned all of these
different nude lipsticks in there and
she talked about the Make Up For Ever
formula and how much she loved it so I
went out and purchased one and I wasn't
as impressed as I thought maybe I would
be I still think it's nice I still kept
it I think this was twenty dollars or
just above twenty dollars everything
will be linked down below didn't return
it or anything because I still thought
it was decent
it just didn't blow me away like I may
be expected to though this one is what
the 103 from makeup forever looks like I
think I just didn't like it because it
ended up being more drying than I
expected it to be I know that liquid
lipsticks are drying but I feel like
there's a lot of liquid lipstick
formulas coming out right now that are
not as drying and are still really
long-lasting it also did flake pretty
boat on my lips like this was one that
again after filming a video I had to go
back in and retouch up my lips because I
was like oh no like where did my
lipstick go on the inner part of my lips
oh it's not a complete feel for me and
like I said I'm not gonna return it I'll
keep it around and I'll continue to wear
it but this is one where I always will
have to wear a lip liner underneath and
fill in my entire lips because it does
start to wear away pretty quickly and I
like to have that lip liner color
underneath so when this starts to wear
away it's not just like boom my bare lip
and then it looks really weird so not my
favorite not a complete fail it was just
alright so moving on to the fill
category I only have two products so
that is pretty good if you watched my
full face first
questions follow-up video I actually did
mention both of these in there but the
first one unfortunately is from morphe
brushes i really do enjoy morphe as a
brand i like a lot of their products but
unfortunately their concealer did not
work out for me at all I mentioned this
one too in my least favorite products
from my favorite brands video I'll link
that one down below and like I said I
enjoy a lot of items from working but
the concealer did not work it is a very
very drying formula like right away you
put it on and you got like five seconds
to blend that out otherwise it's gonna
dry and look very strange on your eye
but it also it just was kind of I don't
even feel like it was a heavy concealer
but I feel like once it did dry it
looked heavy on my skin it did
necessarily feel it or it like wasn't
full coverage but it just looked very
cakey and heavy on my skin I just we did
not work out the morphe concealer
unfortunately and then the other feel
that I had was from ardell this was
there a stroke of brow feathering brow
pen and no I could not get a handle on
this on and this is what it looks like
it has a very flimsy like very flimsy
felt tip style and I just could not get
the hang of it I'm still I still
consider myself very very new to browse
the only item that I feel like I've
really been able to get a handle on is
brow pencils I've tried pomades I tried
the dip brow and now I have tried the
stroke of brow and I just can't I can't
get a handle on it yet I'm not
comfortable with anything else other
than a pencil so this one did not work
for me either I will not be trying out
the struggle brow anymore I tried it I
was able to give my review and then now
we are done so unfortunately these were
my two fails for the month
neither one worked for me so now I'm
going to move over into my favorites so
I have you know makeup and beauty and
some skincare and even brushes to talk
about I introduced a new section two new
sections last month that in my makeup
monthly videos I'm also going to mention
a favorite like Beauty influencer and
how I was going to do that was I sent
out a Beauty newsletter about every
month and in there I feature a fellow
Beauty influencer and I
have their links in there there are
social media links their photo and I
just have a short interview and there
with them to feature them because I like
to share about my friends I consider you
know a lot of these other gals and a lot
of these other youtubers my friends so
it's fun to kind of like promote each
other and and share and things like that
so I want to do that going forward but I
have not sent out a newsletter yet this
month a little bit behind it's actually
pulled up on my computer right now I am
working on it so I don't have anyone to
feed you yet because I haven't actually
sent the newsletter it out so it'll be
in next month's video i'll feature who i
put out in my september newsletter
because i'm just a little bit behind
this month i'm gonna sign up for my
newsletter yet I will have it linked
down below I just have some further
makeup reviews and I are standout
products I always feature a full of
beauty bloggers at like I said and then
I talked about like some new makeup
releases and things like that or is that
but then the other category that I
introduced was I wanted to talk about
some of my book favorites from the month
if you do not know I am a book blogger I
am also a published author so I do a ton
of book reviews over on my blog which is
chiclet plus and I've been continually
getting asked to somehow work books into
my videos so I thought in my makeup
monthly I could mention some of my
favorite books the books that I gave 5
star reviews to which is the highest
rating that you can write books on
Amazon what I'm gonna do first is run
through the makeup and beauty and
skincare and then once that is done if
you are still interested in hearing
about the books then I will get into
that but if you're only here for the
makeup of beauty I'm gonna do that
category first and you can click off of
that if that was the only thing that you
want to see if you aren't a big reader
thank you to all the suggestions and
feedback because I do think that's a
really good idea because when I did it
last time I did books and then I
finished with makeup of beauty but I
totally understand that this is a beauty
channel and a lot of you are coming to
see my beauty favorites so that is how
I'm gonna do it so I appreciate the
feedback so much so jumping into some
Beauty favorites is starting off with
skincare and the month of August and
still now in the first couple weeks into
September I'm completely obsessed with
this this is from pixie beauty it is
their peel and polish this is what it
looks like and I am just loving it back
it says it is a radiance revealing
enzyme peel says natural fruit enzymes
exfoliate and polish lifting white dead
skin cells to reveal a more smooth
radiant and healthy complexion let's use
two to three times a week
I typically
this one to two times a week because I
do have sensitive skin so sometimes if
I'm using something like an appeal or a
very powerful exfoliant I can only use
it the one or two times a week otherwise
my skin can kind of react a little bit
strangely they haven't really loving
this I enjoy a lot from the pixie Beauty
skincare line I have tried a lot of
their skincare I'm super lucky to be on
the pixie Beauty PR mailing list so I've
gotten a lot of their skin care to try
and I've been impressed with a lot of it
but this peel and polish I continually
keep reaching for some more skin care I
have is actually a sheet mask of this is
from pathology this is their smart mud
no med mud mask I did a skincare
favorites video recently and I mentioned
this and I actually kind of showed how I
apply it and what it looks like on so
I'll have that video linked down below
and I am still just digging this mask
because I love like the charcoal mask or
the mud mask or some of my favorite
masks to use because I feel like they're
just really kind of like pulling
everything out of my skin but I feel
like I'm having it's usually on the
weekends where I feel like maybe I'm
lacking in my skincare I haven't done a
lot of sheet masks I haven't been really
like exfoliating and just cleaning my
skin then this is what I'm reaching for
because right here on the back it says
it's the neatest way to clear up your
complexion and dispose of pore clogging
debris so it really pulls everything out
of your pores and now the reason why I
like this sheet mask so much is because
they are easy and they are not messy a
lot of times with a mud mask or a
charcoal mask you're getting it all over
your fingers and then you're getting it
in your hair and then it's all over your
sink and you're having to clean and then
when you're washing it off and then
clear your face now you have the excess
mask also on your towel like it is just
kind of a disaster and I've just always
put up with it because I enjoy them but
because this is a sheet mask it's like
it's like a total freaking game-changer
I do have a code with pathology it is
Samantha 25 I'll leave it on the screen
and down below it would get you 25% off
at the pathology website full of Ecology
sheet masks and I do recommend them
quite a bit it's not an affiliate code
so I don't make any Commission off of it
it's just a discount code for you but if
you love mud masks or charcoal masks but
you don't like the mess of them I would
say try out the sheet masks because I
think they'll be a game-changer for you
too I recently did a
brand makeup tutorial using everything
from flower beauty and I wanted to
pinpoint one product I know I kept
mentioning in that video how much I
absolutely love this but I really want
to make sure I hit it home because this
little palette here is just so good I
still cannot stop reaching for it I love
all of the shades in here this is called
their lift and sculpt contouring palette
and it is in medium to deep so you have
the three different shades in here you
have a really nice bronzer a blush and
then a highlighter and all three are
absolutely stunning the highlight is a
beautiful goal if you love gold
highlights that highlight is gorgeous
but the bronzer and the blush just this
entire palette worked out so well for me
and I continually keep reaching for it I
think it is so gorgeous so the lip and
sculpt contouring palette from flower
Beauty I still keep reaching for this
one moving on I have two foundations to
talk about I have been on a foundation
pick recently I'm just having the best
time trying that different foundations
oh no I actually have I have like three
foundation ish type products okay so the
first two are actual foundations this
one is from Lancome this is the 10th it
dole Ultra wear foundation this is what
it looks like this is what I have on my
face today and I think it is absolutely
gorgeous I did receive this from oculi
octa laser sight that connects brands
and bloggers you can apply to get
products into in exchange for review I
was so thrilled because the Lancome
agreed to send me this foundation and I
am so freaking impressed I think it
looks so beautiful on the skin I always
get compliments when I wear this it is
such a long wearing foundation it's like
up to 24 hours I don't think I've ever
tested the 24 hour clamp or really even
gotten close to that but I can put this
on in the morning and it can last
throughout the entire day I've been so
so impressed I shade is in 320 bisque
warm is the shade that I have that I
think is working out really well for me
but yes it is a long last thing it looks
so good on the skin it's more of a
medium to full coverage but I think it's
more medium which is exactly where I
like my foundations to be forty seven
dollars I think the packaging is so
beautiful but I love that I love the
finish I love the way it looks I love
the coverage I've just been really
digging this line
foundation another one I have is
actually I got a sample at Sephora which
was one up there like weekly specials
and I was like you know I've been
hearing a lot about this foundation if
they're gonna give me a sample for free
I'm just gonna go ahead and try it out
it's the Laura Mercier flawless fusion
ultra long wear foundation so this is
what my little sample guy looks like and
woah woah have I been impressed with
this this is a full-coverage foundation
and I typically do not love full
coverage I just think it looks I just I
feel like when I wear full coverage I
feel like it looks like I'm wearing
foundation I feel like all the full
coverage foundations I've tried it just
looks heavy on my skin it looks like I'm
wearing a lot of makeup and I just don't
gravitate towards that I do not feel
that way with this foundation the first
time I wore it I immediately went on my
snapchat was like guys I am digging this
foundation and I don't even have it
fully on my face yet like I was still
blending it out but I was like I already
can tell I can already tell that I am
just digging it I could definitely
notice that it is very full coverage
with full coverage I just feel like
you're putting on another layer of skin
I don't know how to describe it but full
coverage to me has just always freaked
me out for that reason but it did not
look too heavy on my skin it didn't look
like I was wearing a ton of makeup it
didn't cake up on me at all very very
long lasting it says the ultra long wear
foundation I would agree with that it is
super long lasting the shade that I
picked up is in buff this is $48 for a
full size and I would repurchase it
I would 100% repurchase this foundation
the other one and that I have that I was
like I'm not really quite sure how to
describe this this is from Urban Decay
and this is their one and done
so Brenda Kay sent me a really amazing a
PR package which was super exciting was
the first package that he received from
Urban Decay and inside was this one and
done I honestly had never heard about
this like if I had seen other people
talk about it in YouTube videos then it
just kind of went in one ear and out the
other because I was like one and done
what's that and I was showing the box on
my snapchat and so many people are
writing in like I love that one and done
so I was like okay I'm going to try it
and instantly became obsessed
continually continually reached for this
I went on a camping trip in August this
is what I took with me what knew that I
was going to be outside all day and I
didn't
want a lot of foundation on but I still
wanted something to smooth out my face
and just make my face look better
without having a ton of makeup this is
what I was reaching for I don't know if
you guys can tell by looking at it but
you can see that like I've been
squeezing some product out of this
because I've just been really diggin it
the shades that I am in right now is
medium so reading from the spore website
it says it's alisa instantly and
completely blur imperfections even out
skin tone and it doesn't look overdone
and I would agree with that it's like a
primer but with a little bit of a boost
I have just found it and truly obsessed
with this the Urban Decay one and done
sold have some brushes to talk about
these are from Mota brushes these are
all from their metallic line they did
send me their metallic line and I was
super stoked
I love brushes I just did a brush to
clutter and that was a very hard day for
me but I was really excited to test
these out in these three I've just been
having the best time with this one is
the mo5 and I have and this one is what
I've been using for bronzer and then
this one is the mo3 and this is what
I've been using for a contour I feel
like it gets right up and they're really
really easily and then this other one I
know this might not be like a sexy use
or anything this is called the super
crease but this is what I've been using
to put like a the first shadow all over
my eye like a white shade or a beige or
whatever it is to kind of set my eyelid
primer this is what I just keep reaching
for I think these brushes are super
beautiful I love the metallic feel to
them but I can tell that they're also
really good quality have washed both of
these brushes and I feel like they are
still in really really good shape
sometimes you watch a brush even for the
first time and it just kind of like
falls apart and you can't get it shaped
back three motor brushes from the
metallic line I've been very impressed
with so this is kind of random but I
have an eye shadow to talk about just a
single eyeshadow so this is my makeup
geek Z palette in here and the shade
that I am currently obsessed with is
this one right here in the corner this
one is called unexpected might seem like
a really random shade to enjoy so
there's a swatch of it it's just a
really nice light like kind of like
purple lilac color and I know that might
not seem like much but I think it is
absolutely gorgeous and I honestly have
been using this a lot as a crease color
I think I did a summer makeup too
a couple months back if I can find it I
will link it down below but I'm using
this as a crease color a lot typically I
go in with like you know your standard
brown but I keep reaching for this one
and unexpected I think it is absolutely
stunning it just gives a really cool
different vibe to the eye look and I've
also used it all over my lid I thought
it was beautiful and I've also used it
as a lower lashline color and I think
it's a gorgeous like it's such like a
random color but I still wanted to
mention it and point it out because I
think it is so beautiful and it just
continually been reaching for it we're
gonna pick up any new makeup geek and
you wanted some recommendations
check out unexpected the last makeup
product that I want to talk about is a
lip color this is from Tarte cosmetics
this is a little sample guy because I
got it in my most recent Sephora give me
some nude lip collection I do have a
giveaway going on for that with two
winners I'm not sure I know it's ending
very soon but I think maybe it's like
Tuesday so I will have that link down
below if you haven't entered yet so this
little guy it is one of their rainforest
like splash lipsticks color splash
lipsticks
it's from the rainforest of the sea line
this was in that set so it's a mini it
is in rum punch and i swatched
everything on my lips in that video
where I'm doing the giveaway and I'm
Elia was like oh my gosh this color and
then I worked for three days straight
for three days straight I wore rum punch
from Tarte cosmetics so this is what the
shade looks like it is absolutely
beautiful it is like that perfect nude
pink my lips but better completely
obsessed with it the shade is absolutely
gorgeous I have two full-size of these
lipsticks and there's some of my
absolute favorites they're very
long-lasting they feel very comfortable
on the lips though but if you like those
nudey pink shades you must check out rum
punch so that is everything for my
makeup and beauty at favorites I'm gonna
switch over to books now I only do have
two books in the month of August that I
gave five stars to if you want to hear
about some of the favorite books that I
read from the past month and then I
would recommend go ahead and keep
watching if this is where you want to
end then I thank you guys so much for
coming by and watching this video I do
appreciate it so much but the first book
that I want to talk about is girl
lasting and the author is Nina Lauren I
believe is how you
her name I will have links to my review
on my blog down below and then I will
also leave a link to Amazon in case you
were interested in picking the book up
for yourself I will say with this book
if you cannot handle disturbing
situations such as the child abuse and
sexual abuse and things like that then
do not read this book because it got
really really dark and really really
disturbing but you kind of know right
off the bat that that's going to happen
because we get introduced to the story
by finding a girl who's been held
captive for years and she's pregnant and
I believe she was 13 at the time that
she escaped and she's pregnant so you
know you know what's happening in the
book so that's kind of like the factor
right away that if you can't handle
those types of situations you need to
close the book and move on and now
you're getting her life a 13 years later
where she is now how she has handled
after you know being kidnapped and all
this abuse that she went through but
then comes the twist to the story
because now there is another missing
girl and I really don't want to give too
much away but she has somehow involved
with that missing girl as well and I
mean I think I said in my review that
this book made me sweat like I was
sweating while reading this book and not
just because I was reading it in August
and it was hot outside it is such an
intense thriller there is so many
interesting and intricate storylines
that go into one another that just
honestly blew my mind and when I got to
the end and everything clicked
mind blown mind blown I was like oh no
oh no that tin doc just happened I mean
I just I couldn't believe it
the writing was fantastic again if you
like thrillers I would recommend this if
thrillers are not your thing do not read
this because there is no part of the
story that lets up there is no part in
the story that I could sit back and be
like okay let's just see what's gonna go
on now every slide you are on the edge
of your seat through every single page
in here so girl last scene by Nina
Lauren that was a good one and then the
other one that I want to recommend is
hello sunshine and this is by Laura Dave
I really enjoy Laura Davis both I've
read from her in the past I would hi
recommend this author and also her
latest offering which is called hello
sunshine
this book was super intriguing to me
because I feel like our main character
sunshine is not supposed to be a likable
character she's made a lot of bad
decisions and she's pretty upfront about
that like she knows that she's not the
best person either but you can't help
but feel a connection with her and it's
interesting because a lot of who she has
built herself up to be is on social
media you know she's this person on
social media but not necessarily in real
life I felt like overall even though she
wasn't very likable all the way through
there was still parts that I found
relatable and I found that very
interesting
there's the talk about her YouTube
channel in here which I thought was
super fun so I do recommend this one
this one is much more lighthearted a
woman's fiction novel it's you know not
sort of anything like the other book I
just recommend it but it involves you
know her marriage her marriage falling
apart her YouTube career getting exposed
if you will say and I just thought it
was so interesting lauren dave is such a
solid writer she brings you in from the
very beginning and she keeps you hooked
until the very end and there's a lot of
different twists that get thrown at you
in this book there's a lot of family
dynamics in here that I thought were
very interesting as well and just
overall a completely solid read from
beginning to end
so that one is hello sunshine by Laura
