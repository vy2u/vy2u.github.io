today's video is going to be my make up
monthly for the month of February if you
are new to my make up monthly is it's
similar to a monthly favorites video
except I have different categories in my
make up monthly I talk about my
favorites I talked about the products
that failed me I also like to include
the fine category where I talk about
products that I have been trying out
that weren't necessarily a favorite oh
my gosh I absolutely love this product
but it also didn't completely fail me
and I think maybe it could work for
someone basically I just really like to
review products so I added that in there
so I could review some more products I
also do a channel shout-out in my makeup
monthly videos and then once we are all
done with makeup and beauty items I also
do book recommendations as I am a book
blogger and published author
so I chat about some of the books that
I've been reading this month that I
absolutely loved but if you are ready to
get into the makeup monthly for February
because holy crap that month went by
real quick well why don't we go ahead
and get started already so I'm gonna
kick it off with the products that
failed me this month the first one I
have here is from the ordinary this is
their hyaluronic acid I got this from
shop hush actually when they sent me a
package it like randomly had this this
hyaluronic acid in here from the
ordinary and I thought that was pretty
interesting I've been wanting to try out
the ordinary for a while I hear a lot of
incredibly mixed feedback about products
from the ordinary so I never really knew
what to think of it if I should buy it
myself I wasn't quite sure so when I saw
this coming here I was like I'm gonna go
ahead and give that a try it's six
dollars and 80 cents for the hyaluronic
acid and I'm a big fan of hyaluronic
acid I always have it in my skincare
routine because it's really good for
hydrating the skin I live in Iowa we are
having a really brutal winter and my
skin is definitely very dry at the
moment so I thought this would be great
I mean I used it quite a bit it's
probably up to here and you you know you
only need a few drops when I would put
it on in the morning but this really
irritated my skin I got a lot of those
really like nasty under the skin
breakouts when I was using this product
and I also really didn't notice a whole
lot happening
with my dry patches of when I was using
this and sometimes skincare can be a
little challenging because there are
certain products that you actually kind
of want your skin to break out from like
you want certain products to be kind of
pulling the impurities up from your skin
which does mean you are going to
breakout so you go through kind of like
a pouch for a while but then when you
continually use it it clears up your
skin so it skincare is something that I
really do try to give a really fair
chance to and use it for quite some time
but when I realized I was having some
bad breakouts I was like okay what what
is it that I've been you know putting
new in my skincare here and I realized
it was this so I stopped using it my
skin cleared up everything was looking
good I went back to using it and the
same thing happened so I was like okay
so it is this product that something
about it is not reacting well with my
skin I will be a 31 this month which is
crazy we're now in March it's almost my
birthday I'm very excited about it
I really do to the point where I still
don't care how old it is I'm turning I'm
still pretty pumped up about my birthday
I will be a 31 this month so I don't
have a like super youthful skin by any
means I do have dry skin right now and I
do have sensitive skin so those are kind
of my skin types and what I deal with
and for whatever reason this one from
the ordinary did not work out for me so
I will not be using that any further and
then I have two products here from ELF
who are just kind of a bummer the first
one here is one that I hear so many good
things about and so many people love
this foundation and it just did nothing
for me it's the elf a flawless finish a
foundation I had a friend send this to
me to try out I think I tried it in my
trying subscribers favorite makeup video
I mean so that tells you that a lot of
people really like this foundation and
I've tried it and I'm like why it
doesn't look good on my skin at all no
matter what primer I use underneath it
no matter what it is I'm doing with this
foundation it makes my skin look old
like that's the best word I can use to
describe how I look with this foundation
on I feel like it makes my skin look old
I feel like it's it's funny on my face
and it just is not flattering the first
time I used it I was like maybe my skin
is too dry so I've used like my most
hydrating primers with it I've used my
first solid rose gold oil with it and
that's like my secret ingredient if I'm
super dry
like using a really mattifying
full-coverage foundation I reach for my
rose gold oil because I was expensive
and I just I can't I can't get it to
work out beat up so bummed because so
much people like this foundation and
it's only six dollars and I want to love
it too but I it just it does not look
good on me at all I'm super bummed about
that and then the other product I have
here from ELF I just had a really weird
experience with this is an eyeshadow
pellet it's their nude rose gold palette
in this guy's ten dollars this one was
sent to me from ELF in PR and
unfortunately it actually caused my eyes
to have a weird reaction I think I
mentioned it in a YouTube video because
there was one day where I I filmed a
video and I basically had no eye makeup
on because my eyes were still recovering
and I talked about it on snapchat a bit
as well and I said that the only thing
like so I woke up one morning and my
eyes were so swollen my eyelids were
like red and puffy and it looked
horrible I wasn't sure if I had like
pink eye I didn't know if I was having
an allergic reaction to something I
didn't know what was going on and I was
trying to think I was like what did I
use yesterday my makeup routine like was
anything different and I had used this
palette so I was talking about it on
snapchat and people are saying you know
try the palette again and see if if it
happens again I'm like yeah it's gonna
take me a half second to do that because
my eyes were very painful but I did try
it again I just did like when I had a
few days off and I knew that I wasn't
going to where I had anything to do I
could just be lighter on my house I put
these shadows back on my eyes and the
same thing happened so I don't know what
it is about these elf eyeshadows that
cause my eyes to have such a reaction I
do have like fairly sensitive eyes like
sometimes glitter will bother me I can't
wear glitter from just any brand you
know things like that will bother me but
I've never I don't think I've ever had
such a strong reaction to an eyeshadow
before but I'm not gonna try it again
like I'm not gonna try it for a third
time because I don't want to put my eyes
through that and it's painful but the
palette is pretty and Wilson it's a
pretty palette and it's only ten dollars
but at the same time I feel like it kind
of performs like a ten dollar eyeshadow
palette like it wasn't necessarily
anything that blew me away
I thought when I did my makeup look with
this I was like I just want to
come in with a different palette or
coming with glitter or coming with
something but if you like you know more
neutral or you know everyday type of
looks I mean this is a nice choice for
ten dollars but if you have sensitive
eyes I don't know something about this
guy really bothered me and I'm trying to
think I don't feel like I've used elf
eyeshadows a ton but I did just buy a
new palette for them for an upcoming
video and now I'm a little bit nervous
well to see if the same thing happens
but has that happened to anybody else
with the Hellfire shadows have you ever
had a reaction like that I don't know it
was weird but unfortunately that
happened with this palette so I'm not
gonna be using this guy again ready so I
want to move over to the fine category
again these are products that I like but
I can't say that I love but maybe they
would work for somebody else out there I
have these eyeliners from the balm so I
got a PR package from the balm pretty
recently and it had like five different
of their mr. right eyeliners in here
I love eyeliners big fan of eyeliners
always wear eyeliners so it's really
excited to try them out and these are
just okay for me I believe they are
around seventeen dollars maybe seventeen
fifty these are what the eyeliners look
like these are a crayon eyeliner and
then you just twist them up when you
start to get down there I like that they
have a variety of different colors I
have the purple in my eye today I think
it's called blue plum I have a dark navy
one that I like to use and then this one
is kind of like a brown gold but they're
again they're just okay for me I don't
feel like they go on the waterline it's
super creamy or super pigmented
I kind of have to play around with them
for a while they're nice are kind of
smudging under the lash line and they're
I think they're fine but for eyeliners
like this I really like really creamy
pigments at once for my waterline
particularly and these are just okay I
think I said I like these guys and I
will continue to use them but I don't
think that I would repurchase them
myself I don't think they're an absolute
must-have eyeliner in your collection
but they're still decent they're not
terrible they're not not pigmented at
all they don't not go on my waterline or
anything like that but they're just
they're like mediocre eyeliners to me so
those are from the fall next up I have
an eyeshadow palette here this is from a
violet boss this is their one of their
new palettes it's called the hashtag
palette my friend Jill did send this to
me so big thank you to Jill we're
sending this to muted
out because I had been eyeing this
palette really really hard this is $45
okay so this palette I mentioned it and
I think it was my latest will I buy a
video I was talking about a new palette
from violet boss and I said spoiler
alert I was going to mention this one in
my makeup monthly in the fine section so
I also have the Holy Grail from violet
Voss and I really really enjoy that
eyeshadow palette I love the mattes in
there I think they're really beautiful
the shimmers not so much and with this
palette it is mostly shimmers but their
colors and shades that I love I have
purple on my eyes today I love wearing
purple so when I see this bottom row and
I see all these beautiful purples I get
really excited I also love gold on the
eyes got really excited I also love warm
tones got really excited for the fourth
row and then you have transitions I mean
I was like okay this is definitely a me
palette I love the mirror I love
traveling with the violet vos palettes
but I don't like the violet Voss
shimmers as much as I do the mattes and
because this one is mostly a shimmer
palette I just find myself not getting
as much use out of it as I was hoping
that I would the looks that I've created
with it I still ended up liking but I
feel like I have to really work to get
the looks I did and I look recently and
I think I have that one on Instagram if
I do I'll have a video down below link
down below in my Instagram I do a lot of
like mini tutorials over on my Instagram
and I used this shade down here this
really beautiful purple and I has you
work and work and build up and build up
and get my settings free outs get my
brush day up I was like oh my god I feel
like I was there forever the final look
was beautiful and I really enjoyed it
but man it just it took me a while to
get there so this one to me is just okay
and I've just noticed that I really do
enjoy the violet boss mats over the
shimmers when I go into my Holy Grail
palette I'm almost always creating an
all matte I look so unfortunately this
one was just an OK for me I still enjoy
the palette I will still reach for it I
will still use it but it didn't quite
knock it out of the park for me like the
Holy Grail one did from by Lafosse then
the final product that I have to mention
in the fine category is from a drunk
elephant I got a PR package from drunk
elf in a couple months back and you've
been seeing we talked about drunk
elephant products in these makeup
monthlies quite a bit I've had sales
I've had favorites I've had fines and I
have another fine this
which is okay drunk elephant is very
expensive because each time something is
in the favorite category all I hear is
and I'm like oh oh man but this one but
I think is okay this is the bestie
number 9 jelly cleanser okay so I feel
like I hear really good things about
this and this was one of those that I
honestly thought I was going to
absolutely love I prefer something like
this to remove my makeup versus like a
makeup remover I enjoy cleansing oils
cleansing balms things like that so I
was like this is gonna be the one that
definitely gets me so I think what I
don't love about this is the like
consistency of it I don't I don't like
the thick jelly boom to it it's just not
my thing
something that bothers me because when I
put it on my hands or I put it on like
my ship my she Sato facial cotton I feel
like when I put it on my face it's just
like Blunk big block there and I'm like
like I don't know I like to just I don't
know how to explain it but like I go in
and I remove my eye makeup first that's
typically what I do I put my remover
usually on my shoe Sato cotton pad and
then I rub them on my eyes but when I
use this and I put it on my eye it's
like I have a giant goop there and I'm
like oh no that is really disturbing so
I actually prefer to use this with my
hands because then I take my hands and I
rub them together a lot and then I'll
wash my face but I don't like stuff on
my hands I don't like makeup on my hands
I don't like watching makeup I don't
like removing makeup with my hands I
don't like any of it I want to use my
she Sato cotton rounds you know you know
they're great but with this I just don't
feel like I can because I just I just I
don't know I just feel like it's weird
and I also don't feel like it removes
makeup the best and I even had someone
comment I left a I did an Instagram
video using the drunk elephant makeup
and removing the makeup and someone said
it doesn't look like it removed your eye
makeup very well and it really doesn't I
have to kind of go in and very much take
my time removing my eye makeup when it
comes to this it's not you know one of
my other preferred makeup removers but
just as really quick and easy and it
takes everything off this one takes me a
little bit more time I will say that
this is $34 which is cheaper than I
thought it was going to be I really
expected it to be more in like the $40
range so $34 not the worst but I have
other
makeup removers that I prefer to this
and I feel like are easier to use and
just kind of more my style but then also
our better at removing makeup so this
one from drunk elephant it's pretty good
I'll use it all till it's gone but just
not a favorite of mine based on moving
over to at the favorite category like I
said I also do a channel shout out in
these makeup monthlies I've been doing
it for several months now and I love
doing it I love doing channel shoutouts
I left in collab videos I love my
YouTube friends and I just think it's
really fun to do how I choose the
channel shout out is the beauty blogger
or beauty influencer that I feature in
my beauty newsletter that I sent out
about once a month if you guys aren't
signed up for my newsletter like I said
I just sent it out once a month it's not
like overwhelmingly spam or anything
like that I have a link in my
description box down below I just have a
few more makeup reviews and their new
release news things like that I'll throw
in a giveaway in there for newsletter
recipients and things like that but I
also do have an interview with a beauty
influencer so I usually just ask about
for questions just have a short
interview and they're with someone well
if that sounds interesting to you and
something that you like make sure to
check the description box this month of
the interview and the future is with
Ashley clay T I just did a collab video
with her we posted it last week and it
was our tax refund wish list and we had
been talking for so long trying to
figure out what video we wanted to do I
actually got that idea from a subscriber
who left a comment on one of my past
videos and we decided to do it together
and thought it would be fun
she's a fellow Midwest girl and like I
said in our collab video she's so
positive and so happy I love watching
her videos and I love her personality
she just brings so much light into my
life when I get to watch her videos and
even if they're just short ones I just
feel better leaving her videos because
she's so positive she puts out a lot of
different videos she does a lot of
reviews and I think that if you guys
like my channel I think that you would
really like a sh lee's channel as well
so so if you're not yet subscribed
Ashley I suggest go over check her out
watch some of her videos let her know I
sent you I'll have her channel linked in
my description box down below of course
and then also I will have an interview
with her coming up in my newsletter
it'll probably go out in the next week
or so here I would say so he's still
time to sign up if you want to catch the
March newsletter that was going out oh
okay
so then moving on like I said it will
have some makeup and beauty favorites to
run through and then at the end I do
to book recommendations as well if
anyone is interested in that but my
first favorites that I want to talk
about for the month are these little
pallets from a hood of beauty I did not
think I was gonna like these did not
think I was no like these wasn't
interested in them I'm pretty sure I
didn't will I buy it on them and I was
like yeah nope not gonna get them not
interested and then I started seeing
reviews and everyone was like these are
amazing and I'm like crap hate when that
happens
so my sister-in-law Steph actually got
me this one for Christmas I sent her my
Sephora wishlist she drew my name him we
have on Mitch a side of the family he
has a brother and a sister and they both
have spouses except the six of us at
draw names and stuff true my name and so
I literally centered my Sephora loves
list here you go so she sent me this one
this one is called the smokey obsessions
palette love it love it love it
I love the silver in here I've got a
look with that and I thought it was
freaking gorgeous I love the shimmers in
here I love that we have mattes we can
create a full look what love the mirror
I love how small it is I'm all for it
and then my friend Kelly she has a
channel here que Bella Beauty I'll have
her channel link down below she actually
sent me this one this is the warm brown
obsessions and you love it my tones here
I am I'm here for this palette why did I
not want this palette stay up why did I
not want this palette I don't even know
I just did a look very recently on
Instagram with it so I'll have that
tutorial linked down below
and it's like one of my favorite looks
that I've done and I'm so happy that I
did it on a Friday night and I had plans
that night and I liked my lashes and I
liked everything about it and I was like
yes coz there's so many times that I do
a makeup look that I love and then I
film a video and wash my face and sit at
home with my dog and I'm like dang it
wish more people would have seen that
look but oh man I was so happy with it
so yeah these pounds I think they're
great I think the quality is great both
mattes and shimmers great so many looks
with these two palettes I love
all-inclusive palettes I'm someone who I
love reaching into one palette and
creating a full look that's one of my
favorite things to do and I can do that
both with each of these palettes so yeah
I love them I don't know why I was so
hesitant to buy them they are $27 but
you do get nine different shades and
thinking about it like
no that's a pretty good deal I actually
do want them all even the colorful
palette I would even do the colorful
palette because I feel like I could
create something fun with it but you
know I really do like this except I have
some highlight palettes these are from
mac cosmetics and oh my gracious I was
so shocked at how amazing these are and
how excited I got for these palettes so
they just released these to highlight
palettes they are 39 50 each which I do
think is pricey because you get three
highlights inside they are really huge
highlights don't get me wrong
they're very large pan sizes you do get
a mirror but it is 39 50 each you can
also find these available at Ulta but
wow these are amazing these were sent to
me in PR and from the moment that I open
them I just knew like I opened it and
was like yeah yeah no this is gonna be a
great palette I did do some swatches on
my Instagram soul insert that photo over
here but Wow
so there's two different palettes and
they don't have their names on them
which it drives me crazy
one is like flash in aw I think this
rose gold one it has rose gold print
right here and more of like these
lighter tones and the center one is a
really beautiful pinky color I think
this one is called flash and awe and I
think the one that has the gold
packaging and then more of the gold
tones in here I think this one is called
get it glowing but I'm like okay I'm
sorry but for 3950 you can't put the
names you can't no nothing no that kind
of drives me crazy
but these are really stunning highlights
these are like that wet highlight that I
loved so much the first time that I used
it I went with the rose gold palette and
I went with of this pinky shade because
I'm really into pink right now and pink
highlights I put that on and I was like
yep this palette is bomb
all I've used all three shades in here
and I've used all three shades in the
gold palette as well because I just them
so I'm just so attracted to this
highlight I love the finish that it
gives I love the glow that it gives if
you want a super blinding wet looking
highlight you would be really happy with
these Mac palettes I definitely think
you only need one of them I wouldn't
suggest going out and getting two and
honestly I was thinking about giving
this one away
but that's how much I love the formula
is that I
to do the selfish thing and keeping both
for myself that's when I know I really
love a product if I get an NPR and I
want to keep both because I love the
formula so much and that's what happened
with these so I'm sorry I did that but I
love them I love them both so much Pam
what tones you prefer I think that if
you love a beautiful blinding highlight
you would really like these ones from
Mac be moving on I'll just touch on this
one briefly because I did mention it in
a previous video not too long ago this
is from Pierre this is to get a grip i
primer I have had this on my list to put
in a favorites video for probably I'm
not kidding the last three months and
then I just keep having so many more
products and so many more products that
I'm like oh it's an eyeshadow primer
it's one of those overlooked makeup
products I did a video all about this
recently and mentioned this primer so I
kind of kept pushing it to the wayside
sounds like that's unsexy who cares
about an eyeshadow primer like talk
about palettes and things like that but
I had some space and this month's
make-up monthly and I did want to
mention it this is just a really solid
eye shadow primer I'll have my
overlooked makeup video down below but
like I said this is just incredibly like
a very tacky eyeshadow primer and I feel
like it's great for those really long
wear makeup days where you're getting
ready really early in the morning and
you know you need your makeup to last
all night I definitely suggest this one
I think it holds on to the eyeshadows so
well and I just really would recommend
it this is $20 from Pierre the
get-a-grip
I shadow primer I'm moving along I have
a brush to mention this is not a newer
brush to me but for whatever reason I
can't stop using it lately so when that
happens I want to tell you guys about it
this from a sigma beauty this is the 3d
HD max kabuki brush just love it it's
really big it has these different angles
on it because it's so big it's so quick
to apply the foundation but I also like
how it's angled because you can get
around your nose and between your
eyebrows things like that there was some
other brushes that could be a challenge
but again I just like how quick this is
this I believe is my most used a
foundation brush when I'm not using more
of like a sponge this is the number one
brush that I am going for I just
mentioned it recently when I was doing
my brand recommendation to my gift card
guide I did a sigma Beauty this is the
one this is one of the foundation
brushes that I recommend it just keep
using it lately I can't stop so what I
noticed that happening I put it on my
list to talk about in my makeup on place
so now I knew our product to me but one
that I just continually keep reaching
for already just to
left I did wanted to talk about these
lipsticks because wow they got me and
they got me right away these are the
soft matte liquid lipsticks from a
lawless beauty I wanted to keep one in
the packaging so you can see what it
looks like in the package here so really
beautiful packaging I did get a package
from loveless Beauty which was so
exciting to me I'm pretty sure I
mentioned them in the 8 brands I want to
try in 2018 but la this beauty has
really intrigued me when I started
seeing them pop up in YouTube videos I
spent one time where I probably research
for like 30 minutes or so on the brand
and Lawless who created the brand if you
guys have time I would recommend looking
it up I'm just seeing kind of what it's
about i I just thought it was really
cool and I was really inspired by her
story and by her in general I bought
this beauty on my list to try for quite
some time so to get an email from them I
was like so it's really happening
and they sent over three lipsticks I
have one still in my purse and they're
all named after men which i think is
funny this is Dane I believe this one is
Leo and then George is like my all-time
favorite and that guy's still in my
purse
so I've tried this out for the first
time in a like a first impression style
video or get ready with me video what's
the first time that I used it and I was
like wow I really like this lipstick
first of all it smells like candy which
I highly appreciate because I do love
candy so I like the way it smells it
applied so easily it says it's a soft
matte I don't necessarily would compare
it to the NYX soft matte lip cream it
has more of an O than that
but you can tell it's definitely soft on
the lips but it's extremely pigmented
when I applied it in that video I made a
comment I'm only having to dip into the
product once for my bottom lip and it
completely covered it normally I dip
back into a lip product at least two
times if not more to cover my bottom lip
and then I would do the same thing for
my top lip so very pigments that you're
not using a lot of product is what I
notice off the bat but these guys stay
the lasting power of these lipsticks
really impressed me especially
considering that it said that they were
soft matte and for some reason I don't
know to me I didn't know would they dry
down all the way they do what they last
long they do this even lasted me through
I wore gorge one night too we had like a
hibachi dinner date with some friends I
worked through that entire meal and the
drinks and everything
and my lip products still absolutely
fantastic I remember going to the
bathroom after dinner and looking in the
mirror and I was like I don't even need
to touch up I don't even you touch up my
lipstick that is impressive so I really
like these George's like my favorite
George was my favorite nude right now
but I also do really like Damon this is
more of a like a deeper burgundy color I
know I was wearing it and one of my
March Madness videos and I really did
like this color as well so I'm really
impressed with these lipsticks they are
$25 which says very expensive for a
lipstick but lawless beauty is coming
into Sephora I can see the page there it
says common soon which I'm really
excited about so I'm not sure I'm not
for sure which date exactly they'll be
released but I really like the story
behind the brand I like what the brand
represents and I do like their lipsticks
and I would recommend these at the
weekend after I first had tried these
outs I think I first I want to say I've
tried it out on like a Wednesday or
something like that but that following
weekend I went out Friday and Saturday
and wore George both nights that's how
much I love George George you got me so
yes the lawless liquid lipsticks highly
would recommend and then the last
favorite I have for the month is the
deuce or they do say pellet from a
dubious place this is one where I I
don't know if I expected to love this
palette so much because looking inside
of it I'm kind of like what what we do
what do I do with this palette but this
palette just gets me and when I am
reaching for my eyeshadow palette for
the day my mind continually keeps going
towards this palette I just really like
it the dubious plays palette I do feel
like are very good quality I feel like
they're very pigmented they're easy to
work with easily blendable and all of
that
sometimes the layouts and the color
selections can just you know with mine
on artistically creative mine I'm a
little like huh what am I doing here
but I really really like this palette I
love the pinks in here I love both of
these shimmers this is a really cool
purple I like that we have you know kind
of the more traditional colors in there
as well in case I want to go that route
this is a really cool color I love the
mint green I really really like this
palette my friend McLeish has sent this
to me and I was like thank you I wanted
this one so bad for whatever
and it was calling my attention yes it
intimidated me a little bit but I really
like this palette I feel like you can
create really beautiful like kind of
romantic looks this is the palette I use
in my recreating about this beauty
makeup tutorial I love the look that we
created in that video but yeah the the
pinks and like on these more like
romantic looks are kind of what I'm into
right now for whatever reason I don't
know why but this one is so good loving
this palette okay so that's gonna be it
for my makeup and beauty favorites if
this is where you are ending the video
thank you guys so much for watching I do
appreciate it I'll catch you guys in
tomorrow's video but if you do enjoy
reading or want some book
recommendations I have at two books that
I gave a five-star review to on my blog
and on Amazon in the month of February I
will have my blog listed down below I'll
have the links to these books on Amazon
and also the link to my review on a
chiclet plus if you are interested in
them but the first book I gave a
five-star review to is called one way
ticket this is by Kate O'Keefe e and
Melissa Baldwin I'm familiar with both
of these authors I really enjoy the
writing styles they write great Chiclets
and I was really excited to see them a
write a book together one way ticket is
so cute it's one of those books were
like maybe if you think too hard and
don't what's actually happening you
won't enjoy it but the writing is so fun
the characters are so fun but I just
kind of like forget about it and I just
got lost in the book so basically at
least two women meet each other at the
airport one is running away from her
wedding Rachel Greene style in her
wedding dress at the airport once coming
back from a friend's wedding kind of
feeling a little disgruntled with her
life she isn't quite where she wants to
be she moved for the love of her life
that didn't work out basically the women
who are both florists they decide they
are going to switch lives they're going
to limit each other's apartments they're
going to take over each other's floral
businesses and basically they just need
a break from their real life so they
they just swap life and I know like when
I was reading it I was like ah me is
that really gonna work out no it does it
does the writing is so enjoyable it's so
fast-paced it's so humorous but there's
also a lot of really cute lessons along
the way there's a great romantic angles
in there as well
and I really enjoyed the friendship that
happens between the two girls and their
chance meeting at the airport so that
sounds like a book that you would like I
would recommend a one-way ticket the
other one I gave five-star review
- is the complete opposite it's a
psychological thriller and whoa
this book was crazy this is called the
French girl and it is by alexei Eliot I
read on two very like different
different scales I like to read chiclet
romance laid-back funny books and then I
like thrillers and like psychological
suspense novels normal so in the French
girl our main character is Kate and Kate
is kind of unnecessarily being haunted
but she is seeing a girl who died when
her and her group of friends took a trip
ten years prior they met the French girl
while they were on this vacation and
after they left it was discovered that
the French girl had disappeared no one
could find her she was gone ten years
later her body has been found and now
the case is getting opened up again all
the friends are being questioned because
they were the last ones to see her alive
and they're trying to figure out what
happened to her and around this time
Kate starts seeing her but not like not
like a creepy way though like I mean
it's creepy if you're seeing a dead
person of course but like it wasn't that
sort of setting to the book where like
oh I'm being haunted she was just seeing
her but still so you're trying to figure
out as the friends are coming together
and you're hearing about them and you're
hearing about the last night that they
saw each other you're trying to figure
out okay who is it cuz clearly it has to
be one of the Front's right which one
was it and at one point I myself taking
notes on the little post-it next to my
desk like okay so this person saw that
and then this person so maybe it was
this and I was like I am taking notes
while reading yeah that's what I'm doing
I even put out a tweet about it that's
how impressed I was at this book so I
was trying to figure I was trying to
figure it all out too so I thought I was
I was so invested in it I was so engaged
in it I was trying to figure it out
along with it and the ending was quite
intense I won't give anything away of
course but the ending was very uh the
ending was very intense but I enjoyed it
if you enjoy psychological thrillers
suspense novels ones that are gonna make
you think and you don't mind a little
bit like there was never anything overly
gruesome in this book but you know if
you don't mind reading about an
uncomfortable topic such as murder I
would definitely recommend the French
girl because it had me it had me from
like page one I'm telling you so the
French girl by Lexie Eliot they'll also
be listed down below but then other than
that
that's going to do it for my makeup
monthly for the month of February so
that is everything a for my makeup
monthly in February that month I mean
obviously February a short month but man
that month flew by but I love March it's
