today's video is going to be my make up
monthly for the month of March if you
are new to my make up monthly that's
similar to like a monthly favorites
video or monthly favorites and fails but
I actually have a three main categories
that I talk about I do talk about my
favorites I talk about my fails and I
also do have a fine category where I
talk about some of the products that
were just okay for me maybe they would
work well for someone else but I just
want to be able to categorize them as an
absolute favorite I love this product so
much so it's just like one big long
review video I also do a channel
shout-out in my makeup monthlies and I
also am if you do not know I might
publish out there and book bloggers so
after we get finished talking about
makeup and beauty I actually do touch on
the books that I gave a five-star review
to on my book blog throughout the month
and I do have four titles this month
actually it was pretty good reading
month for me so if you're interested in
books at all anyone want some reading
recommendations I give those at the end
of the video but I always have a lot to
chat about and I'm already losing my
voice so that's perfect but when we go
ahead and get started I feel like I've
been sick for ever but it's like in my
throat now a lot so I keep losing my
voice and it's really fun but to start
off I am going to start off in the fail
category I have quite a few fails this
month which is a bummer this one I did
review fairly recently so I'll just
touch on it quickly this is from milk
makeup this is the luminous blur stick
yeah luminous blur stick so milk makeup
came out with the original blur stick
and a lot of people really enjoyed it
myself being one of them they came out
with this luminous blur stick and
unfortunately for me it was just a huge
miss I use this in a first impression
video so I did review it in my first
impression follow up fairly recently and
I said it just really wasn't for me it
just doesn't do anything flattering for
my skin and no matter what foundation I
was putting over it nothing it would
just want to sit right it made my face
kind of like slick and just like kind of
shiny and weird-looking and not in like
a luminous glow a nice way a big thank
you to milk makeup for sending this to
me to be able to try out I wish that I
would have enjoyed it I thought that I
would with how much I enjoy the blur
stick and I do like looking luminous but
being unfortunately that one missed the
mark for me
next up here
have a setting spray this is from
covergirl it's the look lock up all day
setting mist covergirl is coming out
with a bunch of new releases lately I've
been really lucky to get a few packages
from them and when I saw this setting
spray I like setting sprays I use them
quite a bit I think they're a cool thing
and I want to say I used this in like a
first impression video as well and I was
like oh no what just happened I don't
know if you would be able to see the
mist on camera but it's like oh I just
boom right in your face in it oh the
first time I sprayed it I look watches
happen we're just happen to my face it
is a very intense spray and it leaves
like the water droplets on your face it
can really mess up your makeup and
that's quite an intense fragrance to it
that I don't love because it's not like
a it's not like a nice fragrance it's
just it's just intense but this this
prayer on this guy it's just whoop right
in your face and it's that nope that's a
little much for me it doesn't do
anything good for my makeup so this one
is a no-go for me this is about 1199 and
there are definitely better setting
sprays on the market oh boy this next
one it was an interesting one this is
the Revlon Photoready insta filter or
foundation okay then so I got this in PR
as well I think all of my fails came for
me in PR which you know I'm so grateful
to get PR I'm so excited when I do but
it definitely doesn't mean that I'm
always gonna love everything and you
know what I I think PR is a good things
like and I can tell people what I think
about some of these products and maybe
save you some money or maybe convince
you to spend money I don't know what do
you want to do but this one this this
little guy this is like an $18
foundation from the drugstore which is a
super pricey so right off the bat that's
pretty crazy the applicator is very
interesting so this is what it looks
like and you actually twist it up from
the bottom and then it'll come out and
you can use it to apply you can use it
to blend in I don't really love the
sponge to blend it in it just kind of a
it felt weird I thought it gives kind of
streaky so usually after I like start to
dab it in I'll grab a brush or a Beauty
Blender and buff it in the rest of the
way this foundation
oxidize on me I mean I'm not kidding
like six shades darker if you guys
caught my videos that I did when Georgia
Harris was down here she it we talked
about this foundation a lot because the
first night that we met I made a comment
about like I'm not sure I really like
this foundation it's my I think it's my
second time trying it and we were out at
the Olive Garden and I was like I'm just
not really sure how confident I am with
this foundation and she was like I'm
glad you said that because it looks
crazy on you and I was like why what
happened I hadn't looked at myself in
the mirror for probably like five hours
I got done filming and started working I
looked up and I was like oh my gosh I
gotta go I gotta go make Georgia and AB
when I finally I pulled out my mirror
and looked at it I was like whoa and
then the next day when we were getting
ready I used a foundation that doesn't
oxidize on me and we were at dinner that
night and she's like it's just so funny
you look like a completely different
person from last night yeah okay so whoa
um I was trying out the shade 220 and
natural beige but it's out of it it's
just bizarre how dark it turns me but it
also doesn't do a lot of nice things to
the skin like the same as I was saying
with the milk makeup Blair stick it
doesn't really do anything flattering
for me I again feel that with this I do
have drier skin and I feel like it
really cleans - all the dry patches so
that's not very cute and I don't know
you know I just turned 31 so I don't
have the youngest skin in the world and
I feel like maybe with more mature skin
I don't think that this foundation
necessarily looks great on it so in
combination of it just like not sitting
well on the skin clinic cleaning - dry
patches and then oxidizing and extrema I
have never had a foundation make me that
dark before never so this one is a big
ol no-go for me out I will not be using
the Revlon foundation anymore that was
crazy and for $18 like I really wanted
to love it I really did but that was a
no the next item I have here oh man I'm
so bummed about this because I was so
excited this is from Kevin naquan one of
my favorite brands I love this friend so
much it's the prison magic highlighting
a trio I got this in the mail and I was
like all this looks so cool I love Kevin
Kwan and
and Ally I opened it up and I was like
mmm I am NOT a hundred percent about
these highlights like they just they
immediately just looked interesting to
me say that you can use these for face
eyes or lips so I do want to say that
you can kind of do whatever it is that
you want to do with these but I used the
first one as a highlight and I was like
oh no it's just glitter
it's just glitter here's what the
swatches will look like this one does
swatch pretty good but it's also
extremely extremely chunky but so you
can see they have like these holographic
shifts to it but when you blend it out
it really is it's a lot of glitter and
it's a lot of just it just doesn't do
much I mean I feel like it definitely
swatches better on my fingers than it
actually looks on my skin because you
see how it has that purple iridescent
that's not what it looks like on my skin
it looks like little flecks of glitter
with maybe a highlight it just it it
doesn't look good it doesn't look good
at all I used this one right here and
kind of dabbed it on the ice just to see
it's better that way it's better that
way so if you are really into a
holographic trend I would get this more
for your eyes than for your face but it
just really didn't look the best on me I
didn't like how much glitter was in it
and then it just kind of all falls off
your face and there's really nothing
there the first time I used it I was
getting ready to film and I was like I
have my highlight like this just looks
weird on my face I look like I have
flecks of glitter all over me so I kind
of had to do my best to clean it up and
then put an actual highlight on so
that's what I wanted to try it on my
eyes since it is good for that I'm not
someone who really puts powder on my
lips or does holographic things with my
lips so I didn't try it that way and you
know maybe if that's something that you
need but there's probably other you know
powders or highlights or shadows even
that you could use if you do want that
effect and this is $48 but man I'm still
bummed that this was a Miss for me
because I really really do like this
brand and I like so many items from them
but unfortunately this one just did not
look good and then the very last item I
almost forgot that I have because I
don't have them anymore I don't know if
I love these in Georgia so hotel room I
might have one she was down here
visiting me but I'll put a picture on
the screen it's from Pacifica and these
are like makeup remover away
and it's from I think one of their newer
lines there's these pineapple wipes I'll
have everything that linked down below I
linked out everything whether it's a
fail for me or favorite for me I linked
my makeup and all of that stuff in the
description box you can always check
there but these wipes they smell really
good I don't even like pineapple but I
do like the smell of pineapple and they
smell really good they're very heavily
fragrant 'add but they don't do anything
they don't take anything off they've
really just gonna like smear like I was
using it to remove swatches one day and
it really was just like smearing things
on my hand and then I put them in my
purse for when I was visiting Georgia
and even she used them and she was like
what are these these do absolutely
nothing I was like I have no idea so as
an actual makeup remover wipe I
definitely would not recommend if you
don't like cents you would hate that
especially I would never put something
that scented close to my eyes because I
do have sensitive eyes so I would not
really recommend it at all for taking
your makeup off but even if you're
someone who you'd like to have makeup
remover wipes handy for swatches it's
driving me crazy the swatches on my
finger I would not recommend that either
because it really just made more of a
mess than anything so unfortunately the
Pacifica pineapple makeup remover wipes
were a Miss for me as well so a lot of
fails this month that hurts I'm gonna
move over to the fine category talk
about some products that I thought were
pretty decent not a favorite maybe some
of you might enjoy them I just like to
review products I did also want to show
you I went to wipe off the Kevin Daquan
swatches and if you can see from my
fingers I don't know if you'll be able
to see the best if you can just see that
like fine glitter all over my hands
that's what this looks like on my face
when I try to use it as a highlighter so
I thought I would show you guys that cuz
I feel like it's a product that swatch
is better than it performs on because I
got pretty hyped over the swatches but
now I just feel like I'm full of glitter
so that's great okay so the first item
that I want to talk about are these luxe
lipsticks from colour-pop these confuse
patient I'm not gonna lie I've talked
about them a little bit in the past
night warn him in some videos I have
three shades here I actually had a
beauty blogger Babis Beauty send me a
really sweet package which was so
awesome and she sent at some of these
color pop lipsticks so I could try them
out which made me super happy because I
know a lot of people have been very
curious about these I'm sure a lot of
you guys probably bought them if you
were
about them because they're only like
seven dollars which is nice and
affordable of course but I can't quite
figure these out because I have three
different shades and they seem to
perform differently so I have a hard
time getting a good handle on them so I
have the shades still crazy which this
is the first a lipstick that I wore it's
a really nice kind of like rosy nude
pink out so I don't know and I really
like it I like the way to apply it it
applied very creamy but these are
supposed to be a matte lipstick and it
didn't apply like in matte lipstick
which I enjoyed because I don't
necessarily love for like a really tough
matte lipstick but then it also never
looked matte on my lips it continually
looked creamy just like it applied I
could rub my lips together just fine and
I was like okay maybe I got it wrong and
these aren't matte lipsticks and then I
tried out the shade humble pie and even
it was a little bit more difficult
putting it on than the other one but
still not bad and there's a shade of
humble pie wasn't too many putting it on
and it looked creamy but it definitely
got matte I could tell that I was mad on
my lips it was harder to rub my lips
together but it also looked very dry
like my lips kind of suffer right now
what the dry season is apparently spring
but no one's apparent until i OA that
it's spring yet and it just didn't look
great and I was like okay so that looks
different than the other one and then I
also have the shade money side up and
this one is it's like a cross between
the two it's not as creamy as the first
one it's not as mad as the second one
it's like in-between and I'm like what
are these I'm confused
so do you guys have these lipsticks what
is your finish how does it apply for you
do you find discrepancies between
different colors because for me it's
really hard as a reviewer to review a
product that is so different amongst the
different shades I don't really know
what to do I don't know what to tell you
I don't know if this is a matte lipstick
I don't know if it's a creamy lipstick I
don't know what this is supposed to be
so I don't dislike the lipsticks except
for the one that is pretty darn matte
humble pie I don't feel like it looks
very flattering on the lips it's just
too it's just too matte
like not and unlike a liquid lipstick
Matt kind of way it's just like in a bad
kind of way so this one I don't enjoy
but these two I like especially still
crazy because of how creamy it is but I
don't know I just I wanted to be able to
review with the colour-pop lipsticks and
let you know what I think about them but
it's also really hard to review them
because all three shades that I have
perform differently so I think that's
very weird these are nice and affordable
I like the packaging they have a really
big color selection which is great you
just kind of might go into it as a
gamble I don't really don't what to tell
you so I would love to know especially
if you guys have the three colors that I
have and what do you think do you have
the same experience that I did I don't
know I was just a little bit baffled
about these so next up I want to talk
about these I show the pallets from
wet-and-wild I know but these have been
out for a while and everybody has
reviewed them and no comparisons on them
and everything is I don't even know
people care about these anymore but am I
really a sweet a friend at Lisa Stevens
actually sent these to me which I was a
so excited about a big thank you to Lisa
for that package I will have her channel
link down below I talked about these all
the time but for some reason you haven't
checked her out yet you should you
should go send her some love she needs
it right now we love you Lisa but she
did some of these a lot to me so I've
been trying them out and I was pretty
excited about these because I do like
the wet and wild eyes shadows one of
their like little trios and silent
treatment that was like one of my first
like re shuttle pilots when I was
starting youtube and I was like super
excited over it I think I did like a
smokey eye tutorial on YouTube or
something home that's probably
embarrassing to watch but so they kind
of like revamped and they came out these
10 pan pallets and they're $4.99 like
five dollars for these I think that's
amazing so I have not a basic peach Newt
Awakening and then rose' in the air and
I know a lot of people are really
excited over Rosie in the air because it
was supposed to be like a modern
renaissance do for me I think that these
are okay I mean for five dollars I don't
think that you can go wrong I don't
think you're going to be wasting your
money if you purchase these if I had
purchased these myself for the five
dollars I would be very happy I mean but
I can't say that these are a favorite I
can't say that these are an absolute
standout I can't say when I'm looking at
my eyeshadow palettes and deciding what
palette I'm gonna wear for that day that
I'm like ooh that one well is really
speaking to me you're decently pigmented
but nothing
really like blows me away I think this
one was actually the first one that I
tried and I was like okay that was
alright and then I actually tried I
think it was this one not a basic peach
and this one I didn't feel like was as
good as the first one and especially the
blue in there I was really excited about
and you could barely see the blue no
matter what I was doing the settings
breeze I was using oh man it just really
did show up at all and I was like me and
that was the color like I was super
excited about in here and it just didn't
really do much so this one I I didn't
feel like as was as good as the other
one and then the Newt awakening I feel
like this is kind of like my type of
eyeshadow palette very nude and neutrals
and all of that fun stuff
but again the shimmers in here were just
really really hard to work with and you
just really have to take your time
building them up I feel like they can be
a nice base especially if you're gonna
use like a glitter a lot of times when
I've been reaching for these palettes I
would find myself topping it with a
glitter just to give some sort of oomph
these could be really nice if you I get
asked a lot of questions like what kind
of makeup should I wear to the office
you know I'm somewhere where I can't
wear work somewhere where I can't wear
wild makeup or things like that
I think these palettes would be a really
good choice for you especially this one
for beginner and makeup these could be a
good choice for you you know things like
that but for me and for like my quality
of eyeshadow palettes that I prefer
they're just not my absolute favorite
but they're not a mist they're not a
fail they still work nice you just kind
of have to take your time with them and
build shadows up and all of that fun
stuff but again for five dollars I mean
I honestly don't think that you can go
wrong already to finish off the affine
category I have a two skincare products
that right about here I have this one
from pixie in their skin treats
collection this is the Rose caviar
essence it says it's a moisture serum so
I did get this sent to me in PR as well
and a lot of people asked will you
review this essence and I was like of
course I will I love trying out skincare
so it says that it's supposed to it's a
serum essence to melt into the skin and
delivering fresh botanicals to hydrate
and restore a brightness so this for all
skin types and this I just don't feel
like did anything and I feel like
sometimes skincare is hard to review
because I feel like your skin just knows
when something is
working for you when something is not
working for you when something is
fabulous for your skin I feel like your
skin knows and it's kind of hard to
explain that to another person but as I
was using this I was like I just don't
feel anything like I didn't feel like it
was really doing anything for my skin I
didn't see a lot of brightening going on
but it wasn't bad for my skin it did
break me out it didn't like clog my
pores or anything like that it does
smell really nice and I mean like it
feels okay on the skin as well but it
was just nothing that like overly
excited me and again I didn't see
anything from using it and I used it
consistently in the morning after I
would cleanse my face I would put this
on I use it consistently for about two
to three weeks or so and then I stopped
using it and my skin was fine like it
wasn't like calling for me to start
using the essence again so it's just
okay for me but also it's $24 which
sounds very expensive pixie is a
drugstore brand but they get into those
higher price points and I don't think
that I could recommend it for twenty
four dollars
again it's not a fail it didn't do
anything bad for my skin but at the same
time it did do anything good and I think
that that's pretty overpriced and
there's better things on the market so
this one was very just okay but next up
I have a item here from a Korres this is
the wild rose a smoothie brightening
priming moisturizer okay so I got this
one sent to me from a PR company not
necessarily from Korres themselves cuz
it's a brightening moisturizer and I
actually agree I think that you can see
a difference in brightening when you do
use this especially if you use it
consistently which I was doing for a
while $45 on the Sephora website and
this is another one that I think it's
okay I like that it does what it says
it's gonna do I like that you can see
results when using it but it's not a
moisturizer that's like absolutely
knocked my socks off if I didn't have it
in my collection I would be like no I
need to repurchase it right away but I
thought that it was pretty decent at
what it does if this is something that
interested in the ingredients interest
to you the brightening effect interests
you it's a nice lightweight moisturizer
it has a nice scent to it but nothing
too overpowering nothing too
overwhelming but you know it is $45 for
moisturizer which can you know start to
get up there in price but I think that
it was pretty good just nothing that was
an absolute favorite of mine but I liked
it I'll continue using it until it's
gone but just not an apps
favorite and then I actually do have one
more item in the fine category as well
these are new from morphe and these are
their gel liners so I got these
intimated in PR which I was really
excited for I feel like gel liners are
kind of like making a comeback I'm
seeing more and more brands kind of put
out these gel liners and I used to be a
big big fan of gel or cream liners it
was like all that I wore for the longest
time and now I prefer more of like a pen
style liquid liner but I was like you
know why I'll go ahead and give these a
try I tried out stargazer first which I
was really interesting to me I really
went to town on this liner I don't know
if you'd be able to tell on camera but
it's black but it has sparkle in it like
like very fine flecks of like silver
glitter and I was like although it's
just kind of cool they have some glitter
in my liner I think that that's pretty
neat you know the glitter doesn't show
up at all it's just black so let's just
i'll just throw that it right out there
if you are interested in this because
you think it's a glitter liner it's not
actually a glitter liner but as an
eyeliner i thought that it looked pretty
nice it's not the blackest liner by far
that i have used and i don't know if
that was because of the glitter that was
in there i'm not really sure but it was
a fine liner and it was very smooth it
applied very easily and I was like okay
perfect like you know probably not gonna
be a favorite of mine and I'm really
disappointed about the glitter but it
went on pretty well these are nine
dollars if you're interested in getting
them I think they're only available on
the morphe site but i think about the
morphe liners and that's everything in
the fine category right so I'm gonna
switch over to my favorites before I
jump into makeup and beauty and then
finish it off with books I'd like to do
a channel shout-out in my make up
monthly every month I love being able to
work with other youtubers I love doing
collab videos I love recommending my
friends it's just one of my favorite
things to do so I've been including a
channel shout-out in my makeup bump late
for I'm gonna say the past six months
maybe I feel like it's been a file and
how I choose how to do my channel shout
out is that I actually send out a beauty
newsletter once a month where I give
some further reviews in there I talk
about new and upcoming releases things
like that and then I also do have a
beauty bloggers feature in there as well
with a short Q&amp;amp;A with a fellow beauty
blogger and then that is who I mentioned
in my channel shout out video to the
feature for the month of April is LS she
is somewhat of a newer channel to me I
mean within the past couple months here
or so but
once I started watching her videos I
just got completely sucked in I just
loved her personality I loved her makeup
vibes she's someone who definitely has a
different style than me like a makeup
style she is so good at creating really
cool colorful but like ng unique I mean
like sometimes she goes editorial like
the looks that she comes up with is just
as inspiring to me so much I just love
watching her channel but she's got a lot
of really great chatty videos as well
and she's someone who I like watching
her channels because I feel like she
makes me kind of like stop and think
about things you know it within the
beauty community within the beauty
industry and I just think that she's
she's such a fun person to watch I would
highly recommend her channel I watch all
of her videos and I feel like I walk
away of watching one of her videos
either learning something or thinking
about something or just being inspired
to play with makeup and I love that she
really has she had really has no
boundaries when it comes to makeup
she'll just go ahead and push the limit
to whatever it is that she wants to do
and she's just kind of like
unapologetically herself and I think
that's just amazing
and I love watching that on YouTube so I
highly recommend
Elle's channel if you want to catch an
interview with her in my newsletter that
link will be down below I will have
Ella's channel linked down below as well
if you are not yet subscribed to her I
definitely think that you should be and
then I'm gonna go ahead and switch over
and talk about some of my Beauty
favorites for the month so the first two
I'll just touch on briefly because I did
also review them in my first impression
follow-up video but when I like really
loved something I also want to make sure
like I know not everybody watches every
single video so if sometimes you see
repeated items it's because I do
understand that and with the makeup
monthly is like if that's the only video
of mine you watch I want to make sure
that I mentioning the products that I
really do feel strongly about first one
here are these liquid lipsticks from
Pixie these are their matte last at
liquid lipsticks and these are Bob
liquid lipsticks these are so good I
love the applicator on these these are
really smooth to apply to the lips they
come to a nice pointed tip so you can
easily line your lips the colors in the
line are so very beautiful
the one that I wear the most is pastel
puddle it's a really nice kind of a
deeper nude pink I would say they smell
nice as well but they last a really long
time and I just think they're fabulous
at liquid lipsticks I've been very
impressed with these and I've been
seeing them pop up
more and more more people are talking
about these and it's for a good reason
they're about $15 again they're on the
higher price point for a drugstore
brands is there something different we
can call pixie cuz I don't feel like
they're drugstore but these are really
good I would recommend them and then the
other one is the Smashbox a photo finish
primer Iser I got a minute for $15 and
if you can tell like I'm I'm doing
pretty good on my mini I love this
primer this primer makes so many
foundations look so good on my skin the
only foundation that has not looked good
with this primer is that Revlon and it's
because it's just a fit overall okay but
this is a balm primer it has hyaluronic
acid in it it makes you look really
hydrated and just makes your skin look
so good especially if I'm doing like a
full coverage foundation or a really
mattifying foundation I'll put this on
and it looks beautiful so I've been
talking about this one and raving about
this a lot but for a good reason it's
pretty bomb so moving on I have a blush
here I bought this one because I was
hearing so many people rave about this
blush and I was like I want to get it
and then I went to my new Ulta
I got a half off coupon and I thought
score I not purchased the flower Beauty
blush this is called their flowerpots
powder blush and I got mine in the shade
at Peach Primrose another like I feel
like I even heard about this shade a lot
so it's a super pretty blush with kind
of that flower imprint in there but dang
this is a nice blush it is $10 which is
a little bit pricey again I got mine for
5 and I feel like I'm winning there this
is super pigmented like I need a very
very light hand going into this blush
and it creates a beautiful peachy sheen
onto the cheeks I have a feeling I'm
going to especially love this blush in
the springtime but I mean I feel like
it's fantastic I know why everybody was
talking about it I have no regrets
purchasing this blush and I just think
it's great so if you're looking for a
really solid blush I definitely
recommend the one from flower beauty I
do some skincare to chat about as well
this is what I've been using as a
sleeping mask on a very consistent basis
this is from a patch ology it's the
restoring night a cloud mask so this is
$40 you can find it at Ulta I also do
have a discount code of Pathology if you
would use their website not a sponsored
video um but I really I really enjoy
this mask if you can see I'm just
like scraping on the sides there this is
one of those skincare products like what
I was talking about earlier that you can
feel it working on your skin it does
have retinol in it which is good for
anti-aging any girl just turn 31 it also
has hyaluronic acid great for hydration
so that's really awesome but it's
something that when you put it on your
skin you do feel it tingling and it's a
sleeping mask I put this on before bed
and it just I'm like yes it's working
cuz it's a weightless whipped mask and I
do agree it just it feels it feels very
lightweight and it feels like hydrating
but it's not not like greasy at the same
time so it just feels really good and
using it pretty consistently for quite
some time and I really enjoy it as a
sleeping cream so that one is from
pathology and then my last pretty
favorites to talk about these are from
the balm these are their new take home
the bronze bronzers so they came out
with the three new bronzers they have
three different shades in here and I
actually use them for a variety of
different reasons I have this one in
Oscar which I use as a contour shade and
is what I have as my contour shade today
and then also tawny is what I use as my
bronzer and I do have it as my bronzer
shade on today they do also have graham
II which is too dark for my skin tone
but I do think it's really nice that
they have different options are 17:50 a
piece I like the packaging on it the
balm has such cute packaging and I also
do like that it has little mirrors in it
as well yes I think they are really good
I have them on today I find myself
reaching for them quite a bit they are
really easy to blend out they're really
nice and pigmented especially the ones
that I use as the bronzer Tony I need a
very light hand with that one but
luckily it's really easy to blend out as
well and yeah I would just highly
recommend these I'm from the balm and
then after that that's gonna do it for
my makeup and beauty favorites if this
is where you guys are ending the video I
thank you so much for watching I
appreciate it so much I do want to say
that definitely another favorite of mine
without making this video too too long
is all of you guys and all of your
support the day that I'm filming is at
the day that I hit 50,000 subscribers on
YouTube which is so crazy it was a
really exciting moment that's what a big
number and that's gonna bring never in
my mind so it was really cool to see
that the past couple months here have
been have been very
challenging and interesting I went
through some rough times in my personal
life for some things I shared publicly
some things I chose not to share
publicly and it's just been kind of like
it's just been kind of difficult and to
have such a wonderful community behind
me and so many new friends that I've
made I just feel so entirely grateful so
thank you guys so much you're definitely
a big favorite of mine as well okay I
get emotional in like every video why is
this do anyways I just sort of say thank
you guys for watching this video but if
you do also want to get some book
recommendations if you need some reading
recommendations I'll go ahead and jump
into the four books that I gave a
five-star review to I of course will
have my book blog linked it down below
as well it's chiclet plus com I usually
do about two or so book reviews a week
over there so I'll have that one list it
down below and for each book I will have
my book review and then I will also put
on the Amazon link as well first one
that I want to talk about is called
skipping out on Henry and this is by CL
Ogilvie I'm not a hundred percent I'm
saying that correctly this is a chiclet
book we follow two friends at Tabitha
and Posey and it has some of my favorite
elements its Chiclets which is like
women's fiction but light-hearted and
humorous but it also has time travel in
it and I was like yes I love kind of
like magical realism twists and books
where like you know something
extraordinary is happening and it
probably can't happen in real life but
it somehow works out in real life in the
book I love it
so they actually time travel all the way
back to when Henry the eighth was king
they get into all kinds of trouble who
is the Henry the eighth I was laughing
throughout the book I love the time
travel aspect to it I love the French of
aspect - I love friendship fiction
that's actually what I typically write
is friendship fiction and the dynamic
between the two girls was so much fun to
read but if you need a good laugh if you
also enjoyed anything like time trouble
or chiclet I would highly recommend
skipping out on Henry the next two
titles I have are pretty different in my
Q&amp;amp;A someone asked what are my favorite
genres to read and I said Chiclets and
then I said thriller slash suspense I
have two very different spectrums that I
enjoy reading but the next one is called
the broken girls by Simone st. James
this is a ghost story that scare
me there was a night that I was home
alone reading this and I was like
someone there like this is kind of
spooky you kind of get to at different
time frames in here and it's all kind of
focusing on an abandoned girls boarding
school from like the 1950s and you know
I'm already creeped out saying those
terms but we get the girls in the 1950s
who went to the boarding school and then
we also get present tense where the
school has now been abandoned but
someone has bought it and they're trying
to fix it up but they are finding all
kinds of spooky things in there there's
a ghost in there there's there's some
interesting police work at play here and
it's just a fantastic story I don't want
to give too much away with this one
because there's a lot of interesting
twists and turns throughout the way at
the ending pretty much like very much
surprised me but I will say that it's
spooky
the ghost part of the story definitely
kind of like gave me the creeps if
they're out the way but it's a really
good story there's a lot of history in
this book as well but I thought was it
was it was difficult to read a lot to do
but like the Holocaust all around a
fantastic book that left me
Burtie is aired and then the other one
that I have is more more on the thriller
side this is called look for me by Lisa
Gardner and this one was more how would
I say it was more graphic than some
novels that I tend to prefer I do like
thriller and I do like suspense but I
don't like really overly graphic books
are like gory books or anything like
that my camera actually died while I was
talking not just overheated it died so I
know I've been talking for a very long
time so I'm not sure where I left off
but it didn't deter me too much if I was
talking about the kind of graphic
violence in there because it wasn't it
wasn't too overwhelming it wasn't
totally throughout but I did want to
point out if that's not something that
you enjoy you wouldn't like this novel
either but it's about basically a family
an entire family that gets murdered in
their own home except for the teenage
daughter but the teenage daughter is
missing
it's being questioned if she murdered
her entire family and then there's a lot
more that comes into play and we get a
lot of different point of views from the
detective on the case and then also from
the girl who
is on the run and it's just very
interesting how everything comes
together it was a very powerful story
about family but it was very very sad
when the ending came about I cried for
quite some time because it just was a
really heartbreaking story it was hard
to read but it was a really really good
book at the same time it was fantastic
writing it kept me on the edge of my
seat was very much in the mystery aspect
the entire time so really good book you
know definitely just some hardware
scenes to get through so that was a look
for me and then the last one that I have
is called the big job and this is by
Libby Kirsch it's gonna be kinda
difficult to talk about this one because
it is a part of a series and is this the
third or fourth book in the series it's
quite the quite a ways down in the
series I have read the entire series as
the Stella Reynolds mystery series it's
very much more of a lighthearted mystery
than the book that I was just talking
about hello Reynolds is actually a TV
reporter but at the same time she kind
of does her own investigating on the
side and kind of gets wrapped up in some
mysteries again much more lighthearted
much more scaled back than the book that
I was talking about previously but I
love the series I think it's so much fun
I also I really enjoy mystery novels as
well I would love to write one one day I
mentioned that in my Q&amp;amp;A as well and
then would I recommend the big job but I
think that even though you can read it
as a standalone I would just suggested
the mystery series as a whole so it's
the Stella Reynolds mystery series again
I'll have everything linked down below
so that's the final book that I want to
chat about before I'm a makeup monthly
and then after that that's gonna do it
for my March makeup monthly your guy's
eyes gonna be everything before today's
video I hope you enjoyed it seeing as
some of my favorites my fails the
products that I thought was just okay

recommendation I know I always put a lot
into these videos but I like to do this
one big monthly wrap-up and I enjoy
making these even though my camera
usually dies while I'm making these
videos but if you guys didn't enjoy
