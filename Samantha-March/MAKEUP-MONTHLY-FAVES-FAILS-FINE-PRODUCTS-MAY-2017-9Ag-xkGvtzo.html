today's video is going to be my makeup
monthly for the month of May man am I
excited to be out of the month of May
I'm filming this on June 1st and you
don't even know how happy I was to fill
that calendar I feel like May was just
like such a disastrous month for me from
I mean what Sarah is also seeing my
wisdom teeth removed and having a
horrible experience with that and then
just so many icky things were happening
in the month of May and so I'm like you
know what I'm excited new month June is
here warm weather is here like let's
just get it rolling but I post my makeup
on plays each month at the end of the
month beginning of a new month it
basically has replaced my monthly
favorites because instead of just going
over my favorites or even incorporating
a few fails I have decided to talk about
my favorites my fails and then the
products that I thought were fine
because you guys know that I love
talking about makeup I really love
reviewing makeup that's mostly what my
channel is focused on and I thought it
would be a way to be able to review even
more makeup and beauty products because
sometimes something isn't a fail but it
isn't a favorite but I still want to
talk about it because I still like it I
would still recommend it for certain
people it just wouldn't be right to call
it a favorite of mine so that's why I
decided to incorporate the fine section
as well so I have a bit to talk about
this month I actually have quite a few
fails but quite a few faves as well but
why don't I go ahead and get started and
I usually kick things off in the sign
category so if you want to see what I
thought was decent in the month of May
please keep watching
I sent a couple items from gorgeous
cosmetics I believe they are an
Australian beauty brand so they sent me
a couple items to try out and I have
pretty good time testing them out this
is our custom eye palette it's a 4 pan
palette and it said it was good for
green eyes so that is why I decided to
pick it up so this is what the palette
looks like and when I first opened it up
I was like okay fantastic there's a
mirror look at how big these pantries
are I was very impressed with that and I
thought these shades worked out pretty
well I do have a tutorial with this on
Instagram I did more of like a purple
smokey eye with it but I was pretty
impressed I wasn't like blown away it
didn't become
favorite palette but I was like um that
looks pretty darn good
I got pretty excited over this one still
a four pant palette is $32 which is
another thing I think that is really
expensive for four eyeshadows I mean I
get it you're getting a mirror it's a
nice little compact and the shades are
really really big but again it's why I
couldn't put it in a favorite category
because I think that is pretty pricey
with actual shades and the quality that
you're getting I thought were pretty
good so another item that they sent over
so I thought was pretty good is their
face perfect liquid foundation now this
is $45 which again is pretty pricey for
our foundation and I got mine in the
shade three and it was a pretty good
color match to me I will say that the
first thing that I noticed about the
foundation that I did not like what's
the smell there is a very strong strong
fragrance to this foundation so if you
do not like sense in your makeup you
will absolutely despise this foundation
because it is a very strong scent like I
feel like I could wear this as perfume
they light us a way that actually looked
on my face it gave almost a little bit
of like luminosity or dunas to my face
which I did like but it wasn't too much
like I didn't look super oily or
anything like that I thought it had a
pretty solid like medium coverage I
would say it kind of it did hide
imperfections pretty well I just thought
it made my face look very pretty and
dewy and healthy and I liked that I just
didn't really like the scent on this but
I thought it was a pretty good
foundation if you're interested in
trying out a different company or just
want to find a new good foundation and
you don't - scent I would say to check
out Gordon's cosmetics so I will have
their website listed down below swears
cosmetics did send me both of the items
but it was just for my review and these
were the two that really stuck out to me
from what they sent that I thought was
pretty good and that I will keep using
so I wanted to mention them in the fine
category another product that I thought
was pretty decent for the month of May
was the milk makeup Mars holographic
highlight stick it is what I have on my
cheeks for my highlight today there's a
couple reasons why I really like this
and I actually had to consider going
back
between is it a favorite or do I think
it is just fine
I decided to put it in my fine category
because typically for highlights what I
am wearing lately is like the obnoxious
blinding in-your-face highlight that's
typically what I'm going for and that's
quite as much as because I decided I
want it to go with this one it just
doesn't pack that same punch as maybe
some other ones do this one I mean I
feel like you still get a very very good
highlight but what I really like about
it is kind of like this pink iridescent
shift to it that it has so there it is
on my hand I don't know if you'll be
able to see it okay I do have my ring
light going but you can see I mean you
can see that my hand is shiny and then
it has that little shift to it so not
every day do I want my highlight to be
obnoxious and blinding but a lot of days
I still don't want a subtle highlight
and I feel like this is a really good
in-between for me it also is $24 for a
highlight I mean you are getting a huge
stick of highlight how is one person I'm
going to go through this I have no idea
I could share this with like ten of my
best friends and we still wouldn't be
able to go through this like it's crazy
how much product you're getting so I
understand the price point I do and it's
sold at Sephora it is a more you know
higher-end brand but still twenty four
dollars for one highlight you know I'm
the person that says that is expensive
milk it did sense to me which I'm super
grateful for because I honestly don't
know if I would have picked this up
myself if I hadn't but now that I have I
think it's really cool I still want to
recommend it especially in case this is
your type of high layer that you really
like or you're really into like the
iridescent holographic look that is
super on-trend right now I definitely
want it to be sure to mention that one
because it has been something that I've
been wearing a lot lately you've seen me
in my Instagram videos if you follow me
on Instagram and you see my tutorial
that I've been using this more and more
because I really do like it so the milk
Mars holographic stick still a very cool
highlighter and I'm very happy with it
the last product that I have thought was
pretty good but I really wanted to
mention it because I just think it's I
just think it's interesting
so the brand's honestly for us to reach
out to me a couple months ago and asked
if they could send me some of their
deodorants so this is Laura talking
about
deodorant okay she said yes because they
have natural deodorants and here a lot
of people talking about making the
switch to natural deodorants and how
much better they are for you a lot of
like regular deodorants have is it
aluminum in them which can be a cause of
breast cancer so I've been seeing a lot
of people and even my own friends
switching to natural deodorants so when
I honestly first reached out to me I was
like okay I will give them a try and
I've honestly been really really happy
with them so this one is there see a
mineral and is a roll-on deodorant which
at first I was kind of like I'm not sure
about this I actually did get like the
stick deodorant as well and I did not
like it as much the roll-on I thought
was much better and like not messy at
all so I've been really happy with it
and it smells really good I like the way
it smells I'm really liking it says
introducing a revolutionary roll-on
deodorant that delivers a dose of
essential of essential minerals to your
entire body with an easy application and
it says our magnesium-rich formula will
penetrate your skin delivering
much-needed mineral to entire body while
actively keeping your under and fielder
eyes for 24 hours so I'll need to
honestly first website down below these
are only $7.99 which I don't think is a
bad price either and they're just
deodorants that are better for you and I
just thought that was a really cool
concept and I have been really happy
with these 10 was this one in particular
I feel like this is very comparable to
like my secret deodorant that I would
wear I do think it makes me smell nice
you know I don't worry about that and I
definitely do think it helps keep like
sweat at bay so only time for I find
myself not being able to use this as
what I'm doing sports or sports like I
played on a sand volleyball league and
the times where it's really really hot
and I'm out there like running around
like a crazy person
I feel like this doesn't do as good of a
job as my seeker window so when I'm
doing sports and things like that I tend
to go back to my secret but I only play
once a week and other than that the
majority of the time I'm wearing this
one and I just thought I would mention
that in case anybody is looking into
natural deodorant I know sometimes
people can say like they don't make you
smell as good they don't protect against
sweat and this one I've honestly found
very very compared
it's my regular deodorant so honestly
parks will be linked down below but
thank you to them for sending this to me
because I've been very curious to try it
but yeah I thought it was pretty darn
good ok moving into the fail category I
have some lashes here to talk about and
I'm pretty like I'm kind of picky in
particular when it comes to my false
lashes because I just I love them and I
wear them almost every single day and so
when I find lashes that don't work out
for me I get really upset about it so
these lashes are from eye lures they are
the luxe gilded lashes I'll see if I can
take them out so the first time I use
them I was like well these lashes look
kind of weird and then I tried again I
was like whoo I still don't like these
lashes I tried one more time just a
couple days ago and I actually had to
like remove them and take them off I was
like no please just look terrible so
these are what the lashes will look like
and to me like when I look at them I
don't think I would have a problem with
them but when I actually put them on
it's like the band is just way too thick
and you just cannot get these to lift
natural on your eyes and I prefer that I
like thinner bands that I just slip
right on there and kind of like blend in
together it doesn't matter how much
eyeliner you use with these it just does
not look like you're wearing natural
lashes I know false eyelashes are false
eyelashes but I feel like most lashes
can do a pretty good job of blending in
or at least not being so noticeable and
they're also double stacks which I
usually like double stack lashes because
I like kind of like the volume and
dramatic but it's almost like it's just
too much the band is too heavy the
lashes are too heavy I feel like they
weigh down my eyes I feel more lashes
from morning till evening and not have a
problem with them but when I wore these
because I remember I warmth like a nice
dinner one night and I felt like
throughout the dinner I was like oh my
gosh I can't I can't keep my eyes open
like this is embarrassing people are
gonna think I'm like falling asleep so
yeah I did not like this at all and I
think they're a little bit pricey like I
want to say they were like 11 dollars or
something which is pretty for a
drugstore ring so I got beads at alpha
so mmm I did not like these then the
other eyelashes I just tried these
another day and they're from ELF and I
was super excited because I saw and I
thought they looked really pretty these
are the winged and bold
it's the luxe
- kit these were sent to me from out my
Buffy these were sent to me from out
they look like lashes that I would get
along with and I was super excited about
on and then once I put them on I was
like oh no and I think I have them on in
my video where I'm talking about like my
ring light and my filming setup and all
that so I'll leave it link down below
but I remember I kept wanting to make a
comment like I'm sorry that my lashes
looks so weird I didn't but I really
wanted to because I was like I just feel
like you can tell that my lashes just
look bizarre so this is what they look
like and again I don't feel like right
off the bat looking at them I would have
thought that they looked weird and I
really I feel like I don't even know how
to describe how these ones look I just
knew immediately from placing them on my
eye like they just look like cheap
inexpensive lashes and I don't like
saying that because I know I'm talking
about elephant I know Alf is a more
affordable brand and I love I have a
favorite from outside we'd be talking
about next what they do is they just
they remind me of like the cheap
drugstore lashes they don't blend in
they don't look natural on the eyes the
band just looks funny it just they just
didn't work out for me and I was super
bummed about it because I really thought
that they were going to be good ones but
no so the elf other winged and bold
lashes I would not be able to recommend
I'm enough to get rid of these two well
another unfortunate fail this is from
the company la belladonna they are known
for kind of their mineral makeup they
did send me a really nice package and
unfortunately this list of this one was
pretty bad this is their eyeshadow
compact in despina I believe it is so
it's a nice little compact like this it
has a mirror in it and then it has these
four different shades and they let me
pick it out and I picked it out because
they had a really fun green color in
here I liked that Brown kind of
transition color and then two other fun
colors here I love that there's a mirror
but that's about where my love ends
because these shapes just don't show up
aids like just do not perform well on
the eyes at all when I was first putting
them on I was like
oh it's mostly just shimmer with like a
small hint of color and by the time I
put this on at about 9:30 in the morning
I remember like I went to the school I
came back it was about 1:30 and I went
to sit down to film and all that was
left on my eyes was a very light shimmer
there was no green in there there was no
brown in there there was nothing in
there and I tried it one other time and
I had the same exact experience like
there's just there's just really nothing
doing and this eyeshadow palette is $55
for four shades like that is so
expensive I understand again that these
are this is like a very high-end type of
brand I think that you can only get them
on their website which I'll leave a link
down below but I just would not be able
to recommend this at all so even though
I'm very grateful that they sent me a
package I love being able to try on new
brands I just was very highly
unimpressed with this one so shoot final
sales that I have for the month of May
is from Dermalogica it is there a
nightly lip treatment okay so I really
like Dermalogica I have a lot from them
and I really like a lot from them I
recommend a lot of things from them I
really like their skincare they did send
this to me in PR which I was very
thankful for I definitely don't have
anything like this in my collection I
never really even heard of it but it
says to firm hydrate and restore the lip
region with the fridge overnight
treatment it reinforces the skin barrier
function and helps reduce the appearance
of fine lines and wrinkles so it says
after cleansing apply generously and
massage into skin on and around the lip
area so I did this one night it woke up
the next morning and could see a
noticeable difference like my lips
honestly looked smoother cause I did
notice that I had two red marks on my
top lip almost like sores on my list is
what I would say they look like I wasn't
sure if you were supposed to use it
every single night or what was going on
but as well since I already see a
difference and I have like some weird
marks on my lips like I'm just going to
hold off so I only use this the one time
and it has seriously like asked
my lips I mean my lips feel horrible
they look horrible it is insane so those
two red marks on my lips basically
turned into like huge dry patches and my
lists are like peeling off like peeling
and crackly and disgusting and I feel
like I don't even enjoy wearing
lipsticks my lips look and feel
absolutely horrible
I really like putting lip gloss on or
you know lip treatments on I enjoy doing
that but I feel like I am having to be
doing that I can't go without having
something on my lips throughout the day
because my lips hurt so bad they feel so
dry they are so cracked it is insane I
don't know what's in this I don't know
what happened I don't know if anybody
else has had the same experience but
this was like awful I'm not normally a
super negative person and I don't
usually like go off on makeup but hold
my gosh it has been almost a full week
from if I use this and think it's been
five or six days and my list I feel like
are not getting better and because it
said rub it around your whole lip area I
did and even like here and then right on
my top list it's like super dry and like
peeling as well I don't know what's in
this but I do not recommend this at all
it has done horrible things for my lips
and no I just no no I mean I really like
Dermalogica I do have a lot from them I
like the brand but this is definitely a
product that I cannot recommend I hate
what's end of my lip so if you notice
that my lipstick looks weird or just my
lips look strange in general this is why
hopefully it goes back to normal
sometime I'm using like exfoliating
scrub sugar scrub lip treatments like
I'm trying to do whatever I can to get
my lips back because this is made me
very sad sorry so let's move on to
favorites Shelly so I do have some
favorites that I want to touch on this
month one I do have a full view on but I
thought I'd mention it here real quick
I'm going to try not to include products
that I have maybe like reviewed or done
like a whole follow up on or things like
that just cuz I know these videos can be
a bit longer and I don't want to get too
repetitive as I've already mentioned
thing
in the past but this one I did want to
give a shout-out to because I do really
love the new Carly Bible &amp;amp; bh n bh
cosmetics deluxe edition palette is
gorgeous i've been having so much fun
with this palette and also her bracelet
and wearing one of them right now the
pronoun beauty bracelet I just I get so
many compliments on them I think they
are so pretty so I will have my video
linked down below in case you were
interested in seeing about this palette
and the bracelet and my giveaway should
still be open I am giving away this
palette and a pronoun a beauty bracelet
away so I'll leave that video link down
below but I've been so happy with this
palette and so pretty and it's so
affordable so yes I highly highly
recommend the Carly and BH palette
another item I just want to touch on
quickly because they did a full video
about it but these are the only daily
facials the daily clean four in one
activated cloth I love these things if
you are someone like me who is very like
on the go and sometimes you don't have a
ton of time for skincare these are so so
handy because all it is is one dry cloth
you get it wet and the water activates
it and it will take off all of your
makeup all of it liquid lipstick
eyeliner everything it takes everything
off and then it will also cleanse your
face as well so it's like I mean it's a
foreign one because it says it can be a
toner and a scrub too but definitely it
is for people who like to multitask
which is definitely me so if you're
looking for some easy and affordable
skin care the only ones I think are
really really good you follow me on
snapchat you know this perfume has
become like my life this is from Kenzel
perfumes and it is the woodsy Lumiere
fragrance and it smells so so good this
was sent to me via actally where what's
that kind of experience and bloggers and
I am so happy I asked for this but I'm
also kind of mad at the same time
because I will actually repurchase this
and I think it's $62 sixty to seventy
two dollars you can get it out like
Sephora and Bloomingdale's and Macy's I
think but I'll have it linked down below
but it smells amazing it is such a light
fragrance I don't like really heavy
perfumes it is light and fruity and
floral and it smells so so good I've
been obsessed with this perfume so this
mascara I actually purchased during this
ibid hall and then I realized that I
haven't tried it out when I did my
Sephora vib sale all follow-up video
it's because I wear false lashes so much
that I don't normally reach for mascara
but this one it was actually a 100-point
perk so I picked it up on the
recommendations of Rachel love it is the
shoc mascara from a YSL and whole my
gosh this is an amazing mascara I did
some traveling over Memorial Day weekend
I believe it was and I just didn't have
time like we were rushing around
everywhere and when we welcome in the
morning where we're going again like I
didn't have time to mess around with
false lashes and so iris brought this
YSL mascara and it is freaking
phenomenal it works so well this is what
the wand looks like it does amazing
things for your lashes and makes them
longer and makes them fuller it is
really really good I know why I fell is
a little bit more pricey but if you like
love having great mascaras if you're not
a big soft lash person and you really
rely on your mascaras the shock is
fantastic this is a blush bronzer duo
from elf cosmetics so this is what the
little packaging looks like an insight
is a mirror and then we have a blush and
then also a bronzer this is in the shade
st. Lucia and it is so beautiful now
these are definitely like lighter more
natural looking shades but sometimes
that's the look that I'm going for and
these are gorgeous I was talking about
this on my snapchat as well and just
saying how obsessed I have been with
this because they are so beautiful I am
loving these little duo's from ELF I
have another one it's from the aqua
infused lines it almost feels more of
like cream to powder where these ones
are just a more regular powder but I
have just been loving these and I love
the little duos because I have been
saying how I love things that are in
duo's or trails or pellets where I can
it's like a multi-function pallet I
really appreciate that I love the mirror
it's been easy to travel with
but these shades are so beautiful if
you're a lighter skin tone or if you
like a more natural blush bronzer
st. Lucia is definitely one to check out
I've been reaching for this as so much I
have one more favorite from the month of
May
it's the copper dreams brush
from morphe brushes this was sent to be
by my subscriber friend Jordan and I am
so thankful because I freaking love
these brushes so it is $40 and you get
all of these different brushes which is
amazing but I have become obsessed with
it and you get this case and then it
comes with the lid so you can pop it on
this is what I took when I did the
traveling last weekend I just piled all
the brushes that I wanted to in here pop
the case on it was ready to go otherwise
I use like an actual brush bag and I
need to like insert the brushes into
each slot was this one it was like so
much quicker just throw them all in
there and throw a cap on them I thought
it was amazing
now I will say like these two face
brushes I really do not like they were
very very scratchy like even just doing
it on my hand they are super super
scratchy the duo-fiber one I haven't
used yet but legit all of the other ones
I thought were fantastic and especially
the blending brushes are amazing I can't
stop reaching for these blending brushes
and like these four in particular I just
think they are freaking amazing I'm
reaching for them so so much I brush the
blending brushes in particular have
completely sold me again it's only 40
dollars for all of these which i think
is such a fantastic price I love the
case it's been helping out some it
organization and then also for traveling
is fantastic so I highly highly
recommend the set thank you so much to
Jordan for getting this for me because
I've completely fallen in love so if you
are like me you love makeup brushes I
highly suggest this set I think it's
really good okay so that's going to do
