today's video is going to be my make up
monthly for the month of May crazy if
you are new to my makeup monthlies they
are basically like a monthly favorites
video except I talk about my favorites I
talk about my fails and I also talk
about the products that I thought were
just fine I also do a channel shoutout
in here and at the very end of it all I
do give some book recommendations
because I'm a published author and also
a book blocker so I always have a lot to
Chadbourne these videos and I have a lot
of favorites this month
so let's jump into it all right I'm
gonna start off with the fail category I
just want to make sure I'd both my
earrings in I put one earring in and
then walked away for a while like did it
with the other ear again that would be
embarrassing okay
starting off what the fails the first
one here is kind of random but this I
don't even know what's happening with
this product this is from House of
lashes it's their eyelash adhesive so it
came like with a set of lashes or
something like that and like it's a
little mini guy it just like came with a
pair of lashes that I got and I was like
okay I've had House of lashes lash
adhesive in the past and I remember it
wasn't my absolute favorite but like it
worked it was one of those ones that
like yes your lashes stay on all day but
it makes your lash being super super
sticky and kind of like ruins the
longevity of your lashes because I wear
my lashes over and over and over and
over again so I pulled this out and it
has like the brush like you know the
little brush on here and it's white but
I think it's supposed to be a clear gel
or something but it is like the worst
lash adhesive I couldn't even get it to
like go on to the lashes and it's it's
almost like there's no product in there
but there is and I can see it and I can
see that this is a full bottle but
something about it when I was trying to
put it onto the lash band it was like
basically nothing was happening and I
was like maybe this is supposed to like
it's supposed to be like this but it's
like an invisible lash adhesive no I put
my lashes on and they don't stay on cuz
like nothing's happening so I don't know
what that was about but I was on the
House of lashes website the other Dyke's
I wanted to order some lashes and like
their big thing was like you get her
free lash adhesive what
and I was like no I don't want that so
almost stick with my duel because I
don't know what's going on there who
else have tried this kind of House of
lashes lash out he's of and did you get
it to work because I couldn't okay
another field that I have this one is
very sad to me this is from a sigma
beauty this is their 3d HD blender I
think is what it's called so it's like
their makeup sponge and you know it has
all these different like angles to it
and you're supposed to be able to do a
full face with the sponge now if you've
been watching my channel for a while you
might be saying mmm Samantha girl you've
recommended that sponge in the past that
used to be your favorite sponge are you
a liar I will explain so when Sigma
first came out with these they were a
huge hit and everybody was loving him
they couldn't stay in stock I was
recommending them I was using them I was
buying them for myself and so like I
remember getting messages from people
like do you have any idea when that
Sigma sponge is coming back in Psych and
I'm like I don't know I'm not sure but I
can't wait for it to so after it went
out of stock for a while they came back
but they freaking changed it why why why
do we change things that people love and
you're selling out and everybody's
recommending and then you change it why
because now I don't like it I don't like
it at all and I'm so freakin sad about
that it's it's very strange like when
you get it wet I feel like it really
doesn't get much bigger than this which
is awkward I feel like I have like a
tiny little sponge and I'm trying to
like blend everything in I feel like it
takes longer I just feel like it's just
not a good sponge anymore and I'm really
sad about that
I wish brands would stop changing things
that consumers love why so unfortunately
I really can't recommend this sponge
anymore I won't be purchasing more for
myself ah dang it
okay and then the final fail that I have
is a foundation and I'm super bummed
about this one as well I'm bummed when
any makeup doesn't work out for me but
this is from Catrice it is they're all
matte plus foundation this is what it
looks like I did get this sent it to me
from Catrice to try out and you know I
look at it and I see okay so it's a
matte foundation am I going to love this
I'm not sure but I'm gonna give it a try
interesting because sometimes especially
I've been doing videos lately um you
know I think I did disappointing our
makeup I regret buying video I've also
done makeup but I don't get my money's
worth out of and some people leave
comments like well why would you buy a
matte matte foundation if you know you
don't love matte foundations why would
you buy a matte lipstick if you know
that you have dry lips and I come back
to that and I say because you never know
there is some matte foundations that I
like the Laura Mercier flawless fusion
foundation I really enjoy that that's
mat that's full coverage the cover FX is
more matte it's more full coverage I've
really been liking that foundation there
are certain matte lipsticks regular
lipsticks that I actually do enjoy the
Kat Von D the studded creme lipsticks I
really enjoyed those so you just never
know and I kind of compared to like if I
went through my whole life like you know
when I was a teenager and I knew that I
didn't like salad I didn't like lettuce
and like really any ingredient in a
salad
if I would just never try that again I
would not know that I like salad now
I had salmon for dinner the other night
I used to never like seafood but I keep
trying and I keep trying and sometimes
things change or you find something that
you enjoy I think the same thing with
makeup so just because I don't have just
got something isn't my favorite is that
what I buy the most of do I have a full
collection of matte foundations no of
course not i buy do I buy luminous but
every once in a while I like to try so
hopefully that makes sense but when I
saw this I thought was a matte
foundation I was like I'll be able to
try it's fine
I was sent the shade 0 to 0 which is
nude beige it says it's mattifying
long-lasting and oil-free it just
doesn't look good on my skin and I was
trying it you know probably starting two
months ago and then I tried it out for
the two months here and there I was
trying it on and and seeing how it
worked for me it's just one of those
foundations that doesn't bode well with
my dry skin it kind of emphasizes those
dry patches but it just also makes my
skin look very very dull when I was
using this you know after the first
couple tries I was trying it with my
Beauty oils you know just anything to
try to liven up my skin to just make it
look a little bit more alive a little
bit more fresh but it just kind of like
sat on me funny and it just it just
wasn't a favorite of mine and what I
thought was interesting was one time I
was talking about this on social
or maybe I posted a photo and I was
wearing it and someone said do you like
that Catrice foundation and I said you
know I don't think it's gonna be my
favorite I mean I think I said I'm still
testing it out but I don't think it's
gonna be my favorite and the person
commented back and said this is supposed
to be like a do before the Fenty
foundation the frente mattifying
foundation and I don't like the Fenty
foundation either and I'm like well that
doesn't surprise me because it just
doesn't look very flattering on my skin
if you are someone who does like a
mattifying foundation this one could be
a good option for you someone who
prefers you know your dewy are your
luminous I don't think you'll love this
if you like mattifying I think that you
will it just is for me personally it
just didn't work out I just don't look
great on my skin or if you really love
the Fendi foundation you've wanted to
try it maybe you haven't yet or you want
a cheaper option for it you could check
out this one from Catrice I'm not sure
exactly where all this one is sold yet
because I've been having a little bit of
trouble finding the links for it but I
will do my best to find any links that I
can't down below but I mean it's just
one of those things you know you try
something you try something outside your
comfort zone and sometimes it just
doesn't work
so next I'm I want to move over to the
fine category I like to include the fine
category mostly just because I do enjoy
reviewing products and this is supposed
to be like a monthly wrap-up review
video but there are some items that I
really do like it just be lying if I
said it was an absolute favorite and I
want like and I'm very aware of that
just because some things don't work for
me they could work for others and maybe
something I'm saying in my review will
be like oh that would be a favorite of
mine or probably not going to like that
I'm gonna skip over it so hopefully that
makes sense I just got three products to
touch on here the first one here is from
a first day Beauty this is their coconut
my seller makeup melter so I mentioned
this one I think it was in my skincare
video I mentioned that I'd started using
it to remove my makeup but I would come
back and give a review on it so that's
what we're doing here today so it says
it dissolves all makeup even long-wear
and it's gonna be safe for sensitive
skin I am NOT new to first aid beauty I
found first aid beauty because it was
good for people with sensitive skin
which is myself I do like a lot of their
products so this one is a makeup remover
it has a pump on it it is $26 I believe
when you pump it out it's really
interesting because it almost kind of
looks like a lotion or like maybe even
like a boy
or something it's definitely not like a
cleansing oil smells really nice it
feels really nice on the skin as well
but I will say it's not my absolute
favorite makeup remover because I feel
like it's still leaving a lot on the
skin I feel like it does okay on the eye
area but I feel like I kind of have to
be kind of like rubbing and tugging more
on the eye area to get everything off
which I don't like and that's not good
you don't get wrinkles that way don't
think that it removes everything it can
be good for like lighter makeup days
maybe but if you have a lot on you cake
face on glitter on you got a waterproof
mascara it's not gonna quite take
everything off again I do like the way
that it feels I like the way that it
smells it does seem you know it doesn't
really do anything harsh or irritate my
skin at all so it's just okay I did get
this one sent to me from octoly so thank
you to octillion for say beauty for
letting me try this out I can't say it's
my favorite but it's not like the worst
makeup remover that I've ever tried if
that makes sense okay next up I want to
talk about this palette here oh boy okay
so this is from busy art and this is
their neutral matte palette so this
palette I have won it for the longest
time I really wanted to try busier
palettes I really wanted to tried this
palette because I thought we would get
along so incredibly well but this is an
$80 eyeshadow palette $80 that is
expensive if you wash my will i buy it
yesterday i was talking about like $50
palettes and I was like well close up
this one is $80 I did have a wonderful
subscriber sent it to me because she had
it and she said she didn't love it so
she said she would send it to me so I
could review it and I'm like you know
what I'm feeling the same thing I just
don't absolutely love it is it a
terrible eyeshadow palette no do I think
it's worth the $80 price tag no it
doesn't have a mirror on it which is a
bummer but I understand that busy art is
kind of from what I understand they're
kind of aimed more towards like makeup
artists and it's better to have these
clear cases with mirrors so you can see
what palettes you know you can look
inside your kit and you know exactly
what palette you're gonna grab so you
don't have any sort of packaging
covering up what's inside so I
understand that but also just the
quality of the eyeshadows just don't
really scream this is an $80 eyeshadow
palette to me I feel like I have better
once in my collection and even though I
feel like these are my tones and these
are my shades I still I don't get
excited to reach for this palette and
when I was trying to review it and I was
trying to wear it on my eyes I was like
what am I doing wrong
why are my eye looks not coming out how
I want them to why are they not blending
like I want them to and I just was super
bummed about that so again it's not the
worst palette that I've ever tried and I
can create nice like simple looks with
them which is I mean hello and that's
kind of what I have on today except I
have a sparkly eyeshadow base but it
just it's not a favorite of mine and $80
is a really really high price tag for
this that's what I'll say okay the last
item that I want to put into my fine
category this one here I was so excited
about I was planning on purchasing
myself I was pretty hyped about it this
is from Stila this is one of their
glittered let me say it right - GLIP
nope is it not on here glitter and glow
liquid eye shadow and beauty junkie so I
put this into a will i buy it video and
I was like I am so excited for it and I
was saying like I really wanted sealer
to come out with something like pink and
glittery I'm totally gonna buy this one
I guess it was supposed to be exclusive
to Mecca and the just Mecca
I'm sure I'm saying this incorrectly and
my Australian friends will let me know
what I'm supposed to be saying right but
it is also available on the Stila
website and people were letting you know
if you order from the steel website you
can typically get 20% off I was like I'm
totally gonna do it so I think these are
$24 so setting I was gonna buy it and
then my beautiful friend are not Elaine
who I talked about her more in a
second-- she actually messaged me and
said she actually got this she isn't
australian youtuber she went to an event
and this came in like a goodie bag she
said I don't like wearing Pink's on my
eyes I will send it to you I was like
send me the glitter all the way from
Australia she did and she sent me some
more goodies and she also sent me candy
that got eaten real fast Thank You Erna
but I was so excited and I was so
excited to try this out I
a couple times I've worn it and boiler
bite videos and I got really good
feedback on it know I'd be selling
Samantha why is it not on your favorite
category why is it only in your vine
category there's just like not enough
glitter for me I wish it was more
sparkly or something like it has less of
gold in it but I remember putting it on
and like see I feel like it's swatches
so freakin nice and I splash it at first
and I was like this is gonna be the bomb
and it is it's still really beautiful it
is and I like it and I'm gonna wear it
and I'm I'm going to love it but when I
put it on I want to put another glitter
on top of it because I wanted that
really like glittery pink eye look it's
more of like a pink base with a little
bit of gold glitter and I just I don't
know why I had it in my head that it was
just gonna be like pink and sparkles and
glitter and all this amazingness
it doesn't quite come off that way on
the eyes is it still really nice yes do
I still what I still recommend it yes I
love the Seelig litters I think they are
fantastic but again this is why I like
the fine category because I would be
lying to you and myself if I said this
is now my absolute favorite I still
really really like it I still think it's
really really pretty I just wish it was
a little bit more glittery you know I'm
thinking of some of my other see like
glitters like smoldering sat and I think
I reward the other day and like bronze
bell and kitten Karma I feel like
they're super glittery and this one just
didn't give me that pop of glitter that
I want it but it's still really nice
it's still really pretty I would still
recommend it Thank You Arnhem for let me
try this out so jumping over into my
favourites before I get into the
products I do my channel shout out and
like I said I was going to be mentioning
iron again Arnett Elaine is my channel
shout out for the month of May and no no
just because she sent me wonderful
package is that it's predetermined a
month ahead of time who I am picking for
this because actually how I choose who
is in my channel shout out it is who is
featured in my monthly newsletter I do
send out a newsletter every single month
I talk over some more product reviews in
there I've shared new releases just any
sort of like Beauty news I put into
those monthly newsletters and then I
also do an interview with a fellow
beauty blogger so I always have just a
couple questions in there to get to know
the bloggers a little bit better so this
month is
Alaine she will go out in dunes and
newsletters so if you aren't signed up
yet the newsletter hasn't gone out so I
will have the link down below if you're
interested in getting that newsletter
and then also getting able to read a Q&amp;amp;A
with Arnaud her answers were so so good
I love to read them so I will have that
link for the newsletter down below I of
course will also include Arnaz YouTube
channel
she is a newer ish channel to me by the
past couple of months here but once I
started watching her and I wish I could
remember how I even found her channel I
can't think of it off the top of my head
but once I started watching her I was
just like sucked in and every time she
posts I get so excited like I mentioned
she is an Australian youtuber I love her
accent she is such a classic beauty
she's fantastic and so many of her
videos just kind of give you like a
calming vibe I love when she does these
little chats and she's just sitting at
her table like drinking her tea chatting
with everyone
I think her videos are awesome she's
actually a violinist and I myself played
the violin in high school for like a
week and then I realized him I actually
don't have a talent she does but like
that is what she does and she is so
amazing and she just posted a vlog the
other day now is all about her music and
I clicked on that so fast and just
watching her play and create this
beautiful music is so freaking cool to
me I love it
I think it's so awesome to see what
people do outside of YouTube it's just
so fascinating to me so I love her
videos they are so beautiful they're
beautifully edited and she has some
great content over there she is a very
very fair and she does a lot of like
foundation reviews and like the fairest
shade that brands come out with so if
you are super super fair girl I think
that you would really like a lot of her
foundation videos but I just highly
recommend her channel she's become one
of my good friends over here we talk a
lot behind the scenes as well and I just
think that she's amazing so I will have
Arnaz channel I linked it down below and
I suggest that you go check her out but
jumping over into some of my favorites
the first one is a mascara this is from
a flower Beauty it's the lash warrior
mascara bomb flower beauty I think
there's such a quality brand there zoom
in mascara has been my favorite for
probably the past year or so I want to
say absolutely love
mascara this absolutely love that
mascara but I love this mascara as well
I did actually get it sent to me and
actually in the night I got a PR package
from flower beauty which I was not
expecting and it also came with more of
these and I was like score very excited
about that I wasn't sure if I would love
this one as much as the zoom in the zoom
in actually has those twist caps where
you can get it for a length for volume
or for curl and this is just like a
standard old mascara wand but you can
see it has this nice kind of like dip in
it if you can see it on camera so it
gets kind of thinner on one end so you
can really get out of the base of your
lash and be able to wiggle the brush up
to really extend your lashes I think it
does great things for volume for length
it is really hot right now in Iowa we
were out the other weekend at the
farmers market and it was in the 90
degrees and I wore this one and the
whole time I was thinking like have I
really tested if this is waterproof like
this is going to be the test today and I
kept pulling out my compact and I kept
looking I had zero transfer under my
eyes so I think this one is also
waterproof as well and will hold up in
the hot weather if you are currently in
summer this is a great mascara another
bomb product from flower beauty I think
it's about $9.99 and you can get it at
Ulta and I highly recommend I have a
favorite little palette here from morphe
so morphe recently came out with blush
trios i tried one out in a first
impression video and i was very
surprised at how pigmented it was it's
almost kind of one of those palettes
that are like too pigmented you can look
like a clown so you have to go and very
light hand it but they did send me all
of them in PR and I didn't keep all of
them I sent you know put some in
giveaways I sent some to a couple
friends but I did keep a few that I
thought looked interesting and that I
would get a lot of use out of these are
$12 and this one here has really become
a favorite of mine and just kind of sits
out on my desk because I reach for it so
much so this is in a pop of Rose so it's
really nice packaging really sturdy
packaging you have the mirror in there
and then each one has three different
shades I really like this one because to
me it's kind of like a face palette I
have a bronzer shade I have a really
nice neutral blush over here and then
this one it's kind of a little bit too
dark and too pink to be like a
traditional highlight but I can use it
as a blush topper and to kind of blend
it in with my highlight and I think that
it looks really pretty that way so I
like that I'm getting all kind of like
these three different shades in here so
this is the palette
that I've been reaching for the most and
I've just really been liking it like I
said you do need a light hand with these
because you're gonna get a lot of
product out but I really like it it's
kind of like my own little face palette
in here so it's also nice to travel
within to throw my makeup bag when I'm
leaving my house so I really unliking
this one at the most out of those morphe
palette this one right here this is from
Mac this is fix+ but not just any old
fix+
this is the lavender scent it fixed plus
and I'm enjoying this so so much I feel
like I just started using it I've
already been putting a dent into it
because it smells so nice and it's
something that I've noticed when I spray
my face with it not only is fix+ like my
like ogee and also probably my holy
grail setting spray I think it does such
a good job of melting the makeup into
your skin making it look more natural
but also prolonging the longevity of
your makeup I think it does wonderful
things but now having this scent I just
love the lavender and when I spray it
and I walk up in my office and I come
back in it's like my office is just
cheery and it just smells better and it
just makes me happy to like sit down and
start working again so not only do I
think this is a great setting spray but
I'm really loving the lavender one have
you guys read the other sense and which
one would be your favorite um again
these are $26 and you can find them at
Ulta I'm not sure if this sense are
still available at Ulta or fees for like
limited edition but I'm really happy I
have the lavender one so this is
probably gonna come to no surprise to
anyone this is from Marc Jacobs it is
the tantastic Omega bronzer yes finally
when this bronzer came back it was
limited edition it was sold out forever
when it came back at Sephora I was like
yes please I'm getting it and I also was
able to get it during the VIP fail as a
Rouge and so I got the 15% off which I
was very happy about because what is
this $49 burr bronzer for one brother
that's expensive
wonderful packaging a nice big mirror
obviously you get a huge product here
but you guys know if you cut my minis
video I typically don't hit pan on
anything I don't know if I would ever in
my lifetime or like my child's lifetime
areas do own this bronzer which doesn't
seem interested I don't know if I will
ever hit pan on this but it is
you just lit is beautiful it is one of
those bronzers that you can apply and
it's never gonna look too much it's
never looking too overdone on me I just
think it's gorgeous so this is gonna be
a summer staple for me for sure so next
up this is a bit of an older ish palette
like it's not brand new but I have been
liking this palette so much and I really
wanted to mention it this is from NARS
it is the wanted palette and this is the
wanted one they have a wanted one and A
one at two and one at one has more of
the light shades and I can't open it
there we go so it is just a cheek
palette so again nice packaging a nice
mirror and then you have these six
different shades inside I have just been
gravitating towards this palette so much
I've been wearing it on my cheeks is so
often I really like a lot of the shades
in here this is a really nice and
neutral kind of almost like with a
little bit of peach to it blush again
you have a nice neutral one over here as
well this cool toned one is actually
really pretty and I've been getting a
lot of use out of that one and then
these two like you can either use this
one as a highlighter I've been using
this one again it's kind of a blush
topper I usually don't do that step but
I've kind of been doing it more lately
the only one I haven't reached for a ton
is this one right here because it's a
little bit not quite my comfort zone for
blush but I feel like maybe as I'm
getting the summer tan rolling in maybe
that one might look okay on me but I
feel like I like so many of the shades
in here and they're super pigmented I
like the packaging on this but it's just
been sitting out in the front of my
blush like face palette collection for a
while so I wanted to mention that I
really do like this guy but it's
expensive it's like fifty nine dollars
but you can get it at Ulta if that helps
and support it's expensive but I really
do like it so I wanted to tell you guys
about it so next up I do have a tanner
that I wanted to talk about this one is
a super super interesting guy here this
is from a tan luxe it's the tan water it
says it's a hydrating self tan water so
you can see I've been using it I've
tried it maybe like three or four
different times now but this tanner I
just really enjoy I will say the first
couple times I wasn't quite sure what I
was doing the best way you use it or how
much to use it's trickier than just
using like a tanning mousse but now I
feel like I've gotten the hang of it and
I really really like it
so it has a sprite here I don't
recommend just spraying it onto the body
because that would probably
be really splotchy I recommend using a
tanning mitt like you would for a
regular most spraying it onto the mitt
and then rubbing it onto the body that
is how I would recommend it and I
recommend using kind of a lot like I use
eight sprays for like sections of my
body so eight sprays for like my knees
to my ankle eight phrase from my knee to
my thigh eight sprays for the bottom of
my stomach it's race for the top you
know things like that so you kind of
have to use a bit to get it to show but
once you do I think it leaves you with a
really beautiful and a really natural
looking tan I also enjoyed that you
don't have such an intense self-tanning
smell with this guy you know what I'm
saying it takes like several hours for
that smell to come in and then usually
after like the six to eight hour markers
when I shower and then I don't notice
the smell anymore but sometimes the self
tanners do put it on and you immediately
smell and then you're just like basking
on this end all day waiting to be able
to wash it off so I appreciate that
about this this one has really been my
go-to a tanner I think you're trying to
ask for and also also it's like forty
seven dollars I want to say a new
favorite lipstick shade is that I've
been wearing quite a bit lately this is
from Urban Decay it is one of the
comfort mats which is one of my favorite
urban decay lipstick formula and one of
my favorite lipstick formulas in general
this one is in stark naked it's a nude I
sure you guys are falling off your
chairs in complete shock that a nude is
one of my favorites but it's just like
it's one of those nudes that is just
like one of my perfect nudes I don't
know what else to say I think it's super
flattering on the lips I had to go dig
it out of my clutch because I'm only
went out last weekend celebrating my
book release this guy is what I wore so
this next guy is kind of random but it's
a brush that I just keep using and I
love and now if you watch my brush to
clutter I'm gonna go buy three more of
these because when I have favorite eye
brushes I have a lot of them this is
from a sigma
it is the firm blender II 44 so this is
what she looks like and I really like
this brush because it has a bit of a
point to it it's like fluffy but firm I
feel like I can pack shades on but at
the same time I can blend them this
brush is like it's like a two-in-one for
me and I think it's so bomb I keep
reaching for it I keep reaching for it I
keep washing it I keep washing it I'm
like I'm gonna have to get a couple
backup of these guys because I've just
been loving this brush so I want to tell
you guys about it
but to finish off my favorites I have
kind of like a lifestyle favorite that I
wanted to throw in here it is a drink it
was a lemonade so my husband and I have
been trying to cut down on our sugar
intake I don't know why it seems like a
terrible idea but that's what we're
doing so we're cutting down on sugar
we're also cut out soda and I used to
recently not have soda in the house but
I used to have a lot of Gatorades in the
house that I've drank in addition to
water but Gatorade has a lot of sugar in
it so we had to kick the Gatorade out so
after we kicked out Gatorade I went to
the grocery store and I picked out some
lemonade and I came home I took my first
step of the can of lemonade and all I
could taste with sugar and I looked at
the back and I had like 46 grams of
sugar or something just it was super
super high in sugar and I thought well
that sucks so I went back to the grocery
store try it again try to actually pay
attention this time and I found this
Minute Maid Lite lemonade it says it has
five calories and it has zero sugar zero
zero sugar on it five calories and it
actually tastes really good like it
tastes like lemonade to me it doesn't
taste super watered-down it doesn't
taste like water with lemon
it tastes like lemonade except it
actually has no sugar and only five
calories now the reason why I mention it
in this video which is super random to
me is because I'm sponsored by minute
may duh no I'm just kidding I'm not
minam I didn't know who I am but the
reason why I'm mentioning it is because
I set something on like snapchat and
Instagram stories about how much I've
been like in this lemonade has zero
sugar and I got flooded with comments
because I just posted the back I was
like yeah I found a lemonade with no
sugar I got full blended with comments
of what lemonade is that I need that
lemonade how did you find it loved names
no sugar where'd you get it like I had
no idea people would be so interested in
a no sugar lemonade but here you go
here's what it is
Minute Maid Light five calorie lemonade
we get the cans we just buy like a case
I don't know how many comes in there
maybe like 12 or something I don't know
we just I am buy the case now and I
probably drink a lemonade every single
day I think they taste really good and
now knowing that they're not terrible
for me I think that's winning so I
wanted to throw that in there
but after that there's gonna do it for
all of my beauty favorites and fails and
the fine products my channel shout out
if you are interested in here in the
book recommendations that's we're gonna
go to next but I know not everybody
needs book of recommendations so this is
where you're ending it I thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you in my
next video but if you do want to get
some book recommendations I do have it
to a five-star books that I've reviewed
on my blog this month and Before we jump
into those I will also shamelessly self
promote myself and I did publish a new
book this month if you missed it I have
a new title out there this is my sixth
book it is the first book in a new
series which is called the six and this
one is called Christie so this follows a
group of girlfriends in Chicago we start
off with Christie story a beginning
asked a lot if this is me and my husband
on the cover it is not a bozo being
asked a lot of this girl appeared as me
and if this is my friends it is not
these are both stock photos from the
internet but thank you so much but yes I
have a new book out I'm super excited
about it you can get it available on
Amazon and paper book in 'back ebook or
you can also order a signed copy on my
website so I'll have all those links
down below I also did a get ready with
me last week all about the book and
taking your questions and I also do have
a giveaway and there to celebrate which
is still open so I'll have that video
listed down below but of course I had to
throw it in there if you're looking for
summer reading recommendations check it
out but the first book that I reviewed
on chocolate + and give 5 stars - is
called the creep shell and the author is
Adria J Simona I don't know if I'm
saying her name correctly so so sorry if
I'm not but the title is called the
creep show I will have links to my
review and then also to Amazon down
below it deals with how females are
treated in the workplace especially like
corporate workplaces our main
character's name is Wanda and she goes
on maternity leave from her job and when
she comes back she is treated
differently she deals with sexual
harassment at work but is being treated
differently from with the men in her
department so I feel like it's a very
timely book that came out and I feel
like it's very it was just very
interesting and very thought-provoking
to read through the entire time and I
just I couldn't get enough of it so I
highly recommend the Creepshow and then
the other five-star book that I gave to
in the month of May is called the summer
sale and this is by Wendy Francis this
book I thought was so great at the
woman's fiction novel as well along with
the Creepshow and it follows three
friends they were friends in college but
now we have flash forward 20 years and
they are going on a cruise to celebrate
a friend's wedding anniversary and then
each three women you know of course have
something going on in her life and we
get all three of their stories and it
was it was such a good book I was
reading this during my Oklahoma City
trip and I was reading it as I was
coming back on the plane and even though
like I get motion sickness and a lot of
times I can't read on the plane I pulled
my Kindle out and I was reading it and
even as we were going through turbulence
I was like like I thought so everything
I don't know what happens
so I mean I feel like that's how you
know that you're reading a pretty darn
good book it does get a little bit
emotional at times a little bit sad at
times it cried a little bit near at the
end but it's a book that I wish we would
have another one on it which would get a
follow-up on the characters because I
felt so invested in each of their
stories all three women stories that I
wanted to know what would happen next so
I definitely recommend the summer sale
by Wendy Francis but after that that is
going to fully wrap up today's video
