were my favorites also the items failed
me and then everything in between the
items that I thought were just okay so
if you already see a my make up monthly
for the month of November crazy let's go
ahead and get started
Before we jump into the make up monthly
I didn't wanna let you guys know about
my 12 Days of Giveaways that is going on
right now today is a day five of my 12
Days of Giveaways but I've been doing a
giveaway every single day across either
Instagram YouTube or my snapchat today's
giveaway is going to be here on YouTube

below and today's giveaway I'm giving
away some skin care this is a site from
a Perry Cohn MD they recently sent me
two of their products and then they send
it also in this nice set as well and
said that I could give it away which I
thought was really cool so the two
products in here are the cold plasma
face which is an advanced serum
concentrate and then also the cold
plasma eye which is an advanced eye
cream I showed these on my Instagram I
believe it was when I did a haul and so
many people have responded and said like
they've been wanting to try this these
are supposed to be really great products
and all of that so I was like okay I
shall put it in a giveaway that you want
to enter to win at these skincare set
from a pair um see again the link for
the giveaway will be in the description
box down below my 12 Days of Giveaways
are super super simple the only thing
you have to be doing is to be a youtube
subscriber there's just a couple bonus
entries to go along with it but really
that's it just being a youtube
subscriber up and having a lot of fun
giving back across the 12 days and don't
forget to check me out on Instagram and
also snapchat because I have a giveaway
every single day coming up for the next
handful of days here so I did want to
touch on that but jumping in to the fail
category we are starting off with first
I have a set of lashes here and you guys
might know that when I don't get along
with lashes it's pretty devastating so
these lashes are from Tarte cosmetics I
recently picked up it was called the
man-eater set from Ulta it had a pair of
Tarte lashes the Tarte lash adhesive it
had a mini maneater mascara in there and
then there was one other eye products
that was in there but I was really
excited to try out these lashes I had
never tried Tarte lashes I was super
pumped about that
and unfortunately these just did not
work out for me and I just found them to
be pretty difficult to work with
I thought the band was pretty difficult
to work with and overall I just didn't
love the way that they looked on my eyes
and what I thought was interesting is
that the actual lashes to me just kind
of feel a little bit different I
recently tried the who Defoe mink lashes
and I really do not like them and I've
also tried the Ardell faux mink lashes
and I really didn't like those lashes
either and to me these kind of feel like
faux mink the the band not necessarily
because I've realized the faux mink
bands are just kind of like really large
and thick and stiff but these it's not
so much the band it's like the actual
lashes that I don't like they're like
hard and I don't know what they're just
they just were not my favorite but the
band I also thought was pretty difficult
to get the hang of I didn't feel like
they looked great on my eyes and they're
$12 if you buy the lashes separately
which isn't the most affordable but it's
not the most expensive for lashes either
but I don't know I just I could not get
down with the Tarte lashes unfortunately
and that made me really sad because I
love lashes items I hung out in November
that just did not work for me are these
eyeliners are from NARS and I believe
these are like 24 26 dollar eyeliners so
that is really really pricey these were
sent to me in PR with the manray
collection that nar said pretty recently
I do have a video reviewing the full
collection I think it's my holiday hits
and misses video I can leave it down
below and for me most of the collection
worked out really well but there were a
few items in there that were misses for
me and I've been trying these out and
trend these out and unfortunately I just
cannot get the hang of them these are
the velvet eyeliners this one in
Santiago it was kind of like a brown
bronzy color but again it just does not
really go on the waterline it was it was
really tough and I felt like I was kind
of pulling and it wasn't super pigmented
but the purple one like barely showed up
at all which was really pretty
disappointing like even to do with the
swatch on my hand I'm really having to
dig in the purple one is called Nagoya
so those are the two swatches of the
eyeliners here but again to pay over $20
for an eyeliner that like it's really
not very pigmented it doesn't show up on
the waterline like these are big mess
for me
so moving into the fine a category I
really like putting in the fine category
because there's some items that I just
would be lying if I said that they were
my favorites but they weren't absolute
fails but I still think maybe some
people could like them or get a good use
out of them or I like them enough that I
still want to mention them again I just
want to be able to be like this is my
favorite I just love it and that sort of
thing the first item that I have here is
from benefit this is the Boeing a
brightening concealer I picked this up
for my trying subscribers at favorite
makeup video and I know that benefit has
a lot of different Boeing concealers and
I think they used to have this product
in the past and then they've kind of
like a revamp did a bit and they have
quite a few different options in there I
picked up the brightening for me
personally because that's what I prefer
in a concealer but they have a lot of
different options and these are $20 they
come in this little pan here and I did
like the brightening because I can
definitely tell that it has kind of like
a like a salmony peachy kind of
undertone to it which with my skin tone
helps brighten and lift my under eyes I
really liked it for that like when I
need help if I have dark circles or
things like that and I just want some
brightness under there
I can even just mix this with another
concealer too and just put a few dots
really close here especially on the
inner part of my eye which is where I
get the dark circles wearing this by
itself as well I just take my Sephora 57
brush which is a small concealer brush
and I dab it in there and then Debit
right onto my under eyes the only thing
that I don't really love about this
concealer and why I wouldn't consider it
I love is that I find it to be really
really Creasy so whenever I use this I
have to use like a setting powder with
it I'm like an actual like baking powder
like you need to like heavy-duty set it
it's not just something that you can
kind of like quickly dust a setting
powder on the under eyes which is
personally my favorite way to set my
under eyes these days sometimes the
baking powders are just a bit too much
especially in the winter when I can get
a bit drier there just a little bit too
much but I know that I need to use that
with this product otherwise it will
crease a ton like very quickly by the
time you get done doing your makeup this
is already like a Creasy mess so it's
kind of like you have to set it right
away and set it pretty strongly so
that's the the one downfall I found with
it but other than that I really do like
the benefit point some more eyeliners in
here and these are from Mabel
I've had these for a while but I haven't
been reaching for them as often as I
could because they're metallic liners
and I just don't do those sorts of looks
a ton so I've had these for a while I
didn't want to review it until I had
actually been able to try them out like
several times so it's kind of taking me
a while to get this review well for them
but these are their master precise Inc
metallic eyeliners these are $7.99 at
Ulta and they come in a huge variety of
colors Maybelline sent me quite a few I
pulled out these two because these two
have really been my favorite colors I
believe I used the purple in a video I
think it was a first impressions trying
at drugstore makeup as when I tried this
but this green one I've also used and I
think it's really pretty I like this for
when I am not really doing any sort of
eye shadow looks and then I will just
come in and do like a really pretty wing
on top I think the greens really poppin
these are definitely very metallic and
very pretty they're a little bit
challenging like a little bit tricky for
me to get the hang of with the
applicator it's just I think my problem
is is that it's a pretty flimsy
applicator so kind of it can just kind
of like go everywhere it definitely took
me a couple tries to get the hang of the
applicator and actually learning how to
make a wing with it because I'm not the
best at that but they're very pigmented
they show up very well
they do dry down completely I didn't
have any issues with like transferring
or things like that again it's just not
something that I wear on you know a
really regular basis which is why it's
taking me so long
to review these so they're not
necessarily a favorite of mine but I
still think that they're good eyeliner
so again that's why I like having this
section in here if you really like
metallic liners are like funky colors
because the majority of these I believe
are kind of like you know the funner
type of colors I would definitely check
about for $7.99 I don't think that's a
bad price at all but yeah these are
pretty good so next up I have another
item from the tart set that I was
talking about that it came with their
lash adhesive this is the tardis Pro
lash adhesive this is just a little mini
guy that was in there the full-size cost
nine dollars this is a brush on lash
adhesive a so this is what the
applicator looks like and it is a black
adhesive I was really excited to try
this because
I've been hearing from Katie or lesser
Lux how much she loved the tart la shed
he sounds like wow try it out - so when
I saw that tart set and all that it came
with I was pretty excited about it and
decided to try this out now there are
some pros and cons to this and so it's
just gonna be like personal preference
on this one the good thing is is I don't
mind the applicator I don't mind the
brush on to the lashes versus like the
regular duo's that I use this more of
like a squeeze tube I don't mind that at
all sometimes I kind of wonder if I'm
getting enough product on there but
typically it's it's fine so I don't mind
that I like that it's black like I said
it definitely dries down pretty quickly
I don't have to wait as long with this
one as I would the dual because it does
get tacky because when you are putting
lash adhesive on you don't want to just
put it on and then put the lash on
because the glue is gonna be too wet and
it's gonna like be really slippery and
move around on your eye and make a mess
so you do need to wait with the duo I
typically wait like 60 to 90 seconds
with this it's like 30 to 40 seconds and
it's dried down and ready to go
so that part is nice it does hold the
lashes on very well which is great I
mean that your lashes are gonna stay on
and once you put them down and you stick
them down they are down so that can be a
con because if you're someone who puts
lashes down and then you kind of have to
wiggle them around in place you really
can't do it with this one because once
you've said it your lashes are not
moving the con part is that it can be
kind of challenging to get lashes off
this I typically can just go in and
remove my lashes and I have no problem
doing that but when I wear the Tarte
lash adhesive I have to like kind of
prep my eyes like already start to you
as a makeup remover on my eyes to loosen
up the adhesive so that part is
interesting and then the lash adhesive
sticks around on your eyes I think it
does not go away but about at night
remove my lashes you know take off my
eye makeup off and I think I'm golden
and I wake up the next morning and I
have clumps of ad-hesive in my lashes
and it just it sticks around forever no
matter what
you know I makeup remover I'm using no
matter what it is no matter I think I
got it all off nope it's still there so
it's not something that I could because
I wear a lot
shows almost every single day I can't
use the slash adhesive more than one day
in a row because then I have no chance I
will have residue from the lash adhesive
just forever it seems like so I really
have been busting this out only on like
special occasions when I know that like
I'm getting ready in the morning I'm not
coming home till late at night or like
I'm going to a concert I'm gonna get
sweaty I need my lashes stuck on the
entire night then I will go for this but
just for my more casual days I cannot
because it's like too heavy-duty if you
have tried the house of lashes lash
adhesive I would compare this to that
adhesive because it's the same thing
it's really nice it dry sound quickly
your lashes stay in place all night but
the residue the left over lash adhesive
is just too insane so that's why I can't
be a favorite but it's not a complete
fail that's what I think about the Tarte
lash adhesive next up I have a very
expensive lip product to chat about I
did get a PR package a couple from
actually from Burberry recently and I
didn't kind of like working my way
through the package I'm trying
everything out and then putting the
reviews and the videos as I go along
so this month I have a lip product to
talk about this is called their lip
color contour and it's in the shade
medium number 3 these are $31 on the
Sephora website I was looking at and
this is what the product looks like so
it's a pretty interesting pen like at
first I was like is this just supposed
to be a lip liner I'm not 100% sure but
as I used it I basically just lined my
lips with it first and then just filled
them the rest of the way in it is a
regular you know kind of like creamy
lipstick it's not it look what lipstick
it's not really like glossy at all but
it leaves a nice like cream finish to
the lips it's not what I'm wearing today
I have a new lipstick on today I got an
order in and I was like I have to do it
so this is from dose of colors but the
things that I really like about this one
is that I think it's a really nice shade
it's kind of like a nude brown but it
like strange enough has some pink tones
to it
one thing that I've kind of noticed with
Burberry lipsticks is that I really like
the shade selections where they kind of
look just you know just like a looking
at him I'm like oh you know it's like
your basic new it or it's your brown
nude but then putting it on I don't know
how to explain it but that's kind of
like what has been drawing me to the
Burberry
six because I have another like velvet
lipstick from them and I just am so
attracted to that color even though it's
a nude I just feel like it's it's
something a little bit different when
you actually put it on and I like this
one just fine again it's not a fail but
I want to be able to classify it as a
favorite it's a nice creamy lipstick I
remember I've had it on early in the
morning and I kept it down all the way
through the evening and it lasted
through my lunch pretty well like kind
of the like the creaminess factor kind
of wears away but the color like the
pigment on the lips sticks around for a
pretty long time so I think that is good
you know $31 is pretty expensive for
just a regular lipstick you know I
understand that's Burberry so you know
that's kind of how it goes with these
high-end luxury type of brands but I
thought it was pretty good I do think
that the velvet lipsticks from Burberry
are better like if you really really
want to try out Burberry lipstick you
got your heart set on trying to win out
what I suggest the lip contour shades
are what I suggest the velvet lipsticks
I would suggest the Velvets I think that
they're just a little bit better they're
not a full on drying a liquid lipstick
but I like them just a touch more but
this was still this was still pretty
good I enjoyed it and I will keep
wearing it I'm gonna move over to my
favorite sections if you are new to my
videos I kind of do a little a few
different things for my favorite
category I do of course talk about
makeup and beauty but first I will chat
about a beauty influencer just you know
a friend of mine or a favorite
influencer of mine who I love watching
their videos and things like that
typically how I choose the influencer to
put in these videos is they are who I
feature in my monthly newsletter I do
send out a newsletter typically every
month sometimes every other month and I
just have a few like more product
reviews and they're talked about you
know new products in there or what I'm I
what I recently purchase or just
anything like that I mean it's all
beauty related and then I also do an
interview what they fellow Beauty
influenced are in there I just asked a
few questions have them answer it and
then feature them feature their social
links and things like that so for the
month of December I already sent out my
newsletter which I was pretty proud of
that but I featured my friend Lisa
Stevens I recently did a collab video
with Lisa we are doing a skincare
project pan together so I will be doing
another video with her coming up here in
the next couple weeks we'll be doing our
one-month check-in for our skin
CAIR videos so I will leave those videos
linked down below I of course will have
Lisa's channel linked down below as well
I hope that you will go check her out
she does a lot of like project pans as
well like she's super good at those how
I found her was through her project pans
I'm her declutter czar so good and she
was been doing a lot of de clutters like
when I first kind of started finding her
she was doing so many of those and I
enjoyed them so much she doesn't my
stash I know right now she's doing
vlogmas and it's been super cool to kind
of get you know a little bit different
side of her with the vlogmas too and
like her family life and things like
that so I really enjoy videos I think
that you guys would too especially if
you do enjoy my channel I think you
would really enjoy Lisa so I will have
her linked it down below and I hope that
you will go check her out item that I do
in my favorites is I do talk about some
book favorites as well if you guys do
not know I my published author of five
novels and I am also a book blogger I
started a book blog all the way back in
2009 I do a bunch of book reviews on
their author interviews I do a lot of
like marketing editing proofreading for
the book industry as well so that's a
big part of my life so after I get
through talking about makeup and beauty
favorites I will touch on I think I have
three books that I reviewed in November
on chocolate plus that I gave a
five-star review to which is the best
that you can review a book on Amazon so
I was right about those after the makeup
and beauty favorites so if you're a book
lover like me or you want to get some
book recommendations stay tuned for that
but to jumping into my makeup favorites
this first one is really gonna come as
no surprise because I've been talking
about it everywhere it's made it into
several of my videos but just in case
you're new here or you haven't heard the
work I love the Urban Decay afterglow
eight hour powder highlight in sin this
turned into a new a favorite highlight
of mine and I'm grateful to a lot of you
guys because this was another one that I
put in my trying subscribers a favorite
makeup video so I will have that one
linked down below in case you didn't see
it but I tried this one and I was like
oh my gosh completely blown away
at these highlights in in particular is
one that I absolutely love and one that
so many people recommend it that I try I
think it's beautiful I think it's
blinding if you like a blinding
highlight it is just gorgeous and I'm
super excited because I did order the
new highlight palette that Urban Decay
put out the ONS highlight palette and is
on its way to me and I'm super stoked
about that so this highlight definitely
made me want to purchase that highlight
have another product here from a trying
subscribers new makeup yes you guys
we're good at this one and Tinka I have
you to thank for this makeup forever
recommendation this is a artist a face
color contour powder and s11 - is the
shade name I did purchase a couple
different items from Make Up For Ever
for that video but this contour shade is
just like calling to me so much I love
it it comes in this little pan like this
it is magnetic so I typically just have
it in a Z palette so I just talked about
to share about it and I really really
liked this one if you are my skin tone
you would probably would make this
contour shade work for you
they are $23 or Sephora has especially I
think Make Up For Ever website does too
but I got mine from Sephora or you can
actually either pick two products or you
can pick three products and you can get
them for a little bit of a discount and
they also come in the pan that you can
put them directly in have that option as
well but you know this contour shade I
reach for it so so often I think it is
gorgeous I'm constantly pulling out the
Z palette that has this in here so this
contour shade from Make Up For Ever was
a big favorite of mine so if I did just
recently talk about this one in my
Sephora vib sale haul a follow up video
if you guys haven't seen that one yet
that one is a full of reviews in there
so I will have that listed down below
but like I love this product so much
that I wanted to mention it again
there's a lot of hits and misses in
there and I try not to overlap too much
especially that I just posted that video
I think it was Sunday's video I try not
to overlap too much in there but this
one I have to overlap this is the Ola
Hendrix in a poor balance at facial
sauna scrub I love this guy so much this
is what I currently have in my shower
and it's just my favorite scrub right
now I picked up the three glowing scrubs
I think is what it was called
they set from Lula Hendrickson during
the Sephora vib sale it was $25 for
three minis and I'm having a blast I
love this one so much I'm already first
certain that I will put that I will
repurchase this in the full-size I want
to try out the two other scrubs at first
though but then I feel like this is
gonna be the winner it's super cool
because it says it's the sauna scrub
when you first put it on and like start
to rub your fingers together it's super
super warm and when you put it on your
face it's like warm and luxurious and
then I let it sit I use it in the shower
I let it sit while I like conditioned my
hair and things like that
and you can feel it like turn cooling on
the skin it is so cool and I mention
that in my support video and so many of
you guys that
you've tried it too and you absolutely
love it as well so very very impressive
with a skirt from wool and Dixon I have
a couple items here from here I did
receive both of these from octa Lee I
chatted about them I think it was like a
last month on my Instagram but then I
keep trying them more and more and I was
like you know what I need to put these
in a favorite section I just I reach for
them so much I need to put them in my
make up monthly as well so this first
one here is the contour Diaries and this
is a contour palette and I have been
reaching for this so much so it has the
six different shades in here and like I
mentioned earlier I haven't so much been
into baking powder but I've really been
into you know these shades to set
underneath my eyes as long as I'm not
using a concealer like the benefit
bowing but like the Urban Decay all
nighter and items like that like these
are really really nice to use I mostly
use charm on my under eyes but sometimes
I use dream as well if I want a bit more
of like a yellow powder and then secret
is what I've been using as a contour out
of here and then passion is what I'm
using as a bronzer so I really I don't
use these too
really much for anything but these for I
feel like I really get a lot of you set
up they're really big pans and I just
feel like I reach or it's so often when
I'm going to for like my contour my
bronzer if I'm wanting to reach for a
palette i'm typically reaching for this
one from pierre it is $32 so it's a
pretty pricey but for me I've been
reaching for it so much and then the
other one that I have here is the one
that surprised me even more I like
contouring and bronzing I like contour
and face palettes so I wasn't maybe like
super surprised at this one but the
soiree Diaries this is an eyeshadow
palette I feel like this was really
getting a lot of mixed reviews I think
this came in like a boxy charm and so a
lot of people were reviewing it and like
I saw some really bad reviews on it I
saw some really glowing reviews on it
and I was like oh man I don't know what
to think so I did request it from my
actually free store and they agreed to
send it to me and at first liked it the
first time I used it I was like oh okay
decent like you know I could probably
put in the fine category and then I
reached for it again and I was like
actually I present like that look that I
came up with and then I would find
myself reaching for it like just because
like okay I need to pick an eyeshadow
palette and I'm reaching for this guy
and I'm like wait a second I really do
like this eyeshadow palette it's really
nice too
out you know if i'm using a glitter or
if i'm doing you know maybe the metallic
liner look or just something a little
bit funkier but i just need like some
sort of you know neutral base to lay
down then obviously you know you have a
lot of neutrals in here but these
shimmers are really really nice and i
feel like that's like kind of what made
this palette kind of stand out to me I
think I've worn every single shimmer now
on my lids and I just think they are so
nice I do typically use a damp brush
with them but when I first put the
shimmers on they still show up really
nice like they do not need a lot of help
I just found that to be awesome I like
all the neutrals in here this is
definitely kind of like my eyeshadow
palette it does have a nice mirror as
well but overall I was very impressed
with this so I was a little bit
surprised at this I didn't think I would
enjoy it as much as I did but I really
enjoyed both of these the packaging like
the marble packaging I think is super
cute too but I like pure they're one of
my favorite brands I was really grateful
to be able to try these out and a little
surprised that they both ended up as a
favorite
so another favorite here my friend
Candice is on me I'm really amazing a
package and not that long ago and had a
ton of makeup products in there now I've
been working my way through so many the
items and finding so many new favorites
and fun ones to try out but I have to
give a special mention to this one
because I this was another one that I
did not expect to love like when I saw
it I got excited but I was like you know
it's probably just gonna be fine right
nope this is the market Jacobs it's
called the high filter and it says
hashtag in stuck on it in 60 I believe
and inside you have like a setting
powder and then also a bronzer I mean
the pans are huge I've seen a lot of
these items from Marc Jacobs floating
around you have huge pan sizes you have
a huge mirror and I know that maybe a
lot of people would be like oh that's
great you think that that's a wonderful
bronzer yes it is I really enjoy that
bronzer I reach for it a lot but the
main reason that I'm reaching for this
is for the setting powder I love it I
love it I think it's fantastic
I reach for it all the time it's what I
have set on my undereyes today and has a
bit of a yellow tinge to it but I think
it makes the under eyes look so freakin
good this has kind of become like my new
favorite is reaching for this setting
powder typically if I'm not going into a
palette like that Pier one I'm just kind
of like a palette
like if I'm reaching for a couple
different items than they're on the same
face palette then I'm just gonna use it
for all of it but if I'm using a
different bronzer or a different contour
shade or not a palette I'm typically
always going for with this Marc Jacobs
one this is a price little baby at $49
so big thank you to Kansas for sending
it to me and letting me try it out but
I'm telling you guys I can't believe how
often I reach for this I even took it
traveling with me over when we left for
Thanksgiving and when I came back that
next day I was getting ready to do my
makeup and I could not find this and I
was devastated I was like where'd it how
did I lose it so much Shirley came in
here and just stole my Marc Jacobs
palette it was still in my bag I had
forgotten to unpack it but I was like I
was like crushed for a moment it's like
how did I lose it so that's not surprise
me but I love it
another one that I truly did not expect
her to love is from a sigma beauty this
is the chroma glow shimmer and highlight
palette I am an affiliate with Sigma and
they did send this to me and I don't get
everything from Sigma it's almost like
every other release or something and it
seems like that I will get the product
and when I saw this one come out I kind
of had that moment of like Oh that'd be
really cool if they send it to me
because I wouldn't buy something like
this myself but I was like this is one
we're like I won't be super bummed out
if they don't even though I love
highlights up I just was like looking at
the inside of the palette I thought I
just don't think I would love this I
don't feel like I would get a ton of use
out of these particular highlight shades
I really was surprised at how much I
ended up actually really enjoying this
one I just worried that the colors would
be a little bit too funky for me I know
that you're a doesn't craze is still
hanging on and people like doing these
kind of like funkier colors for
highlights but that's never really been
like my personal vibe but and so when I
got this I was like okay you know I
still need to review it I still want to
try it out and I started playing with it
and I definitely worth sticking it to
like these types of colors ambrosia is
like one of my favorites I really do
enjoy that shade in there but peaceful
is really nice too that one is a nice
kind of more like subtle shimmer it's
not too overpowering and it's not like a
full-on McCullough's is also a shimmer
and highlight palette then I went to me
is definitely a nice a subtle shimmer
but I was like okay I need to like you
don't step outside of my comfort zone I
need to try something a little bit more
adventurous and the only one that
doesn't really work for me is this lush
right here it's just
dark for my skin tone but bedazzled zeal
and philosophy are all very nice I did
an Instagram tutorial recently I was
wearing zeal on my cheeks and I think
what I like about this one and you know
some of the funky or tones in here is
that they aren't too overpowering so
it's kind of like a good way to try out
the kind of crazier colors for
highlights without it being like I have
a stripe of blue on my cheek if that's
what I realize with this palette and
that's why I think that I ended up
liking it so much I don't know if you
can tell even by the swatches is that
this is just me I went to church and
then swipe for each of them but they can
be kind of just more a little bit on the
subtle side like the purple one which is
Felicity that's definitely the one that
has the most like pop to it but that one
is also really pretty on the eyes I've
used that one as an eye color with some
of the purple looks but again I got more
use out of this palette than I really
thought I was going to and I actually
been gravitating towards it more and
more especially when I just want to do a
bit of a funkier highlight but like
nothing like SuperDuper crazy I will tap
into this one but again ambrosia is that
really nice and you know kind of like my
go-to regular highlight anyways so I
really do like that one I like the
mirror and I like the big pan sizes I
think that's all fantastic so I know
there are surprise another surprise did
not expect to love this one either
the last Beauty favorite I have is kind
of random but I really do love this this
is from a subong Laurie it's the
righteous butter creamy body wash don't
you guys I had to go in and take two
items out of my shower this and the
willow scrub I'll have to talk about in
these favorites but I did get a PR
package of from a soap &amp;amp; Glory not too
long ago and I've been trying out a
bunch of the products and one thing I
feel like I've realized about soap &amp;amp;
Glory is that I really like their
skincare and like their body care
products I mentioned their overnight
mousse I think it was in last month's
makeup monthly but their makeup is
actually made it into the fails part but
their skincare and their body items I
really do enjoy it says this is a three
on one to cleanse to shave and
moisturize and it says it's super high
hydrating with over 25 percent moisture
oils and butters and it really is is
like super thick and creamy when I put
it onto my loofah in the shower and it
just feels like luxury ating and
shower and it smells really good and it
just makes my skin feel nice I like that
it's not only the body cleanser but it's
super moisturizing at the same time and
I feel like I will want to repurchase
this when I do run out of it especially
for the winter time I feel like this
would be really beneficial I mentioned
in my I did my Beauty empty is alive
this past week on Thursday and I had a
body wash in there and I was like you
know what I really did like it but I
don't think I'm gonna repurchase it
because I found something I love even
more and I would repurchase that and it
was the soap and Gloria that I was
referring to so this is only $12 so I
don't feel like that's a bad price at
all I've just been really really
enjoying this that is it for my makeup a
favorite for the month so that's gonna
do it for the makeup and beauty portion
I will chat about the 3 books that I
gave a five-star review to but I
understand if this is where it that you
were going to stop watching this video
in case you're not interested in the
book favorites but if this is where you
leave thank you guys so much for
watching and I'm wishing you all a
fabulous December but if you would like
to hear about some of the books that I
absolutely loved in November the first
one I have is called a white picket
fence and this is by Laura Branch flower
I always want to say her last name wrong
but it's branch flower this was a book
that I chatted about pretty in-depth one
day on my snapchat because I actually
dreamt about this book like that is how
good it was I couldn't stop thinking
about it I had a whole conversation over
dinner with Mitch about it it appeared
in my dreams like it was just one of
those books but I will say that it was
pretty tough to read you know it's
really based off infidelity in the
marriage and not everybody can read
about those topics and I totally
understand it's hard for me to read some
of the things that were in here because
it just really it just really saddens
you it just really it makes me
devastated for a family that goes to
something like that but it was so you
know I was so emotionally invested at
the same time into the story and I just
thought it was so good I didn't want to
put it down like I said I was talking to
everybody including my husband who
doesn't really read and he definitely
doesn't read women's fiction but I was
still talking to him about it and then I
had to chat about it on my snapchat too
so really really good really powerful
story I found that I gave five stars to
is called the boyfriend swap and this is
by meredith shore meredith is an author
friend of mine i've known her
many years I have met her at least once
I want to say it was twice a book
signing events and I just think that
she's a great author I love reading her
books she writes a really really solid
chiclet so if you like that genre
definitely check her out the boyfriend
swap is about exactly what the title is
it's about two women who don't know each
other they end up meeting through a
mutual acquaintance and they decide that
they should swap boyfriends over the
holiday season because each of boyfriend
has a certain quality that our parents
would want and that their current
boyfriend doesn't have so they decided
to swap the boyfriends and I thought I
was really intriguing because when I
first started it and you know I read the
synopsis I was like why would these guys
go along with it but then you understand
why the guys go along with that as love
and it's just super funny to see a very
chick lid very like so many humorous
moments but so many moments that also
just kind of made you think as well and
I just I really enjoyed it I laughed the
whole way through I finished it super
super quickly it did not take me long to
read it also that one is the boyfriend
swap by Meredith Shore final book I have
is called a beautiful messy love this is
by Tesla's Tesla's is another author who
I considered to be a friend we messaged
each other quite a bit
and her debut novel is still one of my
absolute all-time favorite books I'll
have that one linked down below as well
it's called love at first light so so
good I was very excited when she put out
a new novel she asked if she could send
it to me which was super nice of her I
do mostly get all of my books in PR in
case anybody is wondering because being
a book blogger I get 99.9% of the books
about my blog from authors or publishing
houses so test did send this one to me
and this one is also super intense it's
a longer book so I will point that out
but it is very intense and it covers of
so many different subjects that we don't
always hear about different you know
politics from other countries I mean it
just was so fascinating and intriguing
to read but Tess writes so that even
though this was a very long book I read
it very quickly and I read the hard copy
version of it instead of on my Kindle
which sometimes can be harder for me
because I don't feel like I can pull out
a paper back all of the time whereas I
can with my Kindle I still read it super
fast her writing is very fast-paced as
well even for a longer book she doesn't
waste time with
unnecessary seems unnecessary stories
dialogue any of that it jumps right to
the point right to the point I don't
really know what else to say about
Tessa's writing other than she's one of
my favorite authors and I just I can't
wait to see what else that she comes up
with because her writing is so superb so
beautiful messy love bite test bullets I
highly recommend okay so that is going
to do it for my make up monthly for the
month of November I really hope that you

that I've been trying out and my
thoughts on them let me know some
