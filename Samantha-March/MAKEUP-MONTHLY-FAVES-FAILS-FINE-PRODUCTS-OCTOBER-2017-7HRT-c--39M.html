video is going to be my make up monthly
for the month of October I'm going to be
going through all of my favourite
products the product stuff failed me and
then everything in between the products
that I thought were just okay I always
have a ton of to talk about in my makeup
monthly so let's go ahead and get
started
in the past I was doing my justifying
products and then my fails and then my
favorites reason being is I just never
wanted to kick off a video on the
negative side because like I don't know
it's just something that bugged me been
getting a lot of comments and asked me
if I would switch up the format a little
bit and start with the fails move to the
fine products and then end with the
favorites so we're gonna go ahead and
try it that month and I'll just look at
it as like getting the bad stuff out of
the way yes but I do have a couple of
different fails throughout the month
first one is a skincare product this is
the pre cleanse bomb from Dermalogica
and this just did really not work out
for me it also came with a mint which
actually I really enjoyed a mint
I use this quite a bit the the actual
product the pre cleanse bomb I just
cannot get down with this it's in a
squeezy tube like this and then when you
squeeze it out the bomb is like very
very thick and I don't find it easy to
spread on my face even using the mitt or
just my fingers I don't find it super
easy to spread across my face but it
says that it's a deep cleansing balm to
oil to melt away any impurities and
makeup from skin so you're supposed to
be able to use this to remove your
makeup and I do not think it does a good
job at removing makeup I especially
don't think it does really anything
around the eye area I don't think it
removes liquid lipsticks glitter eyelash
adhesive
I mean eyeliner it really I have a lot
of problems when using this one the
couple of times that I tried using this
I always had to come back in with
another makeup remover to remove the
rest of the residue across my face so
I've been trying this one out I've been
seeing for the good things about it but
it's it's really done nothing for me
it's $45 like I said you get the met
with it which this I enjoy I use it in
my skincare routine quite a bit now put
the actual pre cleanse a balm is not
very good I have a couple products here
that I used in my testing new drugstore
makeup video I've been trying to get
some reviews together on
products that I tried out in that video
because a workup was a first impression
so I do have a few in this make up
monthly that I'll talk about but
unfortunately I do have a couple fails
so this next one is called the mighty
contour it is from soap &amp;amp; Glory
so inside you have like a contour shade
which to me was more of a bronzer and
then you also have a cream blush and a
cream highlight and these are all Korean
products it's $15 at Ulta I tried mine
out in the shade happy mediums really
didn't work out the bus for me the
bronzer wasn't bad and I like cream a
bronzer or cream contour I like those
more than I don't like cream blush at
all and I'm not a huge fan of cream
highlighter but I do it I realized that
it faded away pretty quickly like by the
end of the day I couldn't really tell
that I had a bronzer or like a contour
shade on unless I had gone also in with
a powder and then the cream blush I
really did not like that one at all I
mean I don't like cream blushes anyways
but again it was almost like you put it
on your face and blend it out and it
just was kind of like fool she gone
I was like wait what and then the
highlight really the highlight didn't do
much for me either I got more excited
like seeing it in the pan I truly just
thought it was like a white cream I was
like what is this it does have a nice a
shimmer to it but again it's not enough
it's just not enough for me it didn't
show up enough on the skin and again
like just overall I thought everything
faded really really quickly and then
last up in the film category and then
also from the trying a new drugstore
makeup were these quads from ardell
these eyeshadow quads so these are
called the sensual eyes eye shadow
palettes I got these sent to me in let's
live and then also cabana I will say I
typically try to mention if I buy or get
sent items every single item that I've
mentioned in the film listen to me NPR
unfortunately as though oh I hate when
that happens I love getting a PR
packages so much and if it thrills me
but you know a big reason why I get sent
PR is so I can give my honest reviews it
never matters to me if I get sent
something or not but yes these eyeshadow
quads I tried out which I think it was
this one let's live is the one that I
used in the video and then I have
I tried this one two times and then I
tried this other one two other times I
tried three and two for the eyeshadow
palace and unfortunately this really
bummed me out because when I was using
them I actually got pretty excited I was
like okay things are showing up well
they seem to be pretty pigmented when I
was going through in the video I used a
couple of the shimmers and I tried them
first without a damp brush like I
normally would with most I shadow
palettes I like to see how the quality
of the eyeshadow is without any sort of
like mixing medium or anything first
and I was like pleasantly surprised but
you could see by the end of that video
that the eyeshadow had already faded so
the next couple times that I tried in
that I went in with both these palettes
I was using a damper brush for the
shimmers and again it was like they
applied really nicely like they apply
great but within like an hour to two
hours they are really really faded on
the eyes so they just do not hold up I
tried different primers and all of that
fun stuff and I just could not get these
eyeshadows to last on me
they are $12.99 which is pretty
expensive for the four eyeshadows I
would not be able to recommend these for
the price they ended up not working out
for me I had high hopes for them but
shoot switching over to the products
that I thought were just okay for the
month of October I love adding in this
section because there's so many times
where certain products cannot be
classified as a favorite like must-have
for me but they also were not a fail and
I would still like to tell people about
them and maybe they will work out for
you after you hear my review of them and
I do actually have a product here from
ardell that I did try out in that
drugstore makeup video that I liked a
lot more than the eyeshadow quads now
these are the matte whipped lipstick
from ardell it's like their version of
the liquid lipstick this shade that I
have is an upscale flavor I also have a
red one I'll insert some swatches of
these so you can see them both and I'll
do the red swatch as well so you can see
it
I actually really like these I like them
in the video the the texture of this
liquid lipstick was a little bit
different when I first saw Matt whipped
and I first started to apply it it
reminded me right away of anasazi of
Beverly Hills I was like I am NOT gonna
like this because I do not like the
aviation liquid lipsticks but they are
actually much more comfortable very very
different
that formula they did not feel very
thick or moosie on the lips like the abh
ones do it was much more comfortable but
it almost feels like it dries too like a
powder when you press your lips together
when wearing these it's really like an
odd sensation it's almost like I've
powdered my lips it's very bizarre but I
wasn't mad at it it just took a little
bit to get you Suk's I don't think I
have another liquid lipstick that does
that but I found this to be very
comfortable and I found them to have a
pretty decent wear time they're not the
longest lasting liquid lipstick that
I've ever tried but they have a pretty
decent wear time the only other downfall
that I saw to it was that it since it is
kind of thicker it's also not super easy
to build up so sometimes when liquid
lipsticks don't last as long if they're
still like a thin and a formula that you
can reapply after you need it after a
couple hours then it's not so bad but
this one is kind of like doesn't last
the longest doesn't reapply the best but
it's still pretty good I still had to
give it to it it's still pretty good so
I did want to mention this one in case
you're interested in finding or trying
out a new look with lipstick formula
these are $9.99 so not a terrible pricey
they're a little bit more expensive of
course for drugstore because you can get
some other ones for like the five or six
dollar range but still not bad so I did
want to mention this another product
that I want to talk about that I thought
was a pretty decent is a from Tarte
cosmetics it is the pearly girl their
teeth whitening pen so I've been seeing
a lot of good reviews on this one like
on those four website there's all these
great reviews it's just a you know the
classic teeth whitening pen I see it on
the Tarte snapshot quite a bit
everybody's always using it to whiten
their teeth I'm like okay I'm just gonna
try it it's $22 I remember I bought it
either during like the eight percent
cash back or one of my gift card trips I
was like I'm just gonna do it twenty two
dollars like let's just try it out so I
think it's okay but it's not like
life-changing to me but it wasn't a
complete fail and the reason I say that
is because I do think it works and I did
notice my teeth getting whiter but I
have to use this every single day and
like four times a day to see the
difference when I only use it once a day
I don't see a difference if I skip days
like if I use this a bunch of days I
notice my teeth getting whiter then I'll
take like two days off but my teeth have
faded again and I'm like
I have this sitting out in my bathroom
notes by my office it's just always by
the sink because if I put it in a drawer
I will forget it
and I do like to have whiter teeth of
course who doesn't so I just always have
to have it sitting out so for me I have
to use it very regularly and multiple
times a day to see a difference so
that's kind of a bummer but it does work
so next up I have a highlighter that I
want to talk about and this is from
Burberry so if you know this compy
expensive this one was sent to me by
Burberry and this one is called their
fresh glow highlighter and mine is in
the shade rose gold its Burberry it has
great packaging very beautiful very
sturdy it has the mirror inside I would
have no issues like traveling with this
guy I know that my highlights not going
to shatter and that's great but it's $68
more this highlight and I don't think
it's all that special that hurts me to
say that hurts me to say because I've
actually tried out a lot of different
items from Burberry lately I have no
idea how I caught the attention of
Burberry let me just say that I truly
have no idea how that happened
they've been sending me a quite a few
items and I've been trying out some of
the things I've been really enjoying
them and I like this highlight I do I
like this highlighter I think it's very
pretty it does take some time to build
it up you definitely need to use a dense
brush to really get the full amount of
payoff but it reminds me a bit of the
NARS double take blush that I reviewed
in my holiday collection review and that
I said it was like just okay but I
didn't think it was worth the price
point which I think that one was like in
the $40 range and this one is $68 like
yeah you're getting a crap ton of
highlighter but I just I think that
there are better highlighters I think
there's better highlight palettes out
there for that type of money I did want
to mention it because I do still think
it's nice it's a very pretty highlight
if you like more subtle highlights you
know where you just do the one swipe and
you got just a little bit of glow to it
which after seeing my highlight versus
matte makeup challenge oh maybe yeah
maybe I should be reaching into this one
a bit more but if you like those type of
highlights or if you really enjoy
high-end I do not think that this is a
bad highlight I just think you have to
work for it a little bit and for $68
like I don't think that you should have
to work that much but still a nice
highlight
just didn't blow my socks off for the
price ranges all so the last item that I
want to mention here in the fine
category it wasn't to me from my friend
Candice she recently sent me a box of
makeup and I've just been working by
white through it and send me the yes
please palette I have a nun up my eyes
today I use that in my triangle
subscribers that favorite makeup video
I'll have that one linked down below
this makeup look will be on my Instagram
soon I do do a lot of my tutorials over
on my Instagram if you want to follow me
over there a March Beauty word it was
really excited to also see this one from
colour-pop this is in collaboration with
Karrueche
it's the femme Rosa her face palette so
inside you have a bronzer and blush and
a highlight and I do have all three on
my cheeks today from this palette now I
really like this palette like I really
really like this palette and I went back
and forth up do I put it in the fine
category or do I put it in the fav
category and I decided to put it in the
fine because there are some times where
I go to reach for this palette and I'm
like no you can't you can't you can't do
it today this palette is in sanely
pigmented it's an Lea but it's kind of
one of those things where it's so
pigmented it can be a tiny bit hard to
blend and a little hard to work with if
you go in with a heavy hand you are
going to have like streaks of the
bronzer on your face like clumps of
bronzer on your face if you go in too
hard on the blush you're going to look
like a clown so that's why I'm gonna put
it in the fine category it is still
really good still really beautiful and
I'm gonna keep reaching for it it's only
$15 which I don't think is a bad present
off there's not a mirror which is kind
of a bummer I wish it did but for $15
and for three really pretty shades I do
think it's good I just need to warn you
because I've made my face looking crazy
a couple times after using the her
palette I'm gonna jump over to my
favorites for the month I do have a
beauty influencer to recommend I do have
some makeup favorites and that I do have
two books that I will recommend as well
at the end if you guys don't know I am a
published author and also a book blogger
I do like to recommend a BB influencer
and how I recommend my beauty influencer
is that I send out a newsletter about
every month or every other month and I
just have some more beauty reviews and
they're a standout product what I've
been eyeing a new release things like
that but I started
in an interview with a beauty influencer
and each month that I do feature someone
and I send out the newsletter I will
also feature her in my makeup monthly my
friend Kelly I will have her channel
linked it down below I've just been
loving watching her videos she has
amazing hair do you have so many fun
videos I just feel like if you are
someone who if you like my channel I
feel like you will really like Kelly's
channel to think that she's so much fun
I love her personality I love her vibes
I will have an interview with her
featured in my beauty newsletter just
getting to know her a little bit more
why she started YouTube some of her
favorite makeup steps or favorite videos
to make and that sort of thing so I
didn't want to give at Kelly a shout out
again her YouTube and Instagram will be
linked down below I hope that you will
go and check her out and let her know
that I send you so to jump into some of
my makeup favorites I found a new a
foundation this month of that I
immediately on first first application I
was like oh oh I really like this one
this is called the light Wonder youth
boosting a perfect skin foundation it is
from Charlotte Tilbury I found this on
the Beauty Alysha website for $46 my
shade is in five which is medium this
was sent to me from Charlotte Tilbury I
did receive my first PR baggage from the
Charlotte Tilbury last month which still
has me pretty surprised
not even gonna lie but I have just been
loving this the reason why I like this
foundation so much is because it looks
insanely natural on my skin and that was
the word that the first time I applied
it and I was looking at my face I was
like what is it what what is it about my
face that I'm liking so much right now
it looks natural but just better it's
like you know how you always say like
your lips but better with those kind of
like nude lipsticks like this this
foundation it's your skin but better I
really enjoy it it's a I would say it's
a medium coverage and when I was reading
on the bootylicious website it says that
Charlotte Tilbury calls us her holy
grail of foundations and I was like a
girl I get it I get why you said that
she did send me a couple other
foundations as well to try but honestly
I can't stop using this one this this is
the one this is the one that has me
right now and I am really enjoying it so
it's 46 dollars and you do get one point
for fluid ounces of
which is better than your standard one
ounce that you usually get but yeah this
one has stolen my heart right now so
next up I do want to talk about a sheet
mask I have a huge love for shape masks
I own so many of them and I do have a
couple of different favorite brands and
one of them is definitely Pathology this
is a newer sheet mask from them it is
called their milk peel 5-minute flash
mask I've been sharing this on Instagram
I'm pretty sure I think both the
Charlotte Tilbury and this a sheet mask
are both featured in my newsletter
that's what I really want to hit it home
like no I really really enjoy these
products guys you should check them out
so this one is also featured in there
what I really like about the pathology
masks is that a lot of them are only 5
minutes which sometimes other sheet
masks are 15 20 even 30 minutes to get
the full effect and petrology a lot of
their masks are only 5 which is perfect
for me as someone who's very busy and
who always likes to be multitasking and
doing things and I can't be doing all
these different things when I got she
mask on my face for 30 minutes but it
says that it dissolves dead cells smooth
and brightens without any irritation
it's inspired by a top Korean beauty
trend it says our plant-based milk peel
flash mask is gentle enough for even
sensitive skin which I do have and it
makes it for a perfect peel for
first-timers so I really enjoyed the
mask for that because sometimes peels
are anything that is too harsh will hurt
my skin will make it very red I have no
irritation when I use this and you can
tell that your skin just feels like the
word that I think of what after I use
this mask is soothed like it feels
soothing which is interesting because
its appeal at the same time but I really
enjoy this if you suffer from redness
I've heard a lot of people say that this
takes away the redness in their skin as
well so you can find pathology on their
website I do have a discount code with
them it is an affiliate code I will put
it here on the screen if you are
interested in but pathology is also
found at Ulta so I will have it both of
them at linked down below but this is
the sheet mask and keep reaching for
these days so I have some lip products
to talk about it I do have a few
favorites in here and that were also
featured and I believe it's yesterday's
video where I am doing the holiday
reviews I didn't want to put in too many
of those because I did do a very
in-depth review video just the day
before that I will have a link down
below but I do have a cup
favorites that like again I just want to
point it out reiterate it again in case
you didn't see that video and just let
you know that I really have been
enjoying these products so these are the
liquid lipsticks from a sigma Beauty I'd
have just been enjoying this so much
I've continually reaching for them my
shades that I have are a new mod which
is a nude mob lipstick and then the
other one is in Fox Club which is a
bright black berry I love both of the
shades honestly I really really have
been puffing the shade quite a bit these
are $15 again I just really like this
formula it's a bit more drying but to me
it's actually comfortable on the lips
and very long-lasting so I keep reaching
for these Sigma lipsticks so next up I
have an indie brand that I want to
suggest a few items from the brand is a
Chris Hanna and cosmetics I've mentioned
her quite a bit on my channel and on my
Instagram as well
I've been trying out her products for
over a year now and I've been so happy
with it she is an indie brand she's also
cruelty free I of course will have her
website and also Instagram I listed down
below but I really want to recommend
these newest single shadows that she
just came out with these are only seven
dollars apiece for foiled shadows they
remind me so much so much of the makeup
geek foiled shadows it is crazy so I do
have a 5 different shades I'll insert
swatches of all of them so you can see
them but I have been so impressed with
these I think they are so fantastic for
only $7 I feel like that's awesome I do
have a discount code with a Chris Anna
Anna as well it is much beauty I will
have it here on the screen I will also
have it down below and it would save you
15% and you can also buy she has a
bundle of all of the five single
eyeshadows that I will show in some
swatch clips you can get all five of
them for $30 if you're interested plus
then you can get the 15% off I really
enjoy her brand though and I enjoy her
like she's so supportive and I try to be
just as supportive back as I can I would
also really recommend her liquid
lipsticks and if you like metallic
lipstick so she has metallic liquid lips
as well but these single shadows I think
are awesome she's got a lot of really
fun colors and really enjoy this gold
all over the lid I think it is beautiful
but this dark blue one is also really
pretty but again they are really
beautiful foiled shadows and only $7 so
I know I said I have some more lip
product
so that I can mention I feel like I've
probably mentioned these in a favorites
video in the past but I've been wearing
them more and more lately as well so I
thought I would mention them again they
are the liquid lipsticks from Oprah
cosmetics I am just am so impressed with
these I've heard people recommend these
over and over and over again and I did
not purchase my first Oprah liquid
lipstick until this year this year and I
finally figured it out I was like oh yes
I really do enjoy these liquid lipsticks
I have Manhattan on today that was what
is on my lips it's a beautiful dark
berry color I think it is gorgeous this
one was sent to me from octel a so big
THANK YOU to actually and Oprah for
sending it to me they also sent me
Atlanta City which I was wearing this in
my eyeshadow palette collection and so
many people complimented me on my red
lipstick it was like Linux today from
Oprah it's a beautiful true red I love
finding true Reds not pink red true Reds
and that was what Atlantic City is but
then I do have it to other shades here
that I would recommend this one is a
Manila this is one of my favorite shades
this is the one I think I've had the
longest from was this my first one from
Oprah and I loved it it is such a
beautiful nude and then also this one I
just tried out the other day in my
highlight versus matte challenge this is
nude potion it was one in collaboration
with nikkietutorials and I thought it
was a really beautiful light pinky nude
so pretty but these have been in some of
my favorites at the moment I will insert
swatches so you can see what all of them
look like I love this formula I think it
is so long-lasting I think it's very
comfortable too
these are seventeen dollars you can get
them on the over website or they also
are available at Ulta one of my favorite
a liquid lipstick formulas imagine this
one real quick because I did feature it
in my holiday review video but the Becca
apres ski glow face palette that won
this one I love this I love the space
palette I love every single shade inside
I love the mirror
I love the bronzer I love the brush I
love the highlights I love mixing the
highlights I have been so impressed with
this palette I love the packaging I
think it's fantastic I will definitely
be traveling with us over the holidays
so impressed it's $54 so it's quite
expensive if you're gonna be shopping
the VIP sale I suggest getting it then
so almost finished of the next and
favorite
I had is from soap and glory so this one
was also sent to me from a sub and glory
in that PR package this is the speed
plump overnight miracle moisture mousse
alrighty then so basically it's just an
overnight sleeping cream it says was err
amazing bubble boost technology and I
was like what what is this so first of
all I love the way it smells it smells
like some sort of like some sort of
candy I will insert a couple of
close-ups of it too because you can see
it has like this this interesting kind
of bubbles that form inside it's very mu
sea feeling it's just it's it's so
different from anything that I've really
ever tried but I think it feels so good
on the skin I could just like massage it
into my skin force all along between the
feel of it
the scent of it I love it all we have
quite a few of sleeping creams but this
is the one that I have been reaching for
lately so this is a $20 I will link it
to the auto website down below if you're
looking for a new sleeping cream and one
that you can get at the drugstore I
would recommend this one from soap &amp;amp;
Glory it's been my new go-to then lastly
I want to recommend it to I creams they
are not dupes for one another one is
more of an eye cream and one is more of
an eye gel but one is a drugstore and
one is high-end and I really like them
both so I wanted to recommend them both
in case maybe one would suits you better
so one from the drugstore is this one
from Olay it's called their Olay eyes
deep hydrating eye gel now this one is
$29.99 at Aalto so I still don't think
that is pretty pricey for an eye gel but
it is really really good I was actually
able to work with Olay on a few
Instagram posts I did a 28-day challenge
with them and I have my full review on
my blog if you would be interested in
reading that I can leave my review links
down below but I was able to test this
product out and this was really the
standout to me I really really enjoyed
this one I love the cooling effect it
has on my skin and this is what I like
to use in the morning underneath my eyes
after I do all of my skincare and then
combined with this old lay one and a
little bit goes such a long way even
though this is a pretty small jar it's
0.5 of fluid ounces I mean I feel like
it's still gonna last me a really long
time because a little bit goes a very
long way and of course you're talking
about your under eye area you're not you
know putting this all over your face so
I still feel like it's going to last me
really long time so I've really really
been liking this one the high-end one
that I have is from belief it's the
moisturizing eye balm that this came to
me as a Sephora sample so the actual
full-size is quite a bit bigger and then
the full-size is $48 so 30 $48 I mean
just depends on which one works better
for you but I've never tried the eye
balm from belief but I have tried a lot
of their other products and I've been
really impressed with them and Wow was I
impressed with this one
this one is more of a thicker eye cream
I like to use of this one at night again
a little bit goes a long way but this
one doesn't have like the cooling effect
of the Olay one but it's almost just a
little bit thicker like you kind of with
my sleeping creams I like them to be a
little bit thicker at night and that's
what this eye balm reminds me of so
that's what I've been using and the
night time so I use Olay in the morning
and the belief at night and eye cream or
an eye gel is something that I'd never
missed I always have those in my
collection I always use them on a daily
basis and usually morning and night it's
just part of my skin care steps that I
cannot pass up so I wanted to mention
both of these because I've really been
enjoying them but so those are all of my
makeup and beauty of favorites that I
had for the month of October I finished
off with my makeup monthlies are talking
about some book reviews the five-star
books that I read throughout the month
but I understand that not everybody is a
book lover that's why they go at the end
if you wanted to keep watching and I
have two book recommendations that I can
give to you I will chat about those next
but if this is where you are leaving I
would totally understand that thank you
guys so much for watching everything is
always a link to down below in case
you're interested about any of the
products of that I did talk about but
why don't we move ahead and a chat about
to the two books that I gave 5 stars -
in the month of October the first book
that I have is called the one that got
away and this is by Melissa Pimentel I
believe is how you say her last name
this one is very kind of Jane Austen
esque I would say and I really enjoyed
it it takes place across the pond which
I right away I think is fun it revolves
around a wedding it's very chiclet which
I enjoy chocolate it's one of my
favorite genres to read like this one
because we get the point of view from
both of the main characters for B and
Ethan we get an insight into both of
their heads and I like the flashback
aspects so we get to see how they met
how they fell in love how their
relationship went wrong we get to see
all that in the past
as we see how they're coming together I
thought that one was really good so that
one is the one that got away and then
the other book that I gave five stars
too is called a see you later Broadway
and this is by Melissa Baldwin Melissa
is one of my friends that I have met
from being in the book industry for a
while and she writes at some amazing
books she's got a lot out there these
both will be linked down below I'll link
my reviews and then also the Amazon
links but I really enjoyed it see you
later Broadway takes place in New York I
love reading about books in New York and
I remember when I was writing my review
one of the things that I said was I was
just waiting like every couple pages I
was waiting to hear plot twister because
there are so many like twists and turns
that happened throughout this book it
really kept me on my toes but it was
very engaging and very fast-paced if you
love a chiclet books again I would
recommend Melissa and also a see you
later Broadway in particular
hey guys after those and two books that
I gave 5 stars - that's going to do it
