today's video is going through my makeup
and monthly for the month of September
where I'm going through some of the
items that I was trying out in September
a letting you know which ones are my
favorites which ones failed me and which
ones that I thought were just fine so if
you're ready to see some makeup reviews
from the month of September why don't I
go ahead and get started
quick disclaimer Before we jump in to
the video in case you haven't seen some
of my past videos I've been saying it in
there but we are in the process of
getting ready to paint my office and is
why if you see these crazy deaths behind
me those are where the shelves used to
be we took them down and we patched the
holes this weekend we are painting my
office so I'm not able to film for a few
days so I'm pre filming as much as I can
so I do not miss the video in my upload
schedule because I upload six days a
week to YouTube so when I can't film for
an entire weekend that means I got a pre
film to have ended to the content of the
video I'm going to start off in the fine
category I really love having this fine
section because there's you know always
items that didn't completely fail me I I
don't dislike them but I wanted to be
able and good conscious to say these are
my favorite you know what I'm saying
hers item that I want to talk about is I
really hyped a very popular product that
I think it's just okay
this is the Anastacio Beverly Hills brow
Wiz it is what I have in my brows today
and I have the shade taupe I purchased
mine from Sephora I believe this is $21
so it's a pretty standard brow pencil
with a spoolie at one end and then a
very precise tiny tip on the other end
now I think it's fine when I started
using it I wasn't overjoyed you know I
wasn't crying tears of happiness because
I found a new brow pencil that
completely blew me away but I don't hate
it
and apart from me that I don't like the
most is that I feel like I have to press
really hard on my brows with this and I
don't like that I know a lot of people
have said a good dupe for the brow Wiz
is the NYX micro brow pencil and that
was one of the very first brow pencils
that I ever tried because I always hear
people talking it up so much because
they were duping the brow is and
honestly I do think it is a dupe but I
don't
this for the same reason that I didn't
love the Knicks you have to press really
really hard on your brows to get product
out I like the end result sometimes not
all the time okay
it's twenty-one dollars I don't think I
would repurchase a new one I also feel
like you have to use a lot of product so
I feel like I'm about to run out of this
like at any moment where some of my
other brow products last me a lot longer
so you don't think I would repurchase it
I think it's too expensive and I just
can't say I love it but it's fine so
next up I have a lipstick which to be
honest I did not think that I would
enjoy nearly as much as I do I got this
into me I ordered it off octiline so a
big THANK YOU to actally in Geelong Chi
for sending me this lipstick because
I've had a great time trying this guy
out this is a love Rouge lipstick the
shade is 304 Mandarin Bolero I'm not
really sure how to say that to be honest
but the packaging is like legit like you
have to like press a button and then it
comes out it's like super fancy I mean
it's Giovanni so if you know kind of
knew that would be but this is the shade
I was wearing this in my 30k giveaway
video so if you haven't seen that video
yet you should because you should go
enter but this is the lipstick I'm
wearing in it it is a beautiful orange
and I did not think I would love it this
much I didn't think I would look the
color you know obviously I wasn't sure
about the lipstick part of it but really
the color I was like it probably won't
look great on me I don't wear those
colors a lot but I ended up really
enjoying it on me I got a lot of
compliments in that video on my lipstick
and I think it's really good it's very
creamy it gives me a nice you know kind
of a satiny Sheen to the lips the color
is really great I do have my ring light
on because it once again is storming
outside we've been having storms and
rain so much lately here in Iowa but the
color is gorgeous though like this would
be such a beautiful spring/summer color
so kind of under going into fall but
I'll probably be wearing it anyways so
these LaRue's lipsticks do run $36 which
is very expensive for a lipstick I know
that but if you're someone if you love
trying high-end me
I know a lot of you are out there you
enjoy the high-end makeup you enjoy
buying the high-end makeup and finding
like the new goodies and the high-end
makeup and what's actually worth the
money I would say check out these G
Vaughn Chi LaRue's lipsticks because I
was very impressed by the formula I was
impressed by how long-lasting this was
because I wore it in that video and I
remember I went on to eat dinner and
still at the end of the night you could
still I mean the lipsticks still looked
good the only thing that I noticed about
it was that the shine had faded away so
it almost kind of now looked more like a
matte lipstick which matte lipsticks are
my favorite so I wasn't mad about that
at all comfortable its pigmented it's
long wearing and if you love orange
lipsticks which I feel really weird
saying that I enjoyed wearing orange on
my lips van was I surprised I did not
think we would get on as well as we did
so I have this whole random to me but I
really did want to mention it because
this is why those things were like it's
not a favorite but I still want to tell
people about it because I think it's
pretty cool so I'm putting it in my
friend category this is from glossier
this is the coconut balm calm a
universal skin cell so I've been wearing
it as a lip balm but it says that you
can use on your lips cuticles elbows on
your friend anywhere that needs some
love that's what the packaging says I
did not make that up so I recently got
my first PR package from glossier which
was super exciting so I've been kind of
working through and picking out which
products I want to try out and I saw
this lip balm and I was like hmm
okay I'm not like a huge lip balm person
I like having it around and I typically
always have one by my desk in case my
lips are feeling really dehydrated or a
cracked especially in the winter time
I'm probably gonna have at least two
sitting right next to my desk when it
gets so dryer here in Iowa and my lips
really get affected by that especially
because I wear a liquid lipsticks so
often I was like you know I have other
bombs and like oils and things like that
like I don't know I probably don't need
to try it and then I saw my friend live
from little ups for makeup she was
talking about it on her snapchat saying
how much she enjoyed it so I was like
alright I'll give it a shot so one night
you know it's just clear I'm not gonna
swatch it or anything it's just a clear
balm but I put it on my lips and oh my
goodness it made my lips like Hello soft
huh they felt so good like just as I was
applying it I was like wait
second this is awesome why are my lips
so soft but I love the scent and I don't
know what I think it smells like I've
kind of been trying to figure it out the
whole time but it has some sort of false
scent to me like it reminds me of some
sort of fall candle but I can't put my
finger on which one it is and honestly
it's kind of driving me crazy if you
guys have tried the glossy a comb have
all calm and you think it has some sort
of false scent to it let me know what
you think it is because it's really
driving me crazy but I love it I love
the scent I love how soft it's making my
lips I feel like I'm kind of getting
addicted to it because this has now gone
right next to my computer and especially
at night when I'm just kind of hanging
out at my desk I'm like some lip balm on
no big deal so this is twelve dollars
I'll leave the glossy a website listed
down below but if you're a big bomb
person and I like it that says you can
use it on on other places as well again
I might have to revisit that in the
winter when I get really cracked elbows
oh my gosh
not cool at all so I might have to try
that but yeah I was I was pretty
impressed by this but next time I want
to talk about some of my fails for the
month of September the first one I'm
just going to touch on briefly because I
just reviewed it a couple videos ago
this one is the NYX of fire palette I do
not have it because I did return it to
Ulta that palette in a testing new
makeup video and then I did my follow-up
video about two weeks later so I can
have both those videos linked down below
in case you want to see me trying to use
it and then seeing my kind of final
thoughts on it but obviously I returned
it I did not think it was great at all I
was pretty unhappy with it my biggest
thing really was that I paid $30 for a
drugstore eyeshadow palette and I really
thought at that price point that NYX was
you know NYX was super confident in what
they were giving us and the pigmentation
was lacking in the majority of the
shades I bought the fire palette the
Reds and the yellows and there were did
not blend one of the shimmers were not
showing up I really struggled really
hard with that palette so I had to go
get my $30 back because that was just
unacceptable to me so I'll have those
videos linked down below like I said if
you want to check them out for a further
review the next viral palette I cannot
wreck
and that was a big ol fail for me I said
I want to talk about some skincare that
didn't work for me I've got a box box
from Influenster Influenster honestly I
don't understand Influenster for the
life of me but can take surveys and you
can get boxes to review items like
makeup and skincare they have like food
and like pets and you know all these
different things that you can review and
you don't have to be a blocker or
anything like that so I did get a box
back from them somehow I don't I don't
really know how because I don't do
anything on the site anymore novels and
it's like you're in the Lancer Vox box
I'm like okay thank you I mean thanks
but like what so I got some skincare in
here I got to be polish the cleanse and
then the nourish so this is the method
skincare set from Lancer and I was
really disappointed because this this
broke my skin out pretty bad
almost immediately after I started using
it when I do try new skincare I only try
like one new skincare like those I was
trying as a set that way I'm not trying
a bunch of new skincare if I'm having
reactions I can pinpoint which skincare
is doing it to me and so I introduced
this what I would do in the morning is I
would cleanse my face I would use the
Polish at night and I would use the
nourish both in the morning and the
evening
notice that my face was getting a ton of
those small whiteheads basically
everywhere and it was a really
frustrating like I mean luckily it
wasn't like blackheads or the big red
angry breakouts that you get it was just
those little whiteheads
but still when you had like clusters of
whiteheads around your face I was like
oh no house came I'm pretty frustrated
because I have pretty good skin I take
care of my skin I have a skincare
routine you know pretty down pat I have
my favorite products and I don't
typically deal with a lot of breakouts
so when I was having so many whiteheads
on my face I was getting really really
flustered so I stopped using this and my
skean cleared up in two days so I know
it was this so it was super bummed about
that and this is some pricey skincare I
think it's like 55 55 dollars and 75
dollars for some of these if you get the
full-sized products and I know skincare
is different for everybody I have very
normal skin but I do have sensitive skin
so I don't know if something just was
like reacting rolling with my ski
I'm not sure but unfortunately these did
not work out for me from the Lancer
skincare and they final item that failed
me in the month of September is these
appear sponges so I got these sent in
like a three pack from pur cosmetics
it's I looked on their website you can
buy the 3-pack for $36 and wow these
sponges I'm not great I'm kind of a
sponge snob but I did not like these at
all they're really hard and then even
when you get them wet they were still
pretty hard and if you can see like how
insanely like dirty these look a lot of
my sponges do not look like this after I
get done using them because I think the
sponges really like take a lot of your
product because my sponges I mean these
are one use only my son just do not look
this bad like it looks like I've used
these five times and haven't cleaned
them at all and so I feel like it's
really absorbing a lot of the products
but it was also still very hard I've
used the pure sponges before one comes
in the Cameo contour set and I think
that's a great one I think that you can
buy it on its own separately and it's
like twelve dollars or something like
that on the pure website I would
definitely recommend those so I would
not recommend these ones though the ones
that come to three-pack those were no
good unfortunately no these did not work
out for me at all okay I'm gonna jump
into my favourites I'm gonna start with
a beauty influencer I started doing this
a couple months ago I send out a beauty
newsletter like once a month ish ish
what some you know makeup reviews in
there and send out products new releases
and things like that but I started
featuring a fellow Beauty influencer in
there and just doing a little interview
with them and then sharing their social
media and their photo and things like
that and so I thought whoever I featured
you know the previous month I could
mention in my makeup monthly because I'm
never favorite of bye you guys seem to
like that idea and I love supporting and
just like talking about some of my
friends here on YouTube and you know
recommending their channels and things
like that so I did send out a newsletter
this month the last month I had
out yet so I just sent one out a couple
weeks ago and the influencer that I
featured in there was my friend Kendall
Oh Fred so I will have a Kendall's
channel linked down below she's a bit of
a newer channel to me but I did also
feature her in my recent youtubers that
I watch and love video so I'll have that
one link down below a lot of you guys
recommend at her channel to me I asked
for channel recommendations in one video
and I really went through and followed a
lot of the channels you guys suggested
and Kendall and I just kind of like
formed a friendship pretty quickly from
that which I thought was really cool I
just love watching her videos I think
our styles are pretty similar to one
another I love watching her reviews I
love her love for highlighters for
lipsticks and I enjoy watching her on
YouTube I also on her snapchat as well
so I will have her channel down below
and then her other social media links as
well I hope that you will go check out
Kendall and let her know that I sent you
and all that good stuff if you are not
yet subscribed to her but definitely go
check out at Kendall's channel alright
so to hop over to the makeup favorite
have one sheriff he guys might be a
little bit surprising but here we go
these are the Stila glitter eyeshadows I
know they have a really long they throw
it the Stila glitters you guys know what
I'm talking about the one that I had
sitting on my desk was in kitten karma I
talked about these so much I really
struggled with these I wanted to buy
them and I talked myself out of them and
then I was like nope I'm still gonna do
it at the vib sale and then I did it and
I was just kind of a mess over these and
I had a really sweet subscriber friend
Dimitra send me a whole bunch whole
bunch of the Stila glitters and I was
like girl no you didn't and I have been
trying them out so everybody can thank
Dimitra for getting me to fall in love
with these glitters because oh my gosh
they're actually really freakin good
okay okay any time that you've been
seeing me wear a very like fierce
glitter look in any of my videos I think
last month's makeup monthly I was
wearing one my most recent holiday
makeup releases video I was wearing it
and everyone's like what is that glitter
it's this feeling litter so they're
fantastic they didn't burn my eyes that
was kind of my biggest thing I have very
sensitive eyes and certain
Glitter's can really bother me I can
wear these all day long and I have no
issues wearing them I also did not
experience fallout I didn't even use a
glitter glue with these I just use my
regular eyelid primer and I did not look
like a disco ball off the end of the day
I'm very impressed with these they are
expensive I think they're like $24 for
one which is super pricey but I know
Stila has some sets out right now I'll
go ahead and try to find them so I can
link them down below because I think the
sets would be a much better deal you get
like three or five or something I maybe
they even have a few of them and they're
minis but honestly I mean I'm I'm gonna
have this my entire life so I feel like
the minis would be a great value and you
can try out a couple different colors
too for like the same prices buying one
full sized one so I'll have those link
down below but yeah you know these are
great so there's that I do have a
foundation that I have been loving on
this month this is another one that from
Givenchy I did get this sent to me from
octa Lee ang Yvonne Chi this is the
photo perfection of fluid foundation I
did not expect to love this as much as I
did but holy crap I really do with the
shade I'm in right now is a perfect
honey which is a great shade match for
me it does have a pump which is
fantastic but I have been I just I
really enjoyed the finish that it gives
to my skin it's not a mattifying
foundation it's not super dewy
it just gives you that nice healthy glow
that I look for in a foundation it makes
my skin look so good it's also very
long-lasting I wore this to one of the
concerts I went to recently I was
outdoors I was a little like oh man hope
this foundation lasts because I really
thought it was a long lasting foundation
but I'd never really put it up against
like the elements like that
nailed it did a fantastic job
it is $51 and you get two point eight
fluid ounces so it is a little bit more
on the expensive side but honestly I
thought frigimon Chi I thought we were
going to be talking like 60 like even
high $60 I think this is a really good
foundation I would definitely recommend
it if you're looking for a new good
high-end foundation to try check out
this one from as you bunchy so next up
I'll touch on these two lipsticks
briefly because I
it just review them and I did a lot of
swatches for them as well in a recent
video so I will leave that video listed
down below but these are the milk lip
colors I'm obsessed with these
I'm obsessed like I said I have a video
where I swatch I think it's like six or
eight of the shades from these lip
colors I did get this sent to me from
milk makeup but holy crap I have been
impressed when I was talking about it in
that review video I said that normally
when I get a peak hour package from a
company that's you know really large or
you know has a bunch of different shades
like lipsticks I typically go through
and I will only grab out a couple for
myself because I don't need about my
lipsticks and I really love you know
being able to put you know fun products
into my giveaways and and doing things
like that to be able to give back and I
have gone through and I picked out some
of my favorite shades and I put the rest
aside for a giveaway and then I fell in
love with this formula that I actually
had to do the really selfish thing and
go back and pick Oracle OSHA's to keep
for myself because this is a lipstick
that I want it in like every shade range
so that way no matter what lip color I
wanted to wear I would always have the
option of having this formula no matter
if I want it a nude a dark lip burgundy
lip a red lip look I want a one I wanted
to be able to have the entire shade
range because I'm obsessed with this
formula and they call it a Demi matte
finish it definitely looks matte like it
looks matte immediately when you put it
on your lips no shine to it nothing of
the sort it's immediately matte a soft
matte it's not drying or you know it's
not doing like that weird cracky thing
that liquid lipsticks do it's ASA I'm
just I'm obsessed I'm obsessed with
these they're $22 I know it's a little
bit more expensive
I believe the vib sale is coming up you
can get milk makeup at Sephora I would
put these on your list so for the vib
sale so you can save a little bit of
money with these if you don't want to
spend at that price tag on them but I'm
telling you if those are the types of
lipsticks that you like you want a matte
lip but you want to be comfortable at
the same time
check out the milk ones I have three
great products to go this next one is a
concealer that I instantly became
obsessed with and I know a lot of people
have talked about this concealer and
identify into it but this girl she she's
bought into it okay this is the Urban
Decay Naked
skin concealer anything that the shade
light and I'm just obsessed I feel like
I'm using this as much as much as my
shape tape which is like my number one
that's a weightless complete coverage
concealer I absolutely agree it's very
full coverage it doesn't feel like
anything on my under eyes blends out
easily don't see a lot of creasing with
this one it's just a really freaking
good concealer this next one is a
highlight this highlights this is from
Lancome this is called their dual finish
highlighter mine is in the shade oh five
sparkling peach we're just gonna call it
sparkling peach I'm pretty sure you
pronounce it differently but that's what
we were rolling with this was sent to me
from actually and a Lancome and when I
thought pop-up on my free store I was
like you know what I really want to do
it because I talked about these in a
will I buy it I talked to myself out of
it I was like oh I'm on this highlight
no buy so I shouldn't do it and it's
39:54 one highlight and is that really
worth it oh my goodness I did you wrong
and I'm so sorry did this highlight
because it is so beautiful i swatched it
in a live PR haul I was doing and I
immediately was like oh oh oh I got to
put this on my face right now no they
have a bunch of different shades this
one is the sparkling a peach if you're
into kind of a peachy champagne type of
highlight which I am I love it you get
so much product you get a mirror I mean
this is a nice little compact you're
getting a ton of highlight in here and
I'm absolutely obsessed obsessed with
this highlight Oh last stop before a
makeup favorite I have a brush this
might seem really random but this is the
morphe e27 the pearl blender it's seven
dollars on the more people website which
isn't bad at all
it's super fluffy super soft I'm loving
it effort as my first like crease or
transition color because it just glides
on so easily when you know a lot times
aren't coming in with that first shade I
wanted to be really blended I don't want
it to look you know too harsh or like
you know I just put a bunch of product
right here on my eye which sometimes if
you go in with a really dense brush
first that can be a big mistake I've
definitely learned that but with this
one it just blends everything out so
easily and I can't help
every time I sit down and do my makeup
I'm immediately reaching for this each
27 like a lot of the morphe brushes
definitely the ones that start with e
this is for their elite line they are
definitely higher quality that can be a
little bit on the pricier side for
morphe but there are definitely a higher
quality so the e 27 if you love a good
old blending brush I would recommend it
because I've just been digging this
brush so as a part of my makeup monthly
I started a few months back I got
requested to be talking about books more
on my channel as well if you guys are
new to my channel I'm actually also a
published author and a book blogger I
was getting asked to incorporate books
in here and so I thought a way I could
do that was in these monthly videos
about I post and at the end I can chat
about the books that I gave five five
star review two on my blog and then also
on Amazon so I like to close out these
videos talking about some of my book
favorites but if you are only here for
the makeup and beauty portion which I
totally understand this is a beauty
channel then that is gonna do it for all
of my favs fails and find products in
the Beauty categories and I thank you
guys so much for watching I'll catch you
guys in a tomorrow's video but I am
gonna go ahead and talk about some of
these five-star books so if you're
curious about some of the books that I
thought were absolutely fantastic and I
recommend for your reading list why
don't we go ahead and finish off with
some books all right so the first book
that I have to talk about is the
captain's daughter this is by Megan
Mitchell Moore this is a pretty
emotional story especially towards the
end it's a women's fiction novel I loved
the vivid writing antics place on the
East Coast and there's just some such
picturesque scenes that you feel like
you're immediately there and I really
enjoyed that I love the dual point of
views that we get from the two
characters that are very very different
but you know they are somehow entwined
like I said the ending is definitely
very emotional and not quite what I was
expecting and I cried a little bit at
the end and so if you love like really
moving women's fiction I would recommend
that the captain's daughter what I have
is links by ELISA Becker this is more of
a romantic comedy I love Lisa Becker
I've read so many four books and I think
they are all fantastic so I'd definitely
recommend that you check her out
but Lynx was such a fun story of you
know kind of that nerdy high school girl
who always crushed on the boy and
then they meet again years later and now
she's a little bit more put together
more confident with ourselves and then
it's just kind of that are they going to
get together are they going to admit
that they like each other kind of
chasing game which I thought was really
interesting so if you are fan of
romantic comedies I suggest they check
out links of Bramlett Lisa Becker next
one I have is a little gray dress this
is by Amy Brown I'm so excited for Amy
this is her debut novel she's a book
blogger like me and I know the feeling
of excitement when you're putting out
your first novel and you know you've
really worked so hard in this industry
and I'm just so excited for her it's a
little great dress I honestly if I
didn't know Amy and I didn't know this
was her debut I would have not ever
guessed this was a debut novel she did
so well the writing is so tight the
scenes move along so quickly and I loved
the story I was a lovely cover I thought
that was so eye-catching so if you're a
fan of chiclet
you know chiclet romantic comedy type of
vibes you gotta check this one out and
the final book that I have to recommend
is how to change a life this is by Stacy
Ballas love Stacy Ballas another author
that I'm definitely going to recommend
to you I've read so many of her books
and I've never been disappointed with
Stacy's novels I loved how to change a
life because it is about friends who
kind of meet up with one another again
and then they make a list for themselves
of certain items that they want to do
before their 40th birthday I believe it
is and this one really struck a chord
with me because me and my friends
created a summer bucket list just as
like a fun idea actually ended up making
our summer so much fun we had a blast
I'm now incorporating bucket list into
the current book of that I am writing
right now and I've just been having fun
with the idea of you know having this
list having things that you want to
complete and do before you know a
certain deadline or a certain timeframe
super into that so I immediately connect
it with the book but it's also a very it
gets emotional at times I actually
showed a few tears while reading this
book another fantastic women's fiction
book definitely I check out Stacy Bellis
and I highly recommend how to change a
life alright guys so that is everything
