so today's video is going to be my make
up monthly for the month of April this
has replaced my monthly favorites video
because in the make up monthly videos I
talked about not only my favorites so as
you also touch on my sales and then the
products that I thought were just fine
that I wouldn't categorize as a favorite
or a fail but I still like them and I
still I mentioned them and show a little
bit of love and explain why I think they
are in the sign category so I do have a
few fails couple fine products so I do
have a lot of favorites for this month
that I'm excited to talk about what I
was loving on but when I go ahead and
get started so the first product that I
thought was fine I'm not going to touch
on too much because I did actually talk
about and give a kind of in-depth review
in my testing a new makeup video but
it's the one wild photo focus a
foundation I have mine in the shade buff
bisque I'm wearing it today and I was
saying on my snapchat this morning that
I just I think it's fine I feel like it
makes my skin look dull I don't think
it's a bad foundation like when I blend
it in it doesn't blend all the way out
it does give me good coverage I'll keep
wearing it but it's just I just think
it's okay and I was getting a lot of
questions about it that's why I wanted
to put it in my testing new makeup
videos you guys could see what it looks
like and silly it makes my skin look
like flat and dull again I just I don't
think it's like a bad foundation and I
know it's super affordable because it's
white and while it's just not going to
be my favorite it's just it's not a
complete fail for me because I can make
it work but definitely not a favorite so
the next fact that I thought has been
okay it's from La Bella Donna and it is
their loose mineral foundation I have
mine in the shade Nicoletta
this was sent to me by la belladonna
they did send me a few other things and
I'm slowly trying to test things out but
this is the one that I feel like I've
been using the longest and I have some
good feedback on comes in like this
little canister and then you can kind of
shake out some product here it does have
a seal on it and it does say that you're
supposed to puncture for six holes to
achieve the desired value and you're not
supposed to remove the seal that did not
work for me at all I did like the four
to six holes I think I did the six and
then my shake shake shake shake shake
and nothing was happening so I finally
pulled the seal up a little bit and then
when I want to use it then I shake it
out and then I try to feel it as best as
I can but
I'm like I don't know why you have to
keep the seal on I'm not really sure
like why that is sometimes why I wear
this is I'll put on like a BB cream or a
CC cream and then I just want a little
bit of a better like finished sometimes
especially if I'm going out somewhere
ours I'm going to be wearing it all day
then I'll put this over it so I
typically need a little bit of product
but if you want this for your whole
foundation you can take you a very long
time to get the product out so I just
don't necessarily love the packaging I
like the way that it looks on the face
and super lightweight and just gives a
really nice finish to the skin like I
said I've been really liking pairing it
with baby trans or CC creams I don't
feel like I need to put this on top of a
regular foundation I just I think that
would be too much cuz it has pretty
decent coverage so all of that is good I
just I really I don't like the packaging
and it's $58 which i think is pretty
pricey for what you're getting like I
have a hard time at spending a lot of
money on higher-end foundations still a
good product and if you really like
mineral makeup if you definitely check
out labelled Adana
I know a lot of people really do love
this brand and there's a lot of good
reviews on them I do have some other
products like I said that I will be
reviewing I just really wanted to give
this a try first because I was very
curious about this I used to wear
mineral makeup like like mineral powder
all of the time I wore bare minerals
right yeah
bare minerals in college all the time
that was kind of like my go-to so I
wanted to give it a try again and again
I just I think it's okay it was fine for
me wasn't great well in horrible it was
fine
I thought Jess again if my lighting is
somewhat off we have not had sunshine
and someone just done it the other day
eight days or something like that we
have seen no Sun in Iowa which is very
sad
I'm pre filming a couple videos because
I'm getting a wisdom tooth removed on
Thursday May 4th
so I'm needing to pre film just in case
I'm like really swollen or don't feel
well you know for a couple days after I
get the tooth removed so I am filming
with my lights today I'm not a pro at
setting up my lights yet flip August if
my lighting is off in some of my videos
lately I just want to keep filming what
Mother Nature is not understanding that
you know spring has supposed to be nice
weather moving on I do have a couple of
fails which I'm super bummed about
especially this one like I don't I don't
know these are the LA girl Pro can
dealers and I feel like everybody talks
about these the finally la girl came to
also a beauty very recently and so when
I saw that I was like oh my gosh most
definitely I'm getting super Oh
concealers now these are only $4.99 a
piece which is awesome that's like a
fantastic price for a concealer for sure
now the one that I got for a contour
shade is in toast and I picked up toast
because I watch a lot of other people's
videos and a lot of people use toast and
I feel like a lot of people with my
similar skin tone use toast like this
shade is just insanely dark on me like
just just wait and watch these are what
the applicators will look like it's kind
of like that squeezy applicator which I
don't mind and it was kind of nice for
contouring I feel like I could be a
little more precise you could definitely
like nose contour with these well that
shade was just way way too dark for a
contour shade for me for a bronzer shade
for me light was a fail right off the
bat because it was the wrong card and
that's my fault and I can easily go to
Ulta and get a different shade and
that's what I thought I was going to do
I be using the one that I bought for
actual concealer and I bought this in
natural I kept using this as a concealer
to try it out and I was like you know
what I actually just don't like these I
mean it was like I feel like I at first
I was like kept trying to convince
myself as no you do like these that one
is the shade in natural so that should
have worked out really well for me as a
concealer color but I did I felt like
because I always heard people talking
about these and so many people use a
mint or cementum I was like clearly I'm
going to love them and when I wasn't
loving em I was like no it's just my
fault and totally the contour shade I
can get saying like it's my fault that's
definite the wrong color the natural
concealer is my color and I just still
don't like it
I think what I don't like about it is a
like I didn't find the contour shade
easy to blend like they it did not blend
it all again it's not my shade but even
if it was my shades
it still doesn't blend out the first
time I use it and I started to blend it
out I just had a stark dark line on my
face and I was there for a very very
long time trying to blend that thing out
it was horrible I actually started using
a Beauty Blender and then I went in
like a really dense brush and I was
trying to help the brush to blend this
away like that's how crazy it was and
then like the concealer it's interesting
to me because when I start to blend this
away it just like poof it's gone I don't
feel like anything is happening with my
under eyes and I'm a very big concealer
person I love concealers I love what
they do I don't want to leave my house
without concealer on but when I use this
I'm like I don't see any sort of added
benefit to my under eyes you can still
see my dark circles you can still see
like the lines around my eyes like I
have like some redness sometimes around
my eyes you can still see all of that
like I feel like it does absolutely
nothing I just don't like these these
for total sales for me and I'm super
super bummed about that because I get
that I was totally going to go and get a
different contour color shade and try to
still make it work but then after I
can't even make the concealer work for
me I'm like you know what I'm just not
going to and I have just not been able
to reach with these because I just don't
like them at all so these are a big fail
for me I was super bummed they're only
$4.99 they are also Beauty now I know a
lot of people love these so you might
want to try them out and you know see
what you think for yourself but for me
they definitely did not work so the
other fail that I have is from a
Smashbox cosmetics it's listened to me
in an influencer Fox box for my review
and unfortunately they really fell short
for me it is their new like the
legendary lipsticks I believe is what
they are called this one is in a
metallic finish is in crimson chrome so
I really like Smashbox one of my
favorite brands I really love they're
always on liquid lipsticks so I was
excited when I got this in a box so I'm
excited to review it I love lipsticks so
super stoked about that I saw the red
and I saw the metallic and I was like
we're probably like I'm like totally get
along but like hey whatever I'll try it
out see something outside of my comfort
zone it's not the fact that it's red or
the fact of its metallic that I do not
like it is the fact of like how messy
these are it's a creamy lipstick like
when I first started on my lips I was
like okay so far so good
or creamy felt good it was easy to apply
and so I was like alright you know this
could be okay and I realized that it
gets everywhere
like this a formula kind of reminded me
of the Too Faced melted lipsticks when
the melted in like the squeezy tubes
were all the rage and everybody loved
them I would wear them and have lipstick
all over my face like on my chin on my
cheeks I'm like what am I doing wrong
and that is exactly what this one does
even without eating or doing anything
somehow it is ending up on other parts
of my face and like and especially when
it's a red metallic it's quite
noticeable like I look like a vampire
sometimes so this really like bummed me
out I was hoping to really like these I
haven't tried the other finishes and
this one they had a big range of the be
legendary lipsticks but the one in
crimson chrome the metallic finish it
just did not work for me it just it just
was way way too messy unfortunately so
this one was also a hard pass for me so
I'm trying to take it off and it's just
like does that like come normally when
you would take off a lipstick swatch you
just like run the makeup wipe over and
it comes off like it's like staining my
fingers now it's going to do the rest of
video with like a st. Anne but now I
have some favorites that I want to talk
about and I'm going to start off with
some brushes you guys know like I love
makeup brushes so much and when I find
ones that I really love I get so super
excited about it so I have a couple from
royal and langnickel
they're motor brushes these were their
prismatic face brushes my good friend
Mickey actually sent these to me and I
was so shocked that she did because I
fell in love with these I mentioned them
in a will I write video and I was like
oh I'm not going to buy them I'm I
believe they're only available at
Walmart I don't shop there a lot and
with these type of like round brushes
they are super hit or miss for me I
either really love them or I don't like
them at all and do not reach for them I
really don't have any like in-betweens
so the first thing that I use these I
was like okay these are really freaking
good this is the foundation brush and at
first I thought this would be too big as
well because I don't like really huge
foundation brushes where I feel like
it's kind of all over the place but this
is like the perfect size and then I have
these two smaller brushes this bigger
one I use for cream contour and it works
out so well
- buffing cream contour I really love it
and
Molokai is what I use for my under-eye
concealer I reach for these bailer that
I really really like them so yeah if you
haven't checked out the motor brushes
from royal and langnickel I highly
recommend at first I have is from elf
cosmetics Elstad send me a package of
some of their makeup brushes and a lot
of support different eye brushes and I
like them just fine but this guy
immediately became a favorite at the
very first time I use it I was like well
we just got along really well and I just
cannot stop reaching for it and use for
my powder contour and it is so easy just
to stamp it right along the contour line
I love it I think it's a really cool
looking brush - I love the look of the
brush but it also works so well this elf
contour brush I thought was amazing
another project that I have is from
morphe this is the AR - I use this for
bronzer and I freaking love it first of
all I love big makeup brushes so like
Elizabeth Big Daddy I was like yes
please I saw Jacqueline Channel talked
about it in one of her recommendations
video and she said she is it for bronzer
and I was like I want to use it for
bronzer - it's from the rose gold
collection against the R - and I just
think it is an amazing bronzer brush
that I find myself reaching for this
every single day almost I just think
it's amazing so the more feet are too
great brother brush another item from
morphe that I really really loved as the
makeup tool is their flawless makeup
sponge it's dirty because I love this
little sponge you might use it all the
time this is what it looks like has it's
a little unique shape here it is red I
just I love this sponge this one and the
L'Oreal is has a similar shape to this
too but I think I like the morphe even
more which is why I wanted to mention it
in my favorites video but I use this to
apply my full faces makeup the morphe
flawless sponge I think is really
amazing another item that I say
different morphe I do have kind of a
like more few haul video where I'm
reviewing this palette this is the 35
are I love this palette anyway I would
love this palette like from the moment
that I opened it up and I started
watching and then I started putting on
my eyes of like I just know that I'm
going to love this palette and I do the
shades are so pigmented and so beautiful
and it's like every single shade that
I've tried in this palette so far has
been an absolute hit for me I just have
not been
point it and I just think it is so
gorgeous these are like 20 $2.99 for 35
different eyeshadows and I do not think
that you can go wrong with that at all
the morphe palette the 35 palettes I
mean these things are not what I would
call travel friendly like I mean it's
just it's not a travel friendly palette
but I did not care I went to a
bachelorette party out of town a couple
weekends ago and I was like I just have
to bring this palette because I love it
so much I went to a concert the other
night I was getting ready for it I was
like you know what I know I have some
newer eyeshadow palettes and I'm still
testing out a few - I shall palace but I
don't care like I want to wear my 35 R
this is such a stunning palette I love
it I would highly recommend this is one
of the newer palettes from morphe again
I do have a swatch tutorial video that I
will be linked down below in kids that
you want to see these shadows in action
but I love it I'm obsessed with this
palette just leaving my last item from
morphe is really a lot smaller and more
free and more freedom Babu alia I don't
have a discount Floyd was morphine so I
wish I did because I buy from them a lot
and I just really enjoyed our product
and the last haul I think there's a
couple up there liquid lipsticks just to
be able to test out the formula such a
lipstick junkie I love being able to try
out new lipsticks these are fairly newer
releases from morphe so I really wanted
to give them a try I picked up the shade
schoolgirl which is a really beautiful
pink and then peanut which is more of a
brown and I love both of these colors so
much but more than that I love the
formula these are so long lasting so
long lasting and the first time I used
them and I remember thinking to myself
that you know I put it on the morning I
remember I ate lunch I came back and I
went to touch up and I kind like looked
in the mirror like do I need to put that
no I don't need to touch up did I eat
lunch like it was one of those things I
was like I cannot believe it held up
because even though there's a lot of
what lipsticks that do hold up really
well typically after you eat something
you just you need to do a touch-up maybe
just need to do a small touch-up but
these guys last so well a lot of people
haven't asked me what I think it was a
more fuel if I don't feel like they get
talked about a lot I feel like with more
food we eat their hear about the
eyeshadow palettes or their brushes but
seriously the liquid lipsticks are
really good I think they're $12.99 which
is a little bit I know
feels affordable so $12.99 to me
honestly was a little bit on the pricey
side for the liquid lipsticks but
seriously I can't get over these I wear
them all the time I'm reaching for them
quite a bit I'm very happy definitely
want some more shades as a couple items
here from the company number 7 I mean a
really cool package and I was really
excited because I had never tried number
7 but I hear a lot of people talk about
them so I was super stoked I grabbed out
two things to try first but I really
really love and love to test out and
that is concealer and bronzer and I am
so excited that I love them both I
actually used the concealer in my
testing new makeup and you can see my
reaction that I might wish I can that
looks really good we need a second that
looks beautiful I had first impression
of this on there and I was thrilled this
is their radiant glow concealer in my
shade is in it number 10 and it is
beautiful it does give your under eyes a
radiant glow it is exactly what it says
it's going to do and I love it from when
I used it the first time in that video I
used it the next four days in a row it
was like all I wanted to use you know I
try to switch things up and I have a lot
of concealers so I'm always trying to
like try out new makeup products I don't
necessarily use a lot of products
multiple days in a row but I did not
want to stop using this one this is a
gorgeous concealer I was super impressed
the other product I have from number 7
is a bronzer and ho-ho my goodness
gracious this is the caramel bronzer and
this is what the packaging looks like it
was gorgeous like I opened it up it was
like oh oh it's just so pretty and I'm
so excited to say that I have been using
the crap out of this and the little
pretty design is not going anywhere so
I'm like oh the little things in life
this is a stunning bronzer it's kind of
on the lighter side but it's super easy
and quick to build up if you want a bit
of a darker bronzer but it's of course
it has a beautiful finish and I just I
cannot stop reaching for this I love
that has a little mirror in here too
looks guys just been one of my new best
friend I'm so impressed with this I
can't wait to try more from number 7 I
was talking about on my snapchat the
other day and a lot of people recommend
at their foundation I did not get sent
around a ssin but I believe you can buy
number 7 at Target
and I said the next time I go to my
target I'm swapping with a beauty
section and I'm picking up a foundation
because I'm super excited really happy
to find a new brand that I absolutely
love so I'll let you guys know how I
like the foundation that I pick up but
the concealer and browser so far have
been absolute saves of mine a couple
different eyeliners to talk about one I
just went on a roll about this on my
snapchat the other day this is from the
brand DHC and it's their liquid eyeliner
and holy craps have I fallen in love
with this
I love eyeliner I'm a big eyeliner
person and when I find a good liquid
eyeliner it is like we are going to be
together forever a super super fine tip
on it it makes creating wings so easy I
cannot use a different liner pen
I'll leave the DHD website listed down
below I also found these on Amazon so
I'll leave that down there too
this was sent to me actually with like a
ton of skincare from DHC and then just
like randomly there was an eyeliner pen
thrown in there and so I kind of forgot
about it until I was clearing out that
box with all like the skincare like
boxes and everything to throw away and I
found this eyeliner and I was like what
the heck you know one good eyeliner I'll
just give it a try and I was like why
why have you been sitting in a box for
two months why what did I do wrong for
you I just devastated with myself
amazing eyeliner pencil or eyeliners
that I want to talk about everyone's
memorizing bottom and for a very good
reason it's being Marc Jacobs eyeliner
eyeliners woah so I had a couple sent to
me and Lisa and she let me try them out
and like thanks Lisa now you may even go
buy anymore
like are we friends yes yes we are
friend this was the first one that I
tried it's in the shade oh shoot in the
shade Odyssey and it's such a beautiful
blue it's got a bit of shimmer to it
like a teal blue and in the Sephora VAD
sale I went and picked up a green it's
kind of a shimmer green to it and this
is in the shade over and I absolutely
love this actually just wore it last
night when I went to the chainsmokers
concert and it is freaking gorgeous I
also have another one in orange I can't
remember the name of it right now but
these eyeliners are amazing they're very
creamy
they're easy to put on super pigmented
but they stay in that water time they
say it's like one of those things where
I have to like almost a pulldown my eye
and take the makeup lip and rub it right
on my waterline which is super creepy
but sometimes you have to do that
because these suckers do not come off I
absolutely love these highlighters I
wish I had like every single color
available because they're just amazing
so the Marc Jacobs highlighters are
totally totally worth all the hypes are
getting a few more items from the
Sephora VIP feel that I picked up that I
want touch on because like they became
instant favorites of mine I do plan on
doing a follow up haul video after I've
tried out a few more products so I'll
probably touch on these again in that
haul video but I wanted to give them a
quick shout out because I've just been
absolutely loving on them the first one
is the cap on the everlasting a liquid
lipstick this is in ludwig i think it's
like that a your lips the better type of
color like it is so so stunning i'll try
to do a swatch on my crazy looking hand
now because of that smashbox one so
there is a thought of ludwig i really
enjoy the formula of kat von d's there
are a thinner type of a liquid lipstick
but they're also very long-lasting and i
just the colors are so beautiful I'm so
happy with Ludwig I think it is gorgeous
item that I want to shout out was the
Tarte rainforest of the sea foundation
oh I like I'm adoring this foundation I
love the way it feels on the skin it's
very lightweight but it gives like a
medium type of coverage it's very
liquidy but it's not hard at all to
blend out the dropper is a little bit on
the interesting side I don't know if I'd
like necessarily absolutely a hundred
percent full of the dropper but it's
fine and it'll do I've just been super
impressed with this this is a foundation
definitely that I put it on and I just
feel like my face will look better and I
just yes this one it was a big hit for
me I cannot stop wearing this really
enjoying this really happy I got it the
next two items I have our from lorac
lorac did send me their Pirates of the
Caribbean collection which was
mind-boggling I do have a full video on
it below but in that video I feel like
you could see how excited I was for this
eyeshadow palette I was super impressed
with it when I did my first impression
and tried it on but I adore this
Hallett and it is so pretty like I wish
I could do three different makeup looks
in one day because of the eyeshadow
palettes that I've been getting lately
I've just been so impressed with I've
used this palette I think four more
times now since getting it it's because
I just don't want to put it down there's
so many different color combinations in
here and all of the shades are so so
gorgeous that they'll impress with it
you guys are still kind of on the fence
about it like I say go for it
I loved it again you can watch that
video and see my reaction it has no
bearing that lorac sent this to me I
just love this palette and it inspires
me and I'll be honest I didn't think
this would be a favorite of mine and in
the video I even said that you know
definitely the eyeshadow palette would
be the first thing I'd recommend but
then I was like you know what if that
cheat palette is actually really good
too and then since then there's been so
many times that I have been reaching for
it I didn't think that I would love it
as much as I did but I know when I
continually want to use something and
I'm reaching for it ends like I need
blush the first thing that pops in my
mind is that I want to use my lorac
palette that means it is a favorite of
mine so this cheek palette I think is
really freaking good I have been really
loving this Caribbean blush the one in
the middle
it's a beautiful it's mommy Rose blush
and I didn't think it is gorgeous but
these highlighters are stealing the show
man these highlighters are really really
freaking good they're super soft they
don't show a lot of texture but they
still give you intense pop and payoff
highlight again I did not think this
would be a favorite of mine but I keep
reaching for it I love that there's a
little mirror in here so like I would
probably want to travel a little sell it
because I think it's pretty darn good I
have a couple items here that I actually
mentioned in a recent a follow up haul
video haul follow-up video so if you
want to see that video I will leave it
listed down below because I go way more
in depth about these but I have to touch
on them in my favorites video because it
wouldn't be right if I didn't mention
them one is this Tarte make believe in
yourself palette so I I love this
palette and it wasn't sure if it would
be a favorite of mine or if it would go
into the fine category except like oh
you know how how well am I going to get
along with this palette but I just adore
this this was sent to me from my friend
Lisa
who is just absolutely an amazing human
and I'm just so excited that I was able
to try this out because I think it is so
good now I do not think this is for
everybody if you do not like shimmer
looks if you don't like like metallic or
foiled eyeshadows then don't bite this
palette because you're definitely not
going to like it there's only one matte
shade in here all the other ones are
shimmers but I absolutely love the
shimmer shade I've been having really
good luck with this eyeshadow palette I
don't have problems with fallout or pore
pigmentation or anything like that
I've been really happy with it really
reaching for it a lot turn makes
believing yourself if you like these
kind of shades I say go for it
other eyeshadow palette I have on my
eyes right now and you just can't stop I
can't stop using it guys
it is the violet boss Holy Grail I
shadow palette I just love it my
beautiful friend of Michelle's emphysema
and being am I just like so thankful it
opened it up and like it was a love at
first sight we had an immediate deep
connection and I just knew I was going
to love it and I do like I said it is
what it's on my eyes right now
I just I love these shades I think they
are beautiful I love the beautiful
bronze in here I've done it all matte
Brown I look like this I have the
tutorial in Instagram I've done
something more with the cranberry colors
on here I believe that tutorials on
Instagram as well I do all of my makeup
tutorials but like 99% of my makeup
tutorials on Instagram versus here on
YouTube because I like to talk on
YouTube and it's easier to show
tutorials on Instagram so if you're not
following over there a March Beauty word
and that's where you'll get my tutorials
but just all of the different shades are
just gorgeous you can do so many
different things with this palette from
mask to shimmers to a mixture and again
I just can't stop wearing it I think
it's beautiful they blend well they're
super pigmented not a lot of fall out
I've been so happy with this palette
items I want to mention that was
featured in the follow up video is the
Smashbox and Casey Holmes collaboration
and I got mine in Pearl I love this
palette first shade which I thought
obviously was going to be like my least
favorite shade is my favorite I love it
I love it alone I love it at the topper
not only for these other two shades in
here but for my other highlights I put a
highlight on and on
like just not feeling it enough I come
into this palette and grab out that
first shade this is a beautiful
beautiful palette again - in the pearl
shade I love that there's the mirror in
there as well like I'm just super
