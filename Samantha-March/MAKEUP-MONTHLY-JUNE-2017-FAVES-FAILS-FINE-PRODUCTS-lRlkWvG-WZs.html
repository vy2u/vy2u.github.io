today's video is finally going to be
mine makeup monthly for the month of
June so in my makeup monthly videos
basically they kind of replace my
favorites videos because I'm going to be
talking about not only my favorites for
the month and my sales but I'm also
talking about the products that I
thought were just fine I started just a
couple months ago as basically a way to
be able to review more products in my
monthly favorites videos because some
products don't fall under our favorite
some pride films fall under a fail but
they're kind of in between
you still like them you just can't
categorize some of the favorite so that
is why I started doing my makeup monthly
so I have a lot of items here that I'm
going to be talking you through why I
love them
why I did not love them and why I
thought that they were pretty good so
before we get started I wanna say thank
you so much for clicking on this video
if you have not subscribed yet I hope
that you will consider hitting the
subscribe button as of right now I am
posting every single day so if you love
getting daily content you'll be getting
that from me because there's just so
much to talk about so if you love
chatter about makeup I hope that you
will hit the subscribe button before you
leave but why don't we go ahead and get
started with my June make it monthly
alright so first I'm going to talk about
some of the products that I thought
we're just fine
so again obviously didn't hate them but
they weren't favorites favorites Bills
out they were good products and I still
would want to mention them to you so
first one is a mascara this is from
julep and it's there with a twist
lash boosting bamboo mascara so this is
what the outer packaging looks like I
think it is super cute Sin Cara
definitely has a lot of claims it's made
with bamboo it's supposed to lengthen
and create fullness with your lashes it
does have an interesting wand so this is
what the wand looks like and you might
think that looks like a pretty standard
mascara wand has this little twist cap
at the top as well and I don't know if
the camera would be able to pick it out
but basically when you twist it back and
forth it changes the shape of the wand
so you're supposed to be able to twist
it one way and it focuses on length and
then you twist the opposite way and it
focuses on fullness for your lashes so
you can twist back and forth and kind of
get a two-in-one mascara and this also
have a clinical plan such as if you use
it for 15 days straight you're supposed
to be able to notice a fullness to your
lashes even without the mascara I did
get this to review
from preen dot me which is similar to
like an influencer if you would be
familiar with that but basically is for
like beauty bloggers to be able to apply
to campaigns to get products to review
so I do think this is a good mascara
I'll be honest that I'm not a big
mascara person because I do wear false
lashes alas it'll last even on non
following days or anything I just prefer
to wear false lashes it's easier for me
than applying mascara cuz I feel like
mascara can take forever if you have
short lashes like me trying to build
them up like it's just quicker for me to
put a latch on to be honest but I did
like this mascara I thought it was an
interesting concept with the twist and
wasn't like life-changing to me and it
wasn't something like I don't feel like
I could wear this mascara if I'm going
out and I'm not wearing false lashes
which isn't super often I have those
mascaras that I feel like just really
make my lashes look really good and this
was just like a good one for me it just
wasn't overwhelming but I still didn't
like it I didn't think it was like
absolute crap and it didn't work at all
I still thought this was a good mascara
so this is the julep with a twist the
next two products I have are actually
ones that I use together so it's going
to grab them together but one of them is
the Tarte clay stick foundation did do a
review of this one so I'll leave it link
down below and I mentioned in my review
that I just wasn't a really big fan of
it I said that I didn't hate it like I
wasn't going to return it I was going to
keep playing around with it to see like
if I could make it work for me the
problem that I was having with it was
that it just didn't really do much for
my skin
it didn't make my skin look particularly
healthy or flawless or do er glowy or
just you know anything like that it just
kind of looked a bit flat on my face
I liked that it was creamy I like though
is easy to apply I do like six
foundations I think they're convenient I
did also say that this was very
long-lasting and I still definitely do
agree with that I just it just didn't do
much for like my actual complexion when
I kept playing with it I kept trying it
and I finally figured out that I don't
like to wear this on its own and what I
like to wear it with is this pure bronze
your selfie so this is a skin perfecting
face and body liquid bronzer so this is
what the outer packaging looks like this
one was sent to me from Pierre I did buy
the foundation but basically it is just
a
a liquid bronzer but this I like I don't
love it I'm not like super overwhelmed
they don't need to wear it every day
especially because I've been outside a
lot lately so I have a tan all on its
own because I've been spending so much
time outdoors so before I was really
getting outdoorsy this summer I kept
reaching for this to mix in with my
foundations because I just think it's
really pretty against the skin a nice
healthy glow so when I mix this what's
the Tarte foundation unlike ahh v2 these
two go together really well so since
then I actually really like this pairing
together
I still can't put either one in a
favorites category because I can't wear
this foundation on its own feel like the
long-lasting especially in the summer it
keeps up against the heat really well
and then paired with this I just think
like it it makes my face look so pretty
so healthy bit dewy I just I really like
these together again I don't wear this
on its own a ton especially not since
I'm canary don't necessarily need it but
mixing it in with the foundation
especially if you have a foundation that
maybe it's too late for you especially
if it is summer for you and you have a
bit of a tan and maybe your favorite
foundation is in a shape match now this
could be a good option because this is a
little bit too light for me but this is
a good option to mix in with those
lighter foundations and I really like
the way it makes the face look so the
Tarte classic foundation and the pure
bronze your selfies them both a lot so I
definitely wanted to mention them in my
sign category and give that you guys a
bit of an update on how I finally made
the dart sticks foundation or for me my
fans that I want to mention in defined
category is an eyeshadow palette this is
from Chris Anna and cosmetics and it is
the olympus eyeshadow palette so this is
let's packaging looks like and then when
you open it up you have 15 different
shades and they're in matte and shimmers
and i like this here because it has the
different shade names on it and it kind
of gives you a little like short idea i
thought that was a really good idea I
was really appreciative of that I have
been trying out Christian and cosmetics
for quite some time now she actually
found me on Instagram and first is sent
me her liquid lipsticks which I really
do like I have quite a few of them I was
wearing both the olympus palette and one
of her liquid lipsticks in gold AF in my
summer bucket list video so i can leave
that link down below if you guys would
want to check it out i'll also have an
our tutorial it should be out by the
time this video goes up but if it's not
I'm just merged beauty word I do post
quickly tutorials over there I really do
like this eye shadow pellet I want to be
able to classify it as a favorite but
it's definitely not a failed to me and I
do think it's a really good eye shadow
palette and it's only $20 for the 15
shades like I said you have some math in
here and then also some shimmers been
able to try out quite a few of the
shimmer so far the maths are really
pretty some of the shades are just a
little bit hidden missing here looks
like some performs better on the eyes
than the others but for the majority I
think this is a really good eye shadow
pellet I think the shades looked really
nice on the eyes and they're very easy
to work with and there's very little
fall out which I did appreciate as well
and for only $20 I did not think that
was a bad price I also love finding like
makeup entrepreneurs girl bosses to be
able to support and I definitely do
support Christian again cosmetics I do
really like for liquid lipstick urban
and actually reach out to me recently
and gave me a discount code as well so I
do have one it's just marched Beauty for
15% off anything on our website so that
will be linked down below of course as
well as her website and also per
Instagram I want to mention the Olympus
palace in this video because I have been
using it recently and I've been very
impressed with it and I think this is a
pretty good up-and-coming brand so I
think that you guys should check it out
so I just have a few products to talk
about in my fale category so that's
pretty exciting the first one is a
liquid eyeliner this is from La Bella
Donna this is what the eyeliner looks
like and I use this in my makeup step
roulette video so I'll have that link
down below if you want to see me use it
I tried it out for the first time in
that video and I think you could kind of
tell my reaction I was like oh this is
not going well I've tried it out a few
more times since then just because you
know sometimes I'm doing makeup on
camera it's not the easiest because I'm
holding a mirror the whole time I'm
doing my makeup I don't have a table or
anything in front of me hang it more and
I just really don't like it and I feel
bad because LaBella dad did send this to
me they send me some other products too
and unfortunately most of them have been
missed for me which really stinks I mean
I hate when that happens
but I will also be truthful and
unfortunately the liquid eyeliner also
did not work for me it was very hard
like the tip of it is very very hard on
the eyes like it actually kind of hurt
my eyes
I kept making the line which wasn't good
it's also like very patching just kind
of like skips across the eye instead of
being able to make one smooth line it's
like this is also $25 which i think is
really expensive for what it is and it
just it didn't work out for me so
unfortunately this was a Miss and the
month of June other product that was a
fail for me might not be a surprised if
you guys saw my Urban Decay make a heat
review video is everybody can make a
heat pellet I cannot show you the
palette because I returned it to Sephora
I ended up returning it because it just
wasn't for me again I can leave my
review video linked down below I
mentioned in there it wasn't a bad
palette all around but it just wasn't
going to fit for me especially because I
have so many palettes and I especially
because I had so many palettes that were
comparable to that palette it just
didn't make sense to keep it in my
collection I didn't want to say in the
video I know I totally made it sound
like I only tried that palette with the
brush that came with it and as the
comments were coming in I replayed the
video because I like did I like really
try to make it come across but I only
use that brush and I totally did which
was not the case I would never only try
one brush was a palette it just doesn't
even make sense
so I was trying to answer some of the
comments of like know I did try other
brushes as well and I did mention in the
video that with the math I was like I
even tried my other blending brushes and
it still just wasn't working out for me
but I did try all of my own makeup
brushes that I loved very much with that
palette as well and the shimmers just
really didn't show up without some sort
of like liquid mac fix+
using them and the math I mean not all
the maps were bad I thought the match
were definitely better than the shimmers
in the palette but they still weren't
like blending out miraculously or doing
anything crazy even look like my Sigma
e-40 or things like that
so I did want to mention that cuz I know
it probably sounded really confusing
when I filmed that video I had an hour
and five minutes of footage that I tried
to cut down and when I first did it it
was still at 35 minutes and I chopped
even more to get it down to like the 20
minutes or whatever it was so I know I
was like cutting here and there and I
cut out the parts for I mentioned to
using the other brushes so I did want to
mention that because I know I got some
not like why would you only use one
brush with a pellet that was not the
case the brush I did not like with the
pellet either but it's because I have so
many comparable to that palette like
what I showed in the video I do
comparable swatches as well and then
just the $54 price tag when I'm trying
to save my money up for some other
things right now in my beauty lish order
it just didn't make sense for me to keep
it so I did end up returning Zarate
ticket heat what was amiss for me in the
month of June which was such a bummer
because I was so excited about that
palette but that's okay there's more
eyeshadow palettes out there
I'm moving along to my favorite products
of June the first time to talk about are
going to be no surprise I have a whole
video review on these it is from a dose
of colors the first item is the
marvellous mob eyeshadow palette hello I
love this palette so much it has these
five different shades here all in the
mob shade range it has a mirror it has a
little double ended brush as well this
is $32 I picked my nose from also a dose
of colors is now being sold at Ulta
online and I've been having a fantastic
time at this I keep recommending it I
get a lot of questions of what cool
toned eyeshadow palette I recommend
since you know warm tones are all the
rage right now if you like cool tones
and you like mob I think that you would
really love this eyeshadow palette and
the other one from dose of colors that I
can stop wearing taking with me it's in
my purse at all times is there liquid
lipstick in stone I love this shade so
much again I think the full review video
tutorial you see this on my lips in that
video so I'll have it linked down below
but their liquid lipsticks are so good
and if you love the malls like dusty
rose type of lipsticks you will
absolutely love stone to list 6 our $18
like I said you can get them and also
which i think is really nice so you can
use some points I'll have dose of colors
and also listed down below their liquid
lipsticks are really good if you aren't
following me yet on instagrams l12
because my 20k giveaway is going up over
there and you will see some dose of
colors in that giveaway but yes both of
these I would highly highly recommend
from dose of colors this might be one of
the more random things I'm talking about
in this video but it is an eyeshadow
primer it is from ELF cosmetics and it's
called their shadow lock eyelid primer
it doesn't have the
name on the bottle so I had to double
check that I'm getting it right you can
find this at Ulta it is two dollars to
two dollars for this and I see this is a
phenomenal eyeshadow primer and I
personally don't really like eyeshadow
primers I've tried out a lot I've tried
the Smashbox I've tried the lorac and I
find them to be fine but nothing crazy a
lot of times I'm mostly just using my
concealers because I feel as the
concealers do a way better job but this
is actually a where we could I shadow
primer and it's made me really excited
and it was something that I didn't even
realize how much I was loving until
every single day when I was doing my
eyeshadows I was like where's my ELF
primer where's my alzheimer I need my
ELF primer I can't use my shows with on
my ELF primer it's really really good I
feel like I don't have any issues with
creasing which I know sometimes people
can say they'll have issues with
creasing if they try to use their
concealers I don't find any creasing
issues I useless and you know spread it
on my eyelid I said it like I would
normally do I don't have any issues with
it but I also like because it almost has
like a peachy salmon tint to it so it
also tends color correcting the eyelids
I don't have any ton of pigmentation on
my eyes but sometimes I can definitely
have like the little veins that peek
through and that's why another reason I
think why I like using the concealer
because that covers it up more where I
don't feel like the lorac or the
Smashbox 24 hour primer I don't feel
like either as always cover up any
redness you might have or pigmentation
are veins and this one does so I've been
loving it and again it's two dollars two
dollars like I don't even know how and
go wrong with that the next time I
purchase anything from also even if I'm
not done with this yet I'm just going to
put this on my cart because why wasn't I
it's become like my favorite eyeshadow
primer so there you go elf nailed it so
this next product should also come as no
surprise I did a full video review of it
and I also did a makeup tutorial with it
and I'm saying how much I love it it is
the ejectment hill and morphe brushes
eyeshadow palette man you guys this is a
good palette and I don't care about any
of the controversy or drama or whatever
other people want to say or get mad at
this is a really freaking good I shadow
palette and I am just seriously
impressed with it it is out of stock
right now but I am hoping that the
restock
date is coming soon as the ten minutes
only they haven't announced a recite a
but she keeps saying soon soon soon and
I'm like how soon because I want
everybody who wants this tell it to get
this palette because I have just been
loving it I have done a lot of new
eyeshadow house recently to review and
try out and it seriously like pains me
because I want to use this one because
there's so many more color combinations
that I want to try there's so many
beautiful shades in here that I just
want all over my eyes it is such a
beautiful palette I was very impressed
with most of the shades like I said in
my review videos not every single shade
and acts it out of the park there's a
few shades that I will not use but the
shades that I love I just absolutely
love and this palette inspires me to
create makeup look I've really been
loving it I mean I don't know if you can
tell like how dirty it is because I have
really been putting it to use but I am
really loving on this palette is $38 so
I know it it's a little bit more
expensive for an eyeshadow palette where
you are getting 35 shades and I do think
that they are really good
oh yes be more features and helped
palette I do give it my complete same
approval I'll have my videos on this
palette listed down below if you want to
check out my full review and my makeup
tutorial but I still stand by this
palette and I was still recommended but
next time I want to talk about a
fragrance and this is so surprising to
me that I am finding so many perfumes
and fragrances that I've really been
loving I've never been much for a
fragrance person and I think I can blame
scent bird because once I started
getting scent bird doesn't monthly
scents that you get I've just been
finding so many more like I think I've
been realizing what it is that I like in
a perfume and I've been able to like
hone in on that and I just been finding
more and more perfume lately that I
really really love this one was sent to
me by the company to find me but once I
mean if you saw me on snap I pulled it
out and showed you guys for the first
time and then I sprayed it and then I
came back and was like wait a second I
really like that and I keep wearing it
this has been giving my kendall flower
perfume a serious run for its money I
was out all weekend and every single day
I wore this over my Kenzel which is like
shocking to me but the brain is called
define me and the scent that they sent
me the scent that they sent me is
Delphine they do have other scents
available as well and these can be found
at Ulta Beauty so for adults unit comes
in
little box like this so this one has
lots of lilac freesia lang lang not sure
if I'm saying that correctly coconut and
rosewood and I think it's really cute
because on the back - it says Delphine
is an artistic creative soul who
radiates an effortless elegance and I'm
like oh there's like totally me in a
bottle I love it but I also thought I
was really close does every bottle of
define me fragrance represents mold
breaking barrier crushing women the
sweets of qualities we strive for for
being confident strong creative
free-spirited loving passionate grateful
and fearless and for every bottle
purchase one dollar goes to scholarships
for girls so I thought that was really
cool and I love being able to find
companies our branch that also like
gifts back in some sort of way like this
so I got even more excited when I saw
this I immediately like in their little
note it said they're available at Ulta I
immediately went on Aalto website I put
out a tweet about it right away that's
how excited I was over a fragrance which
is something strange to me because I
normally don't get excited about those
kind of things but I also think this
bottle is super super cute I have it on
my desk next to my Kendall perfume I
love the fragrance I like really light
sense like you know you can still tell
that you're wearing a perfume but it's
not overwhelming it's not like you know
what I'm saying
this one has definitely I've just been
loving it so I'll have it linked down
below as well as ts- and Delphine and if
you like like fresh sense this would be
a good one for you so next time I have
some skincare that I want to talk about
and these are from milk makeup I know
the matcha cleanser and nacho toner
we're getting a lot of hype and I
actually got they sent to me from milk
which was super cool because I was
thinking about picking up the toner for
some reason the toner caught my eye over
the cleanser I'm really not even sure
why maybe I don't have a ton of toners
but I was planning on picking it up to
try it out and then we actually got sent
all three of them I was like well okay
that's amazing and of course with all of
my review videos it doesn't have any
bearing on it if something gets sent to
me or not I've mentioned products in the
fine category and also the fail category
of this video that were sent to me so I
know barring so let's move on but I have
really been loving both of these I've
recently started trying out this but the
matcha cleanser and toner I have been
having such a good time with one thing
that I think that I really
about it - is the packaging and the
convenience factor I have been doing a
lot of traveling and these are what I am
taking with me because they're so easy
to throw in my bag I'm not worrying
about them opening it doesn't have like
a pump on it like you know some
cleansers do that you just can't travel
with because they'll be public funds are
all over your bag like that's not cool
so I definitely love the packaging of
these but also I just think that they're
really good products I find myself
reaching for them more and more to the
point where I haven't even put them in
I like skincare drawer in my bathroom
they're just sitting out on my sink
which I know it's not good the clutters
up might think but because I'm reaching
for them so much it's just become easier
for me to leave them out so that's when
I know that I've really been loving our
product so first what I do is I go in
with the cleanser I do have a skincare
video on my Instagram that I can leave
link down below but I show a demo of
this but I like the cleanser because it
has these like little beads like little
granules inside so while it's still a
cleanser and it still it's not
irritating at all expect sensitive skin
but it's almost like it's giving you
just a little bit more of a boost as
well and it also smells freaking amazing
that was the first thing I noticed what
I put this on I look wow that smells so
good and then the toner was the other
item that I was really excited for I
cleanse I remove my makeup then I clean
my face and I put the toner on and I
follow with either of my moisturizer or
my night cream depending on what time of
day I'm using these products and I used
the toner so it's the same kind of green
as well obviously there is no like beads
granules and whatnot but yes I have
really been loving on the matcha toner
and cleanser are both at $26 and I know
if you're really into skincare I
definitely am I like skincare like
finding new skincare but if you're
definitely into skincare I would say
check these out because I think they are
really really good also very convenient
to use which I did like I have recently
been trying this guy out too but this is
their hydrating oil and as say I was
kind of worried about using it until I
saw Jam Beauty 89 she reviewed a bunch
of milk products and she talked about
how much she liked this and what I have
found this for is like when I'm outside
all day and I've been in the Sun and
like one day I had not a severe sunburn
but like I could tell my face was a
little bit pink
I used it that night when I woke up my
skin just felt very like
she's almost like that like a cooling
effect that this has going on but my
skin felt like fresh and like hydrated
and you know didn't have like butt
tightness anymore from the sunburn and
then I use it again kind of for the same
reason and I feel like it really does
help so it's not something that I would
use every night or anything like that
like maybe once a week I throw it in
there sell this one I mean these two are
definitely like favorite favorites and
this one I'm still you know kind of in
the new stages of testing out but I
wanted to mention it too except really
been getting on with it so yeah smells
makeup I mean this is brandon has been
very much impressing me I love how like
innovative and like kind of like unique
their packaging is too so I will have
these three link down below I actually
have a mascara that I have been loving
on which surprises maybe is like I said
earlier I don't wear mascara a ton but
this is my mascara one of the first time
I use it I was like yes I can use this
one I don't want to wear lashes because
it still makes my lashes that look so
good so it's the pure big look mascara I
have a deluxe eyes people because they
came in like a little trio of mascaras
both sides is $21 its essence a
lengthening mascara which I do agree
with but I also think that it helps with
fullness of your lashes too I was very
impressed with it and it's funny because
I've had this for a while but if you've
been watching my vlogs that I am like
cleaning and organizing my makeup
collection I used to just have all of my
mascaras just like clumped in this
little tiny organizer and I basically
would use like the three on top that was
it because I wouldn't want to dig around
for the other one I have since changed
my mascara collection and now they're
all in this little neat section and I
can see all of them and so the other day
I was like oh I have never used this
mascara I should try it out in a boom so
in love with it I look well okay that
was a good decision to organize my
mascara collection because now I found a
new mascara that I love so this is what
the wand looks like and again it's
supposed to be good for lengthening but
I think it's good for both I've been
loving it have had a couple videos
recently wrong not wearing lashes I know
it's been kind of crazy
and in both those videos I have the pure
big look on so if you are looking for a
good mascara for length and volume this
is $21 and pure can also be found at
Ulta so I'll have it linked down below
so I recently discovered a product
that kind of became like a life changer
to me a game-changer it's nice not being
too dramatic but seriously oh my word
I've been a really nice package from
Vito Liberata again it was sent to me
from prenup me so I was doing it to to
review it wasn't just sent in PR it was
I applied to be a part of the campaign
it was sent to me to review and they
came with a couple different items they
came with the ten minutes Han and they
also came with some like face bronzing
powders as well and I liked all of those
just fine I have an Instagram video of
me doing the 10 minute tan I think it's
a really nice tanner this this is on
like a whole new level this is the Vita
Liberata body blur and oh my goodness
I saw Carli bybel talking about it on
her snapchat I think she talked about it
in a video too but she said it really
does blur your skin and she said it even
covers cellulite I was like really
because I have cellulite on the back of
my leg that always really bothers me I'm
very self-conscious like in a swimsuit I
very rarely wear shorts I though when
she said that I was like okay I need to
try it and wow this really does work
and I was super impressed with it I was
telling my friend Shannon about the
other day we went out voting and I was
like dude my legs look better because
what I use and I need to step up on this
like I didn't feel as self-conscious
wearing my swimsuit in front of my
friends so it says it's an instant HD
skin finish 24-hour wear and I have been
using the shade medium says it's a
technology that minimizes low muscies
covers imperfections and smooth skin for
hd-ready finish on lens decollete and
the face and there's like I just I'm so
impressed with this I really do think it
covers up the imperfections
I made my legs the back of my legs looks
so much better
I also Bruce really easily and I have a
60-pound left dog who sometimes her
nails like even if she just hits me the
wrong way I will get a really big bruise
it was helping to hide those bruises on
my legs as well I've just been really
really impressed with this I like I said
like I want to stock up being a Liberata
can also be found at Sephora hi blur is
$45 and it's for three point three eight
fluid ounces so far I've really been
only using it for the backs of my legs
and then the front
my life if I did have any bruising that
I wanted to cover so I think that this
bottle can last me for a very long time
but I definitely want more of these
because this really was especially for
the summer like this was like a game
changer for me so I've been really
really excited to try out this body blur
and fall in love with them
I guess so that's going to be everything
