today's video it's going to be all about
makeup products that I did not think I
was going to enjoy but I ended up really
liking I've had this one on my list for
a while it's been inspired by some
foundations that I've been talking about
recently in videos and I kept finding
myself saying I did think I would enjoy
it for you know X Y &amp;amp; Z reason but I
ended up really enjoying it so I wanted
to go through my collection and pull out
some of the products that I really
thought I would not enjoy especially as
much as I ended up liking them I know I
did see my friend that live from live
loves her makeup post a video very
similar to this just a couple days ago I
think she called it makeup she was
hesitant to buy but she's glad that she
did so if you like this style of video
and you would want to see another one I
will have a lives video also linked it
down below in the description box
because that was a fun one as well but
if you want to see if some of the
products that I really did not think I
would enjoy this much why don't we go
ahead and get started
hey so like I said it was inspired by
especially these two foundations in a
particular and the first one here is
from Laura Mercier it's the flawless a
fusion ultra long wear foundation I just
have a little sample size of this and I
got it because I was hearing so many
people say really good things about this
foundation and I was like I want to try
it because I love foundation I love
trying foundations but I was like I
don't know it's ultra long wear which
means it's really full coverage I don't
love full coverage so I was like well
I'll just get a little sample guy of it
and see what I think I think this was
either like a not a point perk I think
it was one of like the weekly specials
that Sephora does are the beauty offers
I think is what they're called and you
just have a code and you can get it that
way it so that's what I did and I want
to say I got the shade buff it doesn't
say on here I think it's the shade buff
though and I was like I'll just give it
a try and see what everybody is raving
about and I ended up really enjoying it
so I kept mentioning this in a couple
like follow-up videos and I was like I
really did not think I ever to enjoy
this foundation but it ended up really
surprising me it definitely is very full
coverage when I am applying this one
it's like you're putting on a whole
nother face which is kind of crazy to me
but it didn't feel like too suffocating
sometimes with full coverage foundations
like I feel like my skin just can't
breathe and all I can think about is
like oh what's going on underneath that
makeup but it doesn't feel too
heavy on the skin it doesn't look cakey
in any areas and I really can wear this
the entire day I remember once wearing
this in the summer when I played Santa
volleyball and I wore it to volleyball
and I was thinking like this is a really
bad idea my face is gonna feel so
disgusting afterwards I'm gonna look
crazy and know there's no adverse
effects at all so I actually ended up
really enjoying this foundation way more
than I thought I was going to and I
ended up putting a full-size of this one
on my current Sephora love's list it's
still sitting there because yeah I ended
up really liking this one so it's very
surprised about that and then the other
foundation that I was like man again
it's full coverage I just don't know
that's not always my cup of tea but I
kind of want to give it a try because I
hear good things about this one as well
this is the Urban Decay all nighter
foundation I did order this one at from
my actally store I was really excited
that I was able to order from actally I
always have my octoly link down below if
you're a blogger you can request a
products to review from Brants which is
really amazing and I was really excited
when Urban Decay showed up in there so I
was able to test out the all nighter
waterproof along where liquid foundation
again it's just the same thing as the
Laura Mercier because I know my
preference is not a super full coverage
foundation it was just in my mind like
you know what you're probably not gonna
get as much use out of this one you're
probably not gonna love it and I
actually really enjoy it I was just
wearing it the other day as well and I
think it is so good I do like to pair it
with you know a really hydrating primer
or to use some sort of like facial oil
before I apply this one but honestly I
think it's really nice I also like to
apply with the beauty sponge because it
just kind of like it bumps down the
full-coverage it's just a tiny bit if
you use it with a damp sponge but I
really like the way it looks on my skin
I think it just makes everything look so
smooth and so flawless it's definitely
very long wearing I want to say this is
the foundation that I wore and New
Year's Eve I think it was very very long
wearing foundation and again just like
with the Laura Mercier doesn't feel too
heavy doesn't kick up weird doesn't do
weird things on the lines in my face so
I really like this one too my shade that
I have in this one is a 4.5 and then I
have some eye shadow pellets here that's
I I was super surprised at how much I
ended up enjoying both of these the
first one here is the Kat Von D Saint
and sinner eyes shadow palette
now my friend live it did send this one
to me and I thought it was so cool and
her note when she was letting me know
that she was sending this to me she goes
I just feel like you would really like
this palette and I'm like really I'm not
sure because kind of when I looked at it
I I say a lot in my videos I don't have
like an artistically creative mind I'm a
creative person but not artistically
creative if that makes sense
and kind of looking at this I'm kind of
like what is it that I'm supposed to do
again with this palette and I know I've
seen people do pounding it and
rearranging it and I think that's
awesome but I feel like once I got over
kind of like that mental roadblock with
this palette but once I glanced at it
what I kind of do with this palette is I
pick out what is like the one the one
shade in here like do I want to do the
blue or the teal or the purple or the
shimmer like I kind of pick out my Lynch
shade first and then it's really easy to
build from there because this is
actually a very all-inclusive palette I
mean you have transition shades light
shades deep shades shimmer shades
colorful shades neutral shades you have
topper shades up here I mean you have a
vast majority of shades to play with and
all kinds of different looks that you
can create with this one and the shadows
are really nice I do like Kat Von D
eyeshadows and I think that these ones
are really good as well I will say not
every shade in here was like an absolute
knocked it out of the park for me
amazing there are a few shades that I
don't think perform as well as the
others but especially for the shades
that I love and then I reach for with
this palette I'm having a great time
with it and I was so surprised still
surprised so I don't know how I've knew
me better than I knew myself with this
palette but I'm so happy that she sent
this to me because I get a lot of use
out of this one and I did not see that
coming another palette that I absolutely
enjoy and I say so many good things
about is the Urban Decay heavy metal
eyes shadow palette this was a part of
their holiday release and I did talk
about this one in a wilayat video and I
was like you know what I'm interested in
it and I think it looks good but I don't
go for all shimmer palettes a ton so it
wouldn't make sense for me to spend I
think it's in the $50 range I was like
it does it wouldn't make sense for me to
spend that type of money when I know I
tend to reach for something that's more
all-inclusive like the Kat Von D it just
wouldn't be a wise purchase for me I
ended up getting it in PR which I was so
excited about
I did recently put this one in my beauty
battle video and I did talk about the
packaging it's a little the packaging is
a little bit on the interesting side but
the actual palette itself Wow I I did
not think that I would enjoy it this
much and not even just because it's an
all shimmer shade I just was kind of
like I don't know how many looks can I
actually create with it I kind of on
first glance when I looked at the photos
especially over here I'm like a lot of
those shades look so similar to one
another like would I really get a good
amount of use out of this one and oh my
goodness yes is the answer I love this
palette so much and I reach for it 800
ad I really love to create halo eyes
with this palette and just do an all
shimmer kind of halo eye look I think
it's gorgeous but even you know I can
use something like the Kat Von D shade
in light or just any sort of pellet out
there and start to create a look and
then come in here and grab up any of
these beautiful shimmer shades I love
that every shade really performs so well
and you just have such a variety of
colors from the warm tones to the cool
tones the neutrals the more pops of
colors I get a lot of use out of this
palette and I honestly did not see that
one coming
I did not think that I would love it as
much as I did so and next up I have some
glitters here to talk about and these
are from Stila and these are their
magnificent methyls glitter and glow
liquid eyeshadows okay so with these I
remember I put him in a while I buy a
video and I was like I'm super
interested in these and they look really
cool but there are 24 dollars each
that's really expensive
I don't wear glitter a lot I'm probably
not gonna get them and then I felt like
I kept putting them in other videos like
I kind of wish I would have bought this
but then I didn't and I think I maybe
put it in like my support vib sale like
wishlist video like maybe I'll get the
glitters and a discount but then I
didn't do it and that I just kept having
like the hardest time with these I was
like I want them but are they truly
worth of the twenty-four dollars I might
actually negate use out of them I also
have sensitive eyes so not all glitters
play well with my eyes and I can get a
lot of like burning and it just it
doesn't work I had to immediately remove
the glitter so I was like I don't know
what to do even though I know that I
could order these from Sephora Ulta and
return them if it didn't work out for me
but I
you know sometimes I just want to be a
little bit more confident in my shopping
purchases so I didn't know what to do
and then I had a subscriber send me a
handful of these and I was like no way
Dimitra get down with your bad self
because I can't believe that you just
did that and then I said Dimitra now I
love these so what did you just do to me
these I I'm so so surprised that I love
them so much and almost every time you
see me wearing glitter on my eyes like
an all glitter look is the Stila
glitters I've tried out I'm fairly
confident I tried out every single shade
that she sent me I really love kind of
like the neutrally ones and the ones I
have on top here were smoldering satin
and rose gold retro I know I love the
Khitan caramel one but I've also done
the ones that are a little bit more are
they called like the duo chrome ones or
something like that like mermaid tail or
something with a mermaid sea siren maybe
is what it is that one is freaking
gorgeous I mean these are so nice they
don't burn my eyes at all the
application can be a little bit tricky
and I just say if you are applying them
make sure doing any like manipulation of
the glitter before it dries because once
it dries and you try to blend or just
move the glitter around at all it will
fall out onto your face so you just want
to work with it while it's wet but
otherwise I love these and I think
they're totally worth it and I enjoyed
them so much I always get compliments on
them when I wear this on my eyes so
that's pretty bomb next up here I have
an oil a face oil and this is from afar
Sally and it's the rose gold elixir I
definitely did not think that I would
grow to love this one as much as I did
definitely kind of wondered if this
would just be like an Instagram type
thing but I use this so much especially
I enjoy pairing this with a more full
coverage foundation just make sure my
skin is like just prepped and ready for
that full coverage miss of some of the
foundations that I've mentioned and I
still have another foundation to mention
as well but this one is really nice and
especially during the winter time and
like a couple weeks ago when I was going
through my like insane dry patches when
it was so so cold here in Iowa this was
front and center on my desk at all times
I wanted to use it every single day
I've been getting more and more into
facial oils lately and I know maybe just
facial oils as a whole is not something
that I quite realize how much I would
enjoy but as I've been using more I
actually do see the benefits for my face
when I do use them but yeah this one I
wondered if it was just hype but I'm
totally down with it it might actually
did put the unicorn essence the other
one form for Sally I put that on my
Sephora love's list because I'm
interested in that one now as well and I
like that they have minis out now
because those are like $54 and you can
get a mini for 20 and I mean I've had
this for a while and I still even as
much as I use it I probably am still
only halfway down there which I think I
mean that's awesome but you can get mini
now as well and save some money and then
the last item I have here is another
foundation I bought this one myself I
think isn't one of the VIP sales because
it is a pricier foundation this is the
hourglass advantage to stick foundation
everybody was raving about this one at
one point and again it's very full
coverage and it's also a stick
foundation which I don't prefer stick
foundations I've tried other ones I've
tried Lancome I've tried Anastasia I
feel like there was a drugstore one that
I tried as well I'm looking at my
foundation collection if you're like
what is she doing looking at my
foundation collection I thought there
was a drugstore one that I tried to and
it's they're just not my favorite
I just prefer my regular liquid
foundation so I had that kind of doubt
as I was going into it and it was full
coverage and it was pricier and I was
like oh I don't know if I'm actually
going to love this one Wow I've gotten a
lot of use out of this and I think it's
really nice I believe my shade yeah is
in nude and it is just really nice I
honestly love pairing it with the Far
Sally I don't know if I ever wear this
one without wearing the first dolly like
these two are just like a perfect match
for me
I was just wearing this combination the
other week as well creamy foundation it
feels really nice on the skin and it's
super easy to blend out I prefer using a
Beauty Blender with this one as well or
makeup sponge with this one but again it
looks really nice it's full coverage and
I out of the other two that I was
talking about I think maybe this one I
feel like it goes laura mercier urban
decay in an hourglass if I were like
rating them because it's just like a
just a little bit more full full
coverage than the
there too but I still really like it and
I still think it makes the skin look
really well and I was just surprised
between between it being a stick
Foundation and between it being full
coverage and knowing how much I was
paying for it I was like you know I just
don't know if I'm gonna enjoy this one
and I'm actually really surprised how
much I did but yeah I am really happy
with this one it from hourglass as well
but after that that is going to do it
for the makeup that I did not think I
would love as much as I did okay so
that's gonna be everything for today's
video I hope you enjoyed seeing some of
the products that kind of didn't think
it would work out as well as they did
for me but I'm very happy about it
it's kind of exciting when that happens
right it's a good feeling I'd love to
know some of yours in the comments down
below what is something that you thought
maybe would not work for you and you
ended up enjoying it so much again like
I said live does have a similar video to
this one as well so that will be in the
description box if you want to watch
another video similar in content to this
one but if you guys did enjoy this video
I hope that you will give it a thumbs up
I hope that you also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys in tomorrow's video right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
