today's video is going to be all about a
makeup products that I wish I had
purchased sooner a lot of these items
that I'm going to mention in here our
items that were continually recommended
to me or I would see them you know being
featured in favorites videos or
tutorials over and over again by other
youtubers and I was like yes I want to
try that but I'm not going to buy quite
yet
and now that I have these products I'm
like shame on you antha you should have
gotten these much much sooner so if you
would like to see them a good product so
that I wish I had bought sooner won't we
go ahead and get started so the first
one I want to talk about is a makeup
product that I just have been
recommending like left and right no one
should be surprised to see this one in
this video this is from Urban Decay it
is the Naked Skin one done hybrid
complexion Perfector okay so this one I
actually had not seen really anything
about I ended up getting a a PR package
from Urban Decay one day and I was
showing it on my snapchat and so many
people were right back in saying the
one-and-done is my holy grail when I'm
done this my favorite oh my gosh she got
the one and done and I'm like what's the
one and done and then I tried it and I
was like why why have I not heard more
people talking about this why have I not
gotten this sooner I don't understand
where did we go wrong this is the bomb
I am almost out of this and I just got
it a couple months ago I have taken this
traveling with me really has just become
a favorite of mine it's really
interesting because it's called the
hybrid complexion Perfector it's
supposed to be kind of like from what I
gather kind of like a cross between like
a BB cream but then also a foundation
it's not supposed to be really heavy
it's you know said to be lightweight but
it still blurs out the skin and all this
good stuff to me I think of it as more
of a foundation but just with a little
bit of a not even minor coverage because
I'm not a big fan of like a really light
coverage foundation it's like the
coverage is still I would say like solid
light to medium catering on medium but
it's so lightweight on the skin it's
just so nice you don't feel like you're
wearing foundation it's really
effortless to put on and I just think
the end result is just super stunning so
so this is one that I wish I would have
had in my collection sooner I wish I
would have heard about sooner
which I would have been recommending it
sooner I just love my one and done
another foundation that I have here is
from Make Up For Ever this is the Ultra
HD foundation now this is one that I
heard a ton about and then also the
stick foundation which the stick
foundation is also still on by a Sephora
love stylist and I swear I'm going to
give it one of these days but since I
got this one I was like let's just let's
just take your time Samantha because I'm
buying so many other foundations at the
moment of the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
I was always hearing so many people talk
about it I think one of the big reasons
why I didn't gravitate towards it right
away is because makeup forever was a
brand that I didn't really have a ton
from I'm kind of brand loyal I would say
my friend a brand that I really enjoy or
I really love I gravitate towards them a
lot and they buy a lot of their
different products and I buy a lot of
their new releases and things like that
and makeup forever was one that I don't
know I think maybe I thought it was kind
of pricey when I was first starting out
with makeup so even when I was hearing
all these people recommend it I was like
I know you know I'll stick with the
other brands that I you know no one
loves so much and I I'm really upset
with myself because I love this
foundation I actually got this sent to
me in an influencer box and I have the
email of saying that I was in the makeup
forever
box box I was like oh my gosh that's
super cool and then when they sent the
foundation I was like hey I've always
wanted to try this in it was a full-size
foundation so I was like this is the
freaking bomb and I love this foundation
I was just wearing it I think was the
day before I'm filming this video it's
definitely one of those I did a video of
like my what did I call my safety net
makeup products like the makeup products
that I just reach for when I don't have
to think about doing my makeup I don't
have to take extra time doing my makeup
I just reach for those products that
never fail me and this is turning into
one of those products because the other
day I was in a rush I just need to get
my makeup done I was like what
foundation am I gonna wear it and I
pulled up the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
so this is definitely one I wish I would
have gone for sooner another item here
from Urban Decay I think I have one more
coming up I don't know what it was about
Urban Decay but I even sent it in past
videos like Lillywhite videos like just
not really gravitating a ton towards the
brand all these different things and I
don't know why because I'm like deeply
ashamed of myself because now I'm loving
so many of their products that is insane
but this is definitely a concealer that
everyone was always hyping up this is
the Naked skin concealer so the
weightless complete
concealer the full name of it what I
think happened with this one is that
everybody was always recommending this
one and I also heard people always
recommending the NARS radiant creamy
concealer I have these two this one and
the NARS I have those both on my list
for a very long time of you just need to
try these etc and I ended up being able
to try the NARS radiant creamy concealer
and I want to say it was maybe with the
so small box is what's in my mind where
I got to try it from it was a
subscription box it's no longer
available now but you could try you
could get like samples of high-end
makeup and they would send you pretty
decent samples and I did not like the
NARS radiant creamy concealer or
whatever that was I did not like that
concealer at all at all so when I had
both these on my list I was like okay
well number one failed me so I'm not
gonna go for number two like I'll stick
with what I like I have a ton of
concealers that I love and then the
shape tape came out and you know
everyone's roles blew up so I was like
nope I just don't need to go for it and
went Urban Decay sent that package with
the one and done they also sent these
concealers and I was like I'll just give
it a try
like why did I pick the NARS over the
Urban Decay and that was that was where
my mistake was because I love this
concealer and I swear guys since I
started using this one which was a
couple months ago samus with the one and
done I think I've reached for my shape
tape like two or three times I think
this one has officially jumped above the
shape tape and that is saying a lot
because I love the shape tape and I
recommend it all the time I use it all
the time but sitting here right now I
cannot remember the last time that I
used my shape tape and I have other
concealers that I enjoy too but like
this is my number one right now this is
what's going traveling with me like this
is my this is my like this is this is my
concealer at the moment I'm super bummed
I was not buying this sooner because
this is the bomb
I always are people raving about the
Tarte blushes the Tarte Amazonian clay
blushes oh they're so good they're so
pigmented they're so long-lasting and
I'm like yeah they're so expensive
though like what do you do about that
mmm I'm not really sure and then uh was
it last year I think it was this past
year
that the birthday gift at Sephora was a
tarte mini blush and like a tart mini
lipstick and I was like let's go ahead
and go for that so I got this little
cute little mini blush in part a from
Tarte for my birthday gift from Sephora
and I was like oh well I really like
those blushes so that's neat so I
learned my lessons that tart blushes are
actually fantastic and then I did want
to like ask the holiday time was coming
up I was like I should purchase one of
those Tarte blush books that everybody
talks about but then I heard some people
saying that the Tarte holiday blushes
are not typically as good as the regular
blushes so then I wasn't really sure
what to do and I actually had the a
subscriber send me the turkic blush book
three that they came out for this
holiday time now I'm telling you guys I
used this nearly every single day I'm
reaching for those is so often that I
have to remind myself to use something
else I have on kindred today and it is
one of my favorite neutral blushes I
think it is gorgeous and then peachy is
a gorgeous peachy blush I love these
blushes and even though I have this huge
book and my mini they still have other
holiday releases out they have a another
big one where I think it has eight
blushes but then they have a quad and
I'm really considering getting the quad
even though I clearly don't need any
more tart blushes but I still want it
because I still want more power flashes
in my life like how crazy is that
but yes the Tarte blushes I feel like
they are just as good as everybody says
they are and I wish I would have gone
for them sooner so I have a brow product
here to talk about and if you guys are
not new to my channel or you're maybe
following me from like way back when I
first started and especially when I
first started my beauty videos versus my
book videos you might know that I
struggled with brows that I probably
almost my first full year being on
YouTube I did not do my brows I just
left them be in their natural state
which really confused and actually upset
a lot of people and once I was like okay
girlfriend like let's try to learn how
to do your brows I was buying different
products and nothing was really working
out
wasn't getting the hang of it and I was
getting super frustrated I was like I'm
trying but I'm not learning like what is
what is happening here and then I
finally purchased from a benefit the
precisely my brow pencil and it was just
like it clicked I was able to get it and
so this pencil I wish I would have just
gone for this in the beginning I know
these are more expensive these are in
the $20 range and I kept going for more
of like the drugstore affordable brow
products because I was trying to learn
you know that's how I I justified it you
know because I was like well you don't
want to you know get something really
expensive and not be able to get it
because then that's a waste of money but
honestly I think if I just would have
hopped over it the other ones that I
have been trying and just the point for
the precisely my brow pencil
I felt like months of frustration and
tears over brows could have been erased
if I just went with the precisely my
brow pencil I have this on today and
even though I actually wasn't going to
film today so I did a sheet mask right
before and for some reason I think
having a sheet mask on and then trying
to do brows is like the hardest thing in
the world so I'm probably not having a
great broad day and do apologize for
that but I did want to get this video
filmed but the precisely my brow I mean
I always have this one in my clutch it
always comes in my travel bag with me
it's just my favorite it's just my
favorite I wish I would've purchased
this sooner
so the next item I have here is the
other one from Urban Decay that I was
talking about if you guys been watching
my videos for a while you know what I'm
about to say let's all say it together
sin yes the Urban Decay afterglow ate
our powder highlight in sin Wow and I
have you guys to thank for having me by
this little guy I was asking for
suggestions after my trying to
subscribers if they weren't makeup video
and everybody and I mean everybody was
saying Urban Decay sin so I bought this
little guy the highlighters are pretty
pricey at $26 but I bought it sounds
like okay everyone's told me that this
is their favorite so I'm going to do it
and what okay that turned into my
favorite as well it is such a stunning
highlight and it has me completely sold
on the Urban Decay highlights at this
moment and planning on picking up
the Urban Decay highlight palette I'm
not sure which one yet they have an
older one and then they just released a
new one I haven't decided which one I'm
going to get yet if you guys have any
opinions let me know but I feel like the
older one maybe has more shades that
would be good for my skin tone the newer
one has some kind of like funkier shades
but I'm like don't be afraid of funky
highlights girls I don't know which one
I'm gonna do but I am waiting I'm
patiently waiting for those Black
Friday's every monday sales
I am patiently waiting over here but I
am sold I definitely want more Urban
Decay highlights I've like embarrassed
so that I didn't know that these were so
good sooner I'm embarrassed I didn't
have these in my collection sooner I'm
so sorry
Urban Decay highlighters I'm sorry and
then I'm going to wrap it up with two
different
lip products the first one here from
dose of colors the dose of colors a
liquid lipsticks and I just love these
and I always heard people recommending
dose of colors lipsticks especially
stone you guys remember when everybody
was wearing stone
what do you learned today does color
stone like I just wanted to lie and say
it was very dose of color stone because
I felt like I wasn't fitting in and it
was finally when a dose of colors came
to Ulta that I was like okay I'm just
gonna go ahead and give him a try so not
only did I pick up stone duh but I also
bought an eyeshadow palette which I'm so
impressed with us well but a liquid
lipstick lover anyways like these are
what I'm really gravitating towards
because not only do I have stone but
then I also picked one up from there
Mint collection and this one is called
minty and then I actually had my friend
Candice send me this one which is in
rosebud I was just wearing it in one of
my recent clothing haul video it's not
my last one but the one with Windsor and
Carli bybel and misguided I was wearing
it and there it's a really cool cool
toned lipstick but man main am i
embarrassed I'll just do some swatches
real quick here are some swatches of the
three that I have so this one is stone
this one is minty and the last one here
is rosebud so I mean I love all three
shades of course but I also love the
formula and I'm just I'm so upset with
myself that I didn't purchase them
sooner it was totally because they
weren't in you know like an Ulta I'm
someone who I need to get over this I
than I do but I'm just so attracted to
the reward systems at like a Sephora and
Ulta or websites like Tarte I know Tarte
has a really good reward system too so I
produced from the Tarte website every
once in a while but it's just so much
better you know you get your Ebates and
then especially Ulta like I'm a sucker
for alpha because I feel like that
rewards system it's just like the
freakin bomb so that's why when they
went into Ulta I was like okay I'm
finally going to try them and I'm like
girl you should have just ordered from
their website because this was a shame
that I did not have the liquid lipsticks
in my collection sooner just just a
crying shame
and then the final lipsticks I want to
talk about are from Oprah oh yes I've
also been talking about fraud a lot in
my videos lately but I just a friendly
tried throat look with lipsticks for the
first time this year and I was like why
why because I always are people
recommending not only the Oprah
lipsticks but also the highlighters I
could have put the whole four
highlighters in this video as well but I
just love the lipsticks even more and I
think it again was the same thing as
dose of colors once over came over into
Alta I was like okay I'll give him a try
and just thought like wow you have
really been missing out you have been
missing out I not only had to grab a
stone from dose of colors on my clutch I
also had to grab Manila from Oprah out
of my clutch I was actually just wearing
Manila last weekend when we went out and
it's one of my favorite favorite news so
it was still in my clutch from that
night out I'm just gonna do a few
swatches here so I can show you three
these are only three that I have I think
I have like seven or maybe eight of the
Oprah a liquid lipsticks so here are
some swatches so I have bel-air and then
Manila and then also nude potion nude
potion was one that was in collaboration
with and nikkietutorials but Manila is
definitely a favorite favorite nude of
mine I feel like these are so
long-lasting they're super comfortable
I'm just obsessed I want even more over
a liquid lipsticks I think they're
fantastic so I really wish I would have
had these in my collection sooner okay
so that is gonna do it for today's video
chatting about to makeup that I wish I
would have purchased sooner that I wish
I would have had in my collection sooner
