today's video is going to be a little
bit different I'm going to be doing a
makeup tag video that I've seen floating
around my friend Diana on Twitter
actually is the one who sent me a video
I think it was last week it was specific
her video on the makeup step roulette
tag and I watched the whole video and I
thought it was so funny I actually went
back and watch it again and I just
thought it would make for a really fun
and funny video so I decided I wanted to
take on the makeup step roulette
challenge basically what it is I'm
obviously starting out makeup free and
then I have each of my makeup steps in
here on a post-it I'm going to reach in
and grab one read it out and then I have
to do that step so in the third sex
video I think she like first started out
with like a liquid eyeliner and I think
her foundation was the very last step I
thought it was super funny I couldn't
stop laughing during it I thought it
would be fun to make this one today I'm
filming this on Monday I had one of the
most intense becomes ever after shooting
the judgmental palette and trying to
test that baby out and put up a very
in-depth review video on Sunday night so
I was like you know what I'm still I
feel like I have a hangover from the
weekend after all that craziness so why
don't we just do something fun and that
would make me laugh and this is why
we're going to do the makeup step
roulette challenge I'm super excited to
try this out and I have no idea it's
going to go obviously but yesterday I
want say thank you so much for clicking
on my video I hope you have a good time
watching this if you haven't subscribe
yet I thought that you will consider
hitting the subscribe button I do post
videos at least four times a week
Wednesdays is my will i buy it series I
also post on Thursdays Sundays and
Mondays and then I livestream on
Tuesdays at 4 p.m. CST and then
sometimes I do throw in a bonus weekend
videos as well you've lost a lot of
content and I hope that you'll consider
hitting the subscribe button
before you leave but if you would like
to see my makeup step roulette to
challenge please keep watching okay I
have everything written down these
little posted I hope I have every step
and after I cut him up and I was like
pushing them into the cup a couple spell
and I grabbed them but my dog was there
too I don't think she ate any of them
and I don't think any of them are like
underneath my dishwasher where they fell
but if we're missing a soap
that's why hopefully we're not missing
that I thought I got them all so I'm
just going to reach in and grab one out
no way starting very very well so the
first step we have is face primer that's
pretty good is that an omen for how this
videos going to go well for my face
primer I just have the amazing cosmetics
anti-aging face primer I really do like
this primer I use it quite a bit feels
very like silicone II but then also like
a moisturizer this is starting very well
I should pull my hair back shouldn't I
yes put your hair back Mincy I feel like
we're starting off strong start muster
on a I'll try the next slide okay so we
have you know what that says so this one
I wrote under eye shadow so that's like
lower lash line shadows so before we
have any shadow on our adds we're going
to go ahead and finish off that lower
lash line make sense I had grabbed out
some makeup geek shadows this is what I
was on planning to you so I'm going to
grab out some of mocha right here it's
one of the new shades that makeup geek
sent me that I did a live swatch on so
if you haven't seen that video yet I'll
have it to link down below it was my
first-ever live streaming video it was
super super fun perfect face primer
under eye shadow we're doing good guys
we're doing good so next up we've got
feel like a well liked try to show you
first so you guys know that I don't I'm
not like cheating or anything
this says under-eye powder perfect so
what I meant by that is I like to set my
concealer on my under eyes so great we
don't have any concealer but we're just
going to go ahead and set it before we
put the concealer on that I get it so
I'm back to my Rimmel stay matte powder
it's just a translucent powder from the
drugstore I've gone through several of
these I just really like it so I'm just
going to take one of my Tarte unicorns
brushes and you know just go ahead and
and my under-eye for a real no real
reason but you know dig back in here
okay so here we go what's this one say
upside down it says yeah it was totally
upside down all lipstick that's great
I love lipstick so to put it on like
soon into the makeup application process
I feel like I get it I don't we get it I
haven't pulled out my Sigma lipstick in
a while this is the Sigma in space power
at lipstick it's a really pretty pink
shade so go ahead and get our lipstick
on I feel pretty confident in my look
right now so hey moving on to the next
step here we go alright is it upside
down again no blush perfect hey we have
face primer on we don't got foundation
on but we're going to get our blush on
so that's that's great I have this
little NARS blush that I've been trying
to use more it's called a Goulet or goo
cool
I don't really know it's the blush
thought you got last year for being a so
for a vib Rouge member because they're
like hey you spent so much money we're
going to send you the teeny little blush
in the whole world to say think so I've
been trying to use it because I'm like
hey this blush with $1,000 like use it
more may use one of my Tarte unicorn
brushes again and this blush blush of
these cheeks you know blush is on now we
are really looking good the black really
made a difference so good thing that
that was the next step okay moving on to
the next step of what would we put on
after blush okay here it is it is oh my
crease shade well that's perfect we
haven't put our frame on yet but we do
have our lower lash shadow on so it just
makes sense to now go in with our crease
color perfect okay so I'm going to come
back into my makeup geek palette and I
was going to use mocha as I appreciate
so real pretty Brown I only did crease
shade and closed the other when I did
lid shade because I was like I don't
know how many steps of the eyes we're
going to really need to take here so I
just
those two so I went with a pretty deep
brown shade going to apply mocha into my
crease right there we go mocha is
applied in the crease it's going very
well I can't wait to put eye primer on
over my crease shade it might give us a
really interesting look that I never
knew that I you know wanted to go for so
challenge is going very well so far I'm
moving on to the next step when we start
off with face primer I really thought I
was like wall makeup guys are looking
down on me today I grabbed out two there
so really thought we were going to do
well but uh what we got next
oh setting spray ah okay
so I'm going to set everything you know
my blush my powder that hasn't said
anything perfect
I've been using the Mario Badescu one a
lot perfect
let's keep moving and see what we have
next
I really hope some of you guys are
getting a laugh out of this goes again I
just I needed a laugh today it was a
stressful weekend Oh liquid liner good
before I pry verse still excellent so
good liner I just got this one recently
from La Bella Donna it's there a liquid
eyeliner I'm going to give it a try I
haven't been having the best luck with
La Bella Donna products they sent me a
really nice package and unfortunately
I've had quite a few like in my fails
during my makeup monthly but give the
eyeliner try and see what we think it
has a very sharp tip to it like a felt
tip so unfortunately I can tell that the
eyeliner is like super super Skippy so
that's definitely not the best like
eyeliner application I've ever done but
I wasn't planning on going anywhere
after this and I made that wing really
really huge so oh my I didn't add like a
clean up eyeliner step because by b.i it
Oh didn't love the liquid eyeliner pen
and eyeliner looks insane by John that's
fine that's cool
still okay we're right on track out next
step we got what we get what do we get
it is my lid shade perfect after
eyeliner that is typically when I do
I'll play my lid shade self that's great
let's shade I did want to use one of the
new makeup geek foiled shadows I don't
want to put karma on my eyes which is
this one right here maybe existing about
doing the lid shade after my liners
since I didn't love my liner we're just
basically going to cover that up yes
like no one's going to notice they are
Cespedes deck okay the shade is so
intense we're not even having eye primer
down like whole my goodness what's so
sad to me is that it remembers that I
haven't done my eyelid primer yet so I'm
going to have to cover up all this
beautiful mess
maybe I'm just going to pack it on even
more than maybe the eyelid primer is the
one that fell underneath my dishwasher
studs alright it is seriously so friggin
intense no primer no fix+
no anything like today just some good
old liquid liner and appreciate can't
forget that here we go next step we have
what is it what is it I kind of like
that you guys know before me it's kind
of fun oh look they're always upside
down brow bone and inner corner
highlight the other two steps that like
in my mind they just like kind of go
together so I figured for the sake of
time we could put these together as well
so perfect now I'm going into a little
makeup geek palette I have to shade
whimsical right here like a really
pretty pinky white shade so I'm going to
use my morphe EA teen you know I haven't
done my brows yet but that doesn't
matter because we're just going to go
ahead and make sure the brow bone is
highlighted inner corner yes yes yes
this is a really pretty shade for these
tasks actually like in real life when I
do my makeup I would totally the shade
because that is so dull Bertie all right
I'm feeling pretty confident in my looks
guys
next one I really hope I get to finish
before my husband comes home because
otherwise he's going to be like very
concerned with what I've been doing all
day
what do we got brows I'm just going to
take my benefit goose proof pencil so
I'm just going to spoolie out some brows
and then and give them a little bit of
help like I went very heavy on this brow
like fluid look way too dramatic on this
one but you know what that's okay I've
been getting a lot of compliments lately
on my rope which is like truly freaking
me out so you guys know when I first
started youtube I did not do my brows at
all and the comments were very real but
people be very upset that I didn't get
my brows and over on Instagram ohm and
it was even worse I do a tutorial not do
my brows and people are like does it
even count if you do a makeup tutorial
if you don't do your brows but I think
I've been working around and
experimenting with different brow
products but still like when a comment
comes in like I like your brows today
I'm like you being serious are using me
like I actually I don't know I have to
think about it like what real so see
here what what do we have what do we
have is it upside down no yes it is
lashes that's great because we still
haven't put eye primer on yet that makes
makes perfect sense to put lashes on
right now excellent I'm gonna put on
some ardell lashes so these look like
maybe some are gel with these glamour
with these I think my camera needs a
moment to out cool down because it is
overheating which is fine because I'm
just going to put some adhesive on these
and we'll get these bad boys on
fantastic
the camera is cooling down as hot
dongles ardell lashes it's going to be
great when I put on my eye primer over
all of my other eye makeup okay what do
we get highlight before foundation
why cuz I've been really liking the
highlight shade in this TARDIS contour
palette vol 3 so I'm just going to take
a little bit of like the pinky highlight
in there with my luck c5 at 22 tapered
highlight brush and I guess I'm just
going to try to like really pack the
highlight on as well because still have
to put on foundation this is not going
as well as I planned like just knowing
that I have to still put foundation on
over all of this and I frame around like
if those two steps could have gotten out
of the way just a little bit earlier I
would have felt even better but you know
we can't all have the love guys this is
how much we can actually blow after we
put on foundation after highlight so
next step here we go what do we have
here we have foundation why cancel stuff
is events for which why for my
foundation I'm going to use my wet and
wild photo focus foundation I don't like
really love this foundation so that's
why I thought I'd pull it out for this
I'll just go ahead and cover up my
beautiful blush and highlight so fun
doing those steps just to come right
back up I'm going to blend that out with
my Sigma SAE kabuki brush goodbye
highlight this was real for one step I
didn't even get to enjoy the highlight
just mean so like covering out some of
my brows as well because normally like I
can't do brows before foundation listen
to me like I'm such a brow furs and now
I can't do my brows over eyes in my
foundation DOS I mean like maybe some
highlight right there but feeling we're
getting down there and steps right like
how many more steps could we have to go
okay
guy grabs - so let me grab this one
what's it say ah mascara great isn't
Philips Caroline you ever have eyelashes
on so
I didn't even get upfront my lashes for
myself lashes excellent about my Sigma
pink mascara just to really make things
even more well crazy because I mean this
is a it's a pink mascara very fun though
okay pink mascara is on when are we
doing our eye primer this is causing me
so much anxiety you know next step here
we go what do we have here we have our
waterline
time for some eyeliner not one of my
color pop liners this one has been maybe
because it's a really fun green and I
feel like I have not used this lately we
are really going to actually do every
single freaking eye up including lashes
before we put our eye primer on that is
just fantastic next step we have what is
it it is bronzer excellent I haven't
done my contour yet but we're going to
go heaven run some skin up look I
haven't used my Physicians Formula
bronze booster lately I really like both
the contour and bronzer shades so I
figure I could give it a try still I'm
totally obsessed with that one school
shade as well that I have as my brow
bone and inner corner highlight like I
need to use that for real so now we are
officially bronze - so after bronzer we
are going to go ahead and contour again
typically best to contour and then from
their graves totally makes sense so I'm
going to go into the middle shade in
that position formula palette with my
Sigma sl6 contour over that bronzers
little slight nose contour as well and
yet we are we are looking good yet so
next up in here we have concealer I
almost forgot that we don't have
concealer on our face concealer time I
grabbed out my pure cameo contour
earth go ahead and use the concealer
side remember that we already set our
concealer so that's pretty good perfect
this feels right this definitely feels
right I'm using my morphe g2 to blend
this out not sure why but my concealer
is still high on my forehead I clearly
was not looking in my mirror but you
know it's all good and I see one lone
post-it note in here which can only mean
that this is one thing ah I primer how
is our eye primer the very last step
that is so cruel so to typically end my
makeup tutorials I go ahead and prime my
eyes so I'm going to use my Smashbox 24
hour photo finish primer and just prime
away Oh me and so I'm just going to take
a little bit on my finger and oh that
feels so wrong I cannot believe that I'm
having to do eye primer laughs I'm going
to take a little brush from my makeup
brush set and just basically wipe away
the beautiful shade oh man basically
what my eye primer did was wiped away
the beautiful karma shade except for
what was over lining the eye liner and
now that's kind of like bright green but
yeah after we go ahead and prime my
eyelids does makeup look is complete
excellent okay so that is going to do it
for the makeup step rule eyes and makeup
challenge of makeup tag I had a lot of
fun filming this video I hope it was fun
to watch I needed a good laugh after the
craziness of this weekend I thought this
would be the perfect video to do it and
I hope you got some laughs out of it as
well and zoomed in a little bit so we
could see the final look together my eye
shadow is basically gone after we do the
primer but
one highlight an inner corner I mean
that's still looking pretty strong my
eyeliner looks a little bit on the
strange side you know my lipstick which
we applied what second or third or
something like that I mean that's uh
looking pretty good
not too bad but yeah it's my makeup step
roulette final result so I hope that you
enjoyed this video and got a good laugh
out of it if you have a youtube channel
I tag you to take on the makeup step
roulette challenge because that was a
lot of fun and just something a little
bit interesting and different to do if
you guys have any other makeup challenge
or makeup tag videos that you'd be
interested in seeing for me go ahead and
leave up in the description box down
below like I said this isn't my normal
type of video but I thought would be fun
to do something a little bit on the
different side so I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this video and I hope that
