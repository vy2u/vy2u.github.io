today's video is going to be my March
Olympics so if you saw last month I
posted the video of my February Olympics
where I was going through each of the
lipsticks as that I wore in all of my
youtube videos throughout the month of
February I wasn't sure how the video was
going to go over but it went over really
well a lot of people seem to really
enjoy it and I did get asked if I would
make it a monthly series because I had
mentioned in there that I wasn't sure if
I would make it a monthly thing it
wasn't sure how people would enjoy it so
I got asked a lot in that video to do
more of them and then also these past
couple weeks here in my youtube videos
I've been getting asked if I am going to
do a March lip pics video so even though
I didn't originally have a plain-out to
do I thought I would go ahead and do it
it seemed like people really liked the
style that I did last month where I do a
swatch of the lipstick on my hand and
then I also insert a photo of what I
look like in that video so you can see
what the lipstick looked like on me so
I'm going to do that same app format for
this one as well but thank you guys for
requesting this video and I'm really
excited to do it so for the month of
March I posted 28 videos if you are new
to my channel I typically do post every
single day and sometimes I do take a
Saturday off here or there so you either
get 6 or 7 videos from me a week so in
March I posted 28 videos but only 26
will have lipsticks because two videos
word to clutters where I wasn't actually
on camera so I have 26 lip products to
share with you so if you're ready for a
new Olympics video let me go ahead and
get started already starting off with
March first I posted what is on my tax
refund wishlist this was a collab video
with my friend Ashley cleany here on
YouTube I wore the maybelline superstay
matte ink in poet this is a new one to
me I mentioned that I've been wanting to
try these out I picked up I think I now
have three different shades of these so
I've been trying them out so I wore poet
in that first video and a little follow
up here we did get a tax refund which I
was very excited about
I am self-employed so when you're
self-employed you kind of don't know I
pay an estimate taxes throughout the
year since I am not taxed but we did get
a refund which I was very excited about
and we bought
dishwasher from that video whoo and I
did also get a new pair of shoes as well
not the not the shoes that I put in that
video because I just could not find them
on sale but I found a good pair of
running shoes at Kohl's for way way
cheaper so pretty excited about that
but here is what Maybelline a poet it
looks like so I really like this kind of
like pinky nude on me but wow these are
really sticky I mean they last for a
very long time don't get me wrong with
the color last for a very long time but
they are sticky the entire day every
time I would put my lips together even
you know seven hours after I had this
lipstick on my lips to look peel off of
one another so I'm not sure like I said
I got a couple different shades and I'm
kind of like slowly testing them out but
I'm not sure I'll be reviewing this soon
but I'm not really quite sure what I
think about these based on that level of
stickiness I like the way it looked I
like that it stayed for a while but boom
I could do without that sticky feeling
on the second eye +28 get ready with me
and I did my day to night makeup look so
for my daytime makeup look I used this
color pop luxe lipstick and it's still
crazy
I reviewed these in my most recent
makeup monthly and this one is
definitely my favorite out of the three
that I have from the color palette luxe
lipstick line I think it's really creamy
a lot of people were saying when I
reviewed them and I said I felt like the
finishes were different on all three
that I have a lot of people wrote in and
said you think the exact same thing
which is really really bizarre so that
one is still crazy from colour-pop and
then for my night look I did the Sigma
liquid lipstick and Fox Club this is one
of my favorite shades I loved foxglove
so much I think it's such a cool color I
definitely see myself wearing this a lot
too in the warmer months here it's like
two degrees outside as I say that but
you know spring is here I think so there
is one a Sigma Fox Club it looks like so
that is what I chose for my night look
again I do love this color
Ian let's see next up I did a makeup
monthly and I wore a flower beauty one
of their a liquid lipsticks and this is
in Rosewood this is my first time trying
out a flower beauty liquid lipstick I
was really excited to because I really
enjoy flower beauty a lot
their products are a big hit for me so I
was excited to test out a liquid
lipstick this one is definitely more of
a moosie formula it's kind of like thick
and moosie but I really did enjoy this
color again this is in Rosewood and it
lasted really good throughout the day as
well it wasn't too thick I don't love
super moosie liquid lipsticks the
Anasazi Beverly Hills liquid lipsticks
but this was like it wasn't too much I
like these I would definitely pick up
more colors from the flower beauty at
liquid lipstick line on March 4th I
posted a at March Madness video and I
had just grabbed out this a two-faced
sweet peach creamy peach oil lip gloss
and pure peach I'll try to go ahead and
do a swatch here and see if you can even
even see it because it is pretty sheer I
like the way these smell I kind of
swatched it over at the flower beauty
but that's okay
so that's it right there I like the way
they smell I like the way they feel on
the lips and when I just don't want to
do a whole lot you know I don't want to
go through the process of putting on a
liquid lipstick I don't even really want
to put on a creamy lipstick I'll put
this on because it's not like too much
of a gloss it really is more just like a
tinted lip oil for me it gives me a
little something-something makes my lips
look a little juicy but I actually do
like this little guy and then the next
day I posted what's in my makeup a
backup drawer which that video went over
really well also which was super fun and
I use one of the Sephora liquid
lipsticks I think they're called they're
creamy lip stains and this is in pink
tea I really really like this liquid
lipstick I love this color I actually
have another one on today but it was
like too nude I think it was called like
blush nude or nude blush or something
like that it was like kind of concealer
lips on me so I did put a Urban Decay
gloss over it but this one is a pink at
tea from Sephora and these are super
super long lasting liquid lipsticks I am
very very much impressed with these I
will have my Sephora vib sale
recommendations on wishlist video going
up soon I know I've been getting asked
from doing it those are some of my
favorite videos to make for sure doing
it I just post pretty close to the sale
and these will definitely be recommended
for me because I think
awesome already so I'm moving on on the
sixth I posted a Willie bite video and I
wore in there at the nars Anna I really
like NARS lipsticks and Anna is such a
beautiful beautiful shade mmm just my
kind of really beautiful Mavi tones I do
love this one I feel like a lot of
people talk about NARS Anna it
definitely is a really beautiful
lipstick and then I posted my indie
brand reviews which again there was
another video that a lot of people seem
to like I do have Part two coming up
here soon I'm just finishing up a couple
of reviews on some of the products so
I'm really excited to post that but I've
wore from lawless Beauty this is the leo
liquid lipstick I reviewed these
recently as well and I've just been
raving about the lawless liquid
lipsticks they are pricier so again
you're gonna see this mentioned in my
Sephora VIP recommendations because I
suggest getting them at a discount so I
think there are like $25 which is very
expensive for liquid lipsticks but they
are phenomenal they're super comfortable
they're very long-lasting there's no
stickiness to them at all and the colors
that I've been trying are beautiful that
one is Leo just a really nice peachy
nude one of my favorites so big big fan
of these lawless liquid lipsticks and
then on the 8th is when I posted my
collab video what Angelica where we
chose each other's makeup and that is
when I actually wore NARS Anna a lot of
times I do film twice a day and because
I upload so much it's easier for me to
film twice a day a lot of times I do day
to night makeup so I'm switching my
lipstick color but if I'm ever doing a
video where I'm applying makeup on
camera you know I get ready with me a
first impressions or things like that a
lot of times not all the time but a lot
of times I'll just film in that same
face of makeup same lipstick and
everything sometimes I switched the
lipstick sometimes I just keep it on so
that's what I did for that video so
Angelica is the one who actually got me
to bust out NARS Anna and then let's see
here on the 11th I posted my February
lip pics video so that is kind of fun
and I wore the urban decay of backtalk
lipstick you're gonna see this one
mention again and the urban came back
talked lipstick like really oh it really
got me this month I feel like I've been
wearing it so much I've been putting it
in my purse to go out with me again it's
really beautiful Bob it's it's lighter
than the NAR
Anna but it's just like this beautiful
combination of like pink and mock tones
and it's so beautiful
Urban Decay's lipsticks are some of my
favorite I have so many now I would
highly recommend them I think that they
are beautiful and I love backtalk on the
12th I posted a March Madness video and
I wore this lipstick from as yuan-chi
which is a really cool Orange it's
called Mandarin and I can't save the
second part of this this name like I I
think I can't say it I know what it
sounds like but I can't get my voice to
say this word correctly so I just always
like Mandarin so this one from achieve
on chi it's just a really cool and it's
such a cool orange when I was talking
about it in my lipstick declutter where
I did my colorful lipsticks that's like
I just can't get rid of this one because
it's just such a cool color to me and I
don't have a lot like that so that is
Yvonne she won I think it's pretty sweet
especially again for the warmer months
of spring summer I feel like I'd wear
that one even more and then the 13th I
post a declutter so I didn't have my
lipstick on there 14th I posted another
will I might video and I wore another
Urban Decay lipstick this one is in
naked this one I had to grab out of my
purse because I just wore it over the
weekend as well again this one is just
such a beautiful light pinky nude big
fan of the Urban Decay lipsticks I wear
them a lot they're just one of those
that are like comfortable but pigmented
and they still last a long time but
again they're so comfortable and just so
easy to apply I just find myself
reaching for them so often and then
let's see here so we did yuvan she we
did Urban Decay on the 15th I posted my
March musings of video and I wore NARS
hellgate this color is really really
cool but I will say I'm kind of running
out of room to swatch here I will say
that I probably should included this in
my red lipstick declutter but I think
what threw me off is when I was going
through my lipsticks and doing a bunch
of swatches was that I mean it
definitely swatches red but like not
like right I don't know how to describe
it it wasn't like the other Reds that I
had in my collection but I feel like it
looks different on if you go back and
you watch that March musings video or if
you even just look at my thumbnail I
feel like it looks like a much
or like bright intense red than how it
swatches so it just kind of like went
over my head anyways even if I put this
in the declutter I would definitely be
keeping it these are called the these
couple lip pigments from NARS I can't
remember their correct name now or lip
powers or something like that but this
one isn't Hellgate and I love the shade
I think it's beautiful it's not super
super long-lasting it definitely does
wear away I actually went to the movies
the night of filming that video and like
by the time it was done I was eating
popcorn and drink soda and all of that
when I went into the bathroom after the
movie I did touch up my lipstick so it's
not like a liquid lipstick and it's not
the most long-lasting it will wear away
but still it looks really nice on the
lips it's very opaque and I love this
color so much so that one was Hellgate
from NARS so moving on on the 16th I
posted the drugstore products and
exceeded my expectations this was a
collab with Kelly Gooch and I wore NYX a
soft-spoken this is a NYX soft matte
matte soft matte lipstick lip cream no
no this is a NYX liquid suede love this
formula but especially love this color
so there is the swatch of soft-spoken I
like it because it's like darker like
it's a darker nude but it's not like too
dark and I just again I love the liquid
suede formulas I have so many of those
and then on the 17th I posted it get
ready with me trying out some new makeup
and I first tried out this Revlon kiss
pumping lip creme and I tried it in
Kashmir creme and you guys saw like the
mega fail in that video if you watched
that video it did not look good and on
me in the slightest it was like I had to
zoom in and even likes watching I don't
know what I don't I don't know I don't
know there's a swatch of it I mean it's
pretty light and you can't really see it
and it's kind of glossy but it's like it
did nothing flattering for me is like
nope I can't even take myself seriously
with us on I tried another one of these
and had basically the same experience
I'm gonna try a third one before I give
it my review because I'm like I don't
maybe the colors are too light so I'm
gonna try my darkest one next and see
what I think but so far those are a
no-go
so when that didn't work out guess what
I went to an urban decay lipstick
because I don't steer me wrong this one
is in stark naked so I'd used naked and
now I've also used stark
they just really want to make sure that
we know that they like to come out with
naked products I mean it's that not the
most beautiful nude it's so beautiful I
love stark naked
I love naked I'll backtalk I mean but
this nude is so beautiful and again just
apply so easily this is the comfort mat
and I agree when they say that because
they apply like a creamy lipstick but
they do look matte on the lips but still
they're not drying at all it's it's just
beautiful
okay that's really all there is to it
and then on the 18th I posted about the
Auto 21 days of beauty sale and I wore a
lipstick from Mac and this is in Mayor
may her murder I really have no idea how
to say that name but a lot of people
have recommended the shade to me and I
had it but I don't think I'd worn it yet
or I'd only worn it like one other time
before putting it in that video but it's
a really nice rosy pink so thank you
guys for suggesting this one from Mac
for me I really do like that color as
well and then on the 19th I posted a
March Madness video I wore Urban Decay
backtalk told you you would see that
again and then the 20th I posted makeup
that I don't regret not buying and I
wore Urban Decay stark-naked who was
surprised I think that one was actually
I think I was doing the same look from
my get ready with me so again that was
why I was wearing the lipstick again but
then on the 21st I did it will i buy it
video this was my one with georgia which
was so fun and once again I wore
lawlessly oh when I was getting ready to
go over to George's hotel room to film
like the products that I brought with me
were just like the staples you know the
ones that I knew wouldn't let me down
kind of thing and of course a la vez leo
made it into my bag the 22nd I got a new
lipstick for you I posted a hall and
first impression to follow up video and
I wore maybelline almond rose I really
enjoyed the Maybelline lipsticks they're
really their entire like a regular
lipstick line the creamy lipsticks the
matte lipsticks I think that they're all
beautiful
there is almond rose it's kind of
similar to the Mac Mayer but I think
it's a little bit more on the pink side
I would say like it just pulls a little
bit more pink versus like rosy I guess I
would say but Maybelline lipsticks I
don't think that you can go wrong with
them on the 23rd is when I posted my
giveaway if you guys have not yet
entered my giveaway it is still
I wanted to post a giveaway on my
birthday I did this last year as well
and so it's a really really big giveaway
so if you guys haven't entered yet it
will be linked in my description box
down below but I wore the Kat Von D
lovecraft lipstick I have a little mini
guy of this and I I just love this
lipstick I reach for it it's so often
because it's just it's comfortable on
the lips I love the shade again it's a
really nice like nude pink nothing like
too overwhelming nothing too dark
nothing too deep but it's not too pink
it's not too nude it's just mmm it's
just one of my favorite lipsticks and I
really enjoyed this Kat Von D formula
the 25th is when I posted my Q&amp;amp;A and I
love doing monochromatic red looks like
when I do a red eye I want to do a red
lip same as when I did my merch musings
video with the NARS hellgate I did
something similar in my Q&amp;amp;A and I wore
Oprah Atlantic City this is one of my
favorite Reds I think it's really
beautiful kept it around with my
lipstick and de-clutter that I recently
did and overlooked what lipsticks are
some of my favorites so there is
Atlantic City again just a really
beautiful read on the 26th I posted a
March Madness video and I wore NYX
abu-dhabi if you watch my latest empties
video I actually like after I used it in
that video I was like girl it's done
like you can't there's nothing left in
this lipstick I had to go in like eight
different times just to try to get it on
my lips so I put it in my empties bin
but I have a new one I had to just go
take a minute to try to get some of the
plastic off so I could do a swatch of it
cuz this one is brand new but it's one
of my favorite nudes again I love the
NYX soft matte lip creams and they're
one of my favorites of formulas and one
that I've been buying for so long so Abu
Dhabi is just a really beautiful nude I
wanted to have another one of that the
27th I posted my lipstick to clutters I
didn't wear a lipstick but on the 28th I
posted a really buy it video and I wore
maybelline truffle tees one of my
favorite nude lipsticks I talked about
this one a ton I just think it's so
gorgeous again I love the Maybelline a
formula so there is that one so you can
see it's kind of like similar ish to
avid to Abu Dhabi but the truffle tease
is definitely a bit lighter and just
more of like a sheer nude on the lips of
one of my favorites on the 29th I posted
what was in my travel makeup bag and I
wore Kat Von D Ludwig I took the
I have a mini as well which is in my
clutch right now and I will full-size I
took the mini with me on my Arizona
vacation and I wore it a ton so I wanted
to wear it in that video I basically
just did like that makeup look that I
wore and Arizona almost the entire time
we were there
kevin dee has some of my favorite liquid
lipstick formulas as well and there is a
Ludwick which i think is a beautiful
light pinky nude and then we are almost
done on the 30th I posted my project pan
update my 18 and 20 18 and I wore this
one from Urban Decay in collaboration
with Kristin lianna
this is in a spellbound I got a lot of
good go got a lot of good compliments
when I wore this lipstick sometimes I
never know when I go outside my comfort
zone people either like really love it
or people are really upset by it but it
seemed like people really liked this
spellbound I will say this one is not as
easy to apply this one is a mega matte
and I definitely can tell the difference
between the comfort mat and the mega mat
it's just a little bit harder to apply a
cut not like skip skips on the lips but
you just kind of you just gotta take
your time with it but the color was
pretty darn cool so I liked that one and
then the last day of the 31st I posted a
honey bun clothing haul and Tryon video
and I wore this little guy from Marc
Jacobs this is an slow burn it is one of
the Lamarck lip cremes I've talked about
these before on my channel I really
really enjoy these I have another mini
as well I get them in like the Sephora
like give me some nude lip sets and I
just think that they're beautiful so it
kind of ran out of room here so let me
just do do a little swatch right there
there is a slow burn if you can get the
minis I really do recommend them because
they're very opaque they're very creamy
you don't need to like go in a lot and
they last a long time but the whole
sizes are super expensive so you can get
a mini if there's a set that has your
attention or you can go in with a friend
or something get the minis because
they're gonna last you a really long
time but after that those are the 26 lip
shades that I wore throughout the month
of March in my youtube videos I think
that's gonna be everything for today's
video going over all of my lipstick
choices for the month of March I hope
that you enjoyed seeing this video once

like to see one for April please do let
