today's video I'm really excited to do
because I'm going to be kicking off my
March Madness series so let me take a
little bit and explain to you how this
is going to work about last month I
posted a video called a beauty battle
and in that video I was pinning
eyeshadow palettes against each other I
had a couple of different rounds and I
was choosing a winner someone commented
on that video I had it screenshot it and
I deleted the screenshot for more room
on my phone I do it so often I'm so
upset with myself but someone did leave
a comment and said it would be fun to
see a March Madness style of video and I
took that and just kind of ran with it I
had all these different thoughts and
ideas that I could do with it and what I
decided to come up with is that for the
next several weeks here it's gonna go
into March and lead us up until the end
of March gonna be sharing at different
videos and I have picked out some of my
favorites in each category from my
makeup collection and I have four in
each category I'm going to tell you a
little bit about them in each video and
then you guys get to vote on your
favorites which one you want to see move
to the next round after we get through
everything in the first category we're
going to go on to the championship round
and I'm gonna pick at the top two that
were chosen from each category we're
gonna talk about them again and you guys
are gonna vote for your absolute
favorites and then I'm going to do a
full face using all of the makeup that
you guys chose for me in this March
Madness series I hope that that makes
sense so today's video I'm going to
focus on four categories we have primer
foundation concealer and then also
setting powder and how you guys will
vote on the categories is YouTube now
has a community tabs if you go to
someone's YouTube channel you'll see
some tabs on the top like videos
playlists about I think it's still there
but there's also a community tab you
click that youtubers can now put up
certain polls so you can vote on what
video topics you would want to see and
things like that and I'm gonna have a
poll each Monday that I post in the
March Madness video and it will have
each of the four items that are going
against each other and you will submit
your vote that way and then I will close
it I believe I'm going to close them on
Fridays I will close it on Friday and I
will choose the top two from each
category and then when we come into the
championship round then those two will
go against each other and
voting will be open for the few days
you'll hold on your favorite product and
then all of those I will do a full face
of all of the makeup that my subscribers
chose for me what are you guys thinking
this idea let me know what you think
Beauty battles gonna go on hold for a
little bit since that was a little bit
different and I was the one doing the
battle and this way I thought it would
be fun because not only does it have
like different rounds and like some
items get to move on and some are just
boo yeah I was there but I thought it
would be fun to have like a subscriber
interaction as well and since the
community tab isn't out there and it's a
really easy way to vote in polls I just
thought it could be fun let me know what
you think about it I'm pretty excited
about it we have quite a few weeks of
this I have the schedule all planned out
then we have to go into the championship
round so get ready I wanted to start it
now we just have a couple days left of
February which is crazy it's such a
short month but we just have a couple
weeks left of February and then we'll go
through all of March so I thought it
would be fun for March Madness if you're
not familiar with what March Madness is
it is it's for the men's college
basketball tournament the n-c-double-a
tournament and I love March Madness I'm
not a huge college basketball fan but I
fill up my branch every single year and
I watch those basketball games because
it's something about them they just are
really exciting so I thought it would be
fun to do makeup-wise I hope that you
guys are excited for it but if you are
ready to jump into it why don't we go
ahead and get started with the first
category the first category is of course
going to be primer I'm just gonna kind
of work in the way that I would do my
makeup so today's video is mostly
focused on face so starting with primer
I have a four for each category like I
said the first one here is one of my
newer primers to me but I absolutely
love this primer this is from flower
beauty it is the in your prime hydrating
primer it is $12.99 this is a newer
product to me but from the first time I
used it I was like mmm mmm do I enjoyed
this primer I really dry skin right now
I live in Iowa we are the depths of
winter and it is very chilly outside the
Chili's putting it nicely and my skin
has become a really dry and this gives
me such a boost of hydration and so
worked well for me under so many of my
foundations so I really really enjoyed
this one from flower beauty another
primer that is newer to me but I had to
include it in this video because I know
a lot of you guys like it - this is from
Smashbox and this is the a photo finish
a primer riser
I have a mini which was $15 the
full-size does run for $42 I have used
this now three or four times it has not
been a lot of times that I have used
this but it does something to my skin
that makes it look so good but my
foundations over this primer like people
who say that a primer doesn't really do
anything you have not found the right
primer and I'm saying that as someone
who used to say primers don't do
anything and I used to not wear them
every single foundation I have tried
with this primer has applied so easily
has it looked so good on my skin and I
am loving loving this primer thank you
to everyone who is recommending it to me
then the last two are kind of like my
ogia staples I tried to do two drugstore
and two high-end in each category that
was kind of my goal so it's not like
these are like my absolute top four
which actually the primers might be but
I really tried to do two and two to just
try to even it out have a nice balance
you know what I'm saying but the next
one here is from number seven and this
is their air brush away primer this has
been one of my favorites for a very long
time I believe this is around the twenty
dollar mark I want to say just under
twenty dollars this is a really nice
primer it's very moisturizing on the
skin as well and it just makes the skin
look a little bit smoother like just a
little bit softer and a little bit
smoother this has been one of my
favorites like I said for a very long
time so I did want to include it and
then the last one I have here is from
amazing cosmetics it's the anti-aging
face primer this is a pretty pricy
primer it's $35 s so still the Smashbox
full-size would be the most expensive in
this category but this is pretty pricey
at $35 but again it's been a favorite of
mine for a very long time it has more of
a silicone feel to it which isn't always
my favorite but I really like the way
that this one makes the skin look as
well and again this is another one where
foundations sit really nicely on top of
this one kind of no matter what
foundation I'm going for it's gonna look
really nice on the skin so again this
has been in my collection for a while
and one of my favorites for a while so
those are the four primers that you get
to choose from which one would you want
to see my face which one would you
consider a favorite which one would you
be most interested in trying again head
of the community tab place your votes
let me know which primary you want
moving over to the
nation and category the first foundation
I have here is actually the one that I'm
wearing today this is from covergirl
it's the vitalist healthy elixir this
one is about 1199 depending on where you
get it because it is drugstore I guess
that I am wearing it today and this
foundation I have been so impressed with
I mean I don't know if you can tell from
my poor little bottle but this has
gotten a lot of love from me my shade
that I have here is in let me tell you
natural beige I just really enjoyed this
foundation I like the packaging I like
that it has a pump it has a really nice
a coverage to it it's it's a medium to
full coverage to me it leaves a little
bit more medium unless I do prefer to
build it up which actually today I did
build it up I did do two layers of this
foundation I really like the way it
makes the skin look it just is like my
skin but it looks better it looks
smoother it covers imperfections well
but it's not too heavy on me but I
really do like the coverage that a gift
so this is one of my favorite
foundations another foundation that's
been a favourite of mine for quite some
time is the number-7 stay perfect
foundation this is about $15.99 I have
two different shades I go back and forth
between cool beige and then warm beige I
think cool beige is the one that I wear
in the winter time I want to say again
this has a really nice medium coverage
to it the only thing that I don't love
about this foundation is that I notice
when I wear it all day I can get kind of
like oily looking by the end of the day
which is strange because I have dry skin
but even now in the winter especially
when I'm super dry I still kind of have
that like Sheena to me by the end of the
day so I have to make sure if I'm
wearing this out that I just make sure
that I have a powder in my purse with me
and I just powder my face and it looks
fine but other than that I really like
the coverage that it gives and I think
that this is a really nice drugstore
foundation as well and then for the high
end foundation this one from Lancome is
the 10th eabdul foundation this one
actually reminds me a lot of the number
7 thing if you've been wanting to try
the Lancome but you don't want to spend
the forty seven dollars on it the number
seven is a really good option for it but
I do like the Lancome one just a little
bit more I don't notice that it gives me
that kind of like sheen at the end of
the day I think when I put it on and how
it wears it stays put throughout the day
it doesn't do like any sort of like
changes to my skin like I said it is $47
it has a nice medium to full coverage as
well I do have two shades in this one
this one is 310 bisque cool I think it's
this one is and then I also do have a
bisque form as well but this is the one
that I tend to wear in the winter time
also but this has been one of my
favorite foundations for quite some time
it does have a nice pump on it as well
and I have gone through quite a bit of
this one and then the other one is this
was like a YouTube made me buy it I
started here and everyone chatting about
it it's a fifty dollar foundation so I
purchased it during the Sephora vib sale
but I love this foundation I do not
regret buying it because the Dior Dior
skin forever foundation I'm in the shade
at zero three zero and this is it really
really nice foundation this went to me
it's still on medium to full but it
pulls more on the full side at least for
me I know when I'm putting it on it's
really covering up anything if I have a
day where I've been breaking out quite a
bit or I just have a lot of like
imperfections or redness on my skin I'll
reach for this one because it's covering
everything but it's leaving my skin with
a really nice finish and its toes it
stays this foundation is not going
anywhere it's very very long-lasting
it's the priciest foundation I think
it's right at $50 I want to say it was
but it definitely is one of my favorites
so those are the four foundations that I
put in the foundation category which one
do you want to see move to the next
round so in next up we have the
concealer category so first up is one of
my newer concealers to me this is from
Catrice cosmetics it's their liquid
camouflage high coverage concealer this
is only $5.99 my shade is in light beige
I picked this up from Ulta this is one
of my newer concealers to me but I have
tried it out several times and I think
it is pretty good it doesn't have the
most amount of coverage which it sells
it's high coverage and sometimes when I
use it and especially when I watch me
back on camera I can tell like I can
still see like dark circles are just
kind of like sometimes my circles aren't
like super dark but they're just they're
noticeable they're there and I can tell
that my eyes still kind of look tired
sometimes when I wear this concealer so
I wish it had just a little like a
little bit more coverage for me but I
still do like it and for $5.99 I don't
think that's a bad price the next one
here is the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow
so honestly when I was looking at my
concealer collection and picking them
out I actually had more high-end
concealers that picked out but I really
wanted to have two in two in each
category so I ended up shoes
the L'Oreal infallible this isn't my
personal favorite concealer I still do
like it and I still do use it it's just
it's not my absolute fave my shade is in
creamy natural which I actually think is
a little bit too dark for me I don't
know it's just something about this I
don't necessarily love the smell of the
concealer it doesn't bother me I think
I've heard some people say it kind of
like stings their eyes if they can't
wear it coz it stings their eyes so much
it doesn't sting my eyes which is kind
of weird me because I do have sensitive
eyes and I just would have assumed that
it would have bothered me it doesn't
bother me in that sense but I just I
again I don't feel like it has the most
coverage I don't even feel like it
really gives my under eyes like a really
nice glow like I have other radiant
concealers that I feel like actually
make the under eyes appear a little like
brighter just more radiant in general
this one I don't quite see it but it's
okay like it's it's not okay concealer
for me and then the next two that I have
here this one is from my Kevin uh Quan
this is called their I always get the
neighborhood the supernatural concealer
a couple different shades here this one
is the EC corrector and then I think I
also have white I want to say for the
Kevin of Kwan's these are one of my
favorite concealers this one that I do
find very similar to the Tarte shape
tape what everyone was like trying to
find a dupe for the shape tape I was
like why is someone talking about the
Kevin Kwan concealer because this is
really good I'm sorry if you can hear
Aerys snoring she's right next to me I'm
dreaming about chasing birds or
something is going on over there in her
dreams
a really nice a concealer it is a very
full coverage it is a touch on the drier
side so when I apply this I do one under
eye first make sure it's all blended out
set it and then I do the other eye blend
it out set it very nice it's covering
everything for me it's covering dark
circles it's giving my under eyes and
nice lift I really like this concealer
it's $30 it's kept in a quad and it's
pricey but it's freakin good freaking
good of course I had to include my
favorite concealer in here duh this is
the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer
again a pricy concealer this one is $29
but it is just one of my favorites I
have the shade like neutral and I think
I have another shade as well but mostly
light neutral is what I use love this
concealer this one replaced my Tarte
shape tape for me I mention it and might
be throw into makeup products it
replaced my Tarte shaped Kate for me
once I started trying this I was like
wait what does this concealer rocks fine
it kind of similar
the Kevin O Kwan as well but I think
having a Kwan is more full coverage but
this one is still very full coverage but
sometimes it doesn't
maybe intimidate me as much I don't have
to work as quickly with this one as I do
with the Kevin of Kwan I can lay down
the concealer on my under eyes and take
my time blending him out without having
to worry about it being hard to blend I
don't find a lot of creasing with this
concealer I do still set all of my
concealers but with this one I don't
have to like with the Kevin of Kwan I
blend it out and then immediately set it
otherwise it can have some creasing this
one I don't really find that with it and
I just love the way it makes my under
eyes looks it just smooths everything
out it gives them just a brighter
appearance and I really do enjoy that so
the Urban Decay Naked skin is my
favorite but those are the four
concealers to choose from which ones
which ones do you want to see go to
round to the like I mentioned when I was
talking about concealers I do always a
set my under eyes have two powders to
talk about and then two baking powders
so pressed powder and a loose powder
there we go to talk about
okay so first up from the drugstore I
have this one from wet and wild this is
there at mega Glo contouring a palette
and I have the dulce de leche it does
come with a contour shade as well and
then the setting powder and I actually
like the setting powder and this one
even more than the contour powder I
reached forward a ton it's a really nice
brightening powder I really enjoy it and
this guy is about $5.99 which is awesome
this is actually my second one and then
the loose powder that I have from the
drugstore is this one from a pixi by
petra this is one of my favourite loose
powders I definitely prefer a pressed
powder nowadays versus a loose powder
which if you talked to me last year it
would have been flipped but this one
from pixie is actually really nice it is
$20 pixie is a little bit higher for a
drugstore brand I actually really do
enjoyed this powder what I do is I twist
the cap off and then I can dip my Beauty
Blender into this bottom part here it
does also come with a puff applicator
but I don't really like that and I don't
really find that it does anything so I
don't use that part but I really like
the way this that this looks it applies
really nicely to the under eyes and it
doesn't leave a white cast on me which I
enjoy so much and it just holds the
makeup in place for a very long time if
I'm going out for a while or I have like
a special event to go to a lot of times
I find myself reaching for this one from
pixie the other loose powder I have is
one of my like og favorites this is from
Laura Mercier it's the speaker
brightening powder
was one of my first ever like baking
powders that I bought when the baking
craze was like introduced to YouTube but
everybody was like you want to spike
your face and I was like obviously I
must make my face this one is a $28 but
it is it is really nice I quite enjoyed
this one quite a bit definitely is more
frightening than the pixie one I just
have to make sure that when I dusted
away it that I really make sure I've
dust all of the excess of white
otherwise I can have flashback problems
but as long as I get everything extra
off my face I don't have a problem with
that and again it sets everything really
well but I especially even last year I
was obsessed with like super super
bright but right under eyes and this
Laura Mercier powder she did the job
this one it was $28 I believe it was if
I didn't say the price and then the last
one I have here is a palette this is
from my Kat Von D it's the shade unlike
contour palette this guy is $49 and you
have different setting powders in here
and then also contour and bronzer shades
you'll see this in the next couple of
videos as well because this palette this
has been like one of my staples my
friend Candice sent it to me one is yeah
I loved I love this palette I think it's
fantastic the setting powder that I use
the most is this one right here so that
is the one that I would use if this is
chosen for the final video that's the
setting powder that I use for this one
but I really enjoyed the palette as well
$49 for the whole thing so that is
everything for the setting powders and
the final categories for my first March
Madness makeup style video so those are
the first of four categories and the
four items in each category that you get
to vote for you get to vote for one item
of course and then I will take the top
two from each category and we will move
it over to the second round check back
next Monday I should have another March
of men this video and like I said this
series is going to last us for quite
some time it should take us through
March but I hope that you guys are
excited for it I thought it was a really
fun idea something to be interactive but
with some things that are going on in my
life right now I've been trying to kind
of come up with more video ideas and
because I'm someone who really enjoys
talking about makeup I thought this was
a fun way to pull out some of my
favorite items and even some some that
are not my favorite and just be able to
talk about them give these short little
reviews on them but at the same time
have that interaction and see what you
guys would want to see what would you
look for what is your favorite and
come up with the majority vote I think
that just sounds like a lot of fun and
to do with the March Madness style that
we'll have another round I just thought
it could be a fun idea so I hope that
you guys like this idea I hope that you
will participate and vote and I hope
that I will see you next week before the
next up in March of madness video but if
you guys did enjoy this one and you're
excited for the series I hope that
you'll give this video a thumbs up I
hope that you will also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys in tomorrow's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
