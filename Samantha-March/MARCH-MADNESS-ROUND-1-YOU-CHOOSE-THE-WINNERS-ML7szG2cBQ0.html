today's video is going to be the second
video in my March Madness series thank
you guys so much for all the love and
the excitement on last week's March
Madness video if you haven't seen that
one I will have it listed down below and
I just was overwhelmed at how excited
people seemed for this video idea I
really had no idea if it was gonna go
over well or not if it was going to be
too confusing but is gonna make any
sense at all and your comments and
feedback and the excitement has me even
more excited for this series so again if
you missed the first one basically for
the next couple Monday's here throughout
the rest of February and then throughout
March I'm going to be doing the March
Madness series I have different
categories of makeup I have four
products in each category picked out I'm
going to talk a little bit about them
and then head over to my community tab
and you get to vote on your favorite and
then I'm taking at the top two favorites
from each category and then we're gonna
go to a round two you will want to stay
tuned to round 2 because round two I do
have a giveaway involved in there I was
waiting to see if this would go over
well and if people liked the idea and
since you do the giveaway is gonna
happen to run around two kicks off so
you want to stick back for that and then
after round two and after the voting I'm
gonna do a full face of all the products
that my subscribers chose for me so
that's kind of how March Madness goes
again I have a little bit more detail in
the first video so of course that will
be in the description box but today I
have four more categories for you and
four more items in each category we're
finishing off the face today with
contour bronzer blush and also highlight
so if you are ready to see the
categories and the products and see
which ones you want to vote to get to
round 2 why don't I go ahead and get
started
alright so I'm going to kick it off with
contour so I was trying to include two
drugstore or slash affordable and then
two high-end in each category and this
is one where I couldn't do it I actually
realized going through my collection
that I don't have a ton of contour
shades which honestly didn't make me mad
because I basically have you know one
contour shade so why would I need to
have like fifty different products of
contour I don't know so I realized that
and I realize most of my contour shades
are more high-end so I do have the one
drugstore option here is from what and
while it's the
mega glue contouring palette this is
also in my setting powder category as
well but I also really do enjoyed the
contour powder on this side also so this
duo from wet and wild this will be
included in two different categories but
I did want to include it in the contour
category as well and the categories like
I picked out like some things are my
favorites and some things I just maybe
there are an older product I want to
bring back a newer product I wanted to
showcase things like that but it's not
necessarily my favorites because this
isn't about me it's about you you guys
are the ones voting you guys are the
ones picking the final product so that's
kind of how that I don't know that's
kind of my thought process when I was
picking products it's just it's not
necessarily my favorites some categories
are my favorites some are not some are
new some are old I just want to see what
you guys end up voting for I think
that's pretty fun this one in here is a
newer one to me and this is from the
balm it's the take home with the bronze
bronzer and I use the shade Oscar as a
contour shade and I actually have it as
my contour shade today so I wanted to
include this one this is a newer one
from the balm but I have really been
enjoyed these I use Oscar as my contour
shade and then I think it's tawny
that I use as my bronzer shade and these
are really really nice powders I've
really been liking them so I thought I'd
mention it in here it's a newer product
I know I tested it out in a first
impression video but I don't have my
full review yet but I want to come on
and say I'm really up quite like this
quite a bit but this is a really good
contour shade for my particular skin
tone next one I have here is from Italy
Kat Von D shade and light palette again
this is also in the setting powder
category and I said that you would see
it again in another video and this is
the shade that I use as a contour shade
and I really really enjoyed this palette
I enjoy this palette overall I use it
for setting powders for contour and also
for bronzer and I just really like this
palette so if a Kat Von D is chosen this
is the contour shade that would be in
there and then the final one that I have
is from a Kevyn Aucoin and it's the
sculpting powder of course I love the
Kevyn Aucoin
a sculpting powder I know this is a
favorite of a lot of people's this is
the sculpting powder right here this is
the contour book - I believe it's what
it's called and I just I love the
sculpting powder
thus I reach for it a ton so those are
the four contours that will be in this
category again the voting will be in the
community tab if you go to my YouTube
page at my home page on YouTube you
should see some tabs at the top it'll
say like about playlist videos you
should also see community that is where
the voting will be I know some people
who are saying that you couldn't
necessarily find it on your iPad's I
think it was so there might be an issue
there with iPads but I think everywhere
else desktop I can find it on my desktop
and I can also find it on my Android
phone but it might depend on what device
you're using but if you head to the
community tab the voting will be there
and I close the voting on Friday so you
have up until Friday to vote it'll close
on Friday and then we go to round 2 I'm
just going to be taking the top 2 from
each category so make sure to choose
your favorites in each category and
those are the four contour shades they
get to choose from so try to wear my
estate shirt today I live in Iowa Center
myself and Iowa State Cyclones and I'm
mostly we live really close to Ames and
but I'm also just like an Iowa fan in
general especially like when it does
come to March Madness or like bowl games
or anything like that for football
I just cheer I'll cheer for Iowa State
actually for Iowa I cheer for you and I
like I'm just an Iowa fan but if you
were to ask me like if I was gonna go to
the Iowa I was thinking which is a
really big deal here at Iowa if you were
to ask me what color I'm wearing I'm
wearing red I'd be a fun sure to pull
out for today what college team do you
cheer for I would love to know leave
that in the comments next up I have the
bronzer category so I wanted to include
this a little guy here this is from ELF
it's one of their face duos and this is
in Saint Lucia I wanted to pull this out
because this is a favorite of mine for
so long and I feel like I've very rarely
reached for it anymore because I'm
always reaching like the newer products
and stuff and trying to get reviews in
and all of that so I wanted to include
it and mostly just to bring it out of my
collection I'm going to pull it to the
front and remind myself to use it it has
a bronzer and a blush slash highlight
kind of depending on my skin tone I can
use it as either but it is a really nice
powder bronzer in here and it has a nice
mirror and these are like four or five
dollars from elf like their face duals
are really good and really affordable
the other
bronzer that I
I chose this because it's in my project
pan 2018 my finish 18 and 2018 is the
physician's formula butter bronzer and
mmm I'm not like I worried this a lot I
always like all of my makeup in the
description box and I feel like they're
so often run like physicians for me
about every one of the butter runs there
but I'm trying okay I know a lot of
people say this is hard to paint but I'm
gonna give it a shot but this is a
really nice bronzer so I wanted to put
it in here and then the two high end
options I have this is a favorite
bronzer of mine it has been for a while
this is the urban decay beach bronzer I
just really like this bronzer man and I
like it especially in the winter which
is kind of funny because it's called the
beach bronzer but it's more of a lighter
shade for me I don't know how similar is
it to the butter bronzer actually it
might be really mmm no I think this one
is still a little bit darker this is a
pretty light bronzer so I also do like
using this in the winter which is why I
want to keep using it right now until we
get to the the summer months or I'm a
bit Tanner and I need a bit more for my
bronzer so I like to use the butter
bronzer in the winter but this is also
pretty light so I do like to use it in
the winter as well but I just really
like this bronzer it's really nice and
smooth apply is really nice and I just I
like the bronze that it gives me so
that's the urban decay one and then the
other one is a newer product to me as
well but I really really like this
bronzer too but this is from a Becca
this is the Capri Coast bronzer when I
got this I wouldn't I went through a
phase I went through quite a phase with
this bronzer it's just really beautiful
again a little bit on the lighter side
so I like it for the winter it almost
has like a little bit of a sheen to it
but I just
mmm something about this bronzer i I
can't put it down for a very long time
so I do like Becca's Capri coast so make
sure to head to the community tab vote
which bronzer do you want to see and run
to moving over to the blush at category
I really wanted to include this blush
and I feel like I've been reaching for
it so much lately this is another one
that I'm like oh I wore that essence
blush again the other day okay but this
is the essence silky touch blush and
this isn't the shade babydoll I just
really like this blush and I've been
reaching for it quite a bit lately it's
just a really nice really light pink
blush but these essence blushes are also
super inexpensive I want to say it's
like $2.99 because I've been linking
quite a bit in my description box I keep
going to also to grab the link I'm like
really three dollars for that blush like
dang you know I was just talking the
other day about how about that Burt's
Bees from CVS nose ten dollars for a
single blush this essence one is three
dollars so I think that's pretty awesome
but I really do like this blush so I
wanted to include it and give us love
and then the other one of course is a
cult favorite a staple this is from
Milani this is luminoso I feel like
everybody on YouTube has like talked
about this blush at some point or
another it's a really nice peachy blush
with a kind of a gold Sheen to it it's
one of my favorite blushes for spring
summertime especially but also just a
favorite blush in general I love
Luminoso and then the to high-end
options that I picked out one is a blush
that I I became very obsessed with very
quickly this is from Becca cosmetics
this is the flower child blush I like so
many of Becca face products it is unreal
from the bronzers to the blushes to the
highlights like man just oh I have her
foundation on today well would you look
at that didn't plan that but this is the
flower child a blush it's a really
pretty kind of like pinky orange blush
again with a bit of a sheen to it
and it is beautiful I love flower child
and then the other one I have is my real
real fancy bougie blush that I thought I
would pull in here this is from
hourglass and this is the ambient
lighting blush and ethereal glow yes it
is I really do like this blush actually
I got a Scalia bond and I wasn't sure I
was like oh I'll just give it a try and
see what I think and I actually ended up
really liking it it's such a soft glow
to the skin but it looks really really
nice I like the really light pink glow
it gives to the cheeks I don't think it
works with every makeup look out there
but sometimes like I'll do a look and
I'll be like you know what it just calls
it calls for ethereal glow so I thought
I'd mentioned that in there give a
little bit of my thoughts on this
hourglass blush but those are the four
choices that I picked out in the blush
category let me know who do you want to
be the winner and then the final
category to focus on is highlight and I
noticed when I pulled out my highlight
choices that I kind of went for ones
that I think maybe people won't be
expecting I love highlights
I love highlights and I have a lot for
highways
but I try to not go with like the new
and now right now and I tried to do
maybe some products that I feel like are
underrated as well right but the first
two from the drugstore this first one
here is the essence appeared nude
highlight I don't know if I would
necessarily say I feel like this one
doesn't get a lot of love because I feel
like I hear a lot about it but maybe not
as much as they could and again it's
from essence and it's super super
affordable and I really like this one
it's definitely more of like a sheer
glow or like that glow from within tight
but you can build it up I pulled it out
the other day did kind of like a soft
glow and then a little bit later I was
like you know what no and I came back
and built it up just fine but this is a
really nice a drugstore option the
essence of pure glow and then the other
one I have is from Jake at beauty and
this is the you a glow girl baked
highlighter and I have mine in Bella
Rose again a more affordable highlight I
think the essence one is still gonna be
the most affordable this highlight is
really mind-blowing to me it's Anna it's
kind of like a lavender shift to it it's
kind of like that iridescent before
iridescent highlights became like kind
of the craze and I just think it's a
really beautiful highlight I don't
really hear a lot of people talk about
jcat in general but especially these
highlights and they are really really
good highlights so I thought I would
include that in there because a lot of
times our reach for this when I kind of
want like a funky highlight I find
myself going for the J cap and then the
other two I have are both highlight
palettes this first one here is from a
Smashbox this was the collaboration with
Casey Holmes the spotlight palette and I
have mine in Pearl I love this palette
so much and I think it's so beautiful
and I've been finding myself more and
more lately of reaching for it like I
have it right out instead of being kind
of like tucked away with all my other
highlights like organized nicely I have
it pulled out of the container and
sitting right on my bookshelf because I
want to remember to keep using this one
because I think it's a really gorgeous
highlight palette I think that Casey did
a great job designing this one and I
think it's beautiful so I wanted to
include the spotlight palette and Pearl
and then the other palette that I chose
is because it's a newer one but I feel
like I really didn't hear anybody talk
about this and I freaking love this
palette this is the appear highlight
palette and this is a gorgeous palette
again it's a newer release I think it's
called the pure pro or pure on the go
highlight pal
one or the other but it has six shades
in here and it's a really nice highlight
palette and I think it was only like
thirty dollars I want to say or
something like that for six shades which
I didn't think that I was a bad price
for you know a more high-end highlight
palette because sometimes they can be
even more pricing for less shades but I
really like this palette as well
especially this first shade in here
which is called Twilight is I mean I can
tell just looking at this but that's
definitely like my most used shade in
here but I really like this palette too
and I didn't feel like I've heard a lot
of people talking about it so I thought
I could throw it in this video and show
it some love but that's the final
category that I have for today's video
these are the four highlights that you
