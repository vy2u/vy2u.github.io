round 2 so this week and then also next
Monday I'm just gonna split up the four

subscribers chose for me and I'll also
be announcing the giveaway winner in
that video as well so if you are ready
to kick off around 2 of my March Madness
series and si has your back over busted
are you on the right track let's go
ahead and get started so in the primer
category I was pretty excited to see two
of my favorite primers that made it this
one from a flower beauty this is the
hydrating primer just one of my favorite
primers I think it just so well and
hydrating the skin and this one is newer
to me but it was one that I kind of like
instantly fell in love with I was pretty
excited to see a flower beauty that one
had 21% of the vote of the votes because
this Smashbox a photo finish primer
risers had 64 percent of the votes a lot
of people seem very excited for the
Smashbox photo finish primer eyes
this is one of my favorite primers hands
down like this would be like top two to
three primers I think this is a
fantastic primer its hyaluronic acid in
it it just makes you look so hydrated
and just so good every foundation that I
put on almost almost there's one Revlon
one that did not look good at all but
other than that every other foundation
just looks so well on top of this primer
it just does such great things so I was
so excited to see that one but really
these two these are two of my favorite
primers so I thought that was pretty
cool so they'll have to let me know
which one do you want to see in the
finale for foundation I thought it was
interesting that both drugstore picks
actually was chosen so 26% of the votes
went to this one from a covergirl this
is the vitalist healthy elixir
foundation again one of my favorite
foundations I love the way that this
looks on the skin it's such a natural
finish but it's like your skin but
better when I wear this - so I was
excited to see the covergirl and then
also number 7 this one had a 30% of the
votes
this is the stay perfect foundation this
one actually kind of surprised me that
it was the top choice because I feel
like number seven is it talked about as
much as some other brands so I thought
that was pretty cool to see because I
really do like this foundation it's a
really similar foundation to the Lancome
tented Dole Foundation which is actually
on my face today one of my favorite
foundations but it's drugstore and it's
more affordable so I thought that was
pretty cool to see both drugstore
options at for foundation for concealer
31% of the votes went to this one from a
Catrice is a liquid camouflage concealer
I honestly was pretty surprised that
this one got as many votes as it did I
know a lot of people talk about this one
and I bought it because so many people
were recommending it to me or asking
like comparison wise to the Catrice and
I didn't have it yet and when I went to
purchase it I was really shocked to see
that it only had three shades of
concealer and they were basically the
same shade I really didn't know what I
was supposed to do with that when I was
purchasing this so I don't I guess I was
just surprised to see it get so many
votes I put it in there because I really
I wanted to and for the most part most
categories are too horrible too high-end
I just wanted to have a nice
in there and I just didn't have a lot of
affordable concealers in my collection
when I was doing that video so I put the
Catrice in there but I mean hey it got
31 percent of the votes I know a lot of
people really do like this one so yeah
the Catrice is in there and then the one
that won out was the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer at 46% this to me is my
number one concealer so I thought it was
pretty cool to see than there again this
isn't about my favourites because I'm
not voting you guys are voting you wrote
in for your favorites but that was
pretty cool to see because I love this
concealer replaced my Tarte shape tape
for me when I first tried it out and
it's still my number one concealer so
that one was pretty cool to see and then
moving on to powder for like my under
eyes because that's the stuff that I
don't skip the Kat Von D shade in like
pallet got 31 percent of the votes
so this palette has some setting shades
in here and then also a contour and a
bronzer this first shade here is what I
use to set my under eyes with so that
one got 31 percent and then just barely
edging it by with 32 percent was the
laura mercier secret brightening powder
I did not I honestly did not expect it
to see this one because a lot of people
don't talk about the secret brightening
powder they talk about the translucent
powder from Laura Mercier but I recently
did get that one but this is what I've
had for a very long time I purchased it
a couple of years ago and I actually I
do really like this one I don't use the
loose powders as much as I once did but
I still think this is a really nice
powder and it really does brighten up
the under eyes but like not too crazy
looking but yeah I thought that was
interesting I was surprised I was
surprised to see this be the number one
choice don't moving on to contour with
27% of the boat went to the wet and wild
contour palette I have mine and dulce de
leche obviously this is the contour
shade this is a really nice palette this
is the second one I have the first one
unfortunately shattered when I was
traveling and I went right out and
repurchased it because this is just like
a staple in my collection I love both of
the powders in here that contour is
moving on with 27% and then also we've
got the Kat Von D shade + light back in
here this one out at 41% this is the
shade that I use as my contour shade I
really enjoyed this palette I think it's
fantastic
I have setting shades in here contour
and bronzer so I thought that was pretty
cool to see it went out in the contour
category and then for bronzer let's see
here we have at 17% this one here from
Becca cosmetics
this is the Capri Coast bronzer I love
this bronzer this is one of my favorite
bronzers and one that I reach for so
often I just think it's such a smooth
and beautiful bronzer and it's good for
me right now like I just feel like it
just matches my skin tone really well
with a little bit more like paler vibes
happening here but I just I love this
one Capri Coast I think is so pretty but
the big winner in that category at 64%
was the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer I I did not expect to see such a
big difference between the first and
second place bronzer in this one but it
seems like a lot of people were pretty
excited for this Physicians Formula
bronzer this is also a really nice
bronzer it's pretty light and I have to
shave medium no I have to shave like I'm
the shade light it is fairly light on
the skin so I kind of have to use a bit
of a heavier hand but this one is also
in my 2018 project pan which I really do
need to film my checking video for and
I'm not doing great I don't really see
much of difference at all and I use this
one quite a bit like I said I do have to
do a couple passes about that because it
is light on me but still I like this
bronzer I like the way it smells I think
it looks good on the skin but yeah this
one really really took the cake in the
bronzer category at 64% and in just two
more categories a for blush coming in
with 25% of the votes was a flower child
from Becca cosmetics this was a blush
that when I got it first started trying
it out I was just like mmm this blush is
so pretty has a little bit of shimmer to
it it's kind of like a pinky peach blush
with some shimmer it just looks so
beautiful Becca space products are just
so so pretty I'm so I was excited to see
that flower child is moving on and then
with 45 percent of the votes this one I
can't say I'm super surprised
this isn't Milani Luminoso this one was
a YouTube made me buy it so many people
seem to really enjoy this peachy
shimmery gold blush that's just so
beautiful and I totally understand it so
again not surprised to see this one run
away with the votes in the blush
category with 45% now the highlight
category I thought was pretty
interesting
so with 33% of the votes was the
Smashbox palette in collaboration with
Casey Holmes this is the Pearl palette
that I have so inside you get three
different shades of highlight and also a
mirror this is one of my favorite
highlighting palates I continually reach
for it I actually don't even have it set
out with my other highlights I don't
have a put away with my other highlights
I haven't pulled out to the front
because I just like using it that much
that I don't even bother to like put it
back in this little spot I just have it
out in the front of my bookshelf because
I think it's so beautiful
Casey Holmes this one of my favorite
influence there's all round so I really
do enjoy this palette but what I thought
was interesting that at 50% of the votes
went to this one from essence the pure
nude highlighter I just thought this was
interesting because essence I don't feel
like I mean they're well-known brand I
think but I don't feel like I hear a ton
like an overwhelming amount about
essence I don't feel like I see
everybody reaching for this highlight
because it's more of a subtle highlight
and I think a lot of people possibly
myself included kind of reach or share
more about like they're really blinding
highlights and I don't know this one
this one caught me off guard singing at
50% but I really do like this highlight
it is more subtle but you can build it
up if you want something more foreign
from your cheekbones it's really
beautiful I do like this highlight but
yeah that is the final product to share
for this first round 2 video so you want
to make sure it head to the community
tab and vote for the product that you
want to see in the finale ok so then
it's going to be everything for today's
