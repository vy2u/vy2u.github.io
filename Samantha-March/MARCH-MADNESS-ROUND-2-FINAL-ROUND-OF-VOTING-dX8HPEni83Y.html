today's video is going to be the second
and final round
to video in my March Madness series if
you have not caught my March Madness
series is almost over which is super sad
for me but I have been doing a March
Madness series here on my channel I'll
have the other videos listed down below
basically what was happening was I was
going through a bunch of different
makeup categories I think we had 16 I
was giving a four categories in each and
letting people choose from the community
tab choose their top picks in each
category and then I took the top two
most voted on in each category and
that's what we are doing here in round
two I am sharing at the top two choices
in each of these our final categories
and then I will ask you guys to vote
again one more time to vote and then I
will take that top product in each
category and then next week's video on
Monday is going to be a full face using
all of the makeup that my subscribers
chose for me so next week is the finale
video which I'm so excited about I also
did a little giveaway in here with the
March Madness video I had people fill
out a bracket about two weeks ago and
you chose the the product in each
category that you thought was going to
be the winner and whoever gets the most
correct is going to win a prize I will
have my giveaway video listed down below
brackets are closed of course because
we're already into round 2 now so I'm
excited to see who will win that video
and I'm excited for next week's video to
do the full face with all of the winning
products in here but this is going to be
the next around 2 videos so I have eight
more categories I'm going to show you
the top of two products that are moving
along you can check your brackets see
how you're going and then also make sure
to head to the community to have it to
vote if you go to my youtube channel
you'll see some tabs at the top sub just
videos and playlists about and if you
click on the community tab it'll let you
vote voting does closed on Friday so I
will have some time to look at all of
the tallies and then be able to film the
video that will go up on Monday so I am
super excited about that but if you are
ready for another round 2 video in March
Madness why don't we go ahead and get
started I am filming on opening day for
the Cubs I got my Cubs at Jersey on I
don't know if anyone has noticed but
I've tried to wear a sports shirt during
each of these March Madness videos March
Madness system
from the NCAA college basketball
tournament so it was kind of like a play
on March Madness a play on the name of
course and all of that but I've tried to
wear a sports shirt in every single one
of these videos and I'm kind of running
down there this is a jersey that I've
had for so many years and it's like a
from like the junior boy section but we
make it work I can't actually button it
time to our shirt underneath though in
fact we make it work okay so starting
off with the eye primer category because
I feel like this is an important
category the elf primer moving on at 23%
this it doesn't say the name on it but
it's like their shadow LOC primer and
it's like two bucks took one on the bus
i shadow primers and it's super
affordable and then the winner in the
round one category and moving on is from
urban decay and this is their primer
potion and this is the original primer
potion this one with 61 percent so you
have to let me know which eye shadow
primer you want to see winning for the
eyeshadow palette I was really excited
for this because I had no idea like I
truly had no idea I did fill out a
bracket myself and I didn't even check
it last week oh I was gone I was on
vacation that's why I didn't check it I
need a check and see how I'm doing but
I'm pretty sure I'm not doing well I
like I'm fairly confident I'm not doing
well but let me see it Louis 24 percent
was the color pop all I see is magic
palette so I was pretty excited to see
this one because I really really do like
this palette I really enjoy these color
pop it pressed eyeshadow palettes and I
just I really enjoyed that all I see is
magic I think it's really pretty and you
got a lot of different options in here
so that one is a choice and then winning
with 39% was color grain Queen of Hearts
I'm not super shocked about this one
guys not super shocked about this one a
lot of people really love the Queen of
Hearts palette from color grain so not
surprised to see that so which eyeshadow
palette do you want to see me use the
finale video do you wanna see color pop
you want to see color green already for
the eyeliner I was not really surprised
to see these two options moving on with
28% we have the liner from Marc Jacobs
the high liner this one is in overt
which is a really pretty green I
actually do have it in my waterline
today and then the winner from round one
is the Urban Decay 24/7 glide on pencil
in deep end this one with 39% of
not surprised to see colorful liners
when a green and a really beautiful blue
so those are the aligner choices and
then for brows I was pretty excited to
see this at for brows we had the
Maybelline brow definer at 28% this is
one of my favorite brow products right
now so I was happy to see that one and
then another one of my favorites is the
benefit precisely of my brow and this
one with 38 percent of the votes so
these are the two eyebrow products thank
you for making it easy on me for when
I'm doing that video but let me know
which brow product you want to see in
the finale for mascara with only 18
percent of the votes that moving on is
the one from Maybelline this is the
total temptation mascara one of my
favorite mascaras I've already bought a
backup of this one because it's just one
of my favorite I think it does amazing
things for your lashes but the big
winner in that category at 65% was from
flower beauty and this is the zoom in
mascara I was really excited to see this
because this is such a good mascara it's
a three-in-one wand you can twist the
wand for length for volume for a curl
this is just a bond mascara I get
another one that I have a backup of yes
these were both in my makeup backup jars
that's so cool I feel like we're on the
same page like from the same page guys
so you have to let me know which mascara
you want to see him on for lipstick I'm
sorry I'm sorry about lipstick winning
at 24% is Mac age sex location if you
guys watched my project pan update video
that I think should have gone up already
on like Friday I'll have it linked down
below I talked about how I can't find
that lipstick I can't find it I put it
somewhere so I could easily find it
because it's one of my favorites and I
use it so much and then I can't remember
where I put it this happens to me all
the time this is not a new story I do
this constantly so I'm still looking for
that lipstick if I can't find it
regardless if it wins or not I'm gonna
buy a new one because it's one of my
favorite news I'm so upset
I'm so upset that I do this but I did
find if you guys remember that I
recently did the same thing with my
buxom lip glosses dolly and White
Russian found him found him so there's
still hope
I'm gonna find age sex location if not
I'll just buy a new one but I'll have a
photo inserted in here so you can see
what it looks like it's just one of my
favorite nudes and then the winner at
44% is from colour-pop in collaboration
with I love Sarah II this is a Reba
it's a beautiful red so I thought that
was kind of cool we have a nude and a
red to decide from so you'll have to let
me know which lip color you want to see
in the finale it also did include a
lashes category as well I typically
always wear lashes not always I
typically usually wear lashes I just I
enjoyed them and I feel like they really
do help a complete look but I thought in
the finale video I would do like show
you guys the look with mascara and then
I would also go ahead and pop on lashes
as well so the last category is actually
kind of interesting because we have a
tie for second place at exactly 27% of
both of these lashes 27 percent that was
the first and only time that happened
throughout the entire March Madness
series so I thought that was interesting
but it is the appear diva lashes some of
my favorite lashes that I love so much
and also the House of lashes these are
the allure Lite lashes so I thought that
was pretty cool so I was trying to
decide I was like should I flip a coin
should i what should I do and I was like
I'll just we'll just include them they
tied they both deserve second place you
know and then the winner in the last
category was actually Hooda Beauty these
are the Samantha lashes I I don't know I
guess I was kind of surprised to see
these but not mad these are some of like
my OG lashes that I used to love so so
much so yeah the Samantha lashes a from
the hooded beauty will also be in there
so a little bit different about the
lashes but you'll have to let me know
which one you want to see in next week's
video and then the final category is for
setting spray I do like to use a setting
spray
so with 27 percent of the votes we had
the pixie glow mist now super surprised
to see this because I know a lot of
people really do like the pixie sprays
the pixie glow mez I bought it because
of the hype around it it definitely
makes you very very dewy and then the
winner in that category was good old mac
fix+ at 43% did not surprised to see
this either I know a lot of people
really enjoyed this this is my og
setting spray and I have a deep fondness
for fix+ it's all you'll have to let me
know how to pixie and Mac which one you
want to see
but after that those are the top two in
the final categories for round two of
March Madness all right guys so that's
gonna be everything a for today's video
those are the top two in each of the
categories again I'll have last week's
round two video listed down below of all
the videos down there but in case you
want to see at the top two and the other
categories and then next week is when I
will be announcing all the winners and
doing the full face and all of that fun
stuff so I'm so excited to see what you
