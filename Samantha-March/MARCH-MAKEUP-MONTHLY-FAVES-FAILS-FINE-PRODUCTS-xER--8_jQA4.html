really excited for today's video because
it's going to be a new series that i
want to kick off here basically this
series is going to replace my monthly
favorites video so you guys know that a
lot of people do mostly favorites at the
end of the month or you know beginning
of the month we go through all the
products that we've been loving on this
month and highlight them and you know
some people now to do like favorites and
fails favorites and blobs favorite
sometimes forgets i think it's called
that I've seen series wise where you
talk about your favorites and then the
products that really didn't work for you
I've been thinking for a while now of
what I could do to also talk about the
products that are in a favorite of mine
but they aren't a sale of mine they're
just fine so what I wanted to do is call
this series the March makeup monthly
march of course being for my name not
for the month or anything like that and
then just the makeup monthly I'm talking
about all of them the makeup that I've
been trying this month I've been getting
more PR packages which is super exciting
to me but not everything falls into a
favorite or a fail category I thought I
could introduce favorites fails and find
product so that way i can tell you guys
and gives my reviews on a lot of
different products instead of just
trying to make a favorites video or just
trying to make a favorites and sales
video so i don't know let me know what
you guys think about it let me know if
you would like this type of video if you
want to see this going forward or if you
just want me to go back to a favorites
video or just let me know your opinions
down below but i thought this would be a
good way to able to include some makeup
that otherwise i wouldn't really talk
about you know like if it's in the fine
category i just don't feel like I would
talk about it as much so I'm going to
try it out I am restoring it off this
month let me know what you guys think in
the comments down below but I'm excited
to share with you the products that I've
been loving on I've not been moving on
and then I thought were decent products
they were just fine one thing that I
want to mention too is that I just got a
p.o box I've been getting asked so many
questions of if I have a p.o box and
when i'll be getting a p.o box and i
finally did get one so that will always
be in my description box down below
though if you want to send me a letter
or anything like that I will have my p.o
box down below as I wanted to make sure
to let you guys know
I have my p.o box I mean my birthday is
coming up if anyone wants to send me
like sympathy cards that would be great
I'm just kidding but I'm carrying 30 and
I'm starting to get a little bit nervous
about it I wasn't nervous about it
before now i'm getting a little bit
nervous well if I me some sympathy cards
for my 30th birthday that would be just
fine but anyways I know that I have a
lot of products when I want to share in
this new series so why don't we go ahead
and jump into it ok I want to start off
with the fine category so these are
products that I didn't love I didn't
hate that they're just kind of like in
the middle for me so I got a really nice
package from a pure cosmetics they
recently came out with new foundations
for the enjoy pier as a brand the
Foundation's me was just kind of like in
the middle of though you know it was
like it was fine it wasn't a foundation
that I felt like really blew me away but
I wasn't like oh no I'm never learned
that again the shade isn't my shade they
sent me blush medium and they sent me a
shade lighter than this and this is
actually too light for me so a lot of
times you'll see me in my Instagram
videos i'm using this but i'm mixing in
a darker foundation as well so it
matches my skin tone a little bit better
but it does its a 12-hour four-in-one
skin perfecting foundation I feel like
it looks nice on the skin it is very
sick though and I'm not a super huge
like Evernote with just putting on
really sick foundation can but kind of
creeped me out a little bit it takes a
little bit longer to blend in I do like
the smell of it like it has a really
nice spin to it like the first time I
used it I was like oh what once that
lovely smell is the foundation I like
the way that it looks it's a little bit
too Matt for me I think it can almost
make my face just like look a little you
know so I feel like I have to really
come in and make sure I'm contouring and
bronzing and highlighting otherwise I
feel like my face just looks a little
bit flat I would say that it's long
wearing though which is good i've tested
it out i mean i don't think i did the
whole like 12 hour thing but i did test
it out for a while and it lasts really
good i didn't have it like breaking up
in anywhere places or anything like that
but again it's just what i would
consider to be like a fine foundation
does another product that was sent to me
that i think is fine this is
from pixie beauteous in collaboration
with it's judy time and it is the
eyeshadow palette so pixi beauty
recently did a collab with for beauty
influencers and they actually sent me
the entire collab I'll have that video
link down below it was one of the most
overwhelming care packages that I've
ever gotten I was absolutely floored I
did a whole video unboxing everything
and swatching and kind of giving my
opinions on them but you saw in that
video if you watched it I wasn't super
blown away by the swatches and that was
really sad because this gold one right
here just looked so beautiful but it was
so super chunky and the fallout was
everywhere and I was really bummed out
about it and other shimmers didn't show
up quite so great these two shades right
here are like beautiful i love wearing
them together and wearing just them on
my eyes and then just putting lashes on
i love that look but every other shade
is just like Nick to me so out of this
palette there's really the only the two
shades that I really really like the
shimmer stirs didn't really show up at
all this one is just mostly like glitter
it's kind of strange and this gold was
like so disappointing to me because I
really wanted a really cool goals for my
lids and that she just did not work out
so as a whole I just didn't love the
palette but I'm not going to get rid of
it because I still do like handful the
shades out of to yourself and this one
was just okay for me I did get a package
last month from too cool for school they
are a skincare brand that can be found
at sephora and they're more of what the
korean beauty type so this they sent me
is there egg mousse soap and I'd like
this I think it's good but again it's
not like I wouldn't put it in a favorite
category but I think it's good and I
wanted to tell you guys about it so it's
really crazy i have an Instagram video I
can leave link down below for me putting
it on but basically when you put it on
it looks like shaving cream it's super
crazy I like it because I don't know
it's just fun to use honestly like it's
a fun experience to use but I don't feel
like it's anything like a lot of times
when I cleanse my face you can like
really tell or you have
a very clean feeling to your skin or
something like that I don't necessarily
feel that way with this a lot of times
when I find myself reaching for this is
when I haven't worn any makeup that day
but I still want to wash my face at
night but I'm not like Oh trying to get
all the makeup off and trying to really
like come onto my skin because I can
wearing foundation all day usually I'm
the no makeup days this is what I use to
clean my face at night and I think it's
doing a good enough job so I still like
it I always the concept behind it I'm
still very sick if you can't tell by my
voice I've been sick for what seems like
forever now so I've been having a lot of
no makeup days or I don't even attempt
to do anything so I've been reaching for
this quite a bit more and i wanted to
mention it to you guys last up in the
fine category i got a package from
amazing cosmetics which I was really
excited for cuz I haven't tried amazing
cosmetics yet so they sent me two
concealers and then also a primer so
this concealer is their amazing
concealer and I selected my shading gold
and ivory and I hear a lot about this
and they say like a lot of like
celebrity makeup artist use this this is
a very very full coverage concealer but
not even like I feel like the tart shape
tape is very full coverage but this
light takes it to a different level you
need like a tiny tiny drop of this or
else you're going to get like and caked
up under eye and I don't really like
thick concealers it's why I like the
dark shape tape because it's still thin
yet it's a full coverage this is just
like full coverage all around so
honestly out of everything out of the
three products that amazing cosmetics
sense I actually like this to lease
which I thought I was probably like this
the most I still like it when I need
more full coverage but now I have
figured out that i need the slightest
amount and to use a damp Beauty Blender
and then I like the way it looks it took
me a little bit to get there a figure
that out i did with the coverage of it
the other concealers that they sent is
there hydrate concealer and this comes
in more of like a stick form where the
other one is more of like the squeeze
tube this one I like because I can tell
it definitely is a hydrating concealer
and I like that dinner it's lighter on
the under eyes but it doesn't have as
much coverage as the amazing concealer
it needs like a
little little bit more coverage for me
so if I'm having a day where I don't
feel like I really need to conceal my
under eyes but I just want to like
brighten up under there or I just need
like boom close coverage like there's a
pinch of coverage I'll go for this I
really do like how it feels on the under
eyes like that I like that part so yeah
that was the hydrate concealer and then
the last item they sent me is my
favorite out of these which i thought
was confusing because i love concealers
and i'm not a big primer person but i
actually really like the primer not
enough that i would put it in my
favorite categories but i'm reaching for
it more and more and i really like it
it's the anti-aging space primer and has
more of like the silicone type of feel
so if you don't like the silicone
primers and you are not going to like
this one but i really do like it and it
says its aging hello we are in my
birthday month i am almost 30 so anti
aging a real big fan of but i just i
like the way it feels it's almost like
it can just smooth everything out which
I appreciate a lot and I've just been
finding myself reaching for it a lot
which is funny to me because a lot of
times I forget to wear primers like I
just simply forget to put them on and
I'm like oh no I need to grab my primer
and this is what I'm reaching for so if
you're looking to try out something from
amazing cosmetics I would definitely
recommend the anti-aging face primer so
that was everything for the fine
category I'm going to pop over into the
sales and then we'll finish off with the
favorite I only have one day all this
month which is excellent and I'm really
bummed about it cuz it was send to me
but you know I have to be honest but
this is also from the pixi beauty collab
it's another one in collaboration with
its duty time and it is the lip palette
like i said i'll leave my unboxing video
below that i did was the collab and I
just was so underwhelmed by the lip
palette and I even said in there that
I've never purchased a lip palette for
myself because I don't think that
they're super necessary unless you're
like a makeup artist I don't really get
lip palettes for just like the everyday
girl because if you're wearing them
lipstick from the palette and you're
going out you put the whole pellet in
your purse like I don't quite get it but
I was like hey you
even though I would never purchase a lip
palette myself like no I've been someone
had to try it out maybe I'll love it
maybe I'll maybe I'll get it but these
shades are like not there like they do
not watch well at all they don't show up
actually trying to put them on my lips
was kind of a disaster these last three
be show up really well but all the other
shades were just very very underwhelming
it made me wish that they haven't
swatched in the left eyelid because and
I was hoping that I could give it away
but I was like maybe I love it you know
maybe this little be the thing that
changes my mind about lip palace but to
me it just it didn't help it didn't help
it also unfortunately this was a fail
for me I know that I'll never I know it
will never use it which is such a bummer
but you know I'm so appreciative to the
pr packages that it gets sent but it
that's not going to sway my opinions on
anything I'll always be honest with you
guys and you know give you my trophy
back in unfortunately the lip palette
just did not work out for me alright
let's finish off with my favorite I have
lots of skin care to talk about and I
know from too cool for school that I
just loved would absolutely recommend is
there egg cream max these masks I feel
like are so interesting because there is
the only mask sheet mask that I've ever
used or when you put it on your face
it's like it lacks to your face it is
the most bizarre feeling but like sheet
mask can flip around and slide around
sometimes you feel like you can't even
sit up because they're going to slide
off your face this one as you're putting
it on it like and it is on your face and
it is not moving I think it's so cool I
was really really happy with dc's were
also sent to me from too cool for school
and I love them there are six dollars
which i think is a little bit more on
the pricey side for sheet masks but I
would repurchase them because I just I
really like these I like fell in love
with these this is from dermalogica this
is their daily super Foley and this was
sent to me I did a campaign with pre and
acne which is like similar to
influenster where you get items and you
review them and you have other tasks to
complete and I was really excited to be
a part of that campaign because I had
never tried dermalogica before we were
mostly focused on
product right here because it is new to
dermalogica and I fell in love with it
it is super cool it's you know for
anti-aging but it's also really focused
on like the pollution in the air how it
can affect the skin and then how to
reverse the damage that it does on your
skin is actually a powder exfoliant so
when you pour it out it actually comes
out as a powder and then you mix it with
water and it activates ingredients and
it kind of just looks like you have
almost like a charcoal mask kind of on
your face man it says that you can use
this everyday but because I've sent to
the skin I use it about every other day
and I like get excited when I know it's
time to use it again I really do so
that's like how I know that I really
love this product it was like I get
excited to use it I think it's really
cool I would definitely recommend this I
was really excited to get this from
Scandinavia because I have their other
sprays their makeup primer sprained
their makeup finishing spray and I think
they're great they just came out with a
new spray that super innovative I think
this is the post makeup recovery spray
so it's to gently clear pores and help
prevent breakouts and you use
immediately after removing makeup I
haven't really been liking this and at
first I was like okay you know i like
their other sprays i'm definitely going
into this open minded but we'll see I
feel like you can see a difference after
you sprayed on your skin like I feel
like I feel like you can just see
something you know I don't know how to
describe it in like the scientific terms
but I think you can see and like feel
something happening with your skin so I
incense almost every single night I feel
like it's hydrating it's a myth it's
convenient it's easy to use I can travel
with it I mean I really like this I
wanted to mention it because I reach for
it almost every single night and so that
definitely to me means the favors to me
so I don't know if you haven't tried out
any of this can maybe a sprays I suggest
you do I really love them the primer
spray especially but now this one is
another favorite and then I don't know
if this is really skin care but this is
the pure hydrogel list and this is for
your under eyes as well I can kind of
struggle with dry under eyes especially
because I do bake quite a bit which
doesn't help so like under eye patches
or the hydrogel list like really help me
out just quick and easy and convenient
and you just
slide on your under-eyes is cooling it's
hydrating it's moisturizing I love it
you can use it on your eyelids as well I
just think this is really good I use it
almost every single time like before I'm
doing my makeup but this is what I go in
with first and I think it's fantastic
new a space palettes that I got so this
is from the pixie collab I feel like
I've had a favorite huh fail and a fine
all from the pixie collab but this is
one of the contour bronze highlight
palace and this was in collaboration
with Miriam NYC so in particular i love
this highlight shade I love it I love it
and it's gold and a lot of people tell
me that I can't wear gold highlights
because it doesn't go with like my
lighter skin tone and no I don't agree
with that because I freaking love that
gold shade so much I also really like
this for a bronzer shade I've been using
that one quite a bit the other two
highlights I think are okay I don't use
the shimmer bronzer as much and then
this one's a little bit dark for me but
all the highlights I love but then
especially just between this highlight
shade in this bronzer shade I love this
palette I reach for it so much brush
that I have i got from oxalate which is
a website for influencers and we can
apply to get products from companies in
exchange for our reviews so i really
wanted to try this brush this is the
Caitlyn oh wow brush I just thought it
looked really intriguing and I was like
what is like I'm try this so I kind of
went back and forth on if I should
include it because this brush i believe
on its own is like thirty four dollars
which is so expensive I know I know it
is but I love it and I keep reaching for
it like this is the brush that I want to
apply my foundation which I think it is
so good i like it because it's small and
it like can get into all of these areas
and like it kind of like goes up to this
point it tip right here and I feel like
that's even really easier to get it you
can go you can do anything with this
brush I don't know what it is but I just
love it and I know it's more expensive
and so I just I really do apologize for
that but I really want
tell you're going to find it because
I've just been loving on it so much
something like super super dense and it
just really gets in there and I don't
know because it's smaller I was like
well is going to take me longer like do
my foundation or whatever but it doesn't
it's just such a good little brush I
thought it was so cool i've never heard
of kayln makeup before that and I was
like okay they have a ton like they're a
huge line they have a ton of brushes I
don't know the oval brush like I just
this one did something to me this one
took me by surprise and i love it and i
also have a makeup tool to talk to you
guys about it i just used it so it's
very very dirty but sigma beauty just
came out with new blenders and I was
super pumped about it Sigma did send me
them and they also sent me a pink one
and then my dog ate it so that was
depressing but they came out with pink
one and black one they're super cool
because they have all these like edges
and different angles to it and you can
really do your entire face this makeup
without feeling like you're using a
dirty sponge we're super cool very
innovative I mean you can apply your
foundation and you can do your concealer
you can bake with it obviously you can
turn it on its side and do your contour
like I just think this was really cool
i've applied highlight with this thing
you can do your nose contour I love
these and these are only fifteen dollars
so this is like I feel like these are
totally worth it and also I'm really
excited to tell you guys with that sigma
beauty actually gave me a discount code
for you guys which is like so crazy cool
if you didn't watch i did a full video
on my entire sigma beauty collection
talking about how much i love sigma and
how long I've been purchasing from them
and they're one of my favorite brands
have that video link down below but then
also sigma reach out to me a couple
weeks ago and that they wanted to give
me my own discount code for my
subscriber so if you ever make a
purchase from sigma and you want to save
a little bit of money my code Samantha
will save you ten percent it is an
affiliate code so i wanted to let you
guys know that but i just thought that
was super cool i'm not so excited about
it but definitely the 3d blenders are so
freaking cool i would totally recommend
these i've been using my nose every
single day and now i'm only down to one
so I me
to replace them I need to give you a few
other one husband keep these far far
away from my dog but the Sigma 3d HD
blenders they're good ones lipstick
shade oh I got it in an influencer box
I'll leave influencer link down below
but I got in the bite beauty box which I
was so excited about because I've never
tried by beauty they sent us these
little lipsticks may also send us some
lip liners but this shade honeycomb is
like the most beautiful nude ever I
think I've worn it in like two to three
videos and usually I'm trying to switch
up my lip colors but if there's a day
where I'm like I don't know what
lipstick to wear I'm going to wear
honeycomb because I love this new it's
so pretty it's creamy it's comfortable
on the lips is super long-lasting the
lip pencil honestly are really good too
like I could have put the lip pencil in
like the fine category I don't worry lip
pencils with time so it's not like going
to be a favorite of mine but I thought
the lip pencil is really good too but
the shade honeycomb so good this is a
part of their amuse-bouche line big
thumbs up from me last items your
cosmetics came out with lashes I think
this is the first time they were
releasing lashes and holy crap I'm
obsessed with them if you guys follow me
on instagram you know I tank in my
photos what I'm wearing and for the past
what two three weeks all I've been
wearing is secure flashes I cannot get
away from them my favorites right now
are in Siva and then also in bombshell
they're beautiful and they're so easy to
put on and the bands are so like
lightweight and sin that you don't need
liner that's why I haven't been wearing
liner as much because you don't need
them with these lashes these are 3d silk
and cruelty-free lashes and I just think
they're beautiful the packaging is
beautiful delicious are beautiful I love
everything about these lashes these are
fourteen dollars i think they're only
available on the pier website but
seriously if you love lashes like me i
highly recommend picking these up i
believe there is six different styles
total i've only tried diva and bombshell
so far but I don't feel like I need to
open another pair yet until I feel like
I've done obsessing over these two
because I love them argue that's going
to be everything for my first March
makeup monthly I really helped
guys like this video let me know what
you think of the idea of doing the
monthly series of showing you everything
that I loved they didn't love so much
and that I thought were okay products
let me know if you like the idea in the
comments down below or if you'd rather
see a more traditional favorites video
these videos will probably be a little
bit longer because I'm talking about a
whole new category as makeup but I know
I normally do longer videos anyway so I
don't know you guys let me know what you
think but I thought it would be a cool
way to be able to talk to you guys about
more makeup and you know not just having
to fit everything into a favorite or a
fill category so let me know what you
think down below in the comments but
thank you guys so much for watching I'm
super excited we're in a new month to
see what my thirties have in store for
me because I have no idea what that's
going to be I don't have a clue I hope
that you guys love this video and found
it helpful please do give it a thumbs up
if you did make sure to subscribe before
you go and I'll catch you guys real soon
in my next one nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
