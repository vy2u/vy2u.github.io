today's video is going to be a new March
musings at video so I have a couple
March music videos in this little series
that I'm doing that was inspired from
other channels such as our my beauty and
Nikki Murphy I'll have both our channels
elicit down below but just talking over
some topics that can arise in the beauty
community or the beauty industry I'll
link my other videos down below as well
in today's video I'm still I'm not
exactly hundred percent sure we're going
to be calling it but basically I kind of
wanted to talk about brands and just
some some questions that pop into my
mind when I think about brands in the
beauty industry and also the
relationship between brands and beauty
influencers or beauty bloggers are
really just like at the land of YouTube
it'll make more sense as I start to get
into it but that's kind of where the
focus of today's video is going to be so
I can tend to get chatty in these videos
so why don't I just go ahead and get
started
alrighty so what I'm talking about is
there are so many times where I have
honestly wondered do brands watch
YouTube and I feel like that might be a
really weird question but it's something
that I've truly thought about before
like do brings up anyone working with
them on staff that watch youtube videos
that listen to what beauty bloggers and
others in the beauty community are
saying and when I first think that I'm
like no that's so stupid like no they
don't have someone watching youtube
videos that's ridiculous and then I'm
like that's really not that ridiculous
actually I mean a lot of companies have
an entire social media department they
have people who run their their Twitter
accounts and their Instagram accounts
who post for them who comment back on
them you know you know things like that
who are watching for the hashtags and
dimensions to come in a lot of different
companies from the beauty industry and
beyond that have that in place so I'm
like no that's that's not that
outlandish outlandish of a question
right Samantha but sometimes I really do
wonder because I feel like there i watch
a lot of different videos i watch a lot
of different style of channels a lot of
different like you know makeup vibes
across other people i watch people
similar to
I stopped I watched people completely
different from myself and I listened to
what everyone is saying and especially
when it comes to new makeup launches
there's just so many times where I sit
and wonder like do brands bother to
watch these videos and listen to them
because they are getting in my opinion
they're getting really good feedback
from their consumers but I feel like in
my opinion I feel like it's not being
heard I feel like brands are not taking
beauty bloggers seriously sometimes and
I feel like it's kind of strange and I
don't want to say like my problem when I
was thinking about making this video I
was like I don't want to make it seem
like what anybody on YouTube says goes a
brand should take that and absolutely
run with it because no that wouldn't
make any sense and especially because
everybody has a different opinion on
things everybody thinks you know
something different should be released
but a lot of times there's a fairly
general consensus you know a particular
mood that the beauty community can be in
and not just for the beauty bloggers who
are making the videos but if you read
the comment sections a lot of people who
you know are not a bloggers who don't
have a YouTube channel but they enjoy
watching the videos and they are a
makeup consumer they are leaving really
insightful comments of you know I wish
we would see this in the in the beauty
industry I wish something like this
would be released and I think one of the
things that really got me thinking
because I've had this question in my
mind for a while I've been doing my will
i buy it series for well over a year now
I can't think of exactly when I started
it but it's been well over a year where
every single week I talk about new
makeup launches a lot of other channels
do videos similar to this as well a lot
of people do them on a weekly basis as
well where we're sitting down and we
talk you know pretty in-depth about new
releases and how they make us feel and
you know what we think about them and
all of that and I just feel like those
could be very helpful such as so many
different companies out there but I
think what really got me like you should
make that video because that's a good
question is when Tarte
came out what's there I think it was
called the icy bench palette their
little April Fool's Day thing that Tarte
did where they showed that they're
releasing this palette if I can find the
photo I'll insert it on the screen and
then it came out that
an April Fool's joke and people who are
like I'm yeah I'm sorry what because in
so many videos you hear people say this
is the palette that we would love to see
how many videos about new makeup
launches do you hear people say we're
getting the same thing we're getting the
same colors for getting the same palette
it's the same it's the same it's the
same and so many people myself and
others included are saying I would love
to see a palette like this I would love
to see a palette with this color I would
love to see a palette with this theme
and then Tarte puts out something like
that and people are like you haven't art
a round of applause they're so excited
they're like okay Tiger come on yes
bring out that palette and at arts like
no we're just kidding
april fools I felt honestly as as being
a part of the beauty community I
honestly felt like that was kind of a
slap in the face because it's like
that's what people are saying they want
this is the palette we want and then you
say it's an April Fool's joke I just
wanted to be like tart you are so out of
touch with what is happening right now
and I honestly feel like a lot of other
brands kind of fall into that I haven't
talked about this one yet I don't
believe in a will i buy it video but
lorac is coming out with their mega Pro
floor and people are like what are you
doing we already have that palette we
have that palette and then the soft glam
release like we have this palette what
are you guys doing and it's just so
fascinating to me and I try to remember
with something like lorac that that
palette wasn't just you know conceived
last week like this is probably in been
in the works for a while you know I'm
not behind the scenes and a makeup brand
or in the lab or anything like that but
typically it takes a long time to be
able to launch a makeup product and I
understand that but the same time I'm
like I just truly wonder if if brands
are just too out of touch with what
consumers are wanting and why they don't
take advantage of something like social
media such as YouTube to get the
feedback on it what's what's
mind-boggling to me is that there are so
many fantastic youtubers that are so
artistic and have such a wonderful
design mind that they do videos where
they are read
dining palette and they are gorgeous
palettes I mean I'm thinking about like
LS and Georgia Harris I've seen Angelica
I do this I think your Angelica did
something with this Tarte palette as
well like she kind of made her own
palette I mean there are so many
channels out there that do that and I'm
like how come a brand hasn't snapped
these people up and been like Abe would
you like to come on our design team can
we hire you because they are so good at
doing these different things I just
honestly I'm just I don't know I just
get a little bit befuddled sometimes and
I don't want to make this video too long
or too rambley because really that's
like the main thing that I'm trying to
say here but it just truly makes me
wonder and I just would like to know
anybody's feedback of what you think of
why brands don't seem to be utilizing
what they could when it comes to the
beauty community when it comes to the
industry when it comes with what
consumers want because to me it's really
easy to watch a video and to see what
that person is saying to look at the
comment section and be like right now
this is the trend that we're over this
is the trend that we want but very
rarely brands are giving that to us we
only have a couple of brands that are
giving it to us and I just think why is
that why would that be you know maybe
it's the timing thing maybe it's because
you know obviously products take a long
time to go from a design idea to you
know an actual concept to the actual
product to the lab I mean it definitely
could be that but I don't know I just
kind of wonder I just feel like if I had
my own makeup brand which I have zero
plans to do that but I feel like this is
such a good space to see what people who
are going to buy the makeup products to
see what they want and again don't get
me wrong I don't think brands should go
off of what one person says and runs
with that and you know whatnot but it I
don't know it just is something that
I've been curious about and I would like
to get your guys's feedback but I think
once the tart April Fool's thing came
out people were just very confused I
also thought it was a very strange April
Fool's joke to say you're coming out
with a palette like I saw a hood of
beauty came out with on April Fool's Day
that she was going to be releasing sand
and like she had a promo of like her
rolling around in the same
and it was like sand by huda beauty
coming April 1st and people are like oh
my gosh you really expect me to buy sand
and then other people are like it's
coming out on April Fool's Day obviously
it's a joke
like that's a joke you're releasing sand
a makeup company releasing an eyeshadow
palette I'm not really sure what the
joke was supposed to be there but
especially when it was a palette that
got so many people excited and honestly
I thought once it came out and people
are like tart that wasn't a funny joke
what are you doing we actually want this
eyeshadow palette I thought boom that
palettes gonna be out as I'm right now
we still don't have the palette it's the
end of April like again I'm sure it
would actually take time but if you're
gonna put something out there like that
I mean I would be shocked that you
couldn't mean you couldn't somehow
distribute that or get it ready to go
soon but that's kind of like my main
point of this video it's just kind of
that and just thinking about things when
it comes to brands and and YouTube and
the industry and all of that and then
one other thing that I feel like maybe
kind of went along with this video is
when it comes to actual like beauty
bloggers and their relationships with
brands as well because I feel like one
thing that I see and I see a lot of is
people being very vocal about being
frustrated that you only see the same
bloggers on you know something like
brand trips or even just like launch
parties or things like that or even
something such as like getting a PR
people are complaining that you know
it's the same bloggers it's the same
huge bloggers it's the same bloggers
that a lot of people say are kind of out
of touch with you know the people who
follow them now now that they've you
know got their success and the fame and
the money and all of that I mean how
often do you hear people say you know I
just can't follow so-and-so anymore
because you know she's just on a
different level I can't relate to it
anymore and things like that and I feel
like I see those comments a lot and
again this isn't a topic that I wanted
to like talk too much about cuz it's
kind of weird for me since I am a
blogger at the same time and I don't
want it to come off as like I need this
I want that in because that's not what
I'm trying to do but you see those
comments a lot I see those comments a
lot I'm sure you see those comments a
lot when the peer Cosmetics invited raw
Beauty Chrissy and her husband on a
recent PR trip that they did I got
excited
about that robbery Kristy I mean she now
has I think it's I'm sure it's over
300,000 subscribers she kind of shot up
very quickly but still 300,000 is still
kind of a smaller number compared to the
1 million the 2 million the 5 million
the 8 million that you see some other
bloggers have there consistently going
on these brand trips and having these
amazing opportunities so when you saw
when I saw Rob UT Krissy going with
Pierre I was so excited and I was like
way to go up here piers been one of my
favorite brands since back in my college
days I talked about Pierre a lot on my
channel and I have to say I was like way
to go Pierre I'm so excited to see
someone new on your branch hood to see
someone who is you know kind of like an
up-and-coming youtuber I thought that
was really freaking cool and I would
love to see more brands do that and I
kind of would like to know like your
thought as well because again this is
something that I feel like we see a lot
I haven't see it in the Instagram
comments the same people going on the
branch of the same people going on the
branch and we're getting the same vlogs
or getting the same you know speeches
and all of these different videos and
again this is around like it's kind of
uncomfortable to talk about this since I
am a blogger but I see those comments
and I understand what people are saying
because again I just go back to seeing
Chrissy on that peer trip and just
thinking like nice way to go peer I wish
more brands for like you because clearly
even if people are a smaller influencer
a smaller blogger I think that we still
have a lot of influence I see a lot of
people saying in my comments like you
know oh I bought this because of you I
bought this because you love it you know
and even with my friends I read through
their comments you know what you love
this palette so much I bought it because
of you I bought the skin care item
because of you and I think just because
we don't have in the 1 million even
things like that I do still believe that
smaller bloggers have a lot of influence
and also at the same time I genuinely do
believe that we are fairly relatable and
I think that's why a lot of people are
going to these kind of micro bloggers or
smaller bloggers because I'm just an
author sitting in my home office and
Iowa with my dog next to me on my lap
you know I'm I don't have a studio I
don't have someone behind the camera I
don't have someone doing my editing for
me and not that any of that is bad or
wrong or something that I don't aspire
to have one day
regular girl who likes to talk about
makeup and I see a lot of other channels
my size smaller than me bigger than me
that a lot of people relate to our
content into our videos and I truly
believe if more brands would be giving
micro bloggers as a chance and smaller
bloggers a chance I think other people
would be pretty excited about that and
be excited to see some fresh faces and
even when it comes to just giving a PR
box
I thought covergirl was freaking amazing
I mean covergirl is a very big brand -
yes they are a drugstore brand but they
are a brand that is very established
that it's been around for a very long
time and they recently sent out huge PR
boxes me it definitely seemed like they
were sending them to kind of the micro
influencers and I thought that was
really cool because how many covergirl
videos have you now seen when I did a
top 5 bottom 5 recently I think I had
three covergirl products in there
because now I have all these cover Belle
products to try and I'm gonna put that
in my videos and I'm going to be
reviewing them and same as so many other
people that you know it doesn't matter
that we don't have 1 million subscribers
we're still talking about products and
we're probably still gonna sell a
product or two on behalf of that brand
because they sent us so many products to
be able to review and recommend on our
channel so I thought that was really
cool and covergirl did that I was one
that received the box and was incredibly
overwhelmed I saw a lot of my friends
getting the box and I thought that was
amazing
Urban Decay is another brand that I feel
like it's focusing on micro influencers
so again myself and a lot of my friends
here on YouTube that are around you know
the same channel number and all of that
as me we received the backtalk palette
um you know we received the lip glosses
and things like that and I think that's
really cool so that's kind of just what
I wanted to talk about today I didn't
want to make this too long or Terrain
believe a video even though I'm sure it
probably still is but those are just
kind of like my thoughts when it comes
to beauty brands and then beauty
bloggers the beauty community the beauty
industry I just had a couple of things
that I wanted to throw out there because
in these March musings videos I really
like to get your feedback though I would
love to know some of your thoughts on
either one of those topics down below I
would just enjoy having these kind of
discussions in these March musings video
so if you have any thoughts or feedback
or you know maybe you think completely
differently than me you know
as you you are nice about it I
definitely do not mind having a
discussion with someone who has a
different thought process than me
because I feel like I always come out of
my March musings videos having like a
broader understanding of certain topics
that I'm talking about as well so I
appreciate any feedback that you would
want to leave down below but other than
that that's gonna do it for today's
video if you guys didn't enjoy it and
you enjoyed the March musings videos I
hope that you'll give this one a thumbs
up I hope that you'll also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys in tomorrow's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
