video is going to be a new march of
musings of video I posted my first one
of these a couple weeks back taking
inspiration from channels such as Lauren
my beauty and a Nikki Murphy I'll have
their channels elicit down below but
they do these videos lawrence is called
to talk and he's is called chat spat
just kind of having a discussion about
certain things in the beauty community
when I post in my first March musings
video I was talking about what the
challenges that smaller creators can
come across that maybe bigger youtubers
don't have when they were first starting
out in YouTube so I'll have my first
video listed down below but I really
wanted to do another one of these and
this one was inspired by not yesterday's
but last week's will I buy a video when
I was discussing Totti Westbrook and her
halo beauty and her supplements that she
just came out with and I was saying in
that video that I was almost kind of
dreading posting that while I buy a
video because I was getting so much
feedback and so many messages
surrounding Tati and her vitamins and
requesting I put it in a video and I
felt a certain way about a lot of the
messages that were coming in that had me
not looking forward to filming out that
well I buy a video and my will invite
videos I've been doing for over a year
now I post them every single week they
are my favorite videos to create and I
was absolutely drying posting that one
and a lot of it is because of all of
this drama that we have in the beauty
community and this is not a new topic
I'm not saying anything new or
earth-shattering here other people have
made videos on it as well but it's
something that gets very disheartening
at times Isis marshmallow things kind of
on like the drama and how I handle it I
wanted to kind of talk about how it
seems like negativity is almost kind of
thrived upon in the beauty community I
really like these videos for the
discussions that happen like when I
would watch channels like Lauren and
Nikki I would always leave a comment on
those videos and I enjoyed reading the
comments and seeing other people's
discussions in there so if you guys have
thoughts on these topics that I'm
talking about I hope that you will leave
some comments down below I always do
remind people to keep it kind down there
yeah without further ado why don't we go
ahead and jump in see this new map March
musings okay so like I said I want to
focus kind of on the drama and
negativity and like I said I this is not
a new subject this is not a new thing
this is not a recent thing and the
beauty community but it's it gets kind
of disheartening at times to see how
like I said sometimes it feels like the
beauty community survives on drama and
it can get super disheartening when I
saw that tattoo was releasing
supplements honestly it kind of went in
one ear and out the other when I saw
that she was releasing something that
wasn't necessarily makeup I just kind of
was like that
never mind like I don't I didn't even
think to touch on it in a will i buy it
video because normally my will about
videos I'm talking about makeup I very
rarely even touch on skin Karen in will
i buy it videos I'm typically talking
about makeup and because it was
supplements and like I said I'm not
someone who takes supplements or
vitamins I really just didn't even think
that I would talk about it but the
messages started coming in and I don't
want to say that all messages that came
in we're leaning towards the negative
side because that most certainly is not
true a lot of people seem to be
genuinely curious of what I thought but
then I was also getting in comments I
got this one comment I think this is the
one that stuck out to me the most and
that just kind of I just stared at it
for the longest time it was an Instagram
DM and it said I can't wait to see you
drag tacky and that one just stuck with
me because I was like when how I am I
I genuinely don't feel like in any of my
videos will i buy it videos even when I
did anti haul videos I don't feel like
I'm someone who drags as someone because
that's just I don't know that's just
it's not my personal style it's not in
my my tastes to do yes there are certain
brands or people that I don't enjoy but
I'm not someone who who enjoys like
publicly bashing or dragging people so I
was so disheartened when I saw that
message I was like oh my gosh there was
other messages that came in that were
kind of on the same playing field as
that like people seemed excited for me
to just bring down Tati
people seem to excite it for me to get
all heated in my video
and again I just wanted to stress the
point that not everybody was that way
not every message was that way but it
seemed like the messages for people were
angry and they wanted me to be angry
those messages had so much passion
behind them and it just kind of made me
really sad and I said that in my will i
buy up video and i said it was a reason
why I wasn't really wanting to make that
will I buy a video and I said I'm
probably gonna disappoint people that
I'm not angry or I thought I'm not
cursing and swearing and dragging
someone in my videos but I don't know
that's just not my style and even though
I don't watch Tati like I said I don't
dislike her and I like I said I don't
think she's like running a scam or
anything crazy like that but at the same
time I try to remember that she's a
person like we all are and it's it's
really disheartening when you do see
videos especially when people are
essentially dragging someone else
there's a difference between saying you
don't connect with someone you don't buy
with someone or and you're not gonna
purchase something that they have to
deal with for this reason or that reason
and then there's a difference of like
full-on just go into town on someone so
I was I was kind of bummed out when I
got those messages so I went into my
will I buy a video kind of struggling
cuz I was like man I feel like I'm I'm
really gonna disappoint people that I'm
not angry err and I think a big reason
why I wasn't angry is because I just
didn't care about supplements it's not
something I cared about it didn't I
don't know I didn't feel any emotion and
I felt like so many other people felt
emotion and really wanted to to see me
react a certain way while saying that
though I do want to say that the
comments in my will I buy a video were I
think I only deleted like three comments
maybe even just to the comments on that
on that video was so positive and there
was actually good discussions happening
about how team these vitamins and I
guess from what I had seen and kind of
the vibe that I was feeling I was really
really worried but I was so happy to see
that and even if people agreed or
disagreed there was actual conversation
and not just hateful messages back and
forth to one another and I thought that
was really really cool to see so it was
interesting how nervous I was going into
that video and how it ended up
I was really happy to see that I I don't
know I feel like this drama and the
negativity I feel like it's been around
the beauty community since before I
became a part of the community and I
really hope that there's like a new
direction I see so many other
influencers talking about it and
bloggers talking about it and we talked
about you know the positivity and trying
to eliminate that nastiness and the
bashing and the you know publicly
shaming of people and I genuinely hope
that there's a timer we do start to move
in that direction because I think that
would be fantastic but that would lie by
a video and the comments that came in
like honestly gave me hope for that I
thought that was really cool and but it
was sad too at the same time that it
wasn't what I expected to see like I
expected there to be more anger I
expected there to be fighting and it's
like man why would you expect that like
you need to get out of that head frame
because that was kind of a bummer when
you get surprised when things aren't
erotic you get surprised when there
isn't negativity like that's kind of a
bummer right so I don't know I just
wanted to touch on that for a little bit
because that's kind of what spurred this
idea was me feeling a certain way going
into that will i buy it feeling so
nervous about the comments and just
talking about something that hasn't made
such a huge splash in the beauty
community and it seems like so many
people are making videos just and
dedicated videos talking about patottie
in these supplements and I've been
watching so many people's videos and
just you know seeing what they're
thinking and seeing their feedback and
other subjects that I want to talk on
with this because when it comes to like
kind of like the negativity another
thing that I kind of feel like in the
beauty community is videos that are more
like negative seem to do really well on
YouTube which sometimes is really
disheartening and so I have a regret
series I talked about like makeup I
regret but I don't regret buying I
regret not buying
I don't regret not buy and I'll say that
for me right now where I'm at usually if
one of my videos hits 10,000 views
that's a lot for me typically my will i
buy videos will hit 10,000 views and
everyone's from all do a video that gets
a good response and gets close to the
10,000 but once i see 10,000 like that's
a pretty decent number for me personally
i posted a video of
two weeks ago and it was makeup that I
regret buying so I was talking about
products that disappoint me didn't work
out for me etc and it took off right
away it has over 13,000 views at the
moment in the my regret series the video
that I posted before products I regret
buying was makeup that I don't regret
buying so makeup that worked out for me
makeup that I didn't mind spending a
higher price tag on because it worked
out for me it doesn't even have a nine
thousand views okay
so then before that I talked about
disappointing makeup products to me it
was the my seven disappointing makeup
products in 2017 that has over 11
thousand views then I did a makeup that
I regret buying once again that has over
12,000 views and then for the last one
that I touched on just to get an idea of
these types of videos makeup I don't
regret buying and that has just over six
thousand views so it's just interesting
to me when I'm talking about makeup that
didn't work for me just pointing makeup
I regret buy and you know things like
that those videos typically get higher
views and it's just kind of
disappointing because then you see the
videos when I'm talking about makeup
that I actually like and makeup that
actually works for me and it has some of
them you know almost half the views as
their counterparts and I've just
realized like back when I used to do
anti hauls my anti hauls would get so
many more abuse than my will I buy up
video and the Willa buyeth were a
spinoff from the anti hauls because I
realized I didn't really like posting
anti hauls because it felt it felt too
negative for me personally like I felt
like every time I was doing an anti
holla I had to get like a certain
mindset and you know no I don't want to
buy that product no I don't want to
support that brand no I don't want to do
this and it was more just like negative
negative negative and that's why I did
the spin-off of the will I buy it
because it was more just chatting and
talking my way through it and letting
people see the thought process of a
normal girl sitting in Iowa buying
makeup what am I going to spend my money
on what has my attention it just felt
better to me and then doing an anti haul
and I haven't done it anti ha I mean if
I'm gonna say it's probably been close
to a year cuz it just felt it just felt
a little too negative to me and then
sometimes you could see that in the
comments as well many I'm not saying
everybody was negative in the comments
of course but you just kind of like feel
that vibe with them at least I felt like
I could
that's why I did the spin-off but I
don't know it's kind of a bummer when
you see more negative videos doing so
well view wise like it's like that's
what people are drawn to and that's what
they want to see and then you can take
your time and you make videos about
products I do work for you and we're
great and are your favorite products and
people are like me not really understood
in that it's like why I'm like I'm just
curious and I would love to get your
thoughts like do you think you're
someone who like you're drawn to more
videos like that about products that
don't work out for people and and anti
hauls and things like that
are you more drawn to that and why do
you think that would be I would love to
know I'd love to get some feedback in
the comments because it's just kind of
crazy when I did start to look at the
numbers and I see thirteen thousand
eleven thousand twelve thousand for
those more negative videos and then on
the don't regrets I see nine thousand
and six thousand it's like it's pretty
interesting right those are kind of the
main things that I wanted to focus on
but I thought I would share a few other
like comments that I've seen come in
that kind of play into this as well and
that I've kind of like tripped me up
like mindset wise one comment that I
feel like I've gotten a lot over the
past couple of months here is along the
lines of like me not swearing in my
videos and I feel like I mentioned it a
couple times in my will I buy a video
but it's a comment that I see a lot or I
get a lot of like the private messages
that say this and one thing that really
like the one comment that I feel like
kind of stuck out to me the most is I've
gotten this one a couple times actually
is people saying that I would seem more
relatable in my videos if I used foul
language and I'm like why because to me
that's that's not who I am do I swear in
real life sure like if I've been
drinking sometimes I will swear more if
I'm really upset I sure will
one thing about me like if I'm in
uncomfortable situations like maybe if
I'm like with a group of people I don't
really know a lot but they're like
friends lies I might swear more because
I don't know it's like an uncomfortable
thing but it's just not really Who I am
I don't really curse a lot in front of
like my mom
my in-laws in professional settings I
don't so I don't know it's just it's
just not really like I don't know I
don't really have a very foul mouth and
that's why I don't you don't really get
that a lot in my youtube video it would
be if I just started like cursing like
crazy in my videos I feel like it you
would be able to tell that it's coming
across as very forced because it's just
not me and am I saying that people
shouldn't know because you should if
that's you and that's how you are then
you should be yourself in front of the
camera and this is just me being myself
I think that's one of the like number
one things especially when having a
YouTube channel is you need to be
yourself and be comfortable in front of
the camera I can't pretend to be anybody
else and I don't want to fake a
different personality than what I
actually have so but it's kind of
disheartening when you hear that like
I'm not relatable because I don't curse
like I don't know that's a very little
thing but I just thought I would say it
in here because it's something that I
actually think about like what
especially when I started getting
comments like that like around the same
time as one another like they were like
overlapping comments I was like do I
really need to start doing that in
YouTube videos to be more relatable or
to bring people to my channel or make
them want to like stick around more
because I don't know it was just
something that was kind of weird what do
you guys think of that again I hopefully
this video will be shorter than my last
March musings but honestly I just kind
of wanted to say a few things and then
really see what you guys think in the
comments as well because it's just
something that is so curious to me me
personally it doesn't bother me when
people curse in videos I don't know it
doesn't bother me at all but I'm also
you know thirty year old woman and I
understand that's what people are like
but I definitely feel like there's a
difference between when people kind of
do it for like you can tell when people
are doing it more for like shock value
type of thing that you can just see when
someone's not comfortable where is
someone who is comfortable and that's
just like who they are their personality
that's how they speak that's how they
like like that I don't have any problems
with because it's just someone being
themselves I don't know those were just
kind of like the main things I wanted to
say and one one other thing that I'll
kind of I'll just kind of
like say what's been on my mind for this
has been for quite some time actually
but sometimes I feel like as a youtuber
who I don't feel like I'm necessary a
lot necessarily controversial in a lot
of different ways I mean I make a lot of
videos I put out a video almost every
single day if not seven days then I'm
putting out a video six days a week and
I cover more like hard-hitting topics
but I don't feel like I am controversial
on camera on YouTube or on any of my
other social media platforms and
sometimes I honestly wonder if that is
something that will work against me and
this is really a thing where I would
like to get feedback as well like I
really would because I've had this stop
before where it almost seems like there
are some youtubers and I'm sure a lot of
you guys probably know like who I have
in my head right now who I'm thinking of
that are not necessarily for but they're
kind of more over the top controversial
wise you see them embroiled in a lot of
drama and things like that but then
that's also the the youtubers that have
a lot of subscribers they get a lot of
opportunities with brands you know and
and so sometimes it makes me wonder like
should I be listening to this to the
advice in the comments that people
saying like you need to spill the tea
and you need to be swearing up a storm
in your videos and you need to do brand
bashing videos and you're like can
someone who is not that way be
successful on YouTube or are we in a
time right now where that's what people
thrive on and again this is not a new
thing for the beauty community or even
our world I mean look at the the
magazine covers that you see at the
grocery store it's all the drama who's
divorcing who and who's who has a drug
problem and like that's what people
focus on now why are their shows out
there like the not Desperate Housewives
the other housewives show the Real
Housewives shows like theirs shows like
that out there that are full of drama
and full of people fighting and it
always seem like I don't it just seems
like that is what we are drawn to these
days look at the
numbers on like the videos that are more
negative than normal child if that's
what people are drawn to so as someone
who you know I'm still a smaller
youtuber but I think that I'm fairly
like I'm fairly like chill like I just
I'm not interested in in placing myself
in a bunch of these like dramatic
situations and I'm that exact same way
in real life I don't like to be involved
in drama I don't want anything to do
with it I'm very much a homebody I'm
someone who truly believes that my life
is more positive when I'm in a positive
mindset I have not always had that
mindset for sure but the last probably
like four years of my life I tried to
make a big change and have it be a
mental change as well where I focus on
the positive but because if I focus on
the negative I could tell that it was
making me a more negative person and is
that possible in every single facet of
life no of course not
with YouTube videos and in real life of
course it's not always that way but it's
something I genuinely strive for so it
just kind of makes me wonder
it truly does like you know last week
out or two weeks ago and I posted my
first March musings video it was do
smaller youtubers really have a chance
to make it to succeed like some of these
bigger youtubers have the southern tip
like this week it's kind of like what
about the youtubers that don't want to
be involved in the drama do we have a
chance are we gonna get noticed or will
we get comments like well you're not
relatable well you don't speak your mind
you you don't tell it like it is and
things like that like these are comments
that I get from people because I'm not
like an overly because that's just not
my personality you know what I'm saying
so it just it just makes me wonder so
those are those are my final thoughts
those are my final all the topics that I
wanted to discuss for this March musings
video and I would just love to know if
you have any feedback on any of the
topics that I talked about enough to get
your thoughts in the comments down below
and I really I do want to of course say
that I'm not trying to come after
anybody who has a different personality
than me who has a different demeanor
than me that's not at all what I'm
trying to do because I have plenty of
friends here on YouTube and in my
life who are the complete opposite of me
and I love them for that because I think
that's fantastic I do just want to of
course make sure to say that cuz I'm
afraid I'm gonna get a comment like well
how could you say that about this person
and you know definitely I'm not trying
to say anybody who is different than me
is bad or you know shouldn't be that way
because that is not it at all
I kind of just wanted to touch more on
kind of like Who I am and the comments
that I've seen come in from that and how
it's affected me and how it's made me
think and how I've truly had the
thoughts of like maybe I should amp it
up but you know in all of this and being
on YouTube I don't want to lose myself I
don't want to lose Who I am don't want
to lose I just want to lose myself but I
just want to continue to be myself and
if you are a youtuber and you know maybe
you have these thoughts as well of you
know maybe I should be something
different you know maybe you're someone
who is more over the top than me and
maybe you've had those thoughts of like
maybe I should came it down a little bit
I would love to know if you've had those
thoughts as well because it's just
interesting when you get comments and
feedback it's interesting to see how it
how it plays into your thought process
when it comes to this but if you have
any thoughts on that or kind of the the
negativity the drama that can come in
the beauty community what you think
about it what you see how it makes you
feel I would just love to know but
that's gonna do it for this week's march
musings video I know I felt like I had a
lot of different sections of things that
I wanted to talk about and hopefully I
was able to get it all out okay you know
sometimes when you're talking about a
little bit like harder subjects it just
says it's harder to get all your
thoughts together and out the right way
I hope that you guys enjoyed this video
if you want to see another March musings
of course to let me know if you have any
other topics that you'd like to see me
discuss please let me know but I look
forward to hearing your feedback in the
comments but other than that that's
gonna do it for today's video if you
guys did enjoy it or you found it
helpful or entertaining in some way
please give this video a thumbs up I
hope that you will consider subscribing
before you go and I'll catch you guys in
a tomorrow's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
