today's video it's going to be a little
bit different I want to start a series
here on my channel I think I'm going to
call it March musings or something along
those lines I haven't fully decided on a
series name yet
if you got a good one let me know in the
comments but I've been chatting about
this on my snapchat for a while too and
a lot of people wrote in saint's they
would like to see this idea I was
inspired by my friends like Lauren my
beauty and also Nikki Murphy here on
YouTube Lauren my beauty does Tube talks
and I've seen Nikki do chat spats but
basically it's just a way to have a
conversation about topics in the beauty
community and beyond sometimes and I
really enjoy watching those types of
videos and I always feel compelled to
leave a really like thought out kind of
comment to giving my thoughts and I like
reading the other comments and seeing
what other people have to say and I just
really enjoy watching those videos and
so I thought like maybe I could make my
own I used to have these topics kind of
a lot when I did my live chats on a
weekly basis and so I thought maybe I
could bring them back but kind of put
them into a more organized a type of
video so I hope that you guys like this
video idea I'm if you do if you do want
to see it be a series please do of
course let me know in the comments but
for my first topic I really wanted to
talk about the big youtubers versus
small youtubers and do small youtubers
who are starting out or maybe have been
doing this for a while that still have a
smaller following do we actually have a
chance in the beauty community or has it
kind of been ruined by bigger youtubers
and as I go into it you'll see that this
is not I don't find myself to be a
dramatic person at all it's not a really
dramatic video I'm not like pointing
fingers at people and saying you did
this you did that but as a whole you'll
see when I start talking but have the
big youtubers ruin it for smaller
youtubers or up-and-coming youtubers do
we have a chance to succeed like you see
some of the bigger youtubers do will we
ever have the opportunities that these
big youtubers do I thought it would be
an interesting conversation I've been
thinking about this topic for a while
now I've talked about it a little bit on
my snapchat and other social media
platforms
as well but I thought it could make for
an intriguing video so if you would like
to see my first video in this series and
have a bit of a chat with me when we go
ahead and get started I say have the
bigger youtubers rooted for smaller
youtubers like I said I'm not pointing
fingers at anybody in particular or like
calling anybody out it's just more of
like the idea of these bigger channels
channels that some have been around for
a very long time some been around six
seven eight years some started with
YouTube
some people just started a couple years
ago but they've now surpassed the 1
million mark and so we see the the big
youtubers ones with 1 million 2 million
all the way up to 8 million followers in
the beauty community we see them and we
see the opportunities that they have
collabing with brands coming out with
their own brands their own clothing
lines that you see the brand trips and
things like that you sees the life that
they live and a lot of these people now
it looks like they're living the life of
luxury and of course there's always that
you know you kind of have to be aware
that you're seeing something through
social media you're seeing something
through a lens of what people want you
to see and of course we're not always
getting behind the scenes and the
struggles and the hardships that they
might go through just like every other
human being but from what we see it
looks pretty damn good for those big
youtubers and sometimes I sit here as a
you know I'm still gonna say that I'm a
smaller Channel I just hit 45,000
subscribers the other day which for some
reason was really exciting to me for
some reason that number really got me
choked up an emotional pressure for
whatever reason it might be definitely
when I think about you know YouTube as a
whole I feel like 45,000 subscribers
still has me as a pretty small Channel
and I was talking the other day on my
snapchat about topics like sponsored
videos and things like that so when I
was thinking about doing this video of
big youtubers versus small youtubers I
had a lot of different ideas that I
wanted to say in this video and I
actually started taking notes because I
know from doing the live chat that when
I get really passionate about something
or I feel very like a particular way
about a situation I can go off on like a
million different tangents and talk
about a million different things and get
kind of scattered so I really wanted to
take notes to try to help keep me
focused and make sure
I'm saying things that I want to be
saying in this video and then I realized
like I have so many different things
that I want to say that I thought maybe
I could break it down so first I wanted
to kind of focus this video more on like
sponsored videos you know just
sponsorships that youtubers can get so
again if you like this idea and you'd
want to see more and you'd want to see
more topics that I have on this general
topic please do let me know because I
can totally do another one but one thing
when I was thinking about this video and
it kind of took me back was and I mean
I'm flashing I'm flashing back years
here when I first started out YouTube
and if you don't know I actually started
at YouTube as more of a book based
channel because I'm a published author
I'm a book blogger and I thought YouTube
could be a good extension of my blog but
my blog was also a women's lifestyle
blog and I talked about beauty and
makeup over there and I started to
incorporate that on the channel and then
those videos started doing really well
and I decided to keep my book blog for
books and then a YouTube channel for
beauty and that's kind of how I split it
so I did have a channel for awhile
before I turned completely into beauty
but once I did and I started getting
invested in the beauty community and
finding other people and watching other
videos etc I one day I thought it would
be a really good idea to look myself up
on reddit yep and I learned my lesson
real quick and I have never done that
again put myself up on Reddit and I saw
I mean I saw all kinds of interesting
things on reddit about me some good some
not so good but one comment that really
stuck out to me is someone said I don't
like watching Samantha March because she
is heavily sponsored and doesn't
disclose it and I looked at that comment
and I looked at that comment and I
looked at that comment and I thought
what are they talking about and at that
time I had done one sponsored video on
my youtube channel and it was with a
Scandinavian with their makeup sprays
and I was so excited about that video is
my first sponsored video it's probably
something I'll always remember but I am
so pumped up in that video I probably
say at 5 times that the video was
sponsored it's in the description box
I've said it repeatedly in the video and
I'm still that way when I do a sponsored
video I probably say at least
five times throughout the video it's
sponsored I'm working with it's in
partnership thank you to this bridge for
sponsoring me like because I'm so
excited because I think sponsored videos
or something to be very proud of and I
do not want anyone to take that away
from me I think that is something to be
very proud of so I am so excited every
time I do a Spencer video and I say it
about a thousand times because I'm very
proud of myself so when I saw that
comment about being heavily sponsored
and not just closing it I was so
confused I was so confused
I had no idea what they were talking
about and it really bothered me and I
feel like it's a comment that I see a
lot is there's always backlash with
sponsored videos I see people who
comment on every single one of my videos
and then I do a sponsored video and I
see comments of I just don't watch
people sponsored videos but I'll watch
your next one oh I really like your
videos but I don't watch sponsored
videos so I'm not gonna watch this one
and I'm like why like it just is
something that baffles me I I try to
understand because I definitely view
myself as a youtuber I obviously a.m. I
put a lot of work into my YouTube
channel I upload six to seven days a
week but at the same time I am a YouTube
watcher I started out watching YouTube I
watched YouTube videos all day long I
support other youtubers so I am a
YouTube watcher at the same time so I
really do try to get both ends of the
spectrum here but it's definitely really
just hurting when you see comments like
that of I'm not gonna watch your
sponsored videos I'll watch every other
video and I'll support you but I'm not
gonna watch your swings or videos I feel
like those comments are very
disheartening like sponsored videos just
have this kind of like weird weird thing
to them something that kind of bothers
me because I feel like that was really
the first time that I was having
assumptions being made about me and it
really bothered me because for a very
long time I don't know how long I've
been doing this but for me personally I
will always have in my video description
box if the video was sponsored or if the
video is not sponsored the very last
line of this video you can always scroll
down to my description box and you will
either see this video was not sponsored
or you will see this video is sponsored
by I always have that in there I am up
front
parents and again if I'm doing a
sponsored video I'm also saying it in
the video and I think a lot of people
are like that what I'll say about
sponsored videos and just closing it it
is now the law you have to do that if
you are being paid to make a YouTube
video you have to disclose it by law if
you are putting up an Instagram post and
you're being paid for it you have to
just close that by law it has to say
that if you're doing a sponsored post on
Twitter anywhere Facebook by law you
have to disclose it and one thing that I
will say about disclosing sponsorships
is that it wasn't always that way this
was not always a law I said I am also a
book blogger I've had my book blog since
2009 it was never a thing that I had to
disclose that I even got sent the
product that was not a thing for years
one day I can remember getting an email
from Amazon and it said according now to
FTC you have to disclose if you are
being paid for a review or if you just
got the book in exchange for a review
that is now by law required for you just
to disclose that you also have to have a
notice on your blog saying some of these
items are sent to me in exchange for
review and some of the links that are
found in my blog are affiliate links
that has to be disclosed as well that is
also in my description box there's a
note in there that says some of these
links are affiliate links typically
Amazon and magic links those are my
affiliate links by law that has to be
disclosed but that was not always the
case so I can understand these youtubers
who were starting out years and years
ago same as me
having being a blogger we didn't
disclose that and we didn't say that
because it wasn't necessary it wasn't
the law it wasn't a thing
social media has not been out forever
YouTube has not been around forever
blogging has not been around forever so
as the internet grows and has social
media grows there are people out there
trying to figure out how do we have some
sort of control over this how do we say
what needs to happen here and what needs
to happen there and as really
and I feel like within the past a couple
of years that being that having
disclosures out there are a really big
thing I felt like I feel like it was not
that long ago that the Kardashians were
under really hot water because they
would have like Instagram posts and
snapchat posts that were ads they were
being paid to post those or to snap
these things but they were not
disclosing it and they got sent like
letters and stuff saying like you cannot
do that I feel like a couple
instagramers came under fire for the
exact same thing and it's because it's a
it's a newer thing it hasn't always been
that way and for me having a book and
getting a book to review it wasn't even
in my mind to be like oh this book was
sent to me by this publisher because it
wasn't a thing that didn't exist yet we
didn't have to disclose we didn't have
to say those things not because we
didn't want to where we were trying to
be Shady
it just wasn't a topic yet this wasn't
brought up yet even now to this day I
watch YouTube videos and I hear people
say something that just that doesn't
fully make sense to me like sometimes
I'll hear people say like oh I'm really
excited that such-and-such is doing this
video with me and I'm like doing the
video does that mean like you are
sponsored or maybe you just got sent
some of the products like I don't know
what that means and I go to the
description box and there's nothing it
doesn't say it's not sponsored it
doesn't say it is sponsored I'm like not
a hundred percent sure what's going on
here like you know I feel like some
people try to kind of do this weird
thing or maybe they'll say it in the
video but it's not that a description
box which again is required you have to
have your FTC in your description box so
I still see that from youtubers and as
of right now as of where we are in 2018
that should be a thing if you're on the
internet you're a blogger you're
youtuber you're Instagram or whatever it
is you are you should be fully aware of
the FTC guidelines that's just is what
it is I can I can understand a few years
ago I can understand 2010 2012 probably
I can understand that but in 2018
everybody should know that you should
know to be up front you should know to
be disclosing that there's no excuse for
it these days there's definitely not a
topic that I want to bring up because
I've seen it and I've been a part of it
personally
yes it was before I was on YouTube but
it still was the same thing it was the
same at topic of disco
so hopefully that part makes sense but I
did want to throw it out there and yes
some of these bigger youtubers they
probably got a lot of money for doing
sponsored videos before they had to be
disclosing it and maybe some of them for
a while could play off the oh I didn't
know you were supposed to just close
that I don't know I'm not saying people
did that because I have no idea but that
definitely could have been a thing but
kind of one of these like underlying
points that I'm trying to make with this
video is that these bigger youtubers now
we're probably taking on a lot of
sponsored videos and being able to make
a lot of money without disclosing it so
people didn't know it was a sponsored
video so they were just watching and
continuing to support clicking the links
buying the products using the codes etc
etc etc without knowing that it was
sponsored and so guess who's making the
money the brand and then also the
influencer is making the money but now
you have these smaller youtubers who are
trying to make something of their
channel they're trying like some people
are trying to make this a job they're
trying to make this career but then we
get a sponsored video and we say hey
this is a sponsored video and we are
slammed for it we can't be make a
sponsored videos we can't be making
money over here no we can't use
affiliate codes we can't make sponsored
videos we can't get PR we can't do any
of those things so in my mind I'm like
okay before disclosing was a thing these
beauty bloggers were probably making a
lot of money doing these sponsorships
before people are really aware of the
whole sponsoring video thing but now the
smaller youtubers are trying to do it
we're trying to make money we're trying
to be able to work with brands make
connections with free I make
relationships with brands like these
other big bloggers have but now we can't
do it because we're getting called out
even if I do a video where I just say I
like a product people are like oh yeah
cuz you're sponsored by them and it's
like no if I am I would say it sometimes
like oh I feel like I do it fairly
frequently on my Instagram I'll make a
video and I'll do a full face of one
brand full face of a skincare brand
something and I'll get comments up but
you really need to say that this is a
sponsored post but it's not if it's not
I'm not gonna say it is if it is I will
say it I will say it in every single
Instagram because that's a la your goal
don't want to get in trouble not
interested in that but just because I
make a one brand video doesn't mean that
it's sponsored
what I'm hoping for is that that one
brain will see hey this girl too soon a
full one brand of our looks I'm gonna go
ahead and repost it that's what I'm
hoping for that would be great
I love getting reposted on Instagram
that's the bomb it doesn't mean it's
sponsored though doesn't mean I'm paid
for it but we get so much flak I in my
make in my makeup monthly I talked about
a couple of random things like a
deodorant and a hair mask and every
single time I had to be like this is not
sponsored no sponsored video like we
always have to how many times do you
hear in someone's video oh I really love
this it's not sponsored we have to
continually be saying that because we
get these assumptions thrown at us a lot
this is sponsored that's sponsored you
need to say it's sponsored it's like but
it's did but it's not if it was a lot of
us can say it and again there are
youtubers out there that I genuinely do
feel still kind of hide the fact which
sucks because I feel like it ruins it
for other people but I have to believe
now in this day of age and seeing people
actually get in trouble for not
disclosing I have to believe that more
youtubers are gonna get it together and
disclose and say when they're sponsored
and things like that so I do some off
the sony a 5100 which is known to
overheat i can film for about 16 minutes
straight and then it dies so if things
kind of seem a little like choppy at
points it's probably because my camera
overheat it was just really frustrating
but i did want to talk about that with
the sponsorships with disclosing how it
hasn't always been around etc but then
one thing that i was talking about this
on my snapchat the other night and i was
saying that i kind of went through a
tough time doing sponsored videos myself
because like i mentioned it my husband
did lose his job about three weeks ago
and that was our main source of income
and our stable steady income I am
completely self-employed like I said I'm
a published author I do freelance in the
book industry and then I'm also a
youtuber so my income a month-to-month
can fluctuate very greatly so we really
relied on Mitch's job for a steady
income also really fun things like
health insurance things like that so
when that happened it obviously was very
concerning but I was
getting some offers in to do sponsored
videos and I should have looked I think
I did like for sponsored videos in
January 4 or 5 but I did quite a few
sponsor videos more than I would
normally do because typically with
sponsored videos I will only do one or
two a month because otherwise it's you
know people will get mad at you people
will say you're doing too many sponsored
videos you're a sellout you're the sewer
that like I've seen on my channel I see
it on other people's channels it's
almost like we have to apologize every
single time we make a sponsored video
I'm sorry it's another sponsored video
but tomorrow's video won't be sponsored
you know we have to say things like that
or we have to say thank you so much for
supporting the sponsored video I
appreciate it so much because not
everybody does and that's and that's sad
and I see it with almost every single
sponsored video i watch or we have to
defend ourselves I was even watching
desi Perkins the other day who has like
what two over two million subscribers
and she had to give a 10-minute spiel
about how much she loves NARS and and
honestly really does love this
foundation like we all just kind of feel
this weird pressure to have to defend
ourselves but as we're making the video
and it's something that's kind of
frustrating but because I was getting
more offers at the time that we just
lost an income I felt like I genuinely
could not say no to doing a sponsored
video and I do want to make sure that
I'm saying
still with brands that I would do
anyways and still videos that I would do
regardless and I stand true to that I
mean I I have been since I started my
YouTube channel and I feel like I can
say that confidently because what people
don't see is what youtubers do turn down
what we say no to what we negotiate you
don't get that behind the scenes that we
have so even though it might seem in
January like yeah I posted a lot of
sponsor videos I still said no even
after Mitch had lost his job I was still
saying notice wants or videos if it's a
brand I don't feel passionate about
products that I don't feel passionate
about a video that just doesn't make
sense to my channel something I don't
feel strongly about I'm still not gonna
do it no matter how much money is being
thrown at me but what I was doing before
this happened was I was trying to space
them out because I didn't want to be a
sellout you know what I'm saying and I
was turning down opportunities I was
turning
Brants I was turning that down videos I
genuinely wanted to make and do because
I was so afraid of the sponsorship
backlash and I look back on it now and I
kind of like that sucks that sucks that
I did that because you never know when a
certain brand reaches out to you and you
say no to them will they reach out to
you again or have you just lost that
opportunity you've just they moved on
they went to someone else there's
obviously a bajillion beauty bloggers
out there like did you just lose your
chance because you said no because you
already had a sponsored video booked
that month that's a bummer to me well I
did I felt that I had to come on to my
snapchat and explain even though you
know I've been pretty vocal about what's
happened but I like this is why you're
seeing you know a sponsored video almost
every single week on my channel at the
same time I'm like why should I have to
turn down videos and brands that I
genuinely want to do that I do feel
passionate about and I can understand
that posting a sponsored video every day
or every other day but for me personally
I post 30 videos a month ok that's a lot
of videos so even if I do two three four
five sponsored videos that's still not a
lot of videos a month compared to my
normal schedule I can totally understand
being frustrated if I were to do like
two videos a week and one was oh a
sponsored I can get that that vibe that
might seem a little strange and maybe
you're only making content for the
sponsorships but especially for me
personally and I just I mean obviously I
know myself but if you look at my
channel and you see how much I post I
feel like my videos and my work and my
dedication speaks for itself and that I
shouldn't have to defend myself
I genuinely feel that way and I think of
the same about a lot of other youtubers
that I see them do sponsored videos and
some some do more than others
but I see the other videos that they do
and I see the hard work that they put
into it and so it's not something that
makes me mad I try to look at sponsored
videos as kind of like a reward like a
bonus at your job we have to work for
these sponsorships we have to get our
names out there we have to be seen and
we have to do it all ourselves right we
don't have anybody helping us do it so
we work really hard to do those so
that's why I said
there I'm really proud when I do a
sponsored video I'm so proud I want to
tell everybody about it I can't even
tell you guys how excited I was to work
with Ebates because I love you Bates and
I don't talk to my friends about a lot
of my YouTube life because I know that
they don't fully understand it like you
know I'll say things here and there but
they don't really know like the ins and
outs of it obviously you probably don't
unless you're in it or you watch a lot
of YouTube or something but I was
telling them all about Ebates and
they're like oh that's that website you
told me to use for cashback go like yes
but like I was so proud of myself but I
was thinking about that when it comes to
like how much is too much and when to
say no and all of that and I feel like
going forward if there's an opportunity
presented to me or a video presented to
me I wanted to be taking it because I
feel like that's important and not only
just the money side of things money is
definitely very helpful for a just to
live my life and pay my bills but you
know we also need to have good cameras
and you know I get things all the time
about you should have a background or a
backdrop or you should have shelves
behind you and I'm like yeah what okay
sure money is great but I also think
something that's really important is
building relationships and especially
with like brands and companies I think
that part is really important as well so
I want to continue to just say no to the
videos that I wouldn't want on my
channel don't fit with my channel don't
fit with me brands or products that I
can't fully support that's what I want
to say no to and I don't want to say no
just because I've already done a
sponsored video that month hopefully
that makes sense so I was thinking along
those lines as well and about when I was
saying about like cameras backdrops etc
I've mentioned this in a past video as
well about the unrealistic expectations
I feel like youtubers have but
especially smaller youtubers because you
know we are for some reason expected to
have the best equipment and the best
setup we're expecting to have like
amazing quality videos our editing needs
to be fully there like we get compared
to the bigger bloggers who are doing
this solely full-time this is their
full-time job a lot of times you see the
youtubers husbands working with them
they're the ones editing the videos
they're the ones filming the videos I
mean I'm a one-woman setup I mean I got
area slipping on the chair next to me
but she's not a huge help no one helps
me film no one helps me edit no one
helps me market it myself I don't have a
manager I don't have a team and a lot of
these big bloggers do a lot of them have
management teams they have people out
there booking jobs for them helping them
get on these trips helping them get
these opportunities smaller youtubers
don't have that but at the same time
we're expected to put out the same
quality videos as other big bloggers it
doesn't make sense to me we're expected
to have the most pristine backgrounds I
filmed in my office
this is my office this is my space this
is my home and it is messy it is lived
in it is loved there is stuff everywhere
I don't have a beauty room I don't have
a filming studio hard to because at the
same time that we're expected to have
all this greatness and all the set up
we're also supposed to have all of the
makeup we're supposed to be reviewing
the new makeup but we also have to buy
all the new makeup you know a PR is a
totally different subject we could talk
about that another time but we can't
except PR we can't get things as gifts
we have to be buying all the makeup or
otherwise we're not honest but at the
same time we can't get paid for it we
can't just sponsored videos we shouldn't
put ads on our YouTube videos I get told
all the time I should stop putting ads
on my YouTube videos and my videos would
be nicer to watch if there wasn't an ad
in the middle of it and I'm like so how
do you think I'm supposed to have all
this equipment and all of this setup and
all of the makeup products if I can't
get paid and you know I hear people say
well I only trust people who do YouTube
as a hobby I don't know what to tell you
about that like that's one of the more
frustrating things that I feel like I
have ever heard and because I do hear a
lot of people say that that you do
YouTube as a hobby but they still do put
ads on their videos or they get paid or
they do a sponsored video or they accept
PR I mean it just it is what it is I
feel like it's almost impossible to do
something full-time as a hobby without
having some sort of something from it
like when I was a book blogger I started
that as a hobby but I started getting
books to review because I couldn't go
out and buy all of the books I couldn't
even go to the library to get all the
books because the new books weren't in
the library yet so I was trying to go
out into the bookstores and buy them and
I couldn't even just buy the books that
were $20 $30 at a time how am I expected
to buy a $50 a shadow palette and review
it when it comes out
you can't it's impossible to so when I
see comments like that it is really
frustrating but so with all that being
said I'm genuinely curious and sometimes
I sit and wonder do these smaller
channels the smaller youtubers the ones
who have just started the ones who have
started for a while but we haven't made
those big numbers yet the ones who have
yet to start do we actually have a
chance in the beauty community to make
it as a big youtuber can we turn this
into a career can we have some of the
opportunities that the big youtubers are
presented with will we ever get that
chance or has it almost kind of been
ruined by a bigger youtubers and again
not saying it's on purpose or there's
anyone in particular that I'm pointing
out I'm just saying with how the beauty
community has kind of changed since it
began to where we are now do smaller
youtubers have a chance or will we
constantly have to be defending
ourselves whether it comes to
sponsorships or it comes to PR or
anything like that well we have to feel
like we can to take certain
opportunities because we're afraid of
the backlash these are things that
bigger youtubers probably didn't have to
deal with or maybe didn't have to deal
with as much as we do now they probably
weren't under the same amount of
scrutiny when they were starting out and
when they were getting handed these
opportunities they were able to more
freely say yes so now not only have they
been making the money they've been able
to go on to create their own brands or
create their own lines if YouTube were
to end tomorrow a lot of these bigger
youtubers probably have a comfortable
enough Bank accounted to say that that's
okay or they have other opportunities
they have their own lines they have
their own brands they have you know
certain knowledge or experience in
certain areas like I heard does he perk
and say I would like to have a
production company if I wasn't in
YouTube and she's been able to learn a
lot of that through her YouTube channel
so a lot of those people would be
totally fine so these the beauty
bloggers are very well established but
then I also think about the changes to
the YouTube Partner Program I know
that's been a really hot topic of
discussion lately and you know obviously
who's that affecting that's affecting
the smaller creators when things happen
and YouTube starts pushing out popular
videos or trending videos or things like
that whose videos are they sharing the
bigger youtubers even
snapchat did their freakin update the
day that I'm filming this and it's
horrible but instead of being able to
look at the people who I decided to
follow on snapchat they're showing me
popular stories from like celebrities I
don't care i I chose who to follow on
snapchat because I want to watch them
not who you are deeming as popular so
when I think about all of this it just
it constantly kind of feels like the
smaller guys are just being pushed to
the wayside push to the wayside so
sometimes I truly do worry like is it
too late I started too late do I have a
chance to be successful do I have a
chance to be able to have some of these
opportunities like the big bloggers do
or has that time already passed and the
big are just going to keep getting
bigger and the smaller just gonna keep
getting pushed down in rhythm ziz going
to keep finding ways to making our
voices even smaller and then if we
constantly feel like we have to defend
ourselves and turn down opportunities
how can we actually be expected to grow
and have some of these amazing
opportunities life-changing
opportunities that some of these other
bigger bloggers are doing do we have a
chance sometimes I really don't know to
be honest sometimes I really don't know
and I really do wonder and worry about
it I'm just curious and I would like to
know your feedback and I wanted to give
the reasons why I kind of thought you
know dude the smaller youtubers have a
chance because these are the things that
run through my own head there's times
where I film edit and upload almost
every single day sometimes I'll take a
Saturday off from uploading a video
sometimes I'll take I try to take at
least one day off of filming a video
just to have like a reset button but I
know how hard I work I know how many
hours I put into it and I know how much
money I make from it to how many hours
and how much time and how much money I
put into my own channel and it's it's
still uneven it is still putting more
into it than what I am making and then I
see how much I have to defend myself
over assumptions and false allegations
because youtubers used to do this this
used to be a not a thing that now we get
the blame for it and we have to defend
our
I have to say no to opportunities and
sponsored videos just because I'm afraid
of the backlash of putting out too many
videos so will I have those chances will
I have those opportunities I really want
to know and I would like to get your
thoughts down below of anything that I
mentioned or if you feel strongly about
anything that I mentioned in this video
I would like to know and one thing I
know I always hear Lauren say it in her
videos as well as that she just wants to
have a good conversation I don't I
really don't want to see a lot of like
fighting in the comments and things like
that I want to have a genuine
conversation with people about these
things and not make it overly dramatic
or mean in the comments or attacking
other people you know things like that
but it's something that I think about a
lot and something that I would like to
know and I would I would like to know
your feedback and maybe I said something
today that clicked with you and maybe
you thought you know what I never
thought about it that way curious
whether you have a channel or you don't
and you just like watching YouTube I
would love to know your thoughts down
below and like I said if you guys would
want to see this on a series or if you'd
want to see the same topic like I said I
have a couple of other items that I'd
like to talk about maybe like PR brand
trips things like that I have opinions
and topics that I think that I could
bring up on both of those items as well
so if you want to see more of these
videos please do let me know and I would
love to make some more because I enjoy
having these conversations to have
conversations I'm someone who still does
read and respond to almost every single
comment of mine and I enjoy doing that
and I like hearing from other people as
well and you know these videos that I've
seen Lauren and Nikki do and other
youtubers have done them as well but
they always leave me thinking and a lot
of times they they shed light on
something that maybe I didn't know or I
learned something from their videos so I
really appreciate those kind of videos
and like I said I love learnin Nikki's
channels linked down below I enjoyed
both of these ladies very much and would
highly recommend them especially if you
do like videos that like these but
that's gonna do it for today's video and
I hope that you enjoyed it and leave me
some comments down below let's have some
nice discussions in the comments section
but if you guys have enjoyed this one I
hope that you will give it a thumbs up I
hope that you will also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
