today's video is going to be another one
in my makeup collection series so I have
done a few videos so far going over
sections of my makeup collection I will
leave everything link down below so you
can check it the other ones out but most
recently i did my eyeshadow collection
and i asked what you wanted to see next
and a lot of people said mascara so i'm
going to go through my mascara
collection which is actually pretty
small because i do a lot of false lashes
and so i'm also going to go over my
false lashes as well so i will do that
once i get through with the mascara but
i thought i could team these up because
obviously they go together well but
since my mascara collection isn't like
overwhelming by any means i thought i
could add in the eyelashes to this one
too but to go through my mascara
collection so this is the they're real
mascara this is from a benefit cosmetics
one of my favorite mascaras this is what
the wanda looks like one of my absolute
favorite mascaras i got this one in a
kit that came with like a bunch of like
deluxe sizes and this is one that I will
definitely repurchase in a full size it
is a fantastic mascara does great things
for the lengthening the eyelashes in one
of my favorites to wear on a day where
I'm not wearing false lashes so if you
can to tell I really love the Too Faced
better than sex mascara I have a deluxe
size that i got for like purchasing so
much of two-faced from Ulta I have a
full size that i purchased myself and
then I also have another little guy I
think this came in like a beauty box or
something and I've been holding onto it
because I need to use these up one of my
favorite mascaras as well I can go ahead
and open it up and show you a wand this
is like a favorite of so many people
this is what the wand looks like it
really does make your lashes look
thicker and fuller a fantastic mascara
it gets a ton of hype for a very good
reason it's amazing but I also do have
the two-faced this is the better than
sex
scary but it's a waterproof version it's
a newer version the one looks exactly
the same but unfortunately I talked
about this one in my October faves and
unfaithful which I can leave link down
below and it was an unfavorable eek
rumbles off my lashes very very quickly
and I didn't find it to be very
waterproof either so oddly enough this
was a Miss for me but the Too Faced
better than sex regular mascara is a
huge hit so this next one is a from Max
Factor it's their masterpiece max high
volume definition mascara so a max
factor is recently like trying to guess
make a comeback in the US there's what
the wand looks like and they recently
released a capsule collection it came
with the mascara and eyeliner and then
also two lipsticks and I was sent the
collection to review and test out the
eyeliner I didn't love the lipsticks I
thought were ok but the stand up product
from that collection I definitely
thought was the mascara I find myself
reaching for this quite a bit I wouldn't
put it in a favorites category because I
don't think it does anything amazing for
your eyelashes I think that it I think
it does help you know give them volume
and length but nothing crazy like I
reach for this mostly to prep my lashes
for false lashes I or a day where I just
need something super super natural I'll
reach for this it's still a really
really good mascara I'll say that it
just isn't quite in the favors category
but still really good and like I said
the standout piece from that Max Factor
collection so another deluxe eyes
mascara i have here is from blink it's
their mascara amplified this is actually
a tube mascara and i got this in i
believe it was a lash stash to go one of
the sephora favorites kids that came
with a bunch of these mini mascaras this
is what the one looks like and when I
opened it up I wasn't really like
impressed by the wand it kind of you
know didn't blow me away or anything but
this is a really good mascara if you do
like to mascara basically what it does
is it puts little tubes on your
eyelashes so it's kind of like you have
big lashes on but without the hassle the
clashes and it's kind of fun because
when you take it off you were literally
seeing like the tubes come off your
eyelashes it's really crazy and actually
that girl Shay she just recently did a
video where she tried out i believe it
was this exact mascara or it was at
least from blink who's kind of known for
their tube mascara and she went into
really great detail and she even showed
about like removing it I thought it was
a really interesting video I'll leave it
linked down below I know not everyone is
a fan of tube mascara sometimes I am
sometimes i'm not i really have to be in
the mood to wear it but it is a nice
mascara so this Lancome mascara came in
there as well i believe it was their
Hypnose drama you can see that I used it
quite a bit because this did become a
favorite of mine and actually it's
pretty much gone after I filmed this
video i think i'm going to go ahead and
throw it away because i used the crap
out of it i ended up really really
liking this mascara okay I should check
and see how much the bolsa as well as
because I would probably buy it that's
how much I liked it i also used this in
my testing weird instagram hacks and I
dipped it in baby powder I knew it was
about gone so I figure that's why I
would use this one so this needs to be
retired it is it is done it is empty but
the Lancome Hypnose drama was a really
awesome mascara really good for giving
you thicker eyelashes I think the
Smashbox x-rated came in the lash stash
as well i'm pretty sure that it did and
again this mascara is bum i love this
mascara i will definitely want be
wanting a full size of this because i
think it's fantastic you use this on
days where i'm going to have a natural
lash because i think it makes your
lashes so long it's not quite to the
point of like looking like you have the
false lashes on but it's really really
good this immediately became like a
favorite mascara of mine once I got it
and I just think it's excellent so this
is another mascara from benefit it is
there a roller lash whole man this is a
good mascara not only do i think the
packaging is like super super cute but
it is a great mascara and it's a pretty
different looking wand if you can tell i
mean when i first pulled it out and you
look at the wander like
does that actually do anything for your
lashes like are you sure but this is a
fantastic mascara i do have a birthday
one as well from auto you get it for
your birthday but I've been waiting to
use it because I want to make sure i use
this up first which I know will not be
an issue it does great things for
lengthening your lashes and then also
for giving them a curl I don't usually
curl my eyelashes it's just a step that
I never really take and this is really
nice when you do still want a little bit
of a curl I wear this very very
frequently one of my favorite mascaras
so this is another mini and this is one
that came in to lash stash and I
actually do need to get rid of this one
as well because it is empty I can no
longer use it but this is from Tarte and
it's their lights camera lashes so this
is what the wand looks like honestly so
many people rave about this mascara and
they always talk about how this is their
favorite mascara and I don't know it's
not my favorite tarp came out with
lights camera flashes as well it was in
like a gold packaging and I thought that
was a much better mascara this just
never really did anything for me so this
is a mascara that I use really only to
prep my lashes for false lashes and
that's about it I wouldn't wear this
mascara on its own I did go through the
whole tube because like I said I do wear
false lashes quite a bit so I'm
constantly prepping the lashes before I
put them on so I did end up going
through this mini guy but I'll have to
get rid of this one because it is
completely used up and I don't think
this is one that I would repurchase this
next one I actually can't talk about
because I have not opened it yet this is
the pier fully charged mascara and I
actually I really don't even want to
open it because once you open a mascara
I mean that's when it's like shelf life
starts and I've been really diligent on
am not opening this one up before I get
through some of my other ones it's
definitely a makeup product that doesn't
last the longest so instead of just
opening a ton of different mascaras and
I mean you guys saw how many mascaras i
have opened instead of just opening all
of them at the same time i try to wait
so this is the one in my collection that
i'm currently waiting to open but i'm so
excited too because I've heard such good
things about this this one I believe
came in a beauty box as well so that's
why I haven't but I haven't opened it
yet but I am
super excited to try this one out I love
pure so the last one that I want to talk
about i think is my only affordable
mascara is that right is this my only
drugstore mascara i think it that it is
so this is the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara I rape about this
mascara all the time it's one of my
favorites here's what the one looks like
it's a little bit similar to the benefit
roller lash except it's bigger and I
think this is my second lash sensational
mascara so it's one that I repurchase I
just really really love this mascara I
really do I think it is amazing like I
said it kind of reminds me of the roller
lash and that it just extends your
lashes so much I will wear this alone
this is not something that I would like
waste on just prepping lashes I
definitely wear these on days where I'm
not going to wear false lashes but I
still want really bomb looking lashes
the Maybelline lash sensational oh it is
a good one so that's my full mascara
collection and little mini reviews on
each one that was my mascara collection
and why don't we hop over into my
eyelash collection and I will show you
what that looks like okay so i just
added my eyelash collection on here so
you can see these top three that i
really do love the I lower lashes and
those in collaboration with Vegas nay
she's a very very well-known
Instagrammer these were the first ones
that i bought from the collection they
were the shining stars you can get the I
lower lashes at like Alta or Target and
this is a little bit strange but the
lashes are not in here i just opened
this up and there's no lashes in there
so where are my shining star lashes oh
dear i'm very concerned so I can't show
you the shining star lashes and now I
need to go on a mad hunt for them
because they're one of my favorite
lashes and then I also have two of the
grand glamour lashes so you can see that
this is what they look like this is my
backup pair when I get done with my
other pair I mean you can see i'll put
them close I mean these are grand lashes
these lashes are huge and fluffy
showstoppers I absolutely love them I
mean they're not something that I like I
would wear on the daily type
thing these are more like with my
going-out lashes and but there are some
of my absolute fave and they are super
comfy like they might not look like the
comfiest of lashes but they are actually
super super comfortable again just done
with my favorites and you can get the
either eyelashes at Ulta or Target grand
Glamour's it tend to be sold out a lot
that's why I actually got the shining
stars first because I could not find
these but I love them whenever I see
them at target I grab a pair because I
know that i always want them in my
collection so moving down a little bit
I'll just grab these one these are from
huda beauty and these are the Samantha
lash how do they go these are the
Samantha lash number seven so the Hooda
packaging is pretty well known these are
my first lashes that I got from her i
believe the lashes are like twenty
dollars so they're pretty expensive you
can get them at sephora now but they are
really good lashes so my Samantha lashes
they do need to be tossed I've been
wearing them for so long now and I have
a pair in my cart during the Sephora vib
sale it starts for me the day after that
I'm filming this so i have a new pair
that i plan on getting but the Samantha
lash is amazing a lot of people really
rave about the hooter lashes and I'm
glad that I'm going to get a pair had
twenty percent off cuz they are
expensive I also have some of like my
lash adhesive in here too to show you
guys so this is from duo they are pretty
well known for their eyelash adhesive
this one is in clear white it came in my
fault beautycon box I think it's okay um
it does dry pretty clear pretty clear
but i still prefer dark tone eyelash
adhesives but this is just fine another
one that i have is from house of lashes
now this is their lash adhesive talks
about the house of lashes eyeshadow glue
being just amazing and how it stays on
forever I don't know if they're glue and
the adhesive is different because my
lashes don't don't stay on all that much
longer and I don't really like the brush
I didn't really prefer that so like
people say when you put on house of
lashes with their lash glue that it
stays on like like you have to rip your
lashes off and these come right off so I
don't know the idea and the glue must be
different anybody knows let me know
but this didn't like really blow me away
so I really only use it if I know like
I'm going to film and I need to wear
lashes for 20 minutes and that's it I'll
throw this on because I don't think it's
super long-lasting so I have another one
from duo now this is a dark tone
adhesive I just bought a new box I ran
out of mine this is probably my favorite
lash adhesive to date I like I said this
is a repurchase I really like it i like
getting the dark tone because it just
blends and easier with your eye makeup
instead of having like the ugly white
adhesive peeking out I just prefer dark
tone like a hundred percent and then the
last adhesive that I have is from kiss I
just got this off amazon it's their
strip lash adhesive with a low it's also
in black which I like again dark tones
are much better I like this but this is
one that stays on like crazy it's kind
of hard to get the lashes off and that I
wear like if I know I'm going out at
like 10 a.m. and i'm going to be gone
the rest of the day and all night
because if I just wear it for a few
hours and try to get it off it doesn't
really want to come off so this is
really a really good option for like
long wearing lashes and again I'll leave
it linked down below to Amazon where I
found it so these are lashes from
flutter lashes in collaboration with
makeup Shayla these are the I slay
lashes these came in the fall beauty
combox as well and I don't know what
these I thought I heard that they were
like exclusive to the beauty come back
so I don't know if you can repurchase
these or not and it actually kind of
makes me sad if you can't because these
turned into some of my favorite lashes
when I first tried him on I was like I
don't know they're fine like they didn't
excite me too much and now I absolutely
love them I just think they are so much
fun though I'm bummed i'll have to look
to see if you really can't repurchase
them because i thought they were nice
they're not like over-the-top but
they're not super super natural so i
thought they have a nice mix in there so
again the i slay lashes these are our
dell wispies now these are like my pair
that i have ready to open up when i get
rid of some of my other ones and i will
say this isn't necessarily my entire
eyelash collection because i have five
other pair of our tell wispies that I
we're quite a bit they're just kind of
you know getting getting down there on
if I should
them away or not so I didn't feel like I
needed to show all of them and like a
lot of them you know I throw this nice
part away so they're just in these
little cases so I have at least four if
not five other pair of wispies and so
I'm just waiting to get through some of
those before I open up the next pair but
our dell is super affordable you can
find them at drugstores they're amazing
some of the best lashes especially for
beginners I just the wispies especially
I absolutely love them and then the last
pair of lashes that I have to go over r
the r del soft touch says it comes with
tapered tips I just thought it looked
really interesting i've never tried
these before a lot of times you can get
our dell like buy one get one free buy
one get one half off that sort of thing
and that's why I purchase these I just
they look like lashes that I would
really like so I've been waiting to use
up some of my other wispies before I
jump into this but again our doll lashes
you really can't go wrong especially for
the price alright guys so that is going
to be everything for my mascara and my
false eyelash collection I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video I love
that you guys seem to be enjoying my
makeup collection series like I've said
in a couple of my past videos I don't

of fancy setup I use my bookshelf as
