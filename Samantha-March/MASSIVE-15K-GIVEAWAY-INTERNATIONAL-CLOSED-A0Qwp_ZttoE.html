how to enter this will be an

like the only rule that you must be
doing because you must be subscribed to

snapchat i also do leave bonus entries
on my snapchat so if you're not
following me yet on snapchat you could
do that there will be a link in the
description box down below just make
sure to click on that link because that
is how you will actually get entered
into the giveaway do you use like a
generator so at the end of the giveaway
it randomly picks the winner so I don't
have to actually take the winner myself
so you do need to be entered via that
link and via the generator or else your

will also share in the description box
of this video the winner will be on
there as well but i will wait for them
to confirm with me via email because
i've been doing a lot of giveaways
lately and not everybody is getting back
