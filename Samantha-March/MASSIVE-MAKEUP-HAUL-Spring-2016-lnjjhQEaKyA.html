today's video is going to be probably a
pretty large makeup all I've received an
influencer box a couple of PR boxes and
then done a little just a little
shopping on my own as well but I feel
like I have quite a few products to
share with you guys so let's not waste
time on like the intros let's jump into
it a new influenster box if you guys are
not familiar with influenster i do talk
about it quite a bit on my channel
website i can leave it linked below but
basically you just are able to get
products for free in exchange for
reviewing them you don't have to be a
blogger or vlog or anything like that
it's need to be able to review I'm on
like the influencer website like CBS
target amazon those kind of places so I
love when I get a new box this one was
the bloom box and it came with a variety
of of them come with like a specific
brand I've got in the l'oreal box
l'oreal products this one is kind of
like a hodgepodge of different products
but i will go ahead and show you what I
got and they always do come with this
little card that kind of explains each
product that you've got the first thing
in here was these cute ex advanced
revival nail polish remover paths they
look like this I have not tried these
yet mostly because I typically have on
nail her nails and I don't need to
remove my nail polish on my natural
nails as one pad cleans off all 10 nails
which is really nice and they come in a
free pack and it says it is a dollar 49
it says it strengthens and nourishes
with botanical oils for natural nails so
that is what that looks like when I
don't have my nails on and I do paint my
natural nails I will definitely be
trying these out quite curious about
them the next item in here is from not
your mother's it's called plump for joy
this is what it looks like it says it's
a thickening hair lifter for fines and
hair it's supposed to volumize
strengthen and shine I did receive a
product from not your mother's in
another influencer box and I didn't love
it it was like the
moose and it just made my hair very
frizzy and like kind of tingly and I
didn't love it I was just running can
you guys tell need to catch my breath I
was excited because i do have fine thin
hair it really has no volume to it so i
was excited to get this I've only tried
it out about twice basically what you do
is you just pump a little bit into your
hand and comb it through your hair and
says that you can use it on dry or wet
hair I have used it on both and so far I
actually do think that it works the two
times that I've used it i've been pretty
impressed with it and so to remember I
just I've just been leaving it on my
bathroom counter so I remember to use it
because I actually I really did like
what it did to my hair I have it in
right now I don't know if you guys could
tell I just had my hair up to but yeah
so far it's working pretty good for me
and I will definitely keep trying this
another product that was in here is the
nuk see hooli prodigies what I don't
know it's the nucks eat multi-purpose
dry oil came in a little bag of course
which is good for if oil spills it's
kind of a disaster but this is what this
little guy looks like so it says it is
to nourish repair and soften face body
and hair in a single step with a
concentration of six precious botanical
oils and vitamin E this unique dry oil
is quickly absorbed for silky smooth
skin and beautiful glossy hair it
doesn't have oh here it is it's usually
$29 so obviously this is just like a
little guy of it I really do like oils I
have quite a few right now so I will
just wait until one of those you know
gets gets down there little further and
I feel like I need to open another oil
and then that would try it out I just
I'm a huge fan of oils from my face my
body of my hair so I just have like four
open right now another item in here is
food I was doula food it's from sunbelt
Baker eats there fudge dip chocolate
chewy granola bar looks like this it
says the granola bars are brought to
your community each week which means you
get a snack with bakery fresh taste and
no preservatives there are fifty cents
for a single or 269 for a multi pack box
my husband really loves granola bar
like we always have granola bars in the
house for him so i think i will just
slip this into his bag we also got some
deodorant in here which not mad about
that it is from secret outlast their ex
trend invisible solid so a little sample
guy of this it says it gives a dry
application for the right amount of
coverage when you need it and continuous
48-hour order protection I never really
believed that I feel like you need to
put deodorant on when you wake up in the
morning that's just my thing but I do
like this little guy these are really
handy to like throw in a purse or clutch
when you're going to be gone all night
and let's see ooh and that smells good I
like secret they're one of my favorite
brands of deodorant so yay nothing in
here is a nail polish color it's from
sinful nails these are usually a dollar
ninety-nine this is what my color looks
like it's a hot pink in VIP I believe it
was so I really did like this I just had
it all my nails not too long ago I can
put a picture in here so you can see
what it looks like on its on top of my
nail her nails but I wear nail her nails
you can paint them with a regular nail
polish as long as they don't have any
like 3d designs or glitter you can paint
right over them and so that's what is
pictured in the photo that i showed but
this was a really bright bright pink
color it's like perfect for spring and
summer but it almost was like a little
too bright like I wore it for three days
and I was like I'm still blending myself
but very pretty and I really do like the
sinful shine colors I have just a few of
them mostly from Influenster boxes but I
really do like them in my most recent
influencer box again I will leave
influencer listed below but I also did
receive my mei ipsius so cute like it's
travel themed and I love that because I
love traveling i thought i would share
this with you guys here because i'm not
going to do a may obscene or ii eldest
because of the products in it i didn't
feel like i would have enough to
actually use so i just wanted to go over
the bag real quick with you in this haul
video but one of the items in here is
from hikari and it is a shimmer bronzer
so it looks like this i just kind of rub
them all together and that's what i came
up with so that's pretty I don't have a
shimmer bronzer so I don't know we'll
see I don't have anything from Hikari
there but I posted a picture of my Ipsy
bag and a lot of people said that they
really liked this so i will be excited
to try it another item in here is from
it cosmetics there no tag waterproof gel
eyeliner it looks like this I don't have
anything from it cosmetics but I hear a
lot of like really good things about
them and I'm excited to try this
especially because it Mike running low
on all of my black eyeliners so that is
what that one looks like i will
definitely be trying this one out very
soon with skincare this month this is
from an OTS maybe I know TS it's their
20 remedy acne poor deep cleanser it
looks like this I always do like having
cleansers around so i will definitely be
putting this in my collection looks like
it's really good to travel with two
because it's a little mini guy and then
for my last two items i got something
from mellow cosmetics which I don't have
anything from mellow yet it's a lipstick
in the color electro which is a very
like bright reddish orange it looks more
orange than it actually is on camera
it's more red i would say i don't know
if i will use this i might be holding on
to this for a giveaway i haven't
swatched it or anything yet mostly just
because i don't wear a lot of like reds
and oranges so i don't know we'll see
we'll see how i feel i might be doing at
another giveaway soon this might be in
it so i don't know maybe my last item in
here is a brush this is from v Ramona I
think they said this was like one of
their smudge brushes I'm not going to
take it off a plastic because i think i
am gonna give this away as well I just
have a couple brushes like this and I
actually don't use them a lot so I feel
like I could throw this in for a
giveaway as well so that is everything
that I received in my may epsy bag I
just felt like I didn't have enough
products like last time I was able to do
lips and eyes and cheeks I really didn't
have a lot to be able to do like a full
tutorial this month and what's may be
giving away a few items I didn't want to
use them just for one tutorial so i
thought i would share here with you guys
what I got from my may FC bag if you're
interested in getting epsy and getting a
glam bag with four to five products
every month i will leave a link down
below moving along I was so excited
recently to become enough
liat with sigma beauty sigma beauty is
one of the first like bigger brands that
i bought makeup from actually about
makeup brushes from them i talked about
a few of them in my favorite brushes
video and i just i'm really excited to
be working with a company like sigma
just because i started buying from them
even before i got on youtube and I just
really liked so many of their products
and when I got accept it as an affiliate
they sent a welcome package and it came
with quite a few products in there and
if you follow me on my snapchat I showed
it to everyone and I was just like so
overwhelmed I've never gotten a box like
that from a brand before and it just
like was so surreal to me it was so cool
so I want to show you guys of what i got
from sigma so they sent along quite a
few brushes and i'm pretty excited about
it i'm not gonna lie one of the first
ones that i pulled out was a brush that
i've seen so much about and it's their
3d HD kabuki brush so it looks like this
it's like super unique and i definitely
need to watch it a few videos to see
like best practice when using it because
i'm really not sure how to use it i
didn't want to use anything until I
hauled them so I've been like so anxious
to do this video but I don't know I just
think it looks so cool so I'm excited to
try it another one that came through is
the buff and blend it is the e39 I feel
like this one looks so interesting
because I feel like it will do what it
says it can buff the products in but
then also blend them out it gets such a
unique shape I don't think I have any
sort of brushes like this so I'm super
curious to try out the e39 another verse
that came through is the medium sweeper
and this is an e 54 this looks like it
will be really good for placing like
pigments or foiled shadows or anything
that like I maybe want to spray my brush
with like mac fix+ on and then be able
to Pat the shadows on this looks like a
brush that I'm going to want to use for
that so that is the e 54 and then the
last brush I am like so excited about
and it is the e 06 for winged liner it
looks like this it is such a tiny brush
like can you guys even see that but i
love it because it looks like it would
really help like crazy with winged liner
I've seen this in a lot of favorites and
I believe this was in like the love
Sarah E
collection or something like that like
she picked your favorite Sigma brushes
and I'm pretty sure the e 06 was in
there and I just see a lot of people
talk about it how good it is for winged
eyeliner and I need all the help I can
get when it comes to winged liner so I'm
so excited to try out the e 06 and then
speaking of wind liner they also sent
along a few makeup products as well a
little eyeliner in wicket which is black
I have heard so much about this gel
liner and I am so excited to get it and
now I have a brush to be able to use it
to like that's just pretty awesome so
I'm really excited to try this out
because my other gel eyeliner that I
have is just completely dried out and
gross and not good but I mean here's
what it looks like it's just gel
eyeliner it's black I'm excited to use
it I can't wait I'll let you guys know
how it goes and I also got the corps de
rosa aqua powder the packaging looks
like this and then on the inside has a
mirror and then it looks like this i'm
actually not totally positive i think
this is a blush I mean it looks like a
blush to me I don't know you guys see
that doesn't that look like a really
like pretty like bronzy type of blush
but I think that's what I'm going with I
can always look it up online of course
as well but that is the core Dave Rosa
or a powder to Aqua powder hello then I
also got a lipstick and I'm so excited
about this lipstick it is the in spades
power lipstick and a lot about their
power lipsticks and I just think in this
sheet is so gorgeous it looks like a
really like pinky neutral color and I'm
excited to try it and I really like the
packaging like it feels like super heavy
duty and like luxurious like it's heavy
I love it so that was the in spades
power lipstick and the last thing that
they sent I like nearly died over I'm
not even kidding because it is their
Express glove so it looks like this and
it's just a it's for rush cleaning and
oh my word i have already used this
twice i'm sorry i took it on the
packaging because i had to use it it has
made cleaning my brushes so much easier
i just kind of like slip it on my hand
like this and then it has like grooves
and edges and ridges and you rub your
brush over it with the soap and it just
makes it so easy Sigma has a lot of
really good brush cleaners they have a
glove they have a man
that's and I just was like blown away
when I saw this I was like oh my gosh
this is something that I've need it for
so long because I hate using like my
palm to wash brushes and by the time you
get down like your hands are just
disgusting I mean you put this on or
even just like lay it down in the sink
and use it to clean your brushes it
makes the process so much easier i'm so
excited i have one of these thank you to
sigma for sending me some amazing
products believe everything that i got
listed below and i'm just so so thankful
to sigma for sending me such a terrific
box as soon as i can because i know it's
getting dark because it's about to storm
and i don't have light this is the story
of my life I'm sorry I'm trying to find
lights it's not working out hey grace
and Stella sent me a few items as well
to review i have two different items to
share because first they sent me their
bronze doll it's their self tanning
spray express bronzer it looks like this
and then it came with a matte as well to
spray it it kind of threw me off a
little bit that it's actually like a
spray like an aerosol spray I guess I
was just expecting and loose like you
seen with a lot of different self
tanners that come with mitts and
unfortunately this just did not really
do anything for me I didn't notice a tan
at all I would like when I applied it
and I look what let it sit for like the
six to eight hours but when I showered
it just it came off and I'm not gonna
sleep in self tanner I sleep with
husband and a dog and it just that's not
gonna work and I don't want it on more
than eight hours like it just I don't
know it's weird i don't want to spend my
whole debt like the reason why i don't
really love self tanners is because I
feel like I can't do anything like I
work out a lot you put a self tanner on
you can't work out like I don't know not
my thing so I don't know I did not love
this I would not be able to recommend it
and I did let grace and style and know
that I'm just kind of give them my
feedback and they were very appreciative
of it when I asked if they could send me
one other thing to review and so they
sent me some eye masks so they sent me
these anti wrinkle plus energizing I
masks and I'm so happy to say that I
freaking love these I just posted a
bottom on Instagram just saying like how
much I love them and it's still funny
because you know companies aren't going
to have a stellar product every single
time like color pop is one of my
favorite companies and I absolutely hate
their gel liner and the
platforms I hate it hate him but I love
color pop you know so even though I
tried one product from a company and
didn't love it I was really really glad
to get something else and try again
because I truly ended up loving these I
wear them so much like if you follow me
on snapchat it's like every morning is
me drinking my coffee with my eye masks
on so I'm their anti wrinkle energizing
I mass they say it's like an energy
drink for your eyes I totally agree with
that because they are so cooling and
they just feel so good I puff and
hydrate and you leave them on for about
20 to 30 minutes I usually leave them on
for probably closer to 30 minutes just
because I absolutely love the way they
feel they're easy to put on they're just
little gold they're kind of slimy
because like they're saturated in like
the magic they're saturated in magic but
they don't slide all over your face
which I appreciate because I put them on
got my coffee set at my office and work
in the morning it's not something where
you have to like lay down so they don't
fall off which I really appreciate that
but they just say feel so good I really
do think they like pep up tired eyes
like if I have a night especially that I
didn't sleep well my dog was up a lot no
I'm not feeling good just didn't get
much sleep and you can see the huge bags
under the eyes like this is an absolute
must for me so really really happy with
these if you're looking for a good eye
mask I definitely suggest these from
grace and Stella they also did give me a
twenty percent coupon code it's not an
affiliate code I don't make money off
it's just a money-saving code for you
guys I think it's just summing at the 20
but I can leave it here and link it in
the description box below definitely
recommend to the eye masks maybe not so
much the bronzer but they do also have
quite a few other products if you want
to check out but the one that I can
definitely put my stamp of approval on
is thy masks PR why's that were sent to
me one is a concealer and it is from I
am green mind it calm it just looks like
this and I'm really curious about it
because it's like a powder but it's
under Ike its a bright eyes under eye
brightener that's what it is ok so i got
like a little card in the mail as well
and it says we are launching our bright
eyes and strobing highlighters campaign
ok and i guess they have a coupon code
as well oh ok so for fifteen percent off
you can use the code IM green samantha
March 15
I'm assuming this is not an affiliate
link but it's just for a bright I under
concealer again the company is IM
green-minded and i am really really
curious to try this I will have to go to
the website to see because I feel like
you'd have to put something on that I
don't know I have no idea i don't know i
will go the website I'll figure it out
but I got this in the mail recently and
I wanted to share it with you i will
leave it linked below i'm sure i will
have a review this upcoming sometime
soon so thank you to i am green-minded
for an under eye brightener I need more
of those in my life final thing PR why's
that I got is from dodo lashes and they
sent me these lashes and the style d 105
I believe they are so this is what they
look like I did wear them out the other
night um I don't know they have a very
thick band and it felt kind of heavy on
my eyes but I don't know I didn't mind
him I'm not very familiar with dodo
lashes but they reach out to me on
instagram and asked if they could send
me a pair and i do love lashes so here's
kind of a close-up of the d 105 I can
leave these linked below to the dodo
website but yeah I think I just need to
wear them a little bit more to evil
actually give a review for him but they
do have a really thick band if you don't
like that you might not like the 105 but
for me they just take a little little
getting used to you know I did a little
bit of shopping at CVS I picked up a few
things from our dell they were having a
buy one get one free on our lashes and I
was like duh and I meant to get wispies
but if you can see I got two different
styles and that is not what i meant to
do i meant to get two of these but i
somehow picked up these and i really do
not like these lashes i still need to go
back and see if they will let me
exchange him because i love the ardell
wispies like this this is what i love i
want more of these so i need to go back
and see if they'll let me exchange them
but i got some ardell wispies i also got
some skincare from garnier I i just love
garnier I skincare I have so much of it
one is a moisturizer i'm almost out of
my moisturizer this is the moisture
rescue it looks like this i have used
this for years and years and in my first
skin care video this is what i meant
using and I say it's a Holy Grail and
that is totally true i've been using
this since my college days but i like
this because it's only eight dollars and
in m's either my last skincare hall or
skin care video I talked about the
Garnier they have a new moisturizer come
out the anti fatigue whatever its
eighteen dollars and honestly I feel
like they're like super similar so why
not get this for half the price it's I
love it it's great and I'm almost out of
that moisturizer and I haven't had it
very long and these lasts for a long
time and the CBS was having Garnier buy
one get one half off so I was like okay
why not try this new sleeping cream
because I'm really into sleeping creams
lately that says it's a miracle
anti-fatigue sleeping cream too
intensely hydrate and reduce wrinkles
for rest at younger looking skin this is
what it looks like I just picked this up
like two days ago so I have not used it
yet but I'm super excited about it I use
the first day beauty sleeping cream
almost every night and I'm starting to
put a huge dent in it I'm like no I need
more sleeping creams so that's why I
picked this one up this is what the
bottle looks like i'm so excited to try
this i really do use so much Garnier
skin care I'd love it for whatever
reason i don't really like the Garnier
hair care but the skin care i'm all
about it's usually pretty pretty
affordable and you can find out at drug
stores so pretty excited to try this out
and have this back in my life i haven't
had this moisturizer for a few months
and it's made me so sad i just had to
come back to it hang up forward this
haul video fool I've try not to make it
too long but I have a lot of products to
go over with you about everything that I
mentioned will be linked in the
description box below if you guys like

it a thumbs up I think I will have a few
more hauls coming up and the new
