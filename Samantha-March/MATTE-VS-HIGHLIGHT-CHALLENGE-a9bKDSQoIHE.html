today's video we are going to try
something a little bit different so
about a week or so ago I saw that
Jacqueline Hill posted a video where she
did one side of her face I'll highlight
it and glowed up and then the other side
of her face Oh Matt and the entire time
I was watching the video I just thought
I want to do this too it was so
interesting seeing the end result and
seeing which side of her face that she
liked better and for me personally I
typically tend to always highlight and
really go for like something glowy but
there are times where I prefer in a more
matte look but I have never done my face
1/2 and 1/2
I don't maybe you have let us know no
I'm going to doing one side of my face
highlight it the other side of my face
max I want to see what they look like I
want to see the differences and I'm
really curious to see which side I
prefer so if you are ready to get into
the highlight versus Matt challenge
mmm-hmm why don't we go ahead and get
started okay so we are all zoomed in
ready to go I'm going to do this on my
face highlighted and this side of my
face
Matt hopefully I can keep that together
throughout the video so I'm going to
start with a primer normally when I do
tutorial type of videos I start with my
eyes but this isn't a tutorial at all
and I'm not doing any sort of crazy eye
look it's just an experiment if you will
so for my highlighted side I'm going to
use the pure no filter primer it is a
blurring primer but I noticed that it
almost kind of reminded me a bit of the
Becca backlight priming filter but know
how much to use since I'm only doing
half my face this is gonna be weird and
on the other side I'm going to use my
only identifying primer that I own which
is the Milani prime shield this is the
mattifying and pore minimizing primer
looks like this is kind of a silicone
base power oh that was probably too much
for only half of my face but it's okay
so go ahead and blend this one in for a
foundation on the Kualoa side I'm going
to use the Loreal Pro glow my shade is
in 207 and sand beige I feel like this
was my glowy astound Asian that I have
right now is gonna dot a little bit on
my face usually I hate
putting my fingers in makeup but I
didn't want to pour it directly onto the
Beautyblender cuz I'm gonna use the same
beauty blender so I don't really ever
adopt makeup on my face so I don't know
if that was enough or if that was too
much I don't really know and then I'm
going to use the morphe I think this is
called the flawless sponge then go ahead
on the oven and on the map side of my
face I had a really hard time finding a
matte foundation because if you guys
don't know I'm not a huge fan of like
really matte foundations but I do have a
sample of the Laura Mercier flawless a
fusion foundation and this one is really
really matte I'm in the shade buff so
I'm gonna go ahead and use this one I
did recommend this one in my Sephora vib
sale video you like this foundation even
though it is more matte and more full
coverage I still really did like it so
it has a little like drill further so
I'm just gonna go ahead and Pat them on
my face I probably for sure use too much
on this side because I always forget
that this is like a little bit go such a
long way because it is so full coverage
and then I'm going to use the other side
of my Beauty sponge and just blend that
one out okay so here we are after
foundation and primer I feel like the
Laura Mercier foundation is definitely a
couple shades darker than the L'Oreal
but I don't know if I noticed any huge
difference yet between Matt and glowy
but let's move on to concealer over
concealer on the glowy side I'm also
going to use the L'Oreal infallible Pro
glow concealer and place them into under
eyes here I almost went to do the other
side I don't know if you noticed that
but I almost did it then I'm going to
blend this foot out then for my Mac side
I had a kind of a hard time at picking a
concealer I'm going to use the heart
shape tape I don't know if I have a
concealer that's necessarily like this
is matte where some of them are like
glowy or radiant finish or things like
but figure the heart shaped tape is
pretty matte and it's also full coverage
so it kind of goes along with the
foundation that we have so I'm going to
use the other end of my beauty sponge
and blend that one out and then to a set
the concealer on the highlight side I'm
going to use the alarm RCA this is the
secret brightening powder so this one in
my opinion brightens the under eyes of
course as the name would suggest and I
really do enjoy this when I've never
tried the original Laura Mercier but
it's because I tend to go for the bright
under eyes so that's why I bought the
secret brightening powder and I really
could enjoy it so I'm just gonna apply
that with my Beauty sponge and then on
the other side I'm going to use this one
from a pixie it is just a translucent
powder it's fairly new word to me but I
didn't really notice it being super
brightening at all so I'm going to use
the other end of my Beauty Blender like
that one as well okay I'm gonna let
these both bake for just a few minutes
but off-camera I'm gonna go ahead and
fill in my brows so I'm gonna do a
little bit more for the face before we
move on to the eyes because the eyes are
just gonna be like so minimal I don't
know what do you guys think can you tell
so far I don't know if I see a huge
difference yet so for my bronzer on the
highlighting side I'm going to use the
Estee Lauder bronze goddess it has a
little bit of shimmer in it I don't know
if you'd be able to see on camera but it
does have a little bit of shimmer to it
and I didn't really have any other
shimmer browsers I'm going to use the
morphe M 5 to 7 to apply it and then on
the matte side I'm going to use my og
the Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer
it's a little sample size and my morphe
r22 apply to the Mac side watch I
realize that I had quite a few shimmery
blushes or just like even if they
weren't like full shimmer more of like
shimmer esque type of blushes but I feel
like this one is pretty darn shimmery
and fun this is from a pixie beauty in
Rome rose think it's the collab with
Aspen of art I'm going to use the Luxy
of 504 to apply to this side of my face
but I actually had trouble finding like
straight matte blushes I felt like I had
so many shimmer or luminous blushes but
not a whole lot of matte options the
blush that I ended up using is actually
the one in the Tarte and styled by her
brush palette it has some eyeshadows but
this is a straight matte blush it's
called cheeky so I'm going to use the
Sigma f40 to go ahead and apply this one
I don't know if these colors are gonna
be the same but we're not gonna match
anyways at the end so like no big deal
right so the eyes I am going to keep
pretty pretty basic because I feel like
you know kind of the point of this is
more of like the face and then obviously
the highlight at the end and stuff but
the two palettes that I'm going to use
for the luminous side I'm going to use
the Jaclyn hill morphe palette for the
matte side I'm going to use the Kat Von
D shade and light palette this is an all
matte eyeshadow palette but I think I'm
just really gonna go in with like two
colors so okay highlight side over here
Jotham hill panel I feel like I'm going
to get confused so I have my two e 40s
out so I'm just gonna first come in with
a brown shade I mean I don't have any
like sparkly Browns or whatnot so coming
into the Jaclyn hill palette I'm just
going to grab the shade pooter the third
one in the second row and apply that
into the crease I'm gonna grab my other
v40 from Sigma and I'm going to come
into the first shade here in the shade
and light palette and just that one into
the crease as well and in the chocolate
hill palette I'm going to take the
second shade which is a beam it looks
like it has maybe a little bit more glow
I'm going to use the sigma e55 and i'm
going to place this one really all over
the lid
and then in the shade and light palette
I'm going to take the third shade here
which is a white and then this is the
sigma e55 is going to apply this one all
over the lid as well I feel like a look
is so funny but so here are the
different eyes so again really simple I
just put a brown and each within a
shimmer white and one and all a matte in
the other so interesting I feel like
this one like this I I feel like looks
more awake it just looks bigger and I
haven't even put any like inner corner
or anything in it I feel like I can
definitely tell that I'm gonna go ahead
and add some mascara I kind of tripping
me out how much bigger one of my eyes
looks like it's just so it's so strange
so I'm gonna do a some liner in my
waterline on the highlight side I'm
going to use more of a white which again
just kind of helps open up the eyes and
then on the other side I'm going to use
just a plain old Brown so this one is
from Rimmel the exaggerated liner in in
the nude this has been one of my
favorite new fighters since forever and
then on the other side I'm going to use
the pier on point liner and this one is
in the shade down to earth just a
regular Brown does the matte Browns
really weren't all that different I'm
just gonna take this first shade here
and the kat von d palette and the Sigma
pencil brush the e30 I'm just going to
sweep that along both of the lower lash
lines just to give me a little a little
something here and take a little bit of
the shade right here
SBN a smoky but natural and I'm just
going to kind of like casually top that
onto the lower lash line just to give a
little bit of shimmer over here and then
also in the Jaclyn hill palette I'm
gonna take the first shade which is
called and light I just stuck my finger
in creamsicle the amount of times I put
my fingernails and makeup eye shadows
specifically it's just crazy so on this
side I'm going to go ahead and highlight
the inner corner this is the more feet
36 brush and then I'm also going to use
that same
in the same shade and I'm going to
highlight the brow bone of course I'm
not going to do that for the mat side
again I feel like this side it's just so
much more awake especially with that
added liner and the waterline okay so
that's going to be it for the eyes so
let's switch back to the face and
highlight half of my face totally normal
I actually just got the Oprah and
nikkietutorials collaboration sent to me
so it has the three lipsticks and then
like the little trio wheel here and I
feel like I always hear about how
blinding this highlight is and
nikkietutorials it's kind of known for
like the glow so I'm going to use this
for my highlight on this side of my face
this listen to me from octa Lee and
Oprah so big thank you to them I do like
go for highlights a lot I just bought my
first one at the altar 21 days of beauty
and blissful so I'm excited to try this
one out the highlight is called ever
glow I believe now they just said they
stuff in collaboration with
nikkietutorials and you can actually get
these separately so I think what I'm
gonna do is actually mix the two
lightest shades together I'm going to
use my Sigma so3 my favorite
highlighting brush and let's see what we
come up with oh my goodness that is a
and nikkietutorials
highlighter right there just kind of
experimenting I'm going to add some
along the see around your eyes which I
normally do but I don't do it quite as
like intense but you know I want to see
the difference here I want to see which
side I would really prefer do a little
bit of that I'm gonna do a little bit on
the side of my Cupid's bow and a little
bit on the side of my nose that's kind
of hard to do okay so here we have
highlight it oh my goodness
completely matte what do you guys think
what do you think what do you think what
do you think we still gotta do lips but
this is this is really weird me okay
let's finish off with some lip color and
then I will do something sprays too but
lip color first Tony
use another lip color from that Oprah
and nikkietutorials this one is in nude
potion so I'm gonna do what Jaclyn did
and just put it all over my lips first
she tried to do like half and half but
I'm just gonna do it all over my lips
and then I'll put gloss on one half okay
there is a nude potion that's really
pretty I do like though for lipsticks so
I'm excited to have a new one hmm I like
that okay so I'm gonna go ahead and add
this is a mac lipglass in under the
sheets I'm gonna go ahead and add it to
this side of my face I feel still even
though we are almost done I'm still like
my putting this on the right side I
don't know so makeup is complete I don't
have a mattifying setting spray but I do
have this one from tatcha which is the
luminous dewy skin mist and this this
makes you a dewy so I'm gonna go ahead
and try to spray just this side of my
face and after we have sprayed this is
the final result what do you think guys
so this is it let me know what you think
in the comments which side do you prefer
highlight or matte I have to say Jaclyn
because I know you're watching this
video I've been a subscriber of yours
for a long time I've supported you in a
lot of different ways but I'm really
upset with you right now why would you
make us do this because I like the matte
side so much more I can't believe it I
can't believe it
I honestly can't believe it but I agree
with what she said in her video that she
felt like the highlights I'd aged her
your girl's 30 I don't need nobody
helping me look older I need to look
younger and this side
I feel like does look younger it looks
fresher it looks more natural obviously
I mean hello but I actually do like the
matte side I'm completely I'm like
distraught right now we know your
thoughts so of course let me know your
comments do
like the highlights I'd more why do you
think you like it more do you prefer the
Matt site more are you gonna try this
challenge have you tried the challenge I
mean I don't think she really meant for
it to be a challenge but that's how I
took it I was like oh girl I'm gonna do
half my face highlighter and half my
face Matt and see which one I like
better and be super surprised at it I
mean I don't feel like I'm going to give
up high light cold turkey because that
would be devastating and I love my
highlights so much but I feel like every
single time I do my makeup I always
finish with highlight always like that's
it even if I'm just running out
somewhere I always finished with
highlight and I feel like now I will
actually be give my skin alone sometimes
I won't always highlight or at least not
highlight so much I know obviously in
this video I wanted to see the
differences so I wasn't gonna be like
I'm just gonna put a dab of highlight
here because that's not gonna help me
actually see the difference but somedays
I do go out looking like this the other
day my husband we were getting ready to
leave and he goes oh you got that light
on your cheeks again I was like yes
highlight do you like it and he was like
mmhmm I don't know what that meant I
don't know what that meant so I'm pretty
sure if Mitch was here he would be
saying he would like this site more - so
I'm surprised I'm surprised I don't know
if I regret now doing this challenge or
not but that is it for the highlight of
versus Matt challenge I really hope that
