today's video is going to be my may
favorites video I love recording
favorites videos and watching favorites
videos she's still fun to see the
products that people have actually like
really been loving on throughout the
month and I also have I think for the
first time ever a first like major fail
then I want to share with you guys I
know sometimes in favourites videos
people do like favorites and fails or
favorites and flops but usually I just
haven't like come across a product that
I have felt so strongly about that I had
to be like hey guys don't get this I
kind of have like a crazy story to share
with you guys that happened after I was
using a beauty product so I will be
sharing that as well yeah if you would
like to see my may favorites and my one
big giant fail please keep watching
different I have is an oldie but
seriously a goodie this is the bronze of
Champions box from Benefit Cosmetics I
truly don't think that you can get this
anymore but I wanted to just talk about
a few products inside that I truly love
I bought this last summer at the start
of summer I just thought it was such
like cute packaging and you got a bunch
of stuff inside and so it made it like a
good price you know deal wise but inside
you got a cream eyeshadow a powder
eyeshadow a lip gloss the hoola bronzer
their real mascara and the Watts up
highlighter I use everything out of this
box except for the lip gloss I'm not a
huge fan of lip gloss especially if
they're super sticky which that one is
just like so sticky it really doesn't
have any pigmentation so I tried it once
just to try it and then I've never
really touched it again the shadows I do
think are pretty they're not something
that I like reach for all the time but
the hoola bronzer is incredible if you
have not tried the benefit hoola bronzer
I highly suggest you do it's amazing
the they're real mascara I use all the
time this is what it looks like I use it
all the time I highly recommend this
this actually makes it look like you
have like false lashes on when you don't
and I freaking love that mascara and
then the what's up highlighter is just
phenomenal it's like a cream highlighter
I like to use it you either can use it
on your own or I even layer it I do the
what's up first and then I put a powder
highlighter over it and I just like
makes you beam
I just absolutely
those products and I've just found
myself reaching for my benefit buck so
much again so I love it so even though
you probably can't get the benefit box
anymore at those like three particular
products that I mentioned are just
amazing the product that I have that I'm
sure I've mentioned in a favorites video
in the past because I've had it for a
while but it's from else
it's one of their blush palettes and I
believe it's in the light shade so it
has a nice mirror on it which is pretty
cool but then it has these four shades
on it so you get like a light pink blush
a little bit of a darker pink over here
this one is like a pink coral but it has
sparkle in it I don't know if you can
see it so I don't wear it a whole lot
because of the sparkle but then this is
a really great bronzer shade and I
honestly use this more for that bronzer
shade than I do for the blushes but a
lot of times I'll pull this out to use
the bronzer and then on my plum as well
use the blush to like I have this
palette out and I've just been reaching
for it so much the mirror is also super
handy when I do my makeup at my desk I'm
sure that I've mentioned this in a
favorites video in the past but
seriously these elf just like little
blush palettes I just think are awesome
so I knew this was gonna be in a
favorites video like I just knew it but
it's from a Nastasia Beverly Hills it is
one of her glow kits I have mine in that
glow so it comes with four different
highlighters shades and it is just bomb
this is what the highlighter shades look
like I have used this in several several
tutorials already I got it during the
Sephora vib sale
it's incredible she actually has another
one called gleam that I do want to get
and I actually heard that more of these
that might be coming soon so I'm gonna
have to watch out for that but yes
Anasazi Beverly Hills I've just recently
started ordering from her once she has
our products available at Sephora now
cuz I like to get my points and you know
all that good stuff I've just been on a
roll ordering from her eye shadows lip
glosses and the that glow palette is
just amazing if you're looking for some
great highlighters check this out these
products were mentioned in my bridesmaid
glam makeup tutorial but I wanted to
mention them again just because I truly
love them so much they're from
Scandinavia and they are there setting
sprays so one is the makeup primer
setting spray so I spray this all
my face before I put any makeup down and
then the other one is the makeup
finishing spray and so obviously I use
this once my makeup is finished and I
spray it on my face to keep everything
in place I have just been reaching for
these every single day like once I get
my head what makeup look I'm gonna do I
just immediately go in and spray my face
like I love this primer I mentioned it
in my video that it just even alone once
you spray this your face just looks
better it has a nice like healthy glow
to it I swear it does like things to my
pores even when I just first sprayed
this on before applying any sort of
makeup or any other primer or anything
the skin just looks better and I
realized that this truly is helping keep
my makeup in place I went to this past
week in West Memorial Day and we were on
the water all day and I wore like very
very simple almost no makeup the first
day but I still spread this anyway and I
thought I still looked good by the end
of the night and then the next day I
actually wore a little bit more makeup
and still sprayed my face with this and
I still looked I thought in my opinion
even when I got home from a full day on
the boat I was like yeah my skin still
looks good my makeup still looks good
like I am just super impressed with
these skin and navy I sent them to me
and I am just so thankful for him
because region for him every day this
polish and it come as a surprise because
I have been using it so much and a lot
of different tutorials and talking about
it on Instagram but it is the Clinique
beyond perfecting a foundation and
concealer it looks like this I
absolutely love this guy I also picked
it up during the Sephora vib sale my
shade is in 6.5 butter milk I'm just
using it all the time it gives the skin
such a nice finish it's a very natural
looking but it's more on the matte side
so it's not gonna give like any sort of
like do eNOS our glowy look type of
thing unless you pair it with a primer
that does that but just on its own I
think it is just beautiful I've just
been reaching for it so much I'm like
use a different foundation but I don't
want to because I love it I think it
makes the skin look so good and it's
very long-lasting another product that I
bought during the Sephora vib sale that
I ended up just loving is from Tarte
it's the rainforest of the sea aqua
concealer it looks like this oh man do I
love this concealer and it's so strange
because concealers were never something
that I like would get excited about
or think too like mention in the
favorites video and the more that I use
them and try different ones out and I
actually see what they're doing and see
how they're improving my skin and under
my under eyes brightening the under eyes
I'm just like more and more impressed
with them every day but I really really
like this Tarte concealer it makes me
really want to try the rainforest of the
sea foundation as well to see if I like
it as much as the concealer and has I
kind of like funky smell to it like it
kind of smoke like paint almost I don't
know it's kind of weird and you see in
tutorials when I use it I usually put it
under one eye and then I buff it out and
then I do the next eye and buff it out
that's kind of how I do it because it
does dry very fast so that's how I like
to use its using the clinic foundation
every single day and then immediately
coming in with the tarte concealer i'm
just loving on this little guy so i have
a piece of clothing that i wanted to
share with you guys and I have not done
laundry in so long because we keep being
gone so don't mind me the shirts really
wrinkly cuz I totally had to pull it out
of like my little hamper but it's this
shirt that has the lipsticks the
lipsticks the lashes and the lipsticks
on it I got this from a top off clothing
which is the boutique that my
sister-in-law owns and I just love it I
wore it in one of my videos I've shared
about it on Instagram I just think it's
so cute for like a makeup lover it's
just like such the perfect shirt I've
been seeing more these come out so again
this is what it looks like it's just got
some lashes on there and some nice
lipsticks
it's such a comfy shirt too I love it I
can link it below to my sister-in-law
store but I just thought it was so cute
and I've been wearing it so much hence
why it's in my laundry but yeah
lipsticks and lashes gotta love it on
her shirt so I have some lippies to talk
with you guys about and actually this
month they are all from Kylie cosmetics
which a little surprised at but you know
I ended up I placed an order when she
came out with the glasses to kind of
like try something new because I don't
have a lot of glasses in my collection
and I ended up really liking them one of
my favorites is in like which looks like
this like is a very dark brown she came
up with three different glosses and like
is the darkest one out of them when I
did my Kylie cosmetics review video and
swatches I was like I don't think I'm
gonna like like
because I thought it was just a little
bit too dark on me but the more I wear
it the more like this is the one that
I'm gravitating towards and it totally
caught me by surprise I did not think
that would happen but it's just such a
very complementary color I think and
it's super glossy I like to do what I
mean the ending said in one of her
videos she like focuses it on the middle
of her lips and then slowly like starts
to take the product outwards because
that gives you the gloss right in the
center of your lips it's super glossy it
stays on for a long time I was very
impressed by the long-lasting wear of
these and I just find myself reaching
for like very often and then also from
Kylie cosmetics I picked up the all
three glosses but then I also picked up
one of her liquid lipsticks and it came
with the lip liner these are in the
Kandy K so this is what it looks like
candy canes just a really nice like
neutral pink color and I really really
like these lip liners they are very very
similar to the color pop liners and when
I say very very similar
I made the exact same ingredients in the
exact same order so there's that but to
add a much cheaper price such um that's
very interesting I don't really know
what I think about that yet but that's
not what this video is about but if you
like the color pop liners you are going
to like the Kylie cosmetics letters
because they are the same thing so
there's that but all of her liquid
lipsticks do come with a matching lip
liner so you can't just buy a lip liner
separately you can't buy the liquid
lipstick separately which kind of sucks
because they are like twenty nine
dollars or something super expensive and
then you have to pay like another forty
for shipping I'm exaggerating it's ten
but seriously
for shipping that's insanity but all of
those like gripes aside I actually
really do like the products of it so
again the liquid lipstick is it just a
really pretty pink neutral color I have
worn it in one of my tutorials I'm I
think it was the bridesmaid glam
tutorial that I wore it in because they
are also super super long lasting they
don't do weird inner rim things to my
lips and if I know that I need something
on all day long this is what I'm
grabbing for and I also just really do
like the lip liner but again I'd almost
rather just use the color pop liners to
be honest but from Kylie cosmetics and
candy Kay I really do
this shade in the formula so I got this
product in my Ipsy bag and I wasn't and
I think was my April Ipsy bag
I wasn't like super excited about it at
first because it's a blush and I'm kind
of like a take-it-or-leave-it with blush
sometimes I forget to put blush on it's
just not my favorite thing and I ended
up really loving it so it's from
Elizabeth Mott and it's called show me
your cheeks so comes in a little sample
size because it's an Ipsy but the color
is peach pink so it looks like this I do
use it in my Ipsy bag tutorial that I
did for April I actually do apply it to
my cheeks but it just gives a really
nice peachy pink glow to the cheeks and
it almost has just like a hint of
shimmer in there as well which i think
is really really pretty for summer I'm
finding myself gravitating towards more
like luminous and shimmer blushes and so
I don't know I just find myself reaching
for this on a lot which I did not think
would happen but I've really enjoyed it
so from Elizabeth Mott show me your
cheeks and peach pink very pretty summer
blush so another favorite i have is from
morphe and it is the 35o palette so I
finally got my hands on the three 500
palette I was so excited every time that
I went to order it was always sold out
and then finally I got it this is what
the inside of the 3500 looks like I
actually have 3/5 Oh like this is what I
used to do this makeup look there is a
tutorial that's either coming or has
already been posted but I'm filming
these videos in the same day so I filmed
this makeup tutorial look today as well
so will be coming if it's not already up
but it is just gorgeous I love the
oranges in here there's so many pretty
shimmery colors there's great transition
colors like it's just a beautiful
palette there's some really pretty like
deep rich Browns I mean it's just
gorgeous I've been doing so many
different looks with it and I'm glad
that I finally found a makeup tutorial
using it for YouTube like it's just
gorgeous
I use it so much if you can get your
hands on the 3 5l I definitely suggest
it morphe did just come out with 3/5 of
shimmer and 3/5 of maps so separate
palette with all the same colors as the
3/5 Oh just wants all shimmer ones all
matte I don't know if I'll purchase them
just because I'm not sure I really need
that in my life but if you guys have
ordered them and you think they're bomb
please leave in the comments below and
let me know if you think I need to order
it but
the og3 500 then my final favorite of
the month I've only had this for like a
week maybe but I was like should I wait
till next month to put it in my
favorites no because I'm literally have
been wearing it like every single day
since I got it I have to include it in
my favorites but it is the Jaclyn hill
and Becca cosmetics a champagne glow
face palette I believe is what the full
name of it is so this is what the inside
of it looks like it has a huge mirror
which is like super weird that can you
see my camera hello there it is but it
has a huge mirror inside but it has
three different blushes and then to
highlight shades the blushes are
beautiful I have amaretto on right now
and I just think this was a shade that I
wasn't excited for and I have worn it
nearly every single day it's such a
great neutral blush that I didn't
realize I was missing from my collection
like I have pinks I have peaches I have
a little bit of like shimmers in there I
do not have like a neutral blush and I
have just been using it so much
also the Rose a spritz which is like the
luminous blush is just amazing on its
own as a blush topper I like to put it
over emerado it's so gorgeous I haven't
tried out the coral blush a lot yet
because I've just been so obsessed with
amaretto but I'm sure it's beautiful as
well
the two highlighters one a champagne pop
which has already been released for
about a year but the other one is
Prosecco pop I have it on my cheeks
right now such a gorgeous gold it's
insane it's the only highlighter I've
been wearing since I got this palette in
the mail so that tells you how much I
love it I do have a full video going
over a full review of it showing all the
swatches of it and doing a demo of
several of the shades on my face so if
you want to check that out I will leave
it linked below but oh man I'm obsessed
with this palette alright so I think
that's the first time I've ever had
stopped filming and like go somewhere
and then come back had to go to a
doctor's appointment and I start filming
too late of course now that I've gotten
back and I want to tell you about my
fail it has heard a thunderstorm so my
lighting is probably looking right now I
apologize but I didn't want to talk to
you guys about this fail because I was
actually going to talk about last month
and then I just had too many favorites
like between the Sephora vib sale my
birthday like I just
too much going on so I thought I'd wait
and let you guys know and I thought
about skipping it again today but I was
like no I really wanted to tell you guys
a story if you guys follow me on
snapchat which she should I told it
there but basically it was about two
months ago I started noticing that my
lips just constantly hurt they
constantly felt dried out they
constantly felt chapped like if I looked
closely at them in the mirror I don't
know a better word to describe it but
then like puckered like they were like
tight like it was the weirdest thing it
hurts so bad I started to get sores on
them I was like breaking out on my lips
and really once the breakout started I
was like something's wrong here like
what what's happening because at first
when they just felt like dried and
chapped I was like oh I'm using too many
liquid lipsticks I'm not moisturizing my
lips enough you know maybe I need to
keep using more lip liners with liquid
lipsticks like you know you know
obviously it's a problem that I'm I'm
doing something wrong so then the
breakouts started happening on my lips
which is super super painful I was
getting blisters like right in the
middle of my lip do they win one night
my husband went to kiss me and I was
like please don't my lips hurt so bad
like I know I can't and I was like okay
something is going on
so I started to examine the products
that I've been using and all of the lip
products and the only thing that I had
changed
was I started to use this like gos lip
balm it looks like this it's like in a
little egg guy and then when you open it
up it looks like this I received this as
a gift and you can see how much I used
like it's almost gone it was like big
before I received it as a gift and I
always have a lip gloss next to my
computer and I always have a lip gloss
in my bathroom I always have a lip gloss
in my purse because I'm constantly
trying to like moisturize and keep my
lips hydrated because I wear lipsticks
and like what lipstick so much so this
was the one that was in my bathroom
which meant every morning after I was
washing my face I was applying this
every night when after I wash my face I
apply that as if I get out of the shower
I applied this I was constantly using it
and it did huge damage to my lips and
once I figured out that this was
probably it I started doing research on
this and oh my
word there are so many cases out there
of people who have had like blisters
forming on their lips and other sores on
their lips because of using this AOS
bomb and I said something on my Facebook
page like has anyone else experienced
this and so many people were out back I
was like the same thing happened to me
the same thing happened to me I stopped
using this immediately after I looked it
up and saw how many issues people were
having I immediately stopped within five
days my lips are completely healed
completely healed back to normal Norma
breakouts no more blisters no more dry
chapped feeling my lips are 100% back to
normal after I stopped using the eos
which showed me that is exactly what was
causing the issue with my lips it was
crazy
now some people I've also said this is
what they use every day they have no
problems with it they love it but for me
this did not work I've never come across
something like this that hurt me so bad
and literally like my lips were starting
to look deformed like seriously it was
so freakin bizarre so I have stopped
using the EOS I'm gonna throw this the
way I've been holding on to it cuz I
wanted to tell you guys my story and
show you guys that I'm throwing it away
because it just it was insanity so that
was a huge mega fail for me to show you
guys my story so that was my big old
fail thanks for listening and that is
gonna be everything for my may favorites
and my one big ol mega fail in there as
well I hope you guys enjoyed this video
