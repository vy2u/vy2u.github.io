today's video is going to be my may
favorites video I love recording
favorites videos and watching favorites
videos she's still fun to see the
products that people have actually like
really been loving on throughout the
month and i also have I think for the
first time ever a first like major fail
then I want to share with you guys I
know sometimes in favorites videos
people do like favorites and fails or
favorites and flops but usually I just
haven't like come across a product that
I have felt so strongly about that I had
to be like hey guys don't get this I
kind of have like a crazy story to share
with you guys that happened after i was
using a beauty product so i will be
sharing that as well but if you would
like to see my may favorites and my one
big giant fail please keep watching
different i have is an oldie but
seriously a goodie this is the bronze of
champions box from Benefit Cosmetics I
truly don't think that you can get this
anymore but I wanted to just talk about
a few products inside that i truly love
i bought this last summer as a start of
summer i just thought it was such like
cute packaging and you got a bunch of
stuff inside and so it made it like a
good price you know deal wise but inside
you got a cream eyeshadow a powder
eyeshadow a lip gloss the hoola bronzer
they're real mascara and the Watts up
highlighter I use everything out of this
box except for the lip gloss I'm not a
huge fan of lip gloss especially if
they're super sticky which that one is
just like so sticky it really doesn't
have any pigmentation so I tried it once
just to try it and then I've never
really touched it again the shadows I do
think are pretty they're not something
that I like reach for all the time but
the hoola bronzer is incredible if you
have not tried the benefit hoola bronzer
I highly suggest you do it's amazing the
they're real mascara I use all the time
this is what it looks like I use it all
the time I highly recommend this this
actually makes it look like you have
like false lashes on when you don't and
I freaking love that mascara and then
the Watts up highlighter is just
phenomenal it's like a cream highlighter
I like to use it you either can use it
on your own or I even layer it I do the
blood sup first and then I put a powder
highlighter over it and I just like
makes you beam I just absolutely
those products and I've just found
myself reaching for my benefit box so
much again so I love it so even though
you probably can't get the benefit box
anymore those like three particular
products that i mentioned are just
amazing a product that i have that i'm
sure i've mentioned in a favorites video
on the past because i've had it for a
while but it's from elf it's one of
their blush palettes and i believe it's
in the light shade so it has a nice
mirror on it which is pretty cool but
then it has these four shades on it so
you get like a light pink blush a little
bit of a darker pink over here this one
is like a pink coral but it has Sparkle
and it i don't know if you can see it so
i don't wear it a whole lot because of
the sparkle but then this is a really
great bronzer shade and i honestly use
this more for that bronzer shade than i
do for the blushes but a lot of times
I'll pull this out to use the bronzer
and then I my plum as well use the blush
to like I have this palette out and I've
just been reaching for it so much the
mirror is also super handy when I do my
makeup at my desk I'm sure that I've
mentioned this in a favorites video in
the past but seriously these else these
like little blush palette I just think
are awesome so I knew this was going to
be in a favorites video like I just knew
it but it's from Anastasia Beverly Hills
it is one of her glow kits I have mine
in that glow so it comes with four
different high lighter shades and it is
just bombed this is what the high
lighter shades look like I have used
this in several several tutorials
already I got it during the Sephora vib
sale it's incredible she actually has
another one called gleam that I do want
to get and I actually heard that more of
these that might be coming soon so I'm
gonna have to watch out for that but yes
anastacio Beverly Hills I just recently
started ordering from her once she has
her products available at sephora now
cuz I like to get my points and you know
all that good stuff I've just been on a
roll ordering from her eye shadows lip
glosses and that glow palette is just
amazing if you're looking for some great
highlighters check this out these
products were mentioned in my bridesmaid
glam makeup tutorial but i wanted to
mention them again just because i truly
love them so much they're from
scandinavia and they are they're setting
sprays so one is the makeup primer
setting spray so i spare this
over my face before I put any makeup
down and then the other one is the
makeup finishing spray and so obviously
i use this once my makeup is finished
and i sprayed on my face to keep
everything in place i have just been
reaching for these every single day like
once i get my head what makeup look I'm
going to do I just immediately go in and
spray my face like I love this primer I
mentioned it in my video that it just
even alone once you spray this your face
just looks better it has a nice like
healthy glow to it I swear it does like
things to my pores even when I just
first spray this on before applying any
sort of makeup or any other primer or
anything the skin just looks better and
I realized that this truly is helping
keep my makeup in place I went to this
past weekend was memorial day and we
were on the water all day and I were
like very very simple almost no makeup
the first day but I still spread this
anyway and I thought I still looked good
by the end of the night and then the
next day actually wore a little bit more
makeup and still sprayed my face with
this and I still looked I thought in my
opinion even when I got home from a full
day on the boat I was like yeah my skin
still looks good my makeup still looks
good like I am just super impressed with
these skin and navy i sent them to me
and I'm just so thankful for him because
region forum everyday this polishing
come as a surprise because I've been
using it so much and a lot of different
tutorials and talking about it on
Instagram but it is the clinic beyond
perfecting a foundation and concealer it
looks like this I absolutely love this
guy I also picked it up during the
Sephora vib sale my shade is in 6.5
buttermilk I'm just using it all the
time it gives the skin such a nice
finish it's a very natural looking but
it's more on the mat side so it's not
going to give like any sort of like
doing a sour glowy look type of thing
unless you pair it with a primer that
does that but just on its own I think it
is just beautiful i've just been
reaching for it so much i'm like use a
different foundation but i don't want to
because i love it i think it makes the
skin look so good and it's very
long-lasting another product that i
bought during the sephora vib sale that
i ended up just loving is from tarte
it's the rainforest of the sea aqua
concealer it looks like this Oh manda I
love this concealer and it's so strange
because concealers were never something
that I like would get excited about
or think too like mention in the
favorites video and the more that I use
them and try different ones out and I
actually see what they're doing and see
how they're improving my skin and under
my undereyes brightening the under eyes
I'm just like more and more impressed
with them every day but I really really
like this tower concealer it makes me
really want to try the rainforest of the
sea foundation as well to see if I like
it as much as the concealer and has I
kind of like funky smell to it like it
kind of smoke like paint almost i dodo
it's kind of weird and you see in
tutorials when i use it i usually put it
under one eye and then I buff it out and
then I do the next I and buff it out
that's kind of how I do it because it
does drive very fast so that's how i
like to use its using the clinic
foundation every single day and then
immediately coming in with the tar
concealer I'm just loving on this little
guy so I have a piece of clothing that I
wanted to share with you guys and I have
not done laundry and so long because we
keep being gone so don't mind me the
shirts really ring clicks I totally had
to pull it out of like my little hamper
but it's this shirt that has the
lipsticks the lipsticks the lashes and
the lipsticks on it I got this from a
top off clothing which is the boutique
that my sister-in-law owns and I just
love it I wore it in one of my videos
I've shared about it on Instagram I just
think it's so cute for like a makeup
lover it's just like such the perfect
shirt I've been seeing more of these
come out so again this is what it looks
like it's just got some lashes on there
and some nice lipstick it's such a comfy
shirt too I love it I can link it below
to my sister-in-law store but I just
thought it was so cute and I've been
wearing it so much hence why it's in my
laundry but yeah lipsticks and lashes
gotta love it on a shirt so I have some
lippies to talk with you guys about and
actually this month they are all from
Kylie cosmetics which a little surprised
at but you know I ended up I placed an
order when she came out with the glasses
to kind of like try something new
because I don't have a lot of glasses in
my collection and I ended up really
liking them one of my favorites is in
like which looks like this like is a
very dark brown she came up with three
different glasses and like is the
darkest one out of them when i did my
Kylie cosmetics review video and
swatches I was like I don't think I'm
gonna like like
because I thought it was just a little
bit too dark on me but the more I
where's the more like this is the one
that I'm gravitating towards and it
totally caught me by surprise I did not
think that would happen but it's just
such a very complementary color I think
and it's super glossy I like to do what
I made the end Singh said in one of her
videos she like focuses it on the middle
of her lips and then slowly like starts
to take the product out words because
that gives you the glass right in the
center of your lips it's super glossy it
stays on for a long time I was very
impressed by the long-lasting where of
these and I just find myself reaching
for like very often and then also from
Kylie cosmetics I picked up to all three
glasses but then I also picked up one of
her liquid lipsticks and it came with
the lip liner these are an to candy k so
this is what it looks like candy canes
just a really nice like neutral pink
color and I really really like these lip
liners they are very very similar to the
colour-pop liners and when I say very
very similar I made the exact same
ingredients in the exact same order so
there's that but to add a much cheaper
price such um that's very interesting I
don't really know what I think about
that yet but that's not what this video
is about but if you like the color pop
liners you are going to like the kinda
like as many lenders because they are
the same thing so there's that but all
of her liquid lipsticks do come with a
matching lip liner so you can't just buy
a lip liner separately you can't buy the
liquid lipstick separately which kind of
sucks because they are like twenty nine
dollars or something super expensive
then you have to pay like another 40 for
shipping I'm exaggerating its 10 but
seriously for shipping that's insanity
but all of those like gripes aside I
actually really do like the products of
it so again the liquid lipstick is it
just a really pretty pink neutral color
I have worn it in one of my tutorials
I'm I think it was the bridesmaid glam
tutorial that I wore it in because they
are also super super long-lasting they
don't do weird inner rim things to my
lips and if I know that I need something
on all day long this is what I'm
grabbing for and i also just really do
like the lip liner but again i'd almost
rather just use the colour-pop liners to
be honest but from Kylie cosmetics and
candy ki really do
like the shade in the formula so I got
this product in my Ipsy bag and I wasn't
it i think was my april Ipsy bag i
wasn't like super excited about it at
first because it's a blush and i'm kind
of like a ticket or leave it with blush
sometimes I forget to put blush on it's
just not my favorite thing and I ended
up really loving it so it's from
Elizabeth Mott and it's called show me
your cheeks so it comes in a little
sample size because it's an Ipsy the
color is peach pink so it looks like
this I do use it in my Ipsy bag tutorial
that I did for april i actually do apply
to my cheeks but it just gives a really
nice peachy pink glow to the cheeks and
it almost has just like a hint of
shimmer in there as well which i think
is really really pretty for summer i'm
finding myself gravitating towards more
like luminous and shimmer blushes and so
I don't know I just find myself reaching
for this on a lot which I did not think
would happen but I've really enjoyed it
so from Elizabeth Matt show me your
cheeks and peach pink very pretty summer
blush so another favorite I have is from
morphe and it is the 350 palette so I
finally got my hands on the 350 pilot I
was so excited every time that I went to
order it was always sold out and then
finally I got it this is what the inside
of the 350 looks like I actually have
the 350 like this is what I used to do
this makeup look there is a tutorial
that's either coming ours already been
posted but I'm filming these videos in
the same day so I filmed this makeup
tutorial look today as well so will be
coming if it's not already up but it is
just gorgeous i love the oranges in here
there's so many pretty shimmery colors
there's great transition colors like
it's just a beautiful palette there's
some really pretty like deep rich Browns
I mean it's just gorgeous I've been
doing so many different looks with it
and I'm glad that I finally filmed the
makeup tutorial using it for YouTube
like it's just gorgeous I use it so much
if you can get your hands on the 350 I
definitely suggest it morphy did just
come out with 350 shimmer and 350 maps
so separate palette with all the same
colors as 350 just wants all shimmer
once all matt i don't know if i'll
purchase them just because i'm not sure
i really need that in my life but if you
guys have ordered them and using their
bomb please leave in the comments below
and let me know if you think i need to
order it but just the OG
350 is awesome then my final favorite of
the month I've only had this for like a
week maybe but I was like should I wait
till next month to put it in my
favorites no because I'm literally have
been wearing it like every single day
since I got it I have to include it in
my favorites but it is the jaclyn hill
and becca cosmetics a champagne glow
face pellet believe is what the full
name of it is so this is what the inside
of it looks like it has a huge mirror
which is like super weird that can you
see my camera hello there it is but it
has a huge mirror inside but it has
three different blushes and then to
highlight shades the blushes are
beautiful i have amaretto on right now
and i just think this was a shade that I
wasn't excited for and I have worn it
nearly every single day it's such a
great neutral blush that I didn't
realize I was missing from my collection
like I have pinks I have peaches I have
a little bit of like shimmers in there I
do not have like a neutral blush and I
have just been using it so much also the
rose a spritz which is like the luminous
blush is just amazing on its own as a
blush topper I like to put it over
amourette oh it's so gorgeous I haven't
tried out the coral blush a lot yet
because of justin soaps house with
amaretto but I'm sure it's beautiful as
well the two highlighters one a
champagne pop which has already been
released for about a year but the other
one is Prosecco pop I have it on my
cheeks right now such a gorgeous gold
it's insane it's the only highlighter
I've been wearing since i got this
palette in the mail so that tells you
how much i love it i do have a full
video going over a full review of it
showing all the swatches of it and doing
a demo of several of the shades on my
face so if you want to check that out i
will leave it linked below but oh man
i'm obsessed with this palette alright
so i think that's the first time I've
ever had stopped filming and like go
somewhere and then come back had to go
to a doctor's appointment and I start
filming too late of course now that I've
gotten back and I want to tell you about
my fail it has heard thunder storms so
my lighting is probably looking right
now I apologize but I didn't want to
talk to you guys about this fail because
I was actually going to talk about last
month and then I just had too many
favorites like between the Sephora VIII
IV sale my birthday like I decide
too much going on so I thought I'd wait
and let you guys know and I thought
about skipping it again today but I was
like no I really want to tell you guys a
story if you guys follow me on snapchat
which he should I hold it there but
basically was about two months ago I
started noticing that my lips just
constantly hurt they constantly felt
dried out they constantly felt chapped
like if I looked closely at them in the
mirror I don't know a better word to
describe it but then like puckered like
they were like tight like it was the
weirdest thing it hurts so bad I started
to get sores on them I was like breaking
out on my lips and really once the
breakout started I was like something's
wrong here like what what's happening
because at first when they just felt
like dried and chapped I was like oh I'm
using too many liquid lipsticks I'm not
moisturizing my lips enough you know
maybe I need to keep using more lip
liners with liquid lipsticks like you
know you know obviously it's a problem
that I'm doing something wrong so then
the breakout started happening on my
lips which is super super painful I was
getting blisters like right in the
middle of my lip do they win one night
my husband went to kiss me and I was
like please don't my lips hurt so bad
like I know I can't and I was like okay
something is going on so I started to
examine the products that I've been
using and all of the lip products and
the only thing that I had changed was I
started to use this like EOS lip balm it
looks like this it's like in a little
egg guy and then when you open it up it
looks like this I received this as a
gift and you can see how much I used
like it's almost gone it was like big
before I received it as a gift and I
always have a lip gloss next my computer
and I always have a lip gloss in my
bathroom I always have a lip gloss in my
purse because I'm constantly trying to
like moisturize and keep my lips
hydrated because I wear lipsticks and
liquid lipstick so much so this was the
one that was in my bathroom which meant
every morning after I was washing my
face I was applying this every night
when after i wash my face i applied that
if i get out of the shower i applied
this i was constantly using it and it
did huge damage to my lips and once I
figured out that this was probably it I
started doing research on this and oh my
word there are so many cases out there
of people who have had like blisters
forming on their lips and other sores on
their lips because of using this eos
bomb I said something on my Facebook
page like has anyone else experienced
this and so many people wrote back I was
like the same thing happened to me the
same thing happened to me I stopped
using this immediately after I looked it
up and saw how many issues people were
having I immediately stopped within five
days my lips are completely healed
completely healed back to normal Norma
breakouts no more blisters no more dry
chapped feeling my lips are 100-percent
back to normal after I stopped using the
EOS which showed me that is exactly what
was causing the issue with my lips it
was crazy now some people I've also said
this is what they use every day they
have no problems with it they love a but
for me this did not work I've never come
across something like this that hurt me
so bad and literally like my lips were
starting to look deformed like seriously
it was so freaking bizarre so I have
stopped using the EOS I'm gonna throw
this the way I've been holding on to it
cuz I wanted to tell you guys my story
and show you guys that I'm throwing it
away because it just it was insanity so
that was a huge mega fail for me to show
you guys my story so that was my big old
fail thanks for listening it's and that
is gonna be everything for my may
favorites and my one big ol mega fail in
there as well I hope you guys enjoy this
video and some of the products that I
loved on if you have any of the same
products that you love that I've been
loving leave them in the comments below
