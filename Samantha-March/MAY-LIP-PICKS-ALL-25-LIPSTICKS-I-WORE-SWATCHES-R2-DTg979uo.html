today's video is going to be my picks
for the month of May if you're new to my
lip pick videos these were inspired by
drea CN I will have her channel listed
down below but basically what I do is I
share every single lipstick choice that
I made for my youtube videos throughout
the month because I am a daily youtube
uploader I typically have a quite a few
lip picks to share with you guys and for
the month of May I posted two 28 videos
but three of them were declutter switch
I was not on camera for so I have 25
days of lip products to share with you I
do a swatch on my hand and I also insert
a photo of me wearing that lipstick so
you can see what it looked like on me
I'm always really excited to do these so
let me go ahead and get started so the
first video that I posted in May was a
products on my someday maybe wishlist
and I wore a Mac combination in there I
wore Mac velvet teddy and then also the
gloss in under the sheets velvet hoodie
is a gorgeous kind of like nude pink
lipstick I think it is so pretty it's
definitely one of my favorites and then
under the sheets you are gonna see this
gloss mentioned quite quite a bit in
this video I was just talking about this
one in the products that I wear the most
off-camera and clearly for the month of
May I want you guys to know that I
really enjoyed this class because it's
gonna come up multiple times but it is
just a beautiful gloss it's one of my
favorites and I'm not even a big
lipgloss girl but there is the
combination there with velvet teddy and
then also under the sheets you can just
see that sheen in there it is such a
beautiful gloss I think it's gorgeous
okay so on the second I posted a will I
buy it video and I wore lawless Beauty
George the lawless Beauty liquid
lipsticks like really took me by storm
at once I started trying them out and
I'm just so impressed with these I feel
like I mentioned them so often George is
one of my absolute favorite nude shades
though like this color is so stunning
and I absolutely love wearing it I love
how long wearing these lipsticks are I
love how they feel on the lips they're
super comfortable and George is a
favorite nude ok on the 3rd
I posted a make up monthly and I wore
BAE from covergirl this is part of their
Queen collection in major shade and for
this one I just wanted something kind of
bright and fun with the makeup look that
I had on that day and I saw this one
from BAE and I really do like this
formula from covergirl and I saw it was
just kind of like a bright coral color
and I thought it was really pretty so I
decided to go with that one I wasn't
really sure I had like a blue glitter
look going on that day I was like I
don't know if this is gonna work out
well but I actually really like the
parent and a lot of people compliment it
as well and I was like oh goodness thank
you I don't have the best artistic mind
when putting like what lipstick should i
pair with this I like it's mostly nude
that's usually what you get and so I
really do like that color on the fourth
I posted a flashback favorites video and
I wore this little guy here this is from
Marc Jacobs it's in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
it is one of the Lamarck lip cremes
these are some of my favorite lipsticks
I really really like these this color is
so stunning there's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
super comfortable formula very creamy
yet very long wearing even after some of
the shine kind of fades away throughout
the day that pigment just stays on your
lips the color stays on your lips and it
it just it's so pretty these are so
crazy though that's why I have a lot of
minis I get them in a lot of sets and
such the next video that I post it was
my Sephora vib sale haul a follow up
video and I wore a combo in there I wore
lawless Beauty in Cameron and then I
wore the Urban Decay gloss in backtalk
so again I mean I really enjoyed the
lawless Beauty lipsticks been talking
about them a lot Cameron is one that I
did pick up in the vib sale and it just
kind of caught me off guard how light it
was I like to either wear it with a lip
liner or to put a gloss on it because it
is pretty super light light pink on me
so the gloss that I paired it with that
day was the Urban Decay backtalk I
really do like these urban decay glosses
they're pricey little buggers but I do
like the glossa formula so there is what
backtalk looks like and you can see it's
pretty darn pigmented for a gloss they
have a quite a range of the different
glosses there and
Chuck is definitely one of my favorites
okay so next I posted a lipgloss
declutter video actually I got rid of
over 50% I think it was of my glass
collection I was pretty proud of that
okay but then the next one that I have
to share here is my youtube didn't make
me buy it video talking about untyped
makeup products that I bought and I used
the milk lipstick and cream these are
just called their lip colors I think it
is this shade is just one of my all-time
favorites whenever I wear this one I
just I love it I take it in my clutch
with me a lot I take it traveling with
me a lot it's a beautiful lip color and
I feel like I've talked about it a lot
on my channel and I've worn it a lot it
is one of those lip shades that truly is
your lips but better and it doesn't go
anywhere I mean I have warned this
through tailgating I've worn this
through like morning tonight with very
little touch-ups it's such a pretty lip
color and it's one of my favorites okay
so then next up the next video that I
posted it was a wilayat video and I wore
a combo in that video as well I wore the
Urban Decay no I wore the bite Beauty in
honeycomb and then the Urban Decay gloss
in rapture Beauty honeycomb is such a
nice nude I really like this one as well
I have a little mini guide too because
it came in a set but it is truly one of
my favorite nudes and it just feels
really nice on the lips and then I did
pair it with a lip gloss this one is in
rapture from Urban Decay and again this
one is pretty light but I felt like it
paired really well over the honeycomb so
if you can see that one okay so that one
is the urban decay rapture again a nice
lip gloss formula and I thought that
pairing would work well and then the
next day I posted my lip pics video and
I wore oh yeah a purple lipstick good
this is in NYX this is one of their at
liquid suede in sway and I just wanted
to like do something different that day
you know I was posting my lip pics video
I thought let's get a little crazy here
because it's not often you see me in a
non nude or brown or pink lipstick but
you really don't see me in this kind of
like hot purple hot violet neon purple a
whole lot I always get a little bit
nervous
when I wear colors like these because
some people can be very extreme in their
comments but you know I mean look at
that array of newts and then blah BAM
how do you miss that one I have fun
wearing it I like to pair it with pretty
simple I looks because I've like if my
Ilyich is too much then that that's when
I don't want to do like too much with
the lipstick and I felt like it worked
for Olympics video I felt like you
worked so next up I posted a first
impression at a Friday video I didn't
have a new look color in there so after
I got done filming everything that I was
trying out I just added a bit of my
fenty gloss balm and to finish off the
look just so I had a little something on
my lips
I like the fenty gloss balm but it's not
really my favorite like I like the Mac
more I would like that Urban Decay more
than these and even like my Marc Jacobs
I still like better than this one but I
mean I like it it's it's a nice gloss it
doesn't do as much as I would like for
my lips and you know if you look at that
video it really just looks like I have
glossy lips which I don't mind but I
like glosses that just do a little bit
more if I'm gonna wear them just as a
gloss like the Urban Decay glosses a lot
of them I can wear just on their own and
it's enough color while still being
glossy I mean we all have our different
preferences but that's kind of mine it
does have a little bit of sparkle into
it but it's kind of hard to see like
once you actually put it on your lips I
don't notice it a ton but it smells good
and it's still nice okay so next up I
posted my YouTube introduced me to video
and I filmed that after I got done
filming my first impressions because I
do upload almost every single day it
means I film almost every single day as
well sometimes I post two videos in one
day like a lot I filmed for both of my
will I buy it just before I'm filming
this video I added a little bit of
flashes I changed my lip color I changed
my shirt and now I'm filming again so I
do that a lot or if I'm filming
something like it get ready with me or
her first impressions I get ready on
camera and then I just take that same
makeup look and I film again so all I
did when I was filming the next video
was I added a little bit of this MAC
lipstick and stripped and then I just
tapped that with the Fenty gloss balm
that I already had on Mac stripped is a
very very very nude lipstick I can't
really wear this one on its own I
to where it was some sort of gloss
because otherwise it's just too nude but
sometimes I kind of like that and that's
why I keep stripped around because it's
so light but it kind of helps if you put
a gloss over it it just gives you like a
juicy yet like natural looking lip and I
like it's not too much it's it's a
combination that I really do like next
up I was talking about indie brands and
giving some reviews and I wore this one
by pixi by petra it's in a pastel pedal
this is one of my favorite liquid
lipsticks as well I love this color and
I also really really like the formula I
think pixie did a really good job with
these liquid lipsticks and I swear I
feel like it's been mentioned almost
every single month in my lip pics video
but I really do like it it's so long
wearing and it looks super flattering on
the lips like it's a really flattering
nude on me so I really like this one in
pastel petal and then next up I posted
about makeup that I regret buying and I
wore my Mac age sex location one of my
favorite news how many times have you
heard me say that in this video but I
really really really like this nude
lipstick I think it's gorgeous and it's
in my clutch quite a bit it's a little
bit of a darker nude but again I think
it's really flattering on the lips it's
a matte lipstick from Mac and they're
matte lipstick formula I really really
do like I still feel like they're creamy
going on but they dry down it's not even
like they're too matte I mean they
definitely dry it on matte but it's not
not uncomfortable a lot of matte bullit
lipsticks I actually don't enjoy but
Mac's are some of my favorite okay and
then moving on on the 16th I posted a
wilayat video and I did a liner and
lipstick combo which I don't do a ton
but I kind of been doing a little bit
more lately so that's fun but I bored
the colour-pop Lumiere lippy what are
they sort of they call these again lip
liners but lippy lippy pencil there we
go Looby pencil and then I wore Urban
Decay a stark naked so I'm I don't
really know what my reasoning was for
that like I said I don't do it a ton but
there is what the colour-pop Lumiere
pencil looks like I think it's a really
stunning color and I've actually been
reaching for those more and lining and
filling in my lips
then I just topped it with a little bit
of the Urban Decay stark-naked and I
felt like it made a really pretty combo
like these two together I don't feel
like you would be like oh yeah they go
together but I felt like the end result
worked out really well and I actually
quite liked it so I you know try new
things trying new things and then on the
17th I posted an empties video and I
wore another Mac combo this is the one
that I was just talking about and the
makeup products that I wear the most
off-camera it is honey love and then
again under the sheet said you're gonna
see that one a lot
this really is one of my favorite lip
combos and ones that I wear so much
I do like honey love on its own and I
don't think you like it's not one of
those like strip like I need to put a
lip gloss over it but I think it just
looks super flattering when I put a bit
of under the sheets on top it's like it
makes my lips fuller I don't know really
how to take a comment like someone
commented in that video and said it said
no offense but your top lip looks fuller
and I was like okay like I wasn't sure
what was offensive about that or if I
don't know if they were trying to say
like you did a bad job over lining I
really didn't it's just this lip combo I
sweat I don't know what it is about it
but it does make my lips look bigger and
crazy but I was like thanks like I
didn't know what they were trying to
like insinuate like maybe I had like lip
fillers and they were like no offense
but looks like you got work done and I'm
like no it's just just my lip combo
that's it so it's one of my favorites
one that I wear it quite a bit so again
that is honey love and then the under
the sheets gloss alrighty so then that
next video that I posted was when I was
trying out new makeup and that's
actually the lip combo was that what it
was yeah trying new makeup that was the
lip combo that I decided to wear in the
video so again I got done you know
trying out all this new makeup and then
I went and filmed my empties video so
the next time at that I posted was the
collective haul and I wore a color pop
combination in there so I wore beeper
which is an ultra matte lipstick and
then also point 0 which I can't remember
if it's an ultra matte or an ultra satin
and it's pretty much completely wore off
beeper is one of like my oh geez this is
a newer one to me but I've gone through
an entire thing of beeper because it was
one like when it came out like everybody
wanted beeper it was such a coveted and
very worn lipstick across YouTube I'm
I put it on and I was like like it
looked like it just pulled darker up me
and colour-pop has that formula that I
feel like changes very quickly like you
know the formulas go bad or the colors
truly change because I bore this not
that long ago and I was like I do not
remember Beiber being that dark on me
but there's a swatch of it I mean I know
it's pulling as a darker nude in the
spot but on my lips I was like this is
this is dark I wasn't expecting to go
this dark so I grabbed out point zero
and I kind of put it you know in the
middle of my lips just to try to lighten
the look up but it was still a pretty
dark lipstick look which was fine it
just maybe wasn't necessarily what I was
expecting and point 0 isn't like super
super light but I thought if I use like
too light of a nude the contrast would
be too weird so there is the combination
of beeper and then point zero point zero
was a part of the Kathleen the lights
collaboration but I do like both the
colors it just it was one of those weird
things for it like it didn't turn out as
I was expecting it to turn out kind of
thing okay so then in the next video
that I post it on the 20th I posted my
lipstick dupe videos my color dupes
video and I wore in there at the Too
Faced it's one of their melted matte
lipsticks and it's in Queen B I really
enjoyed this shade it's just a really
nice mouth but it's kind of like cool
toned at the same time and I just think
it's a fun lipstick shade and I do like
this formula as well but I think this is
the only one that I have from Too Faced
and it came in like a lipstick set but
that is the Too Faced queen beat and I'd
quite enjoy that one the next day I
posted a declutter this was my I did
like a three-part declutter with primers
setting powders and one other thing all
my setting sprays so I wasn't on camera
but then the next day I posted makeup
that I felt like I got my money's worth
out of and I wore Queen B because I had
just been filming and then all I did is
I went and put in Urban Decay gloss over
it again that's well that's what I do a
lot when I'm filming twice a day so I
have decided to pair with the Urban
Decay backtalk because Mac talk is more
of a mob as well so I thought it would
match well with the queen bee so there's
the combination of Too Faced queen bee
and the urban decay back top gloss so
next up on the 23rd
we'll invite video and I wore stone from
dose of colors one of my all-time
favorite lipstick colors I just I love
this one the dose of colors look what
look liquid lipstick a formula is one of
my favorites it's crazy long-lasting and
it feels nice and comfortable on the
lips and stone is just a beautiful it's
like it's like a nude pink mauve more
nude pink more pink pink nude mob it's
stone from dose of colors like it had a
crazy hype around it and that's why I
bought it so that one is a stone the
next day I posted my minis wishlist and
something happened I wore the new
lipstick that I just picked up in my
Beauty lush order this is from Charlotte
Tilbury it's in the shade Kim kW and I
didn't like it and I was filming that
makeup look for an Instagram tutorial
I'll go ahead and leave it down below
and I had never tried out this lipstick
I just got it and I was super excited to
try it and when I put it on I like the
color just fine it's very nude but it's
one of those lipsticks that like I don't
know how to explain it but it doesn't
adhere to my lips like you can see my
lips and especially like in the center
part of my lips it's like there's the
lipstick lipstick won't stay there
there's a there's a few formulas that do
that for me but I was pretty sad that
this one is doing it for me I haven't
tried it again because I'm scared of it
now but I know I need to just to make
sure
maybe my lips for happen an off day that
day I don't know but I feel like I hear
a lot of people talk about this lipstick
from Charlotte Tilbury so I'm like no
and it was 34 dollars that's expensive
okay so it's super super light but again
I don't mind super super light nude
shades if they you know if I can top
them with a gloss it felt really creamy
as well but it was just I don't know it
was so weird and you can see it like you
can tell in the Instagram video what's
going on and someone even commented
because I I was like I can't wear this
lipstick by itself so I grabbed out my
sugar sugar gloss and I put the gloss
over it and someone wrote like oh I
don't think the gloss works with the
lipstick or some I don't remember what
it was that they said and I was like
the lipstick didn't work at all and I
was trying to save it by putting a lip
gloss over it that's what happens so I
don't know what have you guys tried
those lipsticks have you tried Kym kW
maybe it is a color thing maybe the
color is too light but it's just I've
had other formulas like that before
where it just doesn't it's just not mmm
you know but there is the combo that I
tried to do so the Kim kW and then the
Marc Jacobs a sugar sugar gloss I'll try
it again
but first impressions it didn't really
look great on me which is disappointing
okay so then the next day is when I
posted my get ready with me and it was
all about my new book release which I
was so excited about so I wore a combo
in there with the Urban Decay Naked
lipstick again I love the urban decay
formula this one is just a really really
light pink and because my look was
really like pink and sparkly and we were
celebrating my book release I put a
little bit of a lip topper from as you
way over it I just got this one pretty
recently it's just a little mini and
this is in San Tropez so I thought it
would just make a really fun celebratory
lip color duo type thing so that is the
Urban Decay Naked and then the San
Tropez lip topper from ziwei if you
haven't seen that video yet make sure to
check it out there is a giveaway in
there and it's still happening now but
we are almost finished with the next
video that I posted after that was
makeup that I didn't get my money's
worth out of and I filmed it after they
get ready with me so I had on and naked
and then the same Tropez lip topper once
again the next video that I posted it
was the spill the tea mini tag video and
I wore in there at the Sigma Beauty
lipstick liquid lipstick in foxglove
this is one of my favorite colors
especially for warm weather months it is
just such a fun color and I really like
Sigma beauty's liquid lipstick formula
as well again very long-lasting but I
love this kind of hot
kind of like berry pink I think it's
such a cool color so I really do like
that one the next video I post it was my
makeup brush tip clutter so I wasn't on
camera but then the next one after that
was a will I buy a video and I wore in
there the NARS Ana again this one is
really pretty mob as well I've been
brilliant Moss lately also so this one
here from NARS in Ana I think this is a
very beloved lipstick as well a lot of
people say really good things about it I
think it's beautiful and I really do
like that formula it is the let me say
quickly the audacious formula so and
then the last video that I posted it was
my make up monthly and I wore NYX as San
Paulo
I love San Paulo I love that I kind of
ended the month with a couple of bright
colors and here as well San Paulo is a
really beautiful just kind of bright
bright pink color and I got always a lot
of nice compliments on that one as well
so kind of fun to see how we ended the
month these a little bit of bread or
shades but after that guys that is going
to do it for my lip picks up for the
month of May okay so that is everything
for today's video I hope that you
enjoyed seeing all of the lipsticks of
that I chose to wear in my youtube
