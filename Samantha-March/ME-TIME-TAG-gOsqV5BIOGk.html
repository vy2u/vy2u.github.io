video is going to be another tag video
and this is the me time tag and I got
tagged for this probably like three or
four weeks ago and I forgot to save the
email that tells me who tagged me in the
video and I tried looking and I just I
can't remember and I couldn't find who
tagged me so I'm so sorry but I'm
excited that I got the tag because it's
really fun and it'll probably just be
you know a way to to get to know me a
little bit better and all that fun stuff
so I love that I got time for this and I
will be tagging a few of you as well
which should be in the description box
below along with all the questions that
I'm going to answer so if you would like
to see the me time tag please my
packages of what you read or watch
during me time and to be honest I don't
really get to read for fun every book
that I read is either something i'm
reviewing for chocolate plus it's a
marching inquiry I'm proofreading things
like that so I don't really get to read
for fun unless something is on my review
schedule or anything like that those are
really only the books that i read and i
don't really like saying that I don't
get to read for fun because I think
reading is fun anyways and it's amazing
that as part of my job so I can't really
complain but just because my schedule is
always so busy I don't get to pick books
outside of my review scheduled to read I
also don't really watch a lot of TV I do
watch a lot of sports we're in baseball
season so I'm watching a lot of the
chicago cubs games during football
season I really watch I mean Sunday's is
just that's all we're doing is watching
football but I'm at Green Bay Packer fan
so i watch all the packer games the DVR
I know that I DVR like total divas on E
cuz i absolutely love that show I think
it's awesome but I haven't I know a new
season just started like weeks ago and I
started to DVR haven't watched any of
them yet because I just haven't had the
time it's been like to watch HGTV I
think we own a home and I think we just
like to get different ideas and design
ideas and all that fun stuff from the
show so we watch like property brothers
there's one with like
a married couple I think his name is
chip I can't remember her name right now
but we watched that one a lot that one's
fun so yeah other one is what do you
wear during me time um well I work from
home I'm self-employed I I work from
home so I don't know if I would consider
that me time or work time but basically
I wear like workout clothes I wear yoga
pants sweatpants I'm usually in some
sort of like Fitness tank top or t-shirt
I usually tend to throw on like
sometimes a nicer shirt and I filmed
these videos but a lot of times i'm in
my workout shirts but yeah that's
basically i'm pretty casual when i'm at
home chillin by myself with my dog she
doesn't judge what I where she hasn't
judged next one is what are your me time
of beauty products and let's see
actually when my husband is gone like if
he's gone for a few days or nights or
something I'm by myself that's when I
tend to do like the crazy masks because
otherwise I just don't want to wear them
when what at night when we're sleeping
together but I like to do certain masks
you know sometimes they're green
sometimes their blog sometimes they're
blue but usually when i'm home alone by
myself i tend to do like the overnight
masks and things like that other me time
beauty products i also i don't wear a
whole lot of makeup unless i'm going
somewhere during the day but at home I
tend to wear a lot of like lip gloss or
really obsessed with the perfectly posh
sugar scrub the OPG scrub for my lips
I'm always putting that one on I enjoy
that sometimes when my husband's gone to
like he thinks he knows when i record
youtube videos because i actually put
makeup on for it and because the lights
are so bright you tend to have to put
more makeup on or else you just like
look super washed out in the videos so
he always knows when i'm recording but
sometimes when he's gone I wear like
heavier makeup or a darker makeup or
like darker lips because he isn't a
total fan of that look like the more
dramatic look so sometimes when he's
gone and like yeah I'm really gonna go
hard so yeah the next one is what is my
current favorite nail pal
and that's a tough why don't bossa nova
me around from the OPI line is like one
of my favorites it's this really pretty
like great almost like a pinkish gray
color and I really really love that one
there's also a blue I think it's called
set sail in the sally hansen line that i
absolutely love in leaf in lilac is
another one in coral reef from sally
hansen those are the ones that i really
really love from that line do you eat or
drink during me time this one is kind of
funny because whenever i know again if
like my husband's gone or like he's
gonna be at a sports thing he plays a
lot of ball and bowling and things like
that and i know i'll be on dinner on my
own i tend to get things that I know he
doesn't like because I'm like hey I'm
just by myself like I don't have to
worry about him there's a certain
restaurant in town that I absolutely
love love love their chicken nachos and
he just like never can really find
anything at that restaurant to eat so a
lot of times when I know I don't have to
worry about him too I tend to go and get
the nachos or drink I don't know a drink
I probably wouldn't really have anything
special during me time I drink a ton of
water during the day the tumblr that you
saw me have i fill that up I mean it's
not a very large tumblr it's not like it
holds a ton of liquid so I probably fill
it up like 10 times a day with water so
I'm always trying to drink as much water
as i can I don't really keep anything
special in the house sometimes I have
like Gatorade in the fridge but that's
about it so by eating yeah i'd say i do
my restaurants that he doesn't like he
also doesn't really like McDonald's and
I love McDonald's so I tend to get a lot
of mcdonalds if he's gone current
favorite candle I really don't think i
have 1 i'm not a huge candle person
sometimes if i really want a candle
around the house I'll do like the
diamond candles I don't know if you guys
have heard of them but they're just a
regular candle but they have a ring
inside of it and the ring can be
anywhere from like ten dollars to five
thousand dollars or something like that
I don't know I haven't ordered one in a
super long time but one time I did get a
100-dollar ring out
and it's actually a ready really pretty
ring so sometimes when I like go out on
like the water or river or to a water
park or things like that I don't like to
wear my actual wedding ring for fear of
losing it but I still like to wear a
ring and I would always just were like
an old ring that my husband gave me and
now I wear this ring that i got from die
mechanics i think is pretty and that we
don't really like candles at all around
the house i would say the sense i'm
attracted to or more like citrusy or
clean our fresh vs like a pumpkin or
cinnamon or things like that i'm not
really not really into that ever have
outdoor me time um because i work from
home and i also do have a pretty high
energy vizsla puppy we go on walks every
day we walk on average about three miles
a day and I like this time I either use
it to like call my mom I'll usually call
her in the mornings a couple days a week
just to see what's going on because we
live in different states but I also
recently have started getting into audio
books so I listened to the audio books
on our walks together and I really enjoy
that time I like being outside I like
getting her exercise so it kind of wears
her out so it makes my days easier and
yeah out in the sunshine feels good but
I ever go to a movie alone I don't know
honestly I've never have been to a movie
alone I really don't think i would
mostly because i don't really go see
movies I mean I went and saw Magic Mike
XXL with my best friend because why
won't my but I can't remember the movie
that I saw before then like weed i just
don't really go to movies a lot it's
like what is it now to get into movie
like ten dollars to get into a movie
like no I'm not a big movie person
anyways I don't watch a lot of movies we
don't I don't as Netflix what you watch
movies on we don't have that we don't
have any sort of we don't have HBO I
mean we just don't really watch movies a
lot so honestly I probably wouldn't
because I'd want movie time to be like
also a social time with friends and kind
of killed two birds with one stone so I
feel like I'd probably just feel like
wasting my time
if I went to movie by myself favorite
online shop I mean I don't know when I
shop on amazon quite a bit I shop on
sephora a lot that's not an only online
store um I don't really tend to shop
online and lad I do like shutterfly I
like shutterfly I've ordered from
shutterfly before we've ordered like
pillows and cards I think we did our
Christmas cards with shutterfly and
things like that so maybe shutterfly
let's go shutterfly this one says is
there anything else you want to add or
anything you else at anything else you
do in your me time as they probably not
I don't feel like I have a lot of me
time even though I work from home and
I'm home every single day that is you
know my work time I'm working and I work
a lot of nights as well I really I don't
think I really have anything else to add
that's just a little bit of my me time
when I can get it I don't get a whole
lot of it but when I do I think it is
important to have make sure I do some
things like even if it's just getting my
hair done every couple months or I
probably get like a massage twice a year
type of thing but I think it is
important to have the meantime into kind
of recharge and relax and reset and all
that good stuff I think it's important
so you don't get burned out especially
if you are someone who is self-employed
because since you make your own hours
sometimes it's hard to turn that off so
you need to be able to have your me time
to just chill out and relax and all that
good so that was the me time tag that
wasn't too bad I hadn't looked at the
questions before I entered this video
and I probably could have like grabbed
out a few things like the nail polishes
and things like that but I didn't read
ahead of time so I wasn't sure what I
was going to be answering but I hope you
