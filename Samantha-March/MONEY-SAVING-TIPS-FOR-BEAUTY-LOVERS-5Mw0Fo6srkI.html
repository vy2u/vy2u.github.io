today's video I'm going to be showing
like money saving tips and tricks for
beauty lovers so this is going to be a
way to either find products for cheaper
get money off products products for free
because we all love that and even how to
like get gift cards of places just I've
been kind of keeping a list for the past
few months of what i find the best for
money-saving tips and tricks i can
eventually share a video for it i'm sure
i'm missing like so many different
things but hopefully this gives you a
good like starting idea of how we can
save that money you guys follow me on
snapchat you know that i love that song
by lil dicky thank you so much so if you
would like to see some of my favorite
tips and tricks to save money on beauty
and makeup products please keep watching
about is joining reward programs now the
two that I'm going to talk about
specifically for this are sephora and
alta of course to of like our favorite
place those on earth am i right am i
right so both places have reward
programs for sephora it's called the vib
programs most important thing this is
free to sign up so for sephora you would
sign up as a vib and anyone can be a
beauty insider that's kind of where you
start off on and then they have
different tiers so you would sign up you
would get like a card or I don't even
think I actually have a card but I just
have like a number I do most of my
shopping online so just linked right in
my Sephora count is my number every time
that you make a purchase you get points
usually it's like one point for every
dollar spent sickly you will get a point
for every single purchase that you make
then those points are kept in like a
bank and you can redeem your points for
products more points you have like the
better products you can get they have
100 point perks I think they have like
250 Point parks and then 500-point perks
I currently am at like six hundred
points right now and super excited
because usually the 500-point parks are
like super bomb so I'm just waiting for
that like super bomb set product to come
out so I can cash in my points but in
the meantime every time I purchased from
Sephora I'm just gaining more and more
points and also with Sephora if you
spend a
certain amount of money within a
calendar year you can get pump bumped up
to a VIP member a very important beauty
insider and then you just have a little
bit more perks with this sometimes the
VIP members can get certain products
first from Sephora you get better point
perks you get butter like discounts
things like that and then also if you
spend a certain amount of money in a
calendar year you can be a vib rouge
remember which is like the top of the
top at sephora i myself am only a VIP
member i don't know if i ever get to be
a vib rouge should I be excited or
should it be worried should my bank
account be worried maybe but vib rouge
you really get like a lot of the great
stuff I believe you get enrolled in
their flash program so you get free
two-day shipping on everything be
invited to like special events sometimes
Sephora will hold like vib rouge only
events where you can go and shop early
with only other vib rouge members the
hands-on items that first came on the
market so this is a really great way to
get free products to get certain
discounts and like I said it is free so
you would definitely want to sign up
with that at sephora you can do it when
you make a purchase in-store or you can
do it online now alta has something very
similar to that they have the point
system but what's cool about Alta is
that you can actually redeem your points
for cash so instead of only being able
to spend it on certain products like
Sephora you can only you know these are
their 100-point perks you can pick this
is their 500-point berg you can pick at
Ulta you can save it up for money
cashton my points at Alta I don't shop
at Alta as much at typically shop at
sephora or if I want something like
drugstore friendly I usually go to my
CVS because they have better coupons but
I was making a purchase from Ulta and I
had some some points that were actually
going to expire soon I was like whatever
I might as well do it and i think i got
like fifteen dollars off my order and
that can be for anything at alta you can
do it on the drugstore side of things or
you can do it on higher-end side of
things it just automatically goes
towards your purchase they also have I
believe it's their platinum point perk
is there like higher tier and then you
get special benefits with that I am NOT
a point platinum point perk member but I
think you get like good good coupons and
discount
in the mail you might get something for
shipping things like that but once again
that is absolutely free to sign up to as
well and these are just crucial crucial
ways to get money off and to get free
products I would definitely recommend
joining the reward programs for Sephora
and alta and if there's any other store
that you guys shout back frequently see
if they have a rewards program because
they are a really good way to help save
that money so also when shopping online
I highly highly highly recommend the
website ebates I feel like probably
everybody talks about it on here but
seriously what I first started watching
YouTube videos I was not on ebates and
it took me probably like five videos to
be like why does everyone talk about
this ebays why does everyone recommend
it like it actually did take me a while
to get started with it we want to go to
that website first you would find the
store you want to shop at say you want
to shop at sephora you would click on
sephora and its really nice because
it'll tell you right there if so far is
having any sort of sales coupons
discounts things like that the ebates
website will tell you is how you kind of
get an idea if you don't already know
but you just click on sephora and it
would take you to the website like
normal but now you are linked to your
ebates account so when you check out
there's nothing else that you need to do
you would just put items in your basket
check out like normal and you would get
a certain cash back into your ebates
account which is amazing sephora a lot
of times we'll have a percent cash back
i try to purchase something every single
time sephora has a percent cash back
because eight percent cash back on your
Sephora order can really add up so any
time that you purchased from an online
store that is linked with ebates some
stores are not I just ordered from
anastacio Beverly Hills and
unfortunately they were never on ebay so
I was like but most stores are
Sephora also amazon is on there i think
nordstrom macy's I mean so many places
are on there so definitely I would check
out you Bates but then you just get
money built up in your ebates account
and I think it's like every three months
or every four months you get a check you
can either get a check in the mail or I
do it as a paypal deposit so they would
just send me all of the cash back that i
earned and it's amazing it's I I'm so
upset that I didn't like the moment that
I heard ebates and I was like oh you
know I don't
that and then I heard it again I was
like nice to don't think I need that
like that with myself how long it took
me to get signed up with ebates i will
leave a link below just so you know that
link is a referral link if you do sign
up with you Bates you will get like an
affiliate link as well and I think you
get like special bonuses for people use
your link to sign up so just so you know
that link would be an affiliate link if
you don't want to use my affiliate link
yeah hi you just go to ebay scom and
sign up but it's something that I
definitely recommend especially if you
do a lot of online shopping and I saw
that ebates just recently put out that
now you can get cashback when shopping
in stores I think you have to link like
your credit card or your bank account or
something to ebates and then when you
would shop in that store it would credit
you back I haven't checked it out yet I
am a little bit leery of like linking
credit cards and stuff because we never
really know what happens yet so I
haven't done it yet I need to do my
research a little bit more but that's
also another option that you could check
out with ebates like I said I like to do
most of my makeup shopping online not
only to Z bays to get cash back but also
because you can typically get a lot of
like free samples when purchasing online
and you can't really in stores so with
Sephora with every purchase that you
make you can pick out three free samples
and they have good samples like I
definitely love to get the samples and
then also with Sephora they usually have
some sort of like deluxe sample that you
can get as well you typically just need
to enter in a code at checkout so as
long as you're not using any sort of
other like coupon codes or anything you
can only use one code per check out at
Sephora but you can use with this deluxe
sample code and you can find it right on
the website they usually have something
like right on the left-hand side that
says like weekly specials and you can go
through them and you can get a deluxe I
stable so that's for free samples that
you're getting when you check out online
at Sephora vs if you're actually going
into the store so all this is a little
bit different you can pick out almost
like a package of samples i guess i
would say and i think they have like
makeup fragrance and like a surprise or
something like that i usually pick the
makeup line just to see but their
samples are usually pretty good as well
though i do like sephora a little bit
more but that's another reason
that I shop online because you can get
free samples I really really love and
this is a way to get free products you
guys probably know what I'm going to say
because I talk about them all the time
and I'm constantly doing unboxings but
it is the website influenster I signed
up with influence or probably over a
year ago and i have received so many
different box boxes from them and it is
amazing so basically with influenster
you do not need to be a beauty vlogger
or beauty blogger or anything like that
you just need to be someone who wants to
receive free products in exchange for
leaving reviews I do want to stress that
point because they're not just going to
send your free products and then you
just get them and you don't do anything
with them businesses really do thrive
off reviews and for you talking to other
people about it so really when you get
anything sent to you for free it is in
exchange for talking about them for
reviewing them for marketing for them
but basically with influenster you would
just go to their website sign up again I
will leave a link below it is another
referral link just so you know it's not
like a monetary link I just would get
more like social points because kind of
how they work is that you connect all
your different social medias and you get
like a higher rating based on like how
many different followers you have but
that's okay like that does not matter
you don't need to have a ton of
followers like I know people who really
only do you know Facebook and Twitter
and Instagram like as a casual thing
they're not any sort of like blogger or
reviewer or influencer and I just do it
for fun and they still get box boxes so
really anybody can but you would just a
link your social accounts and then you
would also take a little surveys I think
they're called snaps an influencer you
would answer questions because then
that's letting influence to see what
you're interested in and like kind of
like who you are because of course with
certain products there's a certain
demographic that that company is trying
to reach and if you fit that demographic
and that's a good thing every once in a
while you might get an email from
Influenster saying hey we think you're
good for an upcoming box box please take
the survey you would fill out the survey
and then send it back to influenster and
they decide you're a part of the
campaign you would get an email saying
hey you're in this campaign you would
get sent a box box filled with whatever
products it is that they want you to
review you would get a test
ow shared on your social media and then
of course review I have gotten like
foundation from Maybelline I have gotten
boxes filled with like deodorant shampoo
conditioner lashes most recently I
received the Marc Jacobs glow stick and
I was like wow there's so many different
things and it's not only for beauty like
they have it for fitness and just a
lifestyle as well like I know someone
who got a whole Keurig okay a Keurig
those are expensive I mean there's just
so many different boxes out there sports
so whatever it is that you're into I
with my suggest looking into influenster
and signing up I know sometimes people
can get frustrated in the beginning
because they're like I'm not I'm not
giving any box boxes like what am i
doing what am i doing wrong what should
I be doing my thing is just take as many
snaps as you can and also use the review
feature on influenster you can review
products right on influenster like you
would on like amazon so any time that
i'm reviewing a product and i leave my
review on amazon i will just copy and
paste it and put it right onto
influenster as well because they will
see that they will see what i'm
interested in and that I'm engaging on
their website and also they do have an
app i would suggest downloading the app
as well and then that way it's really
handy if you can actually like use the
barcode scanner in the app at the store
like if you if you see something at the
store and you're like hmm i wonder if
this is any good you can scan the
barcode with the influenster app and up
will pop all these reviews so that's
really handy I've used that feature
before and I really like it but
influencer is such a great way to get
free products have definitely check them
out if you haven't yet apps that I
really love to use and I want to share
some with you some are beauty related
but some are just like money related in
general but these are the apps that I
use all the time I can show them to my
phone if you want but one that I love
that I've been using for probably over a
year is called receipt hog basically
with a receipt hug you download the app
and then every time you make a purchase
you would just take a picture of your
receipt and you have to answer a
question like who shopped there they
want to know gender and they want to
know the star rating of your experience
and then
you get coins based on they have like a
rating system you know if it's like five
dollars and under I think you get like
five coins and if it's like twenty
dollars you're like 10 coins I don't
know but your coins add up and then
every so often you can cash out your
coins for paypal i use the paypal
feature so every couple of months i get
like thirty dollars or something it's
nothing that's like going to make you
super rich but you are gonna get
basically essentially like cash back
with every purchase that you make if you
take a picture of your receipt it's
super easy I've been doing it all the
time like at first it was a little hard
for me to remember to like ask your
receipts like a lot of time at gas
stations or like you want your receipt
it's like no like I'm just gonna lose it
and it's gonna clutter up my purse it
took me a little bit to be like oh yes
no I would like my receipt and take
pictures of it I've got a couple of my
friends doing it we all love a receipt
hug I can show it to you on my phone
nobody is sponsoring this video I'm just
telling you guys things that i love but
if you can see right here it has like a
little pig on it so if you click it
there you go that's what it looks like
once in a while certain stores like you
won't get coins but you can like spin
the slots and then you get coins for
that they have like different surveys
that you can take and you can get points
for that it's just a really cool easy
way to get cash back and i love using it
so of course mine will be linked below i
think it's a referral link but i'm not
positive and i'm not sure if I get
anything for a referral but it will be
linked below their app that I recently
got into is ibotta which is this one
right up here at the top this is what it
looks like but it does have like beauty
that has grocery pharmacy clothing beer
and wine beauty and wellness dining on
the go so basically it's kind of like
the same thing as a receipt hug and you
would just take pictures of your
receipts like say I was going to hyvee
which is my grocery store and I buy
these certain items I would then look in
the I gotta app and see if any of those
items are on there if they are I would
click unlock it and usually they have
you answer a question what's the highest
level of education you received what
state do you live in watch this 10
second video things like that so you
would do it you want to lock it you
would then take a picture of your
receipt and you would take a picture of
the barcode of the items that you bought
and if they might
jump then you get cash back into your
account and then of course you can get
at PayPal to you these have really good
cash back options especially on things
like beer and liquor which is expensive
I mean we can buy like a case of beer
and get four dollars off of it by using
the ibotta app and that's really good
same thing was dining like one of my
favorite restaurants was on there the
other day and it was you got five
dollars back if you die need at ruby
tuesday and i was like sammy etsy they
can get a but they have beauty and
lifestyle in there as well but again
it's just a great way to get cash back
so of course i will leak that linked
below as well the last app that i want
to talk about is the retail me not so
this one is right there on my phone and
basically you can open this one up and
it will give you different coupons they
do have like a search feature on top
that you can look for but like see altos
right there it says free gift with
purchase and you can scroll through and
see what coupons are there they have
food they have beauty they have
lifestyle stores i mean they have so
much so whenever I'm out in a store I'm
like oh hold on and you just check
retailmenot see if they have any coupons
and then you would just pull up the
coupon on your phone and then they would
scan it right at the register it's super
handy but these three apps are what I
really love to use for shopping and so I
will leave them all linked down below
another tip that I want to share with
you guys is joining newsletters for like
brands that you really love so of course
I get the newsletter from Sephora and I
get them from ulta as well so anytime
that they're having any sort of specials
you would get an email to you also i
think is really cool because they will
do like pop-up sales and it's only for
like a few hours at a time so you'll get
an email saying hey starting at two p.m.
today for four hours with any purchase
you can get like a four-piece laura
geller set or four piece you know
maybelline's that whatever it is they
will email you with those specials so
you would definitely want to get signed
up same thing with Sephora whenever they
have like new point perks come in or new
things on sale or new and beauty they
send out a newsletter and that is really
important and informational to get but I
also do this with certain brands that I
love like tart is one of them I know I'm
signed up for the Sigma newsletter color
pops newsletter is a really good one but
just whenever they're having a sale and
you
product lunch anything that they need to
tell their customers about they will
send you the email if you're on the
newsletter list recommend signing up for
like every brand in the world because
then your emacs inbox could be pretty
overwhelming but just for like your
favorite brands or companies that you
order from very frequently definitely
see if they have a newsletter so you can
get those and also a lot of times when
you sign up for the newsletter they have
something like I think color pops is
five dollars off your next order and
maybe tarts is like ten percent off your
next order you know you can get a
discount that way for signing up for the
newsletter so that of course comes in
handy another tip is to look for
affiliate codes so some Beauty vloggers
or influencers will have codes to
certain companies and you can get a
percentage off morphy is a big one for
this like so many of the big influencers
have a code with morphe so you can get
like ten percent off figma is another
one there is a lot of different
companies that will have ambassadors or
affiliates and they will have discount
codes so then you can use that discount
code and you get money off your order
that means that that influencer then
gets like a percentage of that sale but
hey you get a discount they make some
money the company's happen you because
you're ordering from them I mean it's
just like a win win win all around
actually if there's any youtubers are
influencers check their youtube
description box because a lot of times
all of our codes will be down there you
just want to check the description boxes
see maybe where they're affiliated with
check out the company's there's anything
that you want to order make sure you use
the discount code to save a little bit
of money talk about it is saving up for
sales so a lot of places will do sales
likes afford those they're vib sale I
believe they do this twice a year like
once in the fall and once in the spring
where they have a certain percentage off
sometimes it's ten percent I've also
seen fifteen percent usually it's a
little bit better for vib and vib rouge
members and you get to shop first before
like the beauty insiders but they they
let you know ahead of time when that
sales coming so you can prepare you can
get your cart ready it's like really
exciting no seriously it's like really
exciting it also does the 21 days of
beauty and I think that happens in the
spring i think it just happened like
this past April and I was actually late
to the game on it and I was a really
upset with myself and I can't wait for
the next also 21 days of beauty
basically they have either
a couple products or a couple brands and
each day they feature like three to four
different things that's either a
percentage of I shopped the day where
they had like twenty five percent off
the entire Mario Badescu line for one
day got like a tart mascara for half the
price like it's awesome I think that
only happens once and I think it's in
the spring but look at these bigger
events I don't shop at macy's a whole
lot but I'm seeing that there's like a
black friday in July Macy's event and
they're saying like Anastasio lines
fifty percent off i need to look into
this more but if that's true that's
really cool so just see if there's any
big sales coming up that you can be
saving your money for because usually
especially during like the Sephora vib
sale I save a lot of like the more
expensive hi higher-end products I save
it for one of the vib sales so I can get
some money off because that's usually
the only way that you can get discounts
at sephora they don't usually offer you
know it just discounts for whatever
reason and I think it's because their
point program is so good and their
samples are so good so they don't offer
those discounts a lot so I always save
up for the vib sale of course another
one is black friday i mean black friday
you know the biggest shopping holiday
ever and of course a cyber monday cyber
monday it actually excites me more than
Black Friday you still can get a lot of
good deals online on black friday but
this girl is not going out and black
friday crowd no thank you I'm scared
enough on crowds on a regular day as it
is I can't handle Black Friday but cyber
monday is basically very similar to
black friday but it's it's geared toward
the virtual world and so a lot of
vendors have really amazing online sales
so that's another one that you can save
up for be everything for my money saving
