morning routine so my day usually starts
off at about 6:30 a.m. and this is when
my first alarm goes off and I typically
will always hit the snooze button and go
back to sleep for a little bit then at
6:45 my alarm goes off again I check on
Aries this is just where she sleeps she
prefers to sleep under the covers and
usually right in between my husband and
I so we start to wake up and then some
days like this day I just want to go
back and sleep again
so I do until arias decides it is time
to get up she is the queen around here
she rules the roost she tells me when
it's time to get up I do try to check
social media in bed you know to start my
day off with my phone which I know is
awful but I think most of us do it so
that's just how it is then we get in a
few more morning cuddles some stretches
yawns try to wake up that usually means
some belly rubs for Aries yes there we
go and then it is finally time to get up
head into the bathroom for you know all
the regular bathroom stuff like brushing
my teeth putting my hair up washing my
face doing my regular skincare routine
all that good stuff I have gotten a so
few questions about the tattoo that's
behind my ear it is a breast cancer
ribbon I figure you can see it pretty
clearly here so that's what that is it's
in memory of my grandmother so after I
brush my teeth I head off to my skincare
this is what I'm currently using a
cleanser and then a moisturizer I'm not
sure how to pronounce the brand's name
but that's what I do spray on a little
deodorant so I don't scare myself during
the day and then it is time to head
downstairs first thing I do once we go
downstairs is to let areas outside of
course let her go to the bathroom I kind
of look at the weather we play around in
the yard for a little bit she usually
finds something to run after a bunny a
bird a rapper in the yard something and
then we head inside and this is my
office I know a lot of people are
requesting an office or like a room tour
so I try to give you just a little one
here but the
is what my office looks like this is
where I spend all of my time
that's areas little corner she's got her
cave in her bench and that's where she
does her thing but I will I just need to
clean you can probably tell it's not
very organized so I need to clean it
before I can do an office tour but this
is where I had to work and this is what
I basically do all morning I'm pretty
boring you guys it took me a while to
film this because I just sit at my desk
and work the majority of the morning so
this is what you see me doing I'm
looking over my calendar and my files
I do try to get some breakfast I love
these Special K protein shakes but the
day that I was filming I was really
hungry and so I had to go for some
cinnamon toast crunch and then it is
just back to work and answering emails
checking social media checking YouTube
you know all that good stuff and after
I'm done with that and I've left my
breakfast settle that's usually when I
will start to work out I share my
workouts with you guys every single day
on snapchat and I really love the app
cracker I also have a full fitness video
explaining how I workout and the tools
and equipment that I use sometimes my
workouts can go like this but most of
the time this is what they look like
Aries just is obsessed with me
when I workout I don't know what it is
but she prefers to lay on top of me sit
on top of me
she likes to really be a part of my
workouts like does any anybody else have
their dog that does this because it is
just hilarious she'll stand guard over
me like watch my form I don't know what
it is but I do workout every single
morning I do a lot of yoga like what I'm
doing here I just think it's such a
great stretch for the body sometimes I
do have to do it basically on top of
Aries because she'll just sit there and
she won't move I don't know what it is
but I always have to start the day off
with some yoga stretches too because I
just think it's a great way to wake up
the body and then we also you know of
course need some snuggles and I had to
include this next clip in here because
it was so weird I practiced my forearm
balance every single day something I'm
always working on and areas like spazzes
out at one point and hits my head and I
nearly fall over like watch what is that
why did she do that
I don't know but that's really scary
when you're upside down and only
balancing on your arms and then we have
to end each practice in shavasana or
corpse pose which for Aries means
belly rubs because she did such a
fantastic workout and then we are back
in the office we are back to work I
checked my phone I checked social media
I usually post on Instagram between like
9:30 and 10:00 o'clock each morning I
post my first post and if you guys
didn't know I am an author so right here
I'm working on my fifth book which
should be out before the end of the year
I'm also a book publisher and I do a lot
of book marketing so this is the time
where I'm also editing my YouTube videos
you'll see my Kindle on my desk right
there I'm constantly reading as well and
yeah that is mostly my morning always
answering email is always typing getting
ready for that fifth book to be released
before the end of the year I'm so
excited for that book to come out but
that is mainly at my morning routine I
hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll end
with one last clip of Miss Aries thanks
for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
