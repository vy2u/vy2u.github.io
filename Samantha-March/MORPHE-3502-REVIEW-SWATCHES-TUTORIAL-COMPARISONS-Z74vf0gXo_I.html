video is going to be all about the new
morphe 35o 2 palettes I'm going to be
showing you how I got this eye look I'm
going to be doing swatches of it
comparisons with the original 3/5 L and
also the Jaclyn hill palette from morphe
and of course giving my overall thoughts
and a review on the palette so we have a
ton to cover in today's video
so I'm gonna go ahead and get started so
first up this is the new morphe 35o 2
palette it is $23 it's available right
now on the morphe website I checked just
before filming it was still available it
will also be coming to uLTA Beauty which
is very interesting morphe it's now
going to be sold at Ulta looks like a
lot of the items will be available
starting October 22nd and then in I
don't know if it's every store but it
will be starting in stores on October
27th so just real quick to touch on how
I got this palette because it's a little
bit of an interesting story it released
on Thursday the 12th and I did order it
about 15 minutes after it went for sale
I placed my order I purchased this
palette and I purchased a whole bunch of
other things because I was trying to
reach the $75 for free shipping we all
know I need free shipping in my life
even if that means it ordering a bunch
of other things instead of just a $23
palette but that's how I live my life
and about 40 minutes later I want to say
my doorbell rang and it was the morphe
35o palette I made a joke on my snapchat
that morphe has one hour shipping to
Iowa of course I was just kidding this
was sent to me in PR so that was really
interesting to me I didn't know what was
coming
I have received a PR from a morphe in
the past I had seen a bunch of
influencers getting this palette the
week before I didn't get mine and I
thought that's fine some companies do
send you everything some companies send
you things from time to time it doesn't
really bother me I know I'm a smaller
influencer so I never expected to get
any sort of packages and I just figured
when I start bringing it in PR and I
wasn't I was just gonna go ahead and buy
it on Thursday look normal which is what
I did and then they showed up
I am very and thankful for this because
it allowed me to play with it the entire
weekend and to get my review video up
just a little bit quicker than I
would've if I you know were to still be
waiting on my order from morphe so I did
want to say that
that I did receive this in PR but I had
ordered it because it came so quickly
after I had placed my order I was able
to cancel my original order with Murphy
which was nice because I guess I ordered
a lot of stuff that I probably didn't
need five dollar mark but I did want to
be upfront about that I'm not affiliated
with Murphy I don't have a code or
anything like that I just do
occasionally receive care packages from
them which is really really nice so to
move on Murphy has recently rebranded so
you can see the logo here looks a little
bit different from the logo on the
original 3 500 palette I did purchase
the 3 5 Oh a while back I've had this
palette for quite some time I could also
tell it's still like the you know
regular black plastic packaging like
some of the older palettes but it's
almost like it's like it's it's thicker
I don't know if that makes sense but I
could tell it has a little bit more
oomph to it which i think is pretty nice
and then when you open it up these are
all of the shades and it does come with
a plastic insert that has all of these
shade names on it I always wish that the
shade names would be on the actual
palette but what I'll probably do just
like what I did with the Jaclyn hill
palette I think I'm just going to tape
this right up here so that way I can see
the shade names because when you do you
know tutorials and such on YouTube it's
nice to be able to say the shape names
and I know I will lose this it was on my
floor this weekend we were dog sitting
and the puppy got ahold of it so I don't
know if you can see if there's like dog
slobber on it but you know that's just
the life I live that's ok this is what
the inside of the palette looks like I
did feature this in a will about video I
said that I wanted to buy it I was very
drawn to it I like morphe eyeshadow
palettes I've purchased several myself
for 3/5 oh the 3/5 T the 3/5 are you
have the Jaclyn hill palette and it's
definitely one of my absolute staples
it's one of my favorite eyeshadow
palettes and I was really excited when I
saw the rebranding of the 3 500 they
said that they were relaunching the
palette to celebrate two years since the
3 500 came out the 3500 this is the
original this was definitely super hype
the original 3 500 will also be sold on
the Ulta website it looks like those are
there as well so here is the two
palettes a side by side so you can see
that they are definitely very similar
but to me this one is definitely more
colorful there's a lot more
like the oranges and the Reds in here
and then with the 3/5 oh I feel like it
focuses more on the lighter shades you
can see like the first two rows and the
first two rows over here especially you
know you have a lot of those really
really light shades so I feel like even
when you look at these two my eyes are
immediately drawn to the three 5:02
because I just feel like it's a very
vibrant palette and that was what
excited me about it I was also excited
because they came out with the 3/5 are a
little bit before the Jaclyn hill
palette release and I thought the
formula was really really awesome and
then they came out - Jacqueline Hill
palette and I thought the formula was
even better so I was excited to see what
the formula would be like in here and I
mean for sure it's a step above two
steps above three steps above the
original 3500 and some of the you know
older palettes that I have tried from
morphe like the 35 tee and things like
that I feel like it is definitely much
better I also feel like I'm talking very
best because grants so much to get
through and this is video I don't want
to make it too long but definitely the
formula is much better I mean even when
I was going through and swatching this
palette when I was like putting my
fingers into the mat they are very like
creamy the shimmers in here every single
shimmer in here is like that foiled
shadow and kind of what I first
experienced with the 35 our palette and
definitely what I experienced in the
Jaclyn hill palette and they are
absolutely stunning I did go through and
swatch everything so I will insert some
a swatch photos in here for you to see
but I will also do a couple swatches of
some of my favorite items here because I
would like to do some on camera as well
so these are some swatches up from the
first row we have Universal and then orb
and then also amber and then sizzle so
here are those washed out and those are
me just you know doing and then swiping
it I don't have primer or anything like
that I didn't use a damp finger or
anything like that
either's and then here are some swatches
from the second row we have heat and
then ablaze and then sauce and then Ruby
so here are those swatches I mean
this row is probably my favorite from
the palette I've already gone into that
row several times because I mean just
the payoff that you're giving with these
shades is so so good there are some from
the third row and I'm doing the
horizontal rows just so you know we have
zodiac and then polished and then rustic
and zippy and I'll go ahead and show you
just how easily these swatch on my hand
cuz it's really like a thing of beauty
oh oh so pretty so those are all
shimmers from the third horizontal row
that I'm doing stunning I have used a
polish all over my eyes I do have an
Instagram a tutorial that I will leave a
link down below if you want to see it
using this palette and I used a polished
going into the second to last row we
have some at deeper shades here so this
is risky and then chestnut and also
brave and then in the zone and so here
are those matte shades from the second
to last row horizontal in the palate and
then from the bottom row we have fawn
and then brunette muddy and then the
black in the palette which is called Wiz
and then here are those for swash style
on my hand well insert some of swatch
photos here and how I did those swatches
is I actually went vertical down the row
from the pallet and I took a couple of
our photos because I can't fit 35
swatches all on my arm it's just not
possible
so I kind of broke it up but I will go
ahead and insert those now if you want
to see those swatches and I did do the
swatches the same way my fingers were
dry I just went in and I just go one two
three and then swatch I didn't have any
primer or anything laid down on my arm
so that is how I do my swatches all
insert those photos here
you
it definitely is better than the three
5l for sure it reminds me a ton a ton of
the Jacqueline Hill palate especially
these shimmers in here I think the
shimmers are definitely better than the
mattes a lot of the mats are fantastic
you know especially these like in the in
the top section some of the lighter
shades the bottom row does not impress
me as much except for the black I
actually thought the black was really
good and I don't like the black and the
deck of the hill palette this is an
actual eye I feel like this is even
blacker I don't think it's the blackest
black eyeshadow that I've ever used but
it was definitely better than the Jaclyn
hill one and it's just easier to blend
in the jukin Hill palette I felt like
that black shadow was kind of Skippy and
not very blendable and this black I'm
actually pretty impressed with but other
than that the bottom row I didn't think
were the best kind of hard to blend when
we get to the like top three rows of the
palette very impressed I really don't
have any complaints
I like these Browns I mean every single
shimmer in here I feel like hits it out
of the park honestly I have not been
displaced with any of the shimmers that
I've tried on my eyes and I have tried
almost every single one except for like
two or three I want to say but other
than that like I've been trying so hard
to try out as many as I could so I could
make this review video of course I
wanted to do a review video versus a
first impressions because I just feel
like those are a little bit more helpful
and especially now that this palette is
coming in to alta I know that more
people are even more you know
questioning it is the palette worth it
and all of that so I really wanted to be
able to play with it as much as I could
my thing that I feel like is kind of
missing from the palette is that like
matte white shade that I go in with
first the original 3/5 of does have that
shade and lots of transition colors lots
of the deep bronze
I loved that they included a black in
here because the original 3/5 L doesn't
have a black and like I said this is
actually a fantastic black and one
concern that I had was you know maybe
some of these shimmers over here like I
feel like on camera like these two
especially look super similar in person
you can tell a difference but when I'm
looking at my viewfinder I'm like those
look super similar so I was a little bit
concerned about that but going through
and swatching them they're actually are
naughty
like minuscule differences between them
there are big differences between them I
think and putting them on my eyes I felt
like you could see a difference so I was
happy about that I did go through and
over the weekend as well i swatched the
new three 5:02 compared to the three 5l
compared to the jaclyn hill palette I
had them all three light on my bench I
opened all of them I stared them a lot I
played around with some of the different
shades swatch different shades and I
have a couple of video clips that I can
insert here you know trying to find a
dupe and trying to see you know really
if you do have the 3/5 oh is it worth it
to have the 3/5 Oh - is there enough
differences in there it's the formula
different enough the colors different
enough and that sort of thing and then
also to the Jacqueline Hill palette
because I know when the Jacqueline Hill
palette came out a lot of people said if
you have a 3/5 oh you don't need the
Jaclyn hill palette so I wanted to see
if I could find any comparable dupes in
those clips as well so here are some
swatches of matte browns so the first
three are from the new 3502 palette we
have Universal ORV and tan the next
three swatches are from the original
three 500 in the first row I have shade
number five the second row shade number
seven and third row the first shade and
then the last four are from the Jaclyn
hill palette we have the silk cream n
feo
butter and pooter so I think o RB from
the three 502 and then this shade right
here from the original three 500 this is
in the second row in the seventh shade
think those two are pretty similar and
then here are some swatches of oranges
and reds so these are first two oranges
right here the first one is fun with the
new three 502 palette that one is called
ablaze the second one is from the
original 3 500 butts in the first row
and it's the seventh shade there wasn't
really a matte orange and the Jacqueline
Hill palette so I just watched those two
since those are matte orange and then
the next shades we have are more red
based so the first two shades are from
the new 3502 palette we have heat and
then fire and then the next one is from
the 3/5 oh it's in the third row it's
the shade 7
and then the last two are from the
jaclyn hill palette its hunts and then
Jax Jax looks red in the pan but it's
actually more of like a cranberry shade
so closest ones out of these I would say
are heat and then hunts but I think Hans
has more brown in it like maybe a brown
undertone and then this one is more just
red I would say and then here are some
darker shades the the first two are the
blacks in the three 5:02 and then the
Jaclyn hill palette the three five oh
does not have a matte black in there so
those are the shades Wiz and of this and
then the next three are some darker
shades across the three pallets the
first one is the three 502 in the shade
muddy the middle one is from the three
500 it's in the last row and it's the
fish shape v shape and then the last one
is from the Jaclyn hill palette and that
is in Central Park
here are some swatches of shimmer shades
so from the three 502 pellets starting
down here we have the shade Ruby and
then the next three are all from the
Jaclyn hill palette and that is
cranapple a firework and then he'll stir
and then the last set of swatches are
some more like gold tones the first two
are from the 3502 palette they are zippy
and rustic the third one is from the
original 3500 it's in the last row it's
the seventh shade and then the last one
is from the Jaclyn hill palette and that
is in Queen really I'm not finding a lot
of dupes and shimmer wise this is the
third set that i've swatched on my arm
and I just rubbed the other two off
because nothing was really too similar
but and then here's two more that I
found that I feel like are somewhat
similar to each other but I still don't
say that they're dupes third one is from
a d3 502 it's in polished and then the
second one is from the Jaclyn hill
palette and that one is in firework I'm
going to compare it against the original
3/5 oh I mean you're getting a better
eye shadow palette you're getting a
better formula you're getting you know
more pigments at more blendable shades
and you're getting actual like foiled
shimmer shadows versus bees which I feel
like are just kind of like your standard
shimmers when it's $23 so
I don't know I kind of almost say even
if you do have the three five oh if you
like these shades in here and if you
think it would be worth it to you I
would suggest getting the new three 500
- I just think it's a better palette as
a whole so if you don't have the
original three 500 and you're trying to
decide between which palette I would say
the three 502 it's definitely a huge
step up from the original do you need
them both that's up for you to decide
how often do you think that you'll reach
into this one do you not really reach
into your 3 500 anymore you know maybe
you're not as attracted to these shades
then I wouldn't suggest it you know
things like that but if you like allowed
the morphe palette if you're into these
much more vibrant shades like that's the
thing that I keep thinking when I look
at this palette it is so much more
vibrant and colorful than this palette
which almost now that I'm looking at
this one I feel like this is a much more
neutral palette which is where when I
used to think of a 3/5 L I would think
orange and fall and all of that but
compared to this one I mean honestly to
me I feel like there's really not a
comparison in my opinion so I know a lot
of people were saying that the 3500 was
similar to the Jaclyn hill pallid so
here they are together I really don't
feel like these are very similar I mean
the Jaclyn hill palette has like the
greens and the purples and the blues
which you're obviously not getting any
of those colors in here I feel like both
pilots have a lot of the Browns like the
mat Browns and stuff and a few of the
red shades but again I really struggle
to find dupes I think the black is
better in the 3 502 for sure but I feel
like I'm reaching into these palettes
for different things honestly I mean I I
don't know maybe it's just me but I
don't feel like these are super similar
you Jackson Hale palette is more
expensive and I mean I do have a review
video on the junk and Hill palette if
you'd want to see that one I can link it
down below this also will be available
at Ulta and apparently it's getting a
makeover as well it's going to have
different packaging and stuff so that's
very interesting if you have the
Jacqueline Hill palette and what I say
to get the three 5:02 I would say yes
because I feel like they're different
enough some of the shimmers in here
you're not getting in the Jacqueline
Hill palette and I think this is what
really makes this palette such I stand
out is those
fabulous oiled shades kind of what I
think comparison wise and hopefully some
of the swatches helped out as well
across the three pallets but I did do
this I look as a tutorial as well if you
want to see it I'll jump into that clip
next I did ass on my Twitter what kind
of look II wanted to see I said orange
shimmer hot red or bronze or gold look
and hot red one but the gold bronze was
right behind it so I thought I would try
to emerge the two so if you would like
to see a little tutorial on how I got
this eye look I'll go ahead and insert
those clips here so jumping into the
palette I'm gonna pick up the fourth eye
shade in the first row this is called
tan and I'm using the morphe e27 brush
and I'm just going to use this as my
first transition color and sweep it into
the crease I am gonna come in with tape
later but I actually find tape very
uncomfortable so I don't put it on until
I absolutely have to have it on and then
I'm going to come into this second shade
here in the second row it is called
contour I'm using a sigma e25 for this
one and I'm just gonna apply that a
little bit lower than the first shade
and again just blend it out and then
this is where I'm going to use the tape
so I just use a little bit of scotch
tape and I apply it to the back of my
hand first and take it off a couple
times this leaves it a little bit less
is sticky so it doesn't hurt your face
that when you pull it off I'm coming
into the shade fire here which is the
beautiful red I'm just using a blending
brush from the morphe copper dreams
asset and I'm just going to slowly start
to build this up because it is a pretty
intense color I'm just going to slowly I
make sure any excess stepped off slowly
start to build it up on the outer part
of the crease and I use the tape as a
guide to kind of start to wing out that
shade as well work to slowly build it up
I don't want to come in too intense
right away and then have to work really
hard to blend it out so that is why I
work in these small
options for the shimmer I'm going to use
the shade bronze it is in the first row
top row it's the last shade and I'm
going to use the Sigma II of 56 brush
it's very my brush with a bit of mac
fix+ first because i want it to make it
really metallic and then I'm just going
to apply this to the inner part of my
eye and just slowly like when I get to
the center of my eye I'm just kind of
brushing it into that red then I'm going
to come back to the e27
and just kind of make sure everything is
blend it together and then I'm going to
peel off the tape so we have that nice
sharp line there it did add some lashes
these are the Coquette lashes from a
blinking Butte I didn't do any liner
because I just really liked the way that
this looks so I'm gonna finish off the
lower lash line I did put some brown
liner in it's my waterline and then I'm
going to pick up the shade fire on a
more PE 43 just a flat definer brush and
then I'm just going to push this shade
along the lower lash line and then I'm
going to grab the shade at contour which
was the second shade that we added on to
our eyes and I'm going to use a pencil
brush this is the morphe M 507 and I'm
just going to sweep that along the lower
lash line kind of help blend out that
red as well I'll just add some mascara a
little bit later to my bottom lash line
but then that is how I got this a fiery
bronzy I look wrap it all up I mean the
main point of making this video is would
I recommend the morphe 35o 2 palette and
do I think it is worth a 23 dollars and
that is a yes I have been very impressed
with this palette very impressed with
the shade I'll put my comparisons with
the 3 500 and the Jaclyn hill pellet
helped because I totally understand you
know not all of us are makeup collectors
and love getting all of these new
releases which I you can totally
understand so hopefully some of that
helped as well and you know of course at
the end of the day it's just makeup and
it's completely your decision on what
you choose to buy and what you choose to
pass over are interesting
that you would get a lot of use out of
it I think for $23 that this is frickin
bomb I mean I was shocked when I saw
that they weren't raising the price on
this palette because I honestly thought
that they were going to so to keep it up
the $23 for all of these different
shades and how well that they perform
I'm very impressed I have to give it to
morphe on this one I think this is a
freaking awesome
palette so I hope that my review and the
other items in here helped you guys out
