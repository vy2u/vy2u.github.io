I also picked up an extra one for you
guys so I will also be giving one morphe
35o palette away I'm really happy to be
giving one away so make sure you watch
till the end I'll go over the giveaway
how to enter who can enter first I want
to jump into this palette I did mention
this in last week's will i buy it video
and i said not only was i planning on
buying it but that it actually already
had bought it I bought it I think the
day after it released I saw that it was
still in stock it was my birthday I was
like I'm going for it so I placed a
morphing order so I'm gonna show you
guys the palette and this video is
mostly focused on the palette when I'm
gonna pop in a few other items that I
picked up as well so it's like a little
mini morphe haul in here too but I asked
in my will i buy it video you know I
bought this palette what do you guys
want to see do you want to see first
impression swatches demo do you not want
to see a video and the comments just
came in fast and furious that you guys
wanted definitely to see the swatches
and you wanted to know my thoughts on it
so that is why we are making this video
thank you guys as always for leaving
your comments it really helps me out so
the 35 art stands for Ready Set gold and
it is a 22 and 99 on the morphe website
there's always discount codes floating
around for 10% off of morphe so you can
always get a discount if you're
interested in that but why don't we go
ahead open this palette up and do some
swatches and I'll let you guys know what
I think of the 35 are okay so when you
open the palette up this is what she
looks like and she is beautiful I opened
this up with my snapchat BAM and it was
so beautiful that the palette actually
shut itself on me I opened it up all
like oh and then the pellet immediately
shut and I was like oh it's because I
couldn't handle it it was like too much
prettiness it was too much the palette
had to like make sure I understood that
that moment and what was happening
because seriously this palette is
freaking stunning it's gorgeous I saw it
first on Justin Hill snapchat and I Emil
it was just like what is that what is
that I need that
I started seeing it on the Instagram on
the Instagram I started seeing it on
Instagram and I just knew I knew that I
had to have it I was really worried
because like I said I didn't buy it the
day that it launched I bought it the day
after and I was like oh man it's gonna
be sold out I just know it and I
couldn't believe it was still in stock
it's still in stock right now at the
time that I'm filming it's still in
stock and I will leave it linked down
below there are 18 mats there are 15
shimmers and there are two Sheen's I
believe I'm saying that correctly and I
really like the layout of this palette
as well because we have all the mats
over here these two right here are the
Sheen's and then all of this side is the
shimmers and I mean can we just
the shimmers it's so stunning they are
they they are stunning that is what sold
this palette to me I love my eyeshadows
I wear matte eyeshadows way more than I
wear shimmer shadows when I went on
vacation I basically just wore a neutral
brown on my eyes the entire five days
that's all I wore but I'm sorry when you
see shimmers like this I don't know what
I don't how do you not get excited for
this I got excited for this when I went
through and did the swatches it was like
jaw-dropping moments gorgeous swatched
beautifully I haven't put him on my eyes
yet cuz we're gonna do a first
impression on my eyes together so we can
see how they actually worked but I will
tell you from the swatches that I've
done I'm immediately just like yes
please did we just become best friends I
think so if you have to other morphe
pellets that are in like the 35 family
so this one was actually the first one
that I got it's the 35 T so you can see
you know super similar layout this one
is like miles and golds and I don't know
if you can tell but like I beat the crap
out of this palette I have the 3500 as
well like the cult favorite from morphe
and I've used the crap out of that too
so I was really happy to get another one
like these are such a good value morphe
I think has really good eye shadows I
hear really good things about them
that's why I started buying from them
and I've been really happy I wouldn't
buy this many eyeshadows and eyeshadow
palettes if I didn't really enjoy the
products and you $2 435i shadows I think
I think that's a steal but what I like
the most about the 30
our and it's layout because if you could
tell from the 30 15 the 3 500 the
shimmers and the mats are kind of like
intermixed and with these I like that we
have mats and we have shimmers like I
really mmm
I enjoy that I do like that there are
more mattes and shimmers because like I
said I'm definitely more of a matte girl
I think you can do what complete makeup
look using only mattes I don't really
think that you can do a complete makeup
look using shimmers at least for me and
like my everyday makeup look I need
mattes in there there's beautiful Browns
there's transitions there's really nice
mob shades in here
the Sheen's especially this one once we
get into the swatches I'll show you that
one that one really stuck out to me we
have the deeper colors here which are
fantastic and then of course I feel like
the shimmers just speak for themselves
I really like the layout of the 35 are a
lot and I don't know if that is
something that I really have ever
thought about like with the two other
palettes I've never been like oh I wish
the layout was different I don't think I
thought of that but once I saw this and
I saw that the way all the shadows were
placed I was like oh yeah that does make
sense I really do like that so I thought
I'd throw that out there suppressions
like I said when I was watching super
happy with it I'm very excited to get
some of these on my eyes but why don't
we go ahead I'll go through each row I
do have swatches to insert so you guys
can see what they look like on my arm
and then I'll go ahead and pick out some
of my favorites from each row and show
you swatches of them right here so let's
get into some swatches so the way that I
did the swatches is I went like this
line wise vertical there we go
technical terms here so the first row is
the matte shades and I think these two
the second and the third I feel like
those are really gonna be when I kind of
use the most and get the most out of
just really nice transition shades like
shades that I need every single day like
I just I need these in my life to be
happy those are some swatches and super
nice I just I need those type of colors
for when I'm doing makeup looks so I
feel like those are gonna be the two
that I reach for the most and then for
the second row it was again the second
and third colors that kind of stuck out
to me I really like this brown shade
because it's not the typical like
transition Brown it only says more on
like I don't want to say Bay
that's not what I'm going for but I
don't know it just it's it's different
and nothing
so that is what those look like and then
these are the swatches there see you can
tell from that one like it's not your
traditional brown like it has a little
bit of something different to it so I
really liked those from the second row
and then moving on to the third row I
will say that this second shade really
didn't do much for me when i swatched it
it might be good is like a brow bone
highlight but other than that that was
really the only shade that i swatched
that had me really underwhelmed so I did
want to throw that out there but the two
that I thought were really interesting
in the in the third row we're definitely
the sheen finishes that is what they
look like and they are swatched out I
thought they were both really beautiful
colors and I liked the finish to them I
thought that was really pretty so those
were definitely the two that stuck out
to me in the third row moving on to the
fourth row we have some of the deeper
shades there
I don't gravitate towards the like
really deep dark brown shades a lot
unless I'm doing like a smoky eye or if
I need it for underneath my lash line
but I'm much more of like the neutral
type of girl so it was actually the
first shade that caught my attention and
then honestly this last one because I
think it would be really pretty on the
other on the under eyes it's a deep
chocolate brown this one right here but
to me it wasn't like super overwhelming
so those are some of the swatches there
but again for the fourth row like if you
love really dark smoky eyes or you reach
for the dark ones a lot like that's
gonna be that's gonna be your row and
then moving on to the next row that's
when we start getting into the shimmers
and man I just just I don't know how to
pick I mean definitely this gold was so
friggin stunning I'm just gonna do three
I'm just gonna do the last three like
look at those are you kidding me look at
that gold so freakin stunning cannot
wait to get these on my eyes then for
the second to last row honestly there
are so many beautiful ones I don't
really know how to choose I really
didn't think of this very first shade
it's super
light I was like oh you know it'll
probably be fine no it actually is
really really gorgeous so let me just
swatch I'm gonna swatch another three
and let me see if I can show you guys
like how beautiful like are those not so
gorgeous love this middle shade this
kind of orange oh I just it's so
beautiful but isn't that one so nice for
being the lighter shade like that one
really surprised me super pigmented like
thought it would be like a really light
shade like probably wouldn't even show
up so to have that I was like okay and
then again for the last row it's like so
hard to pick favorites I'm just gonna
swatch the first three here because they
are so stunning here they are on my
fingers and that yep are you kidding me
beautiful beautiful beautiful first
definitely are like what are getting me
the most from this palette they're
really stunning but of course like I
said I really appreciate that we have
the math in there as well because I do
need the mattes to make a complete eye
look feel I feel like this palette has
it all like first impressions I made a
new best friend we are in a committed
relationship we're very happy together
thank you so much so now that we've gone
through and seen some swatches I'm gonna
actually put some shadows on my eyes I'm
nervous because this is like the moment
of truth you know sometimes when i
swatched the allarakha brunch palette I
was like ooh and then I put them on my
eyes and I was like oh okay so hopefully
I'm just as excited as I am once I get
these on my eyes because that's really
the true test because I don't walk
around the swatches on my arms telling
people look at my new eyeshadow palette
I'm going to start with this color in
the second row that I said I enjoyed and
that was a little bit more unique I'm
taking up my morphe m4 for one I'm going
to apply this into my crease okay that
is super that's that's very pigmented
okay okay this is why pigmented I'm
going to be blending for a while here
look at that that's crazy I was not
expecting that so let me blend for two
hours and I'll get back to you
alright so definitely a little bit goes
a very
Longway that was awesome then i'm going
to pick up this first shave right here
in the fourth row and I'm using my
morphe m4 3-3 gonna put this right onto
the outer crease its to darken that up
and give it a little bit of definition
out here and now the part I am most
excited for I'm going in with this gold
the wound up just been like salivating
over I'm gonna put this onto the eyelid
and I'm using my morphe g13 I'm gonna go
in with no fix plus or anything just so
we can see what it looks like and then
I'll decide if I think if it needs a
spray alright that is stunning
gold is everything that I was hoping it
would be it is everything I was hoping
Miss B I have no mac fix+
just so you guys know none this is just
a railer old eyeshadow yeah okay so this
is all we got so far I know I'm only
using three shades and I didn't do
anything like wild and crazy but when I
do like first impression demos I like to
stick with what I know and do something
more simple instead of like trying to be
wild and crazy and then I'm like getting
myself all sorts of confused and mixed
up whoa
loving this so far I'm gonna put some
lashes on and then I'll come back to
finish off the lower lash line add some
lip and get into the giveaway so I
wasn't gonna do liner or lashes now my
camera was cooling down and then I just
went in and did them real quick and I
feel like you can tell that I just did
it real quick to finish off the lower
lash line I put just a little bit of mr.
Bing from colour-pop in my waterline and
then I'm gonna grab my morphe e36 I'm
going to grab this second shade right
here from the first row and just put
this on the lower lash line even that I
feel like I barely put any on I tapped
it out and it's still so pick my dad
like it's a lighter shape but holy
buckets I'm not expecting this you take
just a little bit of shimmer and just
like pop it just just just pop it real
quick I want to take this shade right
here just a little bit and just place it
right in like this
center of the lower lash line just to
give a little shimmer down here to just
a little bit nothing too crazy but I
liked about these shadows was that they
were super pigmented but there wasn't
like I really didn't experience any
fallout even with the mask and when i
swatched the shimmers some of them kind
of swatched a little bit like kind of on
the chunky side I would say and so I I
was worried about fallout but like with
the gold that I placed all over my eyes
I mean you saw it I played it on the
camera I didn't really have any sort of
fallout so that's awesome it made me
even happier than doing the swatches and
I was really really happy with the
swatches obviously but because of how
pigmented they were like seriously you
guys from the just a couple of shapes
that I use a little bit will go a very
long way like you saw what happened when
I really dipped my brush into that first
light transition shade and put it on it
was way more pigmented then I thought it
was gonna be I like that we don't have
to deal with fallout I am okay I am
impressed assume when you back out I am
gonna do a lip color but I want to show
you what else I picked up from my morphe
haul so obviously I got a 35 are I also
picked up the flawless a beauty sponge
I've been waiting and waiting for this
sponge to come in stock and I think now
there's like another sponge that
everybody's freaking out about and that
one isn't in stock but now this one is
in stock and this was the one that I
really want it I just really like the
shape so this is what the sponge looks
like I'm super excited to try it out has
anybody tried the flawless sponge yet I
wanted to get it
I'd heard really good things I also
picked up a brush this is the are - look
at that Big Daddy I said in one of my
videos that I like big brushes and I do
like big brushes this is the art - I'm
gonna use it as a bronzing brush I saw
Jacqueline Hill in one of her recent
video saying that she loved this for
bronzer so I'm really excited I clearly
did not have enough bronze around today
I look pale as it goes need to do some
self-tanning in my life or just get a
new a big ol brother brush so I also
picked up some liquid lipsticks I got
two different shades this one is in
peanut and then I also got another one
and this one is in schoolgirl so that is
what they look like I haven't tried any
of the Marquee liquid lipsticks these
are
fairly new releases but I wanted to give
them a try and then I wanted to wear on
for this video so it applies really
smoothly it's definitely a thinner
formula I wouldn't say it's like moosie
or thick or anything like that but it
goes on easily a really pretty shade I
like that that went on very smoothly
I'll show you what the applicator looks
like I don't know what I would compare
it to right off the bat it almost kind
of reminded me of Kylie cosmetics or
like the NYX lingerie lipsticks is kind
of what it reminded me of application
why I just really wanted to be able to
try out their liquid lipsticks and you
just spend a hundred dollars to get free
shipping at morphe and you guys know
that I love free shipping so I was like
yeah let's get some lipsticks too but
with school roll on my lips the 35 are
