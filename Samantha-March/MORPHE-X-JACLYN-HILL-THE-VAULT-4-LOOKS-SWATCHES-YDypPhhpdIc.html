today's video I am wickedly excited to
do because it is going to be all about
the new morphe and Jaclyn hill
collaboration I was so surprised and so
excited when this showed up on my
doorstep last night this is the pr
package that more be sent out to some
bloggers and well I was excited to get
this and I know a lot of people are
really looking forward to this
collaboration and you know want to see
the pellets and want to see how they
perform so I took to my snapchat on my
instagram stories right away I already
shared some swatches over there and I
asked what you guys would want to see
because I wanted to film with this right
away and the majority vote was people
said they wanted to see a look with each
of the four different pallets so that is
what today's video is going to be it is
not going to be a review I have only
swatch these pellets I have put nothing
on my eyes so far so it's all going to
be trying it for the first time today I
am planning on coming back and doing
every view and also comparison video
with these pallets and with the original
Jaclyn hill palette because I know a lot
of people have questions about that as
well but today's video is just going to
be all about show you guys each of the
four pallets in here is watching
everything and then also doing a look
with each of the four pallets on my eyes
so I'm pretty excited about that this
was one need to PR package so the
collection that Jaclyn is doing with
morphe now it is called the vault so
that's kind of what this package kind of
signifies here which i thought was super
cute but basically I just opened this up
and then you have Jacqueline's photo
here a little bit about the collection
and then you have these four different
pallets inside so what this is
pertaining you have a four pallets each
one that looks like this
there is ten different shades inside
each one it also does come with a mirror
you can buy the collection for $49 or
you can purchase the pallets
individually at $15 apiece so that's a
little bit about the collection and what
I'm going to be doing in today's video
we have a lot to do I've never done a
video with four different looks before
but
go ahead and get started okay so I'm
going to talk about each pallet
individually share it up close share the
swatches and do the eye look
so a first step I'm gonna start with the
pallet ring the alarm now one thing that
I notice about these pallets that I
think are pretty darn cool is that each
pallet has a different color theme in
here so this one here is the red pallet
so where it says ring the alarm on the
side of the pallet there that's also in
red and then all of the details on the
front are the same except if you can see
sprinkled and there are kind of like the
red confetti marks and each pallet has
that as well so the purple pallet has
the purple lettering and the purple
confetti I thought that was pretty darn
cool I also think it's pretty slick that
each of the pallets have a mirror that
was one of my complaints with the
initial morphe palette that it didn't
have a mirror in it and also I really
enjoy that the shade names are listed
right in here in the pallet you can see
all of the shade names in there that was
another one of my complaints as well my
original Jaclyn hill palette I taped the
names to my pallet so I so I could know
what the shade names are so and my
Jaclyn hill palette looks like a mess
because this is one of my favorite
palettes so I was pretty darn excited
when I saw that they were coming out the
new collection like I said I was so
surprised to get it in PRI I do get
something from morphe but I just for
whatever reason I thought for sure like
they would not send that to me so I was
I was so so excited and so grateful
because I'm really excited to be able to
make this video and I wanted to do it
right away cuz I know I've been getting
asked so many questions on it and even
when I first shared the first photo last
night we're like what's the palette like
tell me what they are like people wanted
to know right then I was like I promise
you I'm filming tomorrow I promise
promise promise so I wanted to get this
video up as quick as I could so I did
watch Jacqueline's video and she did say
kind of the idea behind having these new
four pallets out is that when she was
doing the original palette with morphe
35o palette and she said there was so
many other colors in there that she
wanted to include but they they just
couldn't fit into the 35 palette so her
and linda morphe decided to come up with
another collection a year later and have
some of those from the vault
some of the shade
didn't make it into that palette make it
into these pallets you want to do a full
look with the eye makeup if I want to do
any lashes with it and also a lip color
so you can see it all come together so
my apologies that this video is a little
bit longer but I wanted to be able to do
a look and a full look with each of the
four pallets so you can get a better
idea do you want them all do you only
want one or two from the collection and
that sort of thing so I do have my
makeup on everything except for my eye
shadow of my lip color of course but why
don't we go ahead and hop into the first
palette here which is a ring the alarm
I'll go ahead and show you a close-up of
the palette and also the swatches this
palette is definitely very very warm
toned you have a great mixture of matte
and shimmers this is one that when I saw
it I was like oh like these are just
like my tones these are a lot of the
shades you know like the shade family
that I reached for out of the Jaclyn
hill palette and I thought with this
palette I could do kind of like a blown
out smokey eye it's one of my go-to
looks with the original Jaclyn hill
palette so I don't ears on we are zoomed
in so I'm coming into a ring the alarm
and the first shade that I'm going to go
in with is the second one here which is
called rush and I'm just gonna take a
really big blending brush and I'm going
to work this into the crease and just be
really messy and sloppy with it I like
this kind of smoky eye because like
nothing's really precise and it actually
is very quick and very easy so I'm just
gonna go ahead and start to apply it
into the crease and work it up and then
I'm gonna take this more orange ear
shade which is alert and I'm going to
take a little smaller blending brush and
I'm also going to work that into the
crease and it's gonna be just a little
bit lower than that first shade but
again just kind of being a little sloppy
with it I will say I did swatch
everything in the palettes and to me I
felt like the shimmers were absolutely
outstanding and I mean I thought the
same in the Jaclyn hill palette again
I'm a huge fan that palette I've put it
in like if I could only keep one makeup
tag I was keeping that palette I've put
it in favorites videos it truly is one
of my favorite palettes and I think the
quality is really phenomenal and there
so again that was another reason why and
when I watched Jacqueline's video and
she was saying it is the same formula I
was like okay then I would be sold
because I thought palette is really
really high quality to me and so so far
I mean the shimmer is a swatched
absolutely phenomenal
most of the mattes did as well mostly
when we get into the darker shades
especially in the dark magic palette
those didn't smudge as well but honestly
most of those really dark tones never
really do for me and it really kind of
just depends on how they all perform on
the eyes so that is what I wanted to see
today I wanted to get everything on my
eyes so I can actually get up somewhat
better better feedback because swatches
are great and I do think that they're
important but obviously what matters
most is how the shades perform on the
eyes I'm going to keep my same brush and
I'm going to come into framed right here
which is more of a matte purple and I'm
also going to work that into the crease
but again even lower and I'm just going
to really blend all of that together
purple since it is so dark I want to
work on building it up instead of
putting a lot on to my brush and on to
my eyelid and really having to blend I'm
just gonna take it in like small steps
I'm gonna come in with an even smaller
brush and I'm going in to grab the shade
secret and I'm also just going to run
this on the outer part of my eye and
then also blend everything together just
just to kind of deepen things up out
here a for my lower lash line I'm going
to be repeating every single color that
I did and just sweeping it along the
lower lash line again and again just
being kind of sloppy with it so at first
I'm going to apply rush and then I'm
also going to apply alert which is that
more orange shade and then I'm going to
add framed which is the purple lay I'm
going to add secret
and then just make sure the lower lash
line is really blended out well I
believe a very like blown out smokey I
need some lashes so I'm going to go
ahead and pop these lashes on these are
from flutter lashes and the style
royalty okay so this is the look with
the lashes on the lash glue is probably
still drying but to keep it moving I'm
just gonna add my lip color so if they
look like this I like to do something
nude so this is from a lawless beauty
and is in the shade George is one of my
favorite nudes at the moment okay so
this is the first look with the ring the
alarm at pallid kind of my blown out a
smoky eye a look that I absolutely love
to do I look that I love doing with the
Jeff and Hill palette this is actually
really similar to the look that I have
in my profile photo which is the same
across like YouTube Instagram Twitter
Facebook all of that that is the look
that I was basically was recreating
today I can say that out of all of the
shades that I use in the palette which I
think were only four one two three four
yeah so I only used a four shades out of
ten for this one but I did use all
mattes and really I was very curious to
see how the mattes were going to apply
because like I said the mattes don't
swatch quite as well or as like boom as
like the shimmers do normally and that's
just across all pallets but I have to
say I was very impressed everything
blended out really easily for me I love
how all of the shades turned out I love
the oranges in there I love that purple
I thought that was a really stunning
color and so far so good before the
first a palette of that I tried so why
don't we go ahead and move over to
palette number two alrighty so next up
I'm going to go into the palette that I
am probably most intimidated by this one
is dark magic so this one is the green
palettes you can see there's a ton of
beautiful greens in there again we have
a mixture of matte and shimmers I
thought this one it was interesting
because it's really the only palette
that has this first kind of matte shade
that I laid down all over my eyelid
primer or my concealer but we have a
beautiful deep green we have a beautiful
deep blue we have a really cool kind of
foot I don't know how you describe this
kind of like green color it's it's like
a very dirty grungy green color the
shade temptress is also a very very
unique with a bunch of shimmer in there
as well very cool color
this palette just being how deep it is
and especially with the greens and the
blues it's not what I would consider to
be like my go-to norm looks and keep in
mind I'm not a makeup artist I'm an
author who lives in Iowa who also just
enjoys talking about makeup so sometimes
I don't have the artistically creative
mind to look at palettes and feel like I
know what I'm doing already so once
again we are zoomed in so since we do
have this first a shade poof I did go
ahead and put concealer on my under eyes
and also on my eyelid again but I'm just
gonna go ahead and use that to set my
concealer this is shade right up the bat
has a ton of pigment sometimes in
palettes this shade doesn't really have
a ton of pigment which is fine because
I'm usually just using it for this
purpose but then that you have those
palettes that this shape just comes out
like return to go and that would be the
case with this ballot cause I'm gonna
use a big blending brush and I'm gonna
pick up the shade which is more of a
cool toned Brown transition to me and
then I'm going to run this into the
crease as well I'm having to build this
one up a couple of times just wanted to
note that so now I'm going to go into
inside job which is this really dark
green matte shade and I'm gonna come in
with a smaller brush because I'm going
to slowly start to work it up on this
outer part of my eye again when I work
with dark shades I don't want to come in
too much too fast because then I get
real scared but I'm just going to take
my time and build up this color I've
been tapping really lightly into that
shade and it's coming across very very
pigmented so far and we getting a little
bit of Fallout over here as well with
that dark shade which honestly doesn't
surprise me
especially with how pigmented it is with
how little shadow I'm using I also like
to use a more pointed brush like this
it's the Sigma e45 because I can kind of
make that shape you know kind of taking
those shadows out to a point instead of
being more blended
going forward this one I am going to cut
the crease I'm going to use my color pop
no filter concealer and I'm going to
place this along the inner part of my
eye where I don't have any shadows yet
and then up into the crease as well so I
wanted to look something like that
and then I'm going to take that smaller
brush that I was using and I'm just
gonna kind of blend along the concealer
line and then I'm going to grab a small
shader brush and go into the shade at
trickery which is that green with some
shimmer I am gonna spray my brush I
normally spray it my brushes when I'm
working with any shimmers and especially
since I do it my face done it can help
prevent some fallout and then I'm just
going to start to pack that color on the
center of the lid Dini glitter there's
like flecks of glitter that got stuck
under the tip of my brush there so it's
not the shadow it's just shimmery but I
was like I know I saw that piece of
glitter fallout I was like where's that
glitter come from it's stuck in my brush
so go follow those well that I did not
realize that when I grabbed it but I'm
just placing that shade in the center of
the lid here so I'm still leaving that
beginning part length and then I'm gonna
take an even tinier brush this is the
Sigma smudgy 21 again I'm going and to
spray it and I'm gonna pick up a little
bit of power cut this shimmer here I'm
gonna pack that on to this very inner
corner of the eye and I want this to
really blend into the other green so I'm
just gonna use my brush and just kind of
merge the two together what does
everybody sent to us Mary I'm gonna
marry the two together that's what you
go do girl so before I put lashes on my
camera is gonna overheat so I'm going to
do the other eye off-camera since the
cut crease does take a while but here is
what the eye looks like book I put
lashes on and complete the lower lash
line as well so I'm gonna have to wipe
away this follow up also so
just want to let you guys see what it
looked like before I dust that away I
just added some lashes from Nicki oh joy
these are the Charlotte lashes and then
I put just a tiny bit of deep end liner
from urban decay into my waterline so
for the lower lash line I kind of want
to do a little bit of blue I feel like I
should go green but I'm super curious
about this blue so I'm gonna come in to
busted and put it on a flat definer
brush this is the Sigma II 15 and then
I'm just gonna push that really close to
my lower lash line and then once again
I'm going to grab my tiny smudge brush
and take a little bit more power cut and
I'm going to apply that to the rest of
the lash line and then also on the inner
corner okay so that is it for the island
so I'm going to add my lip color this is
age sex location from Mac one of my
favorite news already so this is the
finished look with palette number two at
the dark magic palette I have to say I
was nervous about this palette but I do
like the way that's a look it came out I
tried to do something similar to the eye
look that I had I think it was in my
most recent makeup I regret buying video
because I got a lot of requests to do a
tutorial on that and this is really
similar to that and it's the same kind
of technique where I kind of take the
shadow out more into the wing and then I
also kind of have this color scheme
going on I did use the color pop and
kathleenlights dream street palette for
that tutorial so I wanted to create
something as similar as I could to it to
show you guys how I got it I think I was
even wearing age sex location in that
video which is why I chose it for this
look so I have to say overall I'm pretty
happy with it so I use one two three
four five six six shadows of a ten out
of this one I do like it I do have to
say trickery and inside job were more
similar than I thought that they would
be I really thought trickery was gonna
have a lot more shimmer in it and it did
it I mean it does have shimmer in it it
does but they were more similar than I
thought and again that could be because
I was putting them right next to each
other on my eyes and you know I don't
know but they were more similar
power-cut is an absolutely phenomenal
color and I'm like I'm loving how the
inner corners of my eye
look I have to say - I also thought
inside job was just a little bit more on
the patchy side if I had to compare it
to the look of that I did with the dream
straight pallid that one was a little
bit easier to work with so I did want to
go ahead and just based on first
impressions say that that was something
that I noticed that blue though that I
put on the lower lash line is absolutely
stunning and I know it's such a small
little area but I love how that looks
and I really want to put that one all
over the lid there was some fallout with
that deeper green eyeshade the inside
job and then also some fallout with a
power cut as well so I would suggest
using the setting spray with the shimmer
and just using just doing your eyes
before you were to do your face makeup
with this palette but again that doesn't
surprise me with of these darker shades
I find that fairly common amongst most
of the palettes so overall I'm still
pretty happy with this one I was nervous
about it but I'm happy and there's still
a lot more colors in here that I'm
pretty darn excited to play with so that
is the lucky number 2 for the dark magic
palette alrighty so I am back for look
number three pilot number three we are
going to be using armed and gorgeous
this one is more of the yellow palette
and this one is really quite fun this
was one that I was eyeing I really like
the shade access but honestly these
golds in here they swatch so beautifully
both guilt-trip and coin they swatched
so gorgeous I also like the oranges in
here VIP is a really cool white shade
top secret also has my attention so I am
still not quite a hundred percent sure
what I'm gonna do for my island I want
to try something a little bit different
and kind of focus it more on like the
yellow and move that yellow gold shade
that's really beautiful already so first
up I'm going to take the shade agent
over here which looks like a nice
transition shade I'm going to use a big
fluffy brush this kind of looks like a
brown with some orange to it and I'm
just going to work that into the crease
as well my eyes are kind of like what
are you what are you doing what's what's
happening here
so I'm gonna be excited that after this
and after it if I make a point hard time
and then I can just let it stay because
my eyes are
not used to this alright and then I want
to try something a little bit different
so I'm gonna take the shade access kind
of for of this like yellow it's not just
like a straight yellow it has a little
bit of something else in it and I'm
gonna take a flat shader brush the sigma
e55 i didn't spare me a brush or
anything like that but i'm just gonna
tap off the excess and i'm going to pack
this pretty much all over the lid i was
actually coming off more like more
yellow than i thought on the eyes
which actually has me really excited I
really think it much fallout on that
eyes so that's pretty good this is more
yellow than I thought it was gonna be on
the eyes that has me so excited I didn't
think I did Thank You B and I love like
I'm really into yellow right now y'all
ilex little shirts see little dresses
like I'm into it all I'm just gonna do
quick blend with my first brush and I'm
gonna pick up a flat brush I'm going to
spray it and I really want to try out
the shade coin because it looks amazing
so I'm going to pick up a little bit of
coin right here when i swatched it ups
like please get on my eyes so I'm just
gonna kind of tap this on over the
yellow I do anything to precise like I
didn't want to cut the crease or
anything I still gonna keep this on like
the inner half of my eye okay so
actually I like this I'm or I didn't
take it quite as far as this side so I'm
gonna come back and add a little bit
more yellow over here because I like how
we have like the shimmer that fades into
the yellow that kind of fades into that
orange transition I should really like
the way that looks I'm getting a little
bit of fallout from the yellow song to
go ahead and dust that away but so this
look I'm trying to keep this one it's
like my super simple look that I'm doing
but I'm really curious about this green
so I want to put it on at my lower
lashline so I'm gonna take a little bit
of top secret and a pencil brush just
going to smudge that along the lower
lash line and I'm gonna keep it on the
outer half of my eye then I'm going to
take a little bit of a bigger pencil
brush and pick up secure which is kind
of like this hot orange and I'm going to
start that in the middle of the eye and
then blend it through the green and then
also towards the inner corner
so it definitely calls for a little bit
of VIP in the inner corner this is like
a shocking white with shimmer in it it
was crazy cool when i swatched it but i
feel like you need a very little amount
wait so this is the island before i put
lashes on honestly with this eye look I
probably wouldn't wear lashes I would
just put on some mascara and be good to
go but I am trying to do lashes with
each of the different looks I feel like
they look better for photos and I'm also
taking photos for Instagram and filming
videos for Instagram at the same time
that I'm filming this video I've now
been filming for three and a half hours
so we're doing a lot we're doing a lot
at this moment so I'm gonna go ahead and
add just some really natural lashes but
I wanted to do a look where I'm not
doing a super complicated technique at
least I didn't think you know I wasn't
doing a cut crease or bring me on a
concealer or anything like that I wanted
to do something that was just a little
bit more similar trying to do a
different style or different technique
for each of the four different looks
that I'm doing so this one was kind of
my more simple but very like springy
yellow gold makeup look I actually
really like the way that it turned out
but I don't put the lashes on at the lip
color and I'll finish up with the third
palette I just added some lashes these
are from a Nakia Joy said in their
natural scent and these are very very
natural lashes but again like I said I
don't think that this look needs lashes
so I'm with a really natural pair for my
lip color I'm gonna use milk makeup and
cream one of my favorites lip colors and
I feel like it's a very like natural lip
color as well like a your lips but
better color and I feel like it would
just go with the whole vibes of this
makeup look hey guys so this is the
finished look with the third palette the
armed and gorgeous palette I really
really like this look like I said I love
yellow looks right now but I am loving
this one I tried to do this look similar
to the one that I had in my products
brands that I loved before getting PR
I'm just kind of funny more people as
mentioned in that one and my story of
getting the first jaclyn hill palace
it's kind of fun did kind of a similar
look in that video so I was trying to
recreate something like that but I love
these yellow tones I love that shimmer
was so pretty so I don't even know how
many ones I used one two three four five
six six again so I used six six shades
out of this palette and I am pretty
impressed as well again I tried to do
something pretty simple with this look
to show you how quick and easy it could
be again you can skip lashes and just do
a bunch of mascara like I did in that
video but I'm really impressed with this
one I'm so excited that that yellow
turned out to be more yellow than I
thought it was going to be I thought it
was gonna have a tinge of some orange in
it but it really was very yellow and
that has me so excited so that is our
third look let's move on to the final
palette pretty moving on into the fourth
and final palette this is bling boss and
this is the purple palette this palette
has me very excited this was the number
one palette that I was planning to
purchase
I love Purple's on the eyes I'm so into
pinks right now this one has some nice
pink tones in it as well and I am so
excited about this one so for this I
love and going to try to create a halo
eye I love doing halo eyes and we
haven't done one yet I'm really inspired
by the purple which is called Jem it's a
really cool metallic purple I'm really
inspired by that one but there's so many
colors in here that I'm so excited to
play with but I had that that kind of a
thought jump into my mind as soon as I
saw this palette which rarely happens so
fingers crossed let's go as well as your
like will you please and stop putting
concealer over me they hurt hopefully
they're still hooking up okay but okay
so for the halo eyes I really just jump
right into the halo I think that they're
super easy to do there's not a lot of
blending with them and that's why I like
them so much so first I'm gonna come in
with the shade gem this really cool
metallic purple and I'm going to build
that shade on the outer part of my eye
use any setting spray for this one I
might need to because it's going on a
little bit later than I anticipated but
also at the same time I don't want it to
be like to over well especially with
halo eyes you don't have to build up the
inner and outer fully right away
because I kind of come back after I put
in the center shape and I come back and
fill them up more and that sort of thing
so I'm just going to build that right on
the outer part I am getting a lot of
fallout with the shade so again spraying
the brush might help with the fallout
issue and I'm also gonna bring that
right in the inner corner of my eye I
honestly was super easy to build up I'm
going to go ahead and come back with
some concealer I was a little worried at
first but that took me no time at all to
build that shade up so that's awesome I
love the way it looks at a self purple
it looks so cool
okay so I'm just gonna put a little bit
of concealer right in the center of
where I put those purple shades so
something like that is kind of what I'm
going for the next I'm going to spray
just a small brush this is the inner
corner e46 from sigma and i'm going to
take ball z right here and place that
over the concealer I'm going to take my
time and completely cover the concealer
with the shade Ball Z then also kind of
blend that shade and purple together as
well so it should look at something like
this right now again I'm just gonna kind
of come back and forth I kind of build
up out here and in the inner corner and
then I'll add some more shimmer and I
just kind of go back and forth until I
get it to where exactly I like it but
I'm also going to clean up the fallout
and add some lashes wait my lashes are
still drying but I need to keep it
rolling because my camera is going to
die for the second time I wasn't
starting filming this add just a little
bit of purple liner to my waterline from
Urban Decay and then coming into the
palette I'm gonna grab off the shade
Rockstar and a pencil brush and I'm
gonna put that onto the lower lash line
ooh that's really pretty then I'm gonna
come in with the same up brush and I'm
gonna grab the second shade which is
hush and I'm just going to kind of blend
out that purple with this shade
now I'm going to grab a little bit of
Ball Z again with the same brush that I
applied it with and I'm gonna apply just
a tiny amount to the inner corner for my
lips I'm going to do something that I've
been doing quite a bit lately I'm going
to line and fill in my lips with just a
nude lip liner this is bully bear from
Mac and then I'm just going to go over
that with the new NARS lip balm in let
me say correctly orgasm I can't remember
if this was orgasm or super orgasm and
you can't mix those two up you know poor
lips are struggling a little bit after
three lip color changes but that is what
I'm going to do for my lipstick but
after that that's gonna do it for the
fourth and final look using the Jaclyn
hill of bulk collection with morphe so
here is the purple look that I came up
with I really really like this one I
love doing a halo eye I think it is so
easy this lashes not looking the best
but again for lashes it's been it's been
a long day guys so sorry about that but
I love this purple look so much that
purple the gem oh my gosh and the
shimmer in falsy I don't know how to
choose a favorite look at this point but
this is definitely up there and again I
love how purple looks with green eyes I
love the smoky lower lash oh I really
like this look so how many shades did I
use I think one two three four only four
out of this one halo eyes again super
simple you don't need a lot of Shadows
to pull off a look and I really really
like this I'm very impressed with the
purples in here that has me excited I
can't wait to play more with this one I
really like this one but after that we
got four looks with four pallets are
yeah so that is going to wrap up at
today's video doing swatches and a look
with each of the four new palace from
the Jaclyn hill and morphe vault
collection I hope that you guys enjoyed
this video I hope that you found it
helpful I'm going on our 5 filming
between having my camera heat up and
having to recharge it it's been a while
it's been a while here filming but I had
so much fun I had so much fun playing
with these pallets and coming up with
the different looks I really really hope
that you found this helpful let me know
what you thought I'd - down the comments
are you planning on getting all 4 are
you leaning towards just some of the
in the in the collection again you can
produce all four for $49 or individually
they are going to be $15 they will be
available on the morphe website on June
26 you know two if you have a favorite
look honestly I can't decide I I
actually really enjoyed them all I'm not
sure which one would be my favorite but
I'd love to know if you guys have a
favorite out of this one as well of
course this is a first impression this
was the first time I was putting
everything on my eyes but I have to say
I do find the quality to be the same as
the Jaclyn hill palette and so if you've
always wanted to try that palette but
maybe there's specific shades that you
wanted out of there and they correspond
to one of these palettes you could save
some money and get that I really had no
issues with blending by probably my
biggest issue I would say would be the
fallout and that is when I was using
those dark colors and again that's
pretty standard for me across the board
with my eye shadow palettes so based off
of first impressions what I recommend
these yes I would really recommend all
four I obviously I'm going to try them
out more I'll come back and give a full
review and just I just want to wrap this
up by saying thank you guys for watching
my videos and for following me and
supporting me because this was a really
really cool package for me to get and I
tried to get this video up as soon as I

that in PR I really wanted to be able to
come on camera as soon as I could and
maybe help you guys make a decision on
if you need these palettes which ones
that you want at cetera and I get these
packages and these opportunities because
of you guys so I'm really grateful for

want to wrap up the video without saying
