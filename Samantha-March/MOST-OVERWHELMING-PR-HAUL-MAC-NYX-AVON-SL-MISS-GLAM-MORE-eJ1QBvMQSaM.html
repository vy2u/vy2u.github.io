today's video is going to be a new PR
haul and I think the most overwhelming
PR haul I have to date this this video
to me I feel like I'm just going to
shift the whole video and I'm going to
try my best not to cry but you guys know
I get emotional very easily I feel like
I'm getting emotional just freaking
doing this intro that's a ridiculous
item so usually on Tuesdays I do a
livestream at 4 o'clock CST but because
today is the 4th of July and it's
Americans birthday I did a poll on my
Twitter to see would you guys want a
live video would you be around which we
are celebrating and the most people said
to not do the live stream because they
wouldn't be able to make it but I did
still want to put a video up mostly
because I am posting every single day
and I still have a huge list of videos
that I want to do and I don't think I
can fit them in even if I upload a video
every single day so I really didn't want
to lose Tuesday so I thought I would
just go ahead and film a regular video
and upload it a like normal but next
week I will be back with a live video at
4 o'clock CST check my Twitter because I
will do a poll of what you guys want to
see in that video like I said this is
going to be a PR haul my snapchat agreed
that they still would like to see the PR
haul and like I said it's just going to
be this is going to be an overwhelming
one so before we get started I want to
say thank you guys thank you for the
support thanks for watching my videos
for sharing for commenting just for
coming by I appreciate it so much I
understand fully that I'm getting these
packages because of the support of so
many people out there and it means so
very much to me if you do follow me on
snapchat I think that you see my emotion
is so overwhelming but I'm just very
thankful and very appreciative and
grateful for these opportunities and
grateful for these brains that are
noticing me so thank you guys so much I
appreciate it I appreciate you clicking
on this video if you have not subscribed
yet I hope that you will my 20k giveaway
is going on right now because I always
want to give back and show my
appreciation as well so that video will
be linked in the description box down
below but I want to go ahead and jump
into my latest PR hauls I did get a
package from Pixie Beauty pics
Beauty sends so many sweet packages they
are just like seriously like one of the
nicest brands and I've been so excited
because I found so many products from
them that I really love and adore so it
looks like they just sent a little card
along they send a shear cheek gel and
also a gel tint silk a lot so this is
what the packaging looks like and we
have all of the products in here so a
shear cheek gel there is what the
packaging looks like and then I want to
open one up and see what Steve's look
like this one is in the shade slush
these are oh okay that looks way darker
than I thought it would be that is in
the shade of Felicia so that's what they
look like that I think would be way too
dark on the way to right from the
Heritage so what's actually inside of it
or if those are the gel and then I also
sent along the gel tint and silk gloss
so here's what those look like these
ones are in the shades Beach tint oh
here is what the packaging looks like so
it looks like an interesting combination
of colors for sure but pixie can be
found at Target so I'll have a link down
below and then I also have the website
too so it was really nice to get a few
new goodies from Pixie they're a really
cool package from Pacifica Beauty so
this is like a little bag that it came
in with the unicorn on it so super cute
and then inside this is the stunning
brow eyebrow lost and set with coconut
health vitamin B and sunflower oil okay
so that sounds extremely interesting
this is super intriguing to me okay so
this is what the warm looks like it
looks just like a clear brow gel we have
the stellar gaze length and strengthen
mineral mascara and it says this also
comes with coconut and vitamin B
specific item we found I think they're
sold at Target too and also at Ulta
beauty so I'll have them linked and then
we have a blemish vanish concentrated
mineral correcting cream that's really
cool so that it's a color correcting
palette then a neutralizing mattifier
soft focused translucent powder with
cherry and coconut I will definitely be
giving that a shot we have the rainbow
crystals liquid mineral
it's a multi-use highlighter this is a
deeply devoted creamy color natural
lipstick this is the last thing with an
eyeshadow palette this is the pink nudes
coconut infused mineral eyeshadow so
there is an eyeshadow palette I think I
have a lot in here to create a pretty
decent love so I'm really excited to try
it all this from Pacifica beauty at
clinic thank you to Pacifica this
average was definitely very overwhelming
to get I have received a package from
Kevyn Aucoin in the past my ticket
another one was like oh I just kind of
like takes my breath away
when I get packages from Sandy's brands
it's just so insane but from Kevin a
Quan or I've heard recently it's coming
a quoi I believe is how you pronounce it
but from Kevin applaud this is the
contour book volume 2 the art of
sculpting and defining it did also come
with a like contour brush if you slide
it out and then here is the palette so
when you open it you have a little pages
here explaining how to contour and how
to highlight which i think is amazing at
the highlighting and sculpting and then
also the eye shapes and defining which i
think is really really close up that was
very interesting and then when you open
it up a little bit further you have the
mirror in here and then you have all of
these different shades and this just
looks like such an amazing value guys
know that I really am very much into
contouring and highlighting so we have
two cream products up here at the
sculpting cream and then the candlelight
cream and then these are two powders
against protein powder and candlelight
butter and then we have powder some here
that can be used on the face or the eyes
which I just think it's so cool I'm just
so
oh that's just really amazing really
excited again it's like I don't even
want to play with that I think it's so
beautiful I just want to like put it on
display or something but I'm definitely
going to be trying this out I'm very
excited about it so yeah this one was
really this one this one was pretty cool
couple items from actually to share as
well I've talked about ostomy a lot on
my channel it's basically a website that
connects platters and brands bloggers
can basically like apply to receive
products from certain brands in order to
review them within 20
days on their Instagram for YouTube
puffs the website listed down below in
case you're interested in signing up for
actually if you are a beauty blogger I
got is from Oprah cosmetics and I was
super excited to get this because this
is their new dat trio set I actually
mentioned this in a will I buy it a few
months back and I said that I was going
to buy it and I have had my eye on it
I've had it in my cart on the Oprah
website for a while and I hadn't done it
and then when I saw some available on
actually I was like please please please
like I've put together such a lengthy
proposal for Alfred ascend this to me
and I was so excited when they said that
they were going to I have done a full
lip swatch video on my Instagram so I'll
have that video linked down below on
March beauty word comes with the shade
Dubai this one was a little too Brown
gray on me it wasn't my favorite from
the trail it was so nice but it was
almost a little bit too gray I don't
know it just it wasn't my favorite
Manila which was their new shade I think
this one is my favorite it's between
Manila and bel-air but this one was just
such a gorgeous
nude I was wearing this one I think it
was in my Urban Decay Naked heat I
always have my makeup listed down below
in the description box there's a section
that says on me and then I have my eye
shadow or highlighter lipstick or lashes
or whatever it is and bel-air was a
really nice pink nude as well then
loving these took Manila with me when I
went out of town this weekend because I
loved it there very long-lasting very
comfortable very nice a liquid lipsticks
I was really happy to get these see
they're also available at Ulta Oprah is
now sold out Ulta online but I saw the
new trio specifically was on there too
so I'll have it linked down below but I
was so so excited to get those these
next items are both from Pier one is
their on point eyeliner you guys might
know that I love eyeliner and when I saw
this I was like really want to get it
this isn't a shade down to earth which
is brown I do have it in my waterline
today and then smudged a little bit on
my lower lash line I don't have any
shadows on my lower lash line this is a
really good eyeliner I really like pure
I've tried a lot from the raid I really
do like them I have a whole pure
cosmetics collection video that I can
leave link down below very creamy it's
very pigmented on the waterline it's not
something that I have to really work
with you know sometimes when you have
the gel eyeliners they just do not go on
line nothing shows up there shows up
right away and it's very long-lasting
it's not the most long-lasting eyeliner
I've ever tried but it's very very
long-lasting so I've been super
impressed with this and I keep reaching
for its other item I got from here is
some elections because I look for your
lashes and I can't like live without
them I don't have any lashes on right
now at the moment I just have some
actually have a pure mascara on I have
the pure big lash mascara on my lashes
right now but these are some lashes and
flirt I just got them so I still even
have the plastic on them and everything
but I have been loving peer lashes I
think they have six different styles if
you guys saw me on Instagram or if you
check my description box to see what's
on me and these in these YouTube videos
you will see that I am mostly tagging
peer lashes I am wearing something most
I find them super comfortable to wear
that very easy to put on
I love the bands because they're thick
enough that they're easy to work with
but they're spin enough that they look
natural on the eyes I don't need liner
with these lashes because the band can
blend in so easily I've been having the
best time with pure lashes that I am
that I got from actually this is from
YSL when I thought I was like oh I just
have to do it because it's a lipstick
and lipsticks are my weakness and why I
fell like are you kidding me that is so
cool that I'm able to test this out this
is one of their rouge shine lipsticks
and this is in coral I think coral and
then shade 41 Correll or coral but like
look at this amazing packaging are you
kidding me it kind of matches my nails
that's amazing I haven't even I just got
this so I haven't even done anything
with it yet I'm going to swatch it
because I don't know what it looks like
yet but oh okay okay okay so this is
very interesting so there is a swatch of
that so it's actually kind of a sheer
hint of color has like kind of like a
sheer gloss to it but it's not super
glossy but it's definitely not like
traditional traditional lipstick ooh
that is really interesting so that makes
sense the roush shine oh it even says in
the box
oil in stick off to see how it goes on
the lips how pigmented it is on the list
and then see how well it lasts
throughout the day but I actually kind
of like that a little bit more because
it's still bright but it's not like too
too bright but
we'll have to see how that works but of
course this packaging is freakin amazing
so you should make it oscillate and YSL
for this we have it one more item here
from oculi and this is again from kevin
a Quan so this is one where again the
Kevin of Kwan consular book was sent to
me from the Kevin Kwan brand they reach
out to me and asked if they could send
it to me and I was like oppa let's not
play games but with this one this was
available actually so again I had to
write a proposal decree to send it to me
but it is the meal highlighter when they
said yes
oh I would like no when I can't believe
they said yes I want to see but they
were so expensive I think it's like $68
I want to say I put it in a will i buy
it video once and I said the packaging
is beautiful and I would love to try it
but it's just too much money for me so
this is really amazing and it comes in
like super bougie packaging where you
have this like nice little black bag
that you slip off and then here is what
the outer packaging looks like you can
see my ring light in there and then when
you open it up so pretty oh my gosh I
just can't it is so pretty so there is
what that looks like so this is the meal
highlighter illuminator in Sahara which
is a golden rose glow so soft radiant
shades come together and this Universal
highlighter to create a natural luminous
glow okay so let's swatch it even though
I don't want to put my grubby fingers in
here so I don't know if you can tell the
greatest on camera but it kind of fades
so it's like two different colors so go
from the lighter and fades to a bit
darker so let's just go ahead and swatch
both sides oh that feels ah it feels
really nice oh they're so smooth those
were so smooth okay so that is just a
one finger dip in there they felt really
nice and feel really somewhat of course
I'll need to trade on my face to get a
good idea of it but I was so so excited
to get this I'm super excited to try it
out and just like just totally freaked
out that they agreed to send it to be so
those all the items that I received from
oculi um these brands a to review and
I'm just so excited for it
and actually link will be linked down
below and then I'll also link all of the
products that I mentioned as well in the
next item that I received home yeah and
I was so excited for I really didn't
think I was getting it and when I did I
was like are you kidding me it is the
beauty in the Beast collection from
lorac cosmetics they sent me the Pirates
of the Caribbean but I wasn't sure about
Beauty and the Beast and then I know
some people that the PR really early
like before even released and then I
thought other people getting PR later
and I was like oh I'm just not getting
it that's cool I was planning on picking
out the the cheek palette anyways I
talked about it in a way lay by it and
said I wanted to get it off planning on
buying it from Ulta and so when this
came I was like no way like I was I was
so excited about it but we have the
eyeshadow palette which was so cool
here is what the eye telltale looks like
I mean the packaging is just insane like
as the packaging is just freakin insane
and then you open it up like this and
then we have all the shades in here we
have a mirror there is a brush as well
but it promptly so I would haven't
watched it I haven't tried it out yet
I did ask on my Twitter and my snapchat
what you guys wanted to see and a lot of
people wanted to see a first impression
be actually putting it on in a video so
I think that is why I'm planning on
doing let me know what you would like to
see with the collection but as of right
now that's what I'm doing so I'm trying
to hold myself back from using this
until I some of the video but we shall
see we shall see what I think when I
actually put it on my eyes but let me
know what you'd like to see in that
video but then of course they also did
send along the cheek palette which I'm
so excited about because when they sent
the Pirates of the Caribbean collection
palette really got me it was so good and
I continually find myself using that
blush and those highlighters in there so
so so pretty oh my gosh they're just
like my shades man they're so gorgeous
so we have some blushes in here and then
a highlight which looks to be a pretty
gold highlight and then these beautiful
beautiful blushes I kind of watch maybe
there was two highlights and two blushes
instead of one highlight and three
blushes but hey that's okay that's fine
sometimes you just put it in but this
guy this has been really hard not to dip
into real hard and then they also did
sent along their lips
los and a lipstick set so I'm pretty
excited about that so this one is the
lipstick collection and it comes with
five different lipsticks and then also
the lipgloss collection which also comes
with five different lip glosses the
collection is also available now at Ulta
Beauty so I have it linked down below
huge thank you to lorac huge thank you I
love feeding the beast so this is so
amazing to have thank you and then
moving on I was so excited to get this
package you guys tell who it's from it
is from the beautiful SL mist glam oh my
gosh
so I mentioned her in my makeup wishlist
video I said that I really wanted to get
some of her brushes she is a youtuber
and she created her own makeup brush
line which i think is amazing I love
supporting girl bosses and entrepreneurs
and I have had her on my makeup wishlist
for such a long time and she actually
reached out to me on Instagram and she
said someone who watched my video let
her know reached out and said that she
wanted to send me a few things so when I
say that I'm so appreciative to you guys
because you honestly helped me get these
packages I mean this is just like it
just goes to show that is so very true
because I didn't reach out to her and
let her know one of you guys did or some
of you guys did and I am so appreciative
of that and look at how cute her boxes
are like she has the best packaging I
will have her link down below of course
I'll have her website linked down below
but she is just the cutest like most
beautiful person she's so bubbly and
positive and I just I love watching her
video but I thought it was very cool
because she spent a long summer lunch
items like her Beauty Blender until a
really cute pink Beauty Blender it's not
way to try that out she did also send
along this brush it is the one note they
el34 blend Beauty it does say it C on it
and I had heard on her snapchat that she
said one of her brushes is going to be
in an upcoming it C bag which i think is
amazing and so awesome for her so she
put that brush in there which I thought
was really really cool and then she also
sent along the unicorn love brush set
like look how adorable these brushes are
they are so beautiful and so girly and
just so very much Stephanie so I'm so
excited to use them and then she sent
along
it which I just thought no freakin way
they sent a long hurt heal glam brush
bug like that is so amazing that's so
like nice and generous of her I just oh
I just said it was so cool because
inside it is filled filled with brushes
I mean I just I just couldn't believe it
I just I really couldn't believe it look
at all of these beautiful makeup brushes
that I now get to play with if you guys
have been following me for a while help
impression you know that I am so
obsessed with makeup brushes I love them
I love buying them I mean I think
they're just so useful they're not
products that just like sit around and
go to waste I'm using my brushes every
single day so to be able to get
something like this and something so
beautiful the brush look I just was
completely blown away this was so nice
of her she definitely did not have to
reach out to me at all she didn't have
to send me this but it just my gosh it
means so very much to me so a huge thank
you to Stephanie atomic glam this
package was just so amazing so just
thank you I did want to say that she
sent a card as well and it does have
some discount codes on it these would
just be discount clothes for you not

little bit of money and I'm so excited
to test these bad boys out this package
I actually just received as well and
when I got it I was like that has a very
large box and then I open it I was like
oh my gosh what is this so it is from
Avon which is a so cool Avon was one of
the first makeup brands that I do this
because my mom used it so whenever I was
going to use my mom's makeup it was
always Avon so when I open it up I can
do this like oh my gosh this is so cool
it's a bunch of lipsticks but on it I'll
pick this out it says March Beauty word
on it which is my Instagram handle I was
like oh my gosh but it's so cool to get
something personalized
like obviously it made the cry because
duh everything makes me cry take it out
and like oh my word let's not spill
everything it's actually drawers of
lipstick I thought it was just like the
top rope
it is drawers of the Avon lipstick like
what even instant and it's super super
heavy someone put it down now oh but I
want you to see see how it says March
Beauty word I'm so cool like that was so
it's like the little things I swear but
there is so many lipsticks in here but
just wait there's more we just wait
there's more so many Avon lipsticks in
here I don't even know what to do or
where to begin
but a huge thank you to not only get all
these lipsticks but to give it such a
nice case have my name on it that meant
so much to me you guys like that's
really cool you know I'm obviously I'm a
smaller channel so I'm like not used to
all of this because I know other people
are just like oh cool this is what I got
I'm like really like really this is what
I'm getting it's so crazy to me so just
a really big thank you just a really big
thank you and thank you to Avon because
that was really very amazing I can't
wait to play with all these like I said
this just came so I haven't even really
been able to dig in yet but that's
amazing I also got a really cool package
from number 7 I have been loving on
number 7 I put them in in 7 brains I
think that you should try in 2017 and I
have just been so impressed with so many
of the products that I have tried from
them from their skincare to that makeup
just everything has been impressing me
so they sent me this really cute package
and then inside like look at how
adorable this presentation is are you
freaking like kidding me right now it is
so amazing and then each in each of
these little guys was a product I did
just post an Instagram video using this
so I'm kind of like went through
everything that will be up on my
Instagram soon much pretty weird of
course but it came with a hydrating mist
it came with an eye cream it came with a
primer it came with makeup wise and then
it came with a day cream and a night
cream like are you joking me and then I
can't wear one of those like beautiful
box I'm like well that was amazing so I
have number-7 link down below as well I
know it's sold at Target I have seen it
at Walgreens it's at Alta as well so
I'll have any links it down below but
I'm just so excited because I've been
loving on their skincare as much as
their makeup so really excited to get
some really good skincare too the last
two items these last two items I don't
even know what to say if you saw me on
snapchat you saw my reactions of getting
these and oh my word
so the first package is from NYX and it
just kind of came in a box and then I
put everything in a box but you couldn't
really see it like when I lifted it out
so I ended up putting it in a they
sent along 122 of their lipsticks they
sent along their full collection of
their matte liquid lipsticks of their
soft matte lip cream and then of their
liquid suede lip sticks and then also
their collection of their lingerie
liquid lipsticks like are you kidding me
I thought NYX NYX was one of like the
first brands that I was really getting
into when I started into makeup because
they were really nice product but they
were at the drugstore so they were a
little bit more affordable they were
some of the first lipsticks like the
soft matte lip creams are one of the
first like cool trendy lipsticks that I
bought and so to get the entire
collection and then three more
collections from Nick I literally like
just lost it I mean I just lost it
there's no other better way to say it
huge thank you to next like this is this
is insane to me okay this is insane to
me I can't believe this is happening I'm
doing I've obviously tried the soft
matte lip creams I mentioned them in my
top 10 liquid lipsticks have tried the
lingerie line which I really enjoy as
well I just heard out the liquid suede
last week and this week I'm trying out
the matte lips which is what I have on
my lips right now because I want to do a
full video reviewing each of the four
lines doing a couple of swatches but
obviously I'm doing giveaways
because who why would I keep 122
lipsticks it doesn't even make sense and
I've asked my snapchat for help and I
think I come up with some really fun
giveaway ideas so
be on the lookout for my next video
where I'll be reviewing swatching and
then announcing of some of the giveaways
because I'm a lipstick addict and a
lipstick hoarder but this is on a new
level so I will be giving some away and
then the final item that I'm sharing in
his PR hall was who this one was a
mind-blowing one I had no idea this was
coming
I who that's really all I can say I
opened the box install Mac and look at
this box this box is no joke and I
started to freak out because I was
seeing this box on other people's
snapchats and I thought no way why would
Mac send this to me this doesn't even
make any sense in it up and here's the
little Mac guy but then there is these
drawers see those four jurors and inside
the drawers are lip products like blush
a fist the second drawer again full of B
MAC lipsticks the third drawer in here
has a bunch of lip pencils and then
they're retro matte liquid lipsticks my
goodness this is so overwhelming to me
to just fill out these drawers and then
the fourth and final row has a bunch of
their lip glasses and then also a prep
and prime oh I honestly I honestly don't
know why I got this I don't even own a
lot of Mac like what makes I could kind
of understand because I am wearing
mix-a-lot I tagged them a lot on
Instagram but I really don't even have
that much Mac so I'm like how would I
select it for that I have I have no idea
but I'm so grateful I'm so grateful and
I'm just so overwhelmed I don't know
what to say I feel like I just keep
repeating myself in this video and I'm
sorry but I really am just super
grateful and just super appreciative
because this one was really really
mind-blowing so if that's just really
amazing again I want to do the same
thing that I have in mind for the Knicks
I want to be reviewing the different
types of products and lines in here and
then
I'm showing some swatches and then also
doing more giveaways as well because
again of course not only can I not keep
all these that's just ridiculous but my
giveaways are definitely always ways to
just give back and show my appreciation
review video and swatch video and
giveaway will come soon too so ah
so crazy so that's what we're ending on
this freaking giant mech box that I just
still can't even understand why it
happened after that Mac package is going
to do it for my latest PR haul Fidesz
