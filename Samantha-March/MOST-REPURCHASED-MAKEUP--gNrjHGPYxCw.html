today's video is going to be my most
repurchased makeup this idea was
inspired from JM Beauty 89 or Jessica
Braun I will leave her channel link down
below I love watching her videos I think
she's super relatable and I feel like
our content is like somewhat similar
like for people that like to talk about
makeup or not so much into like the
tutorial type of thing but we just like
to talk and chat about makeup so I've
just been like so obsessed with her
channel especially as of lately and she
did most repurchase makeup a couple
weeks ago and I thought what a good idea
what a good way to show people what we
really love and what we're actually
going out and rebuy I think that's a
really cool idea and I put this on a
Twitter pull I do Twitter pulls every
once in a while and ask you guys I give
you like three options and I ask you
what you want to see first and in my
most recent Twitter poll this was the
winner so I wanted to get it up as soon
as I could
so thank you guys for voting you can
always find me on Twitter app by
Samantha March and take the polls and
let me know what you guys want to see
video wise so thank you so much for
voting for that but what I'm going to be
showing you is my most repurchase makeup
and some of the things I have to show
are not only like I went out and
repurchase the exact same thing but some
of them like I have a lot of different
lipsticks and it's just you know that
lipstick formula that I really love and
so I have you know multiple different
colors in that lipstick of that type of
thing I also want to say like I
apologize if I seem like a total spaz in
this video or if my nose starts bleeding
I am recording this on Tuesday March 14
that my book comes out tomorrow the 15th
if you missed my will I buy a video I
talked about my book that is coming out
or that is already for sale by the time
this video goes up this is my fifth
novel defining her went on sale on the
15th so this is release day even I am a
freaking hot mess and I get stressed
nosebleeds and my nose keeps bleeding
and I'm just I'm it's it's a rough day
so there's that I'm defining her I'll
leave it link down below it's on Amazon
Barnes Noble and Kobo there's also a
giveaway to go along with it you can win
gift cards to Sephora Ulta Amazon all
that good stuff that'll be linked down
below but anyways why don't I go ahead
and jump into my most repurchase to make
up we're gonna start off with brows
because you know I love brows I always
you know do my brows in a regular basis
I'm very very much a brow gal straight
up lying to you right now
I didn't really understand that browser
like a thing until I got on YouTube and
that people get really angry if you
don't do your brows people are probably
gonna be angry at me today because I
don't have time to do my brows today I
just put some gimme brow some benefit
just like fiber gels stuff just through
that in my eyebrows and called it a day
so people always get really mad at me
when I do that that's just too bad I'm
not a brow person but I really actually
do like this brow product and it's from
benefit who's like the Guru of brows so
I first got a little sample size of the
goof proof brow pencil and it was when
they were coming out with their brow
launch relaunch all their brow products
I think they sound like everybody - like
Vegas or something my invite clearly got
lost that keeps happening and it's very
confusing to me but I got a sample of
this at Ulta and I loved it I thought it
was fantastic so I went out and got a
whole size I actually bought the kit and
that came with like the high brow I
think it came with like a setting gel it
came with the goof proof and I was
really excited about it leave it link
down below I don't know if the kids are
still always in stock I think they would
go out of stock really fast but if I can
find it I'll leave a link down below
otherwise I'll leave this down below as
well I goof proof brow pencil I thought
was really good the full size does have
the spoolie on the end it usually has
more of like a teardrop type of shape
except for when you use it a lot which I
have used this a lot so I don't know the
shape kind of goes away but I find it
really easy to use and like I said I'm
not a brow person I'm a brown newbie I
don't know what to do with my brows
imagine that because I got the sample
size and I thought it was so good I went
out and bought the full size so the goof
proof brow pencil from benefit this is
an eyeliner that I ever purchased
several times now this is from
Maybelline it's their master precise
eyeliner it's just a black liquid
eyeliner and this is what it looks like
I do have it on my eyes today and when I
was putting it on I was like I feel like
I haven't used this eyeliner in a while
and as I was putting it on I was like oh
because it's almost freaking out again I
think this is my third one and I'm
almost through it again if that tells
you how much I wear it and use it like I
just run these out it's Maybelline it's
drugstore it's affordable and I liked
the tip on it when I was like still like
really really practising my wings
I have no winged liner expert by any
means I still struggle with them but
this when I was like really starting to
learn and like
that time at night to be in front of my
mirror and practice the wing and wipe it
off and practice and wipe it off this is
what I was using that's probably why I
went through it so fast but I just found
it really helpful so if you're a wing
newbie this could be a good option for
you but like I said it's drugstore it's
really affordable I'll probably keep
repurchasing it just because it's kind
of like so it's like my fallback if I'm
not feeling confident in like my other
pens or my gel liners like this is the
one that I typically reach for it
so more eyeliners I love eyeliners guys
I'm not gonna lie I know a lot of people
like always pass over eyeliners or like
don't talk about them
I love eyeliners but more eyeliners that
I absolutely love are the color pop gel
pencils obviously these are very much
repurchase and very loved
I bought um I think I bought like these
two the first time crybaby which is
lavender and maybe which is green and I
was like these are like the best freakin
eyeliners ever and I bought more and
then kathleenlights came out with mr.
Bing in a collab I bought that I love
these liners these are so good they're
like five dollars five or six dollars
they're super affordable they stay even
in the waterline all day I can put these
on in the morning and then I actually
have to take my makeup remover wipe and
wipe out my waterline otherwise they do
not come off they stay so well these are
some of the best eyeliners that I've
ever tried for the waterline I don't
think they're good for making like
winged liner or anything like that like
sometimes I use them on my top eyelid
and just kind of like do something funky
with it but if you want like a precise
weight it's not gonna happen with these
but especially for your waterline these
are so good they have a huge variety of
colors I love these so I have a couple
of eyelashes that are just like faves
faves
um one for sure is definitely like the
art doll lashes I repurchase our doll
lashes like crazy I really do like the
one 1/3 lashes I bought those recently
and I really liked them or just any of
their whispies I really like I do tend
to repurchase them quite a bit
so I wanted to throw those out in here
but the other two that I repurchase a
lot one is the Vegas nay and i lure
grande glamour lashes these lashes are
very like I think wait I have another
box
hold on I know I have a new box they're
not kidding when I say our repurchased
means a lot because here is a new box I
already have one ready to go for one my
other lashes bite the dust I got my
backup pair ready these are very
glamorous very valve a loom the band I
know people say i lure bands can be hard
to work with they can but if you get
used to them and especially if you wear
them a handful of times they get much
easier to put on but the grand glimmers
I love them and then the other pair of
lashes I have to talk about are from
huda beauty
they are the Samantha lash duh it was
the first ever v IV sale from Sephora
that I actually like shopped it and I
picked up these lashes and became
immediately obsessed with them I think
this is like my second or third pair I
know I got a pair in the extravagant I
set from Sephora as well it came with
the Samantha lashes
I just loved these lashes I think
they're fantastic they're wispy and
they're long and they're full but
they're not heavy on the eyes the band
is much easier to work with they are
expensive though they're 20 bucks for
your lashes but they do last a long time
they really do and I wear them a lot
like I wear the crap out of them until
they literally like are disintegrating
and then I get a new pair but who does
meant the lashes are some of my
favorites being along I have two
concealers that I have been repurchasing
for years and years the first is I think
my like og first concealer that I ever
bought it's the Maybelline instant age
rewind I know so many of you guys have
probably heard about this I'm sure many
of you guys probably use this I love
this I have no idea what number this is
for me
I have no clue and if you can see I'm
more than halfway out of this one and I
will totally repurchase this so this is
what the applicator looks like it's just
so different from anything that I've
ever used but I love it and especially
days--or like I didn't get enough sleep
hashtag Tillett savings time got me so
messed up I keep finding myself reaching
for this like it is when you have the
dark circles and you need help this is
what I go for other one is also from
Maybelline and again you guys probably
have heard and use this one this is the
Maybelline fit me I love this concealer
this is probably at least my fourth one
if not even more I have
using this so much and it was because I
loved the instant age rewind so much
that when I was looking for a new
concealer to try and get more variety in
my collection I was like well I want to
stick with Maybelline and I just love it
I mean these concealers are both so
talked about I know a lot of people use
them and I will continue to repurchase
them next one is a product that I feel
like I've talked about so much I believe
I mentioned it in my ride-or-die I've
mentioned it in favourites videos oh my
gosh I just I mean you guys know it is
the pure 4 in 1 pressed powder I love
this stuff ok so obviously a huge dent
out of this one I already have another
one this is not my first one this is not
my second one I started buying this in
college which I'm turning 30 next week
so I've been to college in a hot minute
but this is one that I absolutely love
and I know I talk about it so much and
it's really exciting because I get snaps
from you guys letting me know that you
tried it out so you know so many people
already snapped me like now just fell
from our room and it's like have you
guys sent me to let me know that this is
going to be in the auto 21 days of
beauty I've also been getting snaps and
questions asking me if I'm doing another
Ulta 21 days of beauty video yes
it is coming very very soon and yes this
is one of the featured items in all the
21 days of beauty so this will be a
great time for you guys to try it out if
you haven't yet but I love it a great
powder I use it so often a mascara that
I have purchased several times over is
from benefit is the roller lash mascara
I'm not a really big mascara person
because I wear false lashes so much but
I mean I definitely don't wear false
lashes on a daily basis and sometimes if
I just want it quick you know five
minute makeup look I'm not gonna mess
with lashes and adhesive and all that
stuff and the roller lash is the one
that I know for sure that I have
repurchased this several times like I've
gotten sample sizes of it like deluxe
sizes of it and I've still gone on to
repurchase the full size
I just really like this mascara it makes
your lashes much longer I won't say that
it does much for volume which sometimes
I wish it did but definitely for length
like it just does amazing things this is
what the wand looks like this is a very
well known product again I would say
from benefit and it's just really good
like I'll continue to repurchase the
roller lash and I find myself reaching
for it so much so my next item is from
wet &amp;amp; wild it's the mega Glo contouring
palette and mine is in dulce de leche
now this is a repurchase for me because
my first one I actually shattered it I
was traveling I must have dropped my
makeup bag but it completely shattered
and I ran out immediately like probably
within two days and got myself a new one
so I wanted to include it in here
because that definitely meant a lot to
me when I broke something and I was like
I can't not have this in my collection
must have another one it's one well
that's super affordable I think it's
like five dollars and the pan sizes are
huge I love both sides of it the setting
powder is super brightening and I love
the contour powder it's like natural but
with a boost like I just I love this
thing I could not not have this in my
makeup collection so I have some items
here from colour-pop color pop when I
first made my order with them one of the
first things that I purchased was a
blush and it was interesting to me
because I'm not a big blush person and I
actually haven't heard a lot about the
color pop blushes but for whatever
reason if I was placing my very first
color pop order I ordered between the
sheets which is a blush it's eight
dollars I think it's a pretty good size
for a blush you do get a lot of product
and if you can see I have made a
considerable dent in between the sheets
it's a really nice everyday natural pink
color and I enjoyed the blush so much
that and another color pop purchase I
purchased quarters which is another
blush this is like my go-to fall blush I
absolutely love it because it's more of
like a terracotta type of shade and I
just think it's beautiful like go to
fall and winter blush is quarters from a
color pop I absolutely love it and the
the formula for the color pop blushes is
kind of like their super shock shadows
where it's almost like kind of wet
feeling more almost like like the moosie
type of texture it's really interesting
so I definitely for the blushes I
recommend like dual fiber brushes I
think those are the best
yeah the colour-pop blushes I don't feel
like a lot of people talk about them but
I really like them a foundation that I
just was so obsessed with and I bought
myself multiples of the same foundation
in different shades is the Maybelline
fit me I was like so obsessed with this
foundation I bought it in the shades 225
and 230 honestly I don't even know it
was one like myself tan shade and one
was neither shake I really have no idea
cuz they look pretty darn similar to me
so who knows what I was thinking because
this was like one of my like first found
like real foundations that I was
purchasing so who the heck knows what
was going through my head but I love
this and I know this is probably like
older packaging I think they have like
newer fit me packaging now because
sometimes when I use this people are
like what is that foundation that's not
what it looks like but I've had it for a
while but I still really love it and I
love the fit me line so much when they
came out with the matte and poreless I
was like yeah I'm gonna buy I'm gonna
buy that too so I did this one I don't
like as much as this one because I think
it's cuz I'm not like super oily so I
don't really need like matte matte
foundations except for in the summertime
they definitely do benefit me but once I
realized applying this with a damp
Beauty Blender would be like magical I
definitely did use this more though it's
not a great match for my skin tone but
that's okay I can I can still I can
still make it work but the Maybelline
foundations
I really enjoyed obviously I loved the
fit me line very much that I had to go
out and have three of these but again
it's my plane it's affordable it's okay
Maybelline is obviously one of like my
favorite brands from the drugstore I
have so much from them but the
Foundation's foundations got me I'm
going to end this with lippies is such a
lipstick addict and I try to pick out
what I knew I repurchase from sometimes
when I buy things I purchased like two
or three at a time I mean I was going
through my lipstick I'm like yeah I
purchased all those together I haven't
necessarily repurchased them if you know
what I mean but I have three different
brands to talk to you about the first
one is color pop this is not even all of
my color pop these are mason jars full
of colour-pop lippie Xand
not all of my collection it's really
disturbing
I like their lippie stix I think they're
okay I only have two I purchased them
together and I haven't repurchased
another one but they're ultra statins
and they're ultra mattes I have
repurchased many many many times over I
do lately I prefer the ultra satin lip
so I think they're just a little bit
more comfortable but they're still super
long wearing but they have a new ultra
matte formula out
I've been trying some like I tried one
from their holiday release and then
they're like weekly release they came
out with like Monday through Sunday
lipsticks and I got Sunday and I really
like that ultra matte shade so the ultra
mats are still good but yeah these are
definitely some of my most repurchase
lipsticks like when it's only six
dollars per lipstick it's kind of hard
not to do right another lipstick formula
that I just absolutely love and I
repurchase many many times is from
Maybelline I have a lot of Maybelline
lipsticks I don't think this is
everything either I think I have another
like little jar with some Maybelline
lipsticks but I love the Maybelline
lipsticks when people ask me for a good
lipstick formula from a drugstore it
like a regular lipstick not a liquid
lipstick not a lip gloss not a matte
lipstick anything like that just like a
regular good ol lipstick from the
drugstore I say Maybelline
I love these lipsticks I've been wearing
them for so long I constantly recommend
them I wear truffle tees on like a
sickening basis I wear this thing so
much and then also clay crush this is
actually one of their like more of their
math formulas still really good it just
dries matte it's not like
non-transferable or anything like that
it transfers it's more of like a regular
lipstick it just has a matte finish but
still so good I was wearing touch of
spice in one of my previous videos and
everyone was asking me what I was
wearing is touch of spice and then I
have some deeper lipsticks here as well
I love the Maybelline lipsticks I think
they are so good I always recommend them
and clearly I love them the last items
that I want to talk about for my most a
repurchase makeup is the NYX soft matte
lip creams I love these things and I
reach for them so much they're a soft
matte lip cream exactly what they say
they're like a liquid lipstick but it's
much more comfortable on the lips
they just feel nice like when you
apply them you think look this pillows
nice and soft exactly what the name says
but I just love the formula so much that
clearly I have gone out and bought and
bought and bought I think the very first
one that I ever bought was London which
is a great nude and I have actually
repurchased this this is my second
London that's how much I love it
I have Abu Dhabi because desi Perkins
told me to buy it and I said okay girl
I'm gonna buy it
I have Milan which is a bright pink I
have San Paolo which is a deeper pink
and then I have Rome which is like a
deeper burgundy I will continue to
repurchase the NYX soft matte lip creams
like a lot of times if there's like a
sale or something with NYX like buy one
get one half off or something like that
there's always something from NYX that I
want and then if I can't find another
thing I just throw in another soft matte
lip cream like why not like it let's
just do another one this is like
seriously one of my favorite formulas
and I think these are more affordable
like NYX has the lip lingeries those are
a little bit more expensive but the soft
matte lip creams I don't think are a bad
price you can usually find some sort of
sale especially at like Ulta or maybe
even like your drugstores if they carry
NYX but I love the soft matte lip creams
