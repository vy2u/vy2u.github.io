today's video is going to finally be
another part of my makeup collection
series and I am going through my blushes
if you guys can't tell I don't have a
huge blush collection and I say a lot in
my videos especially my will I bite
videos that I'm not a big like blush
addict and you can probably tell from my
small blush collection that I was not
lying so I'll just go ahead and go
through each blush and kind of give my
opinion about it talk about it a little
bit and then we'll be out of here hope
you enjoy seeing my blush collection
first one that I have is from Becca
cosmetics this was in collaboration with
Jaclyn hill it's the champagne glow face
palette so inside this is what it looks
like it has a big mirror as well these
two are highlighters but these top three
are all blushes it goes rose ice Britt
amaretto and this one is like
Pamplemousse I believe I don't know how
well you're gonna be able to see it
because of the glare ended up really
getting a lot of use out of the first
two rows a spritz is a really beautiful
like peachy pink blush with some shimmer
in it I especially loved it in the
summer time Anna red oh is just like
that staple everyday neutral blush I
honestly did not think I would like that
when I first saw the palette but it's
become one of my favorite blushes I
reach for it all of the time overall I
was super happy to get this purchased I
believe the entire thing was $54 I'm not
sure if these are still in stock I
thought maybe they were coming back for
the holiday season but then I didn't see
much after that but they aren't stuck I
can leave them link down below you have
some split pans as well that has like
blush and highlights the highlights in
here are champagne pop and Prosecco pop
champagne pop you can buy separately
Prosecco pop you can only get in here or
a split pan there is a Prosecco pop and
amaretto split pan it's actually in my
giveaway right now if you guys haven't
seen my best of beauty 2016 giveaway I
do mention this was like a favorite of
2016 so I purchased the split pan to put
into my giveaway but I'll leave that
link down below but yeah overall super
happy with this purchase and two out of
the three blushes the other one is just
a little too bright and too pink for me
I need to be really tan to wear that I
have the Tarte cosmetics and styled by
her Rouge palette now this is mostly in
a shadow palette you can see the six
eyeshadows right here
but it does also come with this blush
and cheeky and this blush I think is
super super beautiful it's a really like
light peachy shade there's no shimmer to
it it's actually really more of like a
neutral blush and did I hit pan but I
hit pan on the blush but I think that's
just like some Sparkle from this shade I
about died but I love this blush this
entire palette this is also in my best
of 2016 giveaway we got this palette was
such a staple and I took it so like
everywhere with me not only for the
eyeshadows but also for the blush and
the smear so check that giveaway but
this blush I thought was really
beautiful too overall this is just a
great palette I believe it is still in
stock so I'll leave it link down below
say blush and highlight trio from
Smashbox this was sent to me from
Smashbox it does have a mere inside as
well inside each of their blush and
highlight trios comes with two blushes
and then also a highlight shade I really
like these trios and I don't feel like
they are talked about enough again I did
not realize that this would be like this
but this is also gonna be in my best of
2016 giveaway as well strange okay
but I don't think that these get talked
about enough and I think they are really
good I used one in my latest I think it
was my simple and classic holiday glam
makeup look maybe I can't remember I
think maybe I used it in that one but I
just think these are super super
beautiful but the blushes are super
pigmented the highlight shade is really
beautiful as well I just think they're
lovely they have a maybe like three or
four different options and these trios I
think they're really good so these will
be linked down below as well and then I
do have this elf blush palette so hello
so inside you do have three different
blushes and then I actually use this as
a bronzer some people have said that
they use it as a blush themselves I
think it just is gonna depend on your
skin tone for me it actually works
really well as a bronzer these three I
do use as blushes these two I use the
most often this one in particular what I
have a good pan going on but this is a
shade that I reach for a ton I don't do
this one quite as often because it does
have shimmer in it if you can see the
shimmer to it so I don't reach for that
one quite as often but this one
definitely and the bronzer I use so so
often these little blush quads are
really affordable you can get in my
drugstores and I think I got this one at
Target so I know that they had
different options as well this one is in
light so I can try to find some and
leave them in the description box as
well so this is from Benefit Cosmetics
it's the dandelion blush so inside with
all their blushes and I believe the
bronzers as well it does come with their
own little brush and it has this let the
brush sits on and then inside is
dandelion it has a little mirror too but
honestly the the mirror doesn't work
great but this is the dandelion blush it
is a super light pale pink it actually
says on the box that you can use it as
like an all-over face shimmer to give
you a little bit of glow it's a little
bit too pigmented for my skin tone to be
able to use all over but it is a really
nice just very subtle light pink blush
when I want some color on my cheeks but
nothing too wild I will go for this one
and I just think it is really really
beautiful I know the dandelion gets a
lot of good attention from benefit and I
would say for a good reason but you do
need to have the right skin tone in
order to be able to wear it and for it
to show up on you
so this one is show me your cheeks is
from Elizabeth ma I believe this was
sent to me in an Ipsy bag I think maybe
like my first tip see bag it's a really
pretty peachy pink blush as well it's a
really nice shade it's not one that I
reached for a ton and I wish that I did
I think I need to like leave it out more
in order to be able to see it otherwise
I forget and I like reach for my palette
so often but this was a really nice
blush I'm familiar with the brand
Elizabeth matte but I thought it was a
nice blush and I really like peachy pink
blushes with some shimmer in it
especially in the spring summer love
them and then these two are both from
colour-pop this first one is in quarters
so this one in quarters it's definitely
more of a neutral blush but it has a bit
of like a kick to it like a bit of like
a deeper tone to it I find myself
reaching for this one a lot in the fall
I really do like color pop blushes they
are eight dollars a piece I believe the
two that I've tried which was actually
the first thing that I ordered from
colour-pop was blushes and lipstick
which is really funny and I really got
along well with the blushes and this one
is in between the sheets and I believe I
have hit pan on this one
and looks like there's you know some
left our brush residue in there what do
you do have a light
pink shade it's not like super pale I
would say it still shows up really good
on the cheeks but it's just a nice like
basic pink shade and I've reached for it
a lot obviously as you can tell I've hit
pan in it it really is one of my
favorite blushes so it's just really
good for like every day so that one is
in between the sheets except I have two
Milani blushes is in Dulce pink it's a
really nice pink shade with some shimmer
to it it is a little bit bright I don't
reach for it a ton because if you aren't
careful you can kind of go overboard
with the pinkness but still a really
nice blush my first Milani blush that I
ever purchased and then of course I had
to get this one this is Milani Luminoso
it has like a cult following here on
YouTube this was definitely mentioned in
my youtube made me buy a video just a
gorgeous peachy shimmery blush it's
gorgeous it's beautiful I wear it so
often everybody loves this blush if you
don't have it yet you gotta get a
luminoso from Milani then I just have it
two left
this one is from Sigma and it's really
hard to open
okay got it it does come with a nice
mirror and this one is in Core DeRosa
their aura powders which is blushes this
is a really nice neutral blush it
reminds me a bit of amaretto from Becca
and Jacqueline it's kind of like that
neutral blush but it has a bit more of
like a terracotta feel to it it's
beautiful it is super pigmented you do
not need to use a lot of this blush or
you will easily go overboard again this
is another product that I don't think
gets enough hype and I think it is so so
good so Core DeRosa from Sigma is a good
one I'll leave it link down below the
last one I have in my collection is from
one wild it's one of their ombre blushes
and this one is in might I buy you a
drink this is actually really similar to
Milani Luminoso except I think it has
more peach to it
you can see kind of the ombre effect
here but I was typically swirl my brush
all around in it I don't care so much
for the ombre but I like the effect that
it gives it all your brush through it
all this again I think is just beautiful
I love it again especially in spring and
summer but you know not even just that
this is such a good like everyday type
of blush it give
the cheeks a pop of shimmer as well like
maybe that day where you're not feeling
highlight I struggle a lot with texture
so I can't wear a highlight every day
this gives enough shimmer to me that I
think it looks still really beautiful so
I definitely want to pick up more of
these ombre blushes I know there's a
couple different shades as well and it's
fun wild so it's super affordable but
might I buy you a drink is a fave that's
gonna be everything a for my blush
collection I hope you enjoyed seeing it
like I said I'm not a huge blush person
and I have enough blushes enough
different shades to last me by so I
still hope that you enjoyed seeing my
blush collection and hearing a little
bit about each of the blushes that I
