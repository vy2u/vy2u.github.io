I'm really excited for today's video
because I have an announcement to make
and then you give away to share and just
all sorts of good things but today is a
really exciting day for me because on
Tuesday November first I am releasing a
new book so I'm really excited about it
I wanted to share with you guys over
here I have a giveaway to go along with
the release and book sales to go along
with it and I've just I'm really excited
I've been looking forward to this day
for such a long time if you are new to
my channel welcome if you do not know
yet that my actual career is that of an
author that I'm here to let you know
that is what I do I write books that's
what I do for my full-time job I am
really excited for this release it is
actually a holiday novella so it's much
more of a shorter story and it takes
place during the holiday time of course
it is called the Christmas surprise it
is by me Smith March you can find me on
Amazon my links will be down below for
the Christmas surprise and all of my
other books as well and so like I said
I'm really been looking forward to this
day for a long time because it's
actually been over two years since I put
out my last book and that is just too
long it's just way too long at what time
to have in between my books but I'm
excited to say the Christmas surprises
out today and my fifth book which I'll
have more information on shortly my
fifth book will be out in january and i
am currently writing book six now slan
to get back on track and get a lot more
books put out there because writing is
what I love doing it's it's just it's my
passion it's been my dream since I was a
little girl to be able to write books
and so the firts for me to be able to do
it full time is just such a really
special thing for me but very very
excited and happy that today is finally
here so the Christmas surprise it was
actually released last year and it was
released in a Holiday Collection so it
was a part of a holiday collection with
three other stories I decided to
re-release it on its own this year
because the collection was put out by
publishing company marching ink but
marching think actually closed and the
books that we had with marching ink they
actually the rights went back to those
authors and the authors have since tree
published their books as well for
themselves my books obviously have stuck
around I'll keep writing new books but
there are collection since it was a part
of the marching in collection that
collection did have to be taken down the
authors have also republished their
holiday novellas again their own
individual novel so I can leave those
linked down below is you need to get
your holiday reading list put together
but that's why I decided to release it
on its own you know it's still even
though it's a shorter novella it still
took me a lot of time and energy and
effort to write it and then you know get
it published so I wanted it to still be
out there so that's why I have decided
to re-release it on its own will be
exclusive to Amazon so the Amazon link
will be down below and it's only 99
cents so if you have an extra dollar to
spare and you would like to purchase the
Christmas surprise and support me that
would be so incredible I know my channel
is mostly a beauty channel now it
actually originally started as a book
channel and kind of turned over into the
beauty channel but I still do talk about
books every single day on my blog
chicklet plus and you know a lot of my
facebook and twitter too i have a
separate chiclet Plus accounts for them
too and books are just the books are
just my thing I love reading I love
writing and I've been really excited
because so many people that are
subscribed to my channel or my Instagram
or on my snapchat it seems like you guys
get excited about the books too even
though your main focus is beauty or your
channel is beauty or that's why you tune
in is to see the tutorials and the
reviews and the halls that you still get
excited when I say that I'm putting
books out it really is just so cool I
had an idea one night I was going
through the last rounds of getting the
novella ready and I thought wouldn't be
kind of fun to run a contest for my
snapchat and just see like when anyone
want me to rename some of these
characters after you guys and I said you
know go to my Instagram photo and leave
this emoji if if you wanted and you know
i'll pick whoever
spawns and I honestly I thought maybe
like three people would leave the emoji
cuz i was like no one cares about my
bugs like no one's going to be excited
about it that's not what they're here
for that's not why they follow me and
the response on that was so overwhelming
and it kind of made me think you know
like wow people aren't just watching me
for the makeup and the beauty they're
actually supporting me that was such a
cool feeling so thank you guys I'm going
to be doing it again with the book
number five once it gets back from
proofreading I'll run a contest again on
snapchat and since I'm currently writing
book 6 i'm going to be doing these
contests frequently while i write the
book i've already done one as i'm
filming this video i'm going to be doing
them along the way as i find new
characters to bring in and I'm like not
really sure what to name them I'm
heading over to my snapchat and naming
them after you guys so I just want to
thank you guys so much for the support I
just continues to blow my mind every day
that you guys seem excited about my
books and I I just can't say thank you
enough but how I did want to say thank
you was putting together I give away you
guys know that I'll of Giveaways I've
left giveaways before i start at youtube
I used to do weekly giveaways on my blog
chicklet plus and I just am so thankful
because this is my full-time job and
this is what I've done for so many years
I know that your support means
everything and when I say everything I
mean everything so if there is ever a
chance that I can do a giveaway and I
can give back I will do it because I
just want to keep saying thank you and
keep saying that I never take this for a
granite to be able to come from lawyer I
did and to now say that I work for
myself and I work full time chasing my
dreams is amazing and I couldn't do it
without you guys but on that note I do
want to jump into the giveaway and kind
of explain what i'm going to do because
this is going to be a pretty different
giveaway i hope it runs smoothly i have
no idea how this will go i hope it runs
smoothly but well I wanted to do
something fun and something kind of
different I've never had a book release
since I've started my youtube channel so
I thought what could I do to make this
fun so I have
a stack of prizes right here then I'm
going to let you guys know one winner
will win all these prizes but that's not
a way will be open for a month and
throughout the month on my snapchat i'm
going to show you guys more prizes that
that one winner will get I thought of
this idea because I wanted to
incorporate something with the title the
title is the Christmas surprise and I
thought I should put a surprise give
away together as well but I didn't want
it to just be like surprise you'll get
this in the mail I want you guys to be
able to see it too and I thought why not
incorporate my snapchat this way because
honestly like you guys are the ones that
I turn to I show when I'm writing i
bounce ideas off you up naming
characters after you I just thought what
a cool way maybe to be able to do this
so every few days throughout the next
month I will show new prices on snapchat
and they'll only be up there for 24
hours i'm not going to show them again
once those price is already shown on
snapchat third you shown so if you miss
it within those 24 hours and you win
you're just going to be surprised same
as f if you don't follow me on snapchat
or you don't have snapchat you'll still
win all of these but then you'll win a
surprise as well like you'll just you'll
just be surprised and I'm really excited
for that purple mei pin to what you'll
actually know you can win and then I'll
kind of happen to the surprises as well
so just real quickly to go over
everything you'll win a NYX jumbo eye
pencil in Kashmir you will win a
smashbox brow tech shaping powder this
is in taupe would win the maybelline
color tattoo I chrome in the shade
electric emerald thought that would be
like a fun kind of holiday color maybe
you will win the brow gel by Tanya
crooks it's a dummbell it's a
double-ended shimmer matte highlighter
pencil also be winning the Milani bella
cappuccino eyeshadow i really like these
eyeshadows i think they're really nice I

on eggshells trio this trio is like
everybody still talks about this trio so

thought that would be fun for holiday
giveaway then you'll win a duo this is
from Tarte it's there TARDIS slip
wardrobe so it comes with two different
lippies in there and then one winner
will also get the sweets glow kit from
anastacio Beverly Hills I have to do
full disclaimer here though it is a
broken pellet are new to my channel i
actually purchased one of these for a
giveaway and it came broken and they
send me another one they sent me four
pallets in total and they all came
broken and then i just gave up because i
was getting ridiculous but i have sent
to other ones out to winners and they'd
used the rubbing alcohol on them and
said it was no problem and it was
totally fine so i still had this one
laying around so i thought what better
time to add it to a giveaway but i did
just want to let you guys know you'll
have to do some like DIY on it but one
winner will also get the sweets glow kit
from anastacio so again those are the
prizes that you guys will know about so
for the surprise prizes like i said
throughout the month i will be sharing
on my snapchat the next prizes and in
case you guys are wondering i wanted to
like let you know what to expect but
since this is surrounding a book release
there will obviously be some books in
there as prizes but also because I'm a
makeup and beauty channel there's
obviously going to be lots of makeup
involved lots of beauty involved there
is going to be some fashion involved of
course they're all will also be like
home decor and holiday decorations since
the book is also a holiday release and I
like to shop for home decor especially a
target expect to see some of that in
there as well and then one of the like
the most given gifts I think that I give
out in the holiday season does that
sometimes make any sense but one of the
gifts that i purchased the most for
people because it's so quick and easy
especially when you have a family who
lives out of state from you it's gift
cards so get ready for these gift cards
so i'm super excited so i'm actually
still in the
those of getting everything ready
together but i will start sharing like
within the next two days here i'll show
you the i will just share it continually
every couple of days or so I'll just hop
on snapchat I will show you the next set
of prizes so you know but also when I
share the price for that day I will also
share a secret way to get bonus entries
so I always do bonus entries for my
snapchat fam and any giveaway that I do
so I thought with this one each day that
I've showed the set of prizes I will
also show a bonus entry for it and so
you guys know every single time that i
showed the surprise snap will also show
a bonus entry in there as well so you
get extra bonus entries into the
giveaway so you can win everything that
i just showed you and on top of that
home decor holiday decorations fashion
books makeup beauty gift cards i wanted
to make this one just kind of really fun
and special because like i said writing
books as my full-time career so when you
guys support me in that way it really
means like everything to me so i wanted
to put together just something really
fun and exciting but also interactive
with you guys as well I realized when
doing the snapchat contest like how much
fun I had doing that so I wanted to make
it interactive too so if you guys like
this idea and if it goes smoothly we can
always try it again one book five
releases in January as well but we will
see how it goes I will also leave the
