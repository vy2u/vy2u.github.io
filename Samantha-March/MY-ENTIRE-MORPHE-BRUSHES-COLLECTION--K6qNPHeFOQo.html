today's video is going to be a new part
of my makeup collection series I'm going
to be going through my entire morphe
brushes collection so I've been doing a
makeup collection video every single
month last year I was going through my
makeup collection my foundations
concealers blushes eyelashes this year I
started a new part of the series where
I'm going through certain brands I've
done P R and Sigma and color pop and
tart and last month in Turks video a lot
of people voted on seeing my morphe
collection and I thought that was going
to be a fantastic idea
I love morphe and I purchased a lot from
them as you are going to see video is
going to be pretty similar to like my
Sigma Beauty video where I do have a
good amount of makeup for more Tabas and
I do have a lot of makeup brushes if you
guys know me if you follow me on
snapchat you know that I have a serious
makeup brush problem I love makeup
brushes I just do so I have a lot of
them from morphe I love Morgie because I
feel like it is a very affordable brand
yet they always seem to have a really
good quality whether it's with their
makeup or with their brushes I just find
myself really liking a lot of what I get
from morphe so I'm super excited to show
you guys my collection will have their
website listed down below and then I
will list everything that I mentioned in
this video and link everything that's
going to take me a while but it will all
be in the description box down below as
well as what's on my face but I'm
wearing all that stuff that's always in
the description box this is not a
sponsored video I do not have a coupon
codes with morphe though I wish I did
after you've seen my collection you
probably know why it just really is on
my favorite brand and I really do enjoy
purchasing from them again
disclaimer as this is my third video I
believe that I'm filming it since I got
a wisdom tooth extracted so still a
little swollen on the side of my face my
voice is still not completely back to
normal because I can't unhinge my jaw
all the way and yes the right side of my
tongue is still numb and it's been one
week hoping we regain some sensation
back in there because it's a really
weird feeling to only be able to feel
half of your tongue but if my voice
sounds a little bit different or just
I'm talking slower that is why I'm still
definitely in
remote from that procedure it was a
doozy but why don't we go ahead and get
started with my morphe brushes makeup
collection the first thing that I want
to talk about are my palettes that I own
from morphe I want to start with the
original 35 palette that I purchased
which is the 35 T if this isn't in the
very first morphe brushes order that i
purchased it was in like at least the
second one because I got this so long
ago this palette is just beat up because
I loved it a lot of people were raving
about the three sides Oh at the time but
it's always out of stock I could never
get it and so I finally went with the 35
T because it has all these beautiful
purples Moz gold very beautiful mats
beautiful shimmers but it just really
spoke to me because I love these kind of
colors I'm such a moth girl such a gold
girl and I thought this would be a
really good palette for me and it
definitely was I still reach for this to
this day even though I've had it for
years now and I think it's absolutely
beautiful one of my favorite palettes a
lot of times when people ask me for a
good palette that has those pretty mop
shades
I'm always recommending it's a 35 tea
because I think it is fantastic so
finally the 3500 came back in stock and
I could get it I think I'm probably
around the time where the 3500 myrrh and
the 3500 Mac came out and people are
buying them and finally the original 3/5
o came back in stock and I finally got
it this is a beautiful palette it has
been very very loved by me there's
beautiful oranges the shimmer shades in
here are absolutely stunning but there's
really pretty like neutral brown matte
shades as well one of my absolute
favorite palettes as really really happy
that I was finally able to get my hands
on this because it is just a gorgeous
gorgeous palette and then most recently
to my collection is the 35 our I've only
had to tell it for what maybe a month or
so but it has been so loved I adore this
palette I do have a full video on this
that I will leave link down below but I
did not too long ago I'm obsessed with
this palette this is a very new palette
to morphe and I can tell that the shades
in here are a step up from 35 G and the
35 oh these are still
very good shades still very happy with
the quality in there but I can tell that
these are just a step or two above or
descend those pallets and I just have
been so impressed with this pallet even
though these are not necessarily
travel-friendly pallets the 35 are has
been coming with me when I go out of
town or go to events because I just
think it's so beautiful and I love the
shades in here
the shimmers are definitely more of like
soiled shadows and they are stunning
I've been raving about this palette ever
since I got it I feel like and I just
absolutely love it the 35 pallets are
usually around 20 to 99 for each one
there's always a discount codes for
morphe floating around you can get 10%
off but 2299 435i shadows I do not think
is a bad price at all so again the 35
palettes I think they are a great way to
go I have three I can definitely see
myself purchasing more those are my 35
pallets and then I have some 25 pallets
to show as well recently morphe came out
with the 25 a and 25 B eyeshadow palette
and I have like the best social media
family ever the best friends ever
because these were actually built into
me the 25 a was sent to me by my friend
Casey V she does have a youtube channel
here I'll leave her link down below the
25 B I actually just got this like what
the day before I'm filling this video is
when I got it from Jordan I was just
like shocked and amazed so this is the
first time I'm even opening it and
seeing the 25 B and it looks gorgeous oh
my goodness is so pretty the 25 a I have
been able to use a few times and it is
so so pretty the shimmer shades in here
are so gorgeous I has also done a format
look with these Browns appear because
those are just like my shades and the
looks that I love doing so because I
love the 25a so much I'm definitely
super excited to get into the 25b and
I'm just I'm so grateful to get so so
grateful and so overwhelmed whenever I
get any packages especially from friends
and social media family it just really
means so much to me so I'm so so
grateful to be able to get both of these
palettes and to be able to test them out
I do love the morphe
shadows and I really enjoy their palette
so I was excited because I did have both
of these pellets in my makeup I regret
not buying video I'll have that link
down below I said I was super bummed I
was out of town traveling at the time
that these launched and I missed them
and so my wonderful for a symptom to me
when they came back and stock which I
thought was amazing the last time I
checked these were back in stock so
hopefully they still are and that can
leave them link down below but that is
the 25 and 25 B I have two more makeup
items before we hop into the brushes
these are the more feet liquid lipsticks
I have been so impressed with these and
I really wasn't sure what to think
because they are a bit newer and I
wasn't seeing a whole lot of reviews on
them yet and so I texted Mel I picked
them up for myself when I bought the 35
are and seriously been so impressed I
just mentioned them and my top 5 best
and worst lipsticks and they were in the
best category because they have just
been my favorites so I picked up two
shades to start with both pretty
Samantha shades a pink and brown I love
these because they are so long lasting
just so a long lasting through eating
through anything like they just stay on
the list it's really amazing to me but
they're also very comfortable they do
dry down completely matte but they do
not feel dried they don't make my lips
uncomfortable they don't do the weird
cracking thing like I was very very
impressed with these I reach for these a
lot especially when I know I'm going to
be gone for a long period of time and I
want a long wearing lipstick either when
I'm reaching for because they don't stay
on all day and I do like the shades of
them and I just like how comfortable
they are so if you even tried out the
morphe look what lipsticks yet these are
$12.99 and I definitely think they are
worth it before we have over to my
brushes I have some tools here I have
two of the flawless sponges and man this
sponge the sponge is a good one
I heard Jaclyn hill raising the bottom
and they kept going out of stock and
then finally they came back in stock and
I picked one all for myself obviously I
love it sturdy and then Jordan when she
sent me the 25b palette she also had
sent me another sponge I was like.he
because I love this
just and I also have a dog who likes to
eat my makeup sponges and she always
goes actually but ones that I love the
most is so sad my Sigma 3 DHT blender
following that today chewed up off so
bad so super excited to get it back with
this because I really do love the morphe
flawless sponge if you're on the hunt
for a good makeup sponge I definitely
would suggest the flawless sponge
someone asked me the other day to name
off my favorite makeup sponges which was
like such a rude question like why would
Kate house community sent and it was so
hard to I was like oh oh the cruel
question but the amorphous flawless
sponge it definitely made it on my list
that I highly highly recommend I just
think it is really really good I
definitely even think it gives the
Beautyblender a run for its money
I barely touched my Beauty Blender like
barely like the original like Beauty
Blender I barely touch it because I
think there are so many other good
sponges a smallest fund is right up in
there alright so now we're going to move
on to my brush collection here it is
just kidding here here is my brush
collection from Harvey and I swear I'm
probably missing like a brush or two in
my giant jumble of makeup brushes but
yeah I I really enjoy morphe brushes
well I'm just going to run through these
probably as quickly as I can let you
know the names and what I've used some
for so yeah when we go ahead and hop
into each brushes so this is the m43 9
this is what I use for foundation I
think it is a fabulous foundation brush
I recommend this one all of the time one
is the Ã¬iÃ® it's more of a pointed
brush I use this a lot to dust away
baking powder or even to apply powder
all over the face i from brush I take
this traveling with me all of the time
another one I have is the m42 7 this is
a duo fiber brush a lot of times I use
this for blush like cream blushes or
like the color pop blushes I will use a
duo fiber to apply those spaghetti is my
R 2 brush I got this for a bronzing
brush and I absolutely love it I love
big brushes I just
I just they just make me so happy
wonderful bronzing brush I use it almost
every single day this one is the e for
this is what I use for blush it's a nice
angled brush and super super soft is
amazing for blush one of my favorite
blush brushes this is the g2 this is
what I use for under-eye concealer or I
will even use it for cream contour so it
has a couple of different uses this one
is my five-30 this is what I use for
contour or bronzer and I love this brush
very happy I got that one this one is
the M 501 I use this for highlighting
I've used it so much and that it's kind
of lost its shape but I like used the
crap out of this when I first got it
it's been washed so many times but this
was definitely a very loved highlighting
brush my lovely friend Casey V she also
sent me the 25a palette and in her box
that she sent me she sent me a bunch of
the gunmetal collection.i brushes so
these are some of the eye brushes that
came in there and I have been using
these so much a couple of the standouts
to me in this collection was the G 24 is
an awesome blending brush also the g18
is just a bit of a smaller blending
brush and then the G 27 which is a
really nice pointer brush so I was
really excited all of these brushes in
the gunmetal collection have been really
really nice so huge thank you to casey
for those and then a few more eye
brushes that i have the m43 3 it's just
a really nice blending brush I use this
so often like I feel like you can't have
enough of them
also the m44 one again another blending
brush but it's a little bit more
fluffier than the other one I use this a
lot to apply the first transition color
around just kind of being kind of messy
and sloppy and the other one is when I
want a more defined crease and then I
have the e 18 a lot of times I will use
this for inner corner highlight or to
highlight the brow bone and then the e36
I love this brush it goes everywhere
with me it is what I use to apply a
lower
I shadow I love that brush I use it all
the time so those are a few more of my
aggressive my beautiful foreign Jordan
who sent me the 25 B and the flawless
sponge
I like died when she sent me that this
is the copper dreams a brush that I
always had called copper set it's the
top root dreams brush set it came in
this beautiful case as well and it's
like a traveling case because you can
put this over it if you want to travel
with your brushes which i think is
amazing and I'm definitely going to use
it for that it came with all of these
brushes and I was like no you did not
because I just have such a soft spot for
brushes you guys I feel like brushes are
like the offensive lineman of a football
team because the quarterback always gets
all of the praise and all of the
recognition but the old line is the ones
like knocking other players out of the
way so the quarterback could go damp all
like they never get the recognition that
they need for protecting that
quarterback and letting him make those
throws that's why I feel like makeup
brushes are everybody's always like oh
your makeup is so beautiful and your
eyeshadows look so amazing and blended
like what do you think this at my
fingers No
so I love makeup brushes I have a sick
obsession with them obviously but I was
so excited again I just got these
yesterday it's when I opened up the box
so I haven't even busted into the MEP I
think they are so beautiful the set came
out around the time at the same time
that the 25 and 25 beaded and I was so
disappointed because not only was I
going to buy those two palettes but I
was also going to buy this brush
collection which I thought it was
beautiful I thought it came back in
stock and I had it in my bag because
morphe just released a setting spray
that I'm feeling real thirsty for
because I also love spending sprays and
makeup Smith and I was like I had my bag
ready to go I had other items added in
there so when the setting spray came I
could just go ahead and buy it and this
was definitely in my bag and then when I
got it I was like this is just amazing
so I'm so excited to use these brushes
there's a combination of face and eye
brushes and the duo fiber brush in there
which I thought was very cool but super
super excited to have this and I just
thought the case was so apparent cute as
well and I love this travel friendly so
it's all for my morphe brushes brush
collection and I will also do it for my
morphe brushes
entire collection this is guys
possessing
everything for my Marv you brushes
