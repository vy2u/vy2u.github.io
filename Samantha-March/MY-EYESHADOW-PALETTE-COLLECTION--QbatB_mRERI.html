today's video is going to be a video
that has been a so requested so heavily
in the past two weeks or so I am going
to be sharing my eyeshadow pellet
collection I've been seeing a lot of
people doing this on YouTube and I don't
know if that's why it some more and more
requests have been coming in for it's
exactly what I'm going to be doing today
so if you would like to see my entire
eyes shadow palette collection let's go
ahead and jump into it you guys might
know that I have been doing this some
antique flutters for my makeup
collection I've done like lipstick
highlighter is my most recent when I did
with foundations I do have I shadow
palette declutter coming up but it's not
gonna be for at least another month if
not a little bit longer so when I was
seeing the requests coming to share my
eyeshadow palette collection I was like
oh no big deal because you know I'll
basically be doing that when I do the
declutter but knowing that it's gonna be
so far out I was like let's just go
ahead and go through it now this might
actually help me when it does come time
to declutter my eyeshadow palette
collection and I think it'll be really
fun to go through when I first started
my channel I always said I'm not an
eyeshadow palette junkie I didn't feel
it the pull to buy a lot of eyeshadow
palettes and I feel like this this could
show that something has changed I did
recently post a video on it was an
office tour and kind of an overview of
my makeup collection and I think what
I'm gonna do for this video is I'm just
gonna grab out the sections of how I
have my eye show of how to organize so
for example I'm just gonna grab this
first one here that was on top of my
desk and go through it that way and then
that way I can just be putting
everything back because otherwise it
could get really messy and overwhelming
in my room two palettes here from Too
Faced the first one is the chocolate
bonbon palette I got this one it sent to
me from a subscriber which was so fun
because this is my first chocolate bar
palette from Too Faced if you watch my
makeup confessions tag about cult makeup
favorites that I have never tried I
mentioned the original chocolate bar
palette from Too Faced but I do have
this chocolate bonbon one and I had a
really good time was I thought the
shades were really nice and I like some
of these lighter pinks in there I liked
the Browns so I do enjoy that palette
and then the other one I have it from
Too Faced is the sweet peach palette
this palette was so hard to get to my
hands on I was that girl waiting outside
Ulta for the door to open
when this release I think was like last
spring but I got it and I really do love
this talent I continually reach for it
quite enjoy it the next one I have is
the Urban Decay's the naked smoky
palette this is what this one looks like
I'm not going to be going through life's
watching everything because this video I
think is going to be long enough anyways
and I was trying to do swatches at the
same time that could be really really
really long video but the naked smoky I
got this one as a Christmas gift last
year or two years ago I can't quite
remember but I got this one as a gift I
quite like it I like the darker shades
but when I am trying to create a smokey
eye I played with this one quite a bit
and then I have my original Carli bybel
and BH Cosmetics palette this is the
first one that came out so the smaller
one that has the eye shadows and the
highlights my mouth got this for me for
my birthday a couple years ago and I was
so excited about that next time I have
this a makeup revolution to pellit this
is the ultra eye contour light and shade
I picked this one up to see if it was a
deep before the Kat Von D shade + light
eye shadow palette it definitely is it's
a lot cheaper then they can't fund be a
shade in mind the shades aren't you know
to the Kat Von D level but still pretty
good
of course the packaging is not quite Kat
Von D either but again I got mine from
Ulta and it was quite a bit cheaper this
one is from anasazi Beverly Hills it's
the a master palette by a Mario I had a
subscriber dimitra's than this one to me
as well which I was so excited about
it's mentioned this in my first two
makeup I regret not buying video because
I always you know was seeing really good
things about it and people really
enjoyed this palette it was limited
edition you can't get it anymore and
Dmitry was like I have to I'll send you
one I was like what so cool I am hearing
that maybe a second palette is coming
does anybody else heard that I don't
know if that's been confirmed or not ah
this one is a deck of scarlet palette
deck of scarlet is a subscription
service so inside you know some of these
are kind of gonna be face palettes -
shadows in them and things like that so
we might have a little bit of overlap
here but items that are like solely
Faced palettes I'm going to leave out of
here but this one does have the eye
shadows up here it has a bronzer a
highlight and then a couple of cream I
think these are lip products which I'm
not a big fan
the creams and I have my lorac brunch
palette of this palette from Ulta in the
spring this was my first purchase from a
la rocca cosmetics it's a very pastel
spring a palette I quite liked it I know
that some pretty mixed reviews but I
thought it was pretty good and then I
have these morphe palettes these are the
25 a and 25 B my friend Jordan did send
these to me as well which have me so
excited cuz I think I also mentioned
these and I regret video I was like man
I should have picked them up they were a
limited edition I think they're back now
though I think they're permanent maybe
and I think you can also get them at
Ulta so there's that but we have the 25
a and then the 25 B have some little Z
palettes tucked into the side here this
first one is a from makeup geek it has a
bunch of the makeup geek a single
shadows some of my favorite eyeshadows
and some of like my LG eyeshadows and
then I have another little Z palette
with some I'm Stasi Beverly Hills
singles in here I don't know I've talked
about these in the past I don't even
know what videos they would be in but
her single shadows don't quite impress
me as much as her shadows that are in
the regular eyeshadow palettes
especially pink champagne
just did not do much for me I think it's
pink champagne they're just they're just
okay to me I definitely prefer her
eyeshadow palette and then I do have
these two pure vanity palettes here
these are kind of all-in-one face
palettes as well this one is called
Dream Chaser so you have your eyeshadows
over here this is a bronzer but I
typically use that as a crease shade and
then it has a blush and highlight too
and also a mirror and then this other
one is called gold digger and I really
enjoyed this palette actually for the
face items bronzer blush in the
highlights but it does have these
eyeshadows over here as well this one is
from Tarte my friend Lisa sent this one
to me it's the make believe in your self
palette so it's very very shimmery I
like jewel toned eyeshadow palette and
it does have a highlight shade in the
middle and that everything in this first
row right here except for this palette
right here it's not technically an
eyeshadow palette it's an all face
palette so that's that one from Tarte
but otherwise everything else in here is
an eyeshadow palette so that one that I
have sitting on top of my desk looks
like this and then some of these pellets
in here this is the latest collaboration
between Carli bybel and BH Cosmetics
it's the deluxe edition palette so just
more eyeshadows and more highlights in
here I really enjoy that palette I
recommend that one quite a bit - this is
from lorac cosmetics it is the Pirates
of the Caribbean I shadow palette so
here is what that one looks like I
didn't receive that one from the rock
and I was so excited to get actually the
full Pirates of the Caribbean collection
that was super exciting to me and then
next we have this one from violet boss
this is the holy girl I shadow palette
to my friend Michelle sent this one to
me and I'm obsessed with it I recommend
this all the time I reach for this all
the time definitely one of my favorite
pellets I'm very excited to see by the
boss in Sephora I think that's so cool
and it's from a soap &amp;amp; Glory it is the
perfect ten eyes shadow palette and then
here is what the inside looks like it's
kind of a nice neutral palette but a
little bit darker here at the end - soap
&amp;amp; Glory I think they're still Ulta and
you can also find them at drugstores
also and then I have two palettes here
from pur cosmetics the trolls palette
and also be my little pony palette the
trolls palette is one of my favorite
palettes I think it's so good if you can
find it anywhere I think it came back on
the pure website I'm not sure if it's
still there
but I know some people are saying they
found it at Kohl's too but I love that
palette and they recently came out with
the My Little Pony palette which I don't
think is as good as the trolls palette
at all I know some people do like this
one but for me I didn't like this one
does much but the trolls palette I would
definitely recommend it that one and
then I have two little eyeshadow
palettes on the side here this first one
is from Maybelline it's one of the new
city mini palettes and this one is in
rooftop bronze it's an all shimmer
palette it's nice it's super small it's
easy to like store and travel with all
shimmers so I really only reach into
this you know not so often cuz I am NOT
a huge fan of the all shimmer palettes
but it's nice especially for the
drugstore and then I have this one from
Smashbox it's one of the cover shot
pellets it's in metallic the packaging
is pretty fun on this one and this is
what the inside of it looks like so
again
I like the metallic shimmer shades in
here so I kind of have those two tucked
over here on the side because I don't
reach for him as much but if I do need a
shade like that I can reach into that
pallet day so we're going to keep it
rolling so I have everything off the top
of my desk and now I'm gonna go into
like these sides of my desk where I've
actually lapels again if you saw the
room tour at this this would make a lot
of sense to you so next up I have my
morphe 35o palette yeah I got I got a
lot more if you fellas so let's let's
just dig into this pile shall we so
first up we have the 35s this one was
sent to me by morphe unnies i have
purchased myself as some I recently did
get a pretty large payer package from
morphe at the 35f was in there I've used
it such a pretty palette I wanted to buy
this myself for the longest time but it
kept being sold out and I was getting so
frustrated next up we have the 35 our I
did purchase this one myself when it
came out and I was obsessed with it I
love this palette it kept coming
traveling with me I know I went on for a
bachelorette party
this was the palette that I chose to
bring with me it is so so good the
formula is very similar to like the
Jaclyn hill and the new 3502 palette
just a little bit a little bit lesser
but still really really good this next
one is the 35 T this is the first ever
morphe 35o eyeshadow palette that I
purchased and I loved it I don't know if
you can tell on camera but it is so
dirty it has been so loved I love all of
these shades these are just like my
tones I so highly enjoyed that palette
next up we have the 35p this one was
sent to me from morphe recently I
haven't had a chance to play with this
one yet but I can't wait to because I
love purple a purple on my eyes today
I think purple and green eyes go so well
together so I'm so excited so excited to
have that palette next up I have the
original three 500 I did for just this
one myself and I loved this palette it
took me so long to get it because this
one was always sold out but I finally
got it I'm super happy when I did next
up we have the 35 K palette this is
another one that morphe did send to me
but I have this one on my wish list for
such a long time I don't know what it
was about like these cool toned blues
over here that were just really cool
to me so I was really excited to see
that one in the package that they sent
over to me and then the other one that I
have here is the recent jaclyn hill
pallets that morphe came out with I mean
hands-down one of my favorite eyeshadow
palettes like ever I reach for this one

that is my pile of 35 palettes from
morphe so next to those palettes I just
have a stack here so I have the Kat Von

is an eyeshadow palette and it does have
some face shades here I love this
palette another one that I'm always

another favorite is the Anasazi Beverly
Hills a modern renaissance palette of
course I love this palette it is so used

also have the Smashbox this is the shape
matters photo bat eyes palette I think
is the name of it I was like so obsessed
with this palette when I first got it
this is a very old eyeshadow palette to
me as well it's an all matte palette but
it has some really fun shades in here
like pinks and blues and this palette
has gotten a lot of love from me and
then also in that stack is the Anasazi
Beverly Hills subculture palette I have
a pretty recent review on this palette

and then in here I also have the morphe

I did get this one it sent to me from
actally and I've been testing it out and
so far I've really been enjoying this
palette I almost had my review ready
because I've almost tried the majority
of the shades here but I've done really
neutral I've done more smoky I've done
some with these deeper shimmers and so
far so good for this palette I really
have been enjoying it I think the
packaging is so pretty so I also have a
palette here from Weiser this is my
first dies art or busy art palette it is

collection so this is what the palette
looks like ad this was sent to me in PR
as well from Urban Decay I have it on my
eyes today I've been testing it out like
crazy because I want to do a full review
on it of course but then after these two
holiday palettes I think that is going
to be everything for my eyeshadow
palette collection whoo all right so

gonna be a longer video so I was trying
to get through those as quickly as I

declare when that time comes around but
I hope that you guys enjoy seeing it
