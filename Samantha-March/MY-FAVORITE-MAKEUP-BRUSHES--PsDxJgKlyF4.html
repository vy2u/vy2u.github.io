so excited for today's video because
it's finally going to be my updated
favorite makeup brushes video I did this
about last year maybe a little over a
year ago and I've been seeing it
requested to do an updated video a lot
lately so that's what I'm going to be
doing running through all of my favorite
makeup brushes the ones that I reach for
on a daily basis or very consistent
basis and I'm super excited to show you
these brushes because I love makeup
brushes i hoard makeup brushes I find
makeup brushes like I have an obsession
with makeup brushes so I'm so excited to
show you my favorite ones I think I have
about 30 brushes here so it's probably
going to be a longer video but I really
want to show you all the brushes that I
love what I use them for everything will
be linked down below just let you know
there's a lot of Sigma in here and a lot
of Marci in here those are my two
favorite companies for makeup brushes so
you will be seeing a lot of those in
this video so just wanted to give you a
heads up on there other than that if
you'd like to see if my favorites and
makeup brushes currently why don't I go
ahead and get started start off with the
face and we're going to start off with
my foundation brushes I have four
different brushes here that I absolutely
love to kick it off with we have the
Sigma flat kabuki this is the SAT this
is just one of those classic brushes
that I feel like so many people talked
about so many people rave about so many
people own somebody put it in favourites
videos and it's for a very good reason
it just as a freaking solid foundation
brush it just really is I actually just
got this brush it is my newest one I had
planned on filming this video last
weekend and I washed all the brushes
that I was going to talk about and then
I ended up not filming and then I've
used the brushes again so quite a few of
them are going to be dirty because
they're my favorite brushes and I use
them but I just got this one that
haven't even touched it yet so it's nice
and new and clean but be regular SAT
kabuki it is $25 I know that it can seem
expensive for Sigma brushes but all of
them do have at least a two-year
warranty on the other thing is to go
wrong with your brush in the two years
you just contact Sigma and then you do
have the warranty which i think is
awesome and Sigma to me you are going to
see a lot of Sigma in this video I
started buying from Sigma Beauty and I
started buying their brushes before I
even had my channel and I continually
purchase for them because they are some
of the highest quality brushes that I
own that they are more on the pricier
side compared to some other brands they
are worth
the quality and they are still not the
price of some of the real higher end
brands and I think their quality matches
those they are amazing quality I have
yet to throw out a sigma brush I have
yet to throw in a sigma brush which is
crazy I've had to throw out other brands
brushes before even after just a few
uses you wash them and they fall apart
and it's not good it's not the way with
Sigma brushes so that is super
impressive but the SAT is just an
absolute classic also for Sigma beauty I
am affiliate with them so I do have an
affiliate code it's just Amanda it gets
you 10% off your purchase so if you're
ever going to purchase from Sigma Beauty
and you want to save some money if you
do use my code I thank you so much
because it is still a code which means I
get a small portion of the sales which
then it goes back to my channel
so I thank you very much if you do use
that I will have that down below as well
as well with all of these links in case
you're interested in any of the brushes
but the first one for foundations that I
want to recommend is the SAT the next
one that I have also from Sigma this is
one of their newer brushes and I am
obsessed with it this is the 3d HD max
kabuki Ida star as part of the new
dimensional brush line that Sigma has
come out with and they are super super
unique brushes if you can see how the
brushes is this has become I like look
how dirty this is I just watch this but
look how Purdy this is I used it today a
gal but I love this brush so much I love
all of the different contours it has
because you can really get to any part
of your face I just love the way it is
applying foundation so the new brush to
Sigma it is $27 for the 3d HD max kabuki
but I highly recommend it I am actually
placing an order with Sigma soon and I'm
seriously considering already buying a
backup so I don't have to keep watching
this one like every other day because
I'm using it so much so the 3d HD max
kabuki is a new favorite and I highly
recommend so before the 3d HD max kabuki
came out the one that I was loving from
Sigma and I still do love is through
just regular old 3d HD kabuki brush so
it's really similar to the last brush
that I showed you it's just a little bit
smaller in scale and has more of a
defined style so you just have the two
slopes here and then the kind of sharp
contour right here I like these brushes
I mean they're good for foundations or
even
the for blending out like if you do
cream contour you can even take this
side and come down your nose if you
cream contour there they're just really
nice multifunctional brushes and like I
said this one was one I was reaching for
so much before the new bear guy came out
and now I'm kind of finding myself
reaching for that one a little bit more
but I still do really like the 3d HD
kabuki and before I got this brush I
mean I've been planning this video for
awhile before I got that brush which was
very recently this one was on my list so
I still did want to mention it so the 3d
HD kabuki is going to be $25 and I think
it is a fantastic foundation brush and
finally a foundation brush that I really
love from morphe is the m-43 9 this is a
fantastic foundation brush it's a big
Daddy which I do love my big fat makeup
brushes I just can't help it had no
complaints with my M 439 and I have
recommended it several several times I
believe it was probably mentioned in my
last favorite brushes video I like this
one I haven't had any problems with like
the shedding or the bristles falling
apart even though I've owned this for a
very long time I think this is one of my
first morphe brushes purchases brush
wise from them
I haven't had any problems with it when
I was cleaning it it goes back to the
shape right away it's a really dense
brush too so I think it's really good
for foundation only $13.99 which i don't
think is a bad price for a foundation
brush the morphe and 4 3 9 if you're
looking for a little bit more affordable
option for a foundation brush I would
say check this one out we got into a
couple brushes that I absolutely love
for concealer I have two different
brushes here one is actually from
Sephora and I mentioned this recently in
my 10 products I think you need in your
support cart I mentioned this a lot of
you guys said that you already had it
and you loved it or that you were
planning on picking it up which made me
really excited because I love this brush
and I have on this brush for at least 3
years if not more it was one of my first
purchases that I made for myself I
started my youtube channel already and
everybody would always talk about how
you need a good brush to blend your
concealer in it so I went to Sephora and
I picked up a brush that said airbrush
concealer I was like that sounds like
what people are telling me that I need
and I bought it and I have no regrets it
was $24 which is pricey and especially
when I was such a newbie and had no idea
what I was doing to spend $24 on my
brush like that was a big deal to me and
so for it to be just a phenomenal brush
excites me so much
this is what it looks like and I'm not
kidding you guys when I tell you I use
this brush almost every single day I use
it to blend out my concealer under my
eyes anywhere on my face I use it to put
eyelid primer on I use it to put
concealer on my eyes I just used this
brush every single day that I'm using
makeup and it's one of my absolute
favorites $24 I know does sound
expensive but seriously I have this
brush like I said for at least three
years if not more and I have had no
issues with it I have washed it over and
over again and it nothing nothing's
wrong with the bristles nothing is wrong
with the brush the Sephora 57 brush if
you are looking for a good concealer
brush a fantastic concealer brush I
suggest this one time habits from Sigma
this is the s 79 concealer blend kabuki
I really love this brush because of the
shape so you can see that it's a bit
bigger typically what I do if I have
days like today we're undoing a pretty
natural eye look I will do my face first
instead of my eyes I'll do my primary
Moss foundation and then I'll put
concealer on and I will use my concealer
as my eyelid primer for days and I'm
using just an eyelid primer or I'm just
putting a little bit of concealer
underneath my eyes I go to a smaller
brush for the days that I'm really going
heavy on the concealer and also bringing
it up on to my eyelids I use this
because it's a little bit bigger in size
so it's not too big to where it's like
getting concealer everywhere because
that happens it still is very precise on
the under eyes but it's very quick
blending time so if I have a lot of
concealer going on around my eyes this
is the brush that I'm reaching for and I
absolutely adore it because it's big
enough but it's also small enough to get
the job done so this is $23 from the
Sigma website and again this is the s 79
what I love for concealer I'm going to
use a setting powder to set the
concealer I'm typically always reaching
for this brush this is from Real
Techniques and it is C deluxe concealer
brush so you can see that it's just
pretty small but it's nice and rounded
there I mean I use this to set concealer
on my under eyes I'll use it to set my
eyelid primer with like a translucent
powder I just reached for this one a ton
I did pick this up in a set actually but
I believe you can get it on its own for
$6.99 I'll link it down to Ulta below is
where I found it when I use this one
almost every day as well so this video
might get interesting because we just
lost
power and my internet is not back up so
I don't have any of the presence right
now so that's really fun but moving on
to contour I have one here from elf
cosmetics and this is part of their like
beautifully precise line I think is what
it's called
it is the 104 brush this is what it
looks like and you can tell it's just
really really dense and really flat and
just really can get into that cheekbone
to carve out a contour and I love it
definitely love it I love the really
cool clear design on it I thought that
was really fun for elf cosmetics and
it's such a good brush for powder
contour we'll have the price right here
and I also have the prices down in the
description box below with the links as
well sorry I'm an internet went out is a
really bad storm diaper fund from ELF is
so good the other one that I have that I
use for powder contour quite a bit is
from Sigma Beauty this is the so6 powder
sweep so this is what it looks like and
you can see the bristles here are just
nice small but it is also very dense at
the same time yet not like super dense
like this one actually has a couple
different uses I use it mostly for my
powder contour but in a pinch I've
actually even used it as a highlight
brush I think it works really well for
growth but like I said I do use this
mostly for my powder contour and I just
like how small it is to really get in
there for more precise contour if you're
into that but if you are I would suggest
the fo6 from sigma i reach for this one
that's so often so i'm going to talk
about a face brush this is from morphe
this is the e3 and i use this one for a
variety of different uses as well i will
use this one as a face powder if I want
to set my foundation with the powder if
I just want to wear like a powder
foundation and don't do it a ton but
when I do it
I typically am using the e3 I have
useless to put a setting powder on my
under eyes and I also use this to kind
of blend everything together on my face
I notice if I have any sort of harsh
lines from contour or bronzer or blush
or highlight or whatever it is I need to
make sure everything is nice and blended
on my face I typically am reaching for
this brush it's more of a so what's more
affordable it is from their elite line
which is when it says III that's from
their elite line which is a little bit
more expensive I get so many different
uses out of this one and I reach for it
almost every single day as well so the
Ã¬iÃ® from morphe is a good one and then
next I'm going to talk about some
favorite bronzer brushes this one is
from morphe also this is the are two
such a big daddy of a brush and I just
love it
I believe this one was recommended to me
from a Jaclyn hill she mentioned that
she loved this one for bronzer and
seriously like it's a bomb bronzer brush
at first I got it I was like autumn no
man because I mean you put it on your
face it's like we're all are you going
to be putting the bronzer but somehow it
still works because it kind of tapers
here a little bit so it's not like a
huge like powder brush it still tapers
enough that you are still only placing
the bronzer where you want to place it
on your face but if you just need a
quick sec to put your bronzer on you go
ahead and grab the art too because it's
going to be super super fast this is
part of the rose gold collection again
that's what the R stands for and you can
see the handle here has the rose gold
type to us I want to say this was like
in the fifteen to seventeen dollar range
but I reached for this one so much and I
travel with this one quite a bit first I
love to use for bronzer is from Sigma
Beauty this is the large powder s thirty
brush this one is more about the travel
friendly brush would be kind of like a
turquoise handle here now it says it's a
powder brush but I picked it up one day
because I needed a bronzer brush and all
my other ones were dirty I grabbed this
when I was like I can make it work and
it does it works really good for a
bronzer brush I don't know if you'd be
able to see but it does still kind of
have that kind of taper feeling right
here just like the r2 does so it's not
too big like a traditional powder brush
where it could kind of just get stuff
everywhere and if you watch my tutorials
and Instagram you do see this brush
quite a bit for my bronzing needs I want
to say I used it today when I was using
my bronzer and so I just really like it
I like how it's kind of smaller in
trouble from me as well so this one is
the Sigma f30 that I use for bronzer one
I want to talk about I have two
different blush brushes here this one is
from Sigma Beauty as well this is the
large angled contour the f40 brush this
is what the Sun looks like I really love
these kind of angled brushes or my blush
brushes my other one is an angled brush
as well what it is but I just reach for
this one that it's so consistent like so
they Sigma f40 does run for $23 right
now they do have it as a free gift
option on the signal website so if you
were to purchase from it you could add
in this travel size guide as a free gift
but if you buy
regular chrome regular size of it it
would be $23 the other flush brush that
I used very frequently is the morphe for
house this one for a long time and I've
been recommending it for a while it is
very very similar in shape to the Sigma
one like I said I just kind of prefer
these angled brushes for my blush I'm
not sure what it is that attracts me to
it but clearly something does so this
one on the morphe website is $13.99 i
got this as a recommendation from jaclyn
hill again
she decided what's her favorite blush
brush and I agree it's one of my
absolute favorites as well and I use it
so often we morphe four fantastic blush
brush and for a little bit cheaper than
the Sigma one if you're looking for a
more affordable option so next I want to
talk about some highlighting brushes I
have two brushes here and one of them I
actually own double double this is from
Alexi Beauty this is the 522 tapered
highlight I used it today and I just
really really enjoyed this highlighting
brush this is one that I can use for
highlights that are just super super
pigmented like you have those highlights
that are almost kind of like whoa you're
incredibly blinding you don't need any
sort of like scratchy brush to help pick
it up you don't need a really dense
brush to help pick it up you can do a
more fluffier brush like the lux e 5:22
and it's still going to be incredibly
pigmented incredibly highlighted and you
can kind of go a little bit channel
asleep it of a fluffier brush and that
is when I pull out my 5:22 it's one of
my favorites it's super super soft I
love the shape of it just again this
more kind of like tapered tulip tip but
it does come to a nice tip right here to
really get the highlight on or you can
lay it kind of more sideways on your
face and just really go to town whatever
it is you want to do it is a little bit
expensive about $24 but I think it's
really cute with the pink and the rose
gold and again I just I reach for this
one so often actually Sigma has a more
affordable option for the highlight
brush that I love this is the high
cheekbones highlighter the so3 I have
mentioned this in favourites videos I
love this highlight brush I'd so3 from
Sigma one of my absolute favorite so
this one all of the time but this is for
one where if you have a highlight where
maybe you do need to give it a little
bit of help you really want to pack that
highlight onto your brush to get it onto
your cheekbones this is the one that
that's going to be really good for it
takes up so much highlight it takes up
so much product but then it plays
is it on your face so well it doesn't
keep any highlight hanging around in the
brush it just applies it so nice and all
I said it but it was twenty dollars
compared to $24 for the Lexi highlight
brush well those are my personally my
two favorite highlight brushes on the
ones I'm reaching for the most and I
just love this so3 we have a special
bond and move over into the eye brushes
and first going to talk about my
favorite blending brushes so one that I
own as doubles up is the Sigma e-40 and
I actually I'm pretty sure on another
one to a regular crow
I might have just washed it though so
this is the Sigma e-40 I feel like you
hear a ton of people talk about this one
this is one of the very first as
blending brushes that I ever purchased
because I've heard so many people rave
about it and I absolutely love it this
is a big ol fluffy crease brush this is
what I come in with when I'm doing like
my first transition color my first
crease color I'm using my Sigma f40
because I think it's absolutely amazing
these are $17 on the Sigma website if
you're looking for a more affordable
option one that I think is a pretty good
soup is the morphe m4 for one so this is
what this one looks like and I don't
know if you can tell in the camera
though like this is kind of a comparison
between the Sigma and morphe you can see
if this one from morphe is just the
bristles are just kind of going
everywhere where my Sigma ones even
though I've had people for a while and
I've washed them several times
none of the bristles are out of place
for the morphe one is just kind of going
everywhere so that's why I recommend
Sigma even at a higher price because the
quality is there but if you're a
beginner you're a newbie you want to
check out different brushes and see what
you're most comfortable with you can get
something that's a little bit more
inexpensive and work your way up to
those more quality pieces because this
one is only $5.99 from morphe but the
bristles are chemical one everywhere
this is a pretty close comparable to the
Sigma e-40 especially if the morphe one
was a little bit newer and a little bit
less washed I think it'd be super super
comparable and then the other one from
morphe that I think is pretty comparable
to the Sigma e-40 is from their gunmetal
line and this is the G 24 so you can see
once again it's just a fluffy crease
brush and I really do like it I reach
for this one quite a bit as well and as
only a dollar more than the one
from the end category which is kind of
like the regular category for morphe so
this is 699 so honestly if I were to
recommend between the m4 for one and
then but do 24 I would recommend the G
24 over it these are some of my favorite
fluffy blending brushes
moving on to some more crease brushes
that I love these ones are a little bit
more on the precise dense side I would
say how many times I'm going to say
dents in a video for real I have three
of these because I love them this is
from Sigma this is the e25 so you can
see that obviously all three of these
are dirty I mean these are brushes that
I just use every single day and it's why
it really helps to have multiples and
triples of some of these brushes because
I am constantly cleaning them to try to
keep them as clean as I can so it just
helps once you start getting two and
three and even four of brushes it helps
so much but the Sigma e25 is hands-down
one of my absolute favorite brushes and
Arenal if you can't tell from this but
it just is it's $16 again I have some
from the copper line and then one of the
regular brushes too but the e25 is such
an amazing brush for any sort of crease
work that you are doing one that I think
is pretty comparable from morphe is the
M 4-3-3 so again I do think this is
pretty comparable to the e25 we'll go
ahead and fold up the e25 so you can see
there but once again you can see from
morphe that it has kind of started to
lose its shape the bristles are starting
to kind of go everywhere but once again
this is only $5.99 in comparison to the
$60 I think you're just getting a better
quality with the sigma over the morphe
but if you want a more affordable option
the M 4-3-3 so if you're looking for
some more crease work those are my
favorite brushes so a brush said that I
want to talk about from morphe because
they have some of my three favorite
blending brushes in there this is called
the copper dreams brush side it's 39.99
on the morphe website these brushes in
that collection are just absolute
standouts to me I mentioned this
recently in a favorites video maybe a
month or two back in the brush that
you're actually getting twelve different
brushes most of them are eye brushes
with the auricle face brushes as well
and then you also get like a rose gold
brush holder if you watched my makeup
that I travel with I mentioned my
brushes too and I actually bring along
that case with me when I travel so you
get all that for $40 which I don't think
is a bad price but these three brushes
are absolute standout
to me and I use them almost daily you
can't buy them individually which sucks
like they don't have an individual name
or anything on them you can just get
them in that set but they are all so
good so if you're interested in picking
up a brush set for only $40 in getting
three fantastic brushes here I think
they are all amazing for the crease for
blending I just I really really enjoy
these brushes he said I have more
brushes that I love for the creased
areas just out of fear that I have two
of these this is the Sigma e45 the small
tapered blending I actually use this
today to apply a darker color really
kind of precisely in my crease and then
on the outer V as well I also used it to
kind of like smudge this liner oh look
out I just love this brush when I first
got it I was like I don't know it's kind
of like firm and a little bit stiff like
I don't know if I will love it but if
you do Chris Burke or like cut creases
anything like that
I think the e45 is really going to come
in handy it's sixteen dollars from sigma
beauty and for my thing if I have a
couple of brushes that I like to pack i
shadow onto the lid these are both from
sigma one is the e 54 and then one is
the e55 are really similar to one
another at the e 54 it's just or the e55
which is right here it's just a little
bit smaller and a little bit more of
like a domed shape so this is what if
I'm like if I am doing a cut crease
which I don't do very often or if I'm
doing something where I really want to
make sure the shadow is not going above
my crease like if I'm using glitter or
anything like that this is typically
what I use to just Pat it onto my eyelid
if I'm a little bit more relaxed today
ziyal I will go for the e 54 I believe
these are both 16 dollars but they are
what I use as my flat shader brush is
very frequently another first I really
like to pack shadows onto the lid this
is from morphe it's from the gunmetal
line and this is the g20 so you can see
how kind of how small it is and this is
a synthetic brush which is really good
for like foiled shadows even glitter or
things like that I will tend to use more
synthetic brushes for that is exactly
what the g20 is I really do need another
one of this guy because I feel like I am
cleaning it constantly it's only $4.99
though so total is the next time I place
an order from morphe I should just pick
up another one of the g20 this is a
brush
it might not seem super exciting but
something that I use on almost a daily
basis so I want to mention it
so in Sigma Beauty it's the e60 to cut
crease so this is what this one looks
like so you can definitely use it for
the function that it says to cut the
crease with like a concealer but what I
use it a lot for too is to place an
eyeshadow primer onto my lid so that
might not seem like super sexy or a cool
way to use a brush but it's something I
do almost every single day and something
that probably a lot of you do as well
you use an eyelid primer and this is the
brush that I typically reach for the e62
it's $17 so to put pricey for the brush
if you're only gonna use it for those
reasons but if you're someone who loves
to do a cut crease this is a really
really good brush for it I we're nearing
the end I only have three more brushes
left and these are kind of my more
precise brushes so this one is from
morphe this is the g18 so that that one
looks like this is called the round
crease and it is $5.99 to me it's kind
of similar to a pencil brush but a
little bit bigger I like to use this one
like what I use it for the other day was
when I was using that massage via silk
culture I use it to just kind of pass
the motion in the outer V if I'm using
any kind of like darker color so that I
really want to use just darken up my
outer V I use this because it is super
super precise but it's still big enough
that it can get the job done without me
having to take forever to sit there and
do it
I can also blend out lower last shadows
with it I can use it to smudge like a
shadow as a liner on the top of my eyes
it has a lot of different functions so
the g18 I use this one quite a bit next
step the final two brushes are both from
morphe and I've talked about these and
recommended these so much one is the e
18 if you watch my Instagram tutorials
you see me use this constantly this is
what I use for a brow bone highlight and
also an inner corner highlight I love
this brush I can't live without it I
can't travel without it this is what I
use for that function I don't know if I
ever use any other brushes for a brow
bone and inner corner highlight it's
always the e18 and it's only $5.99 and
the final brush I want to recommend from
morphe is the e36 so this one is just a
teeny tiny little baby brush this is
$4.99 it's called the detail crease
brush this is my favorite brush for
lower lash shadows my favorite I use
this one all the time for that reason
and I just love
the brush it's like another one that I
feel like I can't live without because I
use it for my lower lashline so much
there's obviously a ton of different
brushes that you can use for these more
kind of precise features but these are
just my favourites the ones that I
travel with the ones that I always have
to use the morphe 36 is the final brush
that I want to recommend to you in my
