so today's video is going to be my
favorite self tanners this video has
been requested since the fourth summer
even started so I'm so sorry I has been
so late on this video but a lot of
sloping trace about what I use to self
tanners I'm going to walk you through my
three favorite self tanners today I am
also giving myself a challenge today so
we will see how this goes I am
challenging myself to the one take
challenge I think is what I'll call it I
have no idea this is out there this is
even a thing but this is totally
inspired by my friend Olivia from live
loves her makeup she does all of her
videos in one take which I'm like how
how do you do that but I've been so
inspired by her and we have such a fun
friendship and I was like you know what
I'm gonna take on your challenge and
even though she doesn't challenge
herself in her video such as how she
does it that's just how she is
I'm like you know what this is a
challenge for me because it takes me a
very long time to record my video it's
also going to be a challenge because my
sony a 5100 overheats at 13 minutes so I
don't know if we can fit this all in in
13 minutes to get a true one take but
I'm going to try I mean there's going to
be no editing I'm not going to be
cutting myself out at all the only thing
that I'll be doing is putting in my
intro and outro screen so like I do in
most of my videos but that's it for my
editing I'm not clipping myself and not
doing any of that so we will see how
this goes
I'll have live channel a link to
develope our out I definitely say you do
because she's awesome but I'm going to
be talking about my favorite self
tanners today before we get started I
want to say thank you so much for
clicking on this video I do upload every
single day so if you enjoy daily content
on makeup and beauty make sure to hit
the subscribe button but to jump right
into it I'm used to cutting myself right
there you see what I did there but we're
going to jump right into it the first
one that I want to talk about is from
million dollar pan we will have all of
these listed down below million dollar
can you can also get at Ulta what are
you from them is there there's mermaid
mousse extreme so this is what the
packaging looks like this is actually my
second bottle of this stuff and this is
their dark sunless tanning mousse they
do have the mermaid mousse and then they
have the mermaid moves extreme I have
tried a couple different products from
the Million Dollar tans with the
merveilleuse extreme
it's just my absolute favorite I do also
have a mitt from them this is what their
met looks like it's just the standard
black mitt I don't think this is my
favorite tanning image that I have ever
used but it is still but it still is a
pretty good one and I think I always
pair it with this guy as well so this is
a $32 again I will have it a link down
below it's for four ounces it's more of
the Moosey texture when you spray it out
and it's one that you get very instant
results from and it is pretty extreme I
haven't tried there mermaid mousse like
the regular one I've always gone to the
extreme because like if I'm going to
self tan like I want to self tan you
know what I'm saying like I don't want
to just feel like oh I look a little bit
tanner I like to really do the extreme
and it says extreme but it's not
anything too overwhelming it's not
warned at all I don't find this to be
streaky I have tried self tanners that
have oh my gosh that's so streaky and I
don't find it with this one you do have
to leave it on for quite sometime I
think it's either like that you have six
to eight hours you do have to leave it
on before you can shower so that's the
only part that I don't love so much
because I feel like I'm just like kind
of marinating you know I'm sitting
around marinating and then you start to
get like the self-tan smell but after
six to eight hours I do wash it off and
then you know it's an instant darker tan
which I really do like so this has been
one of my favorites like I said I've
gone through one bottle already and then
this is my second bottle of the American
extreme and then moving out and see what
I did that I'm used to cutting myself
off so the strange the other hard part
about doing this is that I don't have a
table in front of me my desk is over
here so I have to put everything on my
desk so it's kind of hard because I have
to like reach out of frame so when I do
live and I do like like I could do a lot
of PR hauls live on my consoles art like
I'm having to reach out of frame it's
super annoying
but another one of my absolute favorite
self primers is from versus PHA I
believe that you can only get vs. spot
on their websites I'll have that link
down below I thought it was super
interesting because I actually used to
do a lot of self-tanning like going to a
tanning salon and using their
self-tanner like their booth where you
stand in and it sprays you and it was
always called the vs. boss so now they
have items that you can actually buy to
tan at home I always use the
intensifying primer before I
do sell can and just helps to intensify
and accelerate your can and then the
items that I use are the gradual tanning
spa butter and I think I only have like
one guy left of us like one use left
which makes me really sad because I love
it and I also have their gradual tanning
a face moisturizer this I'm pretty sure
has made it into my favorites videos
because I love both of these now like
the name says these are gradual tanners
it's not going to be like the million
dollar can--it where you use it and you
immediately see results you have to use
them I would say at least for a week
like every single day and then you will
see the tan and then you can kind of
space it out like every other day every
two days depending on what type of tan
that you want but it does take a few
days to intensify your tan and to show
the color but if you are someone who
likes a more gradual tan or a lighter
can this could be a good option for you
and again I just really really love
these guys I can pull up the website
here and tell you the gradual space
moisturizer is 35 and then at the
attaining butter is $40 and you get six
fluid ounces in there so I will have
that site listed down below and then
this is the mitt that I got from their
site as well it's a lot different from
like the million dollar can or really
any other Tanner mitt that I've used
because it's very soft whereas the other
ones are more almost like a rubbery
feeling this one is very very soft um
but again I've been using this price Inc
this is what I've been using the longest
I would say for self tanners and I love
them if you want just a face option this
is like really good for your face I use
this one a lot as well just like my
regular moisturizer if I need a bit of a
boost so I do love the vs. spot and then
the last one that I want to talk about
it actually isn't newest one to me but
man do I love this guy
this is from Vita Liberata oh man well I
do feel like I have to talk fast I know
everybody says level is talk fast like I
get it man you're like against the clock
good talk fast so this is from Vito
Liberata you can get this I believe at
Ulta and for sure I know that you can
get it at Sephora and W deliver auto
website so I'll have all that link down
below this is their ten minutes and I
was super impressed with this because
like I said with the million dollar can
it not
- wait this is 10 minutes I mean you
just put it on and then you wait 10
minutes which by the time you finish
putting it on you even have a lesson ten
minutes and then you rinse it off and
boom you have a tan like this is perfect
for people who don't have a lot of
patience like me so this is our time in
tan and I've used it me and maybe like
three I'm gonna say three different
times I've used it so I've used it a
decent amount of times to be able to
understand how it works and I think it
is really really good I don't think the
tan is as Extreme as the million dollar
can I think I get darker with that
tanner
but it's still a really nice beautiful
tan that you will get and again only ten
minutes if you're like going out the
door you need something real quick the
ten minutes Han is a really great option
but what I just love from Vita Liberata
I think have I put this in a favorites
video I might have put this in a
favorites video this is their body blur
this is like a holy grail to me this is
what the body blur looks like and it is
freaking amazing
I believe the self tanner is $39 and I
believe this guide is $45 I'll have the
links down below
I use mine in medium it says it's an
instant HD skin finish 24-hour wear what
this guy does is literally blurs out
your body I love this I don't know where
this has been all my life
so I deal with cellulite on the back of
my legs I have no issues saying that
because it's just what it is but I'm
always very self-conscious about it I
don't love being in swimsuits because
I'm very self-conscious about the back
of my legs this seriously blurs it out
and covers the cellulite covers any
imperfections I'm also someone who
bruises very easily and I have a
60-pound lap dog who scratches me a lot
and I get bruises very easily from her
nails this covers the bruises it covers
the cellulite it blurs out your body I
use it on my legs be most I very rarely
feel like I need to use it on my arms
but I know I've read that some people
like to put it on their stomachs but
this is what I use on my legs if I'm
going out boating or just out in a
swimsuit or even in shorts or a dress I
am putting this on because it just gives
me so much more confidence it really
just does fantastic things to my
and also I use the shade medium so it
gives me a bit of a tan to has a little
bit of glimmer in it I can't tell you
how much I love this guy I will most
definitely be purchasing more I've just
been so so happy
I know forty five dollars is kind of a
lot but for that extra boost of
confidence that it gives me it is so so
worth it to me so the Vita Liberata
savita Liberata body blur instant HD
skin finish is just one of my absolute
favorites it's not so I mean it is a
self tanner because especially because
like I said I do the medium it does help
give more of a tan but I had to include
it in here because I did when I talk
about the 10-minute tan but I felt like
I had to include it in here too because
it can give you a boost of color but
really I just feel like I I just feel
like I have too much like as often as I
can if anybody deals with cellulite like
I do like give the body blur try this is
what their mitt looks like I I regularly
upstairs where I do most of my self
tanning so this is what their it looks
like and I like it I think this is
probably my favorite tanning myth that
I've tried that's more of like the
regular tuning mint versus like what the
vs. pot has but yeah did I do
are those all my favorites so Tanner's I
thought if I was going to do a one-take
challenge of like I might as well only
have to talk about three different
products because if I'm going to feel
like a long winded conversation it's
just not going to work but those are my
favorite self tanners those are what I
have continually used what I would fully
be able to recommend and what I just
want to reach for when I do want a bit
of a tan so I hope that you guys found
