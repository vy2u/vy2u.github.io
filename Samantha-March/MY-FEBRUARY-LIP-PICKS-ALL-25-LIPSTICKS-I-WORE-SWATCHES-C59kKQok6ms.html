video is going to be a little bit
different but all focused on lipsticks
which is one of my favorite things this
video suggestion it came from Anika on
my snapchat she sent me a snap and said
that she had just watched Gracie ends
video on all of the lipsticks that she
wore in February so she did 28 lipsticks
and 28 days and she did like a lip
swatch video I of course will have it
linked down below and Anika said that
she would love to see that video from me
so I went over and I watched her video
and I was like what a fun cute idea to
look back and see what lipsticks you
wore throughout the month so I wanted to
do something similar to that her video
is more of just like a traditional lip
swatch video which is awesome you guys
know me and I like to talk so that's
gonna be doing but I went through all of
my videos that I post it in February I
posted 25 videos out of 28 days in
February and I'm gonna talk about all of
the lipsticks that I wore each day I'll
also do a swatch as well and then insert
the photo of me from of that video so
you can see what the lipstick looks like
on me as well but I understand it would
be a fun cute idea so I decided that's
what I wanted to film for today so if
you want to see all of the lipsticks
that I wore in my February videos here
on YouTube why don't I go ahead and get
started so first up February 1st I
posted a throwback a Thursday tutorial
and I was using a lot of like my
throwback makeup items so of course it
makes sense that for my lip color I
chose NYX London this is one of my
favorite lip colors and it has been for
a very long time this is in the soft
matte lip cream formula and it's just
one of my favorite nudes it made it into
my top 20 favorite nudes video that I
did here recently I really just need to
call it quits on this one because I can
barely get any product out but there is
NYX London again just one of my favorite
nudes so yeah of course that one was in
there another one that made it into my
top a 20 video it's I wanted to do this
video mostly because I wanted to look
back and see like how many of my
favorite brands did I reach for how many
of my favorite shades did I reach for
and I thought the list was pretty
interesting in my opinion of course this
one is the huda beauty lipstick in
whyphy this was from my dethroned makeup
a product video again this is one of my
favorite news huda beauty has one of my
favorite liquid lipstick
Ornelas and wifey is kind of just like
my my tones right now I find myself
searching for this one a lot not even
just in YouTube videos oh good it's
snowing just in YouTube videos but in
real life who'da white becomes with me
quite a bit and then next up we had a
whole video that I did and I wore a dose
of colors like with lipstick again
favorite formula of mine and this shade
is in rosebud when this one is a really
cool cool toned a pinkish shade or is
what rosebud looks like when I'm just
kind of feeling like I want to do
something a little bit out of the box
like not too crazy
I'll reach a for rosebud from a dose of
colors on a February 4th I posted the
one shade in a challenge palette with
the yesplease palette and was a very
like orange II kind of sunset II look
and I paired it with the fenty Beauty
lipstick this is one of the new
mademoiselle lipsticks and I picked up
the shade up to no good I will be
reviewing this one shortly because I did
pick it up in my most recent haul and I
have my follow-up video on schedule for
the next couple of days here this one is
a really interesting color when I first
got it and i swatched it i was like you
know why I'm not sure I'm gonna love it
but I do like it it's a really
interesting orange color I know it's not
for everybody I posted a couple photos
of me on Instagram and while most people
were like yes love that color some
people are like mmm I'm not sure what I
feel about Laura lipsticks and I'm like
I get it I understand it but sometimes
when you're doing like an all orange
look I feel like it just goes along
really well with it so that one is Fenty
up to no good
February 5th I posted a makeup a monthly
video would have been my January makeup
monthly and I wore Kat Von D
bow-and-arrow one of my favorite
lipstick staple shades this one was also
mentioned in my top 20 lip video it's
just interesting to see which one's out
of my favorites made it so there is Kat
Von D a bow and arrow right there so you
can see kind of the first array of
colors that I chose in February so
moving on to February 6 I did the
recreating a makeup look and I took
inspiration from Babs beauty and a
Valentine's Day tutorial that she did I
didn't have the exact lip products that
she used in that video so I kind of made
my own concoction
for my liquid lipstick I used the C F de
London this is their velvet liquid
velvet
lipstick and this is in the shade
bittersweet this came in a Sephora lip
set and
you really like this color it's a really
cool like a cool toned I feel like I
always said it cool before I say cool
toned like every time but it's a cool
toned kind of like dark grayish color if
you will so that's what it looks like
there and I paired it with the buxom
lipgloss in white Russian and let me
tell you guys a story because I can't
find it and it used to be in a specific
spot
I remember where it used to be with my
NYX lipsticks and I have two buxom lip
glosses I have white Russian and I have
dolly and they were in with all of my
NYX lipsticks and I remember the other
day I was rearranging and I thought
these don't belong there first of all
their lip glosses and their high-end and
their with my NYX soft matte lip creams
this doesn't make any sense
so I moved them so that they would be in
a better location and now I can't find
them I've been looking all over my
office like where did I put those and
because they're both gone I remember
I've moved them both but I don't know
where I even checked my purse just to
make sure because I do wear white brush
and quite a bit I can't find it and I'm
so pressure with myself so I'm gonna
have to really like tear apart my office
and figure out where was my brilliant
idea to move these lip glosses to it
that I can't find them has anyone else
done that this is why I don't rearrange
this is why I don't organize because
then I lose things I knew exactly where
they were before and now I don't know
but that is the lip combo that I did
that day February 7th I posted a bullet
by it video and I wore oh it just got
darker perfect hold please let me grab
out my ring light okay I'm back even
though it's snowing apparently got
really dark all of a sudden I get so
focused sometimes that I forget to check
the viewfinder just to make sure like
can you see me and I am frame and my
blurry I don't know and I looked up and
it was dark I was like whoa okay then um
but like I was saying I wore this Kat
Von D Cathedral lipstick these are one
of her they changed names recently but
this one is a studded kiss lipstick I
think it's now called like studded creme
lipstick is her new formula but this one
is in a Cathedral I really like the Kat
Von D lipsticks I like her liquid
lipsticks but I also really like this
formula also and I know a lot of people
are saying that they really like the new
one too so I'm excited to give those a
try but there is Cathedral now let's see
where did I leave off oh and February
8th
I posted my the gift card the 200 dollar
gift card
comparing high-end to affordable and I
wore the CIA London and the elusive
White Russian glass in that video a lot
of times I will film multiple videos in
one day because I post 6 to 7 days a
week and I can't film 6 to 7 days a week
and I do try to give myself the weekends
off from filming to just like be in the
moment and be with my husband and all of
that so a lot of times I will film two
videos during the week so a lot of times
I will change my lip color but I must
have really loved to that lip
combination so much I kept it on and
then let's see February night I posted a
first impression video and the one the
lipstick that I chose in that first
impression video is this one from pixie
this is their Matt last liquid lip and
this shade is in pastel petal these
again I will be doing a full review
coming up here shortly because I'm going
to combine my latest haul with this
first impression video and I'm going to
review all of the items from there in
that follow-up video so my full review
will be coming but there is pastel pedal
but these pixie lipsticks are really
really good you guys I've been very very
impressed with these pixie lipsticks and
I love that they have a bunch of nude
and like pinky nude shades beautiful and
next up I once again on February 11th I
did my March musings video which I have
another one coming up here shortly
I again wore fenty up to no good I had a
really orange eye Lagaan I've been
really until orange looks also like I
was saying earlier so I had a very
orange eye look from the I believe was
the violet boss hashtag palette so I
paired it with the fun tea up to no good
again I'm reviewing it so I've been
wearing it several times and so I can
get my review coming for it
February 12th I did the makeup style tag
and I once again wore the pixie lipstick
that I was just mentioning that's
another one that I think I filmed yes I
would have because I did a first
impression video and since I did my
makeup on there that is when I will
typically always film a second video
just so I do a video in that full face
makeup look so that is when I wore this
pixie one again on February 13th I
posted an empties video and I wore the
Marc Jacobs truth rbair lipstick this is
called the Lamarck liquid
lip creme I have this is the only one I
have in the liquid lip crema but I also
have the Lamarck creme lipsticks not the
liquid ones just the regular ones really
really love that formula but this one is
really nice too and I really like this
pinky rosy color I really like a lot of
Marc Jacobs lip products a lot so there
is that one from Marc Jacobs sorry if
now the swatches look a little crazy
because I had to turn my ring light on
but hopefully they won't be too skewed
and I should be inserting pictures as
well but that one is from Marc Beauty
February 4th on a Valentine's Day I
posted it will I buy it oh that's nice
and romantic I wore a dose of colors a
combination in there I think I've worn
those colors one other time and now I
have two more products they're both from
dose of colors the liquid lipstick I
used was let's cuddle this is from my
holiday set and I'm fairly confident
that I just saw that those individual
shades have come back now I don't know
if it's just on the dos website so far
if they've made it to Ulta but the
shades like I've been saying those
shades that were in the holiday sets I
believed we're coming back as
individuals and I think that they have
now which has me so very excited so this
is let's cuddle from dose of colors and
then I put a lip gloss over it this is
one of their new lip glosses and honey
I'm home again I'm going to be reviewing
this one coming up here shortly but I
feel like these glosses would go well
together cuz they're both like nude with
like a little bit of like peach to them
so there's the liquid lipstick and then
this last one here is the honey I'm home
at gloss I will say just like a sneak
peek of my review video I don't really
love the gloss which I'm bummed about
I love the liquid lipsticks from them
but the glass I wasn't as huge of a fan
of so if everywhere you 15th is when I
posted my top 20 nude and pink lipstick
shades and so I was doing like lip
swatches in that video but for the
talking portion of the video the
lipstick that I was wearing during then
was maybelline truffle tease which
obviously was featured in the video this
is like one of my most old-school
lipsticks that I love so much I love the
color I love the Maybelline formula I'm
just really like this is just one of my
favorite drugstore lipsticks hands down
and it has been for like I don't know
five years six years something crazy
like that but I do love me some truffle
tease on the 16th I posted it get ready
with me and I
right out of this liquid lipstick from
Wallis beauty this is in George and I
instantly fell in love I had to get
George out of my purse for this video
because I really enjoyed this liquid
lipstick formula I just mentioned them
in my latest makeup monthly video and I
put it in the favorites section I super
long-lasting super opaque liquid
lipstick very comfortable on the lips I
love George I love this color so much
the liquid lipstick smells like candy
which makes you girl happy right here
but I'm very impressed with these look
at lipsticks and they were coming to
Sephora soon I seriously check every
single day of when they're coming to
Sephora because I want another liquid
lipstick for sure and then on the next
video that I post it was February 18th I
posted products I regret buying and I
was wearing George again again because I
filmed the get ready with me then I went
on to film another video so I was in the
same makeup so I weren't George but the
next video that I posted on the 19th was
a March Madness video and I wore a
lawless Beauty lipstick once again this
one isn't Dayne I'm telling you when I
tried out that first liquid lipstick
from Wallace Beauty I then wore it we
went out that weekend and I we went out
Friday and Saturday which is unuseful
and I work George both nights that's how
much I love George but for the next
video that I did I went back to a
lawless Beauty lipstick this one is in
Dane this one is a much more like vampy
like really deep wine color it's really
beautiful and again like sometimes I get
a little nervous with darker lip colors
because I feel like they warm is
fluttering on the lips err and there's
just something about darker lip colors
that I'm not a hundred percent on but
this looked really good on the lips
again very long-lasting I'm really
impressed with Wallace Beauty I'm so it
was funny to see lawless George flawless
George lawless days I was like okay
there we go
February 20th I posted my how much does
drugstore makeup cost and I wore color
pop beeper I had I'm my gosh even before
I started to say this sentence I got
tears of my eyes I had a really cool
opportunity this past month to work with
uLTA Beauty and color pop on some
Instagram post color pop is now being
sold at Ulta
and I somehow was selected to be a
person to help make that announcement so
I got to work with both colour-pop and
Ulta and it was a really exciting day
for me um it was so cool and thank you
guys for for watching and supporting and
let me have those cool opportunities
because to get to say that I worked with
uLTA Beauty on the campaign is like one
of the craziest things ever to be uLTA
Beauty actually reposted my photo on
their Instagram page which that was such
a I remember screaming and like running
out to the kitchen to Mitch who like
he'd been so excited for me all day and
he was coming in because we had to post
it like a specific time and he was
coming in like are you ready are you
ready to post I'm like I'm ready I'm
ready to do this I was so excited so
then to see like I was one of the girls
on the campaign that also reposted I was
like home or gosh but they sent me a
package of a few color pop items and
eyeshadow palette the flexitarian
highlight and then also two liquid
lipsticks and this one is in beeper and
beepers like that old-school like
classic color pop shade when the ultra
mattes were coming out and everybody was
dying over them because they're only six
dollars and they're a liquid lipstick I
mean everybody lost their minds over
these color pop lipsticks your girl
included I did have beeper from a long
time ago it was probably one of the
first color pop matte lipsticks that I
purchased but I have since decluttered
it my only gripe with the colour-pop
liquid lipsticks is that I don't feel
like they have a very long shelf life
and I have a huge lipstick collection so
I would prefer to have lipsticks that
are gonna keep for a little bit longer I
mean they are really affordable at $6 so
and beeper once I put it on again I was
like yes this was one of my favorite
shades and a good thing about the color
pop the formula which the formula does
change a lot which is pretty frustrating
but especially with this one in
particular then I just tried out which
I'm assuming is a newer formula it
really does stay because I remember the
day that I did my makeup to take like my
photos and stuff for Instagram my
husband was home and he asked if I
wanted to get lunch
I said yes I I still wanted to film a
video after I'd done all my makeup so I
was like well let's go you lunch before
and then I'll come home and film and I
was wearing this liquid lipstick and I
really didn't want to have to like
reapply it so I was like I'll just be
really good and get a salad and
said I got a burger and I was like yep
you're gonna have to do something with
your lipstick no it held up it looked
just fine the video that I posted which
would have been what video was I wearing
this one in my drugstore
what does drugstore money cost that's
what this lipstick look like after
eating a burger I think that's pretty
impressive so this is Bieber it's just
one of those really cool it's just one
of those like cool shades you know I'm
really happy that I have it back
actually cuz I really do like that shade
let's see next up so I wore color pop
paper I wore another color pop lipstick
this one was on February 21st and
another will i buy it videos is one of
the new color pop luxe matte lipsticks
and that came out I actually got a
really cool package from Babs Beauty and
other Beauty influencers she's gonna be
a really sweet package and it had a
couple of these colourpop lip sticks
inside which I was excited to be able to
try them out to give my review of them
so this one is what was this called am
still crazy so here's what that one
looks like these lipsticks I kind of
touched on them a little bit in one of
my past videos where I was wearing
another one that's gonna come up here
but to me the formula is like
inconsistent this one even swatching it
like it's watches creamy but it kind of
stays creamy and it kind of has that
Sheen throughout the day where I don't
think it's completely matte but then
another lipstick again that we'll talk
about in a second it's like really matte
on the lips it's not too hard to apply
which sometimes it's frustrating with my
lipsticks but it's definitely harder to
apply and it's completely matte on the
lips
we're just confusing to me I actually
like this one I like this color and I
like the way it feels on the lips I like
the way it looks so I don't know that's
just something that's kind of confusing
who has tried out the color pop
lipsticks and did you find that same
thing like did you try multiple shades
so that's kind of weird to me but that
is color pop is still crazy on the 22nd
I posted a oh my fat fun video can't
read my own handwriting and I wore this
little guide this is from Burberry and
it's the nude lipstick I think I wrote
nude beige in my description box but I
believe it's just called nude I really
like these little Burberry lipsticks I
actually have another
Burberry lipstick as well that's more of
like a regular kind of like a velvet
liquid lipstick and I really like that
one too they're just really expensive I
think this little guy I think it came in
a set actually that I got but there is
what Burberry
dude it looks like it's it's a very nude
it has a little bit of brown undertones
to it but I do enjoy that one and then
the 23rd I posted the forearm or tag and
I wore another color pop lipstick I
actually tagged it incorrectly in my
description box I realized the shade
that I wore is called humble pie which
was that really bright pink I have
another one from colour-pop that's also
pretty darn pink but not quite as like
this hot Barbie pink so that is the one
that I wore in that video and you can
see like that one is super super bright
hopefully it's still okay with the ring
light but that one is humble pie from
colour-pop and this is one that I feel
like it's just much more matte looks and
that applies more matte so I don't know
it's just I don't know it's just weird
that was a really interesting the lip
color to wear I had a pretty pink eye
look on like like pretty pink not like
pretty and pink like it was not fairly
pink I look and then I paired it with
this and I remember putting this on I
was like oh I think that's too pink for
me and I was like you know what just go
for it like it's makeup it's lipstick
have fun and then of course someone
someone commented and actually said
people might not subscribe to your
channel if they see that makeup look
yeah doesn't care on de 25th I posted my
gift card guide video and I board this
Urban Decay backtalk lipstick which is
what I'm wearing today I love this color
so much I think it's so beautiful I
really enjoyed these Urban Decay
lipsticks I mentioned bun-bun in my top
20 shades video backtalk is another one
of the comfort matte lipsticks and again
what I do I use I feel like they're
super comfortable they're really
flattering on the lips they are matte
but they're not too matte they're not
like that gross drying matte they don't
make my lips like flake or do weird
things and I enjoy this color so freakin
much it's also called a back tuck and
I'm excited for the back talk palette
that's coming out soon can't wait can't
wait
gonna get it gonna get it but yes
everybody Kay back talk loving the shade
on the 26 I posted a March Madness video
and I wore the hood of beauty sugar mama
lipstick again who does the favorite of
mine it wasn't surprised to see her
twice in this video I really enjoy sugar
mama
but I think it's really flattering and
really beautiful I like these who to
minis I have quite a few of them but I
really enjoy that formula and then the
twenty-seventh I wore I did my overlook
to make a products video and I wore the
dose of colors honey I'm home with gloss
I worked just by itself I did it's such
a natural look that day I got so many
good compliments on my makeup that day
thank you so much I was mostly focused
on like my skin I had very minimal eye
makeup on no lashes and then I just did
that gloss it's pretty pigmented on its
own for a gloss but again I think it's
just okay wasn't my favorite on the 28th
I posted another will I buy it and once
again I wore color cups still crazy
which is kind of funny other day that
was in too will in my videos girl what
are you doing mix it up mix it up again
I've been trying to try out the color
pop Lux lipsticks so I can review them
so that's why I wear them multiple times
but after that those are the 25
lipsticks I wore throughout all of my
February YouTube videos okay so that may
be everything for today's video all
about the lipstick shades that I chose
to wear in my February videos it was
really fun for me to look back on I
wasn't surprised to see multiples of
like my favorite brands dose of colors
huda beauty Kat Von D was in there
multiple times yeah that was fun for me
if you guys like the style a video do
let me know I don't think I would be
able to do it every single month just
cuz I have so many videos out there that
I want to do but maybe you know like
every few months or so I could come back
and revisit either the lipsticks I wore
maybe the eyeshadow palettes highlights
I mean anything like that let me know if
you'd want to see more of these and
again I will have draya's video linked
in my description box it down below I
thought this was a really fun idea and
when I watched her video I wanted to do
something similar to it so I'll make
sure you go check out her channel as
well let her know that I sent you let me
your feedback down below and also of
course let me know if any other videos
that you would like to see on my channel
but as always if you guys did enjoy this
one I hope that you'll give it a thumbs
up I hope that you will also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys in at tomorrow's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
