I'm excited for today's video could be a
little bit different I feel like I start
off so many of my videos saying that but
this is going to be I believe the first
video where I'm talking not really about
makeover beauty but I'm talking more
about fitness so I'm going to be going
over kind of like what I do for fitness
like why I started working out bd's I
use apps I use websites i use tools that
I you again I will try to make this
video as quick as I can I know I can
tend to ramble but i'll try to get
through it as fast as i can there is
going to be a giveaway at the end so
make sure you stay tuned for that but
basically i decided to do this video
because i filmed a summer lookbook a
couple months ago and i do a segment in
there wearing like workout clothes and
i'm showing a part of like a yoga
workout that i do and i got so many
questions about my fitness routine about
how many times I work out I started
putting it more on my snapchat what
workouts that I'm doing each day or
showing little like clips are photos
from my workouts I don't go to a gym and
I'll have a trainer I work from home I
don't have anyone here to like film me
working out but I tried to show little
clips of it on my snapchat and I just
have been getting flooded with so many
different questions so I thought why not
make this video and let you guys know so
I'm excited for it I had to share this
with you because fitness is a really
really big part of my life and it has
been for so many years so I'm excited to
kind of talk to you guys about this but
yeah so first let's hop into why I got
into fitness always into like dance and
gymnastics I was a cheerleader off
throughout high school so I always liked
found fitness in those ways and I felt
like especially when I was a kid growing
up and we didn't have cellphones and TV
and Pokemon go and everything like that
it was so much easier to be outside and
doing sports and and playing and just
getting your energy out that way it was
actually a senior in high school and I
went in for like my regular physical and
I got told that I had very high
cholesterol like alarmingly high
cholesterol and when I was in high
school I was tiny like me my brother and
my sister we are we were just very small
humans when we were younger because I'm
just genetic so we have really nothing
else to think I don't
Thank except for genetics all three of
us were very very small so to be told as
an 18 year old who didn't eat terrible
who did participate in cheerleading and
who wasn't overweight that they had
alarmingly high cholesterol was pretty
strange usually when you hear high
cholesterol it's maybe someone who eats
really bad or who is overweight but
unfortunately just like being thin runs
in the family so does high cholesterol
so does heart disease etc so I was
dealing with something that was
hereditary and so the doctors actually
like SAT me down and told me you know
you you need to like step up your
workout game and I also needed to start
paying more attention to what I was
eating I cut out certain foods I brought
in certain foods I made little changes
with like the bread I was eating the
milk I was drinking things like that I
actually cut fast food out entirely my
senior year of high school it was very
difficult but i did it i started doing
daily walks with my mom like I really
did take that seriously because it's my
health it's my life and no one else was
going to make that change for me they
had the genetics going against me so why
give the the genes any more ammunition
by eating McDonald's every day and
sitting on my couch at night like I knew
that I needed to make a change so I just
went out and bought a bunch of DVDs what
I found worked for me was just working
out in my living room pinay was 18 years
old us in high school I couldn't really
afford like a fancy gym or trainer at
that point we had access to the weight
room since I was a cheerleader I would
go to the weight room a little bit more
but I was always very uncomfortable
especially because there was always like
the football players around and I was
like so I preferred dvds in my living
room and I preferred like the dance ones
upbeat ones and it ended up just being
something that was really fun for me and
I would end up looking forward to my
workouts I found that I was feeling
better I found that I was even looking
better even though like I said I was
very very thin in high school I started
to look toned so I didn't just look like
a stick figure like I actually had some
sort of body going on and I actually
really liked that so that's just a
little background of why I got into
fitness I definitely encourage anyone
you know if you know that you have some
sort of like genetic somewhere along the
why like pay attention to that and do
what you can because honestly it was a
big wake-up call for me be grateful for
that wake-up call and of course
obviously knowing about my health
because it's still something that I
think about today because obviously it
still runs in the family i still have
the chance my cholesterol is now under
control i'm very happy to say i get it
checked every year i'm doing well and I
think it's because of the lifestyle that
I leave now just a little bit about why
I started getting into fitness and how I
ended up actually falling in love with
it I carried on with me through college
I actually started working at the
activity center at my college basically
like our gym and I was able to take
advantage of that I college student we
were able to utilize the gym for free
and since I would be there working a lot
of times it was either before I started
a shift or after I started a shift i
would just went to the gym and get a
workout in and ended up working out
really well for me since then I just do
nearly daily workouts I'm not going to
say that i'm perfect i'm not going to
say when I go on vacation or I'm gone
for the holidays that I work out every
single day because that's not the case
but really since that time in high
school I have a very dedicated workout
plan you know I don't do anything crazy
I don't go to the gym I've never had a
trainer i do everything from the comfort
of my own home because i have found that
is what works best for me and when it
comes to fitness I just recommend
finding what works best for you some
people like to go to a gym some people
enjoy going to classes and that's
fantastic some people need a trainer and
can afford a trainer it's really
wherever your comfort zone lies but if
you are someone like me and you don't
like the gym or you don't like classes
you can't afford the trainer and you
want to work out from home but you don't
really know how or what tools you'll
need that's what I'm going to go through
next I'm just going to show you what I
have basically is like my home gym the
dvds that i use and the website that i
use every single day and so yeah let's
hop into that next guys through some of
my favorite DVDs some of these I oh man
some of these are old but you know what
I still use them so I'm gonna walk
through some of my favorite ones now
these two are definitely the oldest in
my collection i bought these when i
still lived on campus at college which
would have been like circa 2000 but they
are from shay
so you know shape magazine obviously I
used to like get shape magazine and read
it all the time so when I was at like
Target or walgreens or something and I
saw these I was like hey I read shape
I'm going to buy the dvds so one is a
toning workout it says it's like a
bikini body workout I'm pretty sure you
can still get these on Amazon and i'll
link them because like i said i still do
them one is a 20 minute makeover this
one because it has like a workout for
your arms I workout for your abs lower
body and cardio conditioning and then
this one also includes like a bonus like
cardio workout which i think is really
cool but I like these because especially
like this one how it says it's a 20
minute makeover like they're just fast
workouts and that's what I found even
before I got into like the adult world
and I was still at college I wouldn't
have a lot of time to dedicate to my
workouts like sometimes I don't have an
hour to sit down and work out i have 20
minutes i have 30 minutes I want to do
something quick and fast and that's what
I found these dvds worked really well
for ya these are the two that I did in
my dorm and I decided to go a little
crazy like once I once I felt
comfortable though so I was like you
know what I can mix in a few more things
I actually started taking a kickboxing
class that was offered through my
college and I found that I really enjoy
kickboxing and then I found mr. Billy
Blanks mr. Billy Blanks is no joke let
me just say that right now but I bought
his tie bow workouts so we have total
body fat blaster and fat blasting cardio
these workouts are incredibly hard when
I need my ass kicked even to this day
these are what i buy i remember i bought
the both of these i was still in college
but i just moved off campus so now we're
like 2007-2008 that i bought these and i
still use them they are so freaking hard
like do not go into this thinking you're
going to have a casual work out because
you're not because you might die that
literally the first time that i did this
i remember that i hadn't eaten much that
day and I was pretty hungry but I was
like I'm gonna try this new workout I
don't remember if I did the purple or
the red but I threw up afterwards I was
not prepared for the ass-kicking that
mr. Billy Blanks gives you he is tough
now these videos are long I think
they're like
our long workouts maybe even okay so
this one says it's 55 minutes and this
one's 46 so about our long workouts and
they are non-stop like you are going you
are rolling one of them I think it's one
of them that you use resistance bands
maybe both no I think both you use
resistance bands they're just they're
hard I still use them to this day I
definitely will try to find these and
link these down below because they're
pretty bomb so from billy blanks i
graduated to another very hard personal
trainer and her name you may have heard
of her is Jillian Michaels Jillian
Michaels is also no joke and she likes
to yell at you just like mr. Billy
Blanks does but her workout I really
enjoy the first one that I was
introduced to from jillian is the 30 day
shred so I have to keep looking at the
viewfinder cuz I don't know if I'm
blinding you guys but it's the 30 day
shred so many people talk about the 30
day shred and I feel like everybody
needs this workout DVD I'll be
completely honest with you guys I think
everyone needs this month I like the 30
day shred I like it has the three
minutes of strength two minutes of
cardio one minute abs there's warm up
their school down there's different
levels that you can choose from you know
if you're more beginner if you're more
advanced and they're just tough and
again I like it because it's a I think
overall it's a 20 minute workout yep 20
minute workout and I like the way it's
broken down it's because it's very like
you do this you do this you do this so
even like there's been times where I've
traveled I've gone somewhere and I can't
pop a DVD in I can recall the moves that
we're doing in the 30 day shred and I
can do them on my own without even the
DVD you know it's a little less
stressful cuz i don't have Jillian
yelling at me but it's nice because I
can still get that workout in so I
highly recommend the 30 day shred a lot
of times when I do the 30 day shred if I
do it in the 30 day window which I've
done that several several times that I
will dedicate an entire month to jillian
michaels and a lot of times I do it with
like a friend and we can text each other
every day or skype each other like did
my workout today the shred today and
it's nice because you have that like
accountability with your friend even
though you're not going to a gym and
meeting up
you're doing this at your house but
you're still being able to do it
together I think it's really cool so
hugely hugely recommend the 30 day shred
the other one that I picked up from her
is the yoga meltdown this is also a
really really good DVD and it's not just
yoga so I'm also a big yoga I haven't
talked about that yet but i'll try to
touch on it if i'm not going to along
here but I'm very much into yoga I like
this because it's not traditional and
yoga like yoga flows and yoga stretches
things like that like yes it's yoga
poses but it's mostly static yoga poses
and then you're building in cardio and
strength of with it and you're kind of
like are getting the best of both worlds
and again the DVD is broken down very
easily so again if I'm going to go
somewhere but I can't bring a DVD or
watch a DVD I can remember the moves
that we've done in the yoga meltdown and
I can do them there too I really enjoy
it it's definitely a different kind of
workout but if you will feel the burn
with the yoga meltdown so definitely
recommend this one from Jillian as well
like i mentioned i do practice yoga um i
really i first got into pilates back
when i was in high school some of my
first dvds that i bought for my house
like i mentioned more like dance but
also a lot of pilates yoga started
getting pretty big you know like
probably when I was in college like
everybody wanted to do yoga all of a
sudden I took a couple of yoga classes
like with my sister-in-law and friends
I've done hot yoga and then it was in i
think it was like 2014 i actually
started an Instagram fitness page with
my friend Holly where the cheeky chicks
on Instagram and we just started getting
really into yoga together and
participating in like yoga challenges on
Instagram and it's been a lot of fun I
really enjoy doing it and it's
definitely kept me motivated to work out
every day and continually practice yoga
but not just for social media or an
Instagram page I realized how much I
enjoyed yoga how good yoga has made me
feel and just how much more positive i
feel like i am since starting yoga
because yoga is a lot more than just
like stretching i have been able to do
things with my body that I didn't think
I would ever be able to do some of the
things that I have learned throughout
yoga and
to treat my body and it's just been it's
just been pretty incredible but also
there's definitely such a huge
positivity focus when it comes to yoga
and I definitely feel like that's had a
really big impact in my life it's been
helpful with yoga to be able to calm
down I'm constantly multitasking and I
just run on a high level I'm constantly
doing something or doing four things at
one time and I always have eight browser
windows pulled up I get told on snapchat
all the time when I'm doing something on
my computer and I'm showing you guys
people are like how many windows do you
have open and I'm like at least eight I
don't it's just I don't know what to do
that's just how I roll yoga helps keep
me balanced in a way where when I
practice yoga it's time to just calm
down and chill out and just focus you
know so it's really really been very
helpful it's really nice too because I
can definitely tell changes in my body
as well so I really really enjoy yoga
and a lot of people ask me how did I get
start it I went to a couple classes and
then I bought DVDs one of the first DVDs
that I have bought isn't of yoga flow
with tara lee this is what it looks like
and I think it's really good for
beginners too so this is one that I am
constantly recommending I believe I can
I found it on amazon before because i
recommend this quite a bit people in to
share links with them but yeah i will
leave it linked in the bottom bar below
as well but this was a really good DVD
that kind of helped me out or it'll kind
of lead me to one of the biggest things
that i wanted to talk about with my
fitness and if you follow me on snapchat
you probably know what i'm going to talk
about because I share my workouts that I
do with you each day but this really
helped me with my yoga especially it's a
website called Crocker it's gr 0 ke ke R
I will leave it linked in the
description box below but about two
years ago right around the time that I
started really getting into fitness and
social media that I found this website
and it was all free at the time now
there is like a membership fee to pay
but it was free at the time that I
joined but it's something that I use
every single day it's just a website
filled with what are called experts like
professionals in the workout industry
and they have different videos on there
for you to follow along with I do a ton
of yoga on there right now I'm doing
Celeste I'm
try to pronounce her last name but I can
link her profile below right now I'm
currently going through a couple of her
yoga series but there's also fitness and
there there's dance and they're like for
yoga there's different ways to break
down certain poses that you want to do
how to learn how to handstand there's
great instructional videos that I use
all the time in my practice because I
don't necessarily want to go to a class
like I said I'm just a big class person
I i wish i was sometimes but I'm just
simply not so being able to do these
instructional videos in the privacy of
my living room I really really
appreciate but there's also a ton of
good fitness videos on there too I love
Sara cush and I have talked about her so
much on snapchat and on social media
because her workouts kick your ass she's
like the female version of Billy Blanks
like except she doesn't yell as much
she's just incredibly hard her workouts
are so so challenging I think she has
two different series on Gawker and I've
gone through both repeatedly repeatedly
repeatedly because I cannot get enough
of them I will also leave her profile
for Gawker linked down below because she
is amazing so the two that I kind of
going back and forth through right now
but I have done so many different
trainers and videos and it's it's really
cool to find a website that I can like I
can just put on my phone and I put my
phone like by the TV stand grab my yoga
mat or my tennis shoes are my weights or
whatever it is that I need for that
video and just be able to work out it's
fantastic i recommend crocker all of the
time like seriously ironic punk rocker
all the time so when I thought that I
was going to do this video I actually
reached out to rocker this video is not
sponsored I'm not being paid to say any
of this I've just spent a huge fan of
Crocker for several years and it's
something that I recommend all the time
and I told them hey I'm planning on
doing this video and I'm going to talk
about your website a lot is there
anything that we can do to work together
and her name was leslie she got back to
me and said that they wanted to do a
giveaway for one of my subscribers that
was incredible that's something that
they definitely didn't have to do they
did not have to get back to be at all if
they didn't want to but they wanted to
offer up a giveaway for a
3-month subscription to grok or so you
can try it out and see if you like it I
think that's super cool and really
amazing i'm really excited to bring you
this giveaway it will be linked in the
description box below it's going to be
like pretty typical of my giveaway stuff
will be like a widget that you fill out
because then that widget will randomly
pick a winner at the end I just gets the
fairest thing of all so I will just ask

with Crocker so if you would want to try
it out again I will leave that link
below that is an affiliate link just so
you do know so if you do decide to do a
14 day trial a you know thank you but be
I'm really excited because like I said
this is something that I've been using
for years and years and I just I love it
so much i recommend it to everybody if
you follow me on my snapchat you know
that i just wanted to share what works
the best for me typically i like to work
out in the morning because usually in
the afternoons this is like when I film
because i use natural lighting this is
usually when the lighting is the best
for me so in the afternoons i typically
have my makeup on and i don't like to
work out makeup I definitely don't
recommend working out in makeup because
it's not good for your skin so I usually
start my day and I get my home office I
do my work I eat my breakfast and then
it's usually about half hour to 40
minutes after that is when I do my
workout I just go in my living room I
have my yoga mat there and I have a
bunch of different tools that I work out
with that I want it to run through
really quick so in addition to the dvds
i also have a couple of resistance bands
this is one that I have looks like this
it has like handles at the end I step on
the the band and you can do like arms
with them you can wrap it around your
legs and do leg swings with them I
really like these especially like the
handles i bought this from sports
authority for my Billy Blanks work out
because you do need resistance bands
with handles for that workout but I find
myself using these all the time and then
the other resistance band I have it
actually came in a Pilates DVD it was
like a special edition breast cancer one
so it came with this pink resistance
band now this doesn't have any handles
but it is really good in Pilates even
like 100 is something that's really
common in Pilates where you're laying
down your legs are like at a 45 degree
angle and you like flap your arms up and
down a hundred times you can even do
something like that with the resistance
band but even just to like sit at your
desk if you work at a desk job have a
resistance band and just do this a
couple times a day you're stretching out
your arms you're getting a worked out
you're like can shake out your wrist
trust me guys i work at my computer like
this all day long and it's horrible for
my posture so when I take those breaks
to work out or even if I just grab
something as simple as a resistance band
that you can buy it like Target and just
do a couple of workouts you can put it
behind your head and do one of these two
to work on different areas of your arm
you can wrap the resistance band around
your legs and kind of like I know you
can't see my knees but kind of push your
legs out and in and out and in and get a
thigh workout it's so easy you don't
have to even dedicate 20 minutes of your
time to do that take a five-minute break
at your desk grab a resistance band go
crazy so a big thing that I recommend
having is just a set of weights I have
three pound weights and five-pound
weights these are really good obviously
for your arms you can do several
different workouts with these there are
so many different things that you can do
with the weights and a lot of workouts
will call for weights like I said I have
three pounds and I have five pounds and
i also have a 10-pound kettle ball
kettlebell workouts are no joke yo guys
i actually had a DVD that was all for
kettle balls so i went out again at
sports authority my boy or my boyfriend
he was my boyfriend at the time my
husband he actually worked in a sports
authority when we were in college so it
got a lot of stuff they're i'm pretty
sure they're closed now but that's where
i got a lot of myself after I got my
kettlebell as well but um kettlebell
workouts are incredibly difficult in my
opinion I think I actually don't do them
a ton but it's really nice to have this
on hand for one I do want them if you do
want to get into yoga I recommend having
some yoga blocks I think I have like two
or four yoga blocks I just got them from
target as well and they're not very
expensive these really help especially
when learning like arm balances I
actually rely on even still now I've
been practicing for two years there are
still some arm balances that I rely on
my blocks for and I just use them quite
a bit so definitely if you're getting it
to yoga think
about picking up some yoga blocks
because they can be super helpful
they're just a few tools that I have I
actually do have a treadmill because
like I said I don't go to the gym so in
the winter time when I'm not able to go
on walks with my dog it's really nice to
be able to go around my basement and
either walk or run I honestly am NOT a
big runner and enjoy walking so much
more but I can pop into my headphones
and listen to an audiobook while I walk
on the treadmill that took me a while to
save up for treadmills are not cheap but
it was something that i saved up for a
lot and you know i don't pay for a gym
membership so that's kind of like where
i was able to justify it and you know i
actually do use it and i really do enjoy
it and even my husband is able to use it
he likes to run on it in the winters too
so I'm really really grateful that we
have a treadmill and how we have space
for a treadmill it makes me really happy
because I really basically have a home
gym you know I don't have anything fancy
I don't have a fancy setup I don't have
mirrors to look at I don't have anything
like that I have a treadmill shoved in
the corner of my basement I have a box
full of all of these products that I
just showed you and then I have a
cabinet full of workout DVDs and a yoga
mat and I just make it work and it's
just something that I'm very passionate
about has been getting asked so many
questions about my fitness routine and
what workouts that I do and what
equipment that I have and you know a lot
of times people ask like what gym do I
go to and do i use a trainer so I
thought I would just make this video and
share this with you guys go over
everything that i use and when I work
out and like I said if you work at a
desk job there is nothing wrong with
taking five minutes and stretching even
if you don't have any equipment that you
can bring with you just do stretches you
know stretch your wrist up put your arms
over your head and stretch reach down
touch your toes do anything that you can
to try to get some movement in your body
is a huge thing that I've learned since
transitioning to working full-time at a
desk and not being able to get up as
much so that's something that really
helps me out but really you can work out
any time anywhere you can go on walks
you know walking with my family is a
really big thing but i'll even sometimes
like when I'm standing in the kitchen
talking my husband I'll put my hands on
the counter and do like a couple
push-ups on the counter it's not
something that I do all the time but
when I have a few moments to spare yeah
sure I'll do that or I'll put my hands
like on the back of the counter and do
like tricep dips
that I do that to all the time like
there's no reason that you can't find
little ways to bring workouts into your
daily life like that's what I think and
obviously the health benefits are
fantastic you know yes your body will
probably look better of course you have
to think about your other lifestyles
that you're doing it and how you're
eating and things like that but
definitely the health benefits up there
I have seen it i went from having
alarmingly high cholesterol to how my
cholesterol is completely under control
and I definitely do credit my workouts
with a lot of that going to wrap it up
here we have a storm moving in so I'm
sure my lighting is doing crazy things
right now but because I was getting so
many questions on my workouts how I work
out what my home equipment is and
especially when I tell people I don't go
to a gym and I do everything at home I
get even more questions of how it is
that I do it so I really hope you guys
found this video somewhat informative I
hope I didn't make it too long but I
just wanted to touch on everything that
I thought was important in to share with
my workout journey so everything that I
talked about I will try my hardest to
