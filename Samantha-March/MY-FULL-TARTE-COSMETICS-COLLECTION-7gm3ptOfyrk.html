today's video is going to be a new
makeup collection video and I'm going to
be showing you guys my Tarte cosmetics
collection i started this series at the
beginning of the year each month i'm
going to pick a brand and then share
with you guys everything that i have in
my collection from that brand and i
think i've done
pure cosmetics a sigma beauty and then
also colour-pop cosmetics so the
playlist for my entire makeup collection
which includes actually going through
like foundations and bronzers I have
that from last year in my makeup
collection playlist so that will be
linked down below so from last month's
video my colour-pop video is reading
through the comments and I think the
majority vote was on Tarte cosmetics I
don't feel like I have an extremely huge
Tarte collection you know Tarte is a
little bit you know on the pricier side
but what I do have from them I really do
love and I'm excited to show you guys
everything that I have a couple items
are newer to me because they were
recently gifted to me so I'm just
excited that that's made my Tarte
collection even bigger but definitely a
brand that I really love and that I've
supported for a long time before I even
had a youtube channel I was buying from
Tarte and I really enjoyed this brand so
if you'd like to see everything in my
Tarte cosmetics collection please keep
watching so I feel like Tarte really
covers like everything when it comes to
with their brand they have so much in
there from makeup and skincare and
beauty and tools and just they have a
lot so I have a couple skincare items
and I really love both of them so one is
the pack your bags it's the under eye
rescue patches and what it is is just
under eye patches you place them on your
under eyes they're cooling they're
moisturizing they're hydrating and they
are really phenomenal I just mentioned
these in my Sephora VIP like
recommendations and my wishlist video
that I wanted to pick up more of these
because I really enjoyed them and I only
have the one pack left which is very
very sad but these are really really
amazing item that I have at first
skincare is the Tarte friction stick I
love this I was seeing a lot of hype
about it what kind of matches my nails I
was seeing a lot of hype about it when
it first came out and I was like yeah
but I don't know and then I finally
bought it I believe it was during the
VIP sale that I actually bought both of
these and I am so mad at myself
that I didn't buy it sooner because it
is really freaking phenomenal so it is
an exfoliating stick I keep mine in the
shower and like when I have conditioner
in my hair I just rub it all over my
face I usually put it on my chest let it
sit for a few minutes while I have the
conditioner in and I'm like shaving my
legs and then I wash it off it's super
convenient it's easy to even travel with
because you don't have to worry about it
like opening or anything like that
super easy to travel with it's a good
size so you can just throw it in the bag
very easy to use like I said I just
store mine in the shower and I love this
guy I have two concealers from Tarte the
first concealer that I bought from them
is the rainforest of the sea this is an
aqua concealer I also mentioned this in
my VIP video a lot of Tarte was
mentioned in that video so if you
haven't seen it yet I'll leave it listed
down below but I mentioned a lot of
heart in there because like I said I
really do enjoy this brand I definitely
want to be expanding my collection this
is what the concealer looks like and
it's definitely watery you can tell it's
a very liquidy concealer but a lot of
times I struggle with like dry under
eyes and I can get like dry patches on
the under eyes which is the worst and
then you try to put concealer on top of
it and then powder and it's like a
disaster and I love it because I feel
like this is more of almost like a
hydrating concealer it doesn't dry out
my under eyes it doesn't do anything
icky like that and I just I really enjoy
it I do reach for this concealer quite a
bit and I'm hoping to pick up the
foundation as well during the sale there
concealer I have from them I don't think
anybody's ever heard of this concealer
so I'm really excited to tell you guys
it's something new this is the Tarte
shape tape yes I was just kidding I was
just I was like trying to tap into my
funny aside there the dark shake tape
like took everybody by storm if you
don't know what the Tarte shaped tip is
this might be your first youtube video
and thank you so much for having it be
mine I appreciate it so much everybody
has fallen in love what the shape tape I
definitely one of them I have my shade
in light/medium the applicator is
absolutely crazy and huge and ginormous
it's a full coverage concealer but it's
not cakey it's it's just a really
amazing concealer when I travel I want
this guy to come with me and it's just
it's just fun it's just a great
concealer I have two lippies as well
they're both of the tardis lip paints
I really want to get their new like
hydrating lip splash lipsticks I've been
hearing so many good things about them
definitely gonna pick them up during the
sale as well but for right now I just
have the tardis lip paint formula the
first shade that I got is this hot pink
one and it is in so fetch
and it is let me tell you I'll do a
swatch of it it is hot hot pink this one
is really pretty like in the summer time
when I have a good tan going and I
mentioned this in my lipstick declutter
video that I feel like I never want to
get rid of this one because Tarte
cosmetics will also always hold a
special place in my heart because they
were the very first big brand to repost
me on Instagram and it was when I was
wearing self-etch and that's just like
it's a feeling that I feel like I won't
forget you know getting noticed by a big
brand like that but that is so fetch and
then the other Tartus lip paint I have
is in TBT which is a really nice mop
this formula I feel like it's kind of
hit or miss for people because it's not
like a traditional liquid lipstick where
it dries completely matte it can get a
little bit of transfer but it's a really
nice formula kind of moosie but to me
it's not as thick and Moosey and honest
as a liquid lipsticks because those are
just like sometimes a little bit too
much for me like it's like a good
in-between between mu C and thin it's
kind of its kind of like that in-between
leading towards mu C I'm not really
great at describing things but that is
how I would describe that but again it
doesn't dry down all the way but it's
definitely more comfortable on the lips
and you can reapply it more easily than
you can with a regular liquid lipstick
so I appreciate that so again here are
the swatches so fetch and TBT TBT is
definitely more of my favorite color out
of the two house I really like this
scent and kind of how it feels on the
lips it almost has like a peppermint
type of scent and on the lips it feels
it feels kind of tingly I don't think it
does anything like lip plumping wise I
haven't heard anything like that but I
kind of like the way that it makes my
lips feel so I definitely had to hang on
to these these did not go in my lipstick
declutter and you have the tardis lip
pains they are pretty good I'm pretty
excited I actually just got this as a
gift but I've actually gone through my
entire primer this is the clean slate
timeless smoothing primer so this is
what the little box looks like and then
here's what it looks like I actually
have this and already went through it
because I love
so much so I was really excited to get
another one this is a really nice primer
and I'm not a primer person so for me to
a go through a primer and then be say
that I would repurchase it I feel like
it's a really big deal it's just a
really nice smoothing primer a lot of
people would compare it to the Make Up
For Ever smoothing primer and I haven't
agreed I have that one too both really
nice but I definitely prefer this Tarte
one so y'all really excited that I have
another one so this is a great primer a
couple more items that were gifted to me
if you watch my latest haul I mentioned
a few amazing birthday gifts that I got
from my friends and social media family
and these were all sent to me from Lisa
which I'm super excited about is the
smooth operator Amazonian clay finishing
powder so this is what it looks like and
I am really excited to try this because
I'm a big fan of powders and I'm
collecting more and more so I'm excited
to try the Tarte one another thing that
she sent along is the spellbound
sprinkle face and body glitter this is
from the new make believe in yourself'
collection this is what the packaging
looks like it says it's a face and body
glitter I bet you would even be able to
like spray a brush with like fix+ or any
sort of like setting spray and then use
it as a highlight as well but that would
be really pretty so I'm excited to try
this and another thing that got me so
super excited she got me the contour
palette the volume - I am such a huge
fan of contour and bronzing and all that
good stuff and oh my gosh it's so
beautiful this is my first one I don't
have any of these like this from Tarte
it is beautiful I cannot wait to Charlie
so there's a blush a highlight there's
bronzers matte bronzer shimmer bronzers
there's a big ol mirror like this just
looks so gorgeous I cannot wait to be
using it I feel like we are going to be
we are going to be good friends so that
is the TARDIS contour palette volume 2
and then just my last few items are
going to be all eyes shadow palettes so
this one is the tartlet in bloom I got
this because everybody continued to rave
about it even after it wasn't a new
release you know sometimes when new
releases come out everybody's hyping it
up and all excited about it and then the
hype come to dies down but even after
the hype of this palette people were
still talking about it so often so I
finally just went ahead and got me it's
really beautiful
it's a really nice I shadow palette
especially for me who I really tend to
gravitate towards neutrals and browns
like it is just perfect for me
so the toilet and bloom palette really
really nice I shadow palette the other
one that I have and if you are not new
to my channel like I feel like I have
talked this palette to death this is the
style by Hruska palette it was in
collaboration with makeup artist Hiroshi
I love this palette I did this fell
everywhere with me
I think it's amazing I've put it in so
many videos favorites videos I don't
regret buying videos I mean just this
palette is one of my absolute favorites
not just up for my tart palettes but in
general I don't know if you'd be able to
see on camera all the dents and the
eyeshadows but I have put major dents on
them especially BAM pinch and smitten
are the ones that have like extreme
dents in them the blush is so beautiful
- it's so nice for traveling because you
have your mats like I could create I
took this Colorado with me and it was
like every single day I've just come in
here and put the mats on my eyes and I'd
be great but if we went out at night and
I wanted just a little pop of something
there's these really beautiful shimmers
and there as well there's the nice blush
there's a mirror it's small and compact
like I just I love this palette I think
it's still available you can get it at
Ulta and I'm always recommending it and
then the last item I have so excited
about this one - you probably saw it in
my haul video if you've seen that video
because this is from my beautiful friend
Lisa she also sent along the make
believe in yourself I and cheek palette
everybody's been going crazy over this
palette I'm so excited to have it
because it is just absolutely beautiful
it gives me like mermaid vibes I'm so
excited I think this is the one that I'm
going to use in my like full face using
new makeup and force impression video
coming up so I haven't used it yet
because I'm waiting for that video which
I'm super excited to film because I
absolutely cannot wait but most people
have been saying that they want to see
this palette in it because everyone is
so curious about this palette and
excited about this palette and it looks
absolutely stunning the only thing that
I worry about is that there's only one
matte shade and the other ones are all
these beautiful shimmers but hopefully
we can still make it work but I'm
excited those blues those greens like
just
beautiful mermaid unicorn vibes and I
absolutely love it so grateful to be
able to have this palette and to be able
to create an upcoming look so super
super happy that this was gifted to me I
had it in my loves list for the vib sale
and also plan on purchasing it in the
Tarte friends-and-family sale when that
came up and then I got this before I
made my order so I'm so grateful but
