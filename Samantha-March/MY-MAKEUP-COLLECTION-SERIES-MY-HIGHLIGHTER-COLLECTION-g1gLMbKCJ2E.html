today's video I'm going to be going
through my highlighter collection so
here is a little overview of what it
looks like I recently decided to start a
my makeup collection series I started
off with Foundation and I asked you guys
what you wanted to see next and the
overwhelming majority vote was
highlighters so why don't we happen to
it
this was the first Anastacio Beverly
Hills glow kit that I purchased it is in
that glow so these are $40 and they come
with four very large highlighting shades
so this one has sunburst golden bronze
bubbly and dripping and gold I probably
use bubbly and dripping and gulp the
most sunburst I really like as an inner
corner highlight golden bronze I will
use sometimes that's a highlight but
I've also used it as an eye shadow and I
thought it was really pretty I really
enjoyed these Anastasio Beverly Hills
glow kits you'll see another one coming
up here soon that glow I think is really
good for like normal highlighting shades
and you'll see what I mean when I show
the other one but I find these very
flattering and I think $40 is actually a
pretty good deal with the size of the
highlighters that you get so the next
one I have is a little sample from Becca
cosmetics and it is in opal
unfortunately it is shattered but let me
be very careful when it opened it up
opal is a super super pretty color it's
kind of similar to champagne pop have
like the peach of champagne in it I got
a little samples I think it was like a
free gift with purchase or something
like that from Sephora really glad I
have the sample I'm really sad that it
busted I mean a busted like when I
opened up my package it was already
broken which was a bummer but that's
what heaven with highlights but I do
love opal also from Becca cosmetics this
is champagne pops so this is in the
collaboration with youtuber Jaclyn hill
I absolutely love champagne pop but you
guys are gonna be so sad yep for this
one's broken to like it didn't come
broken and I had some good moments with
it before it broke but it then shattered
which is such a bummer Becca highlights
just seem to break so easily but
champagne pop is
stunning color champagne peachy type of
highlight it's absolutely gorgeous I
definitely suggest the song for
everybody this next one is mary-lou
manizer from the balm cosmetics this is
the first high-end highlighter that I
ever purchased so mary lou manizer will
always hold a special place in my heart
but it's a really pretty more like icy
vanilla type of highlight I think it's
really really gorgeous is another one
that I just think is really pretty and I
gravitate towards it quite frequently
gage cosmetics and Carli bybel palette
because it does include for highlight
shades so these shades at the bottom are
all considered highlighters this pink
one I think is really pretty for the
nose Carli actually was like obsessed
with this as a nose highlight and I
tried it out and really liked it
this one I've used on the cheeks quite a
bit these two I don't really use those
highlights because they're a little bit
too dark for me but I have used them and
the eyes this is one of like my favorite
palettes haven't seen it yet I do have a
really huge fall giveaway going on right
now and this is included in there so if
you want to win this I would say check
out that video but really I think I
think this is a really good palette
anyways another palette I have to show
us from Becca cosmetics and Jaclyn hill
obviously you can see I really love what
they come out with is such a gorgeous
palette so these are three blush shades
on top within here we have to highlight
shades so this is a champagne pop which
you know I was kind of like should I get
this palette I already have champagne
pop like yeah it's broken but honestly
the flush dates are super pretty and I
really wanted to try this Prosecco pop
it was the new highlight that jacqueline
collab with becca cosmetics with and
it's absolutely gorgeous it is a very
like true gold highlight and I just
think it is so stunning so I was really
happy I picked this up this was limited
edition I don't believe that you can get
it any more but Jaclyn and bucket came
out with split pans so one side has a
blush and one side has either champagne
pop or Prosecco pop and I believe those
are still available so I can try to link
those down below I definitely suggest
getting them the blushes in this palette
I think are fabulous but Prosecco pop is
such a gorgeous highlight and so a
champagne pop of course this isn't my
newest highlighting palette this is from
a pure cosmetics and it is
they're sunkissed glow palette so when
you open it up you do get a mirror but
then you have a three cream highlight
shades which I thought was really pretty
so this one is more like the vanilla
highlight and this one is like a pinky
highlight and then this one is like your
kind of deeper bronze highlight this
pink one in the middle especially is a
big favorite of mine I use this very
frequently but I like this one too I
like to apply these actually with a damp
Beauty Blender I think it kind of brings
it out a little bit more because these
aren't like super metallic like the
champagne pop or the Prosecco pop or
even like the highlights in the Carli
pella they're kind of more natural but
somedays you kind of want a more natural
highlight so I think it's good for that
I've come to learn that if I use a damp
Beauty Blender to apply them that kind
of brings them out a little bit more but
really nice palette I really don't use
this shade a whole lot but these first
two I think would look really nice on me
this highlight from Marc Jacobs and it
is called spot light so it is the glow
stick I actually received this from
Influenster and I was really excited for
it because this is not a cheap highlight
so this is what it looks like and it is
an absolutely beautiful highlight it has
silver in it and has gold in it it's
really unique I think and it was
designed to look good on every single
skin tone it's why it has the silver and
the gold in it I just think it's really
unique I like that it's a cream
highlight because cream highlights on me
tend to not show texture as much as with
a powder highlight because I do struggle
with texture like on my cheekbones sort
of thing and I really like that this one
doesn't do that like I said it is a
little bit more pricey but it is very
like even though this is a cream one
compared to the Pierre palette like you
are gonna see this this is gonna show up
on you and it's gonna look beautiful
except I have this Maybelline master
highlight it says it's a highlighting
bronzer I don't really see how it's a
bronzer at all it's more of just a
highlight in my opinion honestly I
really just keep this around in case I
need to use it for reference or have any
sort of like drugstore affordable
tutorial this is typically what I will
use but
I wouldn't recommend it it doesn't
really show up at all it's very like
kind of like powdery and chalky it's
definitely not my favorite but when I
keep on hand in case I need an
affordable option and the same thing
goes for this as well this is the Revlon
Photoready skin light it's a face
illuminator in pink light so this is
like a liquid highlight and I just when
I am going to do something more
affordable what I typically will do is
put a few drops of this and tap it onto
my cheekbones and then I will put the
Maybelline powder on top of it because
separately I don't think you really get
anything from these two products but
together it kind of helps it a little
bit more but not something I'd really
recommend and I keep it around in case I
need it for affordable looks finished
this is a palette from Smashbox it is a
blush and highlight palette and so
inside you have two blushes and then
this is a highlight these are their la
lights palettes and I really like them
not only are the blushes like super
super pigmented I just showed one ever
this one I believe it was in my full
face first impression Trellick trying
new makeup tutorial the blushes are
super super pigmented but the highlights
were really nice too and not only to use
as a highlight on your face but I've
also used them on my eyes as well and I
thought they worked really well so I
would highly suggest these Smashbox
palettes I don't think they've got
enough attention but I think they are
really good and then the last item I
have is another gold kit from Anastasia
Beverly Hills this is in the sweets
palette now I'm gonna open this up and
you guys are gonna think this looks very
strange and I will tell you why so here
is what my sweets palates look like so
the sweets palette came completely
shattered and I was really upset about
it and anastacio they tried sending me a
few other palettes all of them are
coming broken other people's were coming
broken as well I'm not sure what it is
with the sweets palettes and how they're
formulated but they just can't seem to
stay together so everyone recommended
that I tried the rubbing alcohol
technique and I don't know I did you
know this is what they came out like I
don't know people said when you use the
rubbing alcohol technique that they look
the same
I don't believe that for a second I mean
these look completely different
especially this one I don't know why it
looks so strange the pigmentation seems
the same to me because I did try these
when they were broken and I have tried
them after using the rubbing alcohol and
they look the same on me they just look
very different in the pans so that's why
it looks so different but I got this
palette because I think it is a super
unique palette and honestly I love sassy
grape it's this purple right here I use
it all the time
I have several pictures and tutorials on
Instagram using sassy grape and I just
absolutely love it
marshmallow I've used as an inner corner
highlight and I've also used it to like
highlight the nose butterscotch I think
is a beautiful highlight taffy is the
only one that I don't really gravitate
towards I've done it once before I did
the rubbing alcohol and once after and I
think the shade has stayed the same it
just is a little bit too deep for my
skin tone so it doesn't really look
great on me but the other three I do
really love especially saucy grape like
it's just kind of my everything I did
not think I would fall in love with a
purple highlighter but I definitely did
but this glow kid you know to compare it
with the back glow that I have do that
glow is a much more wearable one this
one is kind of more of a fun highlight
palette but as you can see from my
highlight collection I don't really have
a whole lot of like the fun highlights
so that's why I decided to get the Sun
and I am happy with my purchase I just
wish they didn't come broken it's all
right thing for my highlight collection
here it is once again I really hope that
you guys enjoyed this video and kind of
going through my makeup collection
