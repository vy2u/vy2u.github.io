today's video is going to be a another
part of my makeup collection series I'm
gonna be going through my single
eyeshadows which is what you see here
and then also my eye shadow palettes so
I'm going to start first with these
single eyeshadows but to start off I
have these two from L'Oreal they're both
the infallible eyeshadows one is in eye
/a which is this like shimmery type
vanilla champagne one and then the other
one is in liquid diamond it's a really
cool like blue-gray purple eye shadow
these were some of the first eyeshadows
that I ever purchased and I used the
heck out of them before I really started
buying like a lot of different
eyeshadows but every once in a while I
will dip back into these and I think
they are really really good eyeshadows
like I hear really good things about the
L'Oreal infallible shadows so would
definitely recommend these and these are
two of my favorite colors is from
Maybelline it's one of their color
tattoo 24-hour shades and the color is
in leather so it's really interesting
because it's more of like a cream type
of eyeshadow and this one is a really
nice purple color
I've used this alone before my eyes like
just literally put this all over my
eyelid or I've also used it as a base as
well I don't use it as much anymore but
this was like my go-to when I want it
like a super simple easy quick look I
would just put this all over the lid and
put mascara on and I was ready to go
another one from Maybelline another of
the color tattoos this is one of their
pure pigments this is in the shade
fairly brazen so this is what it looks
like when you open it up so the pigment
pigments are known for being messy but
honestly I hated this it does not show
up at all I even tried using it with
like mac fix+ and that sort of thing it
just does not show up at all I mean you
don't even get an hour of we're much
less 24 hours of wear so this one I
really can just get rid of from my
collection because I never touch it this
little guy is a shadow from Nomad
cosmetics I got it in
of my Ipsy bags so it just looks like
this it's just a nice like golden
shimmery color it's nice it reminds me a
lot of a makeup geek eyeshadow that I'll
show you guys a little bit later so I
tend to grab my makeup geek one more but
this was still a really nice shade just
something that I don't reach for a ton I
have to I shadow from Milani I have the
shades Bella espresso and then also
Bella ivory these are both in a satin
matte finish these were the first time
that I was trying the Milani
eyeshadows with these and I actually
ended up really really liking them they
go on really smoothly they are pretty
pigmented like I wouldn't say they're
the most pigmented eyeshadows that I own
of course but they do have nice pigment
they are from the drugstore so they are
more affordable I also have this pigment
this is from mac cosmetics it's in
vanilla I think I featured this in my
YouTube made me buy it video because
Carli bybel used to use it all the time
across the lid it was always a vanilla
Mac pigment vanilla Mac pigment I was
like okay I gotta go get it I mean I've
used it pretty frequently and I feel
like pigments are something that you
will just never use up like I mean I
have used this probably 20-plus times
and it looks like I haven't used any so
like pigments are pretty awesome for
that reason like you don't have to spend
too much money to get a product that
will probably last you the rest of your
life but I do find myself reaching for
this quite a bit these two glitters from
wet and wild are one is in spiked and
then the more gold one is in brass so
these I thought were very very
interesting they were only like $0.99
and everyone went kind of crazy when
wet-and-wild came out with them and one
of them works so well I think it's the
silver one works so well looks nice on
the lid shows up stays put and then the
gold one for me was so oily barely
showed up on the lids like I just could
not work with the gold one and I just
thought that was really interesting that
I bought the exact same product at the
exact same store I bought them at the
same time and they were so completely
different for that reason I don't really
reach for these a lot even though the
silver one worked out just fine it's
still kind of like
turns me off from these they were only
$0.99 and if I ever need something with
glitter I guess I can turn to the silver
one but I just thought it was very
strange how different the same product
could be see this little circle here
this is all of my color pop eyeshadows I
know I don't have a ton especially
compared to some other people but they
are only five dollars so they're
definitely not a bad price
this first one right here is called Lala
it's definitely a really pretty rose
gold color I actually just used this in
a recent Instagram tutorial that I can
leave link down below so that's
definitely one of my favorites next one
is plaid plaid was one that I really
liked too and if you can tell I did hit
pan on it so obviously that means I
liked it quite a bit it's just a really
nice deep green color so this was
another one that I really liked I will
try to link all of these down below like
I'll link all the products but
colour-pop is definitely challenging
because so much of what they put out is
limited edition and you know goes away
very frequently but anything that I can
find from colour-pop I'll link down
below but that's really why I don't
purchase more eyeshadows from colour-pop
or really much in general from
colour-pop anymore it's because it's
constantly limited-edition they're
always getting rid of things and it's
really annoying so this next one is
mixed tape and mixed tape was a really
interesting color it was like a I don't
know how to describe it so we're gonna
swatch it it's kind of like a mauve
shade but it has like a metallic shift
to it as well
it's just a really interesting color and
I find myself using it a lot especially
all over the lid I'm kind of surprised I
haven't hit pan on this one yet because
I do use it quite frequently but mixed
tape is another good one is millionaire
this is like a really really popular one
for color pop it wasn't one of my
favorites I can swatch this one too it
wasn't one of my favorites because I
didn't feel like it showed up on the lid
very well it just was more like straight
glitter on the lid so it has like a kind
of like a brown greenish base and then
has like gold glitter in it but when I
use it on my lid it just came out more
glitter on my lid and I just I don't
know I didn't really love it I probably
need to play around with it some more
but I don't know Nell you know like gets
so much hype on colour-pop but for me
just it ended up not being a favorite
have as puppy-love I know for sure this
one is discontinued it was a really nice
just like I hit pan on this one too it's
kind of like a metallic vanilla
champagne shade it was really pretty and
like all the proceeds went to I think it
was the no kill shelter in LA so I
wanted to buy it for that reason but
they discontinued it pretty quickly
which was disappointing but I use it for
a highlight quite a bit even more than
an eyeshadow but it's discontinued you
can't get it the next one I have is so
quiche this one I thought was such a
cool color this is what it looks like in
there and then I'll swatch this one too
because I'm like I don't even know how I
would describe this one either
so that is what Sookie CH looks like
it's another one that has like some
glitter to it but I found that it wasn't
just as like straight glittery as
millionaire was it's just such a like
cool cool color I love using this all
over my lid I just think it's such a fun
color and the glitter wasn't too
overwhelming so again that one was so
peach hopefully this one is still in
stock but I don't know for sure if it is
another one I have a Central Perk I will
admit I bought this mostly for the name
because I love friends it's just a
really nice like burgundy color which is
really good for fall right now I think
this one is still in stock I think this
is one that they kind of keep around
just a really nice like deep burgundy
shade no glitter no metallic no ships no
anything like that just a straight
burgundy color and its really really
nice the last one I have here is truth
with Lala quite a bit so in that
Instagram tutorial that I was talking
about with Lala this is what I use like
in the crease it's
just a soft tan beige color it's nice
for a transition shade like it's not
brown so it's not like the best crease
color in the world but for some reason
truth and Lala pair together is like one
of my favorite combinations so I like
truth I don't think it's one that like
you have to have in your collection but
I do think it's really nice so any of
the color pop shadows I'll try to leave
link down below and if you see me trying
to like close them really tight or I'm
struggling to open them it's color pop
shadows can dry out really quickly so
you want to make sure you close them
super super tight so they don't dry out
this probably should have been included
with my palettes since it's an eyeshadow
palette but for some reason I put it in
the side so this is from Wet n Wild it's
their silent treatment collection and I
think this is really nice for a smokey
eye you have your three different colors
here this color is probably my favorite
I actually use it on its own quite a bit
like I'll pull up this palette just for
this color so I think that's really nice
but when you pair them together you can
create a really awesome smoky eye I
actually use this for one of my very
first youtube tutorials that was just so
much fun to think about but these are so
inexpensive and the one wild trios are
seriously really really good so next
we're gonna move on to the palettes so
here's a quick overview of my eye shadow
palettes now at a time that like some
other people have but I've said in
several of my videos that I'm not a huge
eyes shadow palette junkie but this is
what I have so I will walk you through
each one but this is a two-faced palette
it's called pixie pinups so when you
open it up and have different eyeshadows
and it also came with an eye liner and I
think these were brushes maybe no I
think as a mascara and a brush I believe
if you can tell like I really really
loved that color but I actually used to
work with Too Faced in the past when
they first came out I did a lot of work
for them like on my blog and reviewing
for them and they actually sent me this
as a thank-you which was like super cool
and yeah I really used the crap out of
it I don't use it as much anymore mostly
because this palette isn't around
anymore and I don't even think the
shades are so it's not something that I
feel like I can use a whole lot but I
was so so grateful together them too
then this one right here is the Too
Faced natural eye palette that is the
very first high-end eyeshadow palette
that I ever bought I believe this is
still out but the packaging is a little
bit different this is this is very old
I've had this for several several years
and if you can tell obviously it's been
very very loved on but this is kind of
what brought me into the Too Faced craze
and yes still a brand that I support and
I purchased from very frequently so no
right here is eye palette from Smashbox
cosmetics if you can see that it's there
shapematters eyes shadow palette so when
you open it up it has the big mirror
right there and then these are all of
the different eyeshadows it also does
come with a double-ended brush so these
eyeshadows they're supposed to be able
to be used as eyeshadows eyebrow shadows
and then also eyeliners and I really get
a lot of use out of this palette I've
used it several times I believe I've
mentioned it in a favorites video I've
done tutorials with it I just when I
first opened this palette I was like
okay you know a lot of Browns and a lot
of neutrals like sure I can probably
create some looks with it but you know
probably not a ton and that is actually
so wrong I have created so many
different looks with this and I ended up
really really falling in love with this
palette I used the brush pretty
frequently as well especially this liner
side I will use like this black or this
deep kind of like reddish brown color or
even some of these Browns over here I'll
use them as liners I just I really like
this palette I believe it's still in
stock and not a limited edition palette
so I'll leave it link down below but
this one from Smashbox really impressed
me and actually Smashbox sent this to me
to review which I was so incredibly
grateful for and especially because I
just truly fell in love with it made me
so happy the next one is from Kat Von D
it's the shade + light eye palette this
was another one has a big mirror here
has this was another one that I featured
in my YouTube made me buy it video
because everybody was talking about this
and also the Kat Von D contour palette I
don't have that but I did buy the
eyeshadow palette and man am I happy
that I did this one is such a good
palette very hyped still I think to this
day and definitely worth the hype
most kind of remind me of each other but
they each feature you know different
colors different shades you just can do
different looks with them so even though
those are both matte palettes I still
think that they're different enough that
I'm glad that I have both of them this
is one when I first got it I basically
used nothing else like this was my
everything I traveled with this I loved
the big mirror on it it's so helpful I
love the shades they blend so easily
they're very pigmented which means that
they do you know kind of have a lot of
kick up to them but I mean the
pigmentation is worth it I just
definitely recommend if you're using
this on your eyes do your eyes first and
then your face makeup because you'll
probably get some shadows you know
falling onto your face but seriously it
really is worth it to me so this is one
of my two more few palettes this one is
the 35 T palette this is the first
palette that I purchased from morphe of
their like 35 eyeshadow palettes this
palette is freaking phenomenal it's full
of like moths
it's got great matte and shimmer shades
it's got gold it's got rose gold this
one is a really pretty like duochrome
it has the transition shades like the
nice Browns over here that I use almost
every single time I use this palette
it's got the deeper colors it's got like
the sparkly berries I love this palette
if you can't tell like it is dirty
because I use it so often and you can
create so many looks with this these
morphe 35o palette are super affordable
for all the shapes that you're getting
and I just really really enjoyed them
this next one I think this might be my
newest eyeshadow palette it is the
tartlet in bloom from Tarte cosmetics so
again it does have the mirror here and
then you have your eyeshadows there are
mattes there are shimmers there's you
know our transition color there's these
darker colors over here got these really
nice pretty shimmers this is an older
palette but still everybody talks about
this palette to this day and I was like
okay everyone is still saying you know
this palette is actually really
phenomenal I have to get it
I've only probably used it three times
since I said it is pretty new but it is
such a nice palette very very pigmented
and I've already done a several
different looks with it like each of the
three looks that
done have been very different looks I
think this is a really good palette I'm
really excited to keep playing with it
more and more another palette from Tarte
is a collaboration so it's the styled by
Haru SH palette her Uche is a celebrity
makeup artist so this is the club that
they did so it has the mirror here it
has six eyeshadow shades and then also a
blush shade I'm so so glad that I got it
because I love it I featured this in
favorites videos I use it all the time
this is kind of fun like my go-to when I
travel now because it has the mirror it
has a shadows it has a blush like it's
just it's very small and compact so when
you travel it is so good for that since
it is a club it will be a limited
edition but I believe it is still out
there so if it is I will leave it link
down below and I highly recommend this
one so this is my other morphe eyeshadow
palette and this one is the beloved 3
500 man everybody was talking about the
3 500 and it was so so hard to get my
hands on it was constantly sold out and
I finally finally got it and I'm like
you know what I I get why people love it
it is a gorgeous gorgeous palette it has
these really pretty lighter shades over
here obviously these are like your
deeper shades and your oranges then you
have the dark shades over here the
shimmer colors are absolutely beautiful
but these oranges I love there's almost
like like this is one of my favorite
ones it's almost like that like baby
puke color but I don't care I love it I
use it all the time I mean this palette
is so incredibly hyped up I don't feel
like I need to tell you guys how hyped
up it is because you probably know but
if you can get it I say get it because
the 3 500 is bum I have is from BH
Cosmetics and Carli bybel it has a
mirror as well and then it has a shadows
here and then also highlights down here
I've honestly abused the highlights as
eyeshadows as well but it's just a
really nice palette I find myself
reaching for it so often it was one of
those palettes again that I was like
yeah I could do like 2 or 3 looks with
it but honestly I use this so often and
for so many different types of looks
it was super affordable as well I think
I got mine for like $12 on VHS bub
I think it's now at Altos well for like
1450 so super affordable and one that I
really love next one is from two-faced
it is the sweet peach palette and oh man
you guys comes with the mirrors well and
then here are all the eyeshadows this
one was a super super hyped eyeshadow
palette and honestly the rig lease was
just a mess
like selling out within minutes
everybody was so upset like it took
forever to get my hands on it and
sometimes I'm like maybe I shouldn't
have gone throughout the struggle to get
it because it is so limited edition and
it was so it seemed to be in such like
limited quantities that barely anybody
got it so I feel bad when I use it but
honestly I actually really really love
this palette I have used it so many
times like usually days where I'm not
filming or not talking about my makeup
it's a one I will use this so I don't
upset people but I'm hearing rumors that
it's supposed to be coming back out
around the holiday season from Too Faced
I really really hope those rumors are
true because this is a gorgeous gorgeous
palette and I wish more people could
have gotten their hands on it cuz it's
stunning and it smells like peaches next
one is the mood struck addiction palette
and this is actually from unique I had a
friend that I know who sells unique send
this to me and I did a tutorial with it
so it has the mirror as well and then
here are the shadows I picked this
because I love Browns I love nudes and
have this really nice sparkly gold shade
in there as well if the shadows are okay
I wouldn't say they're like super super
pigmented like when I want to use the
shimmer shades I definitely have to use
like a mac fix+ but I think it was a
decent palette I little Anastacio
palette so it comes with four Anastacio
shadows in here
I got this off Ulta it was like five for
shadows and you got the little palette
holder for free which I really liked so
this is we have firkin burnt orange pink
champagne and henna I love these colors
I was really happy with the color
selection that I made Birkin is like an
everyday crease color so gorgeous burnt
orange like it doesn't look super orange
on camera but it definitely is orange a
lot of times if I'm in a rush I will
seriously just put burnt orange
everywhere all over my lid in
crease put mascara on and boom ready to
go I love it pink champagne
honestly pink champagne is so super
talked about from Anastasia and that's
why I got it I like it but I don't love
it I find that I have to use a lot of
fix+ and a lot of product for it to get
to for it to show up it's really pretty
once I can get it to there but you
really have to work with it but henna is
it like it's it's just like the scene
stealer so I can do like a swatch of it
so there is henna right there so there
is the swatch of henna right there as
you can see I mean it is just so
stunning one of my favorite colors I'm
really really glad that I picked that
one up it was kind of like my last
choice but I thought it just looks like
such a beautiful shimmer so those are
the four shadows I have from anastacio I
believe it but I almost forgot this
because it's always like it's not with
my other eyeshadows because I've been
using it all weekend so it's actually on
my desk but this is my makeup geek Z
palette so these are all of the single
shadows that I have from makeup geek so
we have Peach Smoothie creme brulee
glamorous bitten Coco bear shimma shimma
and this is env Peach Smoothie is like
everybody needs peach movies I mean just
everybody needs Peach Smoothie it's such
a pretty light shade like you can use it
as a base I mean you can use it as a
transition color I don't under thee just
so often creme brulee is another one
that I use almost every single day
because this is one that kind of reminds
me of Birkin from anastasiya it's just a
gorgeous like everyday crease color
glamorous this is the one that I said
reminded me of the Nomad cosmetics shade
it's just such a really pretty bronzy
gold color
it's just absolutely stunning Bittan is
the one that i used in my most recent
fall eyeshadow palette it's a gorgeous
gorgeous burgundy color and then Coco
bear is like it's another one that
everybody needs Coco bear I think it's a
really pretty deep Brown great for the
crease great for deepening up the
eyeshadow look it's just beautiful
shimma shimma is just a shimmery color
if you can
it just is so beautiful so shimma shimma
is right there is I don't feel like it's
swatching great on my hand
but it's absolutely gorgeous on the eyes
I use it so often and then Envy is such
a cool like green shade oh look at that
I absolutely love envy I don't use it a
ton because it's such a deep like
emerald green color but it is gorgeous
so makeup geek shadows they are really
really good I always say that I need to
get more makeup geek shadows I also
would need to get a bigger Z palette as
well of course but really good shadows I
mentioned some of my favorites in there
and I will leave all of these linked
