today's video is going to be part 1 in a
my makeup collection series so basically
I'm just going to be taking you guys
through my collection I'm going to be
breaking it down by different like
sections of my makeup collection the
reason that I'm doing this as I know
there's a lot of like makeup collection
videos out there where basically you're
seeing like the beauty room and the
setup and that sort of thing and then
just kind of like casually glancing at a
collection and seeing may be somewhat
like the more exciting products or
bigger name products or things like that
but the reason that I'm not going to do
it that way is because I don't have a
beauty room I do work from home and I
have a home office which is what I film
in not any sort of like beauty room this
is mostly filled with books and
notebooks files paperwork I mean is all
over my office it's a disaster every
single day and I just can't help it I am
in this office hours upon hours every
single day and it gets messy and
cluttered and my makeup just kind of
goes wherever I can have it like I have
makeup on my bookshelf I have makeup in
like a container over here I have makeup
on the desk behind me like thurs makeup
everywhere there's no rhyme or reason to
it really and in to do a makeup
collection video like that really
wouldn't make any sense like it just it
wouldn't make any sense and it would be
incredibly disorganized so I actually
asked my snapchat of course my sounding
board of what to do and we decided to do
the makeup collection series and I will
just take you through a bit by bit of my
makeup collection so you guys can still
see it and get my feedback on some of
the products and have a look at my
collection that way instead of a more
traditional way I have no idea if I will
ever be lucky enough to have a beauty
room I think those are so cool and such
a nice space to be in but as of this
time I do not have one so I would not be
able to walk you through a beauty room
and my office is just always in a state
of disarray and I don't think I would
ever even be able to clean it enough to
be able to film it because that's just
how I am I'll just be honest with you
but so to start it off I'm going to go
through my foundation collection so I'm
going to go through like foundation or
like powders and like I have BB creams
and things like that so that's kind of
going to be the first thing that I want
to do I might move on
like concealers and primers next you
know eyeshadow palettes eyeliners
mascara I can take you through my lash
collection and all that sort of thing
but if you guys do like this type of
video and you do want to see more of my
makeup collection be sure to give this a
thumbs up so that I dunno and also
whatever you want to see next please
leave that in the comments below or if
you see someone comment with something
that you really want to see next if you
like that comment and whichever comment
gets the most likes is what I can do
next if there's like an overwhelming
presence of a one part of my makeup
collection that you want to see next I
could definitely film that next for you
guys but I just thought I would start
off with foundation because why not so
yeah let's hop into it I'm excited to do
this series for you guys I've been
wanting to do a my makeup collection for
so long I was just so stuck on the fact
that I don't have a fancy beauty room so
how would I be able to do that for you
guys so I'm really excited I hope this
series idea works out but yeah if you
would like to see my foundation
collection please keep watching here is
my foundation collection so I have some
BB creams some like regular foundations
cushion foundations and some powders so
I'll just go through each one and kind
of talk about them in depth so let's get
started so this first one is actually a
tinted moisturizer it's from stila it's
our illuminating hint it moisturizer it
does have an SPF of 20 on it has this
for a while I really like it for days
where I really don't want like any sort
of like a full coverage or anything too
heavy on the skin so obviously it's
really good for summertime because it is
a moisturizer but it gives you a little
bit of as well to like even out skin
tone so I really like this one it was
pricey but I find myself using it quite
often especially in the summer next I do
have two different like BB creams these
are from all may it's their smart shade
smart balance so i have one in 201 and
300 the one in 200 i haven't opened yet
because i've been using the 300 more
because that's typically what i use in
the summertime because it's a little bit
darker but towards like the fall and
winter I would open up the 200 obviously
it's one I really love because I have it
in two different shades I remember when
I first bought it as a little freaked
out because it actually goes on the skin
white but then it does blend into your
skin really well so I thought they were
amazing for that but these are some of
my favorites and they are very
affordable next up I have two BB creams
and yes this one is a BB cream it just
got attacked by my dog and I was so sad
because I had actually just opened it
and my husband it was like well I could
probably put some tape over it and I was
like yes please do it and I'm still
using it with masking tape on it so
don't judge me but I do really really
love these these are the Maybelline
Dream fresh bb-8 and one beauty balm
skin Perfector 'he's i think they are so
good they're very similar to that all my
ones if i had to choose i don't know i
would maybe choose the Maybelline I
think they just feel a little bit better
on the skin but clearly I love two of
them because I have one and then I have
one as a backup as well for one I
finally run through the masking tape one
but I use them still often again
especially in the summer are like
traveling on vacations anywhere where
it's like really warm and you don't want
to wear full makeup the BB creams are a
very good option so this is a newer
foundation it's the l'oreal pro glow i
did just do a review video on this as
well where I've you reviewed a couple of
newer and beauty products this one
honestly when I first started using it I
was like I don't know like it's okay i
don't know if i love it though and i
found myself wearing it like everyday
and seriously as I'm holding it I'm like
um how much product is left in this
because it's been like my go-to recently
it does give a nice like healthy glow to
the skin I once it's like anything super
radiant or anything but a nice healthy
look to the skin it stays on so long
like seriously so long if you need a
good all nighter foundation this is one
for you but yeah I've really been loving
the new l'oreal pro glow but this one is
from maybelline it's the better skin
foundation and I'm sorry like all my
foundations look very used because they
are like I'm not someone who like can
make really pretty makeup because i use
it and how to use it well let me tell
you but i actually received this one in
an influenster voxbox and I was so
thrilled with it and clearly if you guys
can see like I truly do love this
foundation it's supposed to be
better for your skin because it has act
I'll see in it which is supposed to be
an ingredient for like keeping your skin
looking good I'm not totally sure about
that but I like find myself like when I
have breakouts or whatever I'm like I
better use the butter skin foundation
from Maybelline because it'll help me
but truly a very very good foundation it
is more on the mat side but definitely
one of my favorites this next one is
from l'oreal it's their true match super
blendable makeup now you might be
looking at this one and being like how
is that your foundation so this is a
foundation they have a very large color
range in this foundation but what I do
is I use this for any foundations that
might be too light for me I just use
like two to three drops in the
foundation that mix it together and then
I'm still getting the foundation that I
want but it's a better color match to me
I also will sometimes use this for like
cream contouring it's it's not the best
for me because it's a little bit on like
the two warm side for contour but it
works in a pinch so that's why I use
this I think this is really handy to
have for especially like for summertime
when some of my favorite foundations are
too light for me mix this into the
foundation and I still get the
foundation that i love but the color
matches right so i love it so this one
is a powder from maybelline and is there
fit me powder if you helped by the GAO
jeanette that I clearly do love it my
shade is in 310 and it's also from their
matte and poreless sign I really do like
the Maybelline matte and poreless sign
but this is what it looks like when you
open it up I just think it's a really
good powder a lot of times I will use
this as like a setting powder over my
foundation or especially if I use a BB
cream but I want a little bit more like
coverage to the skin I will use this as
well or even on days where I don't
really want to wear any makeup but I
want some sort of like even skin tone
action happening i will just use this
powder and i think it's fantastic so
maybelline fit me powder is definitely a
good one this is what the inside looks
like so the foundation is basically
soaked onto this cushion and i typically
take a Beauty Blender to apply it now
the only bad thing about this foundation
was well that it was expensive but it
doesn't have a whole lot of product
compared to other foundations so
actually a trick that I just learned and
if you have this foundation and you find
yourself running blow you can take the
cushion out and flip it over and
is more foundation on that other side I
just had to flip mine but I am going to
run out of this very soon which really
bums me out because it was like
seventeen dollars but seriously such a
pretty foundation especially if you want
a little bit of a glow another powder
that I have is from peer cosmetics and
it is therefore in one pressed mineral
makeup I have been using this for years
and years I truly have no idea what
number this particular one is maybe like
four or five but I use it so often it's
one of my favorite powders you can
probably tell by the like seeing the
inside of it that this is clearly very
loved as well but I just think it makes
the skin look so natural it doesn't make
the skin cakey at all and it's just
definitely a favorite of mine next is
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi I absolutely
love L'Oreal foundations there are some
of my favorites and if you guys can't
tell I'm a big drugstore foundation
junkie even though I think foundation is
important to me like I'd rather spend my
money on different higher-end things and
foundations from the drugstore I have
been completely happy with and this is
another one that is my absolute favorite
I've mentioned it in multiple favorites
videos it leaves the skin so
healthy-looking I think it definitely
gives you more of a glow even more than
the pro glow does I just think it is so
beautiful and also long wearing one of
my favorites it's really like a toss-up
between Maybelline and L'Oreal
foundations from the drugstore which I
like more because I truly love
maybelline's as well this one is from
their matte and poreless line I really
like this for when I am feeling a little
bit oily like especially in the
summertime like if you have oily skin
this is probably a great one to have in
your collection it is more full coverage
on me in my opinion a lot of times i
will apply it with a damp Beauty Blender
in order to not make it look so heavy on
my skin so it's not one that I reached
for super often but like when I need a
mattifying foundation going for this one
that leaves me very happy so also from
Maybelline these are their fit me
foundation these are like the regular
ones this is before the matte and
poreless came out and also the dewy ones
came out these were just like if the
regular fit meas I have two different
shades because one is just a little bit
of like a deeper tone pending
how can I am and that sort of thing
depends on which one i use i love these
a lot more than the matte and poreless
because I find them to be more
comfortable on the skin and a little bit
more long wearing as well and just a
little bit more natural looking for my
type of skin tone but these were like my
ride-or-die last year these were all I
war but they are still some of my
favorite foundations and then my last
foundation is from Clinique it's there
beyond perfecting foundation and
concealer i bought this during the last
Sephora vib sale and i ended up
absolutely loving it this has been my
go-to for the past couple of months now
I think it is so good when I need a more
mattifying foundation but something that
is still really really comfortable this
is what I am reaching for the
application is a little bit different
because this is actually the applicator
to put it on with but it makes it really
unique because you can swipe it on ask
foundation and you can also use it to
conceal any like redness or acne spots
that you might have it works as the
concealer as well so if you are looking
for a higher-end foundation this is one
that I definitely recommend it is also
very long lasting but also even though
it is considered high n it's only twenty
seven dollars which compared to other
high-end foundations which are more in
like the forty to fifty dollar range
that this one is more friendly for your
budget but yeah a big favorite of mine
alright guys so that is my foundation
collection I know it's not like super
huge for right now but again I am a
beginner and make up some of the very
first ones that I ever owned was the all
make and the Maybelline BB creams the
pure cosmetics powder and also the steel
a tinted moisturizer and then the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi those are some
of like the og's in my collection the
other ones are a little bit newer you
