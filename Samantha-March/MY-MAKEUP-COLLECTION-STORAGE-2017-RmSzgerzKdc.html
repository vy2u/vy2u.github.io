today's video is going to be my makeup
collection video I'm excited for this
video because it has been super
requested even like back when I first
started my channel the requests have
come in to do the makeup collection I
think these are just really popular
videos on on YouTube and people like to
see what other people's collections look
like how you store your makeup how you
you know set up your makeup how you
organize your makeup all that good stuff
and I've been pretty hesitant to make
this video so I relaunched my channel as
a beauty channel in May of 2016 so I
haven't quite been down here for a year
yet and I've always just been a little
bit hesitant to make this video so
that's why I wanted to come on here and
just talk to you guys first before we
actually jumped into the makeup because
a lot of people when they're showing
their makeup collection they're also
showing like their beauty room or
they're doing a beauty room tour I do
not have a beauty room what you are
seeing in my videos where I film at what
you seem in my snapchats
I am in my home office I do not do
YouTube full-time I don't do beautiful
time I'm a full time author that is what
I do I'm a published author for novels I
have one coming out very soon and I get
to do it full time I also do a lot in
the book industry such as like editing
proofreading and marketing things like
that that is what I do full time I do
consider YouTube and Instagram like jobs
of mine but they are not my full-time
jobs not my full-time career so I don't
have like a really fancy Beauty room
like you see a lot of other people have
even if it's not their full-time job but
they're still able to have Beauty rooms
I have my home office I love it I feel
so grateful everyday that I get to come
in here and work and it's just such a
special place to me so I love my home
office but it is also a disaster 99% of
the time because this is where I am all
day from morning until night I am in my
office it is lived in it is loved it is
messy is disorganized it is all of those
things but I moved my makeup down here
because like I said this is where I film
and it's just easier to have everything
here than it was being upstairs in my
bathroom and then my
election quickly outgrew my bathroom so
I brought everything down here but you
will see like I don't have any sort of
fancy setup or anything I started to get
a couple of nicer things here and there
like you know you'll see like my
spinning little towers back here that I
was gifted and and things like that but
I don't know I guess I just kind of feel
a little bit nervous you know my
collection obviously you'll probably see
a lot of makeup but I really don't think
I have a very large makeup collection
especially with some videos that you see
out there but it still will be a lot of
makeup I have bought a lot of it my own
I have recently been getting sent more
stuff which is nice but I also do like
to get products to review for my youtube
channel but I guess like what I'm most
insecure about and making this video is
just like showing how I'm organized
because it's really not that organized
and you know you'll see in the video but
I make do with what I can make do I'm
not gonna turn my home office into
solely a beauty room like that's just
not gonna happen and we don't have extra
space in our house for me to do that and
I really truly don't think I need it at
this point I think it's just fine and I
love being able to make my videos in
here as well this is my space this is
this is my space and I'm really proud of
it and I like filming in here I like
that I have my makeup and my books in
here and we have it all together so I'm
not gonna do an actual tour of my office
I don't know if I'll ever do one so I
did a real quick one once on snapchat
but I have a lot of like personal things
hanging up and then I just have stuff
everywhere just everywhere so this video
is gonna be solely focused on my actual
makeup collection but I hope that you
guys like it I hope that you like a very
real look at what it is that I look at
every single day and how I organize my
makeup and the drawers that I use and
what I utilize to try to be organized
but yeah that you guys like this video
maybe you find it helpful I'll leave
everything that I can at linked in the
description box down below for anything
organization wise that I have I'll I'll
try to find as many things as I can and
leave them link down below but thank you
guys for requesting this video I'm
excited for it I hope you guys like it
um yeah but that's gonna be also if you
would like to see my makeup collection
organization please keep watching okay
so starting over here I have just a
black desk and then on top I do have one
of these
spinner ones so this one I believe is
the one that was sent to me from life
wit store I believe it is I can leave it
linked down below I know that you can
find these on Amazon so I just thought
these were really handy these really
helped me out when it did come to
organization so these foundations down
here these are my three favorite two
foundations so I have them right here
L'Oreal True Match Lumi Clinique Loreal
Pro glow this is a Smashbox
blush and highlight trio and behind here
is the elf blush and bronzer palette I
have my favorite two concealer sticks in
here the Maybelline better skin the NYX
dual Tarte shape tape maybelline instant
age rewind Maybelline fit me my better
skin powder these are all of my
Maybelline fit me foundation my Milani
blushes and then just some more face
products here foundations and concealer
and then inside here I just have some
pallets
so those are my Anastacio pellets that
one is Smashbox we have the Anastasia
Modern Renaissance and the Kat Von D
shade + light so I just set those in
there and then on the top here these are
some makeup brushes and these are kind
of like my not as frequently used makeup
brushes so I put them here on the top
and then mostly on the top what this one
is focused on is lips so the new one
wild lipsticks I think these ones are my
two two lipsticks these are Max Factor
Smashbox and then I just have some
random things like this is the honest I
see a stick foundation but it seemed to
like work well there but yeah on top is
mostly just some lip products and then
some brushes another one right here but
first this is kind of like I don't know
if I would call it my everyday caddy or
like a lot of times what I put in here
is either things that I use frequently
or items that I need
to review that I'm still testing out
because I like to have them like in the
forefront because then I remember them
more but like the Becca and Jacqueline
palette I used that very frequently the
tartlet and bloom palette I use quite a
bit as well and then the style by
Hiroshi is one of my favorite palettes
these Sephora lip creams actually just
won these in a recent giveaway and I
need to try them out so that's why
they're in there with the color pop
hydroplane I've been testing that one
out my review just went up recently on
Instagram and I was in a January
favourites video I won this in the
giveaway package as well I've been
trying it out I was talking about this
brush on Instagram so I've been testing
that out I have these liquid lipsticks
from Christiana and cosmetics that I
need to do some swatches on some
colour-pop lippie is that I'm testing
out these are some I products and then
we have some peer stuff back here I just
got sent two of the foundations and also
their new foundation brush so I've been
testing these out and then the trolls
palette I was testing out as well then
like this is the appear hydrogel lift
but I use this like every day so I can't
keep it out here some more lippies that
I'm testing and then this is the Marc
Jacobs sugar sugar gloss which I use
very frequently as well so I leave it
out here testing this mascara as well so
that's kind of what this caddy is used
for and this was also sent to me from
the life--what store so I will leave
that link down below but I really like
it I thought it was pretty and it it
reminds me of what I need to be trying
out and testing and reviewing just kind
of in the back of the desk this is
really random but this is dec the pause
I took this out around Christmas time
and then I forgot to put it away but I
just thought it was cute this I just
have like for a little bit of decoration
I have like chokers and necklaces and
stuff inside here and then my Sephora
bag it used to be like you could kind of
see it in the background in my videos
but now these guys are in the way but
that's okay then I have another one of
the spinny towers my mom got me this one
for Christmas this is I think it's like
lori greiner and i think she got it on
QVC but if I can find it I'll leave it
linked down below this one is kind of
like the other one was like foundation
and face concealer lips and then this
one is like blush highlight
and eyes type of thing so these are just
two products from Sigma a gel eyeliner
and a blush these are some other blushes
when wild this is benefit dandelion and
a little guy of Elizabeth Matt's show me
your cheeks here we have some
highlighters mary lou manizer from the
balm becca champagne pop and then this
is a little sample of Becca opal
highlight these are my skin tone a via
makeup sprays this one is the primer
spray that I'm obsessed with and this
one is the finishing spray
have some more sprays over here the mac
fix+ pixie glow mist these are just some
Milani eyeshadows and then these are all
wet and wild trios and then down here I
have some more pallets that Urban Decay
Nicki smoke it they can they get a smoky
palette whoa the Too Faced Peach palette
this is a highlight palette from here
and then this is just a little guy of
makeup geek single shadows and then on
top is mostly like eyeliners lots like
these are all eyeliners I love eyeliners
don't mind me I love eyeliners this is
the Maybelline Color tattoo I have a
bunch of brow stuff here as well like
here's all like my benefit brows and
then inside a little bit I have like my
scissors typically I'll have my tweezers
over here but I did just put lashes on
and then I have like all my different
lash glue and then in here is still more
this is not an eyeliner okay so that
shouldn't be there don't mind that but
these are all like my color pop
eyeliners my Maybelline a liner so yeah
just a lot of like liners and lashes up
top there but that is the second spinner
guy that I have so I'll get all of these
linked down below and yeah I just think
they're really helpful but down here
we're about to get really fancy I have
this like little acrylic organizer I
have no idea where I got it I've had it
for years and years and years but in the
first drawer here we have these are my
color pop single eyeshadows this is the
bronzer champion from benefits and then
these are just like older eyeshadow
palettes that I don't use as much so I
just have them stored in this drawer
okay this drawer if I can let the
right in this is where I have all of my
lashes so like these guys are like all
the ardell lashes I have a lot of like
eye lower lashes these are my hooter
lashes and then these are just like
little like Tupperware things we have a
guest
my dog is now here these are just like
little Tupperware things again super
super fancy and all in here these are
just like products that I don't use
quite as much but I still use and like
don't want to get rid of so you feel
like my Maybelline brow drama on top the
L'Oreal infallible shadow is my Mac
vanilla pigment things like that and
then still kind of same thing in here
bronzers Revlon and some NYX stuff just
items that I don't use as much so I
don't need them out in the center but I
still like don't want to get rid of and
then just in this drawer I have like
makeup bags I typically always take this
when traveling like a smaller bags in
here and then this is a brush bag from
BH Cosmetics and when I travel I
typically always will take this bag it's
really hard to do one-handed it's pretty
dirty but this is where I put in all my
brushes so that is the bottom drawer so
this is a part of my desk I just have
some shelves in here again these are
just like simple mason jars I don't know
I mean pretty simple stuff but I have
two big guys and these have all of like
my colour-pop lippie stix ultra matte
lipsticks things like that in there and
then I have two smaller guys and in here
is like Chrissy and the and cosmetics I
have some Tarte cosmetics lippies in
here that sort of thing and then my
Mario Badescu spray because it it that
this always ends up in like a random
spot you never really know where you're
going to see this and then I just have
some other palettes in here that don't
fit in the spinors icarly Bible palette
I have two of the Anastasia
Glo kits and then I have two morphe
palette as well the three 500 and 350 so
I really like just I'm never really sure
where to put these so these are where
they go for right now but I use them a
lot so I don't like them to be away in
the drawer
I like more out here so that's where
those are so then on the desk there's
just this top drawer right here and then
inside this is where I have like a lot
of different primers or just powders
contour sticks my wet and wild stick and
then also back here where I have like
extras or like things I haven't opened
yet like some of these mascaras this is
a double of my Too Faced bronzer things
like that's a lot of like face powder
setting powders that sort of thing
primers that's what's in this drawer
it's just kind of like a random drawer
like things that wouldn't fit and then
over here is my bookshelf so this is
where I keep a lot of my brushes I have
my makeup brush set which has like some
oval brushes this is a real techniques
brush set it came with its own little
cup so I just have them start in there
because I'm not really like testing them
out or reviewing them anymore but I
still like that they came with their own
little cup it's just like a regular old
vase with some rocks in it and it has
the Sigma I think this is like their
detailed brush set again I'm not really
like reviewing or testing them anymore
but because there were so many brushes
and they came in their own set I gave
them their own little little space here
and then this guy is from the original
beauty store original beauty box my mom
got it for me for Christmas I did pick
it out I think it's original beauty box
I'll leave a link down below I did pick
it out it said that it was like marble
but I don't know like when I first
pulled it out I was like oh she just got
the white one but if you look close I
guess it it's marble but it's now this
marble as it looked in the photos on the
website that's for sure and then this is
where I store the rest of my makeup
brushes that I use on a more daily basis
this side it has like three different
sections in here this side is for like
my bigger face brushes the middle
section I do like my smaller face
brushes and then the third section I do
mark like my eye shadow brushes clearly
I need to clean my brushes let's get
serious and then in the next row I have
this spinner this was like the first
thing that I bought when I was trying to
like help with my makeup organization so
it just has these little compartments
here I got this off Amazon so in here I
have my mascaras pur Too Faced benefit
what's this one Max Factor and then I
have this guy to hold like my beauty
sponges and stuff so my dog doesn't get
them because she likes to eat them in
here is a bunch of like my Maybelline
lipstick Sigma lipsticks like regular
lipsticks the bottom section this is
where I have like this is a tinted
moisturizer and these are both more like
BB creams I got a little like trio from
Pier cosmetics of mascara so I put those
in there and then these are just some
face primers so that's what I have in
there and then over here I have a little
just like acrylic lipstick organizer I
got this off Amazon as well so here are
some lipsticks I got some NYX in here
these are like my very few lip liners
that I have live the next Laundry ray
Kat Von D this is a color jolt from
Maybelline a Lancome juicy shaker in the
back these are all Anastasia we have
some Kylie cosmetics right here but I
have more liquid lipsticks in here these
are like peer and then I think the
Giorgio Armani ones are in there too
lipsticks are definitely like what I
have the most of so I definitely need
some more space the third shelf I just
have a lot of my nail polishes and then
obviously you can see the ones that I
love the most because they don't even
make it into that canister they're just
right there okay guys so that is
basically everything for my makeup
collection I've never filmed this video
like that before so hopefully the camera
wasn't too shaky and no-one's like super
nauseous after watching that but I was
holding the camera the whole time so my
arms are exhausted but I hope you liked
getting a peek at my collection I kind
of went through you know some of what I
have but I do have a makeup collection
series I actually broke down each
section in my makeup like foundations
and lipsticks and mascaras and lashes
and things like that and I go through
each one separately and you know more in
depth so I'll leave that collection
listed down below as well but hopefully
you guys like this video please make
sure to give it a thumbs up if you did
