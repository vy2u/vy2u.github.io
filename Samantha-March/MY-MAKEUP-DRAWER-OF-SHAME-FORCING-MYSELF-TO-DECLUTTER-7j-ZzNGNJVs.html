today's video I am going to be sharing
what is in my makeup drawer of shame and
let me explain what that means I don't
know if anybody else is like me but I
have I have a drawer I have some acrylic
drawers that sit next to my desk and I
have certain makeup items in that at the
back of that drawer I put in items that
I know I don't want anymore
they didn't work for me but for some
reason I can't get myself to throw them
away I have this I'm a hoarder let me
say that I am a hoarder and I can admit
that but I have this weird thing where I
have certain products that I'm like I
might need that I mean I might need to
show that in a video I should probably
just hang on to this and I'm like
Samantha you need to admit that you have
a problem I need to force myself to do
some meta cluttering for today's video
it's kind of like reorganizing and
rearranging of my office over the
weekend and I happen to open up that
drawer and just seeing some of the items
that were back there just like triggered
something in me and I was like I need to
get rid of these so I started to pull
them out and then I was like I could
share this in a video I could share with
you what is in my makeup drawer of shame
I would love to know if anybody else has
a makeup drawer of shame what is in it
what are some items that you just can't
force yourself to get rid of I'm gonna
show you some of the items in there that
I pulled out and make myself get rid of
some of these because this is ridiculous
so if you want to see what is in my
makeup drawer of shame I'm gonna go
ahead and get started
hey so in here this makes zero sense to
me why I felt the need to hold on to
these because it's a pair of lashes like
lashes and they are past their prime I
wore them so much and it's not like you
can just like pop on lashes and I'd make
it work I just I don't know why I kept
these what is my problem but these are
from flutter lashes they were in
collaboration with makeup Shayla I think
I got him in like a beautycon box I
really enjoyed these lashes like I said
I warm like crazy I thought they were
really cool and like unique looking
lashes for me they weren't my regular
style why do I still have these I don't
need these when lashes are past their
prime their paths are prime and can't
use them anymore so those need to be
thrown
why I'm like embarrassed like I'm like
this video that's gonna be kind of
embarrassing also in here I have the
appear transformation palette so this is
a little pellet like this and you have
like a variety of different options into
here you have some eyeshadows in here a
blush and a bronzer it has a nice mirror
I've used this a couple of different
times and it wasn't anything that
necessarily like blew me away I didn't
love it I think I probably was keeping
this around because of like youtuber
reasons for to be able to like put it in
a video if I was talking about like best
and worst appear or something like that
I really don't even know but it's just
taking up a room I mean it's a smaller
palette but it's still taking up a room
in my drawer and it's just not necessary
for me to keep it because I don't reach
for this palette a ton so like Smitha
get rid of it you can pass it on to
someone else you can chill them up
somewhere else you don't have to keep
these you're so weird
next up I have a bonus as a bronzer
blush type thing this is from Hikari
it's called the radiation or bronzer so
it has a couple different shades in here
are all shimmery in here and I just is
something that I don't reach for I think
this came in like an Ipsy bag never
really gravitated towards it at all
why I kept this is completely beyond me
like beyond me no idea why I kept this
around this needs to be declutter I can
pass it on to someone else I have why
did I decide to do this video so when I
was going through the drawer I saw this
little guy from Becca and I was like why
do you still have this this is an opal
highlight it's like one of the many
highlights I think I got it as like a
free gift with purchase type of thing
from purchasing something from Becca or
something like that probably from the
Alta website but it is completely
shattered like I can't open it because
it's completely shattered I hate
repressing makeup it doesn't work for me
I don't have the patience for it I think
it looks bad every time I do it I just
repressing makeup is not for me and I
don't think I might even have opal in a
Becca palette so why why do I still have
this mini I don't know I have no idea
but this one this one needs to go as
well because it's just embarrassing I
know I'm never going to
press it I don't open it I won't use it
and I'm fairly sure I have a full-size
in a pallet so like get it together so
next time I found 2 makeup sponges in my
makeup drawer shame this first one here
is from ELF and I don't know if you
would be able to see it has like these
flecks of glitter all throughout it it's
like kind of a newer issue release from
elf but you're supposed to be able to
apply like foundation with it but it's
also called the highlighting sponge I
think it was called and you're supposed
to like apply light cream highlight and
stuff with it and I never really
understood of like the glitter supposed
to like come off on your skin as well I
just never really understood this sponge
and never loved it and so I put it in
the drawer like maybe I'll need it some
day I don't need it and then also I have
another one here from Pierre and this
was a horrible spot I think I got this
and I guess subscription bag as well or
something it's like super super hard and
when you pounce it on your face it's
like you're punching yourself the this
this was no good again why I decided to
keep it I don't know because I have
plenty of other makeup sponges that I
prefer to reach for I can't remember the
last time I reach for that Pierre 1 so
it's embarrassing we can just go ahead
and toss those I have a glitter here
from Wet n Wild this is called the color
icon brass glitter singles that's what
it's called this was like $0.99 and I'm
fairly sure it was even cheaper like 69
cents or something when I bought it at
Target but a bunch of people are talking
about these button Wild glitters like
last summer or something like that so I
went out and searched for them and I
found two I found a gold and a silver
and I think I put the gold in my makeup
drawer ashamed because I didn't like the
gold like the silver looked good but the
gold was like super super oily oily like
even when I put my finger in it it was
like an oil slick with some glitter to
it and when I tried to apply it to my
eyes like it looked weird I think I
mentioned this in a video where I was
talking about like products that didn't
work or you know something like that but
like I I know that I talked about this
in the video and said that it didn't
work for me and I talked about the
discrepancies between the gold and the
silver and how I wasn't happy with that
but like it was super cheap so cool but
then I've never reached for it again so
I'm just gonna go ahead and say goodbye
to that what about butter is there no
reason I'm holding on to it and
I found in there also this is from
Maybelline it's the brow precise of
fiber
volumizer so this is for your brows when
I was first learning to get into brows
and doing my brows I was mostly reaching
for items like this like the benefit
gimme brow where it's not necessarily a
brow pencil brow pomade anything like
that it's just like a fiber mascara type
for your brows and it just makes them a
little bit fuller and things like that
but this one this one it was okay the
one looks really crazy this is what it
looks like so what's different than the
Gimme brow which actually looks like a
mascara wand this one is like it's like
one half of a mascara wand it was kind
of easy to like fluff up your brows too
and it has a little bit of color to it
but it was not the easiest to use at the
same time and now I'm much more
comfortable using a brow pencil so I
don't know I decided to put this in my
makeup drawer of shame just in case I
like needed to pull it out at some point
or maybe do a comparison I really don't
know but I have not I didn't even
remember this was a part of my
collection at one point until I pulled
it out and I was like oh my gosh this is
my biro thing but you're doing a force
declutter we're doing it force the
clutter today come on girl okay so also
in here I have from ELF this is called
teal tease and it's like a cream
eyeshadow this is what it looks like and
you can see that I've used it I used to
use it as like an eyeliner kind of like
a blue gel liner but I don't really
reach for anything like that anymore and
I don't do a lot of like really colorful
eyeliners on top I prefer more on the
bottom so I use this a couple times I
think I reviewed it I think I put in
like a tutorial on Instagram and then I
was like yeah I'm probably never gonna
use that anymore but just in case I want
to I'm just gonna set it in this back
drawer and I'm gonna wait for that right
moment to pull it out it's probably been
a year since I've used this so I'm gonna
go ahead and move on and then I have a
foundation in here again this is from
appearance the bear at all it's the
12-hour four and one skin perfecting
foundation I really did not like this
foundation and I think again I've
mentioned this I know I mentioned this
in one of my videos maybe like PR
products that I wouldn't repurchase or
something like that or PR products I
wouldn't buy with my own money
this foundation just really did not work
out for me it's very thick on the skin
it's a very thick one that comes out
it's hard to just get out of the squeeze
tube in general it's just not a
foundation that I enjoy but again I keep
it around and I think it's that youtuber
thing then I'm keeping around for like
future videos but I know I've put them
in videos like that so that means I can
move on I can move on to the next thing
I don't need to keep products for three
years just to mention in a video that I
didn't like it so I'm gonna move on from
the Pure Barre Adele foundation that did
work for me this next item is so
embarrassing when I pulled it out I was
like no that's not going in the video
like I'm not gonna say that I did that
then I was like you know what girl you
you're already making this video like go
all in this is from all may this is the
smart shade Smart Balance
skin balancing makeup if you can see it
still has the plastic on it it has never
been opened the cap is covered with the
plastic I probably have had this in my
makeup collection I mean I'm going to
say five years and it's probably been
more than that this all my smart shade
Smart Balance was one of the first like
when I was like trying to get into
foundation but I wasn't really sure what
I was doing I was buying this I started
buying this when I worked I can remember
this specific clinic that I worked in at
the hospital and I have not worked for
the VA for five years so I'm already
telling myself that this is older than
five years it's brand-new it's never
been opened it's never been used and it
just I mean that means did I move houses
with this oh my gosh I probably did oh
my gosh this probably I probably have
this in when we lived in our condo and
then we bought a house this brand new
never been open foundation probably came
with me oh that is embarrassing what is
wrong with me
I don't know why I haven't used the all
my smart shades my balanced makeup in
years in years but this I I used to wear
this so much that a lot of times if they
were having like a buy one get one half
off
I would purchase like two at a time or
whatever because this was really like
the only thing that I was wearing it was
really crazy is that when you wouldn't
you squeeze it out on your fingers it's
actually white and I remember the first
time using it I was so excited and I
used to like do my makeup in the at the
VA when I would get there in the morning
cuz I'd get there so early and I
remember the first time putting it on my
fingers and I turned to one of the
nurses I was like why is this white like
how did I like mix up my shades so bad
and like somehow she knew exactly what
it was she's like no when you put it on
your skin it'll it'll match to your skin
and I was like oh my gosh makeup is so
cool oh that's really embarrassing I
also haven't hear from ardell this is
the stroke of brow feathering pen for
your brows I'm pretty sure I use this in
a first impression video and I did not
like it at all this is what it looks
like and this is not a brow product that
I'm good at it's like a very flimsy
applicator so to like get precise brow
going on is just not cool I've mentioned
in a video I've mentioned it in a
follow-up video that I don't like it
I can move on from it we know I also
have oh this is pretty embarrassing this
is from L'Oreal these are two of their
what are they called
they're called the infallible eyeshadows
I have a liquid diamond and also iced
latte I bought these I think before I
started a channel because I would always
see Carli bybel using these she usually
so often in tutorials and a lot of other
people like I was seeing them in other
YouTube videos people raving about these
infallible shadows so I remember going
to like my Walgreens or whatever and
being like I need to have these I need
to have these everybody's using them in
videos and I mean honestly I'm I'm sure
I got my money's worth out of these
because I use them so much a lot of
times I use these two as a combination
together but it's probably like I
probably have these in my collection for
three or four years or something like
that and I just very rarely reach a
first singles anymore so as my eyeshadow
collection was getting bigger and as I
was getting more palettes these were
kind of constantly just being pushed to
the side until they eventually ended up
in the makeup drawer shame so you know I
don't know if this would be good to pass
on to like a friend or I mean they're
pretty old I don't know what these would
expire but
I've had them for a very long time so
that was kind of funny to seeing kind of
like a blast from the past type of thing
I also have this is super random but it
was in my little my makeup Durov ashame
I have like a little basket back there
as well and that's what I was like
putting items in this is from Ella Rose
minerals it's the bright eyes under eye
brightener it's like a powder brightener
that you were supposed to like mix in
with the concealer to make your eyes
look brighter I didn't really notice
anything with it I'm pretty sure this
got sent to me in a PR package but I
didn't really notice anything with it
and it's just messy and I have other
under eye brightener that worked better
but for some reason I kept holding on to
it so I'm just gonna go ahead and say
goodbye to that because there's no
reason to keep holding on to it and I
didn't really love it and lastly this is
a bit embarrassing but I had so many
colour-pop but super shock shadows
shoved into that little basket in the
back of my drawer that I was like girl
why do this to yourself I have talked
about the color pop of super shock
shadows I don't love them I really love
their pressed eyeshadows but the super
shock I just really could never get into
and I felt like I was buying them
because everybody loved them so much
everybody was doing like huge collection
videos up their clutter pop single super
shock shadows that I was like yes I need
them too and so I was buying them out
I'm like I don't love them why am I
doing this to myself and so I finally
stopped but I still have so many that
were shoved into that drawer because I
just don't reach for them anymore so I
need to this this needs to stop this is
a sickness okay let's go through these
this one was plaid oh you always had to
close him so tight because otherwise
they would dry out
plaid was a pretty cool color it was a
really deep green I used this one quite
a bit I've hit pan on it but it's pretty
cool I have to color pop super shock
shadows in my 18 and 20 18 project pan
this one I have hit pan on but again
I've had these for years don't really
reach for them anymore there's no reason
I need to keep these around millionaire
was one of my favorites that is a really
cool color why do I not want to get rid
of this one why I haven't touched it in
so long
you can get rid of it Samantha me that
was millionaire that was a pretty cool
color I liked that one I also had puppy
love this is another
one that I hit pan on these are like
five dollars so again I feel like I've
got my money's worth on pretty much
everything
puppy love I used as an eye shadow I
used to have an inner corner I used as a
highlight I really did enjoy puppy love
to be honest and then I have so quiche I
think this was like a jaclyn hill
recommendation you can see it's kind of
similar to nilly they're pretty cool I
can see that there's a pretty big dent
in it no pan yet but again I don't touch
these I don't touch my Clara pop single
shadows I even have two in my project
pan and I still from the time that I
started my project pan in January from
when I did my update video last week I
used them one time and it's on my list
to hit pan on them that's ridiculous
this essential perk this was a like
kathleenlights
made me buy it it was a really cool
matte on like deep purple burgundy shade
but again with so many of these colors I
can dupe them in my palettes I you know
maybe I have them in the color pop press
to shadow version but like I know I have
Central Perk oh man this next one is
mixed tape I actually use mix tape a ton
I would just put this all over my lid
and call it a day I've hit pan on this
one as well so that's pretty cool but
yeah it was a really like funky kind of
like greyish purple shadow with a bit of
a sheen to it I did wear that one quite
a bit and then this next one here is
hydroplane this was a really cool shadow
it was blue it had some flux of like
silver in it this was a collaboration
with Amanda steel I did like this one
gave me some cool mermaid vibes but
again like I have this color in palettes
and so I just carry barely reach for the
single but when I was going through that
drawer I was like yeah I'm not surprised
to see these color pop shadows because I
felt like I had to keep them around you
know as part of like the youtuber type
of thing but then I was worried like
maybe someone would want to see a
tutorial using like color pop super
shock shadows I don't know what my
problem is but I feel like I got my
money's worth these are five dollars I
felt like you know I've hit pan on
several of them but I know I haven't
opened any of these in a very very long
time so I know that I can get rid of
them I know I can clear up space in that
makeup drawer of shame to just make way
for new items that for some reason I'm
not going to be able to depart with but
after those color
shadows that is everything that was in
my makeup chart shame and I'm gonna go
cry now okay so that is gonna be
everything for today's video it was a
video that I wasn't planning on doing
until this weekend when I was kind of
moving things around and I stumbled upon
that drawer it got really embarrassed
I'm not sure maybe other people have
done videos like this if you have or if
you've know someone who's had you can
totally leave it down below it just kind
of popped into my mind when I opened
that drawer and realized like how
embarrassing it was and then I really
needed to do a little something about
that but I hope that you guys enjoyed
this video let me know if you have a
makeup during what's in there what is
something that you're like you know what
I haven't used this in a really long
time it's time to say goodbye I would
love to know but yep I'm going to go
hide in shame now I hope that you guys
enjoyed seeing this video if you did
give it a thumbs up I hope that you'll
also consider subscribing before you go
and I'll catch you guys in tomorrow's
video right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
