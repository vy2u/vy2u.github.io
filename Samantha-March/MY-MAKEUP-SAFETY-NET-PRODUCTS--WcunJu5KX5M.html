today's video is going to be all about
to makeup products that are my safety
net these are my tried and true makeup
products these have achieved holy grail
status but even more than Holy Grail
status these are the items that I turn
to when I cannot be let down and I know
that they will not disappoint me so if
you are ready to see some of my absolute
favorite makeup products the ones that I
highly recommend and I'm always rooting
for myself why don't we go ahead and get
started
alrighty so jumping into it I did look
up the definition of the safety net on
merriam-webster just cuz I was curious
and that definition is something that
provides security against misfortune or
difficulty and I was like yes yes these
makeup products that I'm going to talk
about only do I reach for like if I'm in
a hurry or you know I travel with a lot
of these products but just those days
where I'm not feeling super creative I
don't have time to sit down and plan out
a makeup look and you know pull out all
these new products and try and you know
test out new things like I just want I
just want to be in my comfort zone I
have an item for every single category
some I have multiples in that category
but I really went through my collection
and pulled out those items that I feel
very strongly about that don't give me
difficulty or misfortune so jumping into
it I'm going to start off with the face
I have two different foundations to talk
about once drugstore and one is high-end
but both of these are the ones that I
continually reach for so the first one
from drugstore this is the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi foundation and I mean just
look at the foundation look how much has
been used look at this like dirty
disgusting cap because that's who I am I
mean there's barely any foundation left
but this has been one of my favorite
foundations for so long it's that one I
reach for when I just know I I need
healthy-looking luminous skin it's going
to give me a nice glow it's so easy to
apply it's long wearing it's just one of
my absolute favorite foundations it does
not do me wrong
and then the other one that I have
that's high-end this is the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation in
concealer my Shaitan is buttermilk and
this one and then my shade in the True
Match Lumi is sand beige in case you are
curious but the Clinique foundation I
have recommended this so many times over
one of my absolute favorite foundations
it's so long-lasting
it's more of a full-coverage foundation
and this was one of my like first ever
full coverage foundations that I
actually really got along with reach for
this foundation a lot for special
occasions like weddings I was a
bridesmaid in May this is the foundation
I wore I go to a lot of concerts I love
going to concerts and I went to one just
a couple weekends ago this is the one
that I pulled out because it just looks
so good on the skin it doesn't do me
wrong it lasts all night it can last
through you know heat humidity being
outside for several hours I mean I'm
just I love this foundation so these two
are absolute safety net foundations they
don't do me dirty mm-hmm the concealer
like I love concealers and I have a lot
of concealers I like to try a lot of
concealers but there is always one that
I am reaching for there's always one
that's going in my travel bag for sure
there's a lot of other ones that I
really like and there's a lot of other
concealers that I would say are my Holy
Grails but that one that I know is not
going to do me wrong is the Tarte shape
tape and I'm sorry I know the shape tape
gets so much hype into so much attention
but I'm one of those that absolutely
loves the shape tape and I'm actually
almost out of this like I swear I
probably only have like two to three
uses left I just need to buy a new one
already for sure I'm in the shade
light/medium in my shape tape but I love
how full coverage it is because this is
the one that like I especially love
taking it traveling for there's days
where I have to get up maybe a little
bit more earlier and my dark circles are
very prominent this is gonna cover
everything yet it still blends out so
well it looks so nice don't deal with
the creasing with this one that I can in
some other concealers and this is just
my go-to the Tarte shape tape has never
steered me wrong it's never done me
dirty it's just my favorite when I was
thinking about some other items like you
know bronzer and blush for my face I
have a few you know favorites I have a
few holy grails in that category
but the one that I continually find
myself reaching for is actually in a
palette this is the pure vanity palette
and this is in gold digger this palette
is really interesting to me because it
actually does have a couple of
eyeshadows over here but then it has a
bronzer of blush and a highlight and I
love all three of these in this palette
and this is the one that I
continually reach for I travel I'm
reaching for this I'm in a hurry I'm
reaching for this because of that
bronzer the blush and the highlight in
here they are all so beautiful is what
I'm going to have to give it to us my
safety net product because it's always
on hand else in same thing when I was
thinking about highlighters I mean I
have a deep obsession with highlights
and I really tried to think about it
what does that want that I know isn't
going to steer me wrong the one that's
been tried and true for me for so long
you know obviously one that has holy
girl status but what's even above the
Holy Grail what's my safety net and it
is a Becca cosmetics and rekelen health
now really I own a couple of single
Becca highlights as well I have a single
champagne pop I have opal and I
absolutely love those really this
palette is pretty freakin amazing now I
do use the blushes in here quite a bit
these two blushes over here which are
amaretto and Rose a spritz
I do use those blushes a lot but
especially these two highlights I reach
for these so much because I know they're
gonna look beautiful they're gonna make
my skin glowy they're not gonna show
texture they're just going to look good
with basically every makeup look that I
do and the highlights in here are
champagne pop and then Prosecco pop so
obviously this one is more champagne
this one is more of like a true gold so
it's like no matter what it is makeup
look wise that I'm doing I know that I
can come into this palette and pull out
one of these two highlighters and it's
gonna look phenomenal on my skin but the
highlighters are amazing I need to
really beef up my betta highlight part
of my collection because I don't feel
like I have enough of her highlights
because I'm continually so impressed
with them but this may be right here
this is my fall back this is my safety
net this is what I reach for when I need
a beautiful stunning highlight do have a
brow product and that I can mention here
which is pretty fun so definitely my
safety net brow product is the benefit
goof proof this was one of the very
first brow products that I really tried
and was also really able to get the hang
of I didn't quite understand how to do
my brows for a while when I'm in a rush
or I just I just want to not have to
overthink it because a lot of times when
I'm doing my brows because I'm still
well you know now I don't want to say
that I'm not good at doing them but I'm
not like super skilled yet I can't just
do them real quick and easy and without
thinking I really have to be focused as
I'm doing my brows because I feel like I
can kind of you know mess up pretty
easily and I'm not exactly sure how to
fix my mistakes yet when it comes to
brows so when I need something that I
just know isn't going to do me wrong
it's not gonna cause me misfortune or
difficulty that is the goof proof I
actually have it on today I did film
this look this is a full face trying new
drugstore makeup this video went live on
Friday as I was waiting for my camera to
cool down before I could continue
filming I needed to fill in my brows
really quick and I grabbed at the goof
proof-- because I was like you never
really know how first impressions are
gonna go some things aren't so great
like I at least need to have my safety
net brow product on hand and that is my
goof proof it has a spoolie on one done
which is fantastic this one is pretty
loved but it has more of a teardrop kind
of diamond shaped and I feel like it's
just really simple especially for a
beginner if you're trying to get into
brows you're trying to learn them
suggest picking up the goof proof
because as a beginner as I was learning
this was the pencil that I was using
that I was finally able to see progress
with but it's continually the one that I
fall back on so benefit we are going to
end the video with eyeshadows and then
lipsticks oh yes here we go cuz I got
several and you just category so some of
my absolute fall back i shadow czar some
of like my originals from when I first
started my youtube channel and purchase
even before I had a youtube channel
these are my makeup geek single shadows
this isn't even all of them this is just
the very first is the palette that I
bought when I purchased I think it was
like for makeup geek single shadows I
reach for this particular Z palette so
much shadows just they don't do me wrong
shadows like Peach Smoothie creme brulee
cocoa bear shimmer shimmer these are
like my OG shadows from makeup geek and
they are just they're my fallbacks
I know what to do I know what kind of
look to create I know how they blend
those four shades in particular that I
mentioned those are really the
once that they get me they understand me
they don't want to see me have a bad eye
shadow day you know one of my staples
one that comes with me basically to
anything that I'm going to is the
Anasazi Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance
palette this palette won't play me it
just refuses to it's really quite
incredible when you think about it this
palette just has you know a little bit
of everything in here for me in these
sheets I just love them so much and they
look wonderful and they blend easily and
the modern renaissance is just a
completely hyped up i Xiang palette for
a good reason there's not a lot of
people about this palette it doesn't
work for not saying it works for
everybody because that's never the case
but a lot of people really love this
palette I'm definitely one of those it's
definitely a safety net I shadow palette
for me and I just love it
so our palettes that are pretty and new
to me but they instantly got me this
first one is the Tarte clay play palette
I feel like I talked about this palette
quite a bit if you follow me I try to do
a share on my Instagram stories quite a
bit of like the makeup that I'm wearing
that day and you see the clay play a lot
because not only am i reaching into it
for the eyeshadows but I'm also reaching
in for it because these two shades right
here are beautiful for contour and
bronzer shades and I love this kind of
all-in-one palettes I just find them so
helpful I take this beauty traveling
with me so much it's really nice and
sturdy packaging it has that big mirror
and I love it love the eyeshadows so
much I reach for these shadows so much
they don't play me they are so pigmented
they are so easy to blend I love them
but also you know this one is just a
little bit of a step up because you also
do have some of these face shades in
here and I really appreciate that it
doesn't do me wrong tarqell a play then
the final an eyeshadow palette I'm not
talking about it's a newer palette but I
feel like if you've been watching some
of my videos you're not going to be
surprised with this it is the Jaclyn
hill and morphe palette this palette it
doesn't do me wrong there's a day
I'm not feeling super creative I'm just
maybe I'm in a funk but I really need to
do my makeup just something but I can't
think of anything I'm looking at
like I just don't know what to do I'm
gonna come into this one because not
only do I love the shadows they're very
pigmented they're very easy to blend I
love all of these beautiful mats in here
like there's a lot of days where if I'm
not feeling very creative I'm just going
into like these matte Browns because
that's my fallback that's my safety net
when it comes to actually like makeup
looks but also I'm gonna be having that
day where I'm like you know what I'm
just not feeling creative today and I
open this palette and Allison I'm like
I'm gonna play with the blues and the
greens and the purples and I get excited
again I just get pumped when I open this
palette and I'm like I am ready to do my
makeup actually what kind of mood was I
in before that's what this palette does
for me and I think that's a lot of fun
and then we were gonna end it with lip
products so these are not only formula
wise that are my safety net but really
my colors as well that I enjoy and you
know there's not one Newton here it's
all really bright and colorful vampy
shades I am just kidding of course they
are all nudes because hello that is my
safety net that is my comfort zone and I
just can't help it these are the items
that are constantly found in my clutch I
actually have doubles of a lot of these
in like smaller sizes but I also carry
around in my clutch mine is one of my
oldest favorites that I still so much
love to this day this is the Maybelline
a truffle tease and it's just it's just
beautiful it's just one of my absolute
favorite nudes it's not gonna do me
wrong it's gonna look good on my lips
every single time it's very creamy it's
not like a matte lipstick or anything so
when I just want that like really easy
to apply carefree nude lip I'm going
with truffle tease you know their staple
I actually have quite a few minis of
these but it is the hood of beauty this
shade isn't girlfriend it's one of my
favorites honestly I don't quite a few
nudes from hooda and I don't know if I
could tell you my favorite
I lost girlfriend though because it's a
nude but it's a little bit kind of like
on the like peachy side but kind of warm
at the same time it's just beautiful
this one is found on my clutch a lot so
are my minis from Poona this is one of
my favorite liquid lipstick or formulas
another one of my favorite lipstick
formulas is the Kat Von D everlasting
liquid lipsticks
I love them I grabbed out bow and arrow
I have bow and arrow I have a Ludwig I
have a mini of Ludwig that one is
usually in my clutch and really Kat Von
D she doesn't do me wrong her lipstick
our fantastic was new to me but this is
from Tarte this is a mini it came in a
Sephora give me some nude lip set this
is an rum punch it became an instant
favorite I love it again it's that
creamy lipstick but these color splash
lipsticks from Tarte are actually very
long-lasting and they fade very
gracefully on the lips so when I am
going out its rum punch it's rum punch
it looks so flattering it's a your lips
but better type of lipstick but it's a
long-lasting feels good quite a few
different shades of the color splash
lipsticks because they're bomb but
really wrong punch it has to go with me
at all times it just has to
and then the final lip product I have is
the Marc Jacobs lip gloss and sugar
sugar I have a deluxe size sample of
this one as well but it's always in my
clutch because it just it just needs to
be because this lip gloss is the bomb so
there is the swatch of that right there
it is a lip gloss but it does have some
pigment to it a little bit of shimmer in
it as well but it is just beautiful I
love having it in my clutch because I
wear a lot of liquid lipsticks out and
you know they do start to fade at some
point if you're wearing them for a
really long period of time but you can
just put a little bit of gloss on it has
you know some beautiful shine and
shimmer to it but not enough pigment
where it's going to really alter the
lipstick color that you're wearing
because sometimes I don't want my gloss
to alter the color because I like it so
much so this one just kind of like
revives the lips and makes your liquid
lipstick lasts just a little bit longer
I just think it's fantastic it's
expensive but I wear the crap out of it
so it's worth it okay so that is
everything before my safety net and
makeup product some of my favorite
products that will not do me wrong I
would love to hear some of your safety
net makeup products and the comments
