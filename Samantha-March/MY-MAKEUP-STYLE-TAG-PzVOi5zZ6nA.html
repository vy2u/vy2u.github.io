today's video is going to be the my make
up a style tag video or saw LS do this
and then I also saw learn my Beauty do
this one and I really wanted to do it
since watching their videos I'll have
both of those illicit down below believe
this video was started by Lisa so I will
also have her channel linked in my
description box but I'm going to be
answering a few questions about my
makeup style so if you wanted to see
this tag video why don't I go ahead and
get started ok so the first question is
what kind of eye primer do you use and
why and then liquid eye primer or shadow
stick I'm not super particular about my
eye primers I do like to use one every
time I do my makeup but I don't know if
I am a super particular my favorites
right now are one from ELF
I don't know its name because it doesn't
say it on there it literally just says
elf
on it but that one does have a wand and
then also the Urban Decay primer potion
I've really been liking that one and
then the pier get a grip primer so the
urban decay and the elf one are kind of
similar to one another and then the pier
is a squeeze tube so I don't know if I
have a huge preference in what my eye
primer is like but I definitely like to
use one and I think that they are
important let's say it says to a to a is
what color eye shadow makes you feel
bold and pretty at the same time makes
me feel bold and pretty at the same time
I'm gonna have to go with pink for right
now I've been really into pink looks I
have pink on my eyes today I did film
this look for a first impression Friday
video so I'll have that one linked down
below because you're interested in
seeing how I came up with this look but
I really like pink because I do feel
like it's bold but at the same time I do
feel pretty in it but I don't feel like
too out of my comfort zone sometimes
when I wear certain colors especially
certain darker colors even if I like the
look I don't feel always all that
confident because it's just like a
little it's just you know you just don't
have your regular level of confidence so
I'm gonna say pink for right now I think
that would be my final answer to be is
what eyeshadow color do you least like
to wear and why and again I'm gonna kick
it back to probably some of like the
bolder
brighter colors just because I don't
feel as confident wearing them I didn't
make up look not too long ago with a
bunch of blues and like bright bright
blues I called it a peacock look and I
like to the look and I thought it looked
pretty but at the same time it's like I
feel like I have to constantly be
looking at myself like does everything
still look okay I'm not I'm not a
hundred percent on this so I think just
really anything that pushes me out of my
comfort zone is not my favorite to wear
because I can tell even just sitting
here filming on camera if I do a
different look and I'm not a hundred
percent with it I can tell in like my
mood and like how I'm coming across I
can tell when I don't feel completely
confident on camera so sometimes that's
one thing that I get really frustrated
when people say things like you need to
go outside your comfort zone more you
need to wear different this and
different that and it's like yeah but
then I'm uncomfortable so that's what
you want for someone because that's
really strange to me yeah like it is fun
going outside your comfort zone every
once in a while and mixing things up but
if you don't feel confident then it's
kind of like well that sucks
number three is do you wear it liquid or
pencil eyeliner and black or brown liner
what I'm doing a wing I typically do a
liquid liner and I typically do black
the DHC liquid liner is my favorite I
always like all of my makeup details in
my description box and whenever I have a
wig you probably always see DHC liquid
liner down there but for my waterline I
typically do a pencil and most times I
do Brown sometimes I'll mix it up and
I'll do a green or blue or purple or
things like that but typically in my
waterline I like to wear a brown because
it's just a little bit softer softer
than a black I'm number four is
covergirl or Maybelline and mascara and
that would be Maybelline for sure
Maybelline has some of my favorite
drugstore mascaras hands-down not even
just compared to covergirl but other
drugstore mascaras currently using the
Maybelline at total temptation a mascara
and it's the bomb I put it in my
favorite section of my last makeup
Buckley and so many people wrote in
saying you've bought that mascara as
well and you think it's just as good
which is awesome
number five is if you could shoot save
your brows permanently done or not wear
any blush for I think it says for the
rest of your life but I could
for the rest of your life which would
you choose we're gonna say that's what
it is so if I could have my brows
permanently done or not wear any blush
feel like I should say having my brows
permanently done because my brow journey
has been an intense one and to have my
brows and every day I think that would
be awesome but I'm not super into
permanent makeup I have friends who have
like tattooed liners and tattoo brows
and I don't know if I like the idea of
it because some days I want to do
different things and if I have my tattoo
already there well how can I mix it up
or do something different but or not
wear blush honestly I don't even think I
have blush on today I like blush and I
have a lot of blush but sometimes I
simply forget it especially with how
much bronzer contour highlight I use
sometimes I miss blush so I'm gonna say
blush not wear any blush yeah that's
what I'm gonna go with number six is
does your best friend or you wear more
makeup ah that would be me yeah
Shannon doesn't always wear a ton of
makeup and somehow she just she gets
away with it just fine I'm extremely
jealous of her extremely jealous of her
but that would definitely be me hands
down
number seven is who taught you how to do
makeup that would be the wonderful world
of YouTube I always wanted to learn and
figure out how to do my makeup but I
never could I would always buy so much
makeup and then not have any idea what I
was doing I was always that girl in
college like begging my friends like do
you have ten minutes can you please do
my makeup like that was me always asking
and it was a disaster and so when I
discovered YouTube and I discovered that
YouTube makeup tutorials out there it
just it's a beautiful thing man
so YouTube YouTube definitely taught me
how to do makeup let's see number eight
is are you a fan of cream products such
as blush bronzer contour etc why or why
not
you know I used to be probably like last
year I was doing a ton of cream contour
especially but lately I am just not as
much anymore I don't think I've ever
really been a fan of cream blush I'll
say I don't think that's ever been my
thing but definitely cream contour I was
to for a while and now I'm just more
into my powder products and that's the
same for even like highlight I do have
some cream and liquid highlights but I
just prefer my powders over them I don't
know if I have a good reason for it
though it's just kind of like my my
preference right now and who knows when
it'll switch back I mean it's always so
interesting especially when I do like
flashback Friday videos and I think back
to what my makeup style used to be even
the year before you know things changed
quite a bit but right now I'm not super
into cream products I'm definitely more
in to powder number nine is are you a
project panner and what projects are you
in right now I don't know if I would
consider myself a project painter I know
there's a big project pan you know
community here on YouTube and I've done
a few project pans I did a skincare one
with my friend Lisa Stevens where we
panned ten skin care products or we went
through ten skin care products in two
months and then I also kind of on a whim
decided to do the eighteen and twenty
eighteen finishing eighteen products
throughout the entire year of 2018 so I
will have that video listed down below
and I'm really excited to do that one
but I almost kind of want to do more and
I saw Lauren my beauty also say that she
does like a monthly like use it up
project use it up and she doesn't like
every single month for not just makeup
but like skin care and hair products and
things like that and I've really been
considering doing that if you guys would
want to see that maybe like every month
or every other month from me let me know
what you think of that idea because
sometimes especially with skin care hair
care I get a lot of like mini sizes and
I use them for a while and I stop and
I'm like I wish I did something like
that or each month I had like my set
products that I'm going to use because I
want to use them up I thought that was a
good idea so if you guys would like to
see that for me please let me know but
right now the only one that I'm
currently in is my 18 and 2018 a project
pan but I'm open to four and then the
final one is setting spray do you
believe in it and which is your holy
grail setting spray is another one that
I really never understood why people are
using it I thought it was so silly I
didn't think it would work and now I am
a firm believer in setting spray and I
have quite a big drawer full of them so
I do believe in them one of my favorite
things to use a setting spray for though
is to kind of like melt the makeup into
your skin to make your skin look more
natural especially if I'm doing like a
coverage foundation or I've done a lot
of powders on my face like if I faked my
face baked my under eyes or I've put a
setting powder on my face on top of
foundation I really like to use a
setting powder because I just feel like
it just kind of makes everything look a
little bit smoother and a little bit
more flawless so I really do like
setting sprays for that reason and do
believe there are some out there like
the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray is I do believe help make your
makeup last that's one that I've noticed
a difference with I like the Smashbox
primer water for before I started makeup
look I like that one as well
mac fix+ is probably my oldest most
loved setting spray like my original
setting spray and it's actually what I
use today and I still enjoy that setting
spray and then pixie also has some
really good ones if I had to pick like a
Holy Grail that's really really hard but
I'm looking at my makeup drawer that has
my setting sprays in it cuz it's open
right now cuz I just pulled up Mac fix
plus I'm looking at it right now and
seeing some of my favorites in there but
I like sevens first two that do
different things some can make you more
luminous that some can make you
mattifying some are for more for primers
or some are more for a setting spray and
all of that but I definitely do believe
in setting sprays but after that that
was the tenth and final question
oh quick one so that's gonna do it for
today's video and the my makeup a style
tag I bet you enjoyed this tag video and
see we can serve a few questions on my
makeup style I would love to know if you
