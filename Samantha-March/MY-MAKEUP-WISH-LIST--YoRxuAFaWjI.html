in today's video is going to be my
makeup wish list obviously I'm not going
to go through my entire wish list
because this would just be like a number
end dating video we could be watching
this for days
when I picked out and figured like 9 or
10 items to talk about that is currently
on my makeup wish list I got the idea to
do this video too simply by talking to
you guys but especially on snapchat I
was having a lot of conversations the
other day with people and I kept finding
myself saying that's on my wish list
that's on my wish that's like maybe some
day I can get those because it's been on
my wish list I'm like I shouldn't do a
video about it and just let you guys
know what's on my wish list right now
what I really want to get may be what
I'm saving my money for also because I
really want to know what is on your
guys's makeup wishlist because I just
find that like so interesting when I was
having these combos over on snapchat and
people are saying this has been on my
wish but I'm like oh that's a good thing
to put on my wish list to like I was
doing even more ideas and it's just
really fun and interesting to see what
people are saving up for and what they
really want and what's on their makeup
wish list so before we get started out I
say thank you for coming on my channel
and clicking on this video I do post
videos four times a week on Wednesdays I
have my will i buy it series and then I
also post on Thursdays to Sundays and
Mondays so if you aren't yet subscribed
I hope that you will consider hitting
the subscribe button
but now if you would like to see some of
the items on my current makeup wish list
let's get started so something that has
been on my makeup wishlist for such a
long time is a brand in general I don't
have anything from this brand yet and
that is Natasha - Nona of course Natasha
Jinora is known for being very very
pricey so that's a really big reason why
I don't have any of her products yet one
thing that I really have on my wish list
right now that I've really been eyeing
and really want to save my money for is
her sunset palette I can insert a
picture down here and I think it is so
beautiful I would absolutely love to try
her shadows I hear amazing things about
her eyeshadow palettes she's definitely
been a brand that has been on my radar
for a while but again the price point is
just like like freaks me out the sunset
palette is 129 dollars and that's just
it's just a lot of money you know I've
also been saving up to get my hair done
I haven't had my hair cut or highlighted
since October I mean when I get my hair
done it's $100 the sunset palette is 129
dollars it's like oh my gosh you know
it's sort of like what are you going to
do I really maybe one day I'm going to
get my hair done I have a really hard
time I'm self-employed have a really
hard time doing nice things for myself
it's hard to know for me go get my nails
done once a month I let them go out to
the point where they almost fall off and
I'm like fine I'll go spend 25 bucks on
my nails like I just have a hard time
doing it but enough of that rant but
Natasha Genoa is definitely on my makeup
bushels I really hope one day to be able
to get an item but especially this one
soft palette I've been eyeing really
hard but I'd love to know what you guys
have from Natasha Jenna what do you
absolutely recommend that you think is
definitely worth the value or do you
have product from her that are not worth
that high price tag I would love to know
your feedback so I recently put a
Lancome a foundation on my wish list now
for my wish list I didn't say this in
the beginning but sometimes I literally
just keep a note in my phone it's called
makeup wish list it definitely uses the
for love list and then also have their
own you know like wishlist feature I
find those so completely helpful so that
all the time will I put those items on
my actual one in my phone but if I'm
buying from like other online retailers
or something in a drugstore that I want
to remember you put it as a note in my
phone and then it can constantly look
back on it or if I get something it's so
fast going to go and take it off the
list
oh that's a great feeling but another
one that I just added to my list to see
Lancome hence I told ultra long wear
foundation I'm probably totally sending
that wrong but school there's a lot of
people talk about the foundation how
good it is how good it makes the skin
look how long-lasting it is and I have
recently like what's in the past like
two or three months I've been becoming
so much more interested in foundation
like prior to that I was mainly just
buying drugstore foundations L'Oreal
Maybelline NYX and I was really happy
with them and then I started getting
into like the higher end brands for
foundations and I was like oh well these
are quite lovely as well and a lot of
them I am finding worth of price tag so
the Lancome one is $47 and it says it's
an oil-free long wearing liquid
foundation that delivers medium to full
coverage and leaves a natural-looking
velvety matte finish for up
24 hours Fessenden same claim 24 hours I
like I would never need to wear my
foundation for 24 hours but a lot of
people are saying it's like their
longest lasting foundation ever
$47 it's really not a bad price and you
get the standard 1 ounce I like that it
says medium to full coverage because I
Stephanie weren't finding myself these
days like the light to medium I'm just
like not finding it good for my skin
full coverage not loving it but like
medium to soul is like my sweet spot for
foundation so I really like that it says
that if it's the reason I'm kind of
holding myself back from buying it right
now it's because during the vib sale I
bought the Tarte brain force of the sea
foundation which was like 39 40 dollars
maybe and then I also bought the
hourglass vanish stick foundation which
was in $40 range I want to say $44 and
then I just bought the Tarte clay stick
foundation for $39 which I actually
don't really love I do have a review on
it
I like the other two foundations I
mentioned but this last one I don't
really love so I've been buying a lot of
foundations recently and higher-end
Foundation's home like oh should I spend
the forty seven dollars on another
foundation like or is that kind of
extreme so I just know if you guys have
tried this Lancome foundation and what
you think of it or some of your other
favorite foundations because the serous
labeling I'm just I'm on a foundation
kick right now
of course I have some lipsticks on my
make up a wish list so one that I have
on here is the Make Up For Ever artist
liquid matte lipstick I think it only
has six different shades I'm looking at
my Sephora loves list right now and has
six different shades they're all $20 and
it is a nude shade range and I had
spotted these before you know I saw him
on our website I saw reviews here and
there but nothing that like really
sparked my interest and then recently
Jacqueline Hill did I think it was a
haul video that she did and she had
gotten a couple of the Make Up For Ever
lipsticks and she was washing them and
she was saying how great they were and
they're all the news which is totally my
game but she was just saying how much
she likes the formula and I don't really
have much it's anything from make it
forever like maybe a sample here and
there but I've never purchased anything
from makeup forever I'm pretty sure I'm
saying that correctly and I would
to be able to try out new brands and try
a new liquid listed formula because it's
like one of my favorite things to try
out in such a lipstick junkie I love
that all of these are new shades $20 for
a little--it lipstick again not terrible
I just bought a new huda beauty liquid
lipstick which I'm wearing and
girlfriend these are $20 I don't have a
problem spending $20 on a liquid
lipstick as long as I think it's really
good looking at the reviews on Sephora
it sounds like a lot of people really
like these as well so I think the next
time that I do place an order from
Sephora which I feel like will be pretty
shortly I think I am going to pick one
of these up I have excited in which
shade I've been watching swatches I went
back and watched Jacqueline's video
what's the more swatches and just seeing
what people are liking but you have
tried it these liquid lipsticks from
Make Up For Ever let me know and let me
know your favorite shade but I think I
definitely need to give these a world
another item that I put on my wish list
and it's so funny because I did it will
I buy a video and I thought I wasn't
going to buy it I didn't need it I still
ended up putting it stealthily on my
wish list before I knew I was making
this video but I was like you know what
whatever you know sometimes we change
your minds and that happens but I
definitely do still have it on my wish
list even though I haven't been able to
bite the bullet yet by it but it is the
best cosmetics and Chrissy Teigen
collaboration it's a face palette it's
$46 and a really beautiful face palette
it has a really nice bronzer I'm hearing
amazing things about the bronzer a nice
blush in two different highlight shades
it looks so beautiful I really like
Becca cosmetics I like Chrissy Teigen
she's not my favorite but I don't
dislike her and the packaging looks so
gorgeous I'm hearing really good things
about it and I think kind of what made
me decide to put it on my wish list is
because I've been watching lottery hands
a bit and a lot of people are saying
they love it my friend Michelle on
snapchat I swear she's about there's
been so many times she's like girl you
just need those and I'm like check out
check out so like I just there's
something to me that I just can't make
myself do it and I think it's because I
love my Becca and Jaclyn hill
champagne face collection so much what's
it called the champagne glow face
collection it has the three blushes and
the two highlights in there
I love that thing and I reach for it all
of the time but because you know I have
a large makeup collection when I say I
reach for it all the time I mean like
once a week because I have so many other
bronzers and blushes and highlights that
I'm going through and I'm trying new
things and I'm you know try and
circulate through my makeup collection
so I'm like is it really worth it is it
a smart purchase for me I'm just not
sure but I really do like it and
especially now that I'm hearing the
review coming in and everyone is loving
it I'm like should I just go ahead and
do it it's 46 dollars I don't think it's
a terrible price you know it's expensive
of course because it's Becca cosmetics
and it's a collaboration with Chrissy
Teigen so obviously it's going to be a
bit of a higher price tag but what do
you guys think I should do if you think
I should get it who has it let me know
what you think let me know if you think
I should just do it I want to know your
thoughts another eyeshadow pellet a very
expensive I show up how is that I have
on my makeup wishlist and that I have
had on there for a very long time is the
visor or a busy our eyeshadow palette
these palettes looked so pretty they're
on mice for Lovelace I'm looking through
them the warm neutral mass is the one
that I liked most recently definitely
has my eye on the neutral matte I think
is very pretty as well but they have a
lot of difference i shadow palettes are
they are $80 and the still offensive
like I complain about like $40 eye
shadow palettes I'm like I don't know if
I can do it and then I'm talking about
$80 and 129 dollars in this video but
this is why these are on my wish list
why I don't have them yet I just have
trouble spending a lot of money at one
better like what I was trying to tell
you was like my nails versus getting my
hair done my nails are like twenty
dollars at a time but my hair is a
hundred I have a hard time paying a lot
of money upfront so it's just like poof
there goes a hundred dollars and you're
like oh Nessus oh so I know people like
break it down by ounces and number of
shades you're getting and all that good
stuff but bottom line is you're spending
$100 at one time aren't the video you're
spending $80 at one time it's still a
lot of money at one time and I think
like that mental part of it is something
that's hard for me to get over I know
some of you guys are like that too
because I have right
comments in my documents not chatting
you say the exact same thing so I know
I'm not alone there maybe not everybody
will get that but I think that some
people will so that's just kind of why I
have a hard time spending a lot of money
for I shadow pellets when they're just
that pricey but I hear so many good
things about these like so many I don't
even know how long it's been since I've
had these on my wish list because it's
been such a long time I definitely have
visors the zoo yards i shadow pellets on
my wish list maybe one day I'll get some
fiddling so in the conference do you
have any of the eyeshadow palettes do
you think they are worth the age data
price tank I was up to no so I have
another lipstick on here and this is
actually from mac cosmetics and I
thought this was kind of interesting
because I'm not really like a Mac girl
I'm not like super obsessed with mac
cosmetics I don't have a lot from them
you know some brands you're just super
loyal to some brands just don't excite
you in Mac as a brand that just doesn't
excite me I don't really have anything
like against Mac or anything like that
it's just a brand that doesn't really
call out to me but again I was watching
a Jacqueline Hills Halle video I believe
it was the same one that she was talking
about to make up forever lipstick and
she was talking about the Mac retro
liquid lipsticks retro matte liquid lip
color is their correct name so they are
$21 and one thing that I noticed is I
can you can get Mac o an alpha now but I
could not find these on the Ulta website
retro matte liquid lip color Jaclyn was
saying that she thought it was just such
a good formula she liked the different
shades of it I was watching the swatches
of the ones that she had and I put it on
my list because like I said when I was
talking about to makeup Forever's I just
love finding new liquid lipsticks and
new lipstick formulas that I just
absolutely love so when I was watching
her haul video that was when I put that
on my wish list I want to know if you
guys have tried this yet again what you
think of it that's another liquid
lipstick that I want to try out I enjoy
trying how different looks with formulas
and I have been able to try out a couple
lipsticks from Mac my friend Kelly did
send me a couple of their lipsticks and
I had a really good time with them I
should really love velvet teddy but the
other one she gave me was modesty and I
really love
that one too those are more of like the
regular lipstick formula but I'd like to
try to look at lips and see what I think
$21 I don't think is too bad either but
let us know in the comments as we tried
this from Mac or if you want to try it
their retro liquid matte lipsticks so of
course my wish list wouldn't be complete
without some makeup brushes because if
you are not new to my channel you know
that I have a sick sick obsession with
makeup brushes I have been eyeing these
brushes for a while
they're from the SL miss glam I actually
recently started following SL miss glam
and that's what kind of got me
interested in her brushes all NL miss
glam she is a youtuber I'd love to watch
her videos she's very like girly and
pestle and all this fun stuff she like
makes me want to like reorganize my
office all the time and make it more
girly and colorful but she's super
beautiful and then she also has her own
makeup brush company which I just think
is amazing I love supporting girl bosses
and entrepreneurs I'm super super into
that so once I started watching her
videos and I saw that she had her brush
collection I just thought that was
really amazing and something that I
would love to support the reason why I
haven't quite done it yet is because the
brushes are pretty pricy like one thing
that I've wanted that was probably one
of the first things that it's on my wish
list was the macaron glam brush set so
you get six different brushes but it's
$80 pretty pricey and even though I love
makeup brushes I'm like oh do I need to
spend $80 on six aggressions I'm not
sure because like I love Sigma brushes
I'm always recommending Sigma brushes
and sometimes you can get huge full
collections like 13 15 20 brushes for
like around $100 mark so you'd be
getting way more brushes for just a
little bit more cost so it's kind of why
I haven't done it but she has these
makeup collections that she's done
collaborations with people like Miss Liz
Hart and Madison Miller and then she has
these glam brush books which I think are
really pretty and you're getting a lot
of different brushes in at the brush
books but so they each come with 25
makeup brushes and the brushes are super
pretty I mean I'll insert some photos in
here so you can
remember like super pre and just like
her by very like girly as some of them
have like tools on them and things like
that but for example like the glam brush
bucks with the 25 brushes is three
hundred and twenty-five dollars like let
me get my hair done three times three
times I could get my hair done instead
of buying a brush book but they're
really pretty and like I said I just
would really like to be able to support
a youtuber a girl blog and entrepreneur
I think that's really cool so I
definitely wanted to mention this in
this video and just ask if you guys have
gotten anything from SMS glam what do
you think of it do you think it's worth
the price tag and that I should get it
do you follow her on YouTube or
Instagram like I said I'm pretty recent
actually to her probably within the past
five or six months or so I would say but
I'm really glad that I started following
her I really liked her content and I
think her brushes are absolutely
beautiful so let me know what you guys
think about SMS glam below and if you
would recommend them to me flashes that
I have my eye on real hard are from
blinking youth and they are the Samantha
lashes alone share photos on here so you
can see it they look absolutely gorgeous
they look like lashes that scream my
name that are my name I mean I just feel
like we would get along so well but they
are $35 I don't think I've paid over $20
for lashes I think the huda beauty
Samantha lashes are the most expensive
lashes that I bought and they were $20
and I usually buy them like during a vib
sale it's like when I stock up on them
so I can get a bit of a discount so $35
for one pair of lashes is like so
extreme to me I've been hearing a lot
about blinking viewed from Amanda and
saying I love watching her videos and it
seems like she's always wearing the
blinking beaut lashes I think she wears
like Samantha and I'm the number two
lashes so I have them on my wish list
and maybe one day I'll be able to do it
but for now it just seems like 35 is a
lot to spend on lashes and I try to
think to myself like you're going to
wear them a lot you wear lashes everyday
like I take good care of my lashes I
think because I reuse lashes like a boss
like when people are like Oh Irene use
my lashes like five times I'm like yeah
fifty
like I don't play around I clean my
lashes I try to make my lashes last as
long as I can because I wear them so
much if I was just going through lashes
like every couple uses or whatever and I
was just starting them away to be
spending so much money on lashes so I
try to take care of them the best I can
and clean them and just be able to reuse
them as much as I can so I try to like
justify it that way like a little $35
you probably get 1 million uses out of
them but I don't know I still haven't
been able to do it I believe that you
can also get these on the morphe website
so if one can do it has their own
website I'm pretty sure I've seen on the
morphe site as well at the same price
there's been a couple of times where
I've almost done it on the morphe site
when I was placing in order but I
haven't yet the blinking of you to
Samantha lashes definitely on my wish
list let me know have you heard anything
up linking Beauty view tried anything or
do you have any lashes on your wish list
like me alright guys so that is going to
do it for this edition of my makeup wish
list like I said this is just a very
small portion of my wish list because
otherwise we could be here for days
talking about what I want to buy in the
makeup world but it really hope that you
