video is going to be a mini wishlist
video and I don't mean mini as like this
is just going to be a short little
wishlist video I'm talking about mini
makeup and skincare products travel size
products smaller versions if you will I
have had this on my list to do for such
a long time I personally love menus if
you watch my channel a lot I constantly
buy and recommend a whole lot of minis
when it comes to both makeup and
skincare
time's up products as you know certain
full-size items they're just so
impossible to get through so prefer to
purchase the smaller items of them so I
have seen at Kelly Gooch tube my
favorites here Kelly Gooch she did a
video recently on mineus that are a
better value than the full size and then
also Lauren my beauty she's actually
done two videos on minis both minis that
she thinks that are a better value and
then mini is that she would suggest not
buying just find the full size I'll link
other videos down below in case you want
to see more content similar to this but
if you're ready to see my mini wishlist
let me go ahead and get started
it so I apologize if I seem like a space
ski said if I don't look great if I'm
just all over in this video we were gone
all weekend and we came home to no
internet which when you work solely from
home that's very frustrating and it's
also a book release week for me my six
novel releases on Friday which means I
have so much to do my to-do list is
crazy so to lose internet I feel like I
could just burst into tears at any
moment so that's really fun and I love
minis I purchased a lot I recommend a
lot I was talking about this one in a
recent will I buy a video it's from
Natasha de Nona it's one of their new
blush and glow minis so it's a duo in
there but it's very small so it's $19
Anna Tasha Jonah came out with the like
blushing glow palette which are very
large palettes I believe they have the
six shades in there and they were worth
in the $80 range that you you obviously
are getting more shades you're getting
larger shades you're getting a bigger
palette and all of that where this mini
one it does still have a mirror which I
thought was interesting but obviously
you're getting very very like a very
small amount of product in there for me
personally I know like I know I hear
people and I see what their
saying and they're like it's so small
and you know it's not even the size of
your palm and you know all these
different things and I'm like I know but
for the actual product that's in there
how am I going to get through some of
these you know I don't think I've ever
hit pan on a blush don't think so
I don't think I've know I know I've
never hit pan on a highlight before so
for me I see zero issues buying minis
getting less product and not spending
that kind of money upfront and what I'm
gonna talk about in this video it's not
necessarily is the value better or not
for me it's a better value to not spend
as much money upfront and still probably
I'm not gonna make it through that
product so you know why not buy the mini
but I'm still interested in this one and
I've been hearing some good things about
it so I like that natasha is coming out
with many sizes recently I have the mini
sunset palette and I really enjoy it
because her prices are just so expensive
so that one is definitely on my wish
list also I have on there the truth
serum so this is from Lula Hendrickson
so they have a regular size which is $48
they also have like a big guy that's
even more expensive but their mini size
is $15 and I don't think that that's a
bad price either and I I really do like
skincare minis too especially if you do
travel a lot or if you travel on a plane
I just recently went to Oklahoma City
and one of my biggest struggles was I
wasn't going to check a bag which means
that you have to be very considerate of
what liquids and like gel products
you're bringing with you and you can
only put so much in a bag and it has to
go through security
it can only be a certain size so I was
very stressed out over my skincare
because I still wanted to bring good
products with me but I was very limited
on what I could bring so that's when I
really gravitated towards a lot of my
minis I love my truth serum I brought it
to Oklahoma City with me I took it on my
Arizona vacation recently with me I just
think it's such a solid product but I
feel like I think even Kelly said to
give the mini is the butter like per
ounce than the full-size so that's one I
have it in my collection now and I'm
almost out of it and I would definitely
repurchase that one again same thing
with the Smashbox a photo finish primer
Iser
the mini of this guy
fifteen dollars the full-size is 42 and
again this is another one when I first
hauled it people told me that it's
better to get the mini again per ounce
it's better to get the mini than it is
to get the full size and that was pretty
interesting to me but this is one of my
favorite primers I mean I rave about it
all of the time I'm about halfway
through with my primer which is so crazy
to me but for sure once I finished this
one I would purchase another mini so
that one's definitely on my wish list
but yeah I think this primer is pretty
done good so one item that has me pretty
excited that I think I'm gonna pick up
is Laura Geller has friendly come out
with many highlights which I'm very
excited about so the full-size Laura
Geller highlights are $26 but she
recently came out with the minis which
are 12 and once again I know people are
saying like oh my gosh they're so tiny
and they're so small I'm like yes
because I can't hit pan on a highlight
to save my life I have owned mary-lou
manizer from the balm for like four
years or something that baby doesn't
even have a dent in it I get it I mean
it's just crazy to me I mean for a lot
of highlights you need a very small
amount and it's only going on your
cheekbones I mean sometimes I can get a
little bit crazy but I'm not someone who
like puts highlight all over me and like
my shoulders and my collarbones like I
just never really get to that step so
I'm putting a very minuscule amount of
highlight onto my face so I can't get
through a full sized but I've always
wanted to try a laura geller highlight I
think I mentioned her in my products
that I'll maybe someday buy video but I
think the the many highlights are gonna
reel me in I don't feel like 12 dollars
is that bad to try out and I would love
to try gilded honey I know so many
people always talked about that
especially when I was first starting to
watch YouTube people were very excited
for it so a couple of Mac products that
I thought were interesting I found one
on the OTO website that they offer their
fixed plus but in a mini so these full
sizes are $26.95 smells so good but
these are $26 so they have mini sizes
4-12 and I want them just again to be
able to try
with or to be able to throw in my bag
when I was going on my Oklahoma City
trip I realized that so many of my
bottles were just huge and some of them
were even so this is the 3.4 fluid
ounces which you can take on a plane and
I noticed that actually a lot of my
sprays were right at that 3.4 fluid
ounces which I thought was funny
but because you can only put your
liquids into that is it a gallon size
bag I can't remember but you have to put
them in that clear plastic bag and you
only get one I couldn't fit this plus
all of like my other skin care and all
of my other liquids in there I couldn't
fit it all so I took my Revlon with me
and that was the smallest one that I
could find but I would love to have a
mini setting spray for like my clutch
when I'm going out or for traveling are
things like that and the fix+ is one of
my absolute favorites I just went
through a full size bottle of the fix+
now I'm moving on to the lavender one
but I would love to have a many of that
and then another item from Mac this is
their strobe cream I have wanted to try
an extra cream for the longest time the
full-size products of $34 or the minis
or the travel sizes are $12 hey I would
love to try it because I would love to
see if I even like it I'm not a hundred
percent sure I would fall in love with
the strobe cream because it's not a step
that I always take in my makeup routine
I see a lot of people put this on before
like their foundation to help give them
more of a glow or sometimes like when I
watch summer routines and such people
are just putting on the strobe cream and
like a little bit of concealer and maybe
powder and going out like that
so I'm interested in it I'm just not
sure I'd absolutely love it so would be
nice to be able to try a smaller version
than just going straight for the full
size but then even if I did really like
it I don't see it as a product that I
would use daily or use on a very
consistent basis so it might be harder
to get through but I really do I really
do want to try the strobe cream and then
also another one that I put on my list
this is the Becca highlights so a full
size but the highlight runs for $38
crazy expensive for one highlight but I
do it and I buy them Becca now has many
highlights about our $19 I mean these
highlights are super nice I love the
packaging on all of them about the
mirrors this is prismatic amethyst so
it's kind of like a special Beca
highlight but I really really do like
the back of highlights but I don't
necessarily have one on my wish list
like right now at this moment there's a
particular highlight I need but if in
the future bucket comes out the
highlight or I decide that there's a
past highlight that I really want to
give a go I am going to buy the mini
because there is no point of me
continually buying $38 Beca highlights
when she'll offer minis because I don't
get through them typically for my bucket
highlights they shatter and break before
I can hit pan on them I've had two
bucket highlights break on me I think it
is and that's rough because I'm not
someone who enjoys for pressing my
makeup and I'm pretty sure I'd do it
wrong so I would much rather purchase
the minis versus the $38 full-size
that's just a lot of money for a
highlight and then next up on my list oh
I have a Lancome mascara I have wanted
to try this one for quite some time this
is the Lancome monster big mascara so
the retail price on it is $25 for the
full size or you can get a mini for $12
truly I just like purchasing minis of
high-end mascaras I wear false lashes a
lot I don't have them on today because I
don't even know where my life is that
today this I this is like the quickest
makeup look that I could think to do and
still put it together and still fill it
for Instagram so I can have all of my
filming done so I can go back to my
friends house build and have time for
lashes today though but I wear false
lashes a lot I wear false lashes out I
wear false lashes for my videos
I just prefer false lashes so I don't
often get good use or use up high-end
mascaras or any mascaras so I would
rather not pay a very high price for it
so the so like I said the mini size is
$12 I think that would be nice to be
able to try it I feel like I've heard a
lot of people saying really good things
about it so I've kind of been eyeing it
but once I saw they had a mini I'm like
you know if I decided to try it I would
definitely purchase the mini size of it
it would help me get through them
I get you'd get such a feeling of
validation when you do go through makeup
and whenever I go through a mascara mini
I'm like yes girl even though it's not
the full size I'm still like patting
myself on the back for it I have another
backup product here this is the first
light primer so I have a mini here and
the mini runs for $18 the full sizes are
38 this is one of my favorite of primers
I actually just took it out of my travel
bag because we were out of town this
weekend and this is what I took with me
I mentioned in my declutter video I
recently did a primer declutter I was
like I only have like one or two uses
out of this primer but I'm going to get
those uses out and I think I used it
over the weekend and I think it's like
gonna be barely one more use left but I
don't care I'm gonna get it all out of
here but this is a great primer and I
think I've seen people say once again
there's a better value to buy the minis
of this one than the full-size but again
primer it's something that I do use
pretty consistently when I do wear
makeup but I have quite a few primers
again if you watch my declutter I did
pretty good job too cluttering them but
I still have a lot so it's not something
that I go through on a very consistent
basis as well so I would just rather get
the full sizes or I'm sorry I'd rather
get the mini sizes and they're also
easier to travel with that is the primer
I also took on my Oklahoma trip with me
and then oh another one that I put on
here I don't know if I'll really do this
one but it's the hourglass ambient
blushes or the ambient bronzers I'm
interested in them both so the full
sizes are $38 which again is super
expensive the minis are 24 which I wish
it was just a little bit cheaper but you
know hourglass is just a press of Frizzi
brand but I do have a one here this is
the ambient lighting blush in ethereal
glow I mean I like the packaging on them
I like that you get a blush this one is
really really beautiful the ethereal
glow it leaves such a light flush on the
cheeks but so it's just like beautiful
and natural at the same time I really
really do like it but definitely the
full-size that is so pricey so I think
if I were to repurchase these at all or
you know I wanted to purchase another
one I think I would definitely go ahead
and go with the mini I still wish it was
just a little bit cheaper but
I mean again I just don't feel like I'm
ever gonna hit pan on that product so
why paid the extra money for a full-size
product Charlie won't come to a surprise
again if you are familiar with my
channel but I also have on my wish list
huda beauty liquid lipsticks the mini
sizes these are what the minis look like
I have a whole bunch of these and I love
them the hooter licks liquid lipstick
formula is one of my favorites but I'm
such a fan of buying minis really when
it comes to lipsticks brother its
regular lipsticks liquid lipsticks lip
glosses
I would love to have the option to
purchase minis on them because I have a
really large lipstick collection so it
is so tough for me to get through a
lipstick it's just hard because I'm
constantly rotating my lipsticks I have
so many favorites that I want to wear so
I have zero issues buying these minis so
hooda beauty offers a couple different
sets you can buy two with mini lipsticks
in there and like a lip pencil but kind
of what I've been doing lately that's
kind of how I first started buying her
lipsticks but the last two times I've
made purchases I've actually bought
minis that have four in here and they
are $33 for the four minis versus one
full-size is $20 so I still feel like
that's a good deal you get quite a few
different colors to try and again i'm
just i never go through these especially
at the hood of beauty liquid lipsticks
they are very liquidy and you need very
little product to cover your entire lips
like I do have one or two full size of
her lipsticks and I can't see myself
ever going through them so the minis I
think are a great deal there's another
nude one that's for sale right now that
I've been kind of eyeing but I don't
think they're a bad deal at all
and then next up on my list oh this is
kind of random but I just mentioned this
in my last empties video but it's the
Brio geo mascara milk leave-in
conditioning spray it's nine dollars for
the mini at the regular is $20 I
actually had a mini and that's what I
put in my empties video and I think I
got it it's like a point perk or
something like that from Sephora and I
only got a couple uses out of it I
couldn't quite tell if I liked it for my
hair so I was like I don't know if I
want to buy the full size yet because
I'm not sure like I'm sold on it so I
don't know if I would spend the $9 on
getting the mini I don't know if I would
just get it as like a point perk or if
there's like you know one of those like
coupon deals with Sephora if I would try
it again just to make sure I want to buy
the full-size but that one I have it on
my Sephora love so uh so I was looking
through that loves as well planning out
this video and that was on there I'm
like yeah I really would like to try
just some other many of it just to see
okay next up I have on there oh another
one from Hooda Beauty but these are her
obsessions palettes so she also comes
out with you know like pretty large
shadow palettes I can't think off the
top of my head how many shades are in
them but they're in the $60 range like
$65 or she has these guys which are kind
of like the mini palettes and they're
called the obsessions palettes and I
have three of them now this one here is
the mauve obsessions but you can see
it's just a smaller pellet but you still
get a mirror you get nine different
shades here and these are $27 I did not
think $27 is a bad price at all for
these palettes irate eye I've talked
about them so many times on my channel I
know but seriously I have the coral one
on my wish list right now so again when
I was looking at my Sephora Lovelace
that one is right on there but I'm just
so impressed with these palettes and I
know that they're small and I know that
that bothers some people but I have used
this several times already I'm not even
close to using up even one eyeshadow in
here and for me with smaller eyeshadow
palettes I'm not someone who like I'm
someone who gravitates towards these
because I feel like it's easier for me
to create an eye look I'm not super
artistically creative so I like having
these because I like having a clear
vision of what I can do with each
palette so I prefer these honestly and I
definitely still want to pick up the
coral one so just two more items left so
I have another mascara on here this is
from a cosmetics it's the superhero
mascara so the regular price is $24 or
you can get the mini for $12 I've seen
it on the auto website I feel like I've
just seen a lot of recommendations for
this mascara and it's been one that I've
I had a couple of times but I've never
gone through and purchased it but again
because I'm not always only wearing
mascara and I'm also wearing false
lashes I would just prefer to get a bit
of a discount
try out the mascara see if I like it and
actually get through it quicker and then
the last item that I have on my list is
a dry shampoo and this is from batiste I
feel like I hear everybody talk about
batiste dry shampoo and how much they
love it
now the full-size is only nine dollars
which really isn't that terrible the
mini guy is four dollars again I don't
mind having mini dry shampoos I really
like from dry bar their detox dry
shampoo and I have a mini guy and I can
take that you know I put that in my
travel bag with me to Oklahoma City as
well so I have that option to travel
with it but I I feel like I have been
burned so many times by dry shampoos and
really just hair care products in
general I feel like your care products
can be such a hit or miss from person to
person so I feel like I have wasted a
lot of money especially though with dry
shampoos going in and kind of blindly
buying one and then you know trying it
three times and realizing I absolutely
hate it and then there was twenty or
thirty dollars down the drain so again
it's nice that the full-size is only
nine dollars that's super affordable but
still I would rather just get the
full-size or the mini size at four
dollars what do I keep saying that I'd
rather get the mini at four dollars just
to be able to try it out see do I even
like it more than my drive our detox
because I think that mini is like $13
which you know obviously that's more
expensive but like I know and I love
that one and I've been through several
of them so I don't know what you guys
think about the batiste dry shampoo but
other than that that is everything on my
mini wishlist hi guys I kind of can't
believe we made it through that video my
mind is so so frazzled at this moment
but I hope you enjoyed seeing what's on
my minis wishlist let us know in the
comments some of your favorite things to
repurchase that are of a mini size or
anything that you would have on your
wish list if you would like to see any
other videos kind of focused on minis of
makeup and skincare let me know or leave
any suggestions that you would have as
always if you guys did enjoyed this one
