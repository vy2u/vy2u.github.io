today's video is going to be all about
my favorite makeup brushes so I recently
posted a brush declutter video I will
have it linked down below and a lot of
people asked in that video if I would
also share one talking all about my
favorite brushes so I have my favorite
face brushes and also my favorite eye
brushes that I'm gonna be sharing about
a lot of brushes to get through so why
don't we go ahead and get started okay
so if you are wondering about this
slightly different eye look that you see
on me this went up in yesterday's video
I think it's gonna be where I was doing
my dose of close collab with a couple
different friends and I tried out the
negative space negative Lightner trend
so if you want to see me attempting to
do that on camera I'll have a link down
below I couldn't decide if I felt
confident enough in the makeup to go
ahead and film another video but then I
was like you know what it's fine and
screw it it has a corkscrew on it I
didn't even plan that I didn't even plan
that but that was pretty good okay so
anyways jumping into it my favorite
makeup brushes I love talking about
makeup brushes I love makeup brushes if
you did see my declutter I think it's
it's pretty clear how much I love
brushes so starting off first I really
tried to grab one or two brushes like in
each category to share like my top top
favorites for this video my most used
okay so a for foundation I have two here
and they're both from Sigma the first
one is the flat kabuki the f80 I mean
the SAT is my og she's I think she was
my first-ever foundation brush that I
ever purchased I said just put
foundation on with my hands true soy but
this is a fantastic foundation brush I
have several in my collection it was my
first like I said my first high-end
brush that I purchased so I really do
enjoy this one and then the other one
that I use really frequently is the 3d
HD max kabuki and this one is also from
Sigma as you can see this guy is just a
little bit bigger and I just kind of go
back and forth on on which one I prefer
this one I feel like covers more space
in a quicker amount of time but the f80
is just like my og but those are too
great foundation for
if I'm gonna apply powder which I have
been more recently I've just kind of
been applying a setting powder all over
my face this is the brush that I use
this is from morphe and this is the ìiî
it's fluffy but it kind of comes to this
point up here and I just feel like it's
really quick and easy to just dust
powder all over my face so a lot of
times if you watch like my Instagram
tutorials and I'm putting powder on this
is the brush I'm using and then for
concealer I have two main brushes that I
use for that the first here is the
supportin
I talked about this brush so much I love
this brush it's the airbrush concealer I
kind of just bought it on a whim one day
at Sephora I was like I need a brush for
that concealer thing that everybody does
I need to do that too and so this brush
said concealer on it and I was like sold
and I bought it but I actually love it I
use it so much I just think it's really
nice to get right up in there underneath
the under eyes and it's just one of my
favorite brushes in general and then the
other brush that I use really frequently
is another one here from a sigma this is
the concealer blend kabuki at the F 79
this one is a bit larger as you can see
so a lot of times if I'm doing like my
face first I'm doing my foundation and
my concealer I'll use this brush because
it's really quick and I can get
everything done
if I do my eyes first and then I move on
to my face I'm only putting the
concealer on my under-eye
I'm not also using it as an eye primer
then I typically use the sephora 57 but
those two are my most used concealer
brushes I also wanted to say I am the
best beauty blogger around and I forgot
to mention that I do have a code list
Sigma I always forget this and sometimes
I even forget to put it on the screen I
tried to remember then I forget and then
people ask me my code I do always have
it in the description box but I am ia
Sigma affiliate you're gonna see a lot
of Sigma brushes they're one of my
favorite brands and I've been buying
from them for a super long time but my
code is just Samantha at Sigma for 10%
off so if you want it thought I'd throw
that in here because I always forget cuz
I'm the best
okay so moving on this is a brush that I
use nearly every single day and it's
what I use it to set my concealer so I
put my powder on underneath my under
eyes and it's also from morphe and it is
the e of 49 so here's what she looks
like so it's like thicker
then it also comes to a point tip here
and I just dip it into my powder and
that I go really close underneath my
lash line to smooth out any lines and
then I kind of hit it on the side with
the powder and then I just tap it along
boom really simple it's a small task but
it's one that I do every single day and
this is the brush that I reach for the
most for it
so for contour I kind of go back and
forth between a two one here is from
Sigma it's the powder sweep it's the fo6
so here's what she looks like I when I
got this brush I wasn't quite sure what
I was supposed to use it for and I think
it was a nikkietutorials maybe then I
saw I use it as a contour but it's so
small and precise that I can just get
right into your cheekbones to make a
really nice contour and then the other
one that I use is from the modem italic
line and this is their contour brush so
this one is a little bit more like it's
a little bit bigger but it's still dense
and then it also comes to the point and
again it's just nice and small you can
get right in there for your contour for
bronzer I have two favorite bronzing
brushes one here is from a sigma it's
the large powder f 30 so again I mean
this says it's a powder brush I use it
as bronzer it's just a nice a fluffy
brush but it's not like it's not like
too big it's not too much especially if
I'm using kind of like a darker bronzer
and I want to make sure I want to be
more precise this is the brush that I'll
use because I feel like it just gives me
that nice bronze if you will if I'm
using one where I'm like I'm just gonna
go ham on this bronzer I use my Big
Daddy from morphe this is the are too
this is a very very large bronzer brush
and like sometimes I just have to be
careful because it's big and they can
get out of control in a hurry so I'm
using a bronzer that's maybe a little
bit lighter and I know that I need to
build it up or I'm just not as concerned
about it I'll reach for this one I mean
it gets the job done and gets the job
done quick and I love this brush but
yeah be careful with it so moving on to
blush I have two blush brushes that I
use most frequently this one here is
from Sigma it's the large angled contour
the f40 this one is just like my little
mini guy but I have a full-size of it as
well um both of the brushes that I'm
gonna mention are this just these like
ankle brushes here but I really love
them for blush and I just feel like I
feel like they do great things so that
one's from Sigma the other one is from
Morphy it's the e4 I remember Jaclyn
hill saying this was like the best blush
brush ever of all time so of course I
bought it and I do really like it I
think it's a nice blush brush you can
see I used it today and I really enjoyed
this one as well this one is super super
soft also but yeah these definitely are
my two favorite blush brushes and
they're very similar to one another a
lot of people do ask me you know is it
better to spend more money on Sigma
brushes is it better to go the more
discounted route for the morphe brushes
and I I think it really just depends on
what it is that you need when I was
starting out as a beginner and I wasn't
really sure about a lot of things I was
buying cheaper brushes that wouldn't
last me as long but I was still learning
on them almost and then I started buying
from Sigma and you just get really high
quality with Sigma like none of my Sigma
brushes have ever fallen apart or
anything like that they have a two-year
warranty on all of their brushes they're
just really solid brushes and they're
gonna last you a long time but more if
he does have some good brushes I would
say with morphe if you buy things from
the elite line so it would start with an
e like this one is the e4 they're a
little bit pricier but not too much
those are really good brushes the
gunmetal brushes if they still have that
set those are good brushes there are
rose gold set those are good brushes
some of them that start with M I can
tell kind of fall apart a little bit
faster get scratchier after you wash
them but they still have good brushes in
certain lines but you'll see a lot of
Sigma a lot of morphe I'm not a morphe
affiliate I am Sigma but I just like
both of their brushes so that's all okay
so moving on to highlight how you picked
out three highlight brushes good good
good narrow it down to two nope okay so
for a highlight probably my favorite
favorite highlight brush is the Sigma
fo3 this is a great highlight brush I
love it if you saw my declutter I had
like seven of these brushes I declared a
few but I think I still kept like three
or four or like it's crazy a lot of
people compare this one to the Anastasia
highlight brush it's like the a 23 or
something like that I don't have that
one but by looking at it it does seem
pretty pretty similar
it is really dense but it's also small
and just precise for your highlight I
think it's wonderful
another one from Sigma
this is the tapered highlighter this is
the f-35 again I have a couple of these
as well I like it because you can hit
the highlight right on the point you can
kind of rush it on the side here so you
kind of do whatever it is that you want
to do it's also really nice this one
here I think is nice for nose highlights
I feel like it's really precise to get
down your nose and then the other one
that I really do use this one quite a
bit it's from Luxy it's the 522 tapered
highlight brush I got this in like a
subscription bag but then I also got
another one and I did keep them both
because I really do like these this one
is a very fluffy brush I like this one
for a highlights that are super super
intense like the persona highlight that
I have on today very very intense
because it's really easy to just dip
into this and then you can kind of just
it off real quick so you're not going
like too overboard even though you might
be thinking differently right now with
like the fo3 this is really dense
so if I have highlighters that are a
little bit more challenging to use or I
just want to like really get a lot of
oomph out of it you can really take this
one and kind of dig it into the
highlight to get more out there but yeah
I love I love altar eat these brushes I
couldn't narrow it down glue ready let's
move over to my brushes so this is a
really random thing but it's something
that I do every single day so I wanted
to mention these brushes so I have two
here and these are for the purpose of
laying down any of my like first two
shadows setting my eye primer with like
a white or shadow is something like that
I do it almost every single day that I
do my eye makeup and these are the
brushes that I use the most for it so
this first one here is also from the
mode of metallic line it is the super
crease a brush and then the other one is
from Real Techniques it's the deluxe
concealer brush they are basically the
exact same thing but I just like
something like I don't know what it is
about this kind of like round it style
but I use them almost every single day
so I want to tell you about them okay so
for my big blending brushes I feel like
these are super important I picked out
three that I absolutely love and they
are all from different companies which
is neat but I think that this is this is
the brush that I grabbed first when I'm
doing any sort of I look like if you
watch this tutorial from yesterday's
video the first brush that I use is a
big blending brush you can just kind of
be
a little bit careless with their just
throwing it into the crease just mixing
things up on there and you know you
don't want to do anything too precise
with this brush because it is bigger but
it's just a must-have brush in my
collection so the first one is from
Sigma it is the e-40 D tapered blending
brush I mean again this is one of my
first brushes from Sigma and once I got
the e-40 there's just no going back I
like it because it is a big blending
brush but out of the three that I'm
sharing this one is probably the most
precise it's not as precise as like a
smaller one or the e25 or anything like
that but I still feel like I have more
control with this one another one that I
absolutely love is from morphe it's from
their gunmetal lineup this is the g20 4
I'm so again it's just a big blending
brush but you can see it's a little bit
like it's not as firm as the e-40 but it
is also really soft which I do enjoy but
it just blends shadows so well onto the
eyes I really enjoy this brush but I
really I do need to see if they have the
gunmetal line still available because I
would repurchase another one of these
brushes because I feel like I wash it
constantly and then another one that I
have here is from Delhi impose Delhi
mootools is a brand that I was
introduced to fairly recently and I've
been very impressed with their brushes
they have really really good quality I
think this one here is the 785 it's
tapered a blending brush this one
honestly out of the three that I'm
sharing this one is probably like the
fluffiest but it's also this softest and
I just this is the one but I use for
this I look today it is just so quick
and so easy to apply that first shadow
into your crease I really enjoy this
brush again this is another brush that I
would repurchase to have another one on
hand for and then for the smaller
blending brushes I have the Sigma e25
like I was talking about so here's what
the e25 looks like and again you know if
you watched yesterday's tutorial I used
the del M tools first to put down some
of the lighter shades and then I take a
darker shade and put it on this pack
that shadow on the outer part of my eye
and then start to work it in it's just
smaller it's more precise you have more
control over where that shadow is going
and I have so many e25 that's crazy but
I have to use it like every single day
pretty much so there's that and then
there is a pretty good dupe though from
valium tools this is the 7/7
six blending brush so you can see it's
very similar to the e25 we'll put them
up together so you can see them the Dell
iam tools might just be like a little
bit wider a little bit fatter maybe but
they are very similar to one another and
again it's just a brush that I have to
have pretty much daily and then one more
brush that I wanted to mention I put
this one in my latest make up monthly in
my favorite section because it's just
become one of my go-to brushes it's also
from Sigma it's the Fermat blender II 44
now this one is kind of different
because it's truly like a blending brush
but also a detailed brush and one I
don't know how to explain it but you can
pack shadows on with this but at the
same time you can also blend them it
comes up to a point
it's like firm but it's also you can
still use it to blend this brush is so
cool and I really really like this brush
um I was using it in a tutorial the
other day that I posted on Instagram and
someone said what was that first brush
that you use I was like it's the U 44
and it's so good it's just one of my
favorite brushes and I find myself
reaching for it more and more lately
right moving along I have some more eye
brushes to recommend these are kind of
more of like the flat shader brush Azure
to apply eyeshadow all over the lid so
two of my favorites from a sigma Beauty
are the e 50 for and then also the e55
these are really really similar to one
another the e55 is just a little bit
wider and just a little bit on the
shorter side but this one here is the e
54 this one here is the e55 hopefully I
said that right yes I did but again
these are just some of my favorites to
pack shadows all over the lid with and I
have multiples of these as well another
one as well this again is kind of random
but I use it so often this is from Sigma
it's the cut crease
c62 I use this to apply in eyelid primer
onto my lid if I'm not using like my
concealer if I'm using an actual eyelid
primer this is the brush that I use and
I have a couple of those as well and
then this next one here is from Sigma
it's the cream color
58 and again this is really great for I
don't use cream shadows a time but it's
really nice for like foiled shadows or
even like glitter like I feel like it
just really gets on in there and helps
to pack them
on the lid this next one here is the
Sigma concealer the f70 I use this a lot
for my cut crease work it's really
similar to the other brush that I just
showed what's more rounded on the tip
here and I feel like I can cut the
crease better with it I'm still learning
how to do that technique but I use this
brush quite a bit for that one these
next ones here are really similar to one
another again just one's a little bit
bigger one's a little bit smaller this
is the Sigma II 56 the shader lid brush
again I feel like this is really nice
for like shimmer shadows with glittery
shadows foiled shadows anything like
that and it's also really nice and small
if I'm doing like a halo eye or a
spotlight eye I often reach for this
because it's really precise to get right
in the center of my eye there and then
this one is even smaller it's the shader
in recorder from Sigma the e46 so you
can see really similar but again if you
just want to get a little bit of the
inner corner in there you actually want
the inner corner or again just if you're
working with any sort of like detailed
work and you need a really precise brush
this one's pretty darn good then the
final brushes that I want to talk about
are more like detailed brushes for like
lower lash and things like that um I
always use a pencil brush pretty much
every single day I'm reaching for a
pencil brush to smudge out shadows on my
lower lash line I'm most often I'm
reaching for my Sigma pencil brush this
is the e30 so again just a pretty
standard pencil brush it's nice and firm
so I can really get under the lash line
and get those shadows on there another
one is from morphe it's the m50 7 again
really similar just another pencil brush
this one isn't quite as firm and if I'm
really doing like smoking any shadows
out on the lower lash line I'll reach
for this because it doesn't have that
precision of the e30 and I can be a
little bit sloppier with it and then you
guys probably seen this personally every
single one of my tutorials cuz I use it
pretty much daily this is the more feet
ether t6 this is just like a little tiny
baby brush I use this one for my inner
corner highlight and also a brow bone
highlight and it's my favorite I don't
know why I don't have several of these
as well but luckily it's pretty much the
same color a lot so it's really easy to
wipe it off and then you you know it's
not like I'm using dark colors or
anything for my inner corner but I love
this brush as well so those are a few of
my favorite detail brushes but
after that let's gonna do it for my most
used makeup brushes okay so that is
everything for my most used and some of
my favorite makeup brushes I again will
