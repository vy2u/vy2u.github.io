today's video is going to be my appear
cosmetics collection so I wanted to pick
up a new series where every month I take
you through a certain brands collection
of mine and just share everything that I
have from that brand so we are kicking
it off in January and we are starting
with one of my favorite favorite brands
which is pure cosmetics I decided to go
with pure to kick off this series
because like I said it's just one of my
favorite brands like obviously
throughout the year I'll be talking
about my favorite brands but Pierre was
especially special to me because I
started purchasing them way before I
even started watching YouTube videos up
back in my college days I stumbled on to
Pierre all by myself
just walking through alta one day and I
started to buying a from that brand and
just started falling in love with them
over the years and now since getting on
YouTube they're just a brand that I
continue to love and support purchase
from where and I just have so many
products from them that I love so much
so I know this would be a fun series to
take you guys through my collection so
today's video is gonna be all about pure
cosmetics let me know in the comments
down below what brands that you would
like to see in future videos like I said
I'll be doing these about once a month
so I'm just really excited to kick off
this series if you're new to my channel
welcome hello my name is Samantha I
posted videos four times a week
Wednesday's is my will I buy it
seriously posts on Thursdays Sundays and
Mondays sometimes I'll throw in an extra
video if need be but typically I will
post four times a week so I'll hope that
you will hit the subscribe button to
become a part of the famine or decide
when I post in my videos but that being
said why don't I go ahead and jump into
a my Pierre collection okay so before we
hop into it so you can purchase a pure
products from pur cosmetics calm they
are also available at Ulta can also
purchase them at Kohl's as well those
are where I typically will purchase a
from Pierre they might be available on
other like retailers and and in select
stores but I typically will either
purchase directly from the pur website
or mostly from Ulta but I have also
purchased in stores at Kohl's too so I
wanted to
that out there so the first thing that I
want to talk about is the very first
product that I ever have per gesture on
peer and like I said this was back in my
college days which was not last year
with you before or the year before that
so moving on so the first thing that I
ever purchased is this guy right here
this is the four in one pressed mineral
makeup so this is my new guy but I do
also have this guy so I have a new one
ready to go when I need it but this is
just a pressed powder I like it because
it comes with a mirror so I often take
this traveling but it's even easy to be
able to do my makeup and have the mirror
in here
like I said I mean I don't even know
what number this would be for me because
I started buying them when I was about
19 years old and that was 10 years ago
in case you're wondering so I get mine
in the shade can i've always purchased
the shade tan and i think i do that
because it helps give me a little bit of
color sometimes like not only does it
help smooth out your face and even out
your complexion
it also gives me a little bit of a boost
of color so I have always purchased mine
in the shade tan but I love this product
this was mentioned in my ride-or-die
video I believe I even mentioned it my
best of beauty 2016 video even though it
dinner at least in 2016 I am finding in
2016 but it's continually continually a
favorite of mine every purchase piece
for so many years so many times the four
and one pressed mineral makeup I think
it's just an absolute must have another
one of my absolute favorite products
from Pierre and if you watch my
Instagram makeup tutorials you're
probably not surprised because you see
this guy a lot but this is the Cameo
contour stick so this is what it looks
like so you have your contour side right
here and you have a concealer side right
here and then they just twist up alike
so I've mine in the shade medium I
especially love this for the contour
side and I'm not sure what it is because
I did mention this in my best of beauty
2016 video and I mentioned another like
contour duo stick and I
I like the contour side more so I don't
know what that is about these duo six
that I leaned toward the contour side
the concealer side to me was just a
little bit drying but what I actually
did was I tried that like flame hack
that you see on Instagram where people
are like lighting their makeup on fire
especially like stick makeup and they're
saying it's make it making it smoother I
honestly thought that that will worked
in the concealer side I actually did it
in an Instagram video and I thought okay
that applied like much more easier and
it just felt easier to blend out because
your under eyes can get very dry
especially for me especially the
wintertime and then like what I'm
feeling like I was having to like really
drag the product on my under-eye I
didn't like that and it was harder to
blend out but if I like put some flame
on it for a little bit it actually
worked out a lot better so I've been
doing that more even not just for an
Instagram video I've been doing it in
the comfort of my home office which is
funny but the contour side is absolute
key I love this and I know like I need
to switch it up and I need to start
doing different things on Instagram
because my tutorials are like look she's
using the Cameo contour stick again I
know but I love it I was super excited
to get this and yeah this is one that I
definitely definitely would recommend
okay so I think this is going to be the
only product that I wouldn't recommend
that wouldn't work out for me but I
think it's important to mention because
not every single product that a brand
puts out is everybody going to love like
it's just it's just not really possible
things are gonna be for you they're not
gonna look good on you you're not gonna
like how they apply it whatever it is so
I just want to be really honest um I
should have mentioned this in the
beginning here I guess but this isn't a
sponsored video peer doesn't know that
I'm making this video they didn't ask me
to make this video I just thought it
would be a fun series to do but I
definitely do want to to mention that as
well because yeah you're just you're not
gonna love everything it's just really
not that possible but this is the
Browder from Pier at the perfecting brow
powder I mean if you guys are not new to
my channel then you know that I don't
really get along the best with brow
products like I I'm not the best at
doing brows I'm not really great at
anything when it comes to brows so this
definitely could be more of like a user
error type of thing
I'm not gonna be surprised at all if it
is but this is what the applicator looks
like and I just I just was confused I
tried it several times and it is almost
like it's like a powder but then like
you put it on and it's almost more like
gel like I don't know it just was super
confusing to me I couldn't get it maybe
it was more practice I'd be able to get
it but I don't know this one just didn't
work out for me but unfortunately that's
the case but has anybody else tried the
Browder from pur cosmetics did it work
for you like is it just my fault because
I would totally claim responsibility
because because I'm not great at
eyebrows anyways another product that I
absolutely recommend and I take
everywhere with me is the pure hydrogel
lift I want to make sure I was gonna say
that right the pure hydrogel lift this
stuff is freakin amazing
so this is what it looks like and you
just run it along your under eyes and
it's like cooling I don't know how it
does it but it's cooling and it just
helps soothe the under eyes deep puffs
make you makes you look more awake I
travel with this stuff
I use it almost every single time before
I do my makeup like before I do anything
I will put this on first because I just
love it
I am such a fan of like under eye masks
love them go through them very very
frequently but this is so much easier
like you don't have to worry about
putting them on keeping them on or
anything like that you just run this
under your eyes and it's like you had
gel eye masks on for 10 minutes it's
amazing it's bomb I recommend this for
everybody this one is kind of a newer
product for me this is the pure joy
stick which is an exfoliating deep pore
cleanser so I haven't been able to try
this one out yet because oh I just tried
it twice just so I could like to see
what it was like and see what it was
about but not enough to be able to like
fully give a review on it but like this
is kind of like what the stick looks
like I don't know if he'll be able to
see that but it's an exfoliating stick
it reminds me a lot of like the Tarte
friction stick which I talked about in
my skincare video I haven't been able to
really test this one out yet because
this is something that I'll put in my
shower it's talked about in my skincare
video about how I like to keep like
masks and exfoliators and stuff like
that in
my shower and I have too much in my
shower right now like I don't need
another one so one of my like goals for
2017 is to be better at using things up
before opening things like that's like
one of my goals because those get a
little ridiculous in there but I haven't
able to test it out twice make sure I
didn't lean you know like break me out
make me sensitive I do have sensitive
skin so sometimes especially with
exfoliators I really do need to you know
test them out first before I start using
them on a regular basis this one didn't
irritate my skin at all felt really nice
and really just like clean it just you
know makes your skin feel clean like
everything's off and your skin's nice
and exfoliate it so you have the pure
joy stick I will be using this more very
soon so this palette I think is so much
fun this is the sun kissed glow strobe
palette so this is what it looks like so
it is basically cream highlighters you
have three different shades you also
have a mirror I like the packaging like
it's nice and like slim type of
packaging it's really easy to travel
with and it has the nice sized mirror so
you have your three different shades
here this is more of like a gold then we
have a rose gold and then we have more
of like a deeper bronze shade I
especially gravitate of course towards
these two but especially like the more
rose gold shade in the middle I really
love what I like about these is that
it's a cream highlighter so I talked
about how highlight can you know show
texture quite a bit and it's you know
when you have texture especially here on
your cheekbones and then you put
highlight like especially a powder over
it it's highlighting your texture that
is what it's doing so it's really tough
for me and I have actually found that
cream highlighters can tend to not show
the texture as much as the powder one so
I really really do like cream
highlighters or they're also really good
for if you if you're not dealing with
texture to put these down first and then
actually put a powder highlight over it
because then it's like really BAM really
in your face and really awesome so this
was one that I got it and I was like I
don't know you know we'll see what I
think about it and I do find myself
reaching for it quite a bit especially
this middle shade I think is beautiful
so that was the sunkissed glow
stroke palette another highlight palette
that I just found recently this is the
elevation palette so inside it does come
with its little mirror here and then it
has these three highlight shades so
there's Boost altitude and upgrade I
really like upgrade it's like a more
like a peachy Sheen type of color boost
is more kind of like the gold and then
altitude I'm not really sure how to
explain altitude because when you look
at it and almost looks like I don't know
if I want to say holographic like
iridescent type of shift to it but I did
I don't really notice that when I wear
it as a highlight it almost looks more
like just a white highlight so that one
I actually don't reach for a lot but
this upgrade is the one that I really
love the most just a really beautiful
like peachy highlight color and then
what I'll say about the pure
highlighters is that I don't find them
to be like the anastacio ones with their
super blinding and super in your face
they're more subtle highlights but if
you like that like the more like natural
you're just glowing highlights I think
the elevation palette is really good or
what I've done also is first coming with
the stroke palette and laid down the
cream highlight and then come over and
place the powder highlight and that does
give you more of the highlight effect
but yeah that is the elevation palette
if we are almost to the end a couple
more palettes to talk about this is a
new one to me as well this is the trolls
talent in collaboration with DreamWorks
from the trolls movie that came out this
is what it looks like it does have a
mirror and then these beautiful shadows
down here so this is a close-up of what
the palette looks like it's so beautiful
that I haven't used it yet and this is
really really new to me but every time
that I've gone to use it I'm like I
don't want to do it so pretty I know
that I just need to use it and I'm gonna
swatch a few right here because I know
if I swatch it then I'll be more apt to
use it but I just like it's just so
pretty
okay so let's swatch a few here together
okay there's a few swatches so that is
karma pop icon and branch so karma pop
icon and branch that branch color I'm
like I think that's what I want to use
when I do a tutorial with it and then
how about one more this is Bergen town
I'm not that's awesome okay I think of
what I want to do is actually do my
first Instagram alive makeup tutorial
using this palette so this one is out of
stock right now on the pier cosmetics
website but I did check Kohl's and it is
still available there it was also
supposed to be available in Kohl's
stores so I'll be able to find out your
clothes in stores but it is also
available on the clothes online website
right now is $29 again comes with these
shades like there's beautiful Browns and
neutrals in there but there's obviously
these pops of colors this hot pink right
here and then there's also this really
beautiful orange which I'm really
inspired by as well so just a really
beautiful palette I'm excited to create
my first tutorial with it again here are
few swatches from the palette it looks
beautiful
if you're not following me on Instagram
I'm just March Beauty word but I will be
doing a Instagram live with this
tutorial coming up so you don't look up
for that and then the other palette that
I want to talk about is the revolution
palette this is another eyeshadow
palette this one is only $15 it comes
with a mirror and then here are the
shades right here but it also comes with
a deluxe size of the folder Church
mascara here is a close-up of what the
shades look like I have used this I
believe I have a look that I can insert
here that I did for Instagram but it's
just like a really kind of like darker
smokier type of palette so they are
mostly shimmers these first four hours
and then this last one here is a matte
color so definitely more for like a more
dramatic darker smoky eye I would say
but if you like that I think that would
be really awesome because it does come
with a mirror it's small so it's easy to
travel with and like I said it comes
with the deluxe eye is fully charged
mascara and it's only $15 for this whole
thing that I was like that's a pretty
darn good deal in my opinion it's the
last stuff that I have to talk about is
lippies
so this came in a set it came with four
of the matte lipsticks and then also the
lip oil so I got this set of the perfect
matte lip set which came with all these
pluses of oil but you can get these
individually they're just the matte
lipsticks and they are $20 so my
favorite shades of course are these like
pinkish nudes they're in obey and
obsessed and I wear these the most the
darker ones I think we're okay but
they're definitely more like patchy err
then the nudes are like you just kind of
had to work with them a little bit more
so I definitely reach towards the nudes
the most you can get the set I'll be
with the set listed down below in case
you'd want to get them to try it out you
get little smaller sizes of them or like
I said you can purchase them
individually I like the formula because
they were more comfortable on the lips I
don't think that they're the longest
lasting liquid lipstick that I've ever
put on but they're also one of the more
comfortable liquid lipsticks like they
weren't super super drying so that's
what I liked about them but I also loved
this lip oil like really loved this lip
oh this is the fav a lip aisle so you
can wear it underneath a liquid lipstick
to help you know have it be more
comfortable you can wear it over a
liquid lipstick if you don't want the
super matte look I honestly just wear it
alone like just when I'm sitting at my
desk maybe I want to put chapstick on or
something instead I'm reaching for this
because it just feels like nourishing
and moisturizing on the lips and I
appreciate that like I love lip masks I
love lip scrubs I love lip oils and this
agave olive oil is no different I came
really obsessed with this after I got
the set so yeah the agave lip oil is
really good or else I would really
suggest the nudes from the liquid
lipsticks alright guys that is going to
