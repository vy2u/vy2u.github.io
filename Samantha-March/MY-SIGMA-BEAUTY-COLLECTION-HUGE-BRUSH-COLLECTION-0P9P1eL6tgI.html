today's video is going to be my sigma
beauty and makeup collection so i
launched a new series last month where
every month i'm going to pick a brand
and walk you through my makeup
collection with everything from the
brand so i started it last month with
pure cosmetic solid that video link down
below in case you're interested in
checking me out and this month i am
featuring a sigma beauty i'm really
excited to treat your Sigma because they
are definitely one of my favorite brand
I started purchasing from them before I
had my youtube channel they were my
first like higher-end brush purchase and
I was so excited for it and I can
actually remember the first package that
i ordered and continued to keep
purchasing from sig monetary and lucky
to now be a sigma affiliate sigma was
the very first brand that i became an
affiliate with i remember the day that
they accept me into their affiliate
program and it was just so crazy because
it was you know this is one of the first
bigger brands that i ever purchased from
this was the first hang of makeup
brushes that I ever views and you know
now they were interested in having me
join the family I just thought that was
really neat so I will have everything
that I talked about linked in the
description box below and those are
affiliate links you know a huge thank
you to sigma for having me in their
family i appreciate it so much I don't
have a code with Sigma like math or
whatever I just have the links right now
but maybe one day I'll have my own code
that you guys can use as well but I'm
excited to show you everything the
majority of what I have from sigma is
brushes i love sigma brushes i recommend
them all the time i'm going to go over
when I have from them makeup-wise first
and then I'll move into my brushes last
because it's a lot of Russians to hold
on to your hats I'm really excited to
share with you my sigma beauty makeup
collection and if you'd like to see
everything that I have from sigma beauty
please keep watching so one of my
hands-down favorite items from sigma i
recommend this all the time as well this
is their gel liner in wicked witch is
black I have it on my eyes right now
it's the first gel liner that I feel
like I really fell in love with I don't
know if you'd be able to see in there
but it's a it's nuts it's not looking
great so it's almost gone because i use
it so often i guess
this was the first gel liner that I
really fell in love with and this was
the one that I was like oh that's why
people like gel liner like it just
glides on super easily super smoothly I
do have a brush that I'll recommend as
well that I definitely say to use with
this liner but as an excellent liner
it's very black very easy to use very
easy to our quest glides on super easily
I love it so much it's a wicked gel
liner Zig save of mine thanks to make up
products that actually featured a while
back in like my most underrated makeup
video I did one a handful of months back
and I features both of these from sigma
and i am wearing both of them on my face
right now as well the first one is there
blush and this is in court of Rosa and
it says it's an aura powder and which is
a blush this is what the blush looks
like it does have a mirror as well and
it is what I have on my cheeks for my
blush it's a very beautiful blush kind
of like that terracotta type of color
and it is so pigmented like I remember
the first time using it and I you know
looking at it I'm like okay it looks
like a nice blush and I really went in
there with my brush and then put it on
and I was like whoopsies you need a very
very tiny amount with this blush because
it is so pigmented and it's also super
long-lasting I don't feel like enough
people talk about the slush and it's
gorgeous again- in coeur de rosa and i
think it is fabulous this is the lip
color that i'm wearing right now i also
featured it in my underrated makeup
video this is the power stick lipstick
in in space so this is what the
packaging looks like and it's very like
heavy like this is like a boss lipstick
and then when you open it up you have
the shade right here so again it's what
I have on my list but i really like
these lipsticks I feel like more people
should be talking about them okay I have
a couple of like makeup tools to go over
makeup essentials maybe you could say
but it's the first thing that I want to
talk about in this category is a brand
new product from sigma i believe at the
time that my video goes up this one I
even be yet for sale but you can fill
out the waiting list on the sigma beauty
website it is their new 3d HD blender i
use this today so you cannot be mad at
me i only have a limited number of hours
to film with natural sunlight so i
didn't have time to be cleaning
everything and my brushes are going to
be dirty as well because i use them all
on my face but these are
the new 3d HD blenders from sigma beauty
and 0 Sigma sent me these early so I
could try them out and review them and
let you guys know what I think about
them and I'm so glad that they did
because I am like I love these blenders
I'm a big fan of makeup sponges and
beauty sponges I've tried the beauty
blenders I have one from Real Techniques
I have the diamond sponge I definitely
tried a lot of the different blenders
and I was really excited for this one
because it has such this like unique
shape and has all these different angles
and has points I mean even when you flip
it this way you got more designs going
on and I was just excited to try it out
I will leave some videos link down below
to my Instagram where you can see me
doing a tutorial and using these so it's
like their possibilities are endless
when you get this thing wet it gets very
very large list that was the first thing
i noticed once i ran under water I was
like whoa that is a big makeup sponge
and then because you have all of these
different sides to it you can actually
do a full face of makeup was just your
makeup sponge and that's really hard to
do you can do everything with this fun
this is one that I highly recommend it's
going to launch februari 27th and it's
going to be fifteen dollars which i
think is also a good price the original
beauty blenders are twenty dollars and
you are spending fifteen dollars and
you're getting something that can do
your entire face of makeup foundation
concealer cream bronzer you can do these
little like this side this little edge
right here is like my favorite for cream
contouring and you can even go down with
type of your nose you can apply your
highlight to your face you can get right
in between your eyebrows you can get
around your lips over half your nose
like I mean the possibilities are just
endless with this thing and I think it
is such a good product the only thing I
would say about it is that I think it's
a little bit firmer than I prefer speaks
I like really bouncies makeup sponges
it's not the bounciest I've ever used
but that's literally my only con to this
thing otherwise I think it's fantastic I
think a lot of people will really like
these and I'm excited for them to lunch
I'm just been beating up this book on
this is what I've been going to every
single day as I've been testing it out I
wanted to leave one nice and pretty for
this video so you can see what it looks
like when you're not using it every
single day but this
3d HD blender from sigma beauty launch
and so very 27th i highly recommend it
guys next up I'm super excited to talk
about these two products because I feel
like these are essentials so the first
one that I have is the Sigma spa glow so
this is a tool to clean your makeup
brushes cleaning makeup brushes are so
important I know so many people that
don't see the importance of cleaning
your makeup brushes but it's so
important because when you're putting
those brushes on your face and you're
just spreading bacteria and germs and
putting all that ickiness back on your
face you're not washing your brushes and
I think having tools really help step up
my personal brush cleaning game because
otherwise I was always just using the
palm of my hand and it just gets gryllus
and it doesn't make your hand feel the
greatest it's not very fun so when I got
the Sigma spa gloves this is just like
an immediate game changer it's really
cool because it has these different like
riches and grooves on there so you can
clean all of your brushes it has like a
little flip here if you want to keep it
on your hand you share ken a lot of
times it kind of depends I guess on how
many brushes i'm cleaning sometimes I
keep it on my hand but sometimes I just
lay it flat in my sink and do it that
way they have other options of these
available as well they have bigger ones
that basically covers your whole thing
but I think these are great everyone
needs a tool like this I think I think
these are really handy and then the
other item I have to go along with that
is a makeup brush cleaner this is the
big magic shampoo and this was like
total game changer for me feel like this
was a pretty hyped up products but I
feel like it was for good reason is
because it's just awesome so to make it
worse cleaner it is one hundred percent
natural that was kind of like the big
thing around this this is all natural
and I think that's really important as
well when you think about cleaning your
makeup brushes because you want to clean
it with good products because again
you're then putting it back on your face
but I use this all of the time for
cleaning my brushes it's super easy to
use a few pumps I will say that it says
on here right it says pump one two three
times directly into damp brush fibers I
think that you need more than that like
in my personal experience I think you
need like six or seven and of course
depending on the size of your brush but
like for a good size like foundation
brush I think you
like seven pumps of the product to make
sure that you're really getting all of
it clean but it's just so handy it's
super easy to use it has a pump so very
easy I am I mean I have less than half
left and i'm so sad but i would
definitely repurchase this because i
just find it so essential in my brush
cleaning game so last step i have my
makeup brushes and i have a lot of
brushes from a sigma beauty i love their
brushes I think they're bob i recommend
their brushes to everybody and if you
can tell i love the sigma beauty brushes
this is definitely what I have the most
of out of my collection so that I wanted
to leave it for last I'll run through
each brush and kind of be used for them
and I came to let you guys know whatever
absolute favorites what I use on like a
very regular basis but go ahead and jump
into my brushes I'm not going to go in
any particular order i'm just going to
go ahead and set these on my lap and run
through them so the first one that i'm
grabbing out is the sigma f 89 this is
the baked kabuki brush so it has this
curved edge here kabuki brush what i use
this for is to bake just like the
setting powder till I clean up my
contour I think it's really good for
that I don't love it for under the eyes
because it's a little bit bigger but for
the size of the face I think it works
great ok i absolutely love I would
totally recommend that this is one that
I didn't think I would love her even
reach for a lot and I totally do this is
the struggling fan the s 42 so it's just
a little fan brush but it's like it's
dense it's not like a really flimsy fan
brush because I've had those a lot and
when you actually try to apply your
highlight it just doesn't really go
anywhere or do anything but because this
one is more dense and you apply your
highlight it actually shows up and it
works really well so that s 42 I would
also recommend this is the cut crease
e62 brush so this is what this one looks
like and this is what I use to apply the
concealer on my eyes when I n doing a
cut crease it's really nice because it
has more of like an angled tip so I can
really make sure and like sharply
cutting the crease with it I mean this
brush is made for cut creases and it
really has helped me out
I've never had a brush like this in my
collection and when I was practicing cut
creases in the past it was really hard
to be able to define a cut crease with
the concealer and I think some time in
this brush it really has helped me out
this brush is one of my favorite I might
have even I think I've put this in a
favorites video this is the fo six
powder sweep and so when I got this
brush I was like um okay so you use it
to like sweep the whey powder like I
don't know that just seems a little most
like booty like you needed a separate
brushes like just for that reason like
my other brushes work just fine it
definitely does good for that you can
sweep away your powder tsuboi the powder
it's also a really good highlighting
brush i will say that it's a good
highlighting brush because it's almost
like a little bit on the denser side but
it's still like fluffy up top I don't
know how this brush works but it can do
a lot of different things but
highlighting is definitely one thing
that it does very well but what I love
this for and use on nearly a daily basis
is for powder contour I have the
physicians formula they just came out
with like a trio of contour powders and
I am obsessed with using one of those
powders with this brush it has like
changed my contour game I swear to you
like I've just been loving it so much it
is perfect to get right in there and
create the contour this is what I love
this brush for like I said it has other
uses as well this is just a huge
favorite of mine than to keep it rollin
I have a deep bent liner brush this is
the b12 I was super intrigued to try
this out because I'd never tried a bent
liner brush and I actually liked it more
than I thought I was maybe going to I
was a little scared of like how is this
going to work logistically but I
actually like it like I said I like it
more than I thought I was going to and I
also like the actual brush of it because
it's so like thin and small and that's
what I really like in my liner brushes
but then it's really cool just to be
able to whatever type of wing it is that
you want the different ways that you
hold a can just really help you out and
make it easier I was surprised I was
surprised at this one I wasn't sure it
was something like do I need it well I
really love this this isn't my favorite
winged liner brush
from Sigma that one is still coming up
but this is still a really good one so
this one is the buffing blend the e39
brush and this was one that I was like
hmm okay lega I'll probably I think it's
fine but I don't know it's kind of a
thicker denser brush and when I first
tried it I immediately fell in love with
it and I reach for this one a lot you
can pack the product on there then also
a test let's be at the same time so you
can actually blend your shadows together
so it's kind of like a two-in-one brush
and I really like it i reach for this a
lot and this is also a brush that I
travel with a lot because I feel like it
has some multiple functions that's what
I look for when I'm grabbing my travel
brushes so this one comes with me a lot
so this guy is the 3d HD kabuki brush so
here is less this one looks like kind of
fun has the 3d effect to it now i'm not
going to lie when I say then I'm not
exactly positive why I enjoy this brush
so much because I don't know if I'd
quite fully grasp the concept of what
the 3d part of it is doing I just know
that it works really well and I really
enjoy it a lot of times what I do is
I'll put the foundation right on here
and then I'll take these like sighs and
I'll like smooth the foundation out and
then I will turn it so it's like this
and then I will buff it out I also like
the curve that I have because I feel
like it's easy to fit the brush like
around my nose and angles like this I
mean I don't know if this like helped
inspire a 3d HD blender i'm not sure but
i like the similar concepts I just feel
like it I feel like it has more than a
regular foundation brush you know what
I'm saying and I really appreciate that
so the 3d HD kabuki was another one that
I unexpectedly really enjoyed another
one that i'm pretty sure i've mentioned
in a favorites video this is the S 79 at
the concealer blend kabuki so what I use
this for is to buff out light under eye
concealer i have actually also used it
to blend out with cream contour there
sometimes when i was traveling and i
forgot my tool for that so i use this
and it works out just fine but the main
reasons that i use this for is for
under-eye concealer and I think it's
freaking bomb bomb I love this brush for
that I like that it's smaller yet it
still
big enough that you can actually blend
everything out quickly and easily but
it's small enough to really get up in
there under your lashes it smell enough
to get into the inner parts of your eyes
I just love it I I can't remember what
month it was that I put it in a
favorites video but I love this brush I
travel with it and I used it almost
every single day is the medium sweeper
e64 one of my favorite brushes one that
I travel with it very often because I
just feel like this is essential I used
it today to peck on the gold shade on
the inner part of my eyes for me this is
like my shimmer shade brush I knew that
was going to be tough to say so any time
I was playing like a shimmery type of
eyeshadow this is the brush and reaching
for if I'm using like a loose pigment
I'll spring my brush with like some
fixed plus and then I'll apply it yeah
this goes with me as well in my travel
bag this one is the p89 this is the
baked precision brush just like the
other like there was a bigger brush of
this guy and now this one is the smaller
one I like to use the bigger one for
along my face to like clean up contour
this is what i like to use under my eyes
and i like it because you can get right
up in there and it also has the angle to
it as well which i think is really
helpful so i use this brush quite a bit
so this was in my very first package
that i ordered from sigma i knew that i
needed to work on my winged eyeliner so
i purchased an eyeliner brush this is
the small angle e65 brush so this is
what it looks like and it's funny
because when i got this and i was
practicing my winged minor i really
really enjoyed this brush and i thought
it worked great since then i've actually
fallen in love with a different brush if
you guys have been subscribers of my
channel you already know what brush i'm
talking about but if you're new here
you're probably like what pressure
Shanghai just get on with it will push
do you use but I found after going to a
smaller brush that this one was just too
big so I don't use this one as much
anymore but this is like my OG my first
winged liner brush so the winged liner
brush that I absolutely swear by I used
today I use it so often i recommend it
all the time this is the e 06 winged
liner brush and I feel like a lot of
people talk about this brush but for a
very good
reason and it's because it's bomb it's
dirty because I just used it to apply my
wind liner it is so small and so teeny
tiny and so precise yet it makes the
best wing like I feel like what this
brush is hard to screw up and it's hard
to make mistakes because it's so small
that you can really build your wing and
for me and for someone who I'm still
learning how to do my wings I'm still
finding the best way for me to do them
for me to be able to build them up and
do the smaller stroke just works easier
for me than having a big brush and just
coming right in and trying to make wings
and then getting messy so this small
brush works out so much better the e 06
I think is amazing here's us with the
wicked gel liner it's just like a match
made in eyeliner heaven it's amazing and
then these last two brushes I feel like
I just so special to me because again
these are the brushes that I've made in
my very first Sigma purchase so the one
was the bigger winged liner brush and
then I have these two brushes as well
and it's so funny because when I was you
know before I had my youtube channel but
when I was starting to get Mars makeup
and I was watching the beauty videos
it's funny what I took away from it
because I took away that you needed to
have a fierce wing so that's I got the
winged liner brush when I also take a
way that you needed a fantastic
foundation brush and I also took a way
that you had to have a blending brush
like you needed those things in your
collection so the blending brush that I
had shows was one I saw a lot of people
recommend and it is it's the e25
blending brush and I love this brush I
love this brush so much i wish i had
like 40 of these brushes because i think
they are fantastic I definitely used it
today so you apply my crease shade and I
think it is so good I feel like
everybody needs that you 25 I know this
is a very like talked about and you know
kind of hyped up brush but for a very
good reason so I love this little brush
so much 325 I always recommend this as
well and in the last brush that I have
to share in the final product for this
video is the s80 kabuki brush everybody
was talking about the s80 everybody was
talking about it everybody was
recommending it and it's one of my
favorite brushes I this was like my
first real foundation brush my throat I
and foundation brush but it was also my
only foundation brush for
very long period of time this is the
only brush I had and I worked this brush
I've also had for many years now like I
should probably replace it just to like
give this one a break like let this one
go into retirement because it got used
and it got used hard but again one of my
favorite brushes a lot of people talk
about this one still to this day and
still really like it and I would
definitely agree i would always
recommend the FTE kabuki alright guys
that is going to be everything for my
sigma beauty and makeup collection i
hope if you guys enjoy seeing this video
