today's video I'm just all kinds of
excited for I'm going to be talking
about items so that are on my tax refund
wishlist with this video I've had on my
filming list for a while to do a
wishlist sort of video but focusing on
non makeup and beauty products I've done
those videos in the past makeup wishlist
videos
Sephora Lovelace videos things like that
but I wanted to do one focusing more on
the non makeup and beauty products IDEs
and I've been seeing more and more
people do this one recently and I'm
always so interested I love hearing
about other people and just getting to
know them a little bit more so I feel
like those videos are really interesting
to me but a couple weeks ago I had a
subscriber comment actually on a will i
buy it video and I deleted the
screenshot I do it so often because I'm
trying to clear up space on my phone
with the storage on my phone so I delete
it the screenshot but someone wrote in
and said one of the items I mentioned in
the will I buy it video they said I'm
putting that one on my tax refund wish
list I just thought that would be really
funny to kind of combine it with my non
makeup and beauty wishlist because it is
tax free fun time here in the US and so
I thought it could be a cute idea but
I'm also really excited to be doing this
video because it is going to be a collab
with my friend Ashley clay D here on
YouTube and I'm so excited to collab
with her we've been planning for so long
a video to do and when I saw this one
come in I Rose her right away and I was
like what about this one do you want to
do it and she said that she did if you
are not familiar with Ashley's channel
yet of course it is going to be a link
down below and I enjoy her videos and
her personality so much I found her
because she actually did a video of mine
and she put out a tweet and she tagged
me in it you know saying that she had
done one of my video ideas so of course
I went over and watched it and just
immediately felt a friendship with her
and I just absolutely love when that
happens but I really did just feel an
instant connection with her I subscribed
to her right away i watch all of her
videos and I just would highly recommend
her channel I did see recently we were
actually both recommended and Jessica
bronzed
her favorite youtubers under a hundred
thousand which to me was just
mind-boggling
I got so excited when she said Ashley
his name as well and Jessica said the
exact same thing that I think about
Ashley she's just so happy and I leave
watching her videos just in a more
positive place and I've actually
commented that
Ashley's videos before as well I just
love her personality I just love how how
happy and bright she makes things and I
just really do recommend her Channel and
it's so funny since we've been talking
as she mentioned that she lives in the
Midwest and I said back I was like I
knew it I could feel that kinship I knew
that we were both Midwest girls so that
gave me a chuckle but definitely her
channel will be linked down below her
video will be down there make sure to go
check it out and see what she has to say
is on her attacks a refund wish list as
well but if you're ready to see a once
on mine why don't we go ahead and get
started ready of course keep in mind
it's a YouTube video it's not too
serious I know not everybody might get a
tax refund maybe depending on where you
live or you're a certain situation I am
someone who does not always get a tax
refund either so this video is kind of
funny to make because I do not know yet
at this time what's happening with our
taxes we have not heard back yet from
the accountant I am self-employed which
means never have really any idea what's
happening at tax time there are times
where we get a nice refund there's times
where we get a small refund and there's
times where we owe a hell a lot of money
to the IRS there's really not none of
those times or it's like we just oh a
little bit it's always a lot bit yeah oh
it's a lot bit that we owe so yeah we
just had to turn in our taxes not too
long ago and we're still awaiting that
so that's nice and stressful it's one of
those little things about being
self-employed that not everybody knows
the behind-the-scenes of it's that tax
time is incredibly incredibly stressful
so yeah this video is just supposed to
be in good fun of course I saw that
comment and I thought it would pair well
with the idea of talking about mine on
makeup and beauty wishlist me these
items are definitely bigger they're a
little bit more expensive so that's kind
of why they're on that wish list but
then also some of them are more
practical like around the home but that
some of them are more just items that
like I really really want but they're
just more pricey and I just keep going
to get myself to do it so if I was gonna
get a big old tax refund you would be
nice to put them on so of course just
just keep that in mind as we go
throughout the video it's just all in
good fun and thank you to the subscriber
let me know comment below and tell me
who made that suggestion because I
thought it was such a good idea for a
video that I really wanted to do it
thought I would share a few items that I
have on might not make a wish list and
then I have two beauty products as well
to mention because they're expensive
it'll be nice
so have a tax refund to put those
towards okay so the first item and
another reason why I thought it would be
fun to have this called my tax refund
video is because the first item on my
list is a camera and actually two years
ago I bought this a sony a 5100 with our
tax refund money I started a YouTube
channel filming off of my phone I had it
stacked up on books and like a piece of
wood holding my phone to film my videos
and it was definitely really challenging
so obviously I couldn't see myself and
the phone had to be sitting just
precisely and I had to have enough books
and it was kind of a disaster and tax
time came and we got a refund back that
year and I went to my husband and I was
like you know what I really want to try
to make this YouTube thing happen but I
think it'd be a lot easier for me if I
had an actual decent quality camera like
can I use some of our money towards that
so that is when I invested in my first
camera the sony a 5100 that was almost 2
years ago and I really do wanted to get
a better camera this Sony I mean she has
been through so much with me of I film
almost every single day so I feel like
she's a she's kind of nearing the end
sometimes she doesn't want to turn on
sometimes she doesn't want to record
I've had a lot of stressful moments in
the past I would say month or so with
this camera of thinking like oh this is
it she's done and she keeps coming back
she keeps coming back but I think it's
probably a better idea for me to get a
new camera and try to get used to the
changes and everything while this one is
still breathing just in case I can't
quite get it all you know what I'm
saying so I've been taking some time and
doing some research and talking to
people but I have the canon g7x mark ii
camera on my wish list I've seen it for
a few different prices because I see it
on Amazon I see it on Best Buy as well
but it's like seven eight hundred
dollars which is almost double the price
of my Sony so that's definitely an
investment a lot of money to spend on a
camera but obviously a camera is one of
the most important parts of me doing
YouTube and having a channel and all of
that so I've asked a lot of people a lot
of people said that they do have this
Cameron they enjoy it a lot of people
also said a lot of youtubers that they
also have this one on their wish list as
well which I thought was really
interesting so I have that one on my
list and we will see how quickly I'll be
able to upgrade my camera but I just
really want to do it before this one
just refuses to turn on because man
those are it's really stressful when
that happens next up on my list I have a
pair of shoes these are the adidas ultra
boost shoes women's shoes I saw these on
Kendall Alfred snapchat one day if you
are not familiar with Kendall's channel
I really enjoy her channel as well I'll
have it linked down below but she posted
that she bought these shoes and they
were pink and they just looked so cute
and I was like girl what are those shoes
and she wrote back right away and she
sent me a screenshot of them and
everything like of the exact name of the
shoe and everything but there are a
hundred and eighty dollars which I'm not
a big shoe person so that kind of
stresses me out but these are more like
running athletic type of shoes and I
really do need to replace my tennis
shoes that I have because there are
holes in them like on the top part of
the shoe there's a hole in the left foot
so like my toe kind of focus out I mean
like that's not cool right and we are
going on a vacation next month or yeah
next no this month is March oh it's not
March that's terrifying we're going on a
vacation in a couple weeks on Arizona
and we want to do some hiking and we're
going to the Grand Canyon and I don't
have a pair of tennis shoes to bring
with me because mine have holes in them
and so I'm like I should really upgrade
before we go on this vacation and I look
like a but they're $180 I'm gonna
try to find them somewhere for cheaper
they're super cute though I love the way
they look they have good reviews just
180 dollars is pretty expensive
another item like if I had a really nice
tax refund and I'm thinking practicality
wise what is it that I think would be
good to have in my life is a new
mattress I have been wanting both me and
my husband we have been wanting a new
mattress or just a bed upgrade for
weight I feel like we've been talking
about it for probably the past three
years the mattress that we have now is
what I actually bought myself as my
graduation present from college and that
was in 2009
and that mattress that poor thing she's
been through a lot not in a weird way
and like moving wise because I've moved
a lot that mattress has probably lived
in five different locations six
different locations and actually one
time when we were moving from one place
to another it actually flew off Mitch's
truck and tumbled them to the street
luckily there was no cars behind us
somehow cuz we were on a busy road
there's no cars behind us no one got
hurt except the mattress she's all
scuffed up on one side but I just an
upgrade would really be helpful we have
a queen now and we would love a king
because we have a villa or our dog Ares
as a villa and she sleeps in our bed
with us in between us under the covers
and we would also really love to get a
second dog at some point but we would
get a villa who was a Velcro villa they
always want to be by their owners so
like they don't sleep they don't sleep
on their dog bed they don't sleep on the
floor they sleep by us she has to be
touching both of us at all times it's
ridiculous but if we got a second one
it's like where where would we go in the
Queen like the three of us barely fit as
it is there's areas it's 55 pounds okay
she doesn't 55 pound lap dog so we would
really love to just get a better quality
mattress get a bigger mattress and all
of that but they're so expensive we've
been looking at all these different
mattress places if you have a really
good mattress that you love or you would
absolutely recommend let me know because
I would love to know one item that is
it's a kind of beauty related but this
is been on my wish list since I was like
I don't know 13 years old I've always
wanted a nice vanity just a nice vanity
a desk a chair a mirror maybe some
lights on it I've always wanted that
since I was a young girl and even when
we moved into this house I didn't have a
youtube channel when we moved into this
house and it had an extra bedroom and I
was like oh it would be so nice if I
could have like a vanity over here and I
could have my own little chair and my
mirror and this could be like my spot to
get ready like I've always wanted that
for the longest time behind me I just
have a desk it's like an older desk that
we've like repainted and stuff to try to
make it look nicer and all of that but
I've always dreamed of having like just
a really nice vanity with a really nice
mirror that's been
my wish list for a really long time
we're not that even not even though
having a YouTube channel like everybody
it seems has a vanity I still don't know
if I will like ever have one I just
don't know if it's like one of those
things that you've wanted for so long
I've just kind of like come to the
conclusion that I'm not gonna have it
and I gotta get over it another item on
our tax refund wishlist and this this
might be the thing that we actually
really do buy if we do end up getting a
refund for taxes is a dishwasher our
dishwasher has been broken for I don't
know a handful of months now which is
which is quite a bummer and no for a
dishwasher not everybody has one and all
that but uh we have had a dishwasher in
this house so I've been used to a
dishwasher for you know almost five
years now so not having it I'm like ah I
did it so tired doing the dishes and
then I I take my wedding ring off and I
do the dishes and then sometimes I
forget to put it back on and it'll be
like an hour later and I'm typing and
I'm like oh I got my ring let's go
where's my ring where did I put my ring
and then I freaked out would really like
to have a dishwasher and we might have
like a move coming up in the future so
I'm pretty sure someone's not gonna buy
our house with a broken dishwasher like
we would need to replace that or you
know do something about that but I would
really like my dishwasher back the final
item that I have on my list that's not
beauty related is I've wanted a new
canvas print for our bedroom for the
longest time we have two in our bedroom
right now one is one of our engagement
photos and then we have a wedding photo
as well I'm not sure the sizing on them
I would have to double-check but I think
they're like a sixteen by twenty and I
believe I got both of them on Shutterfly
and a 16 by 20 on Shutterfly is about
$70 or so though typically I can find
some sort of deal or discount list
Shutterfly I usually find something
there but I've wanted to have one of our
family photos because we don't have a
photo with areas up there and I think
it'd be really nice to kind of like
round it all out you know you get the
engagement you got the marriage and then
you got you know our child our doggies
but we took our Christmas photo as a
couple years ago I think it was the
first Christmas photo we took with Aries
and it's just one of my absolute
favorite family photos of us and I would
really love to have that on a big old
canvas print and
that one up in our bedroom I think that
that would look really cool so I really
want to get that it's it's hard it's
hard to spend that much money especially
when it's something that is just going
to be enjoyed by me me and Mitch like no
one else is you know really in our
bedroom no one else really sees that so
it's kind of hard to spend 70 bucks on
that but I really do want that's been on
that's been on my wish list for a very
long time so someday soon I might have
that in the bedroom
and like I said I only have two items on
there that are like makeup beauty the
first one is a busy heart I shadow
palette these are just so expensive I've
wanted this particular 12 pan busy heart
palette for the longest time but it's
$80 and I just struggle so much to just
shell out $80 for an eyeshadow palette
but you know if my tax refund is just
completely just you know the craziest
tax refund I've ever seen in my life and
I can buy all these practical items and
have some money synced over for makeup
you know that's not how it goes but if I
had some extra money I would love to
purchase a Vizio I should appellate I
really want the warm neutrals matte
palette I believe it what it is what
it's called it's an all matte palette
it's the warm tones neutral tones I mean
it's me and i swatched it in my Sephora
once and it's watched so beautifully and
I hear so many good things about the
visi art 12 pan palettes that I really
really want this one I just need to get
over that $80 price tag but that's
definitely on my tax refund wish list
the last beauty item that I have on here
in the last item on my tax refund wish
list is from Charlotte Tilbury so you
know that Sun's up but it's our flawless
finish
face powder which is $45 I mentioned
this one recently in my two hundred
dollar gift card video where I was
comparing high-end makeup to drugstore
makeup and I mentioned this one in that
video and a lot of people wrote in
saying that they really enjoyed that
powder that would recommend the powder
it's worth the price and all of that so
all those comments got me thinking even
more like dang it I really would like
that Charlotte Tilbury powder I've been
really into kind of like a finishing
powder on my face lately which hasn't
always been that way in the past but I
find myself reaching for them more than
more and I just hear really good things
about this one from Charlotte Tilbury
but again it's $45 the brand is
expensive overall but yes that one it
would definitely be on my wish list as
well but after that Charlotte Tilbury
product that is going to be
that is on my tax refund wishlist hey
guys so I'm actually filming this after
all the following day because I realized
that I forgot to film it when I sat down

practical items and if we actually do
get a tax refund because I still know
idea if we actually do get one hopefully

purchases that is on our tax refund wish
list because some not only are just for
