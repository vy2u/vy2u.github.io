today's video is going to be all about
my top a favorite face palette this
video has been requested for so long so
I am so excited to finally share all of
my favorite face palettes I have both
affordable and high-end in here so if
you want to see some of my favorite face
of palettes why don't I go ahead and get
started so like I said this videos been
requested for so long so thank you to
everyone who's been so excited about
seeing this video I'm a huge face
palette lover so I'm really excited to
share some of my favorites here I will
say that I wanted to do like my top 10
favorite face palettes or something like
that and I believe I pulled out all of
my favorites and I had 12 of them and I
stared really hard and I was like take
away two and I just couldn't so I think
I'm pretty sure it's 12 that we have to
chat about so I'm just gonna call this
my top favorite face palettes because I
I couldn't narrow it down jump into some
affordable ones this one here is from
ELF and this is a face duo the one I
pulled out here is Saint Lucia and they
also have their formula of this one it's
called their aqua face duos or what not
I have one of those as well but I really
prefer these like kind of straight
powder ones and I feel like they last a
little bit longer the ones that are the
aqua formula I felt like it kind of went
bad fairly quickly but this one is in
st. Lucia so it's a really nice compact
you get a great mirror here and then you
have a bronzer and you can either use
this as like a highlight or really kind
of light almost kind of peachy blush I
use it for both myself highlight and
blush but I really enjoyed the bronzer
in here this one in Saint Lucia I think
would definitely be better for a lighter
skin tone but they do have other options
as well and these are only four dollars
four dollars for these I mean that is so
affordable and especially once you get a
mirror in it I'm just like yeah these
are fantastic I would love to have more
of them like I said I have two one from
the aqua collection as well but I would
really really recommend these another
palette that I absolutely love and I
have repurchased is from Wet n Wild and
this is their mega Glo contouring a
palette I bought one of these from I
think was like CVS there are about five
dollars I believe it is and it actually
broke on me when I was traveling one
time I must have dropped my bag too
heavily or something but it broke and I
was so devastated I went right back out
like I mean literally like within like
three days and bought me a new one
because I was like no this has to be my
collection luckily it is only five
dollars so it's a bad price at all too
replace them and I get mine in dulce de
leche I believe they have one other
shade as well but this is a really
wonderful setting powder and it's kind
of a brightening powder I do like to
have brighter on your eyes most of the
time so I really enjoy this powder this
is also a really really nice contour or
bronzer shade
I really enjoyed both of these you get
really nice pan sizes and again for five
dollars I just I always want this in my
collection next time I have a palette
that unfortunately is broken and I will
be I will be getting a new one of these
this is from a flower beauty and this is
called their lift and sculpt contouring
palette and I have mine and the shades
medium to deep so inside you do get a
bronzer which has shattered a blush and
then a highlight so I can't open it
because it is shattered and I can't use
even though only the bronzer shattered
it's still like affecting the blush and
the highlight so I do just need to go
ahead and declutter this but I wanted to
save it for this video and then I do
want to repurchase a new one I'm really
excited because flower beauty is coming
into Ulta I feel like I've been waiting
for this day I recommend so much from
flower beauty I really enjoy a lot from
that brand so when I saw the
announcement that they're coming in to
Alta I was like yes I'm not sure what
all products will be going into Aalto
but I sincerely hope that this one is
included because I will be repurchasing
this one the bronzer is beautiful at the
blush is gorgeous and the highlight is
the stand out from this palette is a
beautiful gold highlight and I
absolutely loved it I believe this is
$14 so we're getting a little bit higher
than the elf and the wet wild but it is
still a gorgeous palette and yeah if you
haven't seen that flower beauty's coming
yet I can't think of the exact they'd
off the top of my head but it's coming
soon and I am really excited because
otherwise you can just find these at
Walmart or flower Beauty online so so
happy about that and then last up for my
affordable face palettes of that I love
this one is from a pixie beauty and it's
in collaboration with Miriam and YC I
really enjoy this palette and I've
talked about it quite a bit I believe it
was mentioned in my 2016 best the beauty
video but inside you do get a six
different shades and you get an array of
colors I use these too as a bronzer
shades neither one is
test a contour shade for me but I'll
kind of go back and forth depending on
typically the season or if I'm self tan
I'll use one of those as a bronzer but
all of these highlights are really
really nice especially this gold
highlight it is stunning so I really
enjoyed this palette it is $20 pixie
Beauty is still considered affordable
but they're like on the higher end of
affordable so it is $20 but if you can
find it at Target for like a discount or
using your red card or something like
that you can save a little bit but I do
highly recommend these there are two
pallets of these and this one is the
glow and bronze of palette from pixie in
the Merriam NYC collab okay so moving
along I do have a palette here that is
no longer available that I could find
online but it's still one of my absolute
favorites so I did want to mention it in
case maybe you ever see it I like a
colles or you know two dramatics or
anything like that but this is from
lorac and it's the collaboration with
Beauty and the Beast so you get three
different blushes in here an occult
eyelet you also do have a mirror and I
love this I take this traveling with me
so often I think all of the blushes are
super super beautiful and again that
gold highlight is stunning I enjoyed
that mirror in here I will say that I
also really enjoy the face palette from
the lorac and Pirates of the Caribbean
collection I like this one even more and
since they're both limited edition and
basically like impossible to find right
now I thought I would just mention this
one as my absolute fave but I know some
people are saying they're finding the
Pirates of the Caribbean collection
still available at like in Col stores or
at t.j.maxx or Nordstrom Rack or
something like that so if you see it
especially if it's a discounted price
and you see the face palette one of my
favorites this one is kind of random and
something that I don't think I expected
to love as much as I did but when I was
pulling out all of my favorite face
palettes this was one of the first ones
that I reached for I was like you know I
absolutely love this one this one is
from Tarte it's the TARDIS contour
volume 3 palette so it looks like this
and then inside you do get a mirror and
then a variety of different shades here
I typically use this one as a contour
shade and this one as a bronzer I love
the blush in here and both the
highlights are absolutely gorgeous the
shade is not only one that's a little
bit too dark for me that I really can't
use but otherwise this is a awesome
palette and again I take this traveling
with me so much because I love having
all of the different shades in here that
I need
it's easy to travel what like it's kind
of bigger but it's still compact at the
same time you have the mirror this
highlight especially I do think is
really really gorgeous I reach for this
one even over at that one but I love the
blush in here as well it's a nice and
neutral kind of pink blush reminds me a
little bit of part a from Tarte
cosmetics and I love having the bronzer
and contour so this is a big favorite I
did a lot of traveling this summer and I
took this one quite a bit with me this
one is available on the Tarte website
and it's pretty heavily discounted I
want to say I saw it for like $27 and
it's normally like 45 so I will link
this one to the Tarte website down below
in case you were interested in picking
it up because it is on sale right now
and then the other palette that I this
was this was with me every single time I
left my house this summer practically
and you shouldn't be surprised if you
followed my channel this is from a pure
cosmetics and this one is the gold
digger palette it's called their vanity
palette and I really enjoyed this
because you do get some eyeshadows over
here but truly I love this as a face
palette because this bronzer this blush
and this highlight are they are key and
I love them I also love the packaging of
this one that you can pop it up and make
it into a vanity that's why it's called
the vanity palette it was so so handy to
have when we were like we were busy be
it's this summer we were constantly gone
and this was so nice to throw in my bag
again like really easy to travel with I
mean the mirror the vanity and these
faces shades that I love so much this
highlight is especially really really
gorgeous I did just mention these in my
underrated makeup video and I know a lot
of people said you went over to the
Pierre website to buy them and it looks
like they are being like really
discounted in price so I think they're
going to be discontinued fairly soon
they used to be on the Ulta website and
they're not any longer so if you want to
get these I would highly recommend them
and I did notice that this one in
particular the gold digger is discounted
on that the pur cosmetics website as
well they're normally $36 and I think
this one is on sale right now for 25 so
this looks like something you'd be
interested I highly recommend getting it
for even a discount I think that's
freaking awesome but I mean you guys
knew that I was gonna mention that
palette and I want to talk about is the
one that I guess is is gone now it's
being discontinued or it is discontinued
I'm not really sure what's going on here
but
this is the tart clay play one palette
and I'm I feel like me and a lot of
other people are very upset that this
one was suddenly just swept under the
rug like just just gone I think it's no
longer available on all our Sephora I
don't think it's available on the Tarte
website anymore they recently came out
with the clay play - if you haven't seen
my video yet I did an alcohol and Tryon
video and I use the clay play - in there
and I gave you a lot of my thoughts on
this but the original clay play palette
is the freakin bomb and I'm really upset
that it has been discontinued because it
truly is an amazing palette I mean this
one is an eyeshadow palette as well but
I really enjoy it for these face shades
also this I use as my contour and this I
use as my bronzer and I highly enjoy
this palette I did want to mention that
I do feel like it's more eyeshadow
palette versus face palette but I reach
for this so often for those contour and
bronzer shades but I still wanted to
mention it as a face palette but I'm
just really disappointed that it's been
discontinued I felt like a lot of people
really enjoyed this palette I don't
understand what Tarte was doing or
thinking what the clay played - very
confusing but like I said I do go more
in depth in a different video about us
all have it linked down below but I love
this palette for some reason you can
find it anywhere or you see it somewhere
I highly recommend it the shades were
really nice and pigmented but very easy
to blend at the same time this went
traveling with me all summer long as
well I loved the big mirror that I got
it was just something that I could pull
out and easily create any sort of look
with so that one really bums me out but
I felt like I still want to mention it
because it truly is a favorite face
palette of mine and then next up we have
one I believe this one is limited
edition as well because it was a holiday
release but this is from Becca cosmetics
it's the appraise key below a face
palette I absolutely adore this palette
I've mentioned it in favourites videos I
mentioned it and makeup I don't regret
buying and all of that but truly one of
my favorite face palettes and I get use
out of every single shade in here a lot
of times with face pallets especially
when there's you know more than two or
three shades it's just kind of
impossible to get a use for every single
shape there's going to be that woman or
maybe that - and I just don't work for
you
don't work for your skin tone you don't
love it maybe it's not as good as the
other shades etc all of these shades in
here are phenomenal and I can use all of
them in different ways I love the
highlights in here I love layering the
highlights in here I love the blush I'm
so shocked I've not hit pan on that
bronzer because it's called the Bondi
bronzer I believe are the bronze Bondi
bronzer there we go so the rose quartz
highlight in here this one right here
and one of my favorites sorry the
packaging is so reflective it's hard but
I love this palette again goes traveling
with me all the time I love that I can
get a use out of every single shade in
here and I just think it is the bomb $54
but I've seen it on sale quite a bit
recently so if you can't get it on sale
I'd recommend it but I still think it's
worth the $54 honestly my opinion at
least to me it was worth that price tag
and stuff my favorite the final three I
have this one is a bit newer to me but I
reach for this consistently and I
believe it was mentioned in maybe like
my November makeup monthly in the
favorites section this is also from
Pierre and this is the contour Diaries
and I really like it you do have a
mirror and then you have these different
to face shades inside the three that I
use the most are charm which I use it
for underneath the eyes secret I use as
my contour shade and then passion I use
as my bronzer shade and I reach for this
all of the time it's really easy to take
traveling with me as well and I just
think that they're really nice pigmented
blendable you know all of that good
stuff that we look for in a face palette
so I really do enjoyed this one I
believe it is $32 on at the Pierre
website so would highly recommend that
one and then the last two are pretty
like high-end products this one is from
Marc Jacobs and I have to say I did not
expect to love this palette as much as I
did I feel like so many Marc Jacobs
products I'm like yeah maybe I'll like
it and then I end up falling in love it
has happened with me so many times with
Marc Jacobs this is called the high
filter palette it says hashtag instant
mark and it says this is number 60 my
friend Candice did send this to me and I
was so excited when I got it because I
had I these I heard people talking about
them a lot of people compare these and
the wet-and-wild
palette that I mentioned a little bit
earlier or not they're similar and
packaging and all of that but the price
tag is very different where the
wet-and-wild is five dollars this one I
believe is 49 so big difference there
you do get a nice a big
with this one and I will say that I
enjoy the bronzer and I thought that I
was going to I really love bronzer I
love contour I love all of that so I was
like yes I'm going to love this bronzer
but I actually enjoy the setting powder
even more it's a very interesting color
because it's not super light but it's
also not really yellow which I don't
like a ton of yellow on my under eyes
it's just this kind of like in-between
color that works really well for me but
how it says it's thief what's a filter
hive hi-5 filter
I truly believe but that is what my
under eyes look like when I put this
powder on it just kind of smooths
everything away it almost like a lifts
the under eye area I mean it looks so
good I can pair this with really any of
my concealers and I know that my under
eye area is going to look so good so
really this palette has me sold for this
half but again you are getting a really
nice bronzer over here as well I believe
they have different shades in these
palettes as well but I said this $49 but
I mean I'm telling you did not expect to
fall in love with it I believe this was
also mentioned in a favorites video
because dang it's really good and then
the last one I have is from Kevin of
Quon who is definitely you know high-end
a luxury price tag but there's for this
all the time I'm always talking about
this palette and this is the Kevin Kwan
it is called the contour book vol 2 the
art of sculpting and and defining so
inside you do get a mirror and it's kind
of interesting too because when you
first open it up I can get there
it actually has like a little like a
diagram for you like maybe if you're a
newbie or you're not exactly sure where
everything goes it kind of has like a
face shirt here in an eye chart here and
it'll it'll spell it out for you which I
thought was pretty cool and then inside
you do get a mirror but you get a cream
contour and then you also get the
sculpting powder which the sculpting
powder is a lot of people's holy grails
including myself
I love the sculpting powder so far
pretty much it's crazy and then you get
a cream highlight a powder highlight and
then you do get eyeshades as well so
this is really kind of one of those
complete palettes that I enjoy so much
the star of the show to me is definitely
the sculpting powder to by the sculpting
powder by itself I want to say is like
$49 or something like that so I think
it's really cool that first
five dollars you get the sculpting
pottery you also get a cream contour you
get two different highlight shades and
then you can also create you know a nice
kind of neutral eye look as well in this
palette I just reach for it so often
again the sculpting powder is like the
number one for me so you know maybe if
you just want to try the sculpting
powder you could purchase that one
separately but I think the book is also
a really good value I know sixty-five
dollars is like a high price tag when I
say 65 but when you think of everything
that you're kind of getting in here I
feel like it is a really good value and
Kevin ikonn is one of those brands as
well that has so many products that I
just instantly fall for and I'm just
like these are great qualities so I did
want to mention this one it truly is
just one of my favorites I'm using it
all the time I feel like I'm
consistently tagging Kevin O Kwan
sculpting powder on my Instagram so I
really do enjoy that one but after that
that is going to be it for my top
favorite face palettes okay so that is
everything for my favorite base palettes
I really hope that you enjoyed this
