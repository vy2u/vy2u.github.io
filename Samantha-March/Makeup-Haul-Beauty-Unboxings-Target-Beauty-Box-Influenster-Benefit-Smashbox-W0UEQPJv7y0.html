today's video I'm going to be doing
another makeup beauty haul I know I feel
like I just did a really large one but
I've gotten a couple of PR packages that
I am so beyond excited to share with you
guys i have a new influenster box i
actually like one something in a
giveaway it and i wanted to share that
with you guys cuz again I'm gonna have a
lot of different products to share with
you guys so let's jump into it so first
I'm going to share a few items that I
picked up for myself and it was during
it all to run so at first I picked up
another Real Techniques Beauty sponge so
my one that I have is just like it's
getting to the point of no return so I'm
going to throw that away pretty soon but
picked another one up with these i also
received a sample of the new benefit
cosmetics goof proof brow pencil which
looks like this so i do have a whole
video where I do my first impression and
a demo of the pencil so if you guys want
to see that I can link it below but I
have been trying it more and i am really
liking it so was Aires she wanted to let
you know she's here but i am really
really liking it and i'm excited cuz i'm
actually been like doing my brows of
course i didn't do them today because
i'm super rushed to film this video
because i'm losing the daylight but
really good the last thing I picked up
is one that I've been searching like
everywhere for its from NYX Cosmetics
and it's their sculpt and highlight face
duo so it looks like this I wasn't sure
what shade to get I ordered online I
ended up getting almond light but
basically it's just a like double ended
product and on one side you have your
contour and on the other side you have
the highlight I have not used it yet
because I was trying to decide if I
should do like a first impression video
would you guys want to see like a first
impression demo using this I would be
happy to do it so let me know if you
guys want to see that so i was pretty
excited i saw a gal her name is
Jacqueline baker and i think i saw an
Instagram that she said I'm having like
a skincare giveaway on my blog if you
want to enter I was like I like skin
care i'll enter and then she you help me
and said I want and I was like what I
never win anything how cool is that and
so I got to pick out there's a three
products and you could pick the one that
you wanted the most and this was the one
that she talked about
so I decided to go with it but it is
from Fox prim and it is a vitamin C
lotion so there's the Fox brand logo
right there but I'm really curious
because I love vitamin C I have so many
different vitamin C serums if you guys
watch any of my skincare videos I'm
always talking about using vitamin C and
so this is basically like a vitamin C
moisturizer and I am so excited to give
this a try vitamin C is just for your
skin so then I was pretty excited
because I got a new box from Influenster
this is called the blush box box if you
guys aren't familiar with influenster
yet get on that website and get taking
surveys and trying to get these Fox
boxes basically you will get sent
products in exchange for reviews and
talking about them on social media it's
such an amazing service I get so excited
every time I get an email to take a
survey and every time I get the notice
that hey you're getting a box box I'm
freaking pumped but it was so cool
because this one is called the blush box
box and it's basically like wedding
themed and that's so exciting because I
actually just got asked to be a
bridesmaid and my friend Shannon
swimming she's getting married next May
I'm so excited I just did a bridesmaid
makeup tutorial and I got this blush box
box i'm like i'm getting ready to give
my bridesmaid Zilla on okay so inside
each box box that you get you get like a
little card and then it also says all
the products that on you here and that
lists how much they are they also have
like the social-media handles and a
hashtag for each different item you get
you guys aren't with influenced or yet i
will leave a link in the description box
below make sure you get signed up it's
free it's easy you don't have to be a
blogger or blogger you can just be
someone who likes to talk on social
media and you can get these boxes it's
fantastic but diving in to this one so
we got from simple makeup the micellar
makeup remover wipes so the micellar is
very very popular right now you know the
micellar water is out there the makeup
remover so when I saw my seller makeup
remover wipes that was like okay I am
into this really really excited to try
these so also in there we got some hair
care we got from Pantene it's their
intense hydration shamp
whoo &amp;amp; conditioner so we got like a
deluxe sample set of bees which I am
very excited to try I have so much
shampoo and conditioner because I get
sent it so much but thank you so much
this is another product that I think I
have been sent in my last like three
influenster boxes and I'm like is
someone trying to say something because
hmm but this is from secret if their
clinical strength ooh la la lavender
scent clear gel deodorant so packaging
looks like this but I keep getting sent
deodorant I'm like what are you guys
trying to tell me you're trying to tell
me something hmm shade no but this is
what the packaging looks like for the
clear gel deodorant now I don't use
clear clear gel a whole lot I typically
use like the regular antiperspirant but
I will definitely be trying out the
clear gel and these sizes are so perfect
to throw in like a clutch your purse
your beach bag excellent we also did get
a card in here from perfect details and
it is for fifteen percent off any bridal
accessories at perfect details calm so
they got that on a little card as well
which is pretty cool especially because
it might need some accessories coming up
the last thing in there is a set of
eyelashes mmm you guys know how much I
love eyelashes but these are from our
dell they are the natural lashes this
would be perfect for a bride or even a
bridesmaid look where yes you want to
put eyelashes on but you don't want to
be like too over-the-top or two like in
your face I think these will be really
good I'm really really excited to try
these ok so that was everything that I
received in the influenster blush voxbox
again I will leave the links below to
influenster but now let's move on to the
target beauty box okay you guys a little
background on the target beauty box I
believe they send these out like four
times a year I want to say it's like a
seasonal thing I don't think it's a
monthly thing but you guys can correct
me if I'm wrong and at least it used to
be seasonal from what I have been
hearing if it's changed you know you
guys something that my comments below
but this guy is ten dollars on the
target website if you have your red card
it's a little bit cheaper and you get
four
shipping which is always nice but the
hard thing about this is that it's not a
subscription like if C or birchbox or
things like that where you sign up and
you just automatically get one a
reporter you have to go on like when
they come for sale you have to go on the
website and purchase it and they sell
out in like a day they sell out so fast
every single time that I've seen on
social media that these are for sale
I've immediately gone to the target
website and it's already gone and I'm
like dang it because they look like
amazing boxes and I just happened to be
on Twitter on the right time I saw
someone say something I went to the
target website it was still there and I
bought it then the actual box came and
I'm nearly fell over when I opened this
is if you guys can see it is just like
jam-packed that's only like the top
layer there's another layer underneath
all of this it was jam-packed with
goodies I nearly died I was so excited
so why don't we go through everything in
here so this was kind of funny to me
because I was actually a repeat from my
influenster box but it is from Pantene
it's the intense hydration shampoo so I
got the shampoo and conditioner in the
influenster box and then a little bit
bigger size I think of the shampoo in
the target box from l'oreal we got their
revitalift volume filler day cream I am
really excited to try this no lie and it
looks like a pretty good size of it too
so yes from ELF we got the lip kiss bomb
I'm always looking for good lip balms
just to be able to throw my purse just
when I need a little hydration on my
lips so really excited for this from
Shea Moisture I think it is it's the few
fruit fusion coconut water weightless
creme rinse it looks like this this is
also a really good size product like I
can't imagine going through this very
fast but it says it's good for
lightweight hydration so I will
definitely be trying that out from coats
maybe it says the healthier sunscreen
it's a sunscreen for your face SPF 40 a
little guy of this this will be perfect
again to throw like in the beach bag and
the clutch when you're going to be
outside all day do not forget yourself
this from SW basics of Brooklyn it says
it is a sea salt exfoliant so the one
side looks like this and then when you
turn it around you can actually like see
the product in here and it says when you
need a super deep clean what a small
amount rub gently onto face and rinse
off so that's an exfoliant and then we
got more face wipes which I'm like yes
hallelujah love face lives thank you so
much it is the yes to cucumbers soothing
hypoallergenic facial wipes so that's
what these look like very excited for
these from soap &amp;amp; Glory we got a sample
of the look better naked the righteous
body butter so I have not tried anything
from soap and glory but I hear about it
all the time so I was really excited to
get something from them oh my god
keeping it real like can you see how big
this boxes it's so crazy 10 bucks for
all of this from laneige this is a water
Bank serum so that sounds amazing and
sounds like something that I want to put
all over my face I'm a pixi by petra
this is a mesmerizing mineral duo in
apricot glow looks like this I do not
have anything yet from this pixi by
petra line but i'm starting to hear more
about it so now i get to try it out I
thought this was pretty cool we got a
sample of the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
cushion foundation so I think this is
like the like little pad that you used
to rub it in and then this is a sample
of the foundation which is really cool
it also comes with the coupon for two
dollars off any l'oreal paris True Match
cosmetics at target which I will
definitely be using that but the true
Match Lumi cushion is one of my favorite
foundations I'm actually almost out of
it so I'm really appreciative for this
coupon because it's expensive for the
drug store so i will be using that
coupon plus my red card when i buy a new
one and then i also thought it was
really interesting because it comes with
like this little card in the box and it
kind of goes over each thing that is in
the box explaining what it is but then
it also comes with a three dollar off
coupon a beauty purchase of fifteen
dollars or more so you get a little
coupon here on the Bob
on the bottom so that's three dollars
off obviously i will be using that
coupon but the box was ten dollars
subtract the three dollar coupon of
seven dollars technically six because
you get a dollar off for using your red
card and free shipping like that was a
really amazing if you guys can get your
hands on the target beauty box I
definitely suggest you do it if you
don't follow me on snapchat I will leave
my snapchat below it's just Samantha DAP
March but as soon as I saw that the
target beauty box was for sale I
immediately after I bought it what and
told you guys that it was on sale so
it's awesome so I have two more boxes to
show you in these boxes like whoa made
me go a little crazy again if you follow
me on snapchat you'll have already have
seen these but it was so wild and so
excited to share them with you first i
received a PR package from Benefit
Cosmetics and I start crying of course
because it's just so crazy so far I've
gotten a PR package from sigma beauty
when I became an affiliate forum and
they you know sent along some makeup and
brushes and stuff so we can talk about
it when we are sharing llegar codes in
our links and things like that the
benefit is the first brand just to like
send me things just because they wanted
to send me things and they hope I like
review them and talk about them and oh
man I was so excited and the first thing
that was in here that I saw and I like
nearly died over was the roller lash
mascara oh my goodness I am so excited I
hear so many good things about it and
usually when I'm gonna haul things I
wait to use them just because I want
them to like look clean I don't want to
forget about I mean I don't want to put
them away in storage and then forget
about him but this is one product that i
just had to start using like right away
so this is what the packaging looks like
it's gorgeous and I love this mascara I
feel like everybody talks about it and
everybody loves it and it is for such a
good reason it is such a good mascara I
really like how it gives your lashes
like a little bit of a curl to them I
thought that was really really amazing
and it just makes your lashes look so
good it looks like your natural lash but
even better like I
say that it makes you look like you're
wearing false lashes but it still makes
your lashes look so good and I was so
happy to try this I think that they sent
along was they're real push-up liner so
it looks like this i believe the color
they sent is in black but I'm also
really excited for this because I've
heard a lot about it and I can never
have enough eyeliner I swear eyeliner is
one thing that I just I absolutely love
I never want to run out of eyeliner ever
oh this is really cool packaging okay so
this is what the packaging looks like
that looks really neat and then this is
what the product looks like like that is
like sharp I bet you could create a
really sweet wing with that ooh I'm
excited to try this I will be trying
this very soon and then another thing
that they sent along is the dandelion
face product so on the back it says it's
a ballerina pink face powder you can use
it as a soft blush earn all over or all
over the face as a brightening finishing
powder which I thought was really really
interesting so I haven't tried it yet
but it does come with the brush that a
lot of benefit products do come with
this and then this is what the blush
looks like it's kind of cool cuz it has
a little mirror too and that's what it
looks like it looks so soft and so
pretty I kind of want to try it both
ways like as a blush but then also as
like the lumen ating powder like look I
should I have this for my all of our
highlighter challenge am i right so
excited I hear so many people talk about
the dandelion so I am excited to give it
a try thank you so much to benefit for
sending me these really amazing products
like it it blew my mind it made me feel
so special I'm just so appreciative
still thankful I can't wait to try out
the other products and just so happy
hopefully you guys couldn't hear the
baseball in the background i realized
that i forgot to mute the TV I'm
watching the cubs game so so I just ran
and muted that hopefully you guys
weren't too distracted by that but then
my last thing to share with you guys is
that I also got a PR package from
Smashbox and you oh man like I I was
just blown away it just is it's amazing
it's incredible to see just you know a
small idea that someone
has you know oh hey yeah I'm an author I
write books but I'm going to jump on
YouTube but I'm going to film myself
talking about makeup and beauty because
I just absolutely love it I love doing
makeup I love talking about makeup I
love reviewing products that's it's
something that I absolutely love and
have such a huge passion in and so I
thought why not why can't I do it you
know I would see other people doing it
and having so much fun with it and I
just thought well I can do that too
right and I started filming off my phone
and having no editing not even know how
you like to trim videos and all the
times i would say um or reach for
product I didn't in the beginning I had
no idea how to even edit it for that and
just to see in a year's time where we've
come and I've got a remote camera now
and I actually paid for editing software
and learned how to use it and now I'm
getting packages from companies that I
have been buying from and you know using
and recommending their products for so
many years before i was on youtube
before I even knew what youtube was and
now they're sending me boxes I'm like
this is incredible and so thankful but
let's look at what smashbox sent along
so i thought these were really cool and
they sent over three of these blush and
highlight pallets so they look like this
like i said they sent along three of
them so we have Pacific Coast pink which
looks like this so that's Pacific Coast
pink and then we also have over city
coral which looks like that and then the
last one that was sent over is a Malibu
berry and looks like that so honestly it
says these are blush and highlight I
could see some of these shades being
used as I shadows you know just kind of
like mixing it up though I thought this
was so cool and the other thing that was
in the box is there photo/matt eyes
palette it looks like this now I have
seen a little bit going on about this
palette and I think it's really cool
because it's supposed to be used as it
says it up here a shadow liner and also
brow powder so you're supposed to be
able to be able to use all these matte
shadows ask those different things it
also comes with a brush in here and
let's just open it up because I haven't
even opened this yet but I'm so excited
but this looks like a
legit palette like as I owe me an I
nearly fell off my chair when I saw this
but ooh look at this okay so that's what
the packaging looks like and then when
you open it up a really nice mirror up
here so it does have a really nice
mirror and then here's what all the
shades look like I took the brush out
because you know it was going to fall
but there is a double ended brush okay
so one looks like one side would be for
shadow and the other side would be for
like liner or brow so that is really
cool but wow this palette looks nice so
these are all matte shades and can be
used as shadows liners and bra powders
that is so cool like this packaging is
nice like a king can offer that oh my
gosh that is so cool and it comes with a
brush and wow I'm excited you'll be
seeing me use this in an upcoming
tutorial I'm going to play around with
it a little bit and see what kind of
look I want to come up with it but oh
man i'm excited i'm still thankful thank
