today's video is going to be another
video of makeup that I do not regret now
buying I have done one other video like
this in the past so I will leave that
link down below but basically I'm just
going over myself that I decided not to
purchase and I think not have any
regrets over that so I will take you
through a couple of these items and I
wanted to let you know again just like
with my last video I am still recovering
from a wisdom tooth extraction and my
voice is still not completely back to
normal because I still cannot totally
like unlock my job if that makes sense
and my tongue is still numb the right
side of my tongue is still numb it's
been almost a week since my procedure
and it's been a very long week but I
feel like I'm getting a little bit
better so I wanted to sit down and film
again and put makeup on and just like
feel like a real person I'm not used to
being down for the count for so long so
it's very frustrating week but I wanted
to get back into it and I thought why
not film one of my favorite videos that
I've done in the past and a video that
again has been really requested by you
guys I will also leave my other videos
and like my regret series I might start
a playlist because I have makeup that I
regret not buying I think I better
regret buying makeup that I regret not
buying that sort of thing so I'll leave
those videos let's down below let me
know if you do want me to make a
playlist of them but why don't we go
ahead and jump into a makeup that I
don't regret now buying so the first
items that I have are in a collection
from Too Faced it was their sweet peach
collection so Too Faced came out the
sweet peach palette what like two years
ago almost maybe I have that palette and
I love it I definitely don't regret
buying that it really is one of my
favorite palettes and then they decided
to come out with an entire collection I
did a I think I did a full will I buy it
on that collection and I set that up in
the pass over everything and I truly
have no regrets about it
so it came with a blush the blush is
really the one thing that I feel like I
hear really good things about but not
enough for me to be like oh no I missed
out on the peach blush I have a peach
blush on today I have a lot of peach
polishes like I didn't feel like I was
missing out there was also the
highlighting palette of course
you guys know that I'm like in a highly
buying frenzy the last couple of months
when aiwei's been coming out highlight
pallets but even back then when the
collection did release I think I was
actually like off the highlight train if
I'm remembering correctly like I just
wasn't really into highlighting anymore
I wasn't doing it a lot I have come back
on the train I am highlighting a lot I'm
really into it right now
but I do not hear very good things about
the highlight palette at all so I'm
super glad that I skipped over that and
I had a couple of the peach oils the lip
oils I got mine at my friend Lisa did
send me one in a box of goodies that she
sent for me so I have one but I have not
traded out yet and I'm really interested
too because I actually do hear good
things about these but I'm excited to be
able to trim it up for myself and see
what I think about it and see if it
works for me so I will be trying that
one out shortly hopefully soon it is a
challenging to put lipstick on these
days and rub my lips together when you
can't really move your job completely
but I do have one I will be trying it
out very soon but as a whole again I
feel like I hear good things about them
but I also don't hear a lot of people
wearing them I don't see a lot of photos
of people wearing them and that sort of
thing so much hmm I just don't think I
missed out on collection which I also
thought was very expensive even the
peach palette like I said that I love
and I do on it was $49 and that's very
expensive I think in my opinion for an
eyeshadow palette still a really good
one because the rest of the collection I
felt was overpriced as well and I just
do not regret not buying this one so
another one that I don't regret not
buying is a newer release it's the
nikkietutorials and over cosmetics
collab now there's a couple reasons so
they don't regret not buying this
hey I said my lily-white video I don't
really have a lot from ultra haven't
really tested a lot out from them and
all eyes do like nikkietutorials
i watch her videos I think she does
amazing makeup tutorials I don't feel
like a special bond with her like I do a
couple other youtubers if that makes any
sense to you guys watching but I just
didn't feel a huge pull I also didn't
feel like the colors in this collection
we're really like Samantha's type of
colors so I decided to skip over it so
in the collection they came out with
three different liquid lipsticks and
then a highlighter that has three
different shades and it was $79 for the
collection there was some coupon codes
rolling around up there but basically
$79 for the three lipsticks and the
highlighter wheel first released that
was the only way that you could get it
you had to spend the $79 even if you
didn't want all three lipsticks even if
you only want two lipsticks and not the
highlight or the highlight nihilistic
whatever you had to purchase it in the
bundle and then a few weeks goes by and
I was okay well we're going to come back
and you know obviously it sold out
because like one week of release launch
doesn't so out so it sells out and then
they're like oh well we'll come back now
on we'll sell them individually and I'm
like well that's rude like that should
have been done in the first place so I
just feel bad for people who bought the
collection and they were like they
didn't want one or two of the items but
they still bought the whole thing
because they had to and now just a few
clips Oracle will bring about
individually I'm like oh I wasn't so bad
if I would have bought the collection
for just like a handful of items and
then they brought it back so quickly
individuals like I felt like when makeup
companies play us like this like oh my
gosh this is limited edition inspire
right now guess what we're bringing it
back and like I don't know like just oh
like one part of me gets it I'm like oh
that's great they're listening to their
customers and yada yada they're bringing
back things that people really love so
they've just chance again and I'm like
well stop saying like a so limited
edition you have to get it right now and
then you just bring it right back like I
don't know I find it to be annoying but
that's just me but I'm glad that I
didn't buy the collection because that
would've made me really angry to see the
individual but even when the individuals
came out there's really nothing in there
that I was like oh I absolutely have to
have this I don't need the highlighter
most of the lip colors are not meet the
news lipstick is more my style but I
know I absolutely do not need it I
bought 10 news lipsticks in one day yeah
I bought the Sephora favorites
give me some nude lips which had six
ellipses in there and in the Kim
Kardashian I'm wearing one Phillippe's
right now and Kylie cosmetics which came
with four lipsticks and left them on the
same day I bought 10 nude lipsticks in
the same day
like obviously I have a problem so I
definitely didn't need it I still don't
feel the pull for it I see people
wearing it and talking about it and you
know great and dandy and all but I just
don't feel like that oh man I really
wish I would have bought that I just
don't get that feeling so that's how I
know that this is not a regret for me
another highlight palette that I still I
do not regret not buying is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills Aurora
palette this is one of her newer
highlight palette releases this is the
one that came out like right on the
heels of the anastacio and Nicole
Guerrero Nicole glow palette and I was
like confused how quickly they were
being released behind each other like I
was just like okay you just came out
with in cope out why you need to turn
around and come out with another six
shade almost like holographic you're a
definite type of highlighters like well
it's highlight was lash am i right and I
had went ahead and purchased them to Col
blokes I thought it was super pretty
very unique I like Nicole that super fun
that she's blogging now so like doing
more blogs on her youtube channel except
that was really cool so I wanted to
support and I had a whole experience
with that I said in my video when I got
my fist shadrach blow kit from anasazi
Beverly Hills I was like nope I'm not
buying anymore glow kids they cannot
give to me without being broken so I'm
not going to do it and still more people
were telling me that they got their
palates broken more people were telling
me that they did purchase the abroad and
those were coming broken I'm like super
awesome so far like it just likes to
spend your money and have products get
to you and not even not be what you want
them to be like you try them out you're
like oh no less is not for me
but they're broken and you can't even
like give them the fair shot anyways
it's just a such a bummer but I really
am not mad at all that I didn't get that
Aurora palette I see the swatches of it
I see people wearing it it looks really
beautiful definitely but I honestly have
not even been reaching for my Nicole
palette all that much there's been other
highlighters that I like there the
texture in the formula more of them the
pixie highlighters I'm wearing right now
pixie beauty in collaboration with
the no guard I'm wearing suit those
highlights right now and the Smashbox in
case the home highlights those are like
my go-to right now I cannot stop wearing
them I think they're beautiful and I
just like how it will look on skin more
I think that Nicole pellet highlights
texture a little bit more than I wish it
did so I don't even reach for that one
as much as I wish I did after spending
$40 on it but the soy it is so totally
not mad so I skipped over at the Aurora
another highlight palette that I don't
regret not buying is the huda beauty
highlight palette she came out with some
and I lashed her video on them and they
just really didn't look like highlight
palettes that I felt like I needed and
to me I think she was trying to make
them seem like they were going to be
really unique highlight palettes like
they were called the 3d highlight
palette but in my humble opinion they
were pretty like typical highlight
palettes and I just did not need any at
the time that she was releasing them I
was buying all the other highlights and
I knew I didn't need them and still now
I just do not feel the pull I really
don't even see a ton about them on
social media I do see posting or
everyone smile here and there but I
don't find people you know like when a
release comes out and so many people
love it and you just get like slammed
every time you turn on Instagram or
YouTube people are talking about how
much they love products I didn't see
that with this one and I honestly really
didn't think that I would so that is why
I didn't have an issue passing them up I
like you to beauty a lot I like a lot
for other products her lipsticks her
eyelashes but the highlight palette just
really wasn't doing anything for me and
I still don't regret not buying it of
course with all these products if I'm
mentioning a product that I don't regret
not buying and it's your favorite and
you absolutely love it obviously that's
fantastic I say this in a lot of my
videos we're all very different in our
wants and needs and our makeup game and
our makeup collection and what we want
to purchase and spend our hard-earned
money on so no offense of course if any
of these products of your favorites I'm
just saying for me personally what I
don't regret not buying obviously so
let's continue so another one of em to
face that I did not
right not buying was the two-phase
peanut butter and honey palate
I knew right away I said this in a boy
lies diet video I was totally not
interested in it it did not look to me
like an eye shadow tell it that I
absolutely needed I didn't think it
looks special or unique at all there was
a yellow shade in there that I liked but
other than that it looked like a pretty
standard palette and I talked about how
I had not been impressed about the Too
Faced releases lately I thought the
white chocolate chip palette and I just
didn't want to buy any of these like
special little releases from Too Faced
because I felt like they were really
really subpar and I totally did not
regret not buying this one and as I saw
horrible horrible reviews on it I had so
many youtube friends that bought it so
they could review it and try it out
do some tutorials with it and almost all
of them ended up returning it because it
was just a really bad palette so I
definitely do not regret not buying that
palette because I probably would have
ended up returning it just like I did
with the Too Faced white chocolate chip
palette again if it worked for you
fantastic but I have a really good
feeling that we would have not have
gotten along so that one is definitely
one I don't regret the last one that I
have for this video with that Lancome
LaRose blush powder the highlight that
look like a row with and have like a
little highlight dust sprinkled on it
and you could like just off the rose and
put the highlight on I mention it in
blue eye bright video and I was like
damn that packaging is amazing I'm all
about that Rose highlight little box
oozing looks kind of vintage e and she
looks absolutely gorgeous I was like yes
please on the packaging but no no one
everything else it was $60 for all
highlight basis $60 for a highlight and
I'm over here my lullaby videos like $28
is really expensive for a highlighter
this is 60 I might not out and I watched
a lot of review videos on it and of
course there was some people because
they're all different not everybody
hates one thing that everybody loves one
thing you know there's always going to
be different opinions but in some people
grow like I look so beautiful on the
highlight is still love William Oh
wonderful and I'm there with other
people that were like I just got played
I'm like yeah
question just a blade what I was hearing
is that there just wasn't a lot of
actual highlight in there it was hard to
get the highlight off like it just was
more of a hassle than anything almost
kind of like I don't want to say it was
gimmicky but you know kind of along
those lines but a lot of people are
saying it just was not worth it the
highway it wasn't like the boom and pop
and highlight with a lot of people like
it was more of a subtle highlight and
for $60 like I'm going to need to see a
little more than that of course the
packaging was super cute your plants
with the packaging you're paying for the
lancome name but i don't know a lot of
times i would rather pay for the actual
product so that we're getting and what
i'm going to use it for you know this
man so I totally do not regret buying
that Lancome rolls when I first thought
come out I did the double take and I was
like I totally need that and then I saw
the price and I was like I just can't go
out I did that mmm
net I'm good so I definitely do not
regret not buying the Lancome Rose
highlighter and then after that that's
going to do it for this edition of
makeup that I do not regret not fine I
guess oh that's going to do it a for
this video
I wasn't makeup that I do not regret not
buying I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this video of course let me some
comments down below let me know what you
think of all the products that I
mentioned did you guys buy any of these

love them did you not love them or they
just okay I would love to get your
guys's feedback and opinions especially
on the products that I talked about cuz

let me know in the comments down below
again I do apologize for my voice I know
I'm not 100% back in the game yet but
perfection to me is really never an
important thing I really don't have an
issue making a youtube video looking
less than perfect taunting less than
perfect I'm still swollen and you know
what it just it is what it is
I'm human and I'm not going to let a
free and wisdom tooth procedure knock me
down for you know over
because it's not going to happen so I
know my last two videos have probably
sounded a little bit funky with my voice
but I hope to be on track here coming
shortly but I just perfection is not
something I strive for and if I did I
would probably not do anything with my
life so there's that but thank you guys
for sticking by me thank you to my
snapchat fan for being still amazing I'm
subbing during this time I know that
I've been really bummed out the last
couple days and you guys have supported
me and kept me motivated and I think you
guys so much for that but as always if
you did enjoy this video please make
sure to give it a thumbs up I hope that
you will consider subscribing before you
go and I'll speak to you guys real soon
in my next one
