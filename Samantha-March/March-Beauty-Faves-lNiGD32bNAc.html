channel so today's video is going to be
my large beauty favorites so I'm going
to be talking about everything makeup
and beauty why's that I was loving on in
the previous month I do want to give you
guys another Instagram update I talked
about it a little bit in my last video
about how my account unfortunately it
was a part of the several several
accounts that was affected on an update
that went through it was wednesday night
of this week and my account has been
disabled since wednesday march 30th as
of today it's April first and it's not
on April Fool's joke I still don't have
an Instagram account I don't have my
regular Instagram account March beauty
word so this morning after being without
Instagram for about 48 hours I just went
ahead and made another account its March
beauty Inc if you want to find me over
there I'm over there and just basically
trying to find my feet again it was very
overwhelming going from working on
Instagram for a full year and just
working hard to make connections on
there and find you know post the best
content that I could find and then just
having like a freak accident happen
unfortunately an Instagram doesn't seem
to be helping anybody's have their
constable obviously I've been watching
the the situation very closely following
things on social media talking to other
people who had their accounts disabled
they all happened Wednesday night right
around the same time as well and there's
been no word from Instagram on why that
happened in what they are doing to help
so I still hope to recover March beauty
word hopefully because all of my my
photos are gone my videos are gone
obviously all my friends are gone which
really sucks because when I started the
new one this morning trying to remember
everybody's usernames and that sort of
thing and just being completely blank
having nothing to go off of was so hard
because March beauty word is completely
wiped out like there's no traces of it
left eye it's not like i can't post the
account and that you know like i could
go look at the account and look at who I
was following so I could follow them
again it's
completely gone so I guess the only way
to get it back is of Instagram restores
it and they don't seem to be doing
anything about it so unfortunate but
wanted to give you guys an update you
can follow me over at March beauty and
hopefully I'll have good news soon eps
instagram account is back if not i have
another one in the meantime that i'm
going to be working at so we'll see what
happens but that's my little instagram
update and now how about we have into i
have a lot of skin care to talk about
like I think I have more skin care than
I have makeup but it's interesting to me
that that happened all throughout the
month what I do is keep a list on my
phone like anything that I find myself
constantly reaching for or really loving
or talking to people about I will
include in that list so then when the
end of the month comes I'm not like what
was I wearing what was I reaching for
what was I doing with my life this past
month and I I found skincare interesting
because the last few months I've been
really working on my skincare routine
and trying to get a good routine down
and I've been buying some new products
but testing out some new products and
it's interesting to me to see that this
month is mostly skincare because it just
shows that I really actually had been
working on it so i actually did not
realize how much skin care i had until I
was seeing like what to grab and I was
like this is mostly skincare so maybe it
will just start off with that but one of
the things i have is the Garnier
micellar water this is what it looks
like so it's like basically like a big
ol jug of water and but it says it
removes makeup and cleanses and
refreshes I use this to remove my makeup
I don't necessarily use this to like
cleanse or clean my face but I remove I
use it to remove my makeup I just take a
regular like cotton pad or makeup wipe
and squirts squirt a little on there and
then wipe off my makeup it takes off I
makeup it also takes off like what
lipstick which i think is really good I
don't feel like it necessarily is making
my face clean it's not doing something
like a cleanser and exfoliant a toner
etc would be doing so this is what I
usually come in first when I'm starting
the process of taking off my makeup I go
on with this first and then I actually
want to clean my face but I am loving
this for removing my neck my makeup I
don't necessarily love to travel with it
and I
want to buy those like little bottles
where you can pour liquid into so it's
easier to travel with because I'm afraid
it would just like pop open in my bag
and get everywhere but yeah really
loving this another one that i have i
actually bought it with this with the
micellar water because it's also from
Garnier there alta was having a sale but
it's the garnier ultralift miracle wake
up cream so it is a moisturizer that
you're supposed to use in the morning
because it says it's an anti-fatigue
hydrogel moisturizer and it says it's
supposed to give you all day hydration
this formula i think is really
interesting because it definitely is
very has like a very gel like
consistency but it feels so like cool
and refreshing on your face these two
products i believe i've talked about
both of them in my skincare routine
video which is a pretty recent video I
did it as I've been working on my
skincare routine I finally got one down
I filmed the whole video for you guys
and they do mentioned both of these in
here and even though they are both still
fairly new to me I'm caught like I wear
this nearly every single day I do have a
day cream that sometimes i will use if i
feel like i need just a little bit of an
extra oomph throughout the day but
majority wise i am using this one and i
just i love the way it feels ask that i
have that i want to talk about i
mentioned in my skincare routine as well
but it's from origins it's their clear
improvement active charcoal mask I have
a little sample because I live for
little samples but I did some research
on the charcoal masks because a lot of
different companies started putting them
out and I was like okay like look let me
see like what's the deal with the
charcoal masks are and the charcoal mats
are basically it says it's too clean
pores but it also really helps with acne
I don't really struggle with acne a lot
usually only around a certain time of
the month but when that month when that
time hits like I really need something
to help keep the breakouts at bay and
what I have been turning to the last
couple months is at this origins mac and
actually you guys like we are at that
time and i have nobody else right now
like i am I don't know what's happening
I don't know why also because you know
everything that's going out instagram
like I've been stressed out of my mind
at this past week topped with that and
eating like crap and chocolate you know
all that good
stuff that we do I've had no breakouts I
use this almost like preventatively now
like usually the week before I feel like
the breakouts are going to hit I use
this and I don't know I feel like maybe
something is working because I can't
believe I don't have any breakouts right
now I can't believe it so that's the
charcoal mask from origins this is kind
of skin care related it's not what I use
on my face but is from first aid Beauty
it's their ultra Repair Cream and I have
a big ol drilled of it here I love first
a beauty if you watch my skincare
routine I talk about birthday beauty so
many times I have a lot of their
products they are something that I tried
like a sample pack up and this actually
came in it this was the only full size i
think that was in there and I fell in
love with them i'm so happy that i
bought that little guy and I love her
say beauty so this it says um so it's
our ultra Repair Cream for intense
therapy it says it's to hydrate dry
parched skin it also says it relieves my
minor irritation and itching duda eczema
and other conditions says it's for the
face and everywhere but for some reason
like I just did not want to put this on
my face like I don't know it it's a very
thick cream and I just felt we were
putting it on my face and so I didn't
want to do that and I knew that I was I
wanted to do it for my body instead and
I always have some sort of moisturizer
or lotion or something for when I get
off the shower and I will put it all
over my body and I also just have it on
my bathroom sink just if I'm ever
feeling dry or especially like in the
summer when I wear shorts if I notice
any dryness around my knees I can just
easily take that lotion that oil
moisturizer whatever slop it on those
places and call it a day this winter I
really struggled with dry skin like I
struggled so bad I struggle the dry
scalp I struggled with dry skin so did
my husband we actually bought a
humidifier for our room to try to help
like we were switching up she and foods
and conditioners like we were trying to
do whatever it was that we could help
and it was right around like january or
so january-february when it gets really
bad here like just like miserable we've
been so cold in Iowa for so long and we
don't feel like a break is coming and
that's when I noticed my skin was like
just it's it it was like it was like
cracking
not like it was so disgusting and I was
so embarrassed by it and I had this
sitting there because I you know my in
my mind I was like oh I'll use my other
lotion before I use this one and then
I'm like you know what I'm going to try
this one and I've been using it pretty
faithfully for about two months now and
I don't know if you guys can tell like
I've used I've used quite a bit but I
really have been using it very
faithfully every time I get of the
shower anytime that I feel like I need a
little extra help and it has saved my
skin like I credit this for saving my
skin these past couple months in the
winter so I absolutely had to talk about
it I don't think I've talked about this
one from first aid Beauty yet but if you
struggle with dry skin or you just need
a good moisturizer for your body look
into the ultra Repair Cream because it
is no joke this is my last skincare item
I think but it's from Pacifica and it is
their seafoam complete face wash so this
is what it looks like I talked about
this in my skincare routine this was
sent to me in like a subscription box it
wasn't necessarily sent to me from
Pacifica it was just fun tonight
subscription box that lets go you know
put products in and whatnot I want a
yoga challenge with my girlfriend we are
the cheeky chicks on Instagram we won a
challenge we got sent a prize pack and
this was in it and I was very happy
because I ended up really enjoying this
I me a little bit to try it and I'm not
really sure why because I've had my eye
on Pacifica for a while and then I was
like what am i doing like try this out
and I did and I fell in love with it so
it does it removes makeup cleanses and
tones it has coconut water CLG complex
and powerhouse antioxidants does say it
is good for all skin types I really
enjoy the smell of this it's almost got
like a butterscotch type of smell when I
put it on my face I'm like that smells
really nice I will say I have sensitive
skin and this makes me pretty red
afterwards my skin feels very clean it
almost feels I don't want to say it
feels stripped because I know what that
feeling is like and that to me is like
kind of painful but it just feels like
it's done a little bit extra like it's
not an exfoliant but it kind of almost
feels that way which I thought was very
interesting and but but I love it I you
I typically
use it in the morning for some reason I
just gravitate more towards using this
in the morning because I just feel like
it makes my face so clean and like so
fresh and so ready to like put makeup on
it you know make it not cleaned anymore
why not but I've really been enjoying it
I feel like there's probably about half
left in here and that kind of makes me
sad because I'm gonna feel like I'm
going to go through this really fast but
I use it almost every single day so you
know that I have is from Tarte and it is
their skin rejuvenating me recoja
self-tanning face towelettes these are
what the package looks like i bought
this off the tart website i think it was
like ten or fifteen dollars for ten of
them and i actually got one free one as
like my sample gift but they just come
in a little pack like this so there is
one tell let inside here it's just a
little square basically all of this is
just a SAP a self-tanning tell it you
just rub it all over your face and then
you get a little bit tanner I really
like these because they are specifically
designed for the face and with my
self-tanning routine I just used the tan
towels there another just a tail light
that i use for my whole body but i
prefer not to use them on my face and I
know tantowels does have once for your
face specifically as well but I didn't
buy those and I just kind of figured
like why bother using the towel that on
my face because i exfoliate so much and
you know yadda yadda like whatever i'll
just save the towelettes and use them
just for my body so when I saw that tart
had the ones just for the face and I was
ordering some lipsticks from him anyways
I was like I'll just give it a try and
see and I was really surprised to see a
big difference I do think especially
because with our face we exfoliate and
we're losing that tan fast I do think
you need to use them on a pretty
consistent basis I used one I used it
twice in one week and I noticed a big
difference and then i spaced it out as
only using one every week and then I
kind of couldn't see the results as much
so I think you need to be pretty
consistent about it buy it and do
probably at least two times a week if
not three if you really do want like
color on your face but so far really
liking them and they seemed pretty
affordable on the tart website I think
they have a map sephora and also
as well I would just say to like maybe
use a glove when you're applying it or
else your hand can kind of turn tan or
else just wash your hands really good
but I typically just throw like a
plastic glove on and apply it that way
and it works out well I so i feel like i
have mentioned this in a favorites video
but like probably not for a few months
so I feel okay mentioning it again but
it is from posh wait it's from perfectly
posh I was like posh what Thor something
posh from perfectly posh and it is there
Oh peaches super fabulous sugar scrub so
that's what the packaging looks like I
got sent a perfectly posh package a
couple months ago and this was included
in it and what it looks like on the
inside I've actually used quite a bit of
it but basically it's just a sugar scrub
for your lips and I use this probably at
least twice a day especially when I wear
it liquid lipsticks a lot and liquid
lipsticks can be very drying on the lips
so I am constantly using this to help
like exfoliate the lips and I just I
love it it stays right by my desk like I
said I use it at least twice a day I've
been loving on it for so long and I know
I've mentioned it before but I feel like
it's been a while so I'm like I'm gonna
tell you guys again because i feel like
if you are a big liquid lipstick where
you should be doing some sort of scrub
or lip treatment or something because
liquid lipsticks are no joke but from
perfectly posh it is the Oh peaches
sugar scrub next I want to talk about my
nails so I have been chatting about my
nails recently if you don't follow me on
snapchat I really hope you will I'm
Samantha got March especially with
Instagram going down like that was my
like almost my only way to communicate
with you guys like yes I have facebook
um but you know who really actually
likes my camera shut off while filming I
don't know why it didn't do the little
sign that says it's overheating so I
don't know I got a new camera don't
really quite know what i'm doing yet but
i was talking about nails and nailed her
um hopefully i showed you my nails I
have a wonderland on in the Stiletto
form they have stiletto squad oh Square
and oval squall little is between like
square and stiletto but I have just been
hang on this is the third set that I
have had on each set so far has lasted
me about a week and when I say that I
mean like the nails didn't actually come
off yet I just kind of like looked like
they could come off like they were kind
of separating a little bit from my
actual nail and I would just soak them
in hot water and pop them off I actually
found an even better way that I prefer
to take them off and that's just like
being in the shower after I'd like
shampooed and you don't even like
condition my hair I just kind of let my
fingers go under the water for a while
and pop them off and it's much quicker
and easier I thought then soaking them
in the hot water so that's why I prefer
to take them off but yeah you can have
really fun nails that lasts for a week
you don't have to be worried about them
popping off like I type and do dishes
like i mentioned shower I work out I
mean I just live my life but with these
fun nails on and because they're so easy
to put on and take off like I put these
on I started to film and I was like oh
crap i didn't put nails on yet and it
took me probably under five minutes to
put all of these on because now I've
just like kind of gotten used to it and
like I said this is only my third set so
I love them it's fun it's a way to like
do fun and different things with nails
that don't have like glitter or any 3d
designs on them like this has like a 3d
raised design on it but ones that don't
you can actually paint over them with
nail polish and I did that with my
square side I painted them two different
times and you can Pam and then you can
take the the nail polish off and my
square ones actually did have like a
gold line on some of them and that line
is still there but the white polish that
was there is still there like the actual
nails weren't harmed so I can still use
all my fun nail polish colors and all
that so I've just been loving on them I
think each set is like around $13 but i
do have a ten percent off discount code
it is just samantha March if you use
that I'd check out a bit ten percent off
your purchase that is an affiliate code
just so you guys know I would earn a
commission on that but yeah I will have
all that information linked in the
description box below of course the
codes and any other code that I might
have if you're interested in but also
any of the products that I talked about
will be in the description box below as
always but yeah those are my name
I think I just have to make up no 33
more problems to talk about and two of
them are lip products surprise surprise
but two of them are also some color pops
or as bras so one from colour-pop that I
want to talk about is one of the cream
gel liners and it is in get paid how do
I want to do this there we go this in
the shade get paid so this is what the
sun looks like get paid is a very pretty
like metallic rose gold shade but i
absolutely love their liners I have
tried the pop form of these and I no no
no there are no good get the liner's
they're like five dollars and they are
amazing in my last makeup tutorial my
spring makeup tutorial the pop of green
I had on my under eye that is a crème
de liner from colour-pop they stay in
your water line for so long they are so
vibrant like the man the colors are
amazing all the ones that I have I think
I own five now and I want to keep buying
more because i think they are incredible
but the one I have like i mentioned is
in get paid it's a metallic rose gold i
love the metallic of it because it just
brings like an emphasis to the eyes i
love to put it like in the inner corners
of my eyes and it just like makes you
look pop I love using this when I'm
going for like a bronzy look which I do
so many bronzy looks come summer like I
feel like that's all I'm trying to be as
like a bronze goddess or something and I
feel like this is going to get a lot of
use and then to lip products to talk
about the 1i have from colour-pop is
actually an an old purchase like a year
ago purchase but I started wearing it
recently and I was like was I get why
did I stop wearing this because it's
beautiful of course it's not what I have
on today today I have on teeny-tiny from
colour-pop but the color that I'm
talking about is beeper and Oh beep like
I feel like so many people love deeper
and I don't know why I don't know why I
stopped wearing it but I put it on the
other day and I was like wait a second I
need to wear this more and such a
beautiful like kind of brown it's kind
of like a brownish color and I can
insert a picture in here because i know
i just took a picture of it the other
day on my lips i can insert a picture so
you can see what it looks like here but
it is just
a bomb color I love the color pop ultra
matte liquid lipsticks I think they are
amazing they are are they six dollars on
their website so they are super super
affordable and I feel like beeper is
like a fav for so many people so if you
haven't tried Bieber yet go try it and
then the last product that I have to
talk about is from Tarte it is one of
their tardis lip paints in so fetch and
this is what the little packaging looks
like so fetch is like a bright neon pink
color it is a crazy beautiful color for
spring I did mention this in my top lip
pink blah blah blah in my top lip why
can't I do my top lip pics awesome video
I do mention this because the color is
so bomb for spring it's so bright it's
so vibrant it's so pink it is so
beautiful i love the name so fudge
that's so much fun the TARDIS lip pains
I have mentioned this in a few of my
videos but I feel like you either love
them or you hate them they are not like
a traditional liquid lipstick and when I
say that it's because mostly because
they don't dry down all the way they
will still transfer onto like cups and
straws and all that stuff so they don't
dry completely matte but I kind of like
that for a reason because they dry
mostly mat and when they do transfer
they're not really transferring the
color away so you're not losing any
color payoff but also they are easier to
reapply like usually you can't reapply
liquid lipsticks because they just get
too crusty and gross it also doesn't do
like the weird like crustiness that
happens on your lips like a regular
liquid lipstick would so I enjoyed those
about it I do wish that it didn't
transfer because of course you know that
makes life easier but pros and cons of
each but I have two of the TARDIS lip
paints now i also have TBT which is a
beautiful like mauve color and i just
love them so i'm a big fan of them i
know not everyone is i would say maybe
before you buy one like go to sephora or
alta and try it out and see how you feel
about it because I bet your ears are
going to love it or hate it there's
really not a whole lot of in between but
I was
so so excited because I actually shared
a photo on Instagram with so fetch and
tart reposted at me and I was so excited
like it was such a good day and there
was so much like kindness from my
followers and my snapchat family and
just everyone like letting me know and
how probably were of me and my
commenting on the tart photo like how
awesome it was to see and that was so
very cool and it's just another like
reason why it hurts so bad that my
entire account is gone because that just
really really sucks but I was so excited
to see it tart is like the first major
brand to repost me and I just think
that's so cool and they're always going
to hold special place in my heart and
how I feel like so fetches and I'm
really glad that ended up loving the
color because I was like this might be a
little too crazy for me but and that is
everything for my March beauty favorites
