channel so Lily's video is going to be a
favorites video this is going to be the
book favorite book favorites that we had
on my book look at Chiclets plus for the
month of March so if you are not
familiar with that I am also very
heavily in the book world I'm an author
but I'm also a book blogger I own
Chiclets plus and we do several book
reviews over there author interviews
guest blogs all that good stuff so I
also do have a fantastic review team
because I just cannot handle all of the
review review requests that come in from
authors and publishers and publishing
houses so I have an excellent review
team that helps me review all of these
books and in this favorites video I'm
going to go over all up the five-star
books that myself and the review team
gave think i have six books to talk
about this month so I'll kind of explain
what the reviewers said about the book
or what I said about the book and why we
think they are fantastic books to read
one thing that I do want to mention
really quick because I feel like it's
affecting my demeanor I'm filming this
on Thursday March 31st it's about two
o'clock in the afternoon and the day
prior so Wednesday March 30th at right
about four o'clock p.m. my Instagram
account has been disabled so I was
marched beauty word on Instagram my
account is completely gone I don't know
what happened I don't know if it got
hacked and something weird happened I
don't I don't know what happened but
it's gone like I was on Instagram and I
kicked me off and when I tried to lock
bike in it said that my account had been
disabled for violating Instagram
policies which i can say with a hundred
percent certainty that I've never
violated any Instagram policy I don't
even know if I would know how to violate
an Instagram policy I'm pretty
straitlaced as they come but so I don't
know if the account got hacked and
something weird was happening um I don't
know and I have tried I've probably sent
12 messages now to Instagram trying to
get my account back or just trying to
learn what happened
but I mean everything's gone it's not
like I just can't log in but Maya
council there everything is gone my
photos my videos everything's go I can
tell I'm definitely weird mood um you
know obviously it's not that of the
world I can start a new Instagram but
I've been on Instagram for just about a
year I started it right after I start at
YouTube and I've been on YouTube like my
first video went up at the end of april
so it's been almost a year but I worked
really hard on the Instagram I worked
hard on the photos that I shared in the
videos that i put together and it wasn't
ever anything like i would just snap a
picture and upload it like i was really
learning how to edit and all that good
stuff every photo that you saw on there
took a while to create and perfect and
get it just right and learn things about
hashtags and what times i should post
and and all that so for all of that to
just get wiped completely away like that
your work never happened is very
frustrating it's very frustrating and I
think it's just mostly frustrating
because I don't know what happened I
don't know how to prevent this I don't
know if it's going to happen again I'm
seeing some people as saying that like
Instagram is having a bad virus going on
now and it's affecting a lot of people
some people I know I've gotten their
accounts disabled summer and like
Instagram jail or they can't post new
photos or comment on any photos but they
still have their account some can't
login it just does like their password
is wrong they know what's right like i
don't know i know that Instagram did
some sort of like funky update because
now they're changing our fees and all
that stuff but i don't know why that
would mean I'd have to get my entire
account disabled and get no one to help
me if you guys ever do have any problems
with Instagram just so you know they
don't have a real help desk they don't
really have anyone that will help you
apparently um they don't have a phone
number you can contact I don't have an
email you can contact you can send in
like basic forms on their help desk but
who knows where that's going to and no
one has responded to me in a day so
thanks
just so you guys know I had no idea
Instagram what do things like that but
apparently they do but I just wanted to
address it a because I'm getting so many
questions i'm getting questions on
facebook twitter snapchat here on
youtube everyone's like where's your
where's your Instagram or Instagram
especially because I have weekly and
monthly giveaways all the time over
there like everyone's asking where I am
I'm I'm in limbo right now i don't know
if i should cert and you account i don't
know if i should keep waiting and if
anything has changed by the time this
video goes live i will go ahead and
leave that in the description box below
so you guys know but I just I really
don't know what I'm supposed to be doing
right now like I don't know what to do
with my hands like I'm confused sorry
this intro is so long and it really has
nothing I mean nothing at all to do this
video but I just want to let you guys
know because definitely tell that my
attitude is affected by it well life
goes on I'll let you guys know what
happened I just wanted to throw it out
there not to like complain or be sad or
like be dumb or anything like that but
just because I know that it's affecting
my whole like demeanor I'm not quite
myself today and that's why okay anyways
how about we just jump into the video
let's talk about good things let's talk
about favorites let's talk about books
we love if you'd like to see the book
favorites forum chicklet plus for the
month of march we go one good thing that
has happened recently is that i bought
myself a camera so now i can actually
work off my cell phone instead of having
the laptop in my lap when I do these
kinds of videos so that's nice but the
first book that got five stars is
sisters of heart and snow by Margaret
dill away and i will insert the covers
here at like i normally do for all the
book photos but leah is the one that
reviewed this one and from amazon it
says the award-winning author of how to
be an American housewife returns with a
appointment story of a strange sisters
forced together my family tragedy who
soon learned that sisterhood knows no
limits and let's see Leah's review said
I found this almost impossible to put
down if I didn't have to work the day I
was breeding I would have sat in the
same position never moving except to
flip the page until I had completed the
novel even when I wasn't reading the
book its plot remained in my mind and it
was so compelling I couldn't
and away from it I mean if that's not
like what you call a raving review I
don't know what is so that is systems of
heart and snow by Margaret dill away the
next one we have is Natalie's getting
married and this is by Rosa temple and
christy is the one who reviewed this one
from amazon it says career-minded
Natalie Spencer had never been in love
she can never understand what all the
fuss was about but when she met Jackson
Humphries during freshers week at
University it's at all changed this is
the tale about for wedding dresses a
runaway groom and a girl who got so
carried away she couldn't see true love
staring her right in the face and from
Christie's revealed she said this was a
great read by Rosa temple fast pace and
full of surprises Natalie's getting
married was a true enjoyment to read the
next one we have is a five star review
from me and this is live for this and
it's by Catherine rbl I've read several
Catherine's books I've highly enjoyed
them definitely an author i would
suggest checking out for all these books
that i do mention i will leave the
amazon links in the description box
below as well as the links to the review
on chocolate plus you can read the full
reviews there as well but live for this
we fought a little Sameera and I hope
I'm saying that right I'm really not
positive I know when I hauled this one I
was like Sameera I think I'm saying it
right um from amazon it says she's
living the party girl life i really
don't i don't need to read from amazon
because i read this one but I live for
this was it's a women's fiction novel
and it really covers a lot of serious
subjects and I have just really been
enjoying these books lately ones that
are just a little more hard-hitting in
one set you know almost have like
uncomfortable topics to talk about and
almost like read about because they're
so serious or you know what I'm saying
like you guys understand what I'm saying
here but I really really love to look
for this we we follow samra who like it
said she's a party girl she is sleeping
with a married man who she thinks that
you know she thinks that they're in love
and she thinks that he's going to leave
his wife and she actually gets in a
really really bad situation basically is
is raped by two men one including
her front / roommates boyfriend at the
time and one being the married man she
was seeing and there's a videotape of it
and everything and it gets it gets very
serious like you know kind of hurts my
stomach to read about but it's not a sad
book um I wasn't disturbed by the book
really I mean honestly like yes you're
reading more disturbing things but it
wasn't like oh my gosh I can't read this
because it is so well written it's very
realistic it's so it's like a fast pace
book but not that I thought anything was
rushed are too quick but every like
every time you would get to an end of a
chapter I was like oh I should probably
keep raiding just to like just to keep
about like I just I want to keep reading
this book basically Samra is kind of
like saved by a man named Michael he's
in a wheelchair he doesn't have any
feelings from like his chest down I
believe it was and he's going through
his own situation himself he was hit by
a car and that's when he has his
disability then he was left by his
fiancee and she's actually now getting
married to his best friend who also like
just could not handle who he was after
the accident and so it's kind of like
these to like kind of lost people and
feeling unloved people kind of find
their way together and I was really
concerned when I first read the synopsis
cuz I was like am I going to cry like
the whole book am I going to be sad am I
going to be yada yada yada I wasn't it's
just so well written it's such a good
story like it's such a strong plot and
such strong characters that it was
pretty much impossible to put down it's
one that I keep raving about obviously I
feel like I could keep talking about it
here in this video but I know I should
cut myself off but just definitely one
that I say to check out live for this by
Catherine are Beal so the next one that
we have is sparing the heart and this is
by Tracy krimmer this is another one
that I gave 5 stars2 this is another
author that I highly recommend Tracy
creamer I've read several of her books
I've enjoyed all of them I think I've
given all of her book a big ol five-star
review love love love her books sparing
the heart actually to me I
read these two back-to-back Allah for
this and sparing the heart and not that
they seemed similar in like characters
even really plot but they were similar
and like the dynamic of the book is that
it's women's fiction but we're getting
into serious subjects live for this
definitely covers a lot more seriousness
but sparing the heart definitely does
have it too especially the back story
with Kate's dad which I thought was very
intriguing like every time we would get
little bits of what happened to her
father in the past I was like wait is I
got what like can we keep going can we
keep learning about that because what
exactly happened and but basically Kate
moves to a new town she is a realtor she
moves to a new town after her father's
death her and her father were very close
and after he was killed she just knew
that she needed a fresh start so she
moves to a new town and she kind of
makes friends by joining a bowling
league and I thought that was kind of
fun because my mom used to be a big
bowler and now my husband is on a
bowling league and while I am NOT a
bowler myself it was kind of fun to read
and like pick up the little like bowling
turn some things like that I don't know
I felt that was cool like I felt like
guys something to talk to my mom and
boyfriend about like her boyfriend my
boyfriend about my husband about and so
that was kind of fun like just something
a little well fun for me but also there
gets to be a romance involved and the
romance to me I thought was so
interesting because Kate wasn't always
making like good ethical decisions to me
because her love interest is actually
engaged to someone else and there's like
wedding planning going on and so some of
the times I was like girl you might be
toeing the line over here but what I
thought is interesting about that is
that it does make it realistic we don't
want to read about perfect characters in
every single book and sometimes I get
annoyed with I'm actually reading I'm
listening to a book right now where's
like the character she's perfect she's
perfect she's perfect she's perfect no
one else is perfect she's perfect and
it's like oh come on that's not
realistic at all people so we definitely
want our characters to have some flaws
and not that I disliked Kate at all
because I really did and clearly she
could see that there was
thing you know something kind of funky
in this relationship but I thought that
was interesting I thought that was a
good twist to it it definitely made her
more relatable in my opinion we're all
it was just such a well-written book and
moved at a great pace I really enjoyed
the characters and towards the end it
was like right when I thought like the
end was figured out we knew where we
were going and everything was going to
end like there's like a little twist
thrown in there and I was like whoa I
did not see is that coming which I
thought was really really cool so Tracy
creamer another author to check out and
this book isn't next one I have is also
a five star review for me this is
beneath the surface and it is by Heidi
perks I'll bring a little bit of the
synopsis from amazon it says I don't
know where you are I don't know what I'd
done teenager apical writer is
devastated when she gets home from
school to find her family gone nothing
makes sense things are missing from the
house and her stepsisters his rooms are
completely empty but the police think
she's in trouble and when grandmother
Eleanor tells her to forget them all but
the police thinks she's troubled not
she's in trouble she's trouble and when
grandmother Eleanor tells her to forget
them in move on there's no choice other
than to face the future alone so when I
first read the synopsis I was actually
kind of confused because I was like who
leaves a teenager alone and the police
aren't doing anything about it and the
grandmothers like know what school I was
like what kind of book of my reading but
Abby is 17 in the book which yes I ever
seen a cell a teenager but i was
thinking like 13-14 like I was super
confused and so that kind of the piece
is the hell better into place for me
after I read that but with that out of
the way this book is like psychological
like it really messed with my head while
reading but in a good way of course in a
good way I love the book obviously I
gave it five stars but as as we go on so
we have a bee who was left by her family
her father had passed away and after her
father passed away her mother just
really went downhill like like was not
able to get over losing her husband she
did end up remarrying and then had twin
girls
so we have the grandmother Eleanor so we
have a B and then her mom and then the
grandmother and all three of these women
are they have a lot of stories going on
and i truly like i don't know how to
give a good review because there is so
much going on in this book and so much
that is uncovered like I can't really
say a lot because then I'm going to ruin
something for you and this was a book
that when I was reading and especially
when something big got revealed I was
just like hmm no way like I it like
flabbergasted me and I didn't know what
to do with my hands again I was like I
can't believe that just happened such a
good book so many twists and turns
things I didn't see coming it like I
said it like mess with your head like
you think you know one thing and then
you you don't know anything at all and
then even more is getting oh man it is
such a good book this has to go on your
must-read list beneath the surface by
Heidi perks and the last one that we
have 4 March is by you my love by Lauren
faulkenberry this actually just went up
today as I'm filming it but Mary is the
12 reviewed this book from amazon it
says 30 year old enca Parker is at a
crossroads to prove to her or to prove
to her overbearing father she can flip a
house on her own she takes on an
ambitious project and it puts her in the
path of the most alluring man she's ever
met ok mary says in her review from
start to finish by you my love is packed
with dialogue fire the romance kind and
actual fire and secrets making it easy
to pick up and hard to put down so I
really love this cover I love the title
the synopsis sounds really good I'm like
why didn't I review this one sometimes
my review my review schedule just gets
so full like even though there's books
that I want to review and read so bad
like I know I just can't do it but I'm
so glad that Mary loved it her review
makes it sound like even more like I'm
probably gonna have to pick up this book
