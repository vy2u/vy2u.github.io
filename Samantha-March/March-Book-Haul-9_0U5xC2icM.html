so today's video is going to be a my
latest haul video and i think i have
like a lot of books to go through so
let's not chitchat at all the sun's
going down as well so we just got to get
into it so if you would like to see my
latest book haul before i hop into the
ebooks i did receive to print books in
the mail to review print books we just
don't get as often because you know it's
so much easier and it's much more
affordable send ebooks these days so
ebooks is very very common to send
budget to get to print books the first
one is always the bridesmaid and this is
by lindsey calc i have read several
books from lindsey I very much enjoyed
them she's very chiclet I have loved her
books this one says it's coming out
april fifth so I do have an advanced
readers edition but how cute is that
cover and it was really cute because she
also sent a like tote bag with it and if
you watch my makeup declutter video I
actually used that tote bag to put all
of my makeup in that I'm not going to
want any more the topic was sitting in
my office and as I was starting to like
go through my makeup collection I was
like well didn't that come in handy so
I've already put the tote bag to good
use I love it very cute thank you very
much to Lindsey for sending me not only
a tote bag but the book is well i will
be reviewing this in early april so very
much looking forward to it I don't know
what is happening it today but this is I
this just happened it is the third time
I have matched my phone off of the
tripod I film on my phone I don't have a
camera or anything so I have a high of a
nice tripod and then I have my phone
sitting on like a wooden block on top of
the troika tripod or a camera would go
literally three times when trying to
record this video I have somehow either
hit the tripod at the top at the bottom
my foot hit it everything's gone flying
OMG oh hey refrigerate it right now but
moving along the other one I got I
haven't taken
okay because I thought it was so cute
and I wanted to show you guys but like
look how cute this one is sent to me
from penguin Random House and takes a
little bow off the book is the silk
merchants daughter and this is from
edina Jeffries we've had had we have had
Dina Jeffries on Chiclets plus quite a
bit but i don't think i've actually read
it from Dina this is another advanced
reading copy as well it says it goes on
sale februari 25th is that right ok so I
musta got a few weeks ago but this is an
a or C copy sent to me from penguin but
it was wrapped up in the cute little bow
which I really appreciate it yeah I'm
excited to read it oh there's a thank
you card in here it doesn't say anything
it just says thank you right now moving
on to the hard part and that is going
through the ebooks that are received
because I say it's the hard part since
because I film off of my phone I
obviously cannot use my phone to like
look up the book so i'm going to tell
you about so i have my laptop in my lap
I just dropped on my cards everywhere
because this video is just a freaking
disaster I literally once I dropped at
the second time my phone like once I
whatever I was like you should just not
even required today but I don't have any
time to edit this video so it's today or
the videos just not coming I literally
can't read my handwriting Oh hope your
guys's days are going better than mine
so when I first started the channel I
was able to use my surface to we have
the servers to tablet that I was so
excited to buy I was so happy to have it
it's def it's dead to me like it's it's
literally dead to me I've been saying in
so many of like my recent videos just
how it never works right now there's
always a problem with the internet every
single secur security certificate i
think it's saying none of them is valid
on anything and so I researched it I
looked up how to like troubleshoot the
problems I did all that it still doesn't
work literally surface too dead to me I
never want to buy another like microsoft
surface tablet thing Oh ever
anyways so the first book i have is
friday night brides this is by samantha
chase i will put the cover in here like
i normally will and this cover is so
cute like love is covered okay so from
amazon it says for women 20 years 500
bridal fashion shows says they've been
friends since they were five and
modeling for enchanted Bridal has been
much of a part of their lives as the
friendship has and this season that has
them seeing more than new wedding trends
looks like we follow a group of friends
around weddings and then a little bit
it's a really long blurb so I'm not
going to read it off but then at the
bottom it says for friends for
crossroads for possibilities for happily
ever after so looking forward to reading
that one so another one i have is
beneath the surface and this is by heidi
perks this boat goes on sale march 24th
the day after my birthday um i actually
have already read this i'm not sure why
but my reading list i keep a list for
myself and I review like in the order
that i'm gonna review the books and for
some reason this one jumped very for it
jump like five books ahead on my list i
have no idea what happened i don't know
what i did but i read it and then after
i read it i went to write the review and
put it on amazon and everything i'm like
this book doesn't even come off with
another month what was i doing but so i
have actually read it and who doggie
okay so i mean i guess i don't want to
say too much because I'll put it in my
review video it's a good one you should
probably read it it's very like
psychological had a lot of twists that
left me very confused but from amazon it
says i don't know where you are I don't
know what I've done teenager Abigail
writer is devastated when she gets home
from school to find her family gone
nothing makes sense things are missing
from the house and her stepsisters rooms
are completely empty the police think
she's trouble and when her grandmother
Eleanor tells them to forget and move on
there's no choice other than to face the
future alone when i first read this i
was actually very confused by the blur
because i was like who why would you
leave your daughter it just says team
Abigail writer which teenager could be
13 14 even 15 like you probably don't
want to leave and why would the police
not be concerned it was the grandmother
not concerned but she's actually 17
which you know you're almost an adult
almost on your own that's our thing so i
will i do want to point that out because
when i first started reading this I was
like I'm very very confused I don't I go
to understand what's going on but it
ended up being such a good book a lot of
lives secrets lots of Secrets lots of
family stuff going on and I will be
reviewing this one very soon next one I
have is love Alabama this is by Susan
sands Susan will actually be on a blog
tour but they blocked our company that I
run is called CLP block tours so this
one we were on a sign up for and just
the blurb but also like cover just drew
me in and so I was like I'm gonna
feature this one on CL p and i'm going
to take this one to review this book it
goes out April 13th and from amazon it
says Emma's a fallen southern beauty
queen whose past is barely was whispered
about in her small town with the secrets
and lies surrounding the scandal from
long ago still hunter and something
about Matthew holds the answers if only
she could put her finger on it and I
don't know seeing the words like
southern and beauty queen I was like
this is one for me yes so I will be
reading love Alabama a very shortly
that's when I have is sister dear this
is from Laura McNeil this one goes on
sale April nineteenth so I have an air
sea ebook of this one Laura McNeil is I
I'm fairly confident I have featured her
on my channel before she's also the
author of center of gravity which I read
and absolutely loved and i feel like i
raved about it it was an amazing book i
don't know why but for some reason this
is another one that's like psychological
like center of gravity was it was very
like psychological like a domestic
suspense thriller I don't know why I'm
like gravitating towards those books
suddenly it might be because I am in the
process of writing my fifth book for
those of you don't know I am an author
and that one it's not like a
psychological thriller but it's not
chiclet it's not a happy book really i'm
not totally positive hub
coming out but it's much darker so maybe
that's why I'm like all of a sudden
reading these darker books I don't know
anyways that is nothing to do with us
but sister dear so when I reviewed
center of gravity like several months
ago Laura told me she's like just so you
know you know this next books coming out
would you want it I was like heck yes so
I just got it and the cover just like
ooh cover spokes me out from amazon it
says all a lee marshall wants as a fresh
start but when dark secrets refused to
say Barry to pull her chance and a new
life be shattered forever and it so
she's convicted of a crime she didn't
commit and watched a decade of her life
vanish and now she was out on parole see
like ooh but really it's like cover like
give you give you a little creepy vibes
gives me creepy vibes but I'm so so
excited to read this one I just went and
picked up the notes that I dropped out
earlier and I was so paranoid i was
going to run into the tripod and drop it
for a fourth time and then just like
burst into tears and call it a day
didn't happen though next one i have is
live for this this is by kathryn our
deal i have read several books from
catherine now and the latest one that I
just read was killing me softly I
featured it here on YouTube and highly
highly enjoyed it so I'm excited to read
this one so we follow sameera hopefully
i'm saying that right and she is living
the party girl life while she's trying
to forget about her past and put off
having a meaningful future her lifestyle
catches up with her leaving her in a
wake of personal destruction alone and
homeless she encounters Michael a man
carrying his own baggage in the form of
a spinal cord injury not to mention his
former fiancee is marrying his former
best friend can a man with a broken body
and a woman with a broken soul how each
other find the redemption they need to
become whole again well that sounds like
it's going to make me a little sad but I
really do like Catherine's books
definitely an author to check out and
that is live for this the next one I
have is avanthi as a gift and this is by
fe que caminar caminar really very
positive how to pronounce that but the
book is called avanthi us gift and then
this book one in the
gift saga Fe is an author who is working
with CLP blog tours as well and at first
I thought because I when reading the
synopsis it says in the year nineteen
fifty-six and for me I'm like I'm much
more of a contemporary person so my
first thought was like oh I could pass
this on to a reviewer and then I kept
reading and it sounds like it's a lot of
like Greek fiction and even when talking
with fe she's kind of mentioned just
like all of the Greek like culture and
history in this book and not is what
really intrigued me because I love being
able to read about different cultures
different traditions even things like
food language you know things like that
that is what really interested me so
that was why i decided that i was going
to pick this one up but the very vast
the very last line from amazon is even
Thea's gift is a multi-generational love
story spanning 50 years and crossing two
continents chronicling the lives that
unify two families so that is even
Thea's gift i feel like if i tell you
guys what just happened you're not even
going to believe me you're not even
gonna believe me so when i get ebooks in
order for me to be able to like keep
track of e-books and such i write them
on little post-it notes little posted
nuts this literally is like my
organizational system but that's just
like how it works and then when i read
when i'm finish one I just cross them
off and then I write the next one down
there or else I just spirit like I will
forget all the books that I have I don't
know that's my system that's why I know
that whatever so when I first that down
and I picked up my stack of post-it
notes three of them fell on the ground
and I told you guys that and it was a
really big deal because the whole tripod
for like breaking stuff today so I
wouldn't picked him up i SAT back down I
read it again Thea's gift I put it down
I went to pick up the rest of the
post-it notes and they fell on the floor
again why
yeah hold please all right I made it I'm
back I did knock over the tripod I
didn't like break my leg I didn't kick
my dog I mean nothing crazy happened
from me picking up the closest and
sitting down let's see if we can record
this video without anything else
happening I feel like I'm like mrs.
disaster right now don't know what's
going on next book I have is keep me
posted this is by Lisa Beasley and it
says two sisters share the surprising
highs and cringe-worthy lows of social
media fame when their most private
thoughts become incredibly public and
thus fresh and funny debut novels my
love debut novels not gonna lie excited
because I like books dealing with like
social media because that is like one of
my full-time jobs practically is like
being on social media coordinating
social media doing YouTube you know all
that sort of thing so i'll be very
excited to read this one I think it's
actually like next on my list it's
coming up very very soon and the last
one that I have for my most recent book
haul is sparing the heart this is by
Tracy krimmer it was her past my dog
wanted me to let everyone know that
she's here too so she's here but it says
this is the in the past time pursuits
series and it is Vulcan number three and
what's this one I actually just got done
reading it as a this morning that I'm
filming and we follow realtor and
amateur bowler kate and first off i
thought it was really fun i saw the
cover and then i read the blurb and i
just thought it was like fun to follow a
bowler because my husband is a big
fuller and i was able to like pick up on
like bowling languages in the book you
know I don't know that was just
something fun for me but at the same
time I really really didn't do as well
Tracy Kramer isn't authored that I
absolutely adore I actually first met
her like kind of via social media and
you know we would chat and then she
started sending me her books to review
for Chiclets plus and I think I have
loved every single one of her books I've
read I have in my mind that i've read
like three from her either too i'm
pretty sure it's three they gave her
three books from her and I have loved
them all
one was no different you will see it in
an upcoming review video and i'm sure i
will have plenty of good things to say
but the last one is sparing the heart
alright guys we made it through that
video I'm not gonna lie I wasn't sure we
were going to and then I got super
paranoid because as I went to turn the
camera off to film the outro I was like
what if i wasn't even recording that
whole time and I like was just dropping
stuff like crazy and here i wasn't even
hitting record because if you watched my
most recent makeup tutorial i recorded
like a whole first impressions on a lip
product and I never hit the record
button whoo doggie so it's kind of
interesting because I record it so many
videos one week like I was recording
every single day and even one day I was
able to film two videos and I was just
super caught up and I was like you know
what I want a week to just chill like i
mentioned i am writing a book and I'm
very very immersed in the rewrites right
now for book five and that's really like
where my attention is and so I thought
if I can get caught up on videos and not
have to worry about it I can really
focus on getting that book finish so i
can get it out of my hands into my fader
readers into my editors eventually to my
proofreader you know that sort of thing
and I was also like I just don't want to
wear makeup for a while i was wearing
such heavy makeup every single day that
i was filming and you know going out and
we were traveling and I was like I feel
like my skin just needs a little bit of
a break so that's kind of what i did is
now i'm getting back into the filming
groove and holy buckets what a hot mess
today was let's hope let's hope I've
like worked out all the kinks of getting
back into the filming group again like
fingers crossed so much for watching
this video please do give it a thumbs up
if you enjoyed it or just give it a
thumbs up if you understand the pain of
what I've been going through trying to
film this video I would really
appreciate that I'm not gonna lie please
make sure you are subscribed before you
go and I will catch you guys real soon
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
