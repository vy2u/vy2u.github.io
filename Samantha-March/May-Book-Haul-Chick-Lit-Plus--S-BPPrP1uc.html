so today's video is going to be a book
video I'm going to be sharing a book
haul and also I have a little bit of
book news to touch on if you guys are
new to my channel welcome and I did want
to throw out even if you have been
subscribed for a while this is mostly a
beauty channel but I also do
occasionally make videos on the book
side and that is because that is what my
full-time career is in I am I published
author I also own an independent
publishing company I do a lot of
freelance in the book world for like
marketing editing proofreading and I
also run a book blog that started back
in two thousand nine it is called
Chiclets plus we do book reviews author
interviews author features book features
all that good stuff when I started
triplet plus my concept was books beauty
and all things chick and I decided to
kind of leave the blog more bookish and
then have you to be mostly beauty
because for books people tend to really
like to read the reviews but then for
beauty people like to see visually what
it is that you're creating and doing so
that is kind of how I am splitting my
time between the books and the beauty
side of things but I do want to make
book videos because it is such a huge
part of my life of course so that is
just a little explanation before we get
into things but yes like I mentioned
this is going to be a haul video if
you're sharing a few books that I
recently received from authors and
publicist block to our companies etc so
yeah then I have a little bit of news
for my own publishing company that I
want to share with you guys and that is
it we do not have a lot of sunlight so
let's just hop right it looks that I
received is a swimsuit body this by
Eileen gouge i will insert the covers
for each book over here it says this is
from the Cypress Bay mysteries my Amazon
it says New York Times bestselling
author Eileen gouge blends mystery and
romance and a captivating new novel
featuring intrepid property Maynard Tish
Ballard whose clients beachfront home
becomes the headline-making homicide
scene so I don't know if this is the
first book now is the second novel in
the Cypress Bay mysteries which began
with bones and roses but both books can
be read and enjoyed in any order that is
also from amazon so that's good because
I have not
bones and roses but looks like i don't
need to in order to enjoy swimsuit body
i do love a good mystery so I look
forward to reading this one the next one
that i have is handbags and hooligans
and this is by Lana Turner I have also
just read necklaces and nooses this is a
part of the Presley Thurman mysteries
handbags and hooligans is book number
three i also just finished reading
necklaces and nooses which was number
two i did not get a chance to read the
first book but from the second book I
truly didn't feel like I need it to read
the first one and I enjoyed the second
one as very quick snappy to the point i
read it in about a day really enjoyed it
so I'm looking forward to continuing
with handbags and hooligans from amazon
it says Presley went to Vegas to watch
her front and I get married and the
event turned into solving the mystery of
her brother's girlfriend's disappearance
but actually it wasn't exactly the
school teacher she appeared to be who
was she and was she kidnapped again if
you like kind of more lighthearted chick
lit type of mysteries I definitely say
check out this series and I'm very
excited to read handbags and hooligans
the next one I have is pasta Wars and
this is by Alyssa larell oh and i have
read from her but it's been a while but
I know like that name is familiar that i
have read from her and honestly like the
cover i would like okay I love a good
food ebook I don't know what it is
because I can't cook or bake or just you
know walk into a kitchen it doesn't work
out for me but i absolutely love reading
about food ebooks and from amazon it
says slim successful and soon to marry
the man of her dreams katie Cravens is
leading the life she always wanted as
the face and CEO of pasta pronto of
carbs for the calorie conscious line of
frozen food Katie chooses to live life
like one of her slim line spaghetti
dinners nomas no surprises and
everything tied up in a neat little
package but when Katie's fiance runs off
with another woman and a quality-control
Fiasco since her customers running for
the hills it's time for Katie to make a
change I feel like I'm going to get
along so great with this book I can't
wait to read it I love the cover in my
review will be coming soon okay and then
just a last one that I have is the lobby
this is by Randy m Sherman and it said
this book is satire and I don't read a
whole lot of satire so I was excited to
try something
you from amazon it says welcome to the
Shipley hotel where the perky and
attentive staff provides the gold
standard an artificial concern and
comfort to all the colorful characters
who pass through its polish for us
revolving door and find themselves in
the lobby practically engineered for
eavesdropping san Francisco's juiciest
hotel lobby offers the perfect place to
witness the comings and goings and the
most comedic intersections of staff
long-term residents an eclectic guess it
says Randy I'm Sherman's unique wit and
candor will surely make the reader sit
up stand up roll over or assume an
interested leading physician and take
notice so that sounds like fun i've
actually read from Randy I'm Sherman
before she is going on tour with my blog
