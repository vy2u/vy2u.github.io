today's video is going to be my mail
reviews / may book favorites video so
this is going to be a video dedicated to
all books if you are new to my channel
and welcome or if you are even returning
and you're wondering why I'm talking
about books it is because that is what I
do for my full time job I am an author I
own a publishing company and I also run
a book blog so about once or twice a
month I tried to put out a book video
that is concentrated on either books
that we were reviewing for chocolate
plus maybe new books that my company is
putting out or this video it's going to
be all the past books that I've read in
may i'm just going to feature each title
that i've read and give a small review
and then I also want to shout out all
the five-star books that were featured
on my blog which is called Chiclets plus
from my review team I have a handful of
other fabulous ladies that review books
for me because sometimes with my
schedule I just can't get to all the
books but I still want to be able to
feature them so i will also show about
all the five-star books that were listed
in May I will leave all the books and
our amazon links linked in the
description box below along with the
reviews on Chiclets plus if you guys are
book lovers and want to check out any of
those books but yeah why don't we happen
to my may book reviews and favorites the
first book that I run reviewed is
dangerous kisses and this is by Alice
lake this was a historical like romance
fiction novel and I don't read
historical very often but I do every
once in a while I like to dip my fingers
into something new in the literary world
and so I thought this would be a fun one
to go through because and in this book
to it's just really fascinating for me
to be able to read the historical events
the clothes the way people spoke what
they ate just how they acted you know
obviously it's such a different time
than we are in now but it really is like
fascinating to read and see like how
things have evolved it blows my mind I
thought this one was a lot of fun too
because there's like a secret society in
there there's a little bit mystery in
there and some suspense and overall I
thought it was really fun so I gave that
one a four-star review and that is Dean
kisses bye Alice Lake the next one that
I read was friday night brides and this
is by Samantha chase the cover is what
really like drew me in here I also
really really enjoy wedding bugs I just
I just enjoy writing them we basically
follow for friends and it was
interesting because we do get like a
point of view from each of the friends
which I times I thought was just a
little bit overwhelming I actually when
I first like read the synopsis I thought
maybe this was going to be a part of the
series and then each friend would get
like her own book from her own point of
view and her own issues but we got all
four in one which sometimes could get a
little bit overwhelming because so much
was trying to be put into one book and
so many different lives and situations
and relationships and careers and there
was definitely a lot going on I really
enjoy books about female friendships as
well that's typically what I write about
myself as an author's being able to
explore female friendships is just
incredibly fascinating to me and that's
why I like to write about it but also
what I like to read about so I found
that interesting again just a little bit
too overwhelming and rushed at times but
I gave it a 3.5 star to Friday night
rides by Samantha chase the next one
that I read and reviewed is the yoga of
Max's discontent by Quran bashe not
really positive how to say that name but
the author emailed me himself and asked
if I would like to review this book and
I kind of thought about it for a little
bit because it is written from a male
and in a male's perspective normally I
read more like Chiclets women's fiction
romance where we have a female author
and the book isn't a female POV and so I
kind of went back and forth like mmm is
this a good fit for me the title kind of
caught my attention a little bit because
if you don't know I am also a yogi and
so when I saw yoga I was like good I
don't know I read the synopsis and I was
like clearly this is not about like
someone taking a yoga class so let's not
get that confused but it still sounded
interesting and again like I said I like
to step out of my reading comfort zone
every once in a while that's really
another reason why I decided to read
this one this book almost read to me
like literary fiction which literary
fiction in
I own words is just a little bit of a
slower read a little bit more serious
really like fast-paced or like short
sentences and we're moving along at a
good speed it just is a little bit
slower which sometimes can be hard to
read but also to pin sometimes be quite
enjoyable follow max of course who is
our main character and he decides to
make like a life-changing decision a
life-changing journey and it was very
very interesting to watch him as he goes
along and there's so much that I can say
about this book but I don't want to get
too long-winded here but it was just
very interesting to get a different take
on life is the best way that I would say
it was it was very interesting at the I
think it does a good job of grabbing you
in the beginning it doesn't start off
with more heavier stuff and finding a
different lifestyle it it did a good job
of grabbing you in the beginning and
making you want to understand why max
wants to change his life in such a huge
way which I appreciate it and then it
was just it was just all interesting
from there that's the best word I can
use to describe this one it was very
interesting the next book is a favorite
from our reviewer liberty and this is
her finding fraser by Casey Dyer and
from amazon it says I met Jamie Fraser
when I was 19 years old he was tall
redheaded and at our first meeting at
least a virgin he was in fact the
perfect man that he was fictional hardly
factored into it that's funny that's
good stuff ok so from liberties review
she gave it five stars obviously because
it is a favorite she said one word to
describe this book fun so so fun quick
witty swoon-worthy and fun and at one
point she uses the hashtag my spirit
animal so that sounds amazing so I will
leave the amazon links plus the link to
Liberty's review on chocolate plus below
next one that i read and reviewed is
necklaces and nooses and this is by
alana turner this is the second book and
the Presley Thurman mystery series I did
not get a chance to read the first book
but I have read the second book and
since throughout the third book and this
is a very like quick-paced chiclet
mystery there's not like a lot of gory
scenes like you're not
to be afraid to go to bed at night and
that sort of thing they're just
light-hearted mysteries i would say and
necklaces and nooses her boss like she
works at a boutique her boss is murdered
in the store and then you know just the
whole book is trying to figure out who
did it and what presley is going to do
with her career and all that good stuff
she's got a romance in there and the
romance I actually found very
interesting because it didn't play out
how I thought it would play out and I
can always appreciate that but I would
definitely recommend this series if you
like a good chicklet mystery I read and
reviewed is wedding girl and this is by
Stacey ballast I'm a big fan of Stacey
ballast and i enjoy reading her books
that guy mentioned earlier i enjoy
reading books about weddings it's just
something that I gravitate towards and I
really thought that this would be like a
hit out of the park for me and
unfortunately it really wasn't I like
that there was a lot of light plot
twists in here you kind of never really
know where the story was going to go but
the first chapter you know it's just to
me it's so important to pull readers and
in that first chapter in the first
chapter for me was a little bit long
there was a lot of like run-on sentences
that like made me like slow blink while
I was trying to read them and there's
fluid is a big part of the book and just
the descriptions about food went on and
on and on and i enjoy reading about food
but like not to that point i guess and
then I just didn't always feel a
connection with a main character and
sometimes I just wasn't very impressed
with her and I was kind of bummed out
about it because I really thought this
would be a book that I would enjoy again
like I said I enjoyed the plot twist I
did enjoy like the baking seen some of
the secondary characters like bubbles
and snatch I enjoyed those very much and
got a good laugh out of it so I gave it
a three point five star review but just
a little short for me and then the next
book to feature is the lobby and this is
by Randy m Sherman and this one I wasn't
really sure what to think of because the
genre it listed is satire and I don't
read satire a lot so I was like you know
we'll see what this says so basically
the lobby we get very short clips of a
lot of different people and while that
may sound
overwhelming it truly really wasn't so
we're at the Shipley hotel which is in
the San Francisco and we just follow the
comings and goings of like hotel guests
and hotel workers we get little glimpses
into like I said a lot of different
people's lives but we see how it all
reflects at the lobby of the Shipley
hotel to me it's kind of a little bit
hard to explain but I just want to say
that it's not overwhelming it was very
easy to follow it was funny to see how
different people and situations can
become entwined and I had a really good
time reading it for like one of my first
four ways and just attire I had a great
time reading that I know this book has
won a lot of awards and that is so cool
for Randy and so I gave it a 4 star
review and I think it's one to check out
the lobby by Randy I'm Sherman another
five-star review is for the weekenders
and this is by mary kay andrews and our
reviewer ali reviewed this one in her
review she says a full disclosure I'm a
loyal and devoted fan of this author I
loved every novel she's written and have
wider out a few book signings which is
super cool but she says fangirl feelings
aside this book is a wonderful and
perfect way to kick off the beach
reading season so if you love like going
to the water going to the pool going to
the beach and you like to throw in like
a light hearted book in your bag to read
check out the weekenders by mary kay
andrews moving right along the next one
i have is bon bons to yoga pants and
this is by katie cross this is another
one whose cover I was just like I see
you cover again the word yoga's
mentioned and I'm like what was wearing
yoga pants I love yoga pants I'm wearing
yoga pants right now but this is one
that I truly ended up absolutely loving
and I thought it was so hard to put down
beat follow Lexie who is 22 years old
and we just followed her through her
journey of you know being overweight and
not exactly happy with herself she
doesn't have a lot of confidence a lot
of times like she meets a guy online and
she would think to herself like the only
way that this guy is gonna be interested
in me as if I lose weight because that
is what will make me beautiful and she
just kept getting stuck on the weight
making someone beautiful not her not her
personality not what she could bring to
a relationship
and she does start to like join a gym
and she starts to eat better she joins
like a group you know so they all kind
of like help each other out type of
thing and she meets people on the way
that help her understand you know not
only to not turn to food when she has
problems because that was kind of her
main thing like whenever she had any
sort of like emotion she would turn to
food and she kind of learned you know
not to do that that there's healthier
ways to get your emotions out but she
also really truly did understand what it
actually means to make someone beautiful
and that it really doesn't have anything
to do with outside with the way you look
with how much you weigh and I just
really appreciate it the author's
writing and how she really brought me
into Lexi's world and how I really felt
like I was on the journey with the main
character and I just saw a gross such a
fantastic read and definitely when I
recommend I gave 5 stars2 bonbons to
yoga pants by Katie cross so the next
one that I read is handbags and
hooligans and this is by Lana Turner so
this is the third book and the Presley
Thurman mystery series necklaces and
nooses which I talked about earlier it
was booked to i really liked handbags
and hooligans this time we actually go
to vegas and one of Presley's friends is
getting married possiblys brother his
girlfriend ends up disappearing and then
they're trying to figure out where she
went and she find out that she's a
schoolteacher but she's actually been
working as a stripper and they're trying
to like connect all the dots and see if
she's even alive and what happened and
putting everything together I love that
it was set in Vegas I just I love books
at in Vegas as well as I've only been
there twice I consider it like one of my
favorite cities it's just so much fun
such a cool place to visit and I really
appreciate it like giving an insider
look on Vegas and yeah just a lot of fun
to read like I said these are very like
light-hearted very quick mysteries I
mean if I was having a slow day I could
probably read these books in a day
they're just very quick and very fun to
read so I gave handbags and hooligans it
by Lana Turner a four-star review so the
next book that I read and reviewed was
down the rabbit hole and this is by
Holly Madison this is a book that I
actually read on audio a via audible if
you guys are not familiar
with audible I definitely think it's
something that you should check out I
listen to audio books every single day
how I like to listen to audiobooks is
when I walk my dog when we go for like
you know two or three mile walks outside
I just popped my headphones in I have
audible the app on my phone plug my
headphones in and just listen and it
helps give me something to do while we
walk because if I just like had to stare
into space we probably would not walk as
much and I always know when I'm reading
a good book because it's when I make her
walk more miles or we go on three to
four walks a day instead of our regular
too and I'm like let's go back outside
you know I want to know what happens in
this book or it's really good for
cleaning too when we weren't quite
having great weather yet I had actually
downloaded this book it was like the
weather was starting to turn so I ran
audible right away and download it down
the rabbit hole and then we had like
kind of crappy weather going on for a
while so I would clean I would clean my
bathroom I cleaned out like I cleaned an
entire room through things away
reorganize things and it was because I
had like the drag to do it i was
listening to my audiobook so that's the
way that i use audible i just i really
love them i will leave a link listed
down below if you guys have not tried
audible what you want to i have a link
for like a free trial you can get your
first audio book free and listen to it
if you decide you like audible you can
sign up to be a member for it if you
don't like it and you don't have to you
just get your free audio book but i'll
leave that listed below but i love
audible listen to audio books every day
but you know the first one that i
download it for this spring/summer
season it was down the rabbit hole by
holly madison and if you're not familiar
with it holly madison was one of Hugh
Hefner's girlfriends Hugh Hefner of
Playboy and the Playboy Mansion and
Holly lived in the Playboy Mansion i
think is for like 10 years or something
10 or 11 years it was a very long time
she was featured on the reality show The
Girls Next Door along with Bridget and
Kendra who are other girlfriends at the
time and I do have a pretty lengthy
review on chocolate plus if you guys
would like to read it I of course will
leave it listed below and I don't know
this was very very interesting to read
so I gave it a foursome review i can
tell you guys that it was interesting to
me
because I don't understand how Holly
wrote it and that was did she not sign
like a nondisclosure agreement how was
she putting out things how was she like
naming people and naming certain
situations that I can't imagine playboy
would want that to be out there sign a
waiver but she just didn't care about it
I was just very confused how things like
this were coming out very eye-opening
there's a lot of information to be
learned about how you become a
girlfriend of Hugh Hefner how you're
treated as a girlfriend is Hugh Hefner
but was what was most interesting to me
probably was seeing how Holly said what
a terrible person who have nervous how
he's manipulative any thrives on drama
and he always would pick the girl
friends against each other the names
that he would call the girls how he
would treat them like it was very
interesting and I guess another part
that I just found very intriguing was
that I never saw that on the shows i
watched the girls next door i watch i
was in college when it came on and i
just thought it was like so fascinating
an eye-opening as a girl living in
central Iowa like whoa are you kidding
me but I just thought it was very
interesting but I never really saw that
side a few Hefner and then even after
Holly left the girls next door and she
went on and did other things she always
seemed very protective of hef when his
marriage was called off when does the
whole like runaway bride think happened
holly was the one that was so upset
about it how could she do that to half
and you know he doesn't deserve that and
I was like where was the turning point
that she went from I'm in love with this
man I want to have children with this
man sticking up for this man to writing
a book but just lays into him like I
don't know what happened I think it's
weird I think it's a little suspicious
and again like just with everything in
the story i'm not sure all of it is true
but I mean it's Hollywood who knows
sometimes the truth is stranger than
fiction but it was interesting very
eye-opening if you're a fan of Playboy
the girls next door you followed any of
that your fan of celebrities you know
you like going to people calm every day
this would definitely be an interesting
one to read
very intriguing so the next one I have
is the total package and this is by
Stephanie Ivanovich this was actually
the next audio book that I read or
listen to i guess so i really haven't
read much from Stephanie Ivanovich but I
hear her name a lot and I saw the total
package and I saw that we follow a
professional football player and we also
follow a professional like sports
broadcaster which it was always one of
my dreams to get into sports
broadcasting I never did and now I just
drooled over athletes quite frequently
Kris Bryant Clay Matthews call me
thought this would be a really good book
for me and unfortunately it was just
another one that kind of fell short as I
was listening to it on my walks i would
find my mind like wandering and most of
the time with audio books I do a pretty
good job of picking out my audio books
but you know usually I'm listening and
if I miss something like if a loud truck
goes by or you know I go by like the
garbage truck or something i'll rewind
it so I make sure I haven't missed
anything and with this one I was just
kind of like yeah my mind would wander I
you know maybe miss certain parts but I
have bothered to rewind I didn't
understand the romance between the two
main characters and that's basically
what this book is about so the couple
that we follow met in college they have
like a night together they go their
separate ways and then they actually
meet back up he's a football player
she's the sports commentator and they
get together again you know there's a
lot of like situations that happen but
basically they're trying to be together
again and I just never could understand
the romance I didn't understand why they
were each attracted to each other the
female lead Danny I actually just had a
really hard time connecting with her I
actually connect it with him more than
her which doesn't normally happen but I
don't know it a lot of it just seems
like really far-fetched to me then there
was another secondary character who's
another football player whose plotline I
was just kind of like I don't know about
that either like there's just it wasn't
really believable for me on the whole as
a novel there was you know some
interesting plot points to love but then
there's like a almost like a mob
football coach in there and it just it
was hard to to stay invested in
unfortunately for me but I gave it a
three star review
just wasn't one for me that was the
total package by Stephanie Ivanovich and
that is the last book that I have a form
a alright guys and that is everything
for my may book reviews and my book
favorites on chick lip gloss over the
guys did enjoy this video like I said I
do book videos probably one or two times
a month I i was doing more prior but it
seemed like the beauty videos for just
getting so many more views and likes and
comments and all that good stuff but I
didn't want to completely get rid of the
books because it is what I do for a
career every single day so I always do
want to mention them all so I didn't
want to say I own a publishing company
it is called marching ink and we have a
new book that is releasing on jun 20
seconds it is called all access I will
leave the links below and the book is
available for pre-order right now so it
will leaves on amazon link below the
book goes live on jun 22nd if you follow
me on snapchat I've been talking quite a
bit about it because of course it's
always very exciting to release a new
book into the world especially from a
debut author I'm so excited for liberty
to get this book out there and I know
she's excited too it's a romance women's
fiction novel with a bit of a rock star
romance in there so if you like those
kinds of books I hope you will check out
all access but other than that I think
those all I have left to say I hope you
will give this video a thumbs up if you
did enjoy it please make sure you are
subscribed before you go and I will
catch you guys real soon in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
