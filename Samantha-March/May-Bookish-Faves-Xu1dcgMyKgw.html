going to be part 2 of my may favorites
and it's going to be the book edition so
these are going to be all the books in
May that we gave 5 stars2 on Chiclets
plus whether that be me or someone from
my review team so just any book in
general got five so review in the month
of May I always feel like I need to like
start my videos with a disclaimer but
I'm starting this one with a disclaimer
to me and my dog were just on a three
mile walk and so my hair is like kind of
a key because it was up in a bun and I'm
sweating and then I just took it off and
I've like been trying to tame it down
because it was like this bag I was like
oh Lord and I was trying to put my
makeup on like on my sweaty face so I
can film this really fast because we're
actually getting ready to take areas add
to a check-up at the vet so oh I like
hot and sweaty and I'm uncomfortable but
filming this video because they take me
so long to edit I need to fill my days
in advance before I know that I'm going
to put him up so the first book is
actually a book it was reviewed like
April thirtieth or something like that
so I didn't get to include it in my
April bookish favorites so I wanted to
give it a quick mention here because it
did get a five star review and it was
Charlotte's restrained by celia Kennedy
and Charlotte's restrained is the first
one in a series and I also read the
second one which is kathleen's undressed
and I gave that one 4.5 star review just
because it was a little bit slower to me
than the first one in the series but I
really enjoyed both of them and i highly
recommend the series it's I know it's
going to be a lot of fun chicklet which
is what i love the first two books are
out now and the third one I think is
coming maybe like later this year but I
will let you guys know when that one
comes out that was the first one that
got a five star review and then the next
one that got you guys hear that it's my
dog she keeps coming in and out of the
office I don't know what she wants for
me we just took a three mile walk more
well more can I do but the next one that
got a five star review was I
regret nothing by jen lancaster and this
is it's kind of like the typical jen
lancaster book it's a memoir and i am
such a huge fan of Jen's books I always
enjoy being able to read her and I was
very grateful that this book out sent to
me for review because I was so looking
forward to it and this book kind of
reminded me of like the old gem
Lancaster that came back and I know some
of her like past books haven't been
received quite as well but I really
really enjoyed reading this one I loved
all the self-reflection that happens in
there there's a big Travel section in
there to Italy that I really enjoyed
reading about and I just thought the
book on a whole was so good so I was
able to read that one and I gave it five
stars the next one that guy got five
stars is a vote for Remy and this is by
liana lehman and this one I believe
sandy reviewed this book and she gave it
five stars in it I'm like recording
these so fast I didn't even bother to
like sit down and like reread synopsis
is on the book so i would have any idea
what to say which is probably just gonna
delay me in the long run you're thinking
but I know sandy is more of our like
young adult new adult reviewer so that
makes me assume that this book is more
in those genres and I will leave all the
links to the reviews in the description
box below and also their amazon links so
you guys can check them out if you want
to get any of these books is another one
that got the five stars on Chiclets plus
the next one that got five stars is the
house of Hawthorne and this is by Erica
Roebuck and I think this one was Ali
that reviewed this book i think it was
Ali and this is more of on the
historical side I'm fairly confident
because Erica Roebuck is more tends to
write in the past yet so spanning the
years from the 1830s to the silver war
and moving from Massachusetts to England
Portugal and Italy so more of those
oracle fiction book but i have actually
read Erica Roebuck myself and I really
really enjoyed her writing and I know we
posted her several times on chocolate
plus and I think several different
reviewers have read for her and it just
seems like her books are so well
received the house of Hawthorne got
another five-star review another
five-star review is at the corner of
king street and it's by Mary Ellen
Taylor I'm trying to pull it up i just
got noticed that my service is about to
die so i'm like oh dear here we go race
against time this is at the corner of
king street it's by Mary Ellen Taylor
I'm going to be able to remember who did
this review but they gave it five stars
I've read Mary Ellen Taylor as well had
her the Union Street Bakery books and
they are awesome I so highly recommend
the Union Street Bakery books from Mary
Ellen Taylor they are so much fun to
read and this one at the corner of King
Street also got five stars on Chiclets
plus other one that got five stars from
me is seven years bad sex and this is by
Nicki wells and this was just in my
recent review video and I do mention
that it's definitely for a more mature
audience because it's a book basically
all about sex so you do need to be older
to read that one but I'm a huge fan of
Nikki wells I consider her a friend
because we work together so much over
the years and all of her books I would
wholeheartedly recommend to you
including seven years bad sex because it
is super funny and if you watch my video
you will know don't try to do your
makeup and read this book at the same
time because you'll mess it up the next
one that got five stars on chocolate
plus is bride without a groom and this
is by Amy Lynch I love this cute little
cover I love I love pink covers i mean
when i first started chocolate plus and
i was going to the library and checking
books out to reap you it's embarrassing
that I mostly was just grabbing pink
books or any books with like sparkles on
them I got those too if you go back on
Chiclets plus and go through like I mean
it would take you forever because
there's like hundreds of
reviews but my first like two to three
pages of book reviews on chocolate plus
our books with shiny pink covers don't
judge thought a groom by Amy Lynch I
believe this one was reviewed by
Michelle she gave it five stars I she
just put her review up and I remember I
was like grabbing snippets out of it to
post on social media but I know she said
very good things about this chick lit
book that it is very Chiclets if you
can't tell from the cover already but I
know Michelle mentioned that in her
review so I it really pulls me in from
the cover just uh just a little story
there because of course I'm going off on
a tangent but it's okay because that was
the last ebook i'm showing you on my
surface so it can go ahead and die now
because it only has four percent battery
left oh I probably should have looked at
that before I started filming this video
but I'm in a hurry what else can you do
gotta go the bat as to that I have our
physical copies of books that I got the
first one is French coast and this is by
Anita Hughes and I I said it in my
review video because I mentioned it in
there I just I'm such a huge fan of
Anita Hughes and I'm so excited because
she just emailed me the other day that
she has another freaking book coming out
soon and I'm reviewing it and like
august or something like that and this
one when i read it this was the advance
review or copy it didn't even come out
yet oh this one came out in april okay
no cuz we're only in june that's still
and she's putting another one out at the
end of summer like you go girl you just
you go I don't know how you do it but
her books are so good I highly recommend
everything from Anita Hugh is because I
think I've read all of her books and I
just love them so much French coast was
just a wonderful raid and in my opinion
just like totally perfect for the summer
months as a beach read yes you need it
and then the last book I know we had so
many five star reviews in May it was
such a good month for chicle applause
but the last one is one that I reviewed
and it's the silver cord by Alison
caiola and if you've watched some of my
other videos I
so speak really highly of Allison and
her books the silver cord is booked two
in the lily Lockwood series the first
one is the seeds of a daisy which I
absolutely loved I gave that one five
stars it might be in my April bookish
faves I can't remember exactly which
month i reviewed that one in but such a
good book the silver cord was very
different from the seeds of a daisy but
amazing as well I kind of described it
as like Chiclets adventure because I
mean there's a lot of action going on
adventure there's a whole terrorist type
of scene happening in there but it's a
very exciting book it's very fast pace
and yes I definitely recommend both of
these books to you because they are
really really good so those are all of
the books that chocolate plus reviewed
in May that were given a five star
review either by me or my wonderful
review team these are the books that you
know we loved so much and we want
everyone else to be able to read so i
will have all of the links to all of the
books that i mentioned here in this
video i'll put the links to Chiclets
plus in the description box below as
well as their links to amazon i would
love to know if you've read any of these
books or if you have any of them like
coming up or if there's any that you
really want to get i would love to know
which books are kind of catching your
eye out there and if you haven't watched
my other mais favorites video i got the
idea from you guys that you guys want it
to see my book favorites from Chiclets
plus but then you were also wondering
about like the beauty favorites and all
that so I took your suggestions and I
made the two videos this month so you
can click like this link I think will be
like a link or something up here you can
click that and it'll take you to the
video of my may like random favourites
and I talked about beauty and lifestyle
nail polish food things like that that I
mentioned in there I did try to do music
and I'm super bummed because I filmed
like three of my favorite songs and it
was just like you know like 10 seconds
of each song and I was like
yeah Sean's and YouTube was like no you
can't put that out there I was like okay
but everybody else does so why don't I
get to so I tried to dispute it and it
didn't work I don't I have no idea
that's bizarre to me but if anyone has
any tips or ideas and how you put music
in your youtube videos like everyone
else does please let me know because I
love music so much so to not be able to
share my favorite songs with you on here
is just like that's really sad to me so
bummer guys do want to keep seeing these
favorites videos if you liked the idea
of having the two I think if I try to
like combine them together it would just
be like one SuperDuper long video so I
thought it would be better to make them
separate but if you like that idea
please leave a comment and let me know
or give this video a thumbs up so that I
know that you guys like them if you have
any other suggestions of videos that you
want to do I'm just getting ready to
start planning my July YouTube schedule
calendar and I'm getting some really
fantastic ideas from you guys of what
videos you want to see so if there's
anything in there that you want please
do comment below and let me know and I
will be taking note of that and I need
to stop rambling because we got to go so
until next time thanks guys for watching
