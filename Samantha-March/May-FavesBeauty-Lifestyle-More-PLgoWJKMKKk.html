going to be doing a may favorites video
and I decided to have two different may
favorites one is going to cover the book
favorites every review every book that
got a five star review on Chiclets plus
for the month prior I did one video like
that and I can link it below and people
seem to enjoy that it was asked to be
done again so I definitely will do that
but then people were kind of asking like
are you going to do some for the beauty
side as well and I thought I could do
book favorites and then kind of more my
random favourites it'll have like beauty
products and music and just kind of
whatever else i think is my favorite for
the month oh that's what i decided to do
for that so jumping into it my first two
products i mentioned these in a mini
haul video but it is the Maybelline fit
me matte and poreless foundation and
then also the maybelline fit me
concealer I these are just like such a
staple for me right now I'm always
reaching for them I'm always wearing
them I am kind of surprised how much I
really do like the matte and poreless
foundation because I'm not like a super
oily person and I wasn't totally sure
this would be needed and the first few
times I wore it I was actually mixing it
in with the regular Maybelline more of
like the dewy foundation because i
thought the mat would just be like too
much but i tried wearing it on my face
by itself just so i could make sure i
was giving it a fair review and i ended
up loving it and I just went to a
concert this past weekend and I wore
both the foundation and the concealer
and then I also i had just bought that
day the maybelline fit me Madame
poreless powder and I put the powder on
over it my makeup stayed in place all
night from five o'clock to one in the
morning in a sweaty venue with a ton of
people and mosh pits and craziness going
on my makeup still looked flawless at
the end of
I couldn't believe it I got home and
looked in the mirror to wash my makeup
off and it was like do I have to take it
off it still looks really good like what
so I'm still I've only used that powder
once so I can't like say for sure yet
that it's going to be my favorite but
i'm pretty sure you'll see it in the new
favorite video but yes the maybelline
matte and poreless foundation plus the
concealer loving both of those and then
keeping on the makeup trend to actually
have two products from ELF to talk about
one is the elf blush palette and I got
this in light and you can see this is
what the colors look like so it has four
different colors so if you can see the
mirror it's like a large mirror but it
does come with a big nice mirror and
then it's got the four shades as well
the brown one I do consider more of like
a bronzer shade and i use it for
bronzing but sometimes like this pink
shade I think can be really bright so
sometimes I put that pink on my brush
and then I put the bronzer my brush and
I kind of mix them together and I think
that makes like a really pretty glow but
this was six dollars at Target and I
think it's a great little palette I like
to travel with it I like the colors I
like that includes a bronzer so I reach
for this nearly every day and then also
from ELF I have their small tapered
brush so it just kind of has like this
dome top feature and what I use this for
is like setting my under eye concealer
so I'll just dab it like this and at
first what I was using for my under-eye
concealer it was like a big fluffy brush
because I just didn't have another brush
that I wasn't using for like foundation
or powder or bronzer or things like that
so I had one big brush and I was using
but I wasn't really getting like I
wasn't setting the concealer I wasn't
really getting my transition powder in
there and so I bought this brush and
it's like super cheap itself so it's
very affordable like maybe it was three
dollars at target
and I would dip it in my translucent
powder had it under my under eyes and
the very first time I used it I was like
this made a huge difference I really
brightened up my under eyes and they
kept my concealer in place and I'm so so
happy i bought this if you don't have
any sort of small tapered brush for your
under-eye concealer i highly suggest you
get one because i thought it worked
really well and i think i have just one
more beauty product to go over and it is
nail polish and this is the sally hansen
hard as nails xtreme wear and the color
is 405 coral reef and this nail polish
so i actually bought this last year but
why I'm including it in my may favorites
video is because I've been on a huge
like nail kick lately and I just keep
painting my nails probably cuz i'm
recording his videos and the first few
ones i don't have nail polish on and I'm
like mm no paint your nails but i went
to walgreens other day and I was picking
up a bunch of different nail polishes
and I picked up this color I was like
this coral color is just beautiful and I
watch on the store and I was buying a
few different things and I kept looking
at it and I was like do I have that
color I feel like maybe I either have
eye color or I have a really similar
color and so I put it down and I ended
up buying something else about like a
purple nail polish but I came home and
checked and sure enough same exact nail
polish that I picked up two years in a
row almost bought it I'm glad I
remembered at the last minute but
clearly this one really stuck out to me
so this is coral reef from the sally
hansen hard as nails xtreme where I love
Sally Hansen's nail polishes I think
they're amazing they last a really long
time I think so this is going to be like
my go-to spring summer color I can just
tell another thing that I'm loving but I
no longer have the packaging for it
threw it away but if you watched my
perfectly posh video I mentioned the
snarky bar from them which is like a
body wash bar but it has like
exfoliating beads on it you guys I am
still using that
and still absolutely in love with it if
you haven't heard a perfectly posh i
will link my video below cuz i kind of
explained about the company and i gave
an overview of a few products that i was
sent for review and the snarky bar by
far is the one that stood out to me the
most and i absolutely loved it i'm
talking about this bar to like everybody
because it just i just love it so much i
can't say enough good things about the
smoky bar it feels so good when you were
in the shower and you're using that to
not only wash your body but like
exfoliated at the same time and with
summer coming I couldn't have got it at
a better time I absolutely love it so
the snarky bar from perfectly posh left
and then another thing that is my
favorite and it's kind of random and
it's also bookish at the same time but
in May the cover for my fourth novel was
released and I've kind of talked about
it a little bit in some of my past
videos but the book is called up to i do
and it's about a girl who's getting
married and I had an idea to use one of
my own wedding photos on a book cover
when we got engaged and we were going to
the process of getting married I had the
idea like wouldn't be so cool if I could
take one of my own wedding photos and
use them in a book cover and I was able
to do that and i'm really happy i don't
have the actual physical book to show
you yet because as of this moment in
time it is still in proofreading so i
won't have the actual physical copy of
it until this summer when it actually
get releases but i do have something
that i can show you guys and this is the
picture that is used for my book cover
if you guys can see that um so it's this
actual picture that's used as my book
cover and I when the pictures came back
our photographer actually posted like a
teaser post on Facebook and it had a few
different pictures in it and this
picture was one of them and I just
thought it was like I saw it and I knew
right away I was like that has to be my
cover I just know it so
you guys are seeing this okay this is
just a book that has like a few of our
different wedding pictures in it but the
cover is what ended up being the cover
of up to i do so once i have a release
date for the book i'll be sure to let
you guys know because i'm really excited
for this one though it's it has my
wedding picture on the cover it's really
nothing like my wedding it's two
extremely wealthy families marrying into
each other which is not quite me and my
husband but I I just think that book is
going to be really special to me because
it's dedicated to my late grandmother
and it has my wedding picture on the
cover so thought that was very cool and
i'll be sure to let you guys know when
that comes out and another thing i have
to talk about is like kind of superb
random but i'm totally in love with
these and if you follow me on social
media I'm like talking about them and
sharing pictures of them but it is these
dull smoothie shakers you guys can see
that but it's just like the one I
grabbed out of the freezer this is peach
mango and basically it's got real frozen
fruit and yogurt in it and what you do
is you just put juice in it I put orange
juice in it and it has like a line that
will tell you like how far you fill it
and if you want it thicker or thinner
consistency like how much juice to pour
in it and voila you have a smoothie I
love smoothies and I drink so many
smoothies in the summer but a lot of
times my problem is I don't want to get
the blender out I don't want to clean
the fruit I don't want to cut the fruit
I don't want to blend everything
together I don't want to then clean the
blender because I want to make another
smoothie the next day like it's just too
time consuming for me I work in
freelance and my time is my money so
when I'm wasting time doing other things
and I'm not working and I'm not making
money it's just like I don't like it I
want to be working instead of thinking
about food and whatnot but I also don't
want to
like crap especially in the summer when
I'm gonna swim said a lot going to pools
and on the water and all that fun stuff
so these are like saving my life I think
they're really really good too I
actually they have like these regular
ones where they're like peach mango
strawberry banana strawberry but then
they have other ones that have
vegetables in them too like red beet is
one that I know that's in there I can't
think of what other vegetables that they
mix in with them but even those i think
the taste is still super delicious and i
actually feel like I fill the lineup
pretty far because hey I do like the
thinner consistencies I don't like
chunky smoothies if that makes sense but
then also I think they're so good I'm
drinking every last drop that I can get
in there I just throw straw in here with
it and I absolutely love them so i think
they are a little bit high and sugar
like I think this one has like 12 grams
of sugar in it which I do understand is
kind of higher but for me personally
what I would eat for breakfast is like
sugary cereals like Froot Loops I love
fruit loops or I will drink coffee are
all going to McDonald's and get
breakfast so between all of those I kind
of think this is going to be the lesser
evil and I'm still getting my fruits and
even sometimes vegetables so really into
these super easy to make those are all
of my may kind of like Beauty lifestyle
random music favorites be on the lookout
because I will be recording the May
bookish favorites here shortly and I
will have that video up for you if you
want to keep seeing more of like these
types of my favorite videos please give
this video a thumbs up and let me know
and I will continue to keep making them
but I don't think I have anything else
to say so I will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
