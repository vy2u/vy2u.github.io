thanks for stopping by today's video I'm
going to be talking all about the
Maybelline better skin foundation but
before I jump into the review and the
swatches and all that good stuff I do
have to apologize I am like severely
under the weather I don't know if you
can tell by my voice are like my eyes
keep watering it even hurts to like look
up I suffer really badly from a seasonal
allergies and we are in that season
right now and unfortunately I knew I
needed to record a video and I also
needed to walk my dog I thought what
should i do first I took her outside and
clearly that was a mistake because now I
feel like I can barely breathe but once
again we are leaving this weekend and I
really wanted to get this video up
before we do leave takes me a few days
to edit so this is where I am how did
you shout twice a year it's usually in
march in September but I mean it's
almost September I get it tomorrow so I
just couldn't wait any longer so I'm so
sorry that my voice is crazy my eyes are
probably wild I really can't wear any
eyeliner I don't know how I'm pulling
off mascara right now but I tried to
make myself look someone human for you
guys especially because this is a beauty
video and I'm like today's video is
going to be all about the Maybelline
better skin foundation and if you would
like to see my thoughts on it then
please just keep watching up today's
show is Maybelline New York superstay
better skin skin transforming foundation
whoa this is what the product looks like
i did mention this in a previous haul
video because i actually got it from
Influenster if you are not familiar with
influenster i'll link that video
somewhere up in here down below and i
will also leave a link to the
influenster website in the description
box influenster is basically for anyone
who really has a social media presence
you can sign up there and they ask you
they have like little questionnaires
that will ask you you know what your
interests are what your passions are
what you talked about on social media
and then every once in a while I don't
know how often they do these boxes but
they have what's called a box box and
they send a certain amount out to
a specific audience so because I am a
beauty blogger I answer a lot of the
beauty questions I have badges for their
beauty queen profiles and things like
that I get sent a beauty box box and I
was sent the 14 Maybelline so what it is
is that we get a product we are supposed
to try it out and then review it so I
left my review on Amazon and then I'm
also doing a review here I submitted to
influenster so they know that I kept up
my part of the deal so that keeps me in
the running for future box boxes but
then like with the Maybelline one if you
complete all the challenges which is
basically reviewing I know we had to
take a selfie with the product on
Instagram if you complete all the
challenges then you are entered to win
big tote bag i think is the Maybelline
prize filled with other Maybelline
products so if you do everything you get
entered in a drawing to win and so many
people win a larger prize is a little
bit about influencer again links will be
below if you want to know more
information or to sign up for it so a
little bit about the product mine is
like super dirty because I just used it
is what I have on my face today I've
been using it solely for almost three
weeks and that was kind of when we got
the box it said this is your three weeks
skin challenge you know use this for
three weeks and I really pretty much
have been not only because i said i was
going to and i was trying to give it a
fair shot but because i really ended up
enjoying it so this is what it looks
like it's this blue bottle it's very
similar to the other Maybelline products
except this one has a pump on it so this
makes it different from the Maybelline
ah like fit me foundations that you have
to pour it out onto your hand this one
has a pump which i think is incredible
I'm all about the pump life that I got
was 25 nude beige and when you filled
out the form on influenster for Hayes
possibility that you're going to get
this box box answer a few of these
questions they had you pick out a shade
right there this I don't even know if
this was in our drug stores yet I had
not seen this product as of yet I mean
this was a few months back that we
filled out the survey so I had really no
idea and I was trying to look at the
I agree i'm like what color do i think
best suits me so i went with the 25 nude
beach first impressions I got it and I
thought I like the packaging I like the
blue I like that there's a pump yes
we're going good got upstairs to my
bathroom and I pumped it out into my
hand and I had a few first impression
thoughts that weren't so great one I
thought it came out really really thick
and I was like oh is this going to be
easy to blend on my hand the second one
was I thought it smelled extremely funny
it smells a lot like chemicals to me
which I don't particularly like
especially what I'm putting something on
my face it just had a very strong sent
to me and third I was like well this
colors just not going to match me at all
I kind of rubbed it into my hand a
little bit and was like well there goes
that idea but I gave it a fair shot I
put it on I'm happy to say that even
though it does come out of the pump
quite thick it was very easy to blend
pretty much solely apply my foundation
with the Sigma flat kabuki the f80 brush
so it's just this flat foundation brush
that's also very dirty because I used it
today this is pretty much what I apply
foundation less sometimes I'll use my
Beauty Blender but most times i'm using
the f80 and i didn't have any sort of
problems I didn't think it like caked up
anywhere I didn't think it was blotchy
or anything using my regular brush that
I do for every foundation I thought it
applied really nicely I also didn't
think the smell stayed around thankfully
because I really did not like that smell
once I actually have it on my face I
didn't notice anything funky about it
honestly what surprised me the most was
the color because I thought there's just
no way this color is way too light for
me especially in the summertime
especially because I've been tanning I
don't know what it is but it's like you
put it on your face and in a few minutes
it almost like its skin matched me it
was bizarre and because I didn't hear
anything about that with this you know
there's some I think it's all may that
had like a BB cream or something where
when you squeezed it out it came out
white but then when you put it on your
skin it was supposed to match your skin
tone I didn't see that this one was
supposed to have anything like that but
honestly I thought the color worked fine
I have it on today i will say that i
usually wear some sort of bronzer
with it just to bronze it up I don't
typically wear this on its own though I
have and I thought it worked fine but
for me and for my preference and
especially for the summertime I like to
have a little bit more of liked and
glowy skin going on so I wear bronzer
with it but honestly I was super
surprised so I'm not saying go out and
buy a super light shade and like it's
going to look good on you I think maybe
this is like a shade too light for me
and it just worked out good enough for
me so I was pretty pleased with the
three things that I was worried about
upon my first impression turned out to
be not a big deal also say it does say
that it has titanium dioxide sunscreen
and with an SPF 15 is also say that it
is oil free all day color wear with a CT
ylc known for its antioxidant benefits I
am not totally positive what axtell see
is knockin all I don't know what that is
it improves skin look in three weeks
reduces the appearance of spots bumps
dullness and redness dermatologist
tested for safety well there you go kind
of another thing about this is that
they're saying if you use it for three
weeks your skin is supposed to visibly
improve to me that's a pretty bold
statement for a foundation because you
know our skin depends on a lot of
different things what we eat our daily
activities of her in the Sun hit do we
wear our makeup to bed or you work out
in our makeup if there's a lot of
different factors that go into what your
skin looks like so to say that just a
foundation will do that is pretty wild
to me i will say that i haven't wearing
it for the three weeks do I think my
skin is noticeably better I don't think
so and it said it would get rid of like
redness and bumps I don't think that's
the case either because I had a really
wicked breakout on my chin not that long
ago and that red bump is still there
that I still have to cover with
concealer every single day so I don't
know about that but I also don't expect
my foundation to act like my skincare
routine not going to lie that's not what
I think of when I come to foundation I
want to wear something that is going to
look good on me that's going to feel
comfortable on me and it's gone
to last in with that last point in mind
this sucker lasts all day I'm not
kidding and I put it up against some
extreme elements you know not only did I
put it on in the morning and sure i SAT
around my house I watched my dog or
maybe went out to dinner with my husband
and my foundation looked fine I wore
this I put this foundation on at about
eight-thirty am one day drove to chicago
from clinton iowa it was maybe like a
four-hour car drive drove to chicago
went to a baseball game it was like 98
degrees at game time we were in the
bleacher seats we were in the Sun it was
hot we were sweating or just dripping in
sweat it was kind of disgusting after
that got over we took the subway back or
the L or train or whatever you call it
in chicago i live in I don't know what
it's called we're all crammed in like
sardines everyone's sweating because
we're all still so hot we went out in
Chicago that night went out to dinner
took my makeup off at the hotel at maybe
1231 am so that's being put on at 830am
going through all of that being outside
being in the heat being in extreme
weather being around a ton of other
people to not taking it off till 1am and
I did not do any sort of touch-up when
we went out for dinner in Chicago I look
I applied more eyeliner and probably
some more highlighter because I feel
like that's something that I would do I
didn't do anything with my face I didn't
do more foundation or blush or anything
like that in it lasted and it looks
great I still thought I looked good at
the end of the night I was like oh your
makeup still looks good girl as I'm
taking it off like oh are we still I
sure we're saying it we don't need to do
anything else because I still look good
I was really really impressed with the
lasting power of this I'm not gonna lie
if you are looking for something that
will last you all day if you know you
have something where you're going to
leave your house in the morning you're
not going to be back till late at night
you're probably not going to be a little
touch up your makeup a lot this really
will last you all day i was so impressed
with that so really on a whole with all
of those factors put in there i I mean
how I said that I was reaching for it
not only because I said yes I'll take
the three weeks and test it out but
because I honestly really really like
this foundation and I would definitely
recommend it my overall thoughts on the
foundation
and you know of course I I'm saying how
much i like it and i really do recommend
it but i kind of wanted to show you guys
like it up against a few other
foundations so you can see you know a
breakdown of some of the other drugstore
foundations once i grabbed from my
collection to show you i have the
maybelline fit me foundation and then i
have the maybelline fit me matte and
poreless foundation and then i also have
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation
starting with the Maybelline ones you
can see that the packaging is pretty
similar so these are the three
altogether this one is thinner and a
little bit taller you can see that it's
just a little bit taller but these are
the same amount of product they each
have one fluid ounce and both the other
Maybelline products have the one fluid
ounce the difference is that I pointed
out is that this one has the pump the
other two maybelline fit me do not have
a pump so you have to literally pour it
out into your hand some other
differences with this one the matte and
poreless does not have an SPF which is
good if you know you're going to be in
around a lot of flash photography
throughout the day you don't want SPF
because it will reflect the light and
kind of give your face that like white
glowy look so the matte and poreless
does not have SPF the regular fit me
does have SPF 18 and then the better
skin has SPF 15 so these two both do
have SPF I honestly don't think I really
noticed a huge problem with this when I
wore it during the baseball game because
we were taking pictures left and right
and you know just having a great time I
really didn't notice much of a
difference I will say when I know that
I'm going to be taking a lot of pictures
I do this matte and poreless because
your face really does look flawless in
pictures and you have no white bright
scariness happening at all but I didn't
notice that much of a difference when
using this one bring it to the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi let's see they each have
the one fluid ounce and they
to come with a pump this is what the
pump looks like that true Muslim we does
have SPF 20 and then again the
Maybelline better scan foundation has
the SPF 15 so you get a little bit more
SPF with this one I will say the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi I mean honestly it kind
of does remind me of the Maybelline
regular fit me but it really does make
your skin dewey and luminous i mean if
that's the look that you're going for
this is a really good foundation to have
is our maybelline better scan foundation
and the L'Oreal True Match Lumi side by
side as well I'm also going to do some
swatches so you guys can see the colors
I don't know if this will show up great
on my camera and also plan to do
swatches of this on my snapchat so if
you don't follow me on snapchat I'll
leave my name like up in here I'm just
samantha dot March there is a dot period
in between my name so Samantha dot March
and I will plan to do some snapchats
with all these swatches again the day
that the video that this video goes live
so oh this is like one little pump of
the Maybelline better skin foundation if
you can just see that like it comes out
kind of like in like this thick glob and
i'll do the L'Oreal True Match Lumi over
here okay so if you can tell with this
one again I don't know if you really
will be able to but this one is like
almost like runny and it doesn't it
comes out thin and almost like on the
runny side with the Maybelline fit me so
this is a little bit harder because they
don't have to pump so I'm going to have
to actually pour some into my hand but
uh but this one right here is the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless and
that one it comes out kind of thick and
that's the first difference i noticed
from the regular fit me to the matte and
poreless as i thought the mountain
forest came out thicker but it still
doesn't come out as thick as the better
skin that's the thickest formula I've
seen so far then this one over here is
the regular Maybelline fit me so those
are the four and then
was just going to kind of blend these in
so you guys can see them so these are
the four swatched on my hand so this one
starting on this side this is the
Maybelline better skin foundation in 25
nude beige to it is the regular
maybelline fit me foundation and that is
in shade 230 next to it over here is the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
that's also in shade 2 30 and then the
far one is the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
and that shade is w5 sand beige so those
are these swatches of the four that I
have to show you I would say the
maybelline butter skin I mean honestly
it really they all are very different I
would say the better skin is definitely
lighter except mentioned I thought it
was a shade too light for me it's
probably the lightest one followed by
the l'oreal true match usually when i
wear the l'oreal true match i bought
that back in like the fall winter time
when I wasn't asked hands so that's
probably fits me for fall winter weather
here in Iowa and then these two in the
middle the two other maybelline's I can
definitely tell that the matte poreless
is a thicker consistency even on my skin
the regular is more easily to blend but
the colors are pretty similar again the
shades were both 230 but they are just
slightly different from the different
formulations so those are a few spots on
my hands to kind of give you idea kind
of give you a color idea I really hope
that helps some of you if you are
looking to buy a foundation but you
wanted to see some of the other
drugstore foundations and compared to it
and see the different swatches so that's
why I did it for you I just pulled all
the other drugstore foundations I didn't
do anything like BB creams or tinted
moisturizers or anything like that that
I have around my house I wanted to do
foundations so yeah I hope that part
helped you guys out because I know that
part is what really helps me out when I
watch other videos I'd like to be able
to see the colors and see the swatches
here how they compare especially if it's
a foundation of course that I have so I
can kind of compare it in my head before
I buy it okay so I think that's going to
wrap up this product review video if you
guys have any other questions on the
Maybelline better skin foundation or
even on something like influencer please
just comment below and let me know and I
will as always be happy to answer those
for you I really hope this review helped
you I have been seeing a lot more lately
about this foundation because it seems
that it's getting to be pretty loved
I've seen even some other bigger
youtubers starting to mention it as well
and I really did think it was a great
product say if I had to rate it on a
scale of one to five I just put my
review on Amazon the other night I gave
it a 4 which to me is pretty good it's
not a foundation that is going to change
my life on to compare it to the other
three foundations that I had mentioned I
still think the maybelline fit me matte
and poreless is my favorite one just I
love the way it goes on I love the way
it looks and I love the way it stays on
and how it looks in pictures but this
one is just so closely behind really do
recommend this a whole lot i hope the
swatches and seeing the different shades
help you guys out think that's all I
have left to say I hope I didn't miss
anything as always I'm gonna go and put
a washcloth on my face and maybe it's
some ice cream because I'm feeling like
crap you guys but I just really wanted
to get this video recorded and up for
you I really hope you enjoyed it you
learn something new maybe you found a
new product that you want to try whether
it be the better skin or any of the
other drugstore foundations that I
