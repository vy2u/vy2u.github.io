I was like I'm all excited already whoa
let's hey guys today I'm going to be
doing a mini drugstore haul and review
for you I went to walgreens the other
day and they were having a sale it was
like Maybelline Revlon lore'l and I
think maybe cover girl they were all buy
one get one half off and I was like what
do i do like do i buy all of them that
would probably extreme and Maybelline
was so walgreens has like some rewards
card out there now and so it was buy one
get one half off for Maybelline but also
if you purchased fifteen dollars or more
of Maybelline then you got like three
thousand bonus points on your card
whatever I was like done there's
actually a lot that I've been wanting to
get from Maybelline I've been seeing
some really awesome reviews for some of
their new products and so I thought well
perfect I know that I will at least
spend the fifteen dollars and life will
be good so it took me a little bit to
decide which products I was going to go
with but with these three little
products can you see them all here they
are it's a primer a concealer and then
also a foundation so I'm just going to
kind of give my feedback I have all of
them on my face right now and I've worn
them for a few days now so I could kind
of test them out and give you my
opinions but I'll just kind of start in
the order that we go with so first would
be the primer and I got its by their
face studio which is like their new
fancy schmancy line apparently and I
think they had three different primers
and then they each kind of did something
different there was like a blur and
smooth and a photo finish but this one
is the blur and Alou
Nate so it's kind of got like this is
like pink I don't know if the camera
will pick it up but it's the pink one
and I don't have any illuminating
primers which is why I went with this
one and I've had my eye on a few and
just with summer coming up some I don't
sometimes I don't like to wear a lot of
foundation in the summer so I thought if
I can just like put a primer on and
it'll kind of blur out any imperfections
but then kind of like help my face have
that summary glow that'll be good so
this is when I picked up and if i put
some on my hand it does kind of come out
pink if you guys can see that and then
just rub it into your skin and it is
kind of illuminating since I record on
my phone I don't have a viewfinder so I
can't actually like look and see if what
exactly it is that you're seeing but try
to make that work but I found so far I
actually think it does eliminate my skin
I can tell when I wear it so I like that
part and it smells like like it smells
it smells good I think smells good it
doesn't smell like really chemical e or
anything like that so I like the way it
smells I think it illuminates the base
which is what it says it's going to do
so far I think it's a pretty good primer
from when I put the foundation on over
it i think it holds everything in place
really well I've tried to use it as a
primer and a lot of times when i finish
my makeup I'll do like a makeup setting
spray over it and I've tried not to do
the setting spray for a few times just
because I wanted to see like how this
really lasted throughout the day and so
far I'm really impressed I really like
it I think it does its job I think it
says what it says it's going to do and
because i really like primers especially
for the summer time and this has SPF 30
in it and i think the other ones do too
i'll probably pick up a few more this is
kind of pricey for the drugstore del i
think it was like eleven or twelve
dollars and I was like oh ok so kind of
price here for
drug the store but next one I got is the
fit me concealer the maybelline fitme
concealer did I already say that these
are all from Maybelline I did right I've
not yet so this is the fit me concealer
you guys can take a look really wanting
this concealer I got it in the shade
light I've been really wanting this
because I've been hearing people say
that it's like a pretty good dupe for
NARS like radiant creamy concealer and
so I thought okay let's just give it a
shot because the Norris one is super
expensive and this one wasn't I can't
remember the price maybe like six
dollars it's kind of what it looks like
on the skin and then I just kind of rub
it in it blends out really well and when
they say this was creamy yeah this is
creamy like I could tell immediately
once I took it out that's what the
applicator looks like I could
immediately tell i was going to love
this concealer and it goes on so well i
have it around my under eyes today I
thought it covered everything really
well I use a Beauty Blender a damp
beauty blender to blend out the
concealer and I thought it was super
easy to blend out it covered everything
really well I liked so my shade is light
because I really like to brighten up my
under eyes so I usually tend to go with
a light shade I I really like this
concealer again it's the fit me
concealer really inexpensive I've never
used the NARS so I can't actually tell
you if I think it's a dupe but other
people say it is and I really enjoy it I
I reach for this a lot now last one is
this new fit me matte and poreless
foundation and I got the shade 230 now
I've been hearing a lot of good things
about this asana to get it especially
for the summer I kind of have like
normal skin I don't have really oily
skin I don't have really dry skin but in
the summertime I can definitely tell
that i get Dewey faster and wat side a
lot and things like that so I thought if
I can kind of start bringing more matte
into my collection it's probably a good
thing and one thing that I have been
doing I have the
regular fit me concealer and this is
like more of the Dewey kind and I
thought this was really good for the
winter this is like my favorite
foundation like this is what I reach for
every day and that has SPF 18 in it I
don't think this one has SPF the matte
and poreless doesn't have SPF which kind
of stinks because I'm really all about
protecting my face from the Sun can you
guys hear my dog she's going crazy she
really wants in the office sorry Oh what
I have been doing is actually mixing
these two so mixing the Dewey and mixing
the mat and I think that looks really
good on me but I wanted to be able to
give like a fair review so i've been
using just the mat for the past few days
and i really love it I'm i always get so
concerned about buying drugstore
foundations and what shade to do and i
just kind of picked this one at random
and I think the shade works really well
for me it's a little bit darker so it
kind of gives me a little bit of a
darker look so I'm not so pale all I sit
here in Iowa and fries because it's
really cold still but it goes on really
well the coverage I for some reason I
thought when I would do like a matte
foundation as afraid oh it almost makes
me look like a doll or I don't know I
just I heard Matt and I kind of got
worried but I like seriously I think
this one is super good I have actually I
have two from the regular collection
because that's how much I loved it like
I went out and bought more in there in
different shades one's a little bit
darker ones a little bit lighter
sometimes I mix these so i'll probably
end up buying more of the matte and
poreless too just because that's how i
roll maybe they'll be another special
love specials but honestly I couldn't be
happier with this little mini haul I
loved every single product I really only
have good things to say about them I
think Maybelline is killing it I have a
few of their other products that I can
maybe do even like a whole Maybelline
product review but I loving their
products they're so much more affordable
than some of the higher
and products if you can find at your
drug stores they're doing any sort of
specials or you have your rewards cards
that's amazing so all three all three
definitely get come over here give a
thumbs up from me so if you're going to
be at a drugstore and you're looking for
a few of those certain products give
them a shot see if they're on sale maybe
pick them up if you do have any of the
products and you have opinions about
them you like them you don't like them
you're not sure about it or if you have
any particular questions below just go
ahead and leave a comment I will try to
answer them for you if you like this
video please give it a thumbs up if you
want to see me do a few more makeup
halls because I will only be so happy to
go shopping for you guys I mean I would
do that for you you're welcome but yeah
