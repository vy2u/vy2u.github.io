video I'm going to be talking about the
morphe 35c pallets of morphe 35o palette
i recently mentioned in my morphe haul
that i would be doing this video giving
my full review on the palate doing
swatches for you and a makeup tutorial
and that day is here and in depth on the
palette and then also showing you how i
got this makeup look using the 35 t
palette so why don't we just get to
doing the tutorial I apologize I I was
trying to think today as I was getting
ready to film this video I was trying to
think of the last day that I saw
sunshine and I can't remember when that
day was it is so just dark and gloomy
we've had nothing but rain which I guess
was better than snow but I'm just like
hating all of these videos that I'm
putting out because I just hate the
quality of them I am happy to say I
mentioned in my last video that I was
looking for a new camera and I bought
one it is on its way to me I got the
Canon t5i I believe from Target it was
on sale I bought it so I'm super excited
to be able to get that in I won't have
until next week but it's coming then I
just gotta figure out my lighting and
we're gonna get there we're gonna get
there slowly but surely into it so of
course i'm using the morphe 35 t palette
so again here's what all the shades look
like okay so honestly I'm sitting down I
kind of have like an idea in mind but
not a firm one so first I'm gonna go in
with this brown shade it's on the bottom
now these don't have names so sorry they
don't have specific names go in and
place this one in my crease with a big
fluffy brush this is from BH Cosmetics
it's like my favorite crease brush ever
and I'm just going to put that in the
crease as my transition shade
I just go back and forth in windshield
wiper motions I concentrate it in the
crease and then up versus down so I
blend it up towards my eyebrow next I'm
gonna go in with this like mauve shade
right here hope you guys can see that
I'm so excited to have a real camera
that has a viewfinder on it so I can see
myself what I'm doing it's gonna be
great it's gonna be great it's gonna
take me a little bit to figure out but
it's gonna be great once we get there
I'm going to take the Sigma blending
brush this is the e25 and I'm going to
put a little bit of that on my brush and
then I'm going to put that into the
crease as well and focus it mainly on
the outer V of my eye and then slowly as
less product is on my brush I'm going to
start to drag it more towards the inner
corner of my eye
so on I'm going to go back a few times
and put more product on my brush and
then blend it in I mean to get it to the
darkness that I want it so what if you
guys are repeating this look you can
just do it as many times as you want it
okay and then just to charging it up a
little bit more I'm going to take this
shade right here another one of the
taupe shade and just my same Sigma brush
to pick up just a little bit of product
on mag and again apply it in the outer V
and this one I'm basically going to only
do on the outer V of my eye I'm not
really going to drag it in to the inner
part of my eye at all
and again that's why don't where you can
come in as many times as you want and to
make the color as deep as you want as
dark as you want but then once that is
done I'm going to take just a clean
we're going to take a clean blending
brush this is the g13 from morphe it's
they're blending fluff and no product on
it and I'm just gonna blend everything
together I say too I forgot to mention
at the beginning but I have like my
foundation on blush on all that good
stuff and I did prime my eyes with my
instant age rewind concealer and I said
it with the laura mercier secret
brightening powder so really the only
thing I had tough to do is just the eye
makeup and then also do the lipstick
because I thought it would look kind of
weird to like have everything done
including your lipstick and not your
eyes like once I put the lipstick on I
was like too much too much so we'll do
that at the end too and moving on to the
lid shade I'm going to take this flat
shader brush is from BH Cosmetics and
I'm going to spray that with a little
bit of the mac fix+
a lot of people say with the morphe
shadows that you don't need anything
like the mac fix+
or anything like that because the
shadows are just so pigmented on their
own I agree with that to an extent but
if you really want your eyeshadows to
pop and if you really want them I feel
to be like longer-lasting then I
recommend using like mac fix+ or some
sort of similar spray to this because to
me it just really helped take a I shadow
that pops and then made it pop you know
I'm saying so I'm just going to spray my
brush however that I'm going to be using
is right here on the top it's like a
shimmery light purple type shade I just
love the shimmery shades in this palette
like they're so gorgeous it's going to
pop that shade all over my eyelid
I really hope the camera is picking up
the shade because I just think it's
gorgeous
okay once I have that done I'm just
gonna go back in with the g13 from
morphe and just blend everything
together again just to make it so
there's no harsh edges at all then I'm
going to move on to eyeliner I'm going
to be using the Maybelline master
graphic eyeliner that's what it looks
like it's a little bit different so I'm
going to do just I think like a regular
winged liner but honestly it is so hard
for me to do on camera I've done on
camera a couple other times if you guys
want to see how I do my eyeliner I'll
have like the videos up here and I'll
have a link in the description box below
but I'm gonna do this one off camera
mostly because I know I'm going
somewhere after I filmed this tutorial
and I don't want to like have to do over
or have it be like not what I wanted at
all so I'm gonna do it on camera just
make off-camera to make sure I get it
the way I want it but y'all leave those
other tutorials below where I do with
the liner on camera and then kind of
keeping with like the purple theme we
have going on I'm going to use the cream
gel liner pencil from colour-pop and
this is in the shade crybaby and I just
did a whole video about the liners but I
got from colour-pop I love crybaby it's
like a it's like a violet like a light
violet but it's very bright so I just
thought it would work well for this look
so I'm going to be putting this in my
waterline
then for the lower lashlines I'm going
to come in with this flat definer brush
it's from BH Cosmetics and I'm going to
use the first taupe shade that I used in
my crease and I'm just going to smudge
that on my lower lash line really close
to my lash and then using this large
pencil brush also from BH Cosmetics I'm
going to go in with the last shade that
I used in my crease and then I'm going
to smudge that as well on my lower lash
line
ize I'm going to be using the Too Faced
better than sex mascara this is my
little mini version that I got but I
also do have the full size two
and I know thinks this would be a fun
look to use false eyelashes with just
because I know that I'm going somewhere
after this and I don't really want to
wear fake eyelashes where I'm going I'm
not going to use lashes today but I
think eyelashes would look great with
this look if I was going somewhere like
holiday party or things like that I
would probably wear my lashes but to
finish off the look I'm going to be
using a trap from colour-pop and this is
one of their new ultra matte liquid
lipsticks or it was in my new colour-pop
haul anyways and it's just like a grey
mauve shade so I feel like it fits in
pretty well with this look and it's one
of my favorites from them like I can't
stop wearing it I can't in a lot of
times with these liquid lipsticks I
don't use eyeliner or eyeliner I don't
use eyeliner I don't use a lip liner
it's in below because I feel like they
don't need it and they don't go anywhere
if you have a favorite lip liner feel
free to use it I find myself not needing
lip liners with these
okay so this is the morphe 35c palette
it has the 35c sticker here on the back
and then this is what the shades look
like so it is a taupe palette it has a
lot of the taupe shade smoth shades it
has matte shades it has shimmer shades
it's gorgeous
like when I first got the morphe palette
I was using it a lot because I was
trying to see the different makeup looks
I was trying to test out a lot of the
different shadows but then even after
that I kept reaching for it and my poor
like Kat Von D shade and light palette
it was like what about me like what are
we doing over here and I'm like sorry I
love this one so much it has I mean it
has 35 shades in there which is a lot
and they are big shades like if you can
tell like these are these are not small
eyeshadow is that you're getting and you
get 35 of them there's definitely more
shimmer shades than there are matte
shades but for matte shades you have
like the taupe matte shades you have
brown you have light brown I mean for
like perfect transition colors I feel
like and then these shimmery colors are
just so beautiful I'm using one on my
lid today that I just thought was so
stunning I will say and in the makeup
tutorial I will use mac fix+ a spray to
help like bring out the pigment in the
eyeshadows I've been watching a lot of
videos on morphe and a lot of people are
saying like you don't need mac fix+ or
anything because the shadows already so
pigmented and I do agree with that but I
do like to use the mac fix+ because i
think it makes them even more pigmented
and i almost think it makes them last
longer too like it keeps that pigment
bright all throughout like the event
that I'm doing so you know if I'm if I
know that I'm not really doing anything
that day but I still do my makeup a lot
of times I'll skip the mac fix+ if I'm
using the shimmery shade but if I know
that I'm going somewhere I'm going to be
out all night I'll use it I just think
it really like amps the shadows up a
notch but again they are very pigmented
on their own with having so many shadows
in here there are so many different
looks you can do I do
no if I have repeated a look and when I
sat down to do today's makeup tutorial I
had an idea in mind on a look that was
like one of my very first looks that I
did with this palette I was so excited
to use like two of the matte taupe
shades a little bit of brown in my
crease and then a shimmer shade on my
lid and I had done that that look before
like previously not on camera or
anything but I did that look and I
thought that I would do it again and
then as I sat down and I was looking at
it I was like wait I haven't used this
shadow yet and it looks so beautiful I
really want to use that shadow so that's
what I went with but I mean there is
just so many different combinations that
you can do with this palette it was 22
and 99 when I purchased it from the
morphe website which for 35 big
eyeshadows I think is fantastic
I was very happy with it there's always
like discount codes floating out around
there a lot of the bigger youtubers are
affiliates with morphe so I personally
used a discount code when I put my
purchase in I think I got 15% off my
entire order so I ordered the palette
and then for brushes as well
I got 15% off everything so they're
definitely on the affordable side which
I just think is so fabulous they have a
lot of different palettes out there for
you guys to choose from the 3500 is
probably the most loved palette from
morphe and it's always sold out I
believe it is still sold out as the time
that I'm filming I think they brought it
back in stock and then it sold out again
in like a half hour so but they have a
lot of other ones out there they're
bringing out new ones it seems like
quite frequently so if you guys really
want an eye shadow palette but maybe
can't afford some of the more expensive
ones like the Kat Von D and Anasazi had
things like that I definitely suggest
looking at morphe because so far I have
been so happy with these eyeshadows and
find myself reaching for this palette a
lot
I think I got everything covered in this
a morphe palette review swatch makeup
tutorial demo i hope you guys enjoyed
this video I have a lot of fun filming
it for you even with the crappy weather
we have going on still had a good time
filming this for you please do give this
a thumbs up if you liked this video if
you guys have anything from morphe
pallets or brushes but if you have any
favorites for more for you please leave
them in the comments below because I
will want to be placing another morphe
order I'm trying to decide I think I
want to get another palette but I'm not
exactly positive which one to get but
just because of how much I love this
palette I feel like having another one
couldn't really come in handy like
because I need it why do i why do I feel
like I need to make excuses to why I'm
going to buy another palette it was only
23 dollars I'm sure I can find a
discount code maybe for Christmas I'll
do it but yes please leave in the
comments below if you have anything from
morphe that you really love that you
think I should get or anyone else
watching this video it should get he'll
be a little subscribe before you go and
