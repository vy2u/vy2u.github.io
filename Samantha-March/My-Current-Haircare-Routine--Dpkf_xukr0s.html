video is going to be on my hair care
routine I recently did my skincare
routine video and I can put that
somewhere up in this area for you to
click on in view if you're interested in
seeing about my skin care but then some
people were also saying you know why
don't you do your hair care as well so
that is what I'm going to do today I'm
just going to kind of go over the
products that I use the shampoo and
conditioners that are my right that are
in my shower any like after shower care
that I use in my hair or any like
Springs products things like that that i
use and just give some of my hair tips
along the way it's kind of hilarious
because if you were to ask me like last
year to do a hair care video i would
have liked laughed in your face because
i really have never had a handle on my
hair and it's always been something that
drives me absolutely bonkers but it
seems like in the past year or so I
probably started to have more of a love
relationship with my hair let's say like
I've had more of a like relationship
with my hair then how much I have been
disgusted with it in the past so I'm
excited to do this video I'm excited to
bring you some of the tips that I have
found have worked for me especially if
you have like frizzy hair because that
is something that I have always always
always been my number one enemy and I
seem to finally be getting it under
control so if you would like to see my
hair care routine and the products that
I use please keep watching ok so the
first two products that I'm going to
mention I won't spend a whole lot of
detail in because I did just mention
them in my June favorites video my
beauty and lifestyle favorites and I
kind of go into a lot more in depth
review on them but they are from the
pier adore line and I was sent these to
review by the company and so I have been
using the shampoo and conditioner
exclusively for about the past month
just so I could have gave it a fair
review on here and I absolutely love
these products I really thought they
worked really well and the shampoo says
it's for hair loss
therapy and I lose my hair very easily I
shed a lot my hair you can always find
it all over our house it's really
disgusting so I thought it's been
working really well to keep that
shutting down and it also really does
seem to make my hair a lot fuller and
easy to manage because I also feel like
I struggle with thinning hair probably
because I lose it so easily and then
their conditioner it's their healing
conditioner it says it's for daily
manageability and I agree with that I
feel like it's been a lot easier to
manage and to tame and to style since i
started using these so i have really
good things to say on on fees and i will
link my June favorites video below if
you want to get more of an in depth
review on these and these can be bought
I they have their own website and then
you can purchase them on Amazon as well
if you thur around like the 21-22 dollar
range and then the next one said I want
to talk about so I have like at any
given time I usually have two to three
different shampoo and conditioner sets
in my shower and I am always switching
it up I feel like hair care is a lot the
same as like skin care where you know
you can find like your Holy Grail
products and use them but you don't use
only one product every single day every
single night every single time you wash
your hair you're using the exact same
product I also think of it as the same
way with workouts like I'm always
switching up my workout because your
body starts to get used to what workout
you're doing so if you do the same
kickboxing routine every single day your
body starts to adapt to it and it's
really not hard anymore for you so
that's how I view hair care as well so I
am always switching it up so I have a
few different options in my shower so
i'll kind of share with you what i have
in there but the next ones are from the
kendra line it was almost two years ago
I believe that when I went on my
honeymoon me and my husband met another
couple and she happened to be a
hairdresser and iceberg I spent like our
full vacation in st. Lucia like what do
you suggest what do you recommend for me
like please help me out and she said you
know for hair care she goes honestly
spend the money for the nicer products
because they really
work and I have always used like suave
and just kind of like herbal essences
things that are more drugstore friendly
on your pocketbook and so I was like you
know what I'm gonna listen to her advice
and I'm going to give it a try and I
went and purchased from the kenra line
and i have sent repurchased because i
was really impressed with them I
honestly do have to say like so for my
skin care video I talked about how the
more high-end products tend to like
break me out and get me more problems
and the drugstore seems to work great
for me and it's kind of like flip
flopped for hair care the drugstore and
lower end don't seem to do anything for
my hair but when I do spend a little bit
more money it really does seem to help
us for me so now I do spend more money
on my hair care so and it just seems to
help me about herself the kender line I
really could tell that it was working
well for me I got the volumizing shampoo
and the volumizing conditioner because I
feel like my hair is on the thin side
and always tends to be kind of flat I
try to use like I try to have some sort
of volumizing in my collection at some
point and right now it's on the camera
lines andhra i can get these at like
alta i think they carry them at target
too i usually just placed my order on
amazon because i use ebates and you get
cash back for it so that's usually where
I place my order is either on amazon or
alta com they run like the 23 24 dollar
range but i really like them i think
they work really well i also do have a
dry shampoo from kendra that i will
mention later but the kender line I feel
like a lot of people are familiar with
this and a lot of other people use it
and I feel like it's for a reason
because I really do like them another
line that I feel like is really loved
and a lot of people are familiar with is
the bio lash line and it was a few
summers back a few summers back it was
like five summers ago or something maybe
even more but I spent one summer and i
worked at hair salon only worked there
for the summer i just did like the desk
work well i was still in school the
college that I went to we went all year
found so we also had classes in the
summer but that's when I worked at the
hair salon and they recommended the by
allowing to me and I thought okay I oh
gosh can be a little bit just like a
little bit cheaper than the kenra I
think both of these ran me around like
the 17 18 dollar mark so just a few
dollars cheaper than the Kendra but
again if you get them at target i
purchased mine on Alta in Amazon and
places like that oh I have the hydrating
shampoo and then I have a conditioning
balm it says it's for continuous
moisture for dry and stressed hair
hydrating shampoo it says it nourishes
dry and stressed hair so clearly i'm
trying to tell you that my hair is
stressed out I all ash the thing I feel
like attracts so many people to it is it
smells so good and you can smell it on
your hair after you're done with your
shower your hair just smells good and I
feel like that just like makes people
happy when when people mentioned biolage
I swear the first thing out of my mouth
and other people's mouths is oh yeah it
smells so good doesn't it and it really
does and they have a huge huge line they
have shampoos and conditioners for
colored here and curly hair and straight
hair and I mean whatever it is that
you're looking for you're probably going
to find it from biolage so again who is
the hydrating shampoo and the
conditioner is the conditioning balm I
think I always always have biolage in my
shower and I mean probably from the five
or six years ago when I worked at the
hair salon and it was recommended to me
I always seem to have at least one if
not more of their products in my shower
and the last issue of food that I have
to talk about that are in my shower I
have them from the OGX line I don't know
if it's pronounced oh gx or I'm supposed
to be saying it a really cool way I like
you know NYX Cosmetics some people say
NYX and people are like it's next and
I'm like okay sorry but anyways these
are both just shampoos I don't have any
conditioners from the sign i'm really
not exactly a positive why the reason i
actually purchased from the oh gx line
was because i was buying a shampoo for
my husband he kind of struggles with
like dry scalp especially in the winter
time and i was doing some research
online and I found it's like they're
Australian tea
a tree shampoo I think it is supposed to
help with that and since then I
continually repurchase that for my
husband he always says that in a shower
and he says that works really well and
he likes it so when I was out buying it
for him I thought you know maybe I'm
gonna try one too I don't use these as
much as i used the kenra and the biolage
they're kind of like my backups because
I like them I I do like them I don't
love them as much as I love the Kendra
and viola but I still think they work
well blue when I have is the renewing
argon oil of Morocco shampoo i bought
this because I use like argan oil or
Moroccan oil in my hair a lot and so I
thought well what if i use it in a
shampoo will that be like 2 &amp;amp; 1 i've
tried using it just the shampoo and not
doing the oil after my shower and that
didn't really work out i tried it a few
times and was like no so i still have to
use the shampoo and use the oil in my
hair afterwards as well so the unique
precious blend of argan oil of morocco
which instantly penetrates the hair
shaft restoring shine and softness while
strengthening and creating soft
seductive silky perfection I don't feel
like I totally agree with that statement
when I was just using it by itself so i
could give it a fair review i wasn't
blown away I thought it did fine it
didn't make my hair worse but I don't
feel like it made it ten steps better
like oh okay so you know some days went
on I know that I don't have anywhere to
be for a few days or really anything to
do i'll use these from the oh gx like
just because they don't blow me away i
got was the ever straight brazilian
keratin therapy shampoo this is in their
little brown bottle it says an exclusive
blend of antioxidant rich coconut oil
along with lush keratin proteins to
strengthen and soften the hair while
avocado oil and cocoa butter eight
strong tresses adding a brilliant glow
and luminescent shine again I didn't
really really see that happen for me I
bought it because of the word keratin
and everyone is like all these keratin
treatments for I mean they were really
big just a few years ago that's like
what everyone was doing I really did
consider doing it on my hair my
profession
hairdresser at the time did keratin
treatments but I was so afraid there are
Horrors stories out there and I just got
too nervous to do it I was like hey i'll
buy shampoo and you know maybe that will
work again it didn't make my hair worse
but i don't feel like it made it
completely for his free i don't feel
like it made it super straight how it
said it was going to do and i didn't
think it made it like crazy shiny or
anything it's not bad but it's not great
it just kind of falls in the middle for
me from the OGX line but like i said my
husband for what he needs his shampoo
for it works really well for him so you
know whether you're male or female if
you do suffer from dry scalp I will I
will double check to make sure I'm
saying it right because I actually think
it used to be their Australian tea tree
shampoo and then I think they stopped
that particular brand and they created a
new one but it still has like the active
ingredient for the dry scalp and this
new one so i will make a note to check
on that so i can link it below just in
case you do need it for that reason
because he does now swear by it the OGX
line is even a little bit more
friendlier on your wallet I think they
run like twelve or thirteen dollars I
know you can buy my target or again
amazon and ulta I believe carries them
and does have a few other like random
products to talk about one is actually
one that I keep in my shower and it's
from the biolage line again this is
there aqua immersion cream mask it
doesn't steep moisture for dry or very
dry hair this is just a hair mask what I
do with this is I use it in place of my
conditioner and I usually only use this
like once a week or once every two weeks
I do need to make a disclaimer that I
don't think I've mention yet in this
video and that is that I only wash my
hair two to three times a week typically
more on the two side and some of my
girlfriends are like how can you do that
I have to shower every single day or my
hair is greasy or you know whatever so I
consider myself very lucky that I only
need to wash it you know two days a week
and it looks fine um I'm trying to think
when I last wash my hair I think this is
what i have going on right now is two
day hair but yeah I could honestly
probably get away with only washing it
once a week but I
I wash it twice a week it helps save on
products because I don't go through
shampoos and conditioners so fast but i
just also I like not having to use a lot
of products always in my hair I also do
work from home so I don't have to go
into work every day and see people you
know there's a lot of times where
there's three days straight where I
don't see anyone but my husband so just
gonna throw that out there so you guys
know but i only use this once a week or
once every two weeks visit and place my
conditioner so we'll shampoo my hair
rinse it out and then i'll put this on
it says it recommends to leave it on for
three to five minutes and it's just kind
of like a thicker cream so it's a mask
for your hair but it's supposed to help
bring hydration box your hair and just
make it more manageable it's a like a
deep conditioning treatment mask for
your hair and the hairdresser that I
said that I met in st. Lucia sh this is
something that she really recommended to
always have in the shower is you know
some sort of mask or some sort of deep
conditioning treatment and I have
listened to her this is the second one
that I have purchased from biolage
because I liked it so much it is a
little bit more in the expensive side i
believe it's nineteen dollars but again
it's very accessible the biolage line is
pretty easy to find and so i recommend
you know i'm taking advice from a
hairdresser but to have some sort of
mask in your shower to use you know once
a week or every two weeks just to kind
of like bring some more life back into
your hair i use it when i have like a
lot of times if I've done something
where I have a lot of like hairspray in
my hair you know usually anytime after
I've gone to a wedding or I've been in a
wedding or something like that it's
wedding season right now so weddings are
on my mind I'm gonna wedding in two
weeks and I just know the shower that I
take after being a bridesmaid in the
sweating and having an updo pinned and
hairspray for a full day i will be using
this mask to kind of like bring life
back into my hair okay so next I'm just
gonna kind of walk through my hair care
routine so you guys know what I do so
I'll you know a shampoo and
my hair in the shower when I get out
before I comb my hair I use the N
miracle leave-in treatment and mine is
yellow because it's for blonds I think
there's a blue one it's like the regular
one I got this from alta as a free gift
they were having like a haircare month i
think it was back in May and for every
Thursday that you purchase something
from also you got a free hair care
product and this is one of them really
grateful for it because an actual like
full size of this product is thirty
dollars which is pretty expensive so I
was able to get kind of a more like
trial size one for free but it says it
does ten things instantly which is tone
hair color enhanced brilliance reduce
fading add shine and restores moisture
restore strength detangles and d frizzes
seals the cuticle it's a thermal
protector a UV protectant and designed
for all blondes and since i started
using this i've been absolutely in love
with it before i was using this the
detangler that I would use in my hair in
place of this was from victoria secret
and it was just like their regular
detangler that they have at their store
that you can buy and I wasn't super
super impressed with it I thought it
worked fine but I wasn't like gushing
about it to anyone and I can really tell
a big difference using the it's a 10
miracle even so this is what I will use
bright after i get out the shower and
before I comb my hair I spray this
through all of my hair and I also spray
my ends pretty good and then I will comb
my hair I do not like to use heat on my
hair I can't remember the last time I
blow dried my hair it was probably when
I got my hair highlighted and cut the
hairdresser blow dried my hair after
that but just me at home I very rarely
will blow dry my hair I just let my hair
air dry and you know the less heat that
you can use on your hair is better
because he is damaging to your hair so
one of my biggest hair tips is if you
cannot use heat on your hair don't like
if you can skip the blow dryer do it if
you can't remember the last time I
straighten my hair I think about how
often I straightened my hair in college
and I'm just like oh my god to put those
like clamp and then
and then oh it just eek it makes me like
kind of able to think about i cant
rember the last time i use my
straightener i usually just this is my
natural hair this is what my hair looks
like after I let it air dry it's got
this like weird wave to it but I just
brought with it a lot of times during
this time what I'm doing is like putting
moisturizer on my body putting lotions
on my body putting any oils on putting
moisturizers around my face you know
things like that and I'm kind of letting
my hair dry just a little bit more I go
in with this breezy Oh milk and it says
it's a reparative leave in conditioning
spray I got this as a free sample from
when i purchased at sephora and honestly
i'm probably going to repurchase a full
size of this because i really love it it
just says you spray throughout your
clean damp hair focus on the mid-lengths
two ends of hair prior to drying the
lightweight leave in conditioning spray
and i really like it i think especially
compared with the into 10 it's been
doing great things for my hair I'm
really really happy with the hair care
that I have going on right now so this
is just a little guy and i only have
like this much left and so i will
probably repurchase a full size of this
i believe the full size is twenty
dollars so not anything too terrible but
honestly really really happy with that
so i have a leave in spray and then i
have a conditioning spray in my hair the
next thing that I'll do is I'll let my
hair get pretty pretty dry it's not
totally dry yet but it's not really damp
it's kind of like in between there and
then I go in with my last two product
what I actually do is kind of make my
own cocktail so how i mentioned that i
like to use like some sort of oil in my
hair this is argan hair oil from Morocco
hey I actually got this to review last
year and there is no company name on
this so I don't know who sent this to me
so I don't know but honestly I get sent
a lot of different argan oils or
Moroccan oils to review I don't know why
but I probably got in like four to five
bottles to review which is kind of crazy
so I but I go through them I'm like yes
please send
to me I will happily review them and
i'll probably going to give you a pretty
good review because i really believe in
them so this is my next bottle this
isn't one inning here maybe and i'm just
about to the halfway point of being gone
luckily i have two more bottles in my
bathroom waiting for me but what I do is
I put like two pumps of this into my
hand and then I mix it with the bedhead
control freak serum just this like
little green serum and it says this is
for first control and straightener these
are my favorite two products to cocktail
together sometimes if I know I'm not
going anywhere I don't have anything
going on i will just put two pumps of
the oil through my hair and leave it
like that but typically especially
because i only wash my hair twice a week
i'm probably going to be going somewhere
in the next three to four days so i will
typically use this as well feel like
with this combination of what I'm doing
it keeps my frizz down I I do feel like
this helps make my hair straighter my
waves are kind of more in control than
when I just used the oil on itself my
hair is a lot more like wavier or
kinkier but when I use this it kind of
helps tame it down a little bit more I
like the combination because it doesn't
weigh down my hair it doesn't make it
you know sometimes when you use products
especially oils like your hair can feel
like oily or greasy right away I don't
feel like that at all so that is just
that is my hair care routine from the
shampoo and conditioners too i use to
the conditioning treatments and the
leavin sprays and the products that I
use that is exactly step-by-step what I
do and I am really really happy with it
this is what I swear by it's what I've
been using for a really long time now
and I really can't find any reason to
switch it up because it is working so
well for me so these are a few of my
favorite products everything that I
mentioned will be in the description box
below as well of course so that is all
of the hair care products in and out of
the shower that I use I hope you found
this video helpful and maybe found a few
new products or techniques to try again
my biggest thing like what i said was
skin care to is once you
it works for you just stick with it it
took me a long time to find this routine
and finally find what works for my hair
but now that i have i really like i said
i have no reason to switch if you'll my
other hair care tips like I said you
know try not to use heat on it heat is
probably one of the worst things that we
can do to our hair if you can you know
skip some blow drying or skip some
straighteners you know try to do it I
understand that you know some people
just can't we you know you have to wash
your hair every day you have to use your
blow-dryer every day and that's okay but
maybe find other ways to kind of make up
for that in your products their big tip
that I have one is to try not to touch
your hair as much and I feel like I am
so so guilty of this I'm constantly
touching my hair but you have to
remember that you know your hands you
use your hands every day you're
constantly touching something whether it
be your computer or your phone our
animals or whatever it is and so you're
getting that on your hands and then when
you touch your hair you know that can be
really bad for your hair and I've
learned that thoughts can be another
cause of frizz and I frizz really bad so
I tried to remember to leave my hair
alone as much as I can another tip that
I would suggest is to try to leave your
hair down and away from hair ties as
much as you can what I try to use is
like those claw clips and I don't have
one by me right now but if I want my
hair back and off my face I try to use
claw clips because they aren't as
damaging as like the elastic bands that
we use in our hair those can be really
bad for you especially because when you
take them out you can tend to pull a lot
of your hair out with it like sometimes
I'll hold up my rubber band if I've been
working out and I have my hair up and
I'll look at my band and there's like 20
strands of hair on there and I'm like
dang it all that hair I just lost so if
you can try to stay away from rubber
bands elastics things like that when
putting up your hair you know again I
know that's not copy you know I know
that might not work for everybody and I
work out every day and I can't work out
with my hair down I can't go for really
long walks with my dog in the summer and
have my hair down and on my shoulders
like I need to have my hair up but if
I'm just sitting
at home and you know want to get my hair
off my face I try to use those claw
clips as much as I can to try to stay
away from the rubber bands just a few of
the tips and like tricks that I try to
remember throughout the day that I feel
like once I started being very conscious
of these things and combined with the
hair care routine that I found have
worked from me I am so much happier with
my hair I mean when I said that I've
struggled with my hair and especially
frizzy hair I don't mean like it's just
been like a few years that I've
struggled with hair this dates all the
way back to when I was a little kid and
a reason why I've always hated having
frizzy hair or hair that I dislike is
because I think my ears stick out and
actually after I was born the doctor
told my mom if they wanted to go ahead
with an ear pinning surgery that they
recommend it I get my ears pinned back
because even from the moment that I was
born you could tell that my ears stuck
out and my mom opted against it because
she just thought that was kind of crazy
to do for a baby and sometimes I wish it
would have done it and sometimes you
know I'm fine with it it's the way I am
you know you can't do anything about it
and as I've gotten older I've come more
comfortable with it and I've also found
ways to work around it like for my
wedding day I've been married for almost
two years and I remember doing my hair
trial and I was like well I want an updo
but can you please somehow utilize my
hair and make my hair pin my ears back
and that's exactly what we did and that
way I wasn't as self-conscious on my
wedding day or in my wedding photos
about my ears because that's probably
like number one thing on my body that I
would say I'm most self-conscious about
and when I was younger I never wanted to
put my hair up because then my ears
would stick out but I don't want to
leave my hair down because when i say i
had frizzy hair I mean it was like it
was so frizzy and big and it just always
looked not good and I remember wanting
to be a true leader so bad going into
high school that's all I wanted to do I
wanted to be a cheerleader but you had
to wear your hair up during cheerleading
during practice and during games you
always had to have your hair up and
pulled off your face and I remember
Ryan one day to my cousin and saying
well now I can't try out for
cheerleading because I can't wear my
hair up in front of all of those people
except so self-conscious about my hair
but hey I didn't let it stop me and I
was a cheerleader Allah for years in
high school and I absolutely loved it so
we all have those little things that
make us uncomfortable might happens to
be my ears couple that with hair that
was really difficult to leave down and I
struggled for a long time to be happy
with my appearance because of those two
big things now that I'm 28 it is a
little bit easier for me I can wear my
hair up now and I don't feel
self-conscious about it I can wear it in
buns and you know be around friends and
I'm not not like is everyone staring at
my ears for bigger events like my
wedding since it is something that I
feel more self-conscious about I was
more comfortable being able to use my
hair to kind of pin back my ears for me
but you know we all have those little
insecurities and it is what it is just a
little story about me and so you can

struggled trying to nail down my hair
