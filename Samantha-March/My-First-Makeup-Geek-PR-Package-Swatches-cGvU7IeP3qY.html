life this is my first youtube live so I
really have no idea what I am doing but
here we are so hi everybody if anyone's
here I have no idea what even like be
looking oh I see some people saying hi
hi people hi making me so hopefully that
means hi reckless beauty I really just
have no idea what I'm doing
so but I really wanted to try a youtube
live because I know a lot of people are
doing lives and so I just needed to do
it hi everybody
Ashley Willis oh my gosh hi everybody I
didn't know anyone would be able to hop
on this is so cool
um I like I seriously I don't know where
to look my setup you guys is so this is
like the Genki a thing ever right now
but that's totally fine because that's
that's just totally fine hi Mickey oh my
gosh cool
so in today's youtube live I'm going to
be going over my first package from
makeup geek which has me so excited so I
have everything set out right here so
they sent me a bunch of their regular
shadows and then also a whole bunch of
their foiled eyeshadows so I want to go
through and swatch everything and then
they also did send me three different
lip products so I thought I could go
through and swatch everything hopefully
I won't make the first live too long
especially since I'm not really sure
what it is that I'm doing but I thought
maybe would be fun to see this package
so the comments I can see like the
comments coming in but they like come in
and then they go out I don't know what
that means I don't know if that's good
or bad but okay let's just try it so
first I'm going to go through the
regular shadows and I'm not going to go
in any real particular order like
literally my hands are shaking like life
is so scary it's so much scarier than
just talking to your camera so I'm gonna
go through hi Gloria oh my goodness this
is so much fun okay
I'm going to go through the regular ones
first and then just do some swatches
like I said I'm not going to do it in
any particular order I do have oh they
also sent
um when my trying to say like a magnetic
palette which is super cool and says
makeup geek on it so I can pop some of
the shadows in here and then I actually
do have my own Z palette with um some
makeup geek shadows when jaclyn hill did
a like favorite makeup geek shadows i
bought a bunch of them so i do have some
in here and i know i will have some
repeats so you'll see that in a future
giveaway but when we go ahead and start
some swatching okay thank you stop being
nervous you're doing great thank you
thank you okay so the first shade I'm
going to pull out is mocha which oh my
gosh this looks beautiful well okay so
this is what mocha looks like this is so
weird being on my phone I don't know I
don't know where I'm supposed to be
looking I'm pretty sure my phone is
actually like upside down no one's told
me I'm upside down so oh that's got to
be good so this one is called mocha
looks like a beautiful matte Brown ooh
there is what mocha looks like I'm not
upside down Thank You Vanessa because
I'm pretty sure my phone is so that one
is mocha and that is stunning
I would look beautiful upside down do
though thanks Mickey thanks I appreciate
that
oh man and the next one I have is drama
queen I was so overwhelmed to get this
package because makeup geek was like one
of the first like newer brands to me
when I started my youtube channel so it
just really was so exciting when I got
the email from them I remember I could
remember seeing the email come through
and me thinking like it's definitely not
from them it's you know it's got to be
just like a regular email okay we're
having a sale or something but me and
that was that was quite a day okay so
this one is called
drama queen that looks gorgeous notice
my hands shaking that's probably gonna
happen the whole time this one is drama
queen
oh that one is so pretty someone just
asked me if I could do a purple look so
look at those colors together though
they look really pretty
okay I've been really worried about my
dog and how she's going to be reacting
to this but so far I think she just
thinks I'm filming a regular video so
she seems pretty unperturbed okay this
next one is called unexpected mmm this
one looks really pretty there is what
unexpected looks like here he's as cool
thanks Rosa I think she's pretty cool
too you should see her I filmed a vlog
today for organizing my office and she
literally slept the whole time like I
kept showing her on camera just like
sleeping away
she's so utterly ridiculous okay so this
one is called unexpected and one is
really pretty these shades could go
overly actually all three of those
shades could go really well together
woo folks fighting okay so those are
that I did remember to grab out some
wipes because that was like one of my
thing I was like have everything out
because you are alive you cannot cut
anything out like you forget anything
you're just screwed like what are you
going to do so I remembered to pull out
my makeup wipes okay unexpected is one
of my favorites is it a purple yes the
last two that I did were both purple one
was a deeper purple and then one was um
kind of more like a violet cool first
time seeing someone live however the
things that is so cool Mickey Oz what
color is on my lid today I have Peach
Smoothie from makeup geek creme brulee
Coco bear and then shimma shimma is like
the silver shade that is on my lid Oh so
this one is Coco bear so I have that so
I don't want to swatch that one so
okay so this was my makeup geek shadows
so this one right here in the middle
that one is Coco bear and it's freaking
gorgeous
I was so ho so obsessed with this when I
got it because it's just that beautiful
like warm brown that you like you just
need so this is the one that is in my
crease to kind of darken it up I love
Coco bear it's definitely one of my
absolute favorites so any of that I do
have I'll put into a future giveaway so
the next one I have is corrupt which I
believe is a black right yeah that looks
white walk okay so this one is corrupt
and I hear really good things about the
shades so that looks insanely black holy
crap okay it is very black but it's not
like I swear the blackest black that I
have seen in a palette is the Kat Von D
shade + light eye palette that black in
there is freakin like unreal the next
one I have is called prom night well
that's fun that brings back memories
booth so much really pretty it looks
kind of kind of like got some silver to
it someone else are they similar in size
to the makeup forever singles I don't
know I hope I don't have like anything
for makeup forever which is really
terrible that one is really pretty
whew so there is a swatch of prom night
that's way pretty mmm-hmm I do like prom
night okay good stuff and I don't know
like what do you guys think of my
placement am I too close is my camera
like I don't know let me let me know
what you think um I really didn't know
like basically once you hit live like
you're just you're just there you're
just live so I kind of figure out um
like camera placement or anything like
that so I just kind of basically have it
set up how I would do a regular video
except I
right on like my mini tripod that I got
for vlogging and I have it
it has flexible legs so I have the legs
wrapped around my regular tripod it
looks kind of insane right now but you
know what that happens and someone's
calling me someone from Washington DC is
calling me that is rude can I hit
decline all right that one oh why I
don't know who's calling but no no I
also I kept telling my husband I'm like
I'm going live on YouTube I'm going live
on YouTube because he's probably going
to come home while I'm filming this he's
like okay okay I won't bother you 3:59
he sends me a text message asking me
what time we play volleyball tonight I'm
like dude like come on I told you okay
you said I'm not centered or should I go
should I go this way I still feel like
I'm not centered I don't know I'm not so
we play around with this part so another
one oh this one is shimma shimma which
like I said is all over my lid right now
it's one of my favorites I have like a
huge dent in it it's this one right here
oh that's a lot better yeah okay cool I
love your highlight it's the Marc Jacobs
coconut gel highlighter I'm freaking so
much else with that highlight right now
so this one is shimma shimma and it is
just hmm
it is so gorgeous I absolutely love it
one of my favorites
oh this next one is creme brulee so
that's another one I have that will go
on the giveaway pile so creme brulee is
this middle one right here notice the
hands shaking noticing I'm shaking yes
shimma shimma it's what I have is like
my brow bone highlight in my inner
corner highlight - but creme brulee is
that middle one right there it's what I
first put all over my crease and it's
just so gorgeous like there's some days
where I literally just put creme brulee
all over my lid and call it a day so I
don't know if it'd be a little seat yeah
yeah I can see so there is creme brulee
one of my favorites my office is already
looking like a disaster I think I
dropped some oh I dropped them on the
floor don't I me
it is just it was just fun I dropped on
the floor oh this one is glamorous so I
have this one too so glamorous is this
one this one right here it's a really
pretty um like bronze shimmer shade let
me see if I can do this with my nails oh
no I just dug my nail in it Wow
mmm can you tell so that one's glamorous
right there and there is a swatch of
glamorous this was another one I
remember last summer I would just wear
it all over my lid like constantly it
was so beautiful when I started um what
was I when I started buying from makeup
geek which was probably like what like
two years ago or something
they were definitely more affordable I
feel like they're more expensive now I
talked about a new makeup geek palette
and um one of my last will i buy it
videos and they're definitely they've
gotten more expensive so it's probably a
big reason why I have a purchase from
them a whole lot lately so to get a
package and to get a package like this
was like the most overwhelming thing in
the world so I think that was all of the
regular swatches so now I'm going to
move over into the foiled ones which I'm
so excited because I don't have any of
the foiled shadows and I hear like just
absolutely amazing things about this so
hi Jessica
hi oh my gosh this is so cool oh man
okay so first up we have mesmerised oh
my gosh I just I have like such high
expectations for these it almost kind of
makes me nervous
so here is what mesmerised looks like oh
oh
that one was mesmerised that was amazing
oh my gosh okay this next one is Houdini
I just hear such great things a lot of
people have been comparing um the like
foil makeup eek shadows to Natasha to
Nona so when I saw that but I saw those
comments coming I was like really now
okay so this one is Houdini oh my gosh
look at I don't even want to smudge it
it's so beautiful okay okay oh no no oh
my goodness huh what
that is gorgeous Haylie doing your
physics homeworks way to go girl way to
go look at Houdini that is sick that is
sickening oh my word
okay so next we have plot twist oh I
hope I love it if anybody's new here and
you don't know I'm an author so plot
twist sometimes you just hear me yelled
up from my office you never know I do
get asked a lot I don't know if you'll
be able to see it here but you can see
it in other videos some people have
asked like what's the black writing on
your wall it says quiet please Neville
in progress and can you see it that's my
latest book and then this is an article
with me and my dog um that was written
about me in like my hometown newspaper
magazine thing so all about my books and
stuff but this one is plot twist mMmmm
that looks so pretty what are these oh
my god oh my goodness
look at all of those swatches how much
are these foil shadows because I know
even if they are more expensive that is
still insane Wow
okay okay well I'm excited okay I don't
even want to wipe them off they're so
pretty
hello so you said you want them I know I
know girl I'm gonna have to like get
a lot more of these for my next fun
giveaway or something now that I know
how freaking awesome they are cheese I
mean I hear people say good things but I
don't know I don't know if it's just I
maybe I don't see them a lot or
something I don't know I didn't know
that they were going to be that good
okay so the next one I have is called
ritzy all right
twenty minutes are we in does it tell me
oh yeah fifteen minutes okay
okay I'm like my goal is to not make
this an hour even though I talk a lot
but let's see this one is ritzy that
looks gorgeous whoa whoa whoo that's a
really pretty gold Oh hold on okay so
this one is ritzy Amy ass did I get the
beauty in the beasts Larocque no I
haven't gotten anything yet I still want
to get that cheek palate though mmm is
it not coming Alta or is it comment Alta
I feel like I've heard conflicting
things because I was trying to wait till
I came to all just so I could use my
points because that makes me not feel as
guilty this next one is karma karma
looks really pretty okay this one is
karma whoa oh that looks blinding April
says these foil I chose are bomb hi
Abigail yeah whoa whoa why I got gun
these like this is not making me feel
like a fool wow that one is so pretty
what was this one this one is karma mmm
mmm as no dope this next one is legend
oh wow that looks like a penny that like
legit looks like a penny okay they feel
really good too like even just like
putting my finger in them to swatch them
that one is legend that really is like a
penny on my freaking hand look at all of
those
so beautiful um after I do this so I
think like after you do a live swatch I
check lorac other I had a stack of
everything already well okay then
I was kind of I don't know I don't I
don't know what I thought about the
lorac meeting the Beast because it just
came with like no warning I thought that
was so weird
didn't anyone else think that was weird
I don't know if I really like
appreciated that or a lot I don't like
why not briones I don't know sometimes I
feel like brands tried trick us I don't
really appreciate that so um what was I
going to say um after I do this and I
think like once I get done it'll then
like process and upload as a regular
video on my youtube channel in case you
want to come back and like rewatch any
swatches or anything or if you can't
make it live and you're now watching it

while getting used to talk to a camera

what's what do you do if I get kicked
off and the people can't see me do you
have to like go out and come back in or
something I'm not sure I'm Samantha what
do you think about the Kylie cosmetics
vacation edition collection
I don't know no I don't have I don't
have all my thoughts put together on
that one yet I just saw the prices today
I was interesting then I saw the Kim
Kardashian news that was even more
interesting uh Kylie announced it I had
like the busiest weekend of life I
wouldn't saw Avenged Sevenfold and
Metallica on Friday and then I played in
a wiffle ball tournament on Saturday
which was like the most interesting
thing in my life because I'm totally not
athletic like that but I did that and
then I was supposed to have brunch on
Sunday it got canceled I went to lunch
instead but I was gone all weekend so I
had to film I will I buy it on like
Thursday or something like that I had to
film it pretty early but I want to say
Kylie didn't talk about the collection
until like Sunday which typically I
would already have filmed it before
subjects I like to make sure I can have
it edit it and ready to go by 9:00 a.m.
Wednesday so I'll have to talk about the
Kylie collection in next week's will I
buy video and I live oh my gosh thanks
for coming by um and I asked the what
news about Kim Kardashian she's starting
her own makeup line so there's that okay
so this one is grandstand II I'm so I
feel like I hear somebody good things
about this shade so okay oh horse
oh no of course I'm reading the comments
saying this okay this is grandstand well
there is a grandstand that's gorgeous
oh these are so pretty like that I can't
wait I can't wait I'm so excited I'm so
excited to get into these you guys Wow
okay so I think that's all of the shades
um yes I'm pretty sure that's all the
shades my office is a complete disaster
right now
they also sent along some lipsticks so
hi hi Tinka hey Lela oh my gosh
Mickey said can we give a bit of a bold
look from some of these yes yes I'm so
excited I feel like I have been kind of
doing more interesting things with my
makeup lately or at least I've been
trying like in my eyes I've been trying
um but I think was it yesterday's video
that I had like the blue liner and then
um tomorrow's video is a tomorrow's
video no Thursday's video I have like
the brightest lip on ever if you follow
me on snapchat it's like the brightest
lip of life it is crazy okay so this is
their wait what is this let me look the
box this is their iconic lipstick okay
in candid iconic lipstick and candid
this is what the packaging looks like oh
my gosh the comments are coming in hard
and fast maybe I need to try makeup you
guys know I know right like whoa okay so
this one is candid ooh I don't like my
swatches off oh that's a really
beautiful samantha shade right there so
that is candid that feels really nice it
does it's definitely not like a liquid
lipstick of course but it feels like a
very nice like almost like moisturizing
lipstick and that shade is really pretty
so that one is candid okay so let me
wipe off some of these swatches well
we're sure guys's favorite eyeshadow
swatch I don't even know I don't even
know what my favorites were I know I'd
have to go back and look at him again
but the foiled shadows had me all sorts
of shook up man okay Houdini yahood yeah
Houdini that was so good okay so this
one is another iconic one this wasn't it
lively I like the packaging on these I
guess I just never really like heard
anything about the lipsticks like I know
kathleenlights did a lip swatch video
and then I never really heard about them
so I feel like when people don't talk
about stuff it means they don't like
them so that's why I did buy any but I
don't know but now
to give them my own opinion and tell you
guys what I think okay so that one is
lively so it's a really pretty pink
shade that one didn't feel like as I
wonder if these have different finishes
because the first one definitely felt
like moisturizing and then the other one
felt more matte so okay good to know
good to know and then the last one we
have this says foiled this is a lipstick
lip gloss this is a lip gloss foiled lip
gloss alright in acoustic alrighty anna
says yeah nobody talks about it I didn't
even know they had lipsticks oblak ooh
block somebody who I don't know how to
block people huh I don't know how oh
crap
um I'm not sure I guess I'll have to
figure out we have a troll well hmm kind
of comes with the territory I guess but
does anybody know how to block Melissa
says got him
okay thanks ah cool I don't know how to
block people I've never seen that so
thanks guys thanks for your help I
missed what happened
he posted a penis picture oh come on how
people okay so this is one of their
foiled lipsticks that was so annoying
Oh like who actually wants to see that
like come on he got reported and removed
ah thanks Jennifer
we it's like we're just here to talk
about makeup people you got to go to a
different chat for that mm-hmm okay so
this is the foiled lipgloss in acoustic
mmm that is pretty I don't know that's a
lip gloss like that is very pigmented
for a lip gloss I like to try that out
definitely out of the three lipsticks
they sent me this one is my favorite I
think that one was in candid candid I
think it was that one's definitely my
favorite and it felt really nice too but
I'll try out the lip gloss I'm getting
more into lip glosses lately so I'll
give that a whirl let you guys know what
I think
ah so that's cool make you said I'm
sorry but this is so cool like this is
live with them oh thanks we are doing
serious
pick ups up here no one has time for a
penis troll that is right we don't got
time for that
loneliness I should be in bed but
Samantha's alive I'll have double coffee
tomorrow but I'm staying oh my gosh you
