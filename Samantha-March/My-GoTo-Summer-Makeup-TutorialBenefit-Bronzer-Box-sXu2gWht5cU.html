welcome back to my channel I'm really
excited today because I have my first
makeup tutorial for you really excited
so many people have been asking for
tutorials and I'm not a makeup artist I
literally just started learning how to
apply makeup and brushes to buy and all
that fun stuff like probably last year
so I'm kind of a newbie at it so it made
me nervous i also am still filming off
my phone so i was like how do i make a
good quality video doing a makeup
tutorial on my phone kind of worked out
this is the final result that we got i'm
using the benefit bronzer box that i
mentioned in my past Sephora haul using
a lot of products out of that box
including all of my eyeshadows this look
is kind of like what's turned into my
go-to summer look I've been using it so
much i play with different lip colors
today i did the pink to kind of match my
shirt but the point of it is to be kind
of a simple and fast go to summer look i
don't use any liquid foundation i only
have two eyeshadows on I didn't do
anything to super crazy with my eyeliner
or anything like that I hope you enjoyed
this tutorial and if you want to see how
I got this look please keep watching and
sign my eyes and use the Too Faced
shadow insurance primer and just put
them all over my eyelid be using this
the bronze of Champions the box i got
from benefits i'm going to be using
basically everything in here so this is
everything in here first i'm going to
start off using bikini teeny it's a
cream eyeshadow and then after that i'm
going to move in and use this bronze
shimmery shadow
part i'm really only putting this brown
shadow like i'm kind of leaving my inner
corner alone so I can keep that cream
eyeshadow peeking through so I'm just
putting it like on the edges and kind of
rubbing it into my crease building it
out from hair I don't like to put I
shadows down except to make your eyes
with more clothes I'm going to be using
this Maybelline line stiletto it is a
liquid eyeliner I like using liquid
eyeliner fold I think it makes the line
a little bit more precise and when using
a cream eyeshadow i just find using a
liquid after it as your eyeliner just
works easier than a regular pencil or a
gel eyeliner i do first is I create the
wing and then I fill in the rest of the
line across my eyes
and I kind of take that line that I'm
doing I bring it out and connect it with
the wing that I've made what you can do
if you do mess up on your eyeliner and I
actually did a pretty decent job being
on camera but what you can do is when
you start to conceal your under eyes you
can put some of your concealer like say
you made your wing too big or too long
or something you can put your concealer
underneath that wing and then pad it out
and it's kind of like an instant fix
that's what I use when I'm doing like a
heavy dramatic look instead of using
tape because it's never lima to thofe
wrightsville that's the technique that I
use my bottom lash line I'm going to be
using this NYX tray sholay it's kind of
like their gel eyeliner pencil looks
like this I'm going to be putting that
on my bottom waterline and then I'm
going to be smudging that brown shimmery
powder I'm going to be smudging bad
underneath my lower lash line
to finish off the eyes I'm going to be
going in with their real mascara that is
in that benefit box
the eyes are done moving into the face
the primer that I'm going to be using
Maybelline master prime I have the blur
and illuminate primer and I like this
because I'm going to go in with a
mattifying foundation powder so I like
to have this to blur out any
imperfections but also help give me that
like summer dewy look nation that I'm
using I during the summer I don't like
to use a lot of heavy like liquid
foundations because I just feel like I
like clogging up my skin and i'm outside
a lot so i like to use a powder and I've
really been enjoying this Maybelline fit
me powder I have the 310 in Sun beige
and it's slightly dark for me but it
kind of like darkens up my skin a little
bit so i like to use it it is the matte
and poreless which is why i use the
illuminate primer and then i have the
matte foundation I feel like it balances
really well so it gives me a matte look
but then I'm also like somewhat summer
Dewey at the same time I'll buy that all
over my face with this BH Cosmetics
powder brush
next I'm going to go in and use this
concealer this is from the Maybelline
line as well the fit me concealer and
this is in the shade 10 light I'm just
going to put this under my under eyes
and then also some areas to highlight my
face blend it out with my damp Beauty
Blender which is really dirty right now
so tues ignore that then i'm going to
set all of that with my Rimmel stay
matte translucent powder and my ELF
small tapered brush
for concealing I make this kind of leg
Gary football math underneath and then I
bring it up because you always want to
look in your face I bring the concealer
up again if I need to like sharpen my
wing or do better with the Islander I
shadow I can do it at this point as well
and then I'm also going to keep eye
concealer and on of the thumb on my
forehead down the bridge of my nose on
my Cupid's bow and on my chin and
highlight areas of the face but I want
to highlight and then i blend it all out
with my Beauty Blender you want to make
sure that your beauty blender blender is
damp if you're using it dry probably not
going to do anything so using a damp is
good and if you find yourself using like
too much product like you've used too
much concealer the water from the Beauty
Blender so help kind of take that extra
product away
and you just want to be dabbing it and
here get like don't white or things like
that or just wanted a bit and you're
just cutting it into your camp and I'm
just going to set everything to
then when you're doing this as well
again just like make sure you're
bringing that powder up because the
translucent powder is also going to help
brighten up everything and so when you
do and just swipe up again
always be lifting our face
bronzer I'm going to go back into the
benefice box and i'm going to use their
akula bronzer and it also comes with a
little brush so that's what i'm going to
use to just like slightly brahms of my
face to use this brush is like a contour
brush for it's like kind of putting the
product into my cheekbone contour and
then just to know
and upwards towards my temple to give my
face a bronze to look prancing or
contouring you always want to go up
don't go down Bonz just a little bit
like up on my forehead near my airline
Ron's up those areas and then I'll just
a little bit like underneath my draw a
line to get my face some shadows and if
for blush I'm going to go in with this
milani blush it is in the color JP
brush from bh cosmetics
hi back to Apple go to teach and kind of
blend it outwards towards simple
one thing I like to do at this time is
go back in with like my foundation brush
and just kind of blend everything out
blend everything together
station with my brown bear with my blush
just on my facebook having like harsh
line for the final step I'm going back
inside benefit boss be there Watts up
highlighter and this becomes in like a
stick form
put this on the tops of my cheekbones
and a little bit on the bridge of my
nose and on my cube explode it's kind of
give me more of a glowy look
I like bring it into like right in the
center of my cheekbone and kind of lend
it out from there a little bit on my
nose and on my Cupid's bow and this I
would like the light to feel those areas
will respect and just timing to look a
little bit more glowy I just kind of
wanted like a bright pink color so i'm
using this lipstick from elk it came in
like part of a gift package set so it
doesn't have a theme but i'm going to be
using just a bright color dose to finish
it off lip liner sugar or an emery this
is our easy summer look
after lipstick i'm just going to use the
settings phrases from victoria secret
i'm just going to spray all over my face
it's very hydrating for your face
sometimes during long summer days I just
bring this out with me and I was gonna
spray throughout the day just to kind of
like cut me up and hydrate me again but
it also is a setting spray figure myself
go won't smudge and smear throughout the
day this is the final result of my very
first makeup look that I have done I
