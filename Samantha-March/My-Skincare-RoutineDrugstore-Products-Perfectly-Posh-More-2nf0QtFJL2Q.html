today I'm going to be doing my skincare
routine and I posted something on
Instagram a few nights ago and it was
just like a picture of a few of the
products that I was using and I said
like you know using these products
tonight and someone mentioned doing the
skin care video and so then I asked
about it some more on social media and
people were saying yes they would like
to see it and so I just decided to film
that for you I'm really excited because
all of these are really affordable
products that I use I don't use a lot of
high-end skincare because i have found
like I have very sensitive skin and to
me it's like the more expensive the
product gets the more I tend to break
out so I actually use a lot of you know
drugstore products from target and
places like that and I think it works
pretty well for me I very rarely have
breakouts and I just feel like my skin
is usually pretty fresh clean free and
all that good stuff so if you'd like to
see the products that I use please keep
watching so the very first thing that I
do want to mention because it is part of
my skincare routine is that in addition
to like the cleansers and the
moisturizers and things like that that I
use on a daily basis in my home I also
do frequently get chemical peels you may
have heard me talk about my best friend
who is a medical esthetician but she is
licensed to do things like chemical
peels and so I try to do one every week
or so run the cheeky chicks together on
Instagram so we're together a lot doing
yoga and focusing on our fitness page
and so I will ask for things like
chemical peels and she also like does my
eyebrow waxing and all that fun stuff
you get a chemical peel I think they are
pretty expensive to do in the salons and
I've had one done in a salon not by my
friend and it was like several years ago
and it was like one of those horror
stories or my face it just looked like
someone had stripped off so many layers
of my skin and I was red for like
literally days and so when my friend was
like I'll do this for you i was like no
please don't because it's going to be
really scary but what she did was that
she started at a lower percentage and
slowly moved her way up as i became
accustomed to the
peels so I do try to do that once a week
sometimes in the summer it can be harder
because I just can't find the time so
sometimes it's like once every two weeks
once every three weeks or things like
that but that is pretty much the only
part of my skincare routine that is like
something I don't do at home and
something that I think could be
considered more high-end so just want to
throw that out there for you but the
first thing that I want to talk about is
what I do in my shower and this is
something that i really recommend is
having a good exfoliator in your shower
because when you get in the shower and
you know start to shampoo and condition
your hair and all that good stuff it's a
heat and the steam from your shower will
start to open up your pores and that's a
really good time to wash your face
because when your pores are open
whatever you're using to wash your face
is going to be able to like get down in
there and really help get you clean so I
just keep an exfoliator in my shower at
all times right now what I have in here
is the Neutrogena oil-free acne wash and
it's the pink grapefruit foaming scrub
and I I really really like fruit from
the Neutrogena line I think it smells so
good I love having this exfoliator in my
shower uplifting boss of grapefruit plus
vitamin C and it helps clears blemishes
and blackheads it has the microbeads to
smooth away roughness and it says it's
not over drying or irritating for your
skin and I would agree with all of these
I think this is what I had in my shower
last time and then when I ran out of it
already purchased it again because i was
so impressed with it so if you're able
to put any sort of like exfoliator into
your shower I would really recommend
that and you know wait a little bit
after you get in your shower get that
heat going on the steam going and open
up your pores and then wash your face
then moving on to the two products that
I use most in the morning I hear this
about hair care and i also have heard it
about skin care and it's kind of like
mixed up your products mixed up what
you're using on your face you know if
you find those products that you love
that's great but maybe like don't use it
to wash your face in the morning
night and the next day in the morning
and at night like have some a few
different products so I have I do have a
few different products that I can share
with you guys what I use but these two
are kind of the ones that I use a lot in
the morning they're just like what I
want to go to in the morning one in
clear morning burst facial cleanser I
like very rarely use this at night and I
don't know if it's because like it tells
me to use it in the morning I'm going to
use it in the morning I don't know what
it is but it says have bursting beads
that wakes you up rinses clean and with
vitamin C and ginseng and I think this
smells so good like okay I don't think
it smells good like it like fruity and
like you're on a spa type of thing like
it smells like it's cleaning your skin I
don't know but I absolutely love the
smell I don't know like how super
without this morning burst facial
cleanser for beautiful energized skin
it's a foaming cleanser with bursting
fees that burst with energy and vitamins
in an invigorating citrus fragrance help
wake you up the gentle cleanser with
vitamin C and ginseng helps nourish skin
while removing the dirt oil and
impurities that build up overnight so
that won't clog pores it's
hypoallergenic and so it looks like this
and it has like the regular pump tube
and then when you pump it into your
hands it looks like what's in the bottle
but then once you start to like lather
it and put it on your face it turns kind
of foamy and I just I really really love
this bottle I've ever had of it i'm only
this far in but i feel like i've been
using it for months like i'm getting a
lot of use out of this one next ones
that I use a lot in the morning is once
again the Neutrogena oil-free acne wash
and the pink grapefruit this is the
cream cleanser like I'm not kidding when
I say that I really love that pink
grapefruit smelt like I really love that
pink grapefruit smell and I like to have
this one to use in the morning because
it is a cream cleanser so it feels just
like really creamy on your skin at night
I like to kind of like slot away my
makeup and feel like I'm really like
digging deep down there and getting rid
of my makeup but in the morning like I
just want something to like refresh my
face and I think this is such a good
thing to use it says a clears breakouts
it's one hundred percent naturally
derived from grapefruit extract and it
does have salali acid acne treatment
that's formulated with micro clear a
patent
technology proven to cut through oil
quickly to speed acne medicine straight
to the source of breakouts it's infused
with vitamin C and one hundred percent
naturally derived extracts of grapefruit
to indulge your senses with an uplifting
refreshing ascent and I totally agree
with all that that is another one I love
to use in the morning and then in the
evening I have my other to go to
products and the first one is by L'Oreal
Paris and it's the new go 360 clean deep
facial cleanser I honestly don't know
how new this is because i think i bought
it like last year and I'm getting like
way down here but seriously like a year
and I use this so often and so many
nights because it comes with its own
little like scrubber and mine is
probably 30 and I'm sorry but I use it
all the time it comes with this own
little scrubber and you just pop the top
off and put it on there and scrub it I
wet my face first and then I rub it all
over and it just feels like you're
you're getting it done you're getting
your makeup off you're removing all the
the dirt and all the oils and the makeup
and everything that you have on your
face so I really really like this one
it's deeply clean skin and unclogs poor
by poor it removes all traces of oil
dirt and makeup and forth until visibly
smaller and this one is oil free as well
and I think it's great another one that
I use a lot at night it's from the clean
and clear line and this is the deep
action cream cleanser and this is oil
free as well it says it cleans deep down
to the pores has a cool refreshing
tingle and deep cleans even dirt and oil
you can't see and this one I gravitate
to at night even though it is like a
cream cleanser I said I wear a lot of
makeup I tend to use the l'oreal the
green one that i just showed i tend to
use that because i feel like i'm really
getting my makeup off but there are
several days where I don't wear any
makeup at all over from home and I just
kind of hang out around the house and
when I do but you know even though
you're not wearing makeup throughout the
day you're still you know touching your
face your cell phone is on your face you
know maybe we're resting pens or
something on your face and whatnot so
your face is still dirty even though you
don't have any makeup on and so those
nights are
really like to use the cream cleanser
and I'd like to use this one because of
the smell it says it has like a cool
refreshing tingle the smell is what gets
me to use it at night go I love the
smell it feels almost like I don't know
it smells to me almost like medicine all
like it's really helping clear out my
face at night and then even when I go to
bed I feel like it's still working even
though I washed it off so this is what I
gravitate to a lot of nights where I
haven't worn makeup during the day but I
still want to clean my face I go for
this cream cleanser then I have been so
lucky to get a few more perfectly posh
samples in my friend Cassie she actually
was my first roommate in college she is
now perfectly posh consultant and she
asked if she could send me a few samples
my way to try out and I said yes and
I've been trying out a few things
regularly for this past week and they
all are involved with skincare so I
wanted to talk about them because i
actually have really enjoyed them
perfectly posh or maybe you saw my other
perfectly posh video and you still want
to order a few things i will leave
cassie's to her website and her facebook
page and if there is anything that you
want to order go ahead and check it out
and let her note a sample of the BFF
best face forever exfoliating daily face
wash and i actually got a little sample
of it and then i actually ordered
something else from perfectly posh and
it came with another sample of this
smells like this is the best day ever
because i love this face wash you guys
wash with the pea sized dollop and warm
water as part of your daily face routine
and rinse thoroughly as it is a vegan i
really enjoy this it's made with
biodegradable eco scrub whack speeds and
so even though the beads are in there
and you feel like you are exfoliating
your face it doesn't feel too rough on
me like i feel like i can use it in the
morning and also add evening and i don't
feel like it's ever too hard or too
abrasive on my face it smells really
good and i have been using it all day
for probably the last seven days i think
it is and i have not broke out which is
always kind of like my big fear when i
try something new in skin care i have
not
broke out at all I think it is fantastic
I really do want to repurchase this
product because I'm loving it so much
I'm so happy I got another new sample
because i'm going to keep using it and
keep seeing how well it's treating my
face because i think it is going
phenomenally well that other two
products that i got i don't actually
have them with me because they were just
like in little tubes and i have had
since used them up but one was day and
night face moisturizer and i love this
because it was kind of a thicker
consistency which I I will share my
regular moisturizer later but my regular
moisturizer is more thinner this one was
thicker and I just felt especially when
I used it at night and that's what I
gravitated towards using it on was at
night I just felt like it was like
healing my skin but it also to me had
sense of like lavender in it which is
very relaxing and so I loved being able
to use it at night because when I would
like be on my pillow and breathe in I
could smell lavender lavender is the
scent for relaxation so I just
absolutely love the moisturizer again my
face has not broke out so the skin I
think this will work just fine for you
and honestly the smell is what got me
and even when i was talking to Cassie
about it I was like but this smells so
good like right it smells good right the
last item that I've been trying out is
something pretty different and it's it
was called the caffeinate or skin stick
and the skin stick actually comes in
like a regular tube it's like a actual
stick of the product but what it is
basically is caffeine and you put it on
certain parts of your face that you want
to pep up and what I've been using it
for is underneath my eyes you know if
you wake up you've had a long night what
your eyes are puffy and you want to kind
of dislike that and make you look more
awake I've been just using like little
small sizes underneath my eyes and then
there's any other faiths like sometimes
I use it right here and between my
eyebrows just to kind of like give that
skin a little jolt little boost of
energy and I think it works great i
absolutely love this idea i think it is
totally genius i'm totally down with it
when i finish i have just like a little
tiny bit left in my little tube that i
got but i really want a new one because
i think it's such like a quick fix and i
absolutely love that so those are
three perfectly posh items that I've
gotten to review and I really enjoy them
so far I do have more items that i will
be talking about either here on youtube
or on chiclet plus so be checking for
more perfectly possible items left for
my skincare routine but one is what my
regular moisturizer is and I actually
talked about my moisturizer in my latest
beauty haul video because I bought a new
one because I am almost out of my
regular one and i think i have maybe
like two or three uses left but i use
the Garnier moisture rescue of
refreshing gel cream this is what it
looks like and i have been using this
faithfully for several years now they
have this pink ones that liquid is
actually pink and then they have the
green one which is what i just purchased
and was featured in my hall I just go
back and forth between the green and the
pink and says it's for dry skin I'm not
positive if the green one is different
than moisturizer they both smell really
good and I just think they work so well
this is just my moisturizer that has
been my absolute go to for years I
absolutely love it i would recommend it
to anybody look if you if you want to
get it take a look because the pink says
dry skin green might be different but I
have very normal skin and both work
really well for me I use the in the
morning i use it at night i use it after
i wash my face I use like after i get
chemical peels i put on my regular
moisturizer once i get home just to like
get the moisture back in my face after
such a peel and i just i absolutely love
it and then the last two items i were
actually sent pretty recently to review
and these are both from kira dior door a
pura d'Or I'm not sure how you pronounce
that argan oil and one is vitamin C
serum and the company asked me they
actually sent me a shampoo and
conditioner to review but then they also
said they would send me argan oil and
they said you can pick one other product
that you want to review and I was like
vitamin C up in this house please and I
don't know if you noticed and I
you don't know if I even knew this but
as I was reading off like the
ingredients and what any of them had
vitamin C vitamin C is so good for your
skin and I absolutely love having a
vitamin c serum around and I recently
just ran out of one of mine and so when
they said I got a pic I was like yes
vitamin C please and it says this is
anti-aging and increases skin elasticity
and firmness it neutralizes free
radicals and reduces fine line and
wrinkles I love having vitamin C and my
collection for this reason it is really
really good for your face I absolutely
love it this run rational strength
twenty percent vitamin C serum it's
infused with plant-based organic
ingredients designed to target skin
imperfections our special ingredient
blend aid skin to appear tremor was
increased elasticity I've tried a few
different vitamin C serums and I just
got this in the mail like pretty
recently so I've only used it a few
times so I don't have like a firm review
for you yet but i wanted to mention it
because i have been using it as a part
of my skin routine times in the morning
after i wash my face I'll put this on
before I have my moisturizer or
sometimes at night after I've watched on
my makeup off and before I put on
moisturizer I'll put a little bit of
this on sometimes I put it over my whole
face sometimes I just do it like here
between my eyebrows where wrinkles are
pretty common are up on my forehead or
like down by my jawline but i like to
use it all over my whole face too and on
my neck like make sure women that we are
not forgetting our next when you are
cleaning your face or exfoliating or
whatever it is you're doing don't forget
your neck are you excited to keep trying
this out and then the other ones that
they sent me is there argan oil you guys
I am a huge fan of argan oil I can't
even tell you I always always always
have this in my collection when I travel
argan oil goes with me so I was really
excited to try this out from this
particular company and this is for body
hair and face treatment it's pure
natural and organic this suggests to
apply the oil at the daily moisturizer
morning and night as it reminds a he'll
protect and condition from head to toe I
use argan oil in my hair a lot i use it
from a different company this one I've
been using just on my body but I use
argan oil in my hair and oh sometimes
when I'm testing out other hair products
I won't put the oil in my hair just so I
can see you
I want to use products by themselves so
I can give them a fair review and see
how they really work on their own and I
hate not being able to use the oil in my
hair I can tell it makes a huge
difference having using the argon oil in
my hair just makes it easier to maintain
it makes it easier to style I am a huge
fan of argon oil i use this on my nails
sometimes too as well when I take off my
nail polish i will put the oil just all
over my nails and it's supposed to help
build up your nails give your nails
strength just make you have better nails
and I have really like fragile and
brittle nails and so I just started
doing this pretty recently like pretty
faithfully every time at as I take my
nail polish off I put the argon oil on
and so fingers crossed I'm hoping it
turns out for something good this one in
particular for is my body just basically
as that moisturizer like I said putting
it all over my body when I go out at
night I just recently did another batch
well pretty this came with me and I was
wearing a dress and I would put it on my
legs and it makes your legs look like
shinier and smoother I like to put it on
my elbows where I often have a lot of
dry skin the bottoms of my feet I'm
trying to put this on the bottom of my
feet like every single day it does make
it kind of hard because it is an oil so
it's making your feet kind of slippery
so then to walk around it's kind of
comical but I try to do it when I know
I'll be sitting for a while so I can
wait and let it like seep into my feet
and honestly I have noticed a difference
on my feet so far because my feet just
especially in the summer when you're
walking around here there barefoot or in
flip-flops it really takes a toll on
your feet in the bottoms of your feet
and I can tell that this is already
working so already a big fan of the
argan oil and just in general of argan
oil and I'm excited to keep trying the
vitamin C so those are all of the
products that I use for my skincare and
kind of a bit on my skincare routine
when I use in the morning and at night
and as my moisturizer and some of the
other tips and tricks that I do for my
skin I do have a very normal skin it's
not particularly dry and it's not
particularly oily so of advice is to
really again what what works for you and
then stick with it these products I've
been used
first so long I like tried and true that
I use every day I've been using for a
really long time so i know that i can
highly recommend them to you and again
they are all very affordable confined at
your drugstore and at target in areas
like that so i really hope this video
helped you out if you use any of these
products and you love them please let me
know if you have any questions on any of
them that i can answer please do just
comment and ask and I will be happy to
get back to use to know what is your
like one go to skin care product or tip
or trick that you use or can recommend

new ideas and new products to you so I
would love to hear what you use in your
life if you like this video please give

doing a haircare one in the next few
weeks because I've gotten a lot of
