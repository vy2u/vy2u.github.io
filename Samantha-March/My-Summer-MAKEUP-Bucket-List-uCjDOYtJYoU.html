I'm excited for today's video because
we're going to be going through my
summer makeup bucket list so basically I
have a list of items all beauty or
makeup focus that I want to complete or
try by the end of summer 2017 so I got
this idea because me and my friends
actually made our own summer bucket list
a lot of it is like items or activities
around our town that we want to do like
new restaurants that we want to try and
we have been working through the list
these past couple weekend as we are
doing that I am just loving it because
I'm such a list person I make to-do
lists all the times I always have lists
around my house it's kind of crazy but I
love it but it's been fun because every
weekend we're like what are we going to
do look at the list what do we have to
do next and I always say like oh I want
to do this I want to try this I want to
order this I want to whatever it is when
it comes to makeup and I thought why not
make your own summer makeup bucket list
so I have a few items here that I'm
going to chat about that I hope to
complete by the end of summer 2017 and
I'm just excited to share a few of these
things and to actually keep them down
and writing and then put them out in a
video and say I really want to do this
try this by this complete that so I am
super excited to bring you my summer
makeup a bucket list before we get into
that if you're new to my channel welcome
thank you so much for coming by I really
do appreciate it
I do post videos at least four times a
week but as of right now I am posting
every single day which is kind of crazy
so Wednesday's is my will i buy it
series I typically post a vlog on
Fridays and then I also do a live stream
on Tuesdays at 4 o'clock CST and then
I've just been posting content every
single day but I have so much to chat
about I guess it's been a lot of work
with me keeping me very busy which I do
appreciate but I just have a lot to say
and lots of new ideas coming in like
doing this a bucket list but if you have
not subscribed yet I hope that you will
consider hitting the subscribe button
my 20,000 subscriber giveaway is going
on right now as well so that will be
linked in the description box down below
in case you are interested in getting
entered because there is a ton of
products in that giveaway but without
further ado why don't we go ahead and I
will let you guys in on
summer make a bucket list so one item
that I have on my summer make a bucket
list is probably one that is the most
daunting to me but I've been really
wanting to try this out and it is to
recreate a face chart if you guys have
seen these on Instagram I think I want
to say that it started from this milk
1/4 to 2 that is who I consistently see
people post in their face chart tags but
this artist makes the most incredible
face charts such as this and then people
recreate them and I don't know how they
do it like legitimately blows my mind so
here's one so we have the face chart and
then they recreate it it's amazing I've
been seeing more and more of my friends
on Instagram recreating them I think
I've seen a luster look on do a whole
video recreating a face chart and I'm
just going through here's one of my
friends on Instagram like it is so cool
what they are doing but I am super
intimidated by this because I am NOT an
artistically creative person at all so
looking at these face charts and trying
to think how do you even begin that how
you even do that I think what I would do
is definitely try to find maybe some
tutorials like I said I think what's
your lux did one we try to find some
tutorials where people do mind you tube
so I can follow along a little bit
easier I can follow along ok but
sometimes I can't just look at something
and then be able to create it it's super
super intimidating to me but I've been
seeing more and more people do them and
they just look so cool I'll have this
Instagram page link down below in case
you guys want to check it out but again
I just think it's really cool I would
love to be able to try so I'm super
super nervous about it like look how
good these people are is amazing
I would love to a try I would love to
attempt it I don't know how good I'd be
able to do but it's something that I've
been really wanting to do for a long
time so I'm putting it out there and I'm
going to try and recreate a face shirt
this summer it's going to happen other
item I have on my summer makeup bucket
list is to make a purchase from Beauty
lish so many people have recommended
Beauty list to me I've been to the
beauty lush website like almost daily
for the past two weeks because I am
creating an order that I feel good about
what I want to do
make my first purchase from Beauty lish
and then do a big old haul here on my
youtube channel Vila has some amazing
brands on there they have Natasha Genoa
they have uh Nastasia they have Becca
they have ua they have visoreds they
have Charlotte Tilbury I mean they just
have a ton a ton of brands over there
and I am determined to make in order
from them I hear really amazing things
about their customer service like I've
just heard great things about the
website and they have some brands that I
can't find it like Sephora also are
those sorts of places that they have
them on Beauty lish so it's definitely
goldmine to make a purchase but of
course a lot of the items that I'm
mentioning are more higher end brands
Natasha - no no Charlotte so very even
Anasazi and Becca and visored of course
like those are more expensive brands so
it's going to take me a little bit to
get the order in but I'm excited for it
like I said I've been building my car
and building my cart and I'm excited but
I know by the end of summer I will have
my beauty lush haul up on this channel I
am determined one item that I want to do
this summer is to wear a bold lipstick
and I don't mean bold like my lipstick
like bold ish today I don't mean like a
red I mean like a blue or a purple maybe
not green I don't think I expose or not
so like a blue blue is what I'm really
leaning towards and you know maybe I
don't need to like film an entire video
in it but maybe just like a cool almost
like an editorial type of Instagram
photo you know like people just come up
with these such amazing Instagram bucks
and I'm over here like I think kind of
do a winged liner and people just come
out these the most amazing things like I
said I'm not a makeup artist
I'm not artistically creative but I get
so inspired when I see other people and
they come up with these amazing looks
I'm like I really want to try that but
I've never worn like a crazy colorful
lipstick color ever like I just haven't
done it I've never worn a black on my
list a blue a purple a green I just
haven't done it but I have that on my
list and to kind of go along with that
is to post like one of those cool funky
makeup look
on Instagram so it's kind of like a
two-in-one what are colorful bold bright
lipstick and post a bomb-ass code on
instagram to go along with it that's a
goal of mine that's a goal of mine I
just got a big old package from NYX
Cosmetics full of their lipsticks which
was so amazing but there's a blue in
there that am i in that one real harness
what's going to be my apprentice for
this one but I'm excited I'm going to do
it before summer's over I'm really going
to get outside my comfort zone and
hopefully it's good I'm moving on
another item I have on my summer make a
bucket list is to complete and get all
of the items from my makeup wishlist
video about a month ago maybe I posted
my makeup wishlist video and that was
all products that I wanted to buy so
different from the bucket list of like
activities I want to complete these were
items that I wanted to buy and have it
in my collection since then I have
bought some I got a couple sent to me in
PR and I also had a subscriber friend
send me one of the items as well so I'm
almost finished with it actually left on
the list is the Natasha Jonas sunset
palette or at least a Natasha Jamuna
palette I would love to buy it but that
will be in my beauty lush haul most
likely and then also a visor palette
which again that will probably be in my
beauty lish hauls but those will kind of
tied together but on their the Lancome
intense Isola foundation which recently
became available in octoly which is a
site where brands and bloggers can
connect and Lancome did say that they
were going to extend it to me it was a
few weeks ago so I'm not sure if it's
still coming or not but they did say
that they were going to send it to me
for my review the last item from my wish
list that I don't have yet are the
blinking beaut lashes and those can also
be found on the morphe website so I
think the next time I play some work the
order I'm just going to throw the lashes
in there they're super expensive like 35
dollars for the lashes that I want the
Samantha lashes but if I can place them
with my morphe order you know maybe it
won't be as bad I don't know it'll help
me get my free shipping because more
physics shipping is very expensive as we
know but those are just the only items
that I have left on my makeup wish list
so I'm super excited about it that video
will be linked down below in case you
want to see all the other items that are
on my wish list and the ones that I've
been able to check off but my
end-of-summer I hope to have those other
items as well another goal of mine that
is on my summer makeup bucket list is to
finish organizing my makeup collection
and organizing my office you guys have
been watching I've been doing a vlog
series I think I have four vlogs so I'll
link the playlist down below but
basically I'm going through and trying
to organize my collection I got a bunch
of new organizers from my friend Mickey
and I also have a really nice company
sonic assigned me a bunch of like
acrylic organizers and I've just been
going through and trying to turn my
makeup collection into like a legit
makeup collection it's been a lot of fun
it's been hard work because I'm not the
best person at organizing a decorating
like again I don't have that mind like I
can't look at a pile of makeup and be
like I know exactly where I should put
all of you I just don't I just it just
doesn't come to me naturally so some of
the vlogs have been a bit more of a
struggle than the other ones when it's
been a lot of fun doing and I'm slowly
like after last week's blog I'm actually
starting to see like real legit progress
in my office and in my collection which
is so exciting to me but my collection
definitely grew a lot since becoming a
beauty channel last year on YouTube it's
definitely grown a lot and I just really
need it to take time and focus on
getting it organized because my office
is just becoming too overwhelming to me
so my goal is by the end of summer to
have it organized
Ginger's gross and then the final item
that I have on my makeup bucket list for
right now so it was cool to that items
we're adding items to our summer bucket
list as well but last I'm going to have
them go right now is to plan to attend a
beauty event so I didn't think I would
actually be able to go to an event by
the end of summer just a I don't really
know if there's any happening before the
end of summer but be to go somewhere to
fly somewhere to get a hotel somewhere
and that will be a lot of money and I
will need to be able to plan for it but
what I mean by a beauty event is
something such as generation Beauty and
the big like two-day event that they
hold or something like beautycon
something like that I have always wanted
to go to one of those events they look
like so much fun
it looks amazing to be able to meet
other people to be able to meet other
creators to be able to meet other brands
it just looks like such a fun event
thing I would truly love to go to I know
Jen's beauty has quite a few during the
year like they they just had Toronto I'm
pretty sure I think New York is coming
up I think they're going to have some in
San Francisco in LA again I do live in
Iowa so obviously we don't have any
events that come near us and so I always
had to fly and get a hotel room and then
you're talking a lot of expenses there
but I've been working on saving up for
an event and I really hope that I can at
least plan to attend one like hopefully
one will come out I really want to go to
one in LA I've always wanted to visit LA
it's just a place I would love to go to
I have into New York several times so I
would like to go somewhere that I
haven't been yet before so LA or San
Francisco are two areas that really
really interest me in going so hopefully
some of the days will be announced by
then and I can really get serious about
it and plan to attend you know and on
top of your plane and your hotel
obviously you're going to have your food
expenses but then you have to pay to get
into these events as well they typically
you get with a nice goodie bag with
really nice goodie bags from the event
but then also you're probably buying
items in there to us and a lot of people
come in and show what they bought from
their events but it's just it's
definitely a lot of money but I think
it's something that would be so fun to
do and I also do think it's important as
a creator to go because it's definitely
a networking event so I think it could
be something really good for me
especially as you know it's still a
smaller channel to be able to go network
with brands network with other creators
as well maybe get some new friendships
out there some new collaborations out
there I just think it would be so
amazing so I definitely really want to
at least plan to attend an event here
maybe if I do like a fall make a bucket
list actually going to the event can be
on that list but I would love to be able
to give enough money saved get something
set in stone and be able to attend
something like Jen beauty or beautycon
one day in the future because that would
be amazing that's a really big goal of
mine it's a big one it's a big one so
that's over ending with but it's a big
one but it's definitely something that I
would absolutely love to do it so that's
going to be everything up for my summer
makeup a bucket list I really hope that
you guys enjoyed this video or just
found it fun to talk about some of the
makeup goals that I have for myself and
let me know in the comments down below
if you guys have a bucket list just in
general
see I have a life bucket list it's very
long but I do have a life bucket list as
well and I'm like I said me and my
friends created our summer bucket list
and now I have my summer makeup bucket
list I'm telling you I love lists it
just is what it is but let me know if
you have a bucket list summer bucket
list
you have a make a bucket list let me
know in the comments down below what
some of your items are on your list or
some of your goals I would love to know
and I'd love to know if we have any of
the same as well I thought if my voice
is a little strange in this video I have
a huge cut on my lip and it's making it
very difficult to speak immune my dog
knocked heads over the weekend real hard
it actually kind of knocked me out and
my lip is still very swollen and cut all
along the inside because I bit down
through my lip it hurt very bad but I
feel like I've been kind of struggling
to speak because when my teeth kind of
bump against the cut it just hurts so
bad so I'm sorry if my voice is a little
bit muffled or mumbly in this video but
that's what happened and it was very
painful I didn't have a lot of fun at
making this video I had so much fun
coming up with my summer makeup bucket
list and yes just leave me some comments
let me know what's on your list as well
or what you thought about my list and if
you liked this video idea I thought it
would be something maybe a little
different and fun but thank you very so
much for watching I really do appreciate
it I hope that you'll give this video a
thumbs up if you did enjoy it I hope
that you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I'll catch you guys
