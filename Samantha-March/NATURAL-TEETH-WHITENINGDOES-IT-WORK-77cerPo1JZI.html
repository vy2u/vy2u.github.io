today's video is actually going to be
like a culmination of videos but what
I'm doing is kind of an experiment so I
have always struggled with having not
very white teeth I actually just
recently put out a video titled like six
reasons why i'm a bad beauty blogger so
the humorous spin to it but one of the
reasons is because i don't have like the
super white teeth like everybody else
does and it's always been a struggle and
it's always been an insecurity of mine
and I've tried a lot of different
methods I've tried a lot of different
toothpaste and whitening treatments and
pens and not too long ago I actually
contacted like a company that's pretty
well known across like YouTube and
Instagram and ask like hey do you need
someone to review your products like I
would love to try to review them and it
didn't work this company has worked for
like so many other people and they swear
by it and it didn't work for me and I
was chatting with the guy and I sent him
my pictures and he said it looks like
that that's your natural shade of your
teeth and so whitening products wouldn't
work and so that really was a letdown
for me cuz I'm like well what what can i
do to whiten my teeth and I started kind
of like looking around online and I saw
a lot of like the natural remedies and I
thought you know what I'm I want to try
one I just want to try one and see if it
works for me and maybe i can let other
people know like if teeth whitening
products have never worked for you
because when i say nothing has worked
for me nothing has worked for me maybe
we can find something together so i kind
of compiled all of these different ways
to whiten your teeth and i decided that
i wanted to try the lemon and baking
soda method so this is what i'm going to
try to do I've watched several different
videos on it and I've read some articles
on it and I've decided that this is the
1 i'm going to try basically i'll let
you do is that you put lemon juice in
with baking soda and kind of like brush
your teeth with it and then it's
supposed to help naturally whiten your
teeth are warnings with this so i want
to make sure i address them because this
was something that i made sure myself i
was paying attention to lemon is very
acidic and that can be bad for the
enamel on your teeth so just putting
like a straight lemon like biting into a
lemon and holding it on your teeth is
like a terrible thing to do do not do
that
just putting straight lemon juice like
if I would just like to squeeze this on
to my tooth on to my toothbrush and then
brush my teeth with it still bad to do
you want to be mixing in products with
the lemon juice to kind of counteract
the acidity of it so there's a lot of
different things you can do i've seen
some people just mix it in with their
toothpaste I've seen a lot of different
ways i decided i wanted to go the baking
soda way because just the one that stuck
out to me so also with keeping that in
mind this is not something that you want
to do every single day so most people
were saying that they recommended it
about once a week so I'm filming this
first video today it is November third
looking my cubs shirt because they just
won the World Series are you kidding me
that was the most epic game seven ever
that was so crazy but it's November
third I'm gonna try it for the first
time today I'll come back and do another
video next week and then the following
week and I'll probably do either three
or four weeks of this and i will show
you guys my progress as we go because
this isn't something like i don't know
if i'll see immediate results from this
i don't know if i'll see results from
this at all but i thought i would do it
with you guys and share it with you
because i've talked before about like
teeth whitening and how it can kind of
frustrate me people do say that they
think my teeth look white on camera I
would agree my teeth definitely look
whiter on camera than they do in person
but in person like I will insert you
know photos on my teeth so you can see
them they do have like a yellow tinge to
them so and apparently that's just my
natural shade my teeth are not stained
and that's what the teeth whitening
company told me because teeth whitening
products are supposed to remove stains
and nothing is working so so we're going
to try a natural way to change the
natural shade of my teeth so I'm going
to go ahead and mix my lemon juice and
baking soda then I'm going to brush my
teeth with it I'm not going to leave it
on for more than a minute that's kind of
what I've seen as well I leave it on for
a minute or less so I'll probably like
the first time I do it i'm thinking i'll
probably leave it on for like 40 seconds
or so then you'll rinse your mouth out
and then brush your teeth like normal
with your normal toothpaste and all that
good stuff so i'm going to go ahead and
do that and then we'll see what it looks
like after this first time
ok so I am back hopefully I'll show you
the clips of what i was doing one thing
that I also didn't mention was that
after i was done using the like pace on
my toothbrush I did rinse out the
bristles really well before I went in
with the regular toothpaste and I also
decided I was going to use like I like
my regular toothbrush that I use morning
and night in my bathroom and then I have
like my travel toothbrush that I take
with me wherever I go it's just always
in my travel bag in its little
compartment always ready to travel with
me I decided to use that one since I
don't use it on a daily basis just
looking in the mirror right now I don't
think that I see a difference some
videos that I've watched people are like
oh I think I know it's a difference
right away some of them said they didn't
for me myself I don't think that I see a
difference right now but maybe I'll
change my mind after I take the photos
but the experience I mean it wasn't hard
to do is pretty easy to cut up the lemon
and then mix everything together most
people say do equal parts but you just
kind of want to make that paste so you
can kind of add and mix in as you go
along but I didn't do any actual like
measuring because that just not how I
prefer to live my life didn't feel
anything like it didn't have too much of
a taste to me when I was actually
brushing my teeth with it I could tell
there was definitely something like
acidic in there but nothing that
bothered me rinsing and father me
anything like that nothing bothered me
but another reason why I wanted to do
this video over the course of like a
good amount of time I want to let you
guys know if it bothers my teeth like in
the future I do have very sensitive
teeth so when I would try to use teeth
whitening products in the past hey I
want to get whiter teeth but be my teeth
would be so sensitive to the point of
eating anything really hot or really
cold just incredibly painful so I'll
definitely keep you guys informed about
that but again today is November third
so my first time trying the lemon and
baking soda I'll check in with you guys
next week i'll let you know how my teeth
have felt what they look like and then
we will do it once again i do want to
say with this video as well if you
decide to do any of these like DIY
tricks hack suggestions whatever it may
be don't just go off one video I didn't
just watch one YouTube video and was
like I'm going to go mix lemon juice and
baking soda together I watched several
videos I read
articles I did my research I decided
what method I wanted to do and watch how
everybody else was doing there and then
I made the decision to go forward so so
definitely do your research before you
do anything like this I just wanted to
share with you guys my journey see if i
can get whiter teeth let you know how my
experience is so i hope you guys enjoyed
this part and then i will go ahead and
see you guys next week bye hey guys i am
back with another update and then we're
going to do the teeth whitening process
again it is november 11th so it's been
eight days I think maybe since I lasted
the lemon juice and baking soda so i
will insert pictures like keep taking
pictures with my teeth so I'll be
inserting them throughout the video so
you can see what it looks like today
from what it looks like last time again
I haven't done this at all in between
because I like i stress you really only
want to do this like once a week type of
thing but i have my concoction ready to
go i'm not going to show you again how I
cut it up mostly because i'm fighting
the Sun like going down and my husband's
playing music in the basement so I'm
going to try to make this as quick as i
can because i'm sure you could probably
hear what he's doing down there but i'm
just going to brush my teeth and real
quick with the lemon juice and baking
soda mix rinse it and then i'll be back
to chat some more
okay so i am back so form the first week
like right after I did it I was like I
don't know maybe I see a little bit of a
difference but it wasn't anything like I
did it and was like oh my gosh i can
immediately tell my teeth are so white I
was really worried about sensitivity
because that's what I struggle with the
most when I use any sort of teeth
whitening products is my teeth get
really sensitive I've had no teeth
sensitivity like any more than i would
normally so that is good but so overall
I mean that's just my check in after
week one I just did the week to did the
exact same thing and yeah we'll see how
it goes once again like I feel like my
teeth maybe look a little bit wider like
right after I do it but I don't know
we'll keep watching I'll keep taking
photos I'll keep answering them but I
will be back next week for another check
in I will do it once again i will let
you know how it's going if I'm noticing
any differences in the whiteness I'm
noticing anything sensitivity wise
anything like that so i'll see you guys
next week hey hey guys welcome back so
today is Saturday November and 19 have
my baking soda lemon juice mixture ready
to go I'm going to brush my teeth and
then I'll come on and chat with you and
share my photos and all that good stuff
Cheers
so just got done rinsing and then brush
my teeth like normal here they are again
I'll be inserting photos I'm not totally
sure how I'm gonna do this video but
I'll be inserting photos along the way
but here we are week three beso I've
been doing this for three weeks so far
again same routine every single time the
lemon juice the baking soda leaving it
on for about one minute rinsing my mouth
brushing my teeth it's been the same for
all three weeks it's really hard because
on camera I think my teeth look whiter
just in general from like looking in a
mirror in person and then looking at
what it looks like on camera my teeth
look whiter so when I'm here I'm like
yeah they look wider but then I actually
look in the mirror I'm like I don't know
I've been scrutinizing the photos that
I'm taking and I have to say that I
think they do look a little bit wider is
there a huge difference so far not yet
like i said i'm on week three but it's
not something i've been doing every day
because like i mentioned in the
beginning this isn't great for your
teeth so it's not something you want to
do every day you really only want to do
it about once a week is what I've seen
it recommend it so I'm hoping that as I
keep doing it my teeth will keep getting
wider and wider I'd planned on doing
this video for four weeks and doing a
check-in at each week so after four
weeks I'll see where I am I'm glad that
there has been some sort of a difference
I wish it was a little bit more
noticeable quite honestly but to be
honest the prep time and what I need I
mean I buy a lemon once every other week
and then I just used a half a lemon and
it's fine baking soda is not that
expensive it doesn't take long to prep
or brush my teeth or anything like that
so if I do keep seeing results and you
know and I do notice the difference I do
not mind doing this once a week it's
fast easy inexpensive and if it keeps
getting married adults and I'll keep
being happier with that but like i said
i will check back in next week that will
be my last week we'll wrap it all up and
see how we're doing but yeah i'm so far
i'm i'm happy enough with it wish i
would wish i would be seeing more but
i'm ok with it right now hey guys so i
am back for my fourth week and final
check in on my natural teeth whitening
using a lemon and baking soda so today
is
november 28 i am a few days behind on
doing my check-in but thursday was
thanksgiving and then we were traveling
so it's just kind of a busy weekend but
it's monday i just did the whitening on
my teeth so I wanted to give kind of my
final thoughts and wrap up here so the
biggest thing that I realized is that I
finally started to see results at least
i think so and my husband has thought so
the results really seemed to happen
around week three so the biggest thing
that I've noticed with this is that if
you try it you know you can only suppose
you're only supposed to do it the once a
week to not cause like a ton of harm to
your teeth but that it takes about three
weeks to see results the first week I
honestly didn't expect to see results
the second week I was kind of like oh
darn i wish i would have seen something
and then after the third week i was like
oh okay so something is happening here
and now i just did it for the fourth
week so i'm assuming that this week i
will see more results as well but it's
definitely something that in my opinion
and in my experience takes time so don't
get frustrated right away if you're not
seeing results just keep trying it and
it seems like you'll get results down
the road so that was good so i will
definitely keep up with this the pros i
sink to this natural teeth whitening
method is that it's inexpensive you know
it doesn't cost much to get a box of
baking soda and you don't use a ton each
time and also lemons are fairly cheap as
well i just cut the lemon in half and i
used you know half right then and then a
half a week later i just put it in the
fridge and it seemed just fine so it's
inexpensive it's not very time consuming
it doesn't take long to mix it at all
you only have the mixture on your teeth
for about the one minute or so and then
to rinse and brush your teeth I mean it
just it doesn't take long at all so I
like it and it's kind of nice that you
really are only advice to do this once a
week because I think of it was something
that you had to do daily obviously like
that might get annoying like having to
always have like be stocked up on lemons
and constantly like mixing something
every single day putting on your teeth
like that might get kind of annoying so
it's actually kind of nice it's only
once a week because it's just something
that I can work into my like weekly
beauty routine type of thing so that's
not bad at all so those are def
the pros I mean some cons is that you
know it will take you a little bit to
see results I also think that if you
don't keep up with it consistent
consistently you might lose it and I say
that because I was typically doing this
on like thursday and friday so it's been
you know over a week since i did it last
and even on like thursday of this week
on Thanksgiving when I was looking in
the mirror I was like oh great my teeth
look whiter today as I was doing it as
like I don't think my teeth augus white
so I think it's actually something that
you have to be consistent about and do
it once a week or you might lose the
results if that makes sense and I mean
it does like when I say it out loud I'm
like of course you know you need to keep
up with the regimen to you know keep it
so um that's something to that you I
think would want to make note of that
you want to make sure that you're doing
it consistently as well to keep the
teeth white but as far as sensitivity
that was like my biggest concern because
I have super sensitive teeth I have had
no added teeth sensitivity at all not
any so that has made me really really
excited so that's kind of my experience
was trying to naturally whiten my teeth
using the lemon and the baking soda I
hope some of you may be found this
helpful it was definitely a learning
experience for me I didn't know if it
would work I'm happy that I that it did
and hopefully I've been showing some
photos and clips along the way of my
teeth and the differences in my teeth
and you know showing week one before I
started and showing now after I've done
four weeks of doing it instead of
something that i will keep doing like i
said it's not expensive it's not time
consuming it also i definitely want to
keep it up because i would love to have
whiter teeth so i'm curious to know have
you guys tried any natural teeth
whitening methods please leave in the
comments below if you have have you
tried this one is there something that
worked really well for you is there
something that hasn't worked well for
you i would love to know because I
really didn't know about a lot of
natural teeth whitening ways until I
started seeing youtube videos on it and
I was like well wait a second i could
probably do that so I'm excited that I
gave it a try and that was just kind of
my feedback um throughout the way so
again hopefully you found this helpful
let me know if you guys are gonna try it
out over you have a method that you love
and you stick to yourself because maybe
I can give that one a try as well but if
you guys did enjoy this video I hope you
will give
it's a thumbs up I know it's kind of a
different one for my channel but it was
something that I wanted to try it in
real life so I figured why not share it
with you guys as well so please do give
this video a thumbs up if you did enjoy
it make sure you are subscribed before
you go and I'll get your host in my next
one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
