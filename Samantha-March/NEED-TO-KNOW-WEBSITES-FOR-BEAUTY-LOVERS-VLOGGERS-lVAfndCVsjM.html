today's video is going to be a different
type of video basically I have six
websites that I want to share with you
guys that I think that you should know
about this is mostly focused on
influencers like if you're a content
creator a beauty vlogger I have some
websites that I hope that you guys know
about but if you don't I want to tell
you about them but also the first two
that I'm going to talk about are for
anybody you don't have to be an
influencer or a youtuber I have a blog
anything like that so I'm going to share
those two first and then I will go on to
the influencer sites later I get asked a
lot of questions about what sites that I
recommend and then especially with
influencers I just get asked a lot of
questions from them what sites do I use
you know what's trusted what do I think
is the best so there are so many
websites out there not only just for non
influencers bellefleur it but for
influencers as well and I chose my top
six that I want to talk about these are
websites that I use some of them I use
daily some of them are ways to find
brands to connect with to make sponsor
videos some are how to make Commission's
on links some to get cash back how to
get free makeup and and other products
to review so I hopefully this will be a
helpful video to some of you maybe I'll
share some sites that you haven't heard
of or maybe none of them you'll have
heard of or if you're an influencer I
thought hope that you find this helpful
as well my makeup is very dramatic for
this type of video I'm not feeling well
I'm under the weather and so I thought
that I would just have fun and take my
time and get creative and do some sort
of like a Valentine's ish day type of
tutorial for Instagram and then I
actually felt well enough that I was
like I'm gonna film for YouTube as well
and just and just look like this I got
my gold metallic lips and I got some
pink and somewhat of a cut crease my
first ever cut crease that I've
attempted and I attempted to do it on
camera so if you're interested in my
makeup details at all or how I did it
I'll have a tutorial and more
information on my histogram so I'll
leave that link down below but I'm just
marked Beauty word but if you would like
to see the websites that I love and have
to recommend to you then just keep
watching basically like I said the first
two are gonna be for anybody you don't
have to be an influencer or a blogger or
anything like that the first one that I
want to talk about is Ebates
and honestly when I've been planning
this video I was like I'm not
to talk about Ebates because everybody
talks about Ebates everybody knows what
a bates is and then yeah like week that
I was really planning out this video and
how I was gonna film it someone I was
talking to someone on my snapchat and I
suggested to her she was asking about
Ulta and I said hey I'll toes like 10%
cash back or something on eBay so make
sure you use eBay and she said what's
eBay it's now I was like no not
everybody knows about you Bates yet so I
wanted to add events in here ie Bates is
basically just where you can get cash
back for shopping online they have
recently introduced and in-store feature
but I have not tried that yet myself so
I'm gonna talk about only doing the cash
back online basically all that you do
with Ebates you'd go to ebay it's you
would make your account and then like
for me before I go to place like say yes
Sephora order I type in ebates.com and
then my Sephora is always like right
there you can search for the store up
top but mine's usually right on like the
right hand side I click Sephora and it's
really great because on there too it'll
also tell you like coupons and different
discounts that are happening which is
really nice if you don't know that so
you can find coupons and stuff there but
then you just click like I want a shop
or take me to shop or visit the Sephora
site whatever it is that that button
says and it'll pull up the Sephora
webpage for you and then you just shop
like normal there's nothing else that
you need to do then once you checkout
you'll get a certain percentage of cash
of cashback you will see on the e-base
website it'll tell you right there what
it is a cash back at that store there's
a lot of days where they do like double
cashback and you know it's just randomly
like Sephora will be 8% and Ulta will be
10% and I've even seen like up to 20% on
some stores I mean they have Sephora
Ulta I just did a border with Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond they just have so many different
retailers on there it's just such an
easy way to get cash back I think it's
like every three to four months you can
either get a check in the mail or they
send you a PayPal deposit of your cash
back and then it's just you just get
your money back I mean it's super simple
it's super easy I feel like everybody
talks about it and raves about it
because it works there's no sort of
scamming it's I mean ever since that I
signed up it's worked for me a hundred
percent I've never had any sort of
issues with it and I love getting my big
fat checks I think is what they call him
I love getting them I think ones coming
up and
you arey and I can't wait because I know
that it's that it's up there that it's a
lot of money so I will leave a link
below to Ebates it is a referral link if
you sign up for Ebates you would get a
referral link as well and I suggest
sharing that because I think you get
like money if people sign up I think
I've only gotten like one credited
referral and I think that was my mom so
but yeah if when you sign up you know if
friends are family that you know don't
have a Bates yet give them your referral
link and then you can get a little
something-something too for having more
people sign up but it's just one of my
favorite websites and I highly recommend
it so the next site that I want to talk
about is Influenster I talked about
influencer a lot on my channel the
really nice thing about Influenster is
that like I said you don't have to be a
blogger and influencer have any sort of
like social media presence to sign up
with influencer or anybody can sign up
with it and with influencer basically
what you'll do you'll go in you'll
create your account they asked it for
you to take surveys and I think they're
called snaps in the Influenster website
or they also do also have an app that I
would recommend downloading but you take
these snaps and they kind of get to know
you and what it is you like what it is
that you would prefer to review and then
when they have a box box ready to go if
you like prequalify they'll send you a
survey and you would fill out the survey
and then from whoever filled out that
survey however many number of box boxes
they have if whoever matches the best
gets the Box box so I have gotten a lot
of stuff from them I've gotten
Maybelline makeup I just got a bite
Beauty box with lipsticks and lip liners
in it I've also gotten like more random
things like food and things like that
like I found big boxes like filled with
different types of stuff it's really
cool I know someone just said to me the
other day that they got like dog food or
I was like what come on dog food not for
me obviously but I have a dog but it's
just a really nice way to be able to get
products and like I said what they do
after you get sent a box boxes they
asked you to complete certain tasks such
as posting a photo on Instagram of what
you got reviewing on Amazon or Sephora
or wherever it is that you got the
product from they typically want you to
review it you know share on Twitter etc
etc and you want
complete these tasks because then you
can get entered to win more products
from a certain brand or you can get
entered to get qualified into other box
boxes they have Twitter parties a lot
it's really nice I like the concept of
it you get to be able to try things out
I like that it is for everybody and that
you don't just have to be an influencer
influencer is definitely another good
one I'll leave it link down below I get
like a referral point or something if
you sign up under the referral link but
yeah the influencer was another one
that's good for not bloggers so next I
want to talk about sites that are good
for influencers I have four sites that I
want to touch on the first one is one of
my like favorite ones it is called magic
links I am somewhat new to magic links I
think maybe I've had my account for like
four to six months maybe somewhere in
that time frame I honestly don't
remember how I found out about it I
think it was in one of my Facebook
groups that someone mentioned it but
basically it's like an affiliate program
type of thing where you would get a
commission on your links so basically so
in my videos anything that I talked
about or products that I use I leave on
linked in the description box down below
there are some retailers that are on
magic links so if I'm linking to
something say at Sephora I would find
the product on Sephora and then I would
make it into a magic link on the magic
links website and then I would put that
in my description box so when someone
then clicks on that link and then it
takes them to Sephora and they make a
purchase then I get a certain commission
from that purchase if that makes sense
so I've been finding myself really
liking magic links they appear to be
growing pretty consistently as well and
more and more retailers are hopping on
them so it's nice because you know we
make these videos and really I mean you
do make a little bit from Adsense like a
little bit not a lot but it's nice to
also find another source of revenue for
one making these videos because it takes
a lot of time energy and effort to make
them and then not only you know you buy
the camera you buy the lights too you
buy the products that you're talking
about so it is nice to find these little
ways to help kind of get some of that
money back whether it's you you know
using a program like eBay or now using a
program like magic links where you can
actually see and what I have found
really interesting about magic links is
seeing what it is that people are buying
what it is people are clicking on
retailers they're clicking on and seeing
where
audience you know where they want to go
what websites that they want to see what
products they want to see what they
actually want to buy it actually it's
giving me knowledge into my youtube
channel and I just think that it's been
really helpful I
I do support magic links I actually just
got my first check from them like I said
I think I've been with them for like
maybe six months I can't quite remember
but I haven't been with them for a super
long time and I already got my first
check so I think that's really really
cool really helpful I know that that
some people can get weirded out with
these like affiliate type of links I
guess I don't but you know I started in
social media in 2009 with a book blog
and I've been an Amazon affiliate ever
since then and I use Amazon affiliate
links all the time I mean it's not a
huge amount of money that you give back
but every little bit helps
if anybody has any questions on magic
links or my experience with it or
anything like that please just leave it
in the comments below and I'd be happy
to answer them I will leave the link for
magic links down below
it is a referral link but I'm not
exactly sure what the referral reward is
I'm not positive I think I've maybe
referred like one person but I don't
think I've seen anything from it but
just so you know that it is a referral
link down there if you don't want it you
can just go to magic links comm and sign
up for it yourself but I definitely
suggest if you're someone who is you
know constantly recommending things or
you know you have a youtube channel or
Instagram or whatever it is I would
definitely look into it it's been a site
that I've been really really loving and
that I would highly recommend I go to it
almost every single day myself so magic
links I think is a great one the next
website I want to talk about is more
ways to get free products and this
website is called octa Lee I think it's
called actually it might be called
octoly I've heard people pronounce it
differently but I was just watching
their snapshot the other day and one of
the gals on there that works for octal
II said octa Lee so that's how I'm gonna
say it but don't hate me if I'm saying
it wrong but you do need to be an
influencer to be a part of this site
they do have certain guidelines that you
need for your Instagram or your YouTube
I think for I'm not sure actually I was
gonna say I think it's this and this but
I'm really not positive so I would
suggest just going to the actally site
yourself and checking out what their
different guidelines are but they do
have a certain number of subscriber
counts that you would need to have
reached for your social media
farms before you're able to join
actively but what's really cool about
them is they have what's called a free
store once you sign up with it and once
your account is approved you can go in
and you can pick out items that you want
and then they send them to you I say
free but a lot of times when if I talk
about companies sending products that
just influenced our now actally it's not
really free it's in exchange for your
review for your social media promotion
for talking about it etc but after you
pick something out so let's say I've
forgotten quite a few items recently one
of them was from colour-pop like a color
pop eyeshadow and hydroplane so I see
color pop in my free store I find
hydroplane I click on it and then a box
pops up and I get to tell color pop what
exactly it is that I'll be doing for my
promotion where I'll be promoting it out
what I'll be doing so I say you know I
have this many followers on Instagram
and I would love to create 2 to 3 posts
on Instagram including one video
tutorial showing a demo of how I use the
eyeshadow etc etc you basically want to
sell yourself to them you want them to
send you that free product so you do the
best you can in that box as to say why
you're a good fit for them and why they
should consider sending that product to
you and then your request goes off to
them and then the company can either
approve or decline your request some
approve some decline color pop I have
probably submitted two color pop five
times I've been approved three times and
I've been declined
two times I believe is what it is some
some brands approve you every time some
brands never approve you some are more
like half in half so if you get declined
you know oh well
try again next time it's okay if you get
accepted what the what they'll do
they'll send you an email saying it's
been accepted then you get another email
saying your product is shipped once it's
been extent accepted your clock then
starts and you have 21 days and you have
to do your review so typically the
companies are really fast at shipping
because they understand that you are on
the timeframe because a lot of these
things it's not like you just get it and
then you take a picture of it you're
like oh look what I got they actually
want you to review the product so you
need to test it out so immediately once
I get a product from actally I'm trying
it out whether it's skincare whether its
makeup whatever it is I'm immediately
getting it on my face trying it out
testing it out and making sure I can get
my review because it's within 21 days
you need to post your review
I have my Instagram hooked up with octal
eh don't have YouTube yeah I just have
my Instagram and then basically once I
make my Instagram post I then you just
copy and paste the link on your
Instagram post and then there's a
certain spot in your octal a account
where you would then submit that and
then you're good to go so when I first
joined actively I was like you can just
you know get all these free products
like that's really cool they do have a
system to it it's like a method to the
madness because otherwise I just
envision people getting like 20 and 30
free products all the time and like it's
like how would you keep up so basically
when you sign up with your account you
get five stars five octal eight points I
don't really know what the column but in
like the upper right hand corner of your
octoly screen you'll see like a yellow
star and has a number in it so you start
with five if you request a product it
goes down to four until it's a if it's
denied you get that back if it's
approved that stays away until you
submit your review once you submit your
review it goes back if you have all five
requests out there or you have all five
reviews pending out there you can't
accept you can't request any more free
products and I get it and I appreciate
that I think that's a really smart way
to do it I think five is a good number
because honestly there are times where
I'm getting so much from actually that
I'm a little bit overwhelmed because it
takes time to review things it takes
time to post your pictures it takes time
to write your reviews and then get
everything all together so I think five
is great but actally I mean I've gotten
stuff from colour-pop dr. Brandt Clarins
I just got a nail polish from OPI I
highly recommend octoly if you can I
definitely will suggest trying it out
again I'll leave a link down below again
it is a referral link and I get referral
points if you do use my link to sign up
but I'd be so grateful because I think
you can actually turn your points into
like Sephora gift cards or Amazon gift
cards I'm pretty sure I don't have
enough points to do that so I'm not
positive but I would always be so
grateful if you would use my link
regardless I would say check it out and
see what our qualifications are and how
close you are to qualifying you can
always sign up for the I believe it's
still this way that you can sign up for
an account even if you're not approved
they'll like keep you on file and email
you when you do get approved that's
what's happened to me when I first
applied I wasn't approved and then I got
an email from them saying hey you're now
proved here's your account I was like
cool thanks so
I would definitely recommend checking
them out just getting your your name and
their file but yeah it's such a great
way to be able to get products in
exchange for review and I highly
recommend actally the last two sites I
want to talk about are how to find and
connect with brands to do like sponsored
videos so the first one that I want to
talk about is called grapevine and again
I'll leave it linked down below I don't
think there's a referral and career fair
isle sister system for them but
grapevine was the first website that I
found and how I did my first sponsored
video it was with it was with
Scandinavia which I have gone on to
really love the Scandinavian sprays but
basically in there you make your account
you would link your YouTube or Instagram
whatever it is that you're going to link
I believe they do have certain
guidelines as well but they aren't quite
as high as octoly and then they have I
think it's what's called the marketplace
in there and then all the brand's who
are looking for influencers and content
creators to connect with they have on
there what it is they're looking for and
then you come in if you read it and you
think it sounds good and you work with
them you would then create your own
proposal you would kind of say you know
who you are
why you want to film with it what type
of video you're gonna film with it are
you going to film a tutorial a haul a
Tryon if you're going to film it are you
going to film something indoors outdoors
you know it just helps to give as much
information as you can
I always put in there like look kind of
camera I used to film with I use I put
in like my editing software I put in you
know I'll make this YouTube video and
then I'm also gonna do to post on
Instagram or I'll put it on my snapchat
or my Instagram shirt whatever it is in
as much information as you can sell
yourself let the brain know that you're
dedicated that you want to do it you
would also have a spot to put in how
much money you are asking for to create
that sponsored video and then the
website that I use to get my fees is
called social Bluebook I'll leave it
listed down below no referral link there
but social Bluebook is really
interesting because you connect your
social media accounts and it tells you
if you're gonna make a dedicated video
on YouTube this is how much you could be
asking for same with Instagram I think
it even has Twitter on there as well and
that's where I get my
my fees from that I'm sending out to
companies so that's all in there if they
accept you then you would get an email
saying that you've been accepted and
then you can chat through the brand back
and forth through there usually they'll
have you send your video unlisted to
them first which means that only people
like if you would make your video unless
it on YouTube and you would send them
the link only people with that link
could see your video so the brain would
watch it first approve it have any you
know request that they want to send you
or anything like that and then you would
post it live and then you would get paid
from that brand you would get paid
through the grapevine so it's kind of
nice because you have a third party in
there and they do take a small fee but
that's told up front once you enter your
feet it'll say then you would get paid
this much after grapevines be nice that
you do have that third party in the
middle looking out for both sides
they're protecting the brands and
they're protecting the content creators
which is very cool but also a good part
about it I think is that you are getting
your names out to brands like I've had
brands contact me after I've contacted
them through grapevine and they've said
you know hey we weren't able to you know
do the sponsor video with you but we
still have this product that we could
send you for review and then you can
decide from there you know would you
want to do it that way
so yeah that is the first one that you
can connect with brands to make sponsor
videos and then the second website and
last website that I want to talk to you
guys about is called famebit I'm pretty
new at a famebit I've only been on there
maybe the past three months or so and I
have done one sponsored video through
them it was the social wall unboxing and
famebit I don't think I like famebit as
much as grapevine like the dashboard
doesn't make as much sense to me just
like little things like that with
famebit what I've noticed and we're
talking with other influencers it's very
strange because so many the companies
come back and like yeah we want to work
with you but not pay you at all and I'm
like well then why are you on favorite
because this is the point of fame it's
to bring brands and contact writers
together to make sponsor videos and
there's a fee involved so why are you on
here like it's very confusing so that
part to me has made faint bit like I
just don't like it as much I don't
understand a lot of the braids on there
and what it is that they're trying to do
and what it is that they're trying to
pull but again I've had a couple brands
reach out to me separately because you
know your email
in there and your social media
information is in there which usually
has your email address I've had some
brains reach out to me and say like you
know hey we didn't have enough marketing
money for everybody but we still wanted
to reach out and you know send you this
product or send you this discount or
whatever it is so that's been nice but
that's definitely another way that you
can find brands to create sponsored
videos with if that is what you are
interested in doing so grapevine and
famebit are the two that I use the most
and those are the final two websites
that I wanted to talk to you guys about
all right guys so that is gonna be
everything for this video I hope that
you found it helpful whether you're an
influencer or not blogger I hope that
you found it helpful and maybe learned
about a few new websites that maybe you
didn't know about again everything that
I talked about will be listed in the
description box below if you have any
questions on anything that I mentioned
please just leave me a comment and I am
happy to answer that I read and respond
to all of your comments like I said this
definitely isn't all of the sites out
there that would just be like a four day
long video but I just wanted to pick the
six that I use the most that I utilized
the most and that I recommend the most
but please leave in the comments down
below as well what websites that you use
both as a blogger and on blogger I would
love to know I'm sure there's some sites
out there or apps or what-have-you that
are really good to use as well so we can
let everybody else know and maybe I will
find a new one as well and I apologize I
still am getting over this cold so my
voice is probably a little bit crazy so
I tried to get through this video as
fast as I could so in case I was talking
super fast that is why now I need to go
wash my face and lay down because that
took all of my energy out of me again
this a makeup look should hopefully be
on Instagram if I got some good footage
so if you're interested I'll leave it
linked down below as well but thank you
guys so much for watching I really do
appreciate it I hope that you will give
this video a thumbs up if you liked it
or found it helpful
please make sure to subscribe before you
go and I'll catch you guys real soon in
my next one bye
