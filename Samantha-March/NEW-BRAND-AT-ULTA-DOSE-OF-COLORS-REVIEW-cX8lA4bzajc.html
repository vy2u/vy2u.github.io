today's video is going to see all about
a new brand that just came to Ulta it's
not his new brand it's a new brand to
Ulta and I was so excited Alton is
getting all of these brands in and is
making me super pumped but when I saw
Joseph colors come to Ulta I was like
got to make myself a purchase and I did
so I wanted to talk to you about the two
different items that I picked up review
them let you know what I think of them
let you know if I think that they are
worth it so of course the brain that I'm
talking about is Joseph's colors I
picked up their marvelous and loves
eyeshadow palette and then I also picked
up one of their liquid lipsticks in the
shade stone so I'm going to go through
both of these products but you know what
I think of on the swatch um I also do
have some clips to insert of me doing
this makeup look I have the eyeshadow
palette on my eyes and of course I'm
wearing a stone on my lips I'm super
excited to share my thoughts with you on
this brand and on the items that I
picked up so if you would like to see my
review and thoughts on dose of colors
please keep watching okay so dose of
colors has been a brand that I have
wanted to try for a very long time I've
mentioned in the past will i buy videos
I actually talked about the marvelous
mob in a past video and I said I wanted
to get it I just really struggled with
doing it I definitely am someone who
leans more towards buying a Sephora or
Ulta or brand websites such as hearts
that have reward programs I'm very much
into wanting some sort of point system
or discounts or something because I
spend a lot of money on makeup I buy a
lot of makeup to review for my channel
so if I can get some sort of kickback
even just having like eBay's something
to help me out I really do appreciate
that
so when I saw that dose of colors is
coming into Ulta I knew immediately I
was going to buy from them and I thought
these products the day that they
launched on all those website because I
was just so so ready for it with the
eyeshadow palette first again this is
the marvelous mops eyeshadow palette
this is what the outer packaging looks
like and then on the back we have the
shades and the shade names this was a
$32 and you get five different shades
which I consider to be pretty pricey and
that was kind of why I struggled to
purchase it when it first came out on
the dose
our website I just it seemed like a lot
of money for five different eyeshadows
and because I had never tried to dose of
colors I really didn't know what to
expect from the brand so here is what
the outer packaging looks like looks
this and then on the back again just
like the box that has the shades in the
back when you open it up it does have a
mirror in here and it does come with a
double and just brush which is somewhere
you open up the eyeshadow palette you do
get a mirror and then you have your five
different shapes so obviously this is
the mob palette so the shades are in a
mauve shade range and they go from
lightest to darkest in the palette they
enjoy how like sleek and compact this is
it seems to be very easy to travel with
and it also seems like good quality so I
at least appreciate the fact that we're
paying thirty two dollars for five
eyeshadow palette but we're getting a
double into brush and we're getting a
mirror and we're getting solid solid
packaging I really do appreciate that
when I opened it up I really did fall in
love with these shades I thought you
were so beautiful I was really excited
to get them on my eyes back and forth on
if I should get the brown one but
because I had just bought the Tarte clay
play palette which is full of brown
eyeshadows I thought maybe I shouldn't
do it but I'm really actually very happy
that I picked up some off one I think it
is really really gorgeous and these are
more of like cool tone shadows I was
just talking to someone in my will i buy
it video that I put on Wednesday and
they were saying all these really warm
toned pallets are coming out and they
want something cool tone if you like
mauve this is a really great cool tone
palette to show you some swatches
these are Effie first four in the
palette here is the final shade in there
but there are these swatches the latest
four and then the darkest one over here
so you can see I just did finger
swatches and they showed up very very
nice these shadows are very pigmented
first time I ever tried this palette I
grabbed the second shade right there to
put it in my crease and I you know it
looks like a light shade so I dubbed my
brush in there and I was like oh I could
have covered both of my crease and
eyelids on both eyes with the amount of
shadow that I picked up and it's just
kind of like you know that was my
regular mount that I would do
any other item palette these are very
very pigmented and they show up very
very well I was incredibly impressed by
it one of the first things I did notice
as well though is that there is a ton
ton of kick up with this palette when
you dip your brush into it you are going
to get powder everywhere I have to blow
off the palette after I put my brush in
something when I get it on my brush I do
tap my brush off a lot to make sure I'm
getting that excess off but I did notice
any actual fall out on my face which
made me happy I did watch something in a
close video she reviews both of the
palettes the mob and the brown and she
mentioned that I think she said it with
Anna the owner of Delta colors said the
k-cup happens because there is like
stamp marks in the eye shadows and that
causes there to be the kick up so so I
would mention that because I learned
that from Stephanie's video how doesn't
that appreciate that there there wasn't
any fallout on my face like I didn't
have purple everywhere after I finished
with this so with how pigmented these
are I mean I was super impressed I don't
care if I fall out all over the palette
as long as I don't have all over my face
I'm going to be a very happy camper the
shadows are also incredibly easy to
blend they work well together in that
aspect it kind of reminds me a little
bit of the Kat Von D shade and light
palette those are some of the easiest
outs that I have to blend and they all
work very well together and I would say
that's what these eyeshadows remind me
of I was very impressed I've only had
these items for probably just over a
week now I want to say but I've been
putting them to the test if you see me
wearing a lot of mauve in my recent
videos it's because I really wanted to
be able to give an actual review I
didn't want to do a first impression I
wanted to be able to review these items
and let you know if I think that you
should get them if they're worth your
money so I've been really wearing these
a lot and doing different color
combinations and just seeing kind of
what else I can come up with with these
shadows and every single time I've used
this palette
I have been very impressed and I have
been very happy which I'm super stoked
to say so again here are some swatches
on my hand I mean you can tell just by
the cyclin even that was super light
shaped a lot of times those really light
shades just simply don't show up in a
swatch and that one does and I think it
is so so pretty
I did for my makeup tutorial today I
grabbed the second shade and I put that
in my crease I grabbed the third shade
and put that focus in the outer V and
then slowly into the crease as well
I grabbed the last shade here I grabbed
the second-to-last shade here and put
that just on the outer V of my eye I
didn't bring it in at all that's just
focused on the outer V and then I took
the darkest shade and smudge that on my
lower lash line with a little bit of the
third shade as well and then I took at
this first shade and I put that on the
inner part of my eye and I also used it
to highlight my brow bone and then also
the inner corner of my eye and I
actually am like super obsessed with
that lightest shade which is totally
weird that what to me would not be the
shoe that I was gravitating most towards
but it is so just beautiful on the eyes
it's a beautiful highlight shade it's
beautiful for the inner corners it
almost it's not and I want to say it's
iridescent because it's really not but
it almost kind of gives off that v and
just kind of brings the whole eyelid
together and it's truly one of my
favorite show you from appellate which I
know it sounds like so weird but it is
just so good there's really not a bad
shade in here though
I've been messing with all of these
shades for the past week now and there's
really there's not a bad shade in here
they are all so pretty and blend so well
I have been so so impressed with this
eyeshadow palette and what's great too
is that I even do like the brush this
isn't going to be my go-to brush for
every single eye look that I use if you
know we don't have a fluffy blending
brush on here or anything like that but
what I like to use this side for is to
what I did with that first shade is I
put it on the inner corner of my eye and
I also use it for the brow bone and
inner corner highlight it's just a nice
like flat kind of dense brush and it
worked perfect for that and then the
other side is more of a pointed brush
tip and what I use that for is to smoke
out the shadows on my lower lash line
and it works perfectly and I like it you
know I'll keep this brush with this
talent and every time I use it that can
be the brush that I go to for when I'm
using the palette I mean it's a small
thing but to me I just appreciated it
and a lot of times with brushes I find
myself
not really liking them and I thought
this brush was just fine like would I go
out and purchase this brush no with the
next addition to the palette and I will
continue to use it so between the
fabulous shades how low they are how
pigmented they are how well they blend
out how well they show up and then just
the great packaging of the mirror and
having a good brush this to me was
totally worth the $32 and I'm so so
happy I got it I think I will go ahead
now and purchase the brown palette as
well because I just am completely
impressed with this and just so very
happy with it I would definitely
recommend this palette for $32 and I
think that you're getting really good
quality so I would definitely recommend
the eyeshadow palette from dose colors
so then the other item that I purchased
from dose of colors at Ulta is one of
their matte liquid lipsticks in the
shade stones is what the outer packaging
looks like again I have heard so much
good things about the dose of colors
liquid lipsticks but of course stone is
like one of those cult colors that just
everybody wears and loved so this was
definitely the first liquid lipstick
like there's no doubt in my mind which
one I was getting here is what the outer
packaging looks like and I think these
liquid lipsticks like just packaging
wise I think are gorgeous it's like that
frosted glass it just it feels nice and
one thing that I will say so these are
$18 so that's you know more pricey for a
liquid lipstick as well the eyeshadow
palette for $32 at least their packaging
is on because sometimes when you pay a
lot of money for something and then you
get you get the actual product and it's
like cheap or flimsy it's like what so
at least the packaging is on point that
is a plus number one but like what the
eyeshadow palette it was just all great
I gave it an A so that was good so for
the actual color tone is that beautiful
pink nude dusty mauve I think is what
the actual description of it is it's
just it's a meat color it's just so many
other people's color it's just that kind
of like your lips look better I mean it
is just a seriously stunning color there
is a swatch of it on my hand in case on
my lips just isn't doing it enough for
you
there's a swatch of it here's what it
looks like on my lips I've been wearing
it in my three other videos you're
seeing it a lot and I love it it's what
it's I just don't want to get off I do
want to wear this all of the time it is
so so gorgeous but for the actual
formula as well I have to give another a
it is very long-lasting I will say that
once I eat for dinner last night oh oh I
don't really want to say this now on
camera I attack with jobs okay okay okay
I had a mean potato burrito because I
have salad for lunch so I got me some
Taco John's at night and I ate Deborah
Dell and my lipsticks still looked good
like yes it wore away slightly in the
center I'm not going to say it in it but
it still looks pretty good for eating a
burrito so this is what the applicator
looks like it has that little dent slant
in it as well and one thing that I
noticed when applying it it applies so
smoothly like it just glides right over
your lips and I don't need like I only
need one application of this for my top
lip and then one for the bottom lip and
it just like I don't know that was one
thing that caught my attention when I
first put it on it just glides on over
the list it isn't I don't know just the
application of it I was impressed with
the actual formula it's long lasting it
doesn't feel uncomfortable on the lips
it's not one of those super drying
liquid lipsticks that I just hurt your
lips it doesn't wear away within five
minutes of wearing it it can last
through dinner I just I'm so very
impressed with the formula for $18 these
are definitely worth it I love it I
highly recommend it I get it I get that
high I get why people talk to up dose of
color liquid lipsticks I get why they're
talking up stone I understand all of it
I'm here to put my stamp of approval on
it if that means anything to you I'm
putting my stamp of approval on not only
the eyeshadow palette but the liquid
lipsticks as well very impressed I will
definitely be getting more if they have
a huge shade range of their matte liquid
lipstick I would highly highly recommend
for $18 I definitely do think this is
worth your money I am so happy to say
that Vince dose of colors purchase from
all the beauty worked out so
well for me I highly recommend both the
eyeshadow palette and the liquid
lipsticks if you've been considering
purchasing from dose of colors and now
maybe that is that also your interest is
even a little bit higher I definitely
say go for it yes the prices are a
little bit higher but they are worth it
in my opinion after testing these out
for about a week and wearing them and
trying to wear them non-stop and testing
them a lot of different ways I do have
to say a big yes I would recommend these
products very impressed very happy will
definitely repurchase it from dose of
colors I just I really enjoyed both the
eyeshadow palette and the liquid
lipstick so this was a win for me I'm
super excited for that I'm excited to
find a new brand I'm excited to sign new
makeup that I absolutely love this was
so much fun I'm really happy that I
decided to make that choice colors for

one thing that I didn't mention yet for
dose of colors and also a lot of the
other new brands that are coming to Ulta
is that most of these are going to be
online only again when I was watching
Stephanie Nicole's video she just says
that you know the actual physical stores
only have so much space and especially
for new brands it's almost like they
kind of have to prove themselves and
prove that they can move inventory in
order to get a spot in the actual
physical stores so right now dose of
colors I know like Mac and some of the
other new brands they are going to be
online only if you order online don't
forget to you see base also is always at
least 3% cashback if not more so I
always empty base link down below don't
forget to you that your cashback is
super easy you want to make sure that I
pointed that out so you don't go looking
