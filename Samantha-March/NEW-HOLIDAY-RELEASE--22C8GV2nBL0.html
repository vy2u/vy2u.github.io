is going to be just a short one but I
have another announcement to make it is
so exciting I feel like I'm doing these
videos more frequently which is just
incredible but of course the big
announcement is that my publishing
company marching ink has released a new
book I'm so excited for this one it is a
collection between I have a novella in
there so does cat lavoie who just
released Perry and progress and then
also laura Chapman has two novellas in
here and she is the author that recently
released first and goal so it is a
holiday collection and it has four
novellas in it so for like short stories
and it's called all i want for christmas
there is the cover you guys can see that
and i'm so excited for this because
holiday collections are I feel like
they're getting more and more popular
people are really loving them and I love
the idea of having like the novellas in
there because they're just little short
stories if you just want to like get in
the mood real quick you can go into your
collection you can read a short story
and then you can feel all hopped up on
the holiday spirit again at least that's
what it does for me so we came up with
the idea to release the collection it is
now on sale on amazon barnes noble and
Kobo so you will get for holiday themed
novellas inside so basically you will
get making Christmas and this is one by
Laura and this one I thought was really
cute because that we follow IV who has
basically decided to make like a
grown-up holiday advent calendar like
she has a different activity for each
day leading up to Christmas that she's
going to do whether it's like I skating
reading a certain book you know things
like that and she meets the guy Everett
and she it's kind of interesting how of
course they come to it but they decided
to take it on together and of course
there's romance ed it's just super sweet
and then we have nine ladies dancing and
this is by Kat lavoie and this one is
chiclet again and do we follow casey
ooh she has decided for whatever reason
that she's going to plan their holiday
office party after the woman who
normally would plan at she retires so
Casey takes it on but what's really
interesting about it is that like she
does not like Christmas she does not get
in the holiday spirit and then she's
kind of like why did I take this on but
part of the reason why she did is
because of course there's a man involved
in in her reasoning and so we follow her
trying to plan this party trying to get
the attention of the guy and then she
does get the attention of the guy but
does it all work out mmm you'll have to
see you and then the next one in there
is the Christmas surprise this is by me
Samantha March this one is more on the
serious side and I think I've mentioned
my videos before that I love chocolate a
read Chiclets i have a blog called
chocolate plus but i do not write
Chiclets well I don't write light easily
and I really tried I actually had a
different idea in mind for this novella
that was straight-up Chiclets about a
wedding and I just couldn't do it so
this one is a little bit more serious
just so you guys know but it is about
Juliet who she basically like thinks her
husband is having an affair and she's
going through trying to figure out if he
is like trying to read his actions like
smell them when you come home you know
all those sorts of things and in the end
we find out what exactly does the
husband has been up to and all that good
stuff so I hope you guys enjoy the
Christmas surprise the last one is what
happens at midnight and this is Laura's
second novella in here this is where we
follow natalie and basically I really
loved this novella because yes the
chapters kind of each start out the same
way in the beginning and it's all
following Natalie at New Year's Eve and
for the same several years in a row she
like meets the same guy at the same bar
and it's like he kind of like saves her
from situations each year and then they
decided to meet like they actively
decide like hey let's meet next year at
the bar like to see what happens like
you we can have a relationship and then
the book continues to the novella
continues to play out from there
of course i love all four of these
novellas in here I really do hope you
guys will check it out it is only 399 on
amazon barnes and noble and Kobo we do
have the paperback is not quite ready
yet I'm still waiting for my proof to
get to me but it should be on sale as
well in paperback really shortly so only
399 for an e-book that is a little bit
more from like our regular full length
and novellas that we know from our
reading they're fooling books that we
put out this one is just a touch longer
so um so it's priced at 399 four
novellas in there all holiday themed I
hope this helps get you guys in the
holiday spirit if you guys have any
other collections or holiday themed
books that you like or you can recommend

have been supporting marching in here on
YouTube it's really incredible to just
have a new outlet to be able to talk to
you guys about books it's so amazing to
find so many book lovers on here I know
this is a books and beauty Channel and
some people might not think that these
two go together but the more I see
feedback from you guys and the more I do
my research on youtube like mixing books
and beauty is not unique like I guy I
don't think that I'm unique at all in
what I'm doing because there's so many
other people out there who have such a
love for the both books and the beauty
side of things and to combine them
together is really great so it's it's so
fun to be able
see the book lovers comment on here that
they love the books but then also like
the makeup artists on here and the
beauty bloggers on here that are also
saying hey I love that book I got that
bug congrats on the book it is so
amazing so thank you guys so much for
all the support that you have given
marching inc we have so much more coming
up for you in 2016 so stay tuned because
we're going to have a lot of great books

wonderful day thank you so much for
