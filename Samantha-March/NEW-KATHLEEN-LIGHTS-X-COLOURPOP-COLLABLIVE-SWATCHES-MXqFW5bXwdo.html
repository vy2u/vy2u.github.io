today's video is an exciting one because
I'm going to be going over the new
kathleenlights and color pop collab that
they did so she came out with three
lippies and then also an eyeliner which
really excited me because I'm such an
eyeliner junkie I did pick all of them
up the only thing that I didn't get they
came out with the liner in two separate
forms in a pencil form and then also in
the platform personally I do not like
the color pop eyeliners and the platform
I've tried him for myself I don't like
them other people like the reviews
aren't great on them so I did not pick
those up but I did get pencils and I
picked up doubles of everything because
I'm gonna go through and do a first
impression and swatch everything for you
guys and like kind of let you know my
first impression feedback but then I
also have the entire set so the three
lippies and the eyeliner and pencil form
that I'm going to be giving away to one
of you guys stuff let's go ahead and
open everything I literally just got
this in the mail and opened up the
package and I haven't so watched
anything haven't taken anything out of
the boxes yet but let's open it up one
other thing in addition to picking up
the kathleenlights collab I just want to
run through it real quick I don't want
to spend too much time on it though but
look at how cute this packaging is I
picked up the mile-high shadows so
inside oh it comes with a mirror -
that's cool and I believe these were
coins as like some of the six like
best-selling super shock shadows from
colour-pop so I'm really excited for
this go over them too much in detail
actually because I'm not going to be
keeping all of these I really wanted
millionaire that's such a popular shade
and I know a millionaire is in here but
there's also some in here that I
actually already own so some of these
shadows are going to be going into my
5000 subscriber giveaway so I don't want
to swatch everything because I'm not
sure which ones I'm gonna keep from
myself yet and which ones I'm gonna put
in the giveaway but I did pick this up
it's $25 for six eyeshadows so basically
it's like it's getting one eyeshadow for
free but I was really excited and now
that I got this box like that's like
super cute packaging this is the mile
high I shadow get it to like pinkish
lipsticks and then one is kind of a
brown I'm going to start off with Alyssa
and on the website this is described as
a neutral dusty pink so here's what that
looks like now these are all three of
the
these are the ultra satin lip so I
actually do not own any of the ultra
satin lips and I'm really really excited
to see what I think of this formula so
here is a swatch of Alyssa
I mean exactly how it's described of
course a neutral dusty pink that looks
so pretty for like every day ooh yeah
that's really pretty okay I like that I
like that well on the website because
I've never tried the ultra satin lips it
says it's a lightweight bold lipstick
with a satin finish it's supposed to be
super comfortable and healthy satin look
for the lips and it's supposed to have a
crazy high percentage of pigments for
extra intense color saturation it's
extremely long wearing although not
completely kiss proof so it doesn't dry
it completely down like a matte lipstick
would but it's still supposed to be
really really long-lasting and more
comfortable than a matte lipstick so I
am really curious to try this I think
I'm gonna put like I was only gonna do
one on my lips but I mean I only have
three to swatch and I don't think
they'll be as hard to remove as the
matte lips so why don't we just swatch
them all so I'm going to put Alyssa on
my lips
you
okay so this is Alyssa on my lips this
is a gorgeous color I could immediately
tell upon application that this is a
much more comfortable formula than the
matte lips and that really excites me
because I do love matte lips but not
always or how they feel on my lips so
I'm gonna be really excited if we can
still get long-lasting plus more
comfortable though I do have two other
colour-pop lippie is that I want to
swatch next to them and see what they
look like so the first one that I'm
going to swatch next to Alyssa is
clueless clueless looks like a much like
more Mavi pink where Alyssa is
definitely more neutral and I also have
sallow to swatch as well this is much
more bright pink so you can see Alyssa
is the first one and then clueless and
then sallow so definitely all three very
different but I thought maybe this like
color swatch comparison it could help
you out but so for the first color this
is Alyssa I think it's such a beautiful
pink like if you guys are one who loves
having neutral pinks in your collection
like myself I think you are really going
to love Alyssa I actually I'm also gonna
swatch Kandy K from Kylie cosmetics
because everyone's always trying to find
a dupe for Kandy K um I don't think this
is going to be very similar either so
Alyssa is here the first one and then
Kandy K is the last watch there you can
see Kandy K as much as like a deeper
tone pink where Alyssa is still like the
more totally neutral so again we have
Alyssa
clueless sallow and then Kandy K from
Kylie cosmetics okay so I'm going to go
ahead and wipe this off and then we'll
jump into the next color but the next
one I'm going to go through is November
and on the website it says this is a
mid-tone warm peachy pink it sounds so
nice I'm so excited about these colors
you guys like I am so excited I'm gonna
keep swatching on the same hand so we
can get like this pink color family
going on so this one right here is
November so again we have Alyssa
clueless sallow candy K and then
November and as it's drying down I can
you tell that November has a little bit
more of like a warm tone to it and I can
see the peach starting to pull through I
don't know if you'll be able to see it
as well on camera but the like the warm
peach that they describe it as is
definitely starting to pull through a
little bit more let's go ahead and put
this on my lips
so this one is November this is gorgeous
okay so I like as it was drawing down on
my hand I saw the peach tone come
through but immediately when I put it on
my lips I could already see the peach
coming through and I absolutely love it
I think is so gorgeous like I feel like
I just want to keep staring at myself in
the viewfinder but this one I think so I
loved Alyssa and I thought it was such a
fantastic pink but I might even like
this one a little bit more I love that
little peachy vibe to it I can't wait
I'm gonna pair this one with my
two-faced sweet peach palette and it's
gonna be amazing
that's probably what I'm gonna do
tomorrow and I just can you guys see
like how excited I am this is like a
true true first impression video but I
am so excited I love this one this one
is November and like I said I just had a
Lissa on for a little bit in between
swatches I was like taking pictures and
stuff like that and I was letting it dry
on my lips a little bit more so I could
kind of get a better feel for the
formula because I've never worn the
ultra satin lips and immediately I can
tell that it's so much more comfortable
than the ultra mattes
again this one is November mmm-hmm this
one is just gorgeous
the last lippy from the collection is a
point zero and this is described as a
cool toned gray Brown which like really
excited me I'm not gonna lie I do love
Browns
well this one is cool okay and cool and
cool tones it's cool and cool toned okay
so here is a point zero so I also
grabbed out beeper and trap from
colour-pop I don't know if these will be
like similar at all okay so there is
point zero and then this one right here
is beeper so you can see it like truly
they're really not that similar like
when I first started watching them like
know they're they're totally similar
they're really not beeper is much more
of like a warm tone I'd say and darker
like this is definitely super super cool
toned and then the other one that I
grabbed out was trap this is like I
don't know maybe this is more of like
the gray
more entrap and so long this used to be
like my faith on the cooler side but
it's almost like a gray pink maybe so
yeah these are really not super similar
at all so once again we have point zero
beeper and trap from colour-pop so there
are a few comparison so watches right
here and let me go ahead and put point
zero on my lips
and then here is point zero on my lips
such a cool color this probably is not
going to be for everybody if you don't
like cool tones lipsticks and you're
definitely not going to like this one
because this is on this super super cool
tone side but I just think it is so much
fun I'm really attracted to the brown
lips and I'm attracted to the gray lips
and that's one thing that I honestly did
not think I would be and once I tried it
out I was like there's no going back so
I love this one I love all of them I'm
so excited I love all of them my first
impression try them on
watching them and seeing what they look
like on me I love all of them and that
is really really exciting to me if I
would have to pick a favorite like just
right now I have to pick a favorite like
I haven't even been able to look at the
photos that I've taken haven't really
been able to like look at myself in the
mirror yet but just based on like the
little that I've had I think my favorite
is gonna be November that one like
really stood out to me I really love
that one but seriously all three of
these lippies I am so impressed with for
these ultra satin
lips these are all $6 a piece on the
colour-pop website at the time that I am
filming I'm looking at the website and
they are all in stock so if you want to
pick these up I will leave them linked
below but all of them are in stock you
guys have tried the ultra satin lip
squeeze do leave in the comments below
and let me know what you think of this
formula if you like it better than the
ultra mask because I'm so excited to try
these out
but yeah so these are all three of the
lippies and now I'm gonna go ahead and
swatch the eyeliner as well the eye
liner is called mr. Bing from friends
and it says on the website it is a rich
warm brown and a matte finish so like I
said I love eyeliners so much and I love
brown eyeliners I love Brown and
Kathleen was saying in her I think was
her video that she did that this is a
very like warm almost a reddish brown
eyeliner like it's not just like a
standard brown eyeliner here is the
swatch you can tell that is a rich brown
color that is awesome oh I cannot wait
to use this this is going to be amazing
I love the color pop liners I have
probably five or six now
and I stand behind these all the way and
these are only five dollars I truly
think these are the best eyeliners for
the waterline they stay on so long I
think these are gems I don't hear a lot
of people talking about them and I have
no idea why I love them they have a huge
array of colors I have like fun ones
like green ones and lilac ones like I
just think they are so bomb and for only
$5 you cannot beat it like I said I
don't like the ones in the pot form I
did try them out for myself I did not
like them at all I wouldn't be able to
recommend them so that's why I didn't
buy it and really do you need the same
eyeliner in two different forms I don't
think so so for my preference I went
with the liner and that's also what I
bought you guys for the giveaway as well
but once again here's that swatch of mr.
Bing and it is utterly gorgeous it is so
gorgeous I am so excited to wear this I
will be using these in an upcoming
tutorial and I just absolutely cannot
wait so my first impression thoughts on
the new kathleenlights and colour-pop
collab is that this is freaking bomb
this is so bomb I'm so excited I decided
to get it
kathleenlights is one of my favorite
youtubers I just think she is incredibly
down-to-earth and just I love watching
her videos I have purchased her Lumiere
2 and I absolutely love it and I was
just so excited to see these to see the
ultra satin formulas and to see an
eyeliner like I'm so excited for this
eyeliner and I'm so so pleased to say
that I think all of these are amazing I
really hope the swatches and the
swatches on my lips helped you guys out
as well if you are still thinking about
getting the collection or maybe you'll
only want to get a color or two colors I
hope these swatches helped you out but
truly from my first impressions I think
this is such an amazing collab I'm so so
happy I bought it and also this is
extremely affordable again the ultra
matte are six dollars and the eyeliner
is five dollars like you cannot beat
that and like I mentioned everything
