today's video is going to be a whole
bunch of makeup reviews I'm just gonna
be reviewing a lot of new makeup
releases here I have the Mac and Patrick
Starr collection the Kristen LeAnn with
urban decay collection I have new
products from Sigma the balm dose of
colors and I have been trying everything
out for quite some time so I could get
my full reviews together so we're just
gonna be doing one bake review video
most of these products were sent to me
in PR but the dose of colors palette I
did purchase myself from Ulta but if you
are ready to see a bunch of reviews on
new makeup releases or what I'm gonna go
ahead and get started it's like I said
this is this might be a longer video
because I have a lot to take you up
through when I get to new makeup
products whether I buy them or whether I
get them in PR I like to really try them
out for a while before I come on and
make a review videos every once in a
while I'll do a first impression video
but I'm very upfront that it's a first
impression video and I think it's kind
of fun to try out new makeup products
but I always come back to do reviews so
you very rarely see me do a video on
like what's hot and new at the moment
because I just would rather give a
review because I love watching reviews
and I think reviews are helpful so with
that being said jumping into it the
first collection that I want to talk
about is the one with Mack and Patrick
Starr I really could not believe that I
got the collection I still kind of can't
believe not kind of I can't believe that
I'm on max of PR list I don't get
everything from them so whenever I do
it's always like oh my gosh can't
believe I got this but to get the
Patrick Starr collection I thought was
really really exciting Patrick Starr as
a fellow youtuber as well and that's
such a it's really cool to see him do
the club with Matt get was awesome with
the products of that word my favorite
and these are the eyeshadow quads
now I was a little like if he going into
trying these because I recently tried
out a MAC eyeshadow palette it was
called a fashion fanatic palette and I
actually put it in my underwhelming
makeup products video I believe it was
because I said I've always heard really
good things about Mac eyeshadows I felt
like but when I tried that palette I was
really underwhelmed but I didn't think
the shadows performed all that well so I
was kind of like I don't know so when I
saw these I was like mmm are these gonna
be any good I don't know and truly they
are my favorite from the collection and
I really enjoy these I took them
traveling with me the last time I went
back which one did I take I took this
one traveling with me when I went back
which is called the glam AF palette and
yeah I just have been reaching for these
a lot I think that these shadows in here
are much better than the other palette
that I tried from Mac for sure so this
is what glam AF looks like so of course
it is my kind of tones so here are the
swatches of the glam AF a palette I am
NOT a swatch master by any means but
those are what these swatches look like
and I think this is just such an easy
palette to dip into I love that I have
the matte white to put all over my
eyeshadow primer to highlight the brow
bone with I love coming in with I think
this one is settled right which is like
it really like well-loved well-known Mac
eye shadow I love putting that one in
the crease you can deepen up with this
use it on the lower lash line and then
we have a really nice kind of like pinky
champagne shimmer color which i think is
gorgeous so I think this is the palette
that I've been getting the most use out
of and like I said I did take it
traveling but I think these eyeshadows
are fantastic I was much happier with
these than I was in the MAC eyeshadow
palette it's $32 for four shades which
that is a bit on the pricier side to me
but these can also be found at Ulta and
I know Ulta does have a 20% off coupon
right now and it does include prestige
brands if you are thinking about
grabbing this one you could use your
coupon with it but I really enjoyed the
glam AF but the other palette I do enjoy
just as much and this one is called the
goal getter
palette so this is a bit of a close up
of this one so I enjoyed that we we kind
of are still getting neutral shades in
here so if you're someone who likes more
colorful I have a collection coming up
for you to talk about but if you like
the more neutrals I mean this is what
this collection I feel like is really
based off of but again I still really
enjoyed these shades at this very
neutral prompt and they so I also really
like this palette for these kind of like
moggy tones because I tend to lean
towards mauve tones quite a bit and then
that gold is really beautiful as well
here are these swatches from the second
pellets you can see that this one swatch
is really well this is a really nice
really kind of like deep purple mauve
like burgundy shade and the gold is
really beautiful as well so you know if
these are more your tones
would say go with the gold getter
palette but I really enjoyed it both of
these quads and I find myself reaching
for them quite a bit
these would definitely be my favorite
out of the collection now has anybody
tried these eyeshadow palettes from the
McIntosh up star collection but yeah I
really have been enjoying these ones and
getting a lot of use out of them but
next up in the collection we had an
assortment of lip products so it came up
with a three regular lipsticks three lip
glasses and then also three lip pencils
so the regular lipsticks are seventeen
fifty each and we have a pink shade
which is called she better work and then
we have a bit of a deeper nude which is
called mama star we also have a red
which is called a Patrick Wu and then
there are also three lip glasses or lip
gloss type formulas and these are all
seventeen fifty each as well and then
each name corresponds with the regular
lipstick so we have the pink the nude
and then also the red so here are what
the swatches look like and then I also
did swatch out the lip liners filip
liners are 1750 the lip glosses are
seventeen the lipstick is 1750 I will
have all of that in the description box
down below but the pink lip liner is
called edge to edge and then we also
have mahogany and then the kind of like
deeper red is called brick and these are
regular lip liners to Mac and they are
just also a part of the collection if
that makes sense but again these are
these swatches so I really enjoy MAC
lipsticks I really enjoyed them I have
quite a bit of them and I wear them very
frequently so I really do like them
actually my favorite is the pink which I
did not expect to enjoy the pink as much
as I did because I thought it would be
way too light on me this one is the she
better work and I really enjoyed I've
been really into Pink's lately though so
that could be why but I've been finding
myself wearing this one quite a bit and
I really do enjoy it
the nude is also really nice the red is
a little bit too it's almost like too
bright for me it's not my personal
favorite right on me but I also don't
wear red lips a ton so my favourite
would actually just be in the line that
it is she
to work mama star and then Patrick will
like Mack the lipsticks these are the
same formula to me the lip glasses I
also really do enjoy
I don't think Mac lip glosses are my
absolute favorite I've been trying out
more and more recently I was just
talking about my recent will I buy a
video that I've been kind of being drawn
over to the side of lip glosses so I've
been trying more and more I still like
the formula I just don't think it's one
of my absolute favorites and at $17 I
think that's high so I personally think
that's a little bit high for a lip gloss
but these are pretty decent and they're
they're decently pigmented as well I
mean you can tell in the swatches that
they have like some good color payoff to
them so if you like a lip gloss that
does have a lot of color umph I think
that you would like these because
they're not too sheer or anything like
that
just to me I would prefer the lipsticks
but again I feel like these are the
exact same formula as the regular Mac
lip glasses so if you love that formula
you would be getting them with these and
again like I said these liners are the
staple liners to Mac's so I did enjoy
the lip products again preference wise
for me would be the regular lipsticks
the lip glasses and then the lip pencils
I just don't really wear lip pencils a
ton and with these lipsticks I don't
find that you'd need them there are some
lipsticks or a liquid lipstick formula
that like you need that look lighter to
kind of even things out or smooth things
out and I don't think that you need it
with the Mac a formula but and I think
17 dollars like for me that's high for a
lip pencil because I don't wear them a
ton if you're someone who gets it kind
of use out of lip pencils you know that
probably makes more sense but for me it
really doesn't but especially if you
like lighter pinks I think that one is
just so pretty and I've been really into
it but yeah I really enjoyed the lip
colors I liked that we got kind of like
an array of different colors it wasn't
too nude it wasn't like too bold or
things like that so kind of whatever
your preference would be but I enjoyed
the lip products I just seemed like the
biggest a space cadet in this video
that's because I don't have enough
really bad day if you follow me on
snapchat you know what day I'm talking
about but wow I've already deleted a
clip for this video I've been dropping
everything we're not we're not having a
good day so apologize if I seem fool who
stays on another level but the last item
that I
to talk about from the collection is
actually the one that I was most excited
about I honestly thought about
purchasing for myself and then that was
really excited when I got it in the pr
package but this is the Patrick's powder
it's the setting powder I did check it's
not available on the Ulta website
anymore but it is still available on the
back website hopefully I am pre filming
a bit but hopefully it will still be
it's $34 and I will have any of the
links down below I honestly don't know
why this was the the item that excited
me the most because I love lipsticks I
love eye shadows but for some reason I
was like yeah the setting powder and I
really don't even use setting powders a
ton anymore lately I used to use them
way more frequently like last year but
for some reasons this one was calling to
me and then I started seeing a bunch of
reviews come in from those who are also
getting this in PR and everybody had
amazing things to say about this and I
was so excited the first time that I
tried it I was like yes I get it I
understand why people are excited this
is the bomb good very large little item
here and I don't know if you'll be able
to see what the powder looks like
without spilling it everywhere but it
actually has a bit more of like a pink
tinge to it than I thought it would it's
not completely colorless I don't know if
I will be able to see like I don't know
it's it's not completely colorless I
mean it's a setting powder I don't know
if you'll be able to see it on my hand
or not but like when I put it on my
sponge and then I also apply it with
brushes like it does have a bit of
pinkness
to it I tried it on my under eyes and
then I also tried it all over my face
and probably the first two times that I
tried it I was like oh my gosh I'm so
into this it looks really nice made
everything look really smooth I was like
yes and then I got really really really
dry skin and used to this and oh no I
looked horrible
so I normally have a pretty normal skin
but I live in Iowa and we went through
an extremely rough dry patch I mean I'm
talking like our high was negative 2 and
3 degrees my skin suffered so much like
to the point where my skin actually
would hurt because it was so dry it
physically hurt so this on dry skin is a
no-go because it emphasized everything
and I remember there being a day where
like I
trying everything to combat the dry skin
because like right dry patches were out
of control and I remember there was a
time where I was like okay my skin
finally looks better and it like doesn't
look as bad and then I put this on and
boom every single dry patch came back I
was like oh what have I done to myself I
think if you have dry skin I would avoid
this or I got super dry I did think it
was nice if you have normal skin or
maybe if you have oily skin I really
never have oily skin so I can't really
say but especially if you have normal
skin I thought that it did look nice
especially still right now even though
it's starting to not be as frigid as it
was here in Iowa I do I am still dealing
with dryness so I just have not been
able to use this one at all which is a
bummer but I'm gonna keep it around and
I still do enjoy it and when my skin
kind of calms down I think that I'll be
able to wear it again but definitely if
you are dry or have mature skin I would
say stay away from this guy $34 you do
get one ounce of product in here though
I'm gonna hold on to it I can't use it
right now but maybe in the next few
months I can come back to it so next up
I knew I shadow pellet that I would send
it from the balm is their latest
eyeshadow palette this is called meet
mat maker and it is a 2950 oh man do I
really like this eyeshadow palette this
is what the inside of it looks like it
does have a mirror and then you have
these shapes here I love the balms
packaging I think it's super cute so I
thought this one was really cute cuz it
has kind of like your layout already in
here and I say that I'm not someone
who's like artistically creative and I
really enjoy palettes with this type of
layout it just makes it so much easier
for me when I go into it and I've really
been enjoying this palette I did do some
swatches on my arm here I will say that
before I start filming this video i went
through i swatched everything I filmed
close-ups of it and as I went to
transfer the file I deleted it instead
telling you guys I'm having a great day
but I did do some of the swatches here
on my arm as well so this is what the
swatches are from the palette looks like
and I have been using this one a quite a
bit lately and I have just been enjoying
it so much one of my favorite looks that
I've done in a very long time is when I
was using these ones right here to our
the mat and the Kate duo in the palette
I loved that look so much I'll insert a
photo here that I put on my Instagram of
a close-up of the I log and I thought it
was absolutely gorgeous I've used almost
every single shade I would appear I've
used matte and Pat I've used Matan Alex
Jamie this beautiful green I was wearing
that in a video I've used the purple oh
yeah and I've you said I think I have
use every single shade okay excellent
that's what I try to go for sometimes
especially when there's still money I
can't quite get to them all but I have
used every single shade on my eye I
enjoy all of them except for Matt Wong
here that one is not so great and I did
swatch it on my hand it's this one right
here and you can kind of see like that
one is not so great it didn't have a ton
of pigmentation and it kind of was just
more patchy but everything else in here
I felt like performed really well and
I've been having a great time at playing
with this palette for 2950 I definitely
do think that this one is worth it I
like the mirror I like the packaging
I like the shades inside I like that we
have neutrals we have Pink's we have
gold but then we have this really nice
purple and really nice green too I think
this one is definitely worth it I've
been getting a lot of use out of this
one I can see myself traveling with this
one as well and yeah I think this one is
a really nice quality I would definitely
recommend meet match maker from the balm
but next up I have a new product from a
sigma that i want to share about and
this one I think is really freaking cool
this is called the Sega magic scrub now
Sigma Beauty to me is best known for our
makeup brushes I think that they are
fantastic but they also have a really
nice a brushed care cleaning line as
well the cig magic brush shampooed that
which comes in a liquid and then they
also have foam they have a lot of like
maths or mixed or gloves to clean your
brushes on they have towers to clean
your brushes on and store your brushes
like they have a lot of options and they
recently came out with the Sigma jig
scrub and when I got it I at first I was
like hmm am I gonna love it will it be a
little bit too on like the gimmicky side
I'm not sure let's try it out and from
the first time I tried it I was like
nevermind I understand I get what we
were going with the Sigma and thank you
for this so on the back you have these
little suction cups also insert an
Instagram video in the description box
down below a link to the video that I
did showing a demo of this but I like to
stick it kind of towards the back of my
sink and then this in here
is the brush cleaner so there's nothing
more that you need to do you literally
just get your brush wet and then swirl
it on here and is cleaning your brushes
and I think it's fantastic it's super
fast it's super easy
it's basically hands-free as well
because instead of having to hold a bar
of soap or something like that or
holding another sort of cleaner you can
suction this to your sink so you don't
have to use your hands and you're free
to just clean your brushes it's a really
quick it's really easy and it's only $19
which I didn't think was a bad price at
all so I think that's really cool and
I've been getting a lot of use out of
this one it's just been sitting on my
sink and then when I'm ready to go I
have a few brushes to wash I'll just
stick it to my sink and then start
cleaning them and I think it's fantastic
so I think this one is super cool and it
does also have these kind of like
grooves in here so it's actually
cleaning your brushes at the same time
it's getting in there and it's removing
any of the makeup it's also killing the
bacteria Sigma is also really good at
using all natural products which is good
for your makeup brushes especially
because then your makeup brushes are
going onto your face so you want to make
sure you're using good ingredients to
clean your brushes as well since then
those will be coming in contact with
your face so I thought that was pretty
awesome I've used this one now probably
five times I will say and I mean I don't
feel like it looks like it's hardly even
been used it's really really fast and
really easy and I just enjoy how
convenient it is so that's what it looks
like after a handful of uses again it's
$19 I am a Sigma affiliate if you use
the code Samantha you will save us some
money on this guy as well but yeah
cleaning brushes it's not the funnest
job ever but it's something that you do
have to do when you have something that
makes it easier to clean your brushes
with and quicker to clean your brushes
with I think that's a pretty good thing
so next up I have some lashes to talk
about I featured these in I think it was
a first impression video so I wanted to
come back and review them but I did get
the full set of morphe lashes in PR and
I have been trying them out I love
lashes I wear lashes very frequently so
I was really excited to get that package
because it was a lot of lashes and I was
like yay lashes for a life I love it so
morphe just recently released their
lashes they are ten dollars each and
they have a ton of different styles on
there of course they will be a link down
below so what do I
these lashes what I think is kind of
where what I said in the first
impression video what I said in that
video was that they are hard to apply
they would look really nice on though
and I liked them with the way they look
I like the way that they feel when
they're on but they are a challenge to
get on and I love lashes and I wear
lashes almost daily like for me to
struggle that much with the lashes I was
like what happened here and I will say
one thing about these lashes is that I
think that they are easier to use after
you've used them a couple of times the
band is really thin on these which
typically is a good thing but when they
are too thin a it can be hard to put
adhesive on it and the first time I was
using this adhesive was literally
slipping off the band and sliding down
onto the actual lashes because the band
is so thin I recommend using something
like the House of lashes eyelash
adhesive where it's a brush on adhesive
versus like the duo which I normally use
where you actually squeeze it out of the
tube because it's the the band is so
thin that it it's actually kind of hard
to work with but for some reason I don't
know what it is about these lashes they
just I have a tough time getting them to
stick on correctly and it's almost like
they have one of those bands where the
inner corner constantly flips up like
when I put the lash down I typically put
the lash down and stick it down on the
middle and then I come to the outer edge
of the eye and stick it down and then I
do the inner part but I can't because
when I put these on the inner part of
the lash shoots straight up and sticks
to like the middle of my eyelid and I'm
like what's happening here and I have
tried I think four or five different
styles now of the morphe lashes because
I wanted to try them out test them out
you know yeah maybe that one pair didn't
work the best for me what about this
pair I've been trying them out and it's
the same thing with all of the lashes so
I'm like what in the heck and I try to
flatten out the lash band of myself you
know you can kind of stick it on your
hand to try to help take away some of
the curve that doesn't seem to be
helping so I don't know what it is if
you are a lash newbie I really can't
recommend this because I think that
you're just going to like be scarred for
life with lashes
and if you're someone who struggles with
lash application I don't know I don't I
don't know if you're gonna like these
either because they are just a challenge
to get on it's almost kind of to the
point where when I start to stick it
down I also have to then take my finger
and make sure that I'm pushing the inner
part of the eye down and when I went to
do this I look today it's a bit of a
more complicated I look and I was also
filming it to have a mini tutorial on
Instagram and then I came in and I was
like I really don't want to use the
morphe lashes today because they're so
hard to apply and they can ruin makeup
looks but I'm like you're reviewing the
morphe lashes you should at least have a
pair on and so for some reason I also
chose one of the harder pairs which is
called Romancing that's what I have on
my eyes today I don't know these lashes
aren't really the best for me but again
for some reason that I'm having one of
those days where I'm making all of the
wrong decisions and I decided to put
those on and I it was I almost had to
start over so that wasn't the most
genius move so if I don't have a super
complicated I look on that took me
forever to do or something like that or
if I just have more time then I will
reach for them because I like that the
way that they look and they're super
super lightweight because the band is so
lightweight like it doesn't feel heavy
on the eyes and half the time that I'm
wearing some of these lashes I feel like
I'm not even wearing lashes at all
they're very lightweight I get a lot of
compliments when I wear them and even in
that first impression video a lot of
people are saying I know you said you
struggled to put the lashes on but they
look so nice on so it's kind of like I
now have a love-hate with them I love
the way that they look I don't love how
you get them on and that's you know you
kind of need to get them on before you
can love the way that they look so it's
kind of a toss-up my two favorites that
I enjoy are called a total babe and then
also hypnotic they went else try the
morphe lashes and am I the only one
that's struggling because man I really I
struggled to get these on almost every
single time I struggled to get them on
but yeah that's what I would recommend
it use something that has a brush
adhesive and just take your time and and
just be aware that that inner corner is
probably gonna pop up when you are
applying it so just be aware of that but
I don't know for ten dollars that's not
a bad price at all my favorite lashes
are the pure lashes and they're $14 so
there are $10 you can get them on the
morphe
website and I know a lot of people have
more fee codes so you could get a bit of
a discount with them as well but they
are not my absolute favorite I'll keep
wearing them but some of my favorite
styles but they're not my favorite pair
of lashes they're not gonna replace my
pure lashes or anything like that and I
just I wish that they were easier to get
on if anyone just tried these and you
get them on super easily I'll leave your
tips and tricks down below cuz this guy
was gonna read them oh my goodness you
guys so I went to grab out my dose of
colors assessee Siena's palette and just
had to spend 15 minutes searching all
over my house with it and found it
underneath my bathroom sink I must have
been holding it when I went to find my
makeup wipes and for some reason instead
of just carving my makeup wipes I like
exchanged it with this palette and I
couldn't find it anywhere I almost had
to scratch it from this video because I
couldn't find it this day is no good and
when you film edit and upload every
single day you don't really you don't
really just get to scrap it and start
over so Hauser's what Wow but I have the
new palette here from dose of colors
this is called the sassy siennas palette
I did feature this in my alcohol and
Tryon video so I will have that one
linked down below so you can see what
the shadows will look like on my eyes
and all of that and I do have a swatch
photo on my Instagram so I will have
that insert it over here so you can see
what the swatches look like but this
palette is the bomb I really don't know
what else I should say I also have the
marvelous moths palette from dose of
colors and I speak so highly of that one
I did purchase this one myself it was
$32 on the Ulta website $32 is pricey to
me for a five-pin eyeshadow palette but
I'm telling you that the dose of colors
I chose are simply worth it if you have
your 20% off coupon with Ulta right now
and you've been thinking about this use
your 20% on this and save a little bit
of money but honestly I've paid $32 for
marvelous mops and now sassy siennas and
I don't regret it the shades are
fantastic I actually even like the
little brush that comes with it you can
see that I have pigment on the brush
because I do use these brushes as well
does have a mirror it's really nice and
easy to travel with it's small and
compact easy to travel with I don't
worry about the shadows breaking and the
pigmentation on the dose of colors I
show pellets are unreal I will say that
you do get a lot of kick up in the pan
with this
but I very rarely experience any sort of
fallout on my eyes when I did the
alcohol Tryon video you can see that I
don't have orange all over my face or
anything like that when I was using this
palette and the shades in here are
absolutely beautiful if you like kind of
these vibrant oranges I'm a little bit
of coral colors and then you also have
some Browns in here as well you're gonna
love this palette I mean it's just it's
worth it dose the color says something
so right with their eyeshadow palettes I
feel like they've been getting a lot of
hype recently I saw a lot of the
eyeshadow palettes mentioned and like
bust up videos and things like that and
I mean it's just because they they are
they're just great so the Saks a pianist
palette I've been wearing it frequently
as well and I think it's just as
fabulous as I thought it was in my
alcohol and try on video all right so
last up I have the urban decay and
Kristen LeeAnn collection to talk about
I once again I was so excited to get
this in PR I was not expecting it at all
when it came I got super excited because
the palace insides look gorgeous there's
a highlight palette in here I was like
oh my gosh thank you so much Urban Decay
this is amazing and it was so crazy
because I put it on Instagram and Chris
and Leanne actually like DM to me back
and said like thank you and I hope you
enjoy it I thought that was so cool no
one else has ever done that so I was
like oh okay thank you thanks like
Congrats it was I was such a weirdo but
alright I don't even know where to begin
with this collection because honestly
it's just the bomb I'm just gonna I'm
gonna throw it out there and say that
this collection is the bomb but first up
I want to talk about this highlight
palette this is called the beauty beam
highlight palette it's $34 the
collection is now available on Urban
Decay and then also Sephora and Ulta so
I will have it linked down below this is
what the highlight palette looks like so
you have three shades and it does also
have a mirror and then here are what the
three swatches look like and I mean if
you can tell from the swatches there
this palette the first time I used it I
was like yes yes yes yes yes yes
because I love the Urban Decay sin
highlight all I've been so hyped for
that highlight I mean I feel like
everybody knows I love it and I went on
and I purchased that were in a Kon s
afterglow highlight palette and I did
quite love it as much as I loved sin but
this this I love this palette I do have
it on today I have the middle shade
on the middle shade here and then this
last one here these are what I mostly go
for or sometimes I mix them together
this one is too dark for me right now
but you know maybe in the summer when
I'm a little bit tanner I can come back
to that one but these two especially I
am just I mean like it's so beautiful
you barely have to have any product I
can use a fluffy brush but this one
actually I prefer to use a more fluffy
brush with this versus a dense brush
because when you go dense like it is
that you are seen from space I love this
palette if you like a blinding highlight
check out the beauty beam again it's
just it's I love it but next up in the
collection there are two eyeshadow
palettes and this one here is called the
daydream palette and it is $26 you get
five different shades you do also have a
mirror and then it comes with a
double-ended brush I don't mind the
brushes they're not my favorite and
sometimes I honestly just kind of forget
to use them but there are brushes
included in here as well this palette is
such a nice kind of like a neutral
everyday type of palette you have a
really soft pink here you have two
different tones of Browns one's a little
bit lighter once a little bit on the
warmer side you have a really cool kind
of like pinky Coralie type of color and
then also at first when I looked at this
one I thought maybe it was just a brown
but it has a bit of mauve tones to it as
well here are the swatches from that
palette and you can see I mean
everything swatches really well this is
a really nice palette I think it's
really nice to wear alone and I've
created looks alone with this one but
it's also a really nice companion
palette to the other palette in this
collection which is the kaleidoscope
palette because that one I also do have
on my eye is very colorful and bright
and there's not really like transitions
or Crewe shades or things like that and
so if you want to create a look like
that it's nice to be able to come into
this palette I did film this look for
Instagram and I did use of both of the
palettes very pigmented it very easy to
blend I am so happy with this palette
there your tones I think that you would
really enjoy this I have been getting a
lot of use out of it and $26 for the
five shades I mean I was just talking
about dose of colors which was 32 for
the 5 so it's really not too bad but
also I love this packaging on this and
kind of like this frosting on the cover
as well mm I this one is really nice
again I'm just I'm so impressed overall
with this collection I think that Chris
and Lee ended and
amazing job but this is a really nice
eyeshadow palette see I'm not sure where
I got cut off at because my camera died
because I'm having the best day ever but
next up we're gonna talk about the
kaleidoscope palette one is a $39 and
this is a very colorful eyeshadow
palette again you have a mirror and then
also the double-ended brush which again
I think the brush is okay but nothing
super crazy so this is what the inside
of the palette looks like I know a lot
of people are saying that they didn't
love the layout of it and I I get it but
it's not something that bothers me
enough that I wouldn't bust into it and
you can see that this one is super
colorful this one definitely reminds me
a lot of person Liam and here are some
muscle watches if you can see them okay
I have beyond furious with myself that I
really did my clip of my swatches cuz
that takes forever to do and I'm not the
best that's watching anyways but these
are what the swatches from the palette
look like and I mean if you can tell
from the swatches like this palette is
insane I do have it on my eyes today
ones that I haven't used on my eyes are
actually this side right here so I
haven't used these months on my eyes
honestly I don't use that type of green
a ton the black I just don't use a ton
and then these two I just simply haven't
gotten the time to use them yet but the
more colorful shades I felt like that
was what people really gravitate towards
so that's what I wanted to try and they
are really really good very pigmented
like I'm fairly confident this blue is
going to stain my arm for the next three
days it's probably gonna stain my eyes
as well but you can create some really
fun colorful makeup looks with this
palette the shimmers over here are
pretty chunky in inconsistency and you
can kind of get a bit of Fallout on your
face like I've been saying I'm having a
rough day but when I was doing this I
look I actually ended up having blue
basically all over my face I kind of
looked like a smurf at one point and I
was trying to continually come in with a
makeup wipe and wipe it away because you
do get quite a bit of Fallout I
definitely recommend tapping off your
brush really good when you're using
these shades and I also recommend using
a damp brush because I can sometimes
help with a bit of Fallout and it does
also help make the shades you know pop a
little bit more but other than that
everything in here is really nice I
think
these shades
especially are really cool because when
I kind of layered it over the darker
blue that I have on it just kind of
turned into this cool like aqua peacock
type color this islet was definitely
inspired from at that girl Shea XO she
did a tutorial the other night with it
with this palette and did this type of
look and I was like I want to do that
one to all have her video that she did
down below I love her tutorials so much
but I thought she came out with a bum I
look and I really wanted to try it and
this palette is so fun if you are a
colorful makeup lover and like these are
the shades that you love to use and you
and you love to experiment and be bright
and colorful I think you would
absolutely love the kaleidoscope palette
yeah and the shades are so nice in here
this whole collection just really
knocked it out of the park for me and I
would definitely recommend this one as
well so the final items in the
collection that I did receive in PR
there were a couple extras as well but
that did not come in the PR package but
these are the Vice lipsticks I believe
these are $17 i really enjoyed the Urban
Decay vice a lipstick a formula I have
1993 from Urban Decay and I absolutely I
love the shade but I love the formula of
these lipsticks as well my favorite from
the collection and honestly the only one
that I've tried from the collection on
my lips is called a bun bun which is a
comfort mat it is what is on my lips
right now and it is just such a
beautiful it's its mommy but it has a
bit of like of a deeper mauve tone to it
and I just think it's absolutely
gorgeous these are so comfortable
they're nice and creamy they're easy to
glide onto the lips and they stay on for
a good amount of time for a creamy
lipstick but this shade I just think is
absolutely gorgeous
if you have not tried the Urban Decay
vice a lipstick formula yet I really do
recommend it if you like the regular
lipsticks either say try out this
formula because it is really good now
there are also two other colors in here
this one is spellbound and this is a
mega matte and you can see that this is
a very dark purple
I haven't swatched them yet because I'm
not sure if I'm going to give them away
I just don't wear these type of colors a
ton and even though I really like this
formula like I have deeper shades and I
have purple shades as well this one is
cloud9 which is again is a comfort matte
so I haven't done anything with them yet
because I'm just not a hundred percent
and if I'm gonna give them away I
obviously don't want to give away like
swatch makeup or use makeup or things
like that so I'm not 100% yet but
the nude in the collection was the one
that I went for and this is a really
nice formula again if you're a nude
lover like me I think that you would
really enjoy the shade bun-bun I've been
wearing it so much I've already worn it
in a past video as well but even though
I like to switch up lipstick colors a
ton because I have so many lipsticks I
was like I don't care because this is a
fantastic color so the Urban Decay vice
lipstick formula again like I said I
think is really awesome for seventeen
dollars you know not a terrible price
and again the full collection is
available at Sephora and Ulta but those
are the final items in this collection
I recommend everything from it I thought
everything was fantastic huge congrats
to Kristin LeeAnn because she killed it
with this collection with urban decay
and I would recommend to everything in
this collection which that normally does
not happen there's usually something
that's just a Miss for me or whatnot but
this one kudos to her man because this
was really good so I'll have it all
linked down below I'd love to know if
you guys have gotten anything from the
collection yet or have you ordered
anything or tried anything out you have
thoughts on anything I of course would
love to know but after the urban decay
in Chris and Leon collection that's
gonna do it for this review video ok so
that's gonna be everything for my review
video on some new makeup releases I am
sorry that this was probably not my best
video ever but I'm just clearly having
one of those days for everything that
can go wrong will go wrong so that's
what I'm dealing with today but I hope
that you enjoyed these reviews and have
found some of them helpful let me know
