today's video is going to be all about
some new makeup releases I've been so
lucky I've been sent some amazing PR
packages recently and I thought that I
could sit down and talk about some new
makeup releases give my little reviews
on them because I've been trying
everything out do some swatches and just
let you know what I think about some new
makeup that is on the market so if you
would like to see some new makeup
releases and my thoughts on them why
don't we go ahead and get started so I
got sent a lot of lipsticks which it's
just really devastating to me it's like
you know why me I don't like lipstick
huh
how dare these brands send me such
amazing lipstick packages I am just
kidding I've always so grateful for
everything but I'm such a lipstick
junkie a lipstick hoarder that whenever
I get any sort of lip product in the
mail I'm just like overjoyed with that
meanness and so we're gonna start off
with some of the lip products that I
received and I'm gonna start with these
lip colors from milk makeup because
these have been impressing me called
simply their lip colors from milk makeup
and reading off the Sephora website it
says this bold Demi matte lip color
bathes lips in hydration for comfortable
all-day wear a pigment level of 30%
insures one swipe coverage and super
intense color payoff with no base
required it says there's shea butter
coconut oils and grapefruit peel oils
that soften the lips and boosts boy stur
okay that's very cool I'm super into it
so I really enjoy like milk makeups
packaging I always think everything is
like so eye-catching and unique they
sent me even more lip colors I think I
have some in my 30k giveaway and
honestly I I picked out a couple for
myself and then I ended up loving this
formula so much I actually went back and
picked out more for me to keep because I
really really enjoy these actually I
just to just go run into my clutch
because I had one of my favorite shades
in there because I take a traveling with
me because I just love it so this shade
is called cream this is definitely one
of my absolute favorite shades because
it's just that really flattering your
lips but better kind of pinky nude and I
think it's so gorgeous I always have it
in my clutch because I wear it all of
the time there favorite of mine is Loki
which is kind of that cool toned
I was wearing wifey in one of my
previous videos and I got a lot of
compliments on that one this is a really
pretty fall shade it reminds me a little
bit of dead roses from Anastasi beverly
hills one of her new matte lip shades
one is in the shade wavy and I think
this is going to be a really really
pretty fall color kind of that deep deep
Brown this one is in the shade dip out
this last one here it's kind of that
really deep burgundy if you like kind of
vampire looks this one is another one of
my favorites this one is in girl girl
which i think is so fun it's that last a
swatch there
the last shade that I have to swatch is
a red and this one is in OG red and it's
a very like bright poppin red so those
are some of the shades from the milk a
lip colors I actually tried this on for
the first time while doing a YouTube
live I was doing a live PR haul and I
didn't have any lip color on for some
strange reason and I went ahead I think
the shade I went in with was cream at
the very first a swatch that I showed
and I put it on I was like okay cool and
then I kind of like did a double-take in
my viewfinder I was like wait a second
um that looks really good right and so
many people are writing in like wait
that looks so good I love the way that
these are finish on the lips how they
say it's a dummy matte I feel like they
definitely look completely matte on the
lips they just don't really feel that
way when I wear these I don't feel like
I'm wearing a mattifying lipstick but
when you put these on they're actually
creamy which you don't really get with a
matte lipstick I've been trying out an
Anastasia matte lipstick and when you
put it on it kind of skips across the
lips and I find that with a lot of matte
lipsticks they're not creamy they're
kind of hard to apply whereas these are
very creamy I've also had great luck
with how long-lasting these are like I
said I always keep that cream into my
purse I put this on I wore cream - when
I was tailgating a football game a
couple of weekends ago I put cream on at
like 6:00 a.m. because we had to get up
at an insanely early time and I touched
up two times throughout the whole day
from 6:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. or
whatever it was when I finally took my
makeup off I only had to do
two touch-ups which i think is pretty
frigging phenomenal they're super easy
to build up so I think the long wear
them are also really good I just love
the finish that I guess to the lips I
think it is so pretty they do have a ton
of colors these are the ones that I
decided to keep from my selves but I
kept more than I normally would because
I like this formula so much I really
wanted to keep a variety of different
colors because depending on what makeup
look I'm doing if there's a certain
color that I want
I like this formula so much I want it to
be able to have that color range in this
lipstick because I'm so so impressed
with this formula these are $22 you can
also find them at Sephora I know that's
on the high side for a lipstick for sure
but i'm here saying that I love this
formula and I think these are really
good lipsticks I would normally not
really keep this many lipsticks and in
all of these different shades like some
of these darker shades the vampyre
shades that Reds the Burgundy's I don't
normally keep that many for when I get
PR I kind of just pick my favorites but
like I said I just wanted to be able to
have as many of these because I enjoyed
this formula so much so I do definitely
highly recommend the milk lip colors
next up I got some lip colors here from
NARS which I was really excited for
because I've never tried they're
audacious lipsticks and they came out
with a few new shades some of them are
new to the audacious lipstick line some
of them are a limited edition shade so I
have five colors here I believe they
sent me six and I can't find the other
one so I might have already put that
into a giveaway pile so I apologize
about that but I do have five of the
shades here to kind of chat about so
this is one that I have worn this is
called verb' key the B key there's no I
don't know where the are came from this
is just like my classic nude that I love
so much it has a little bit of almost
kind of like a peachy vibe to it
that one is of a biggie and I thought it
was really pretty this next one that I
tried is in Dale I was wearing this in
my last week's will i buy it video it
was a really pretty again that kind of
like cool toned mouth but like really
cool toned which I thought was all about
neck shade that I have tried is in Linda
and this is kind of a deeper nude it has
some a brown
undertones to it here is a really dark
one I'm not going to swatch it because I
am gonna put this into a giveaway pile
but that one is in the shade ayah and it
looks to be like that really like vampy
type of like burgundy shade maybe with
some hints of purple in there the other
one that I won't be swatching is
inaccurate que IRAP but this looks like
a very very deep purple so those two
will also be going into my giveaway pile
but then these are the three that I
decided to keep for myself and the
swatches of those the lip colors are $32
which is which is definitely very very
pricey a for a lipstick the packaging is
something that I noticed right away it
like the packaging is so intense so I
mean it might just seem like it's
regular black packaging but you can tell
holding it like it's actually heavy like
the actual lipstick is very heavy it's
very legit and then how it kind of
collapsed on it it's I don't want to say
it's magnetic no notice it is magnetic
it is magnetic packaging but actual
lipstick like I said this was the first
time that I was trying an audacious
lipstick and what I realized what these
are that they are very intense picking
out wise I mean you really need that one
swipe and it's like BAM it's it's very
pigmented they are very creamy and to be
honest it's almost a little bit on the
overwhelming side I use the shade Linda
the other day which is this darker nude
right here and I felt like I had I felt
like it was too much like because you
know as I'm applying a lipstick I'm
thinking of it as applying a regular
lipstick I'm kind of going back and
forth back and forth I felt almost like
it was too too much is too overwhelming
and I actually came in with a tissue and
kind of did that block thing to try to
tone it down a little bit I've never
really feel like I've had that
experience with a lipstick where it was
like it was just almost a little bit too
much you need a very light hand with
these need to go in like almost kind of
gently because the color is so intense
the pigmentation is so intense and it's
it takes you very little product to get
there so I know they are expensive
at $32 I think they would last you a
really long time based on I have tried
all three of these shades now on my lips
and just based on how much product you
actually need to get such an intense lip
color it was actually pretty wild to me
so like I said this is my first time
trying the audacious lipsticks from NARS
and I feel like you just have to go in a
little bit carefully but you're gonna
get a pretty bum lip color out of this I
was really really pleasantly surprised
with how insanely pigmented these were
so those are the NARS audacious
lipsticks they added a few new colors to
the collection so I'll have those linked
down below of course so next up a new
lipstick collection I got I got this
package in the mail this is from mac
cosmetics their collaboration with Nicki
Minaj's so she designed these two
lipsticks right here those are her
designs and then they also sent this guy
are right here a full of different nude
lipsticks and then also does have two
lip glasses here on each end also man
this was oh oh
I mean it's someone to just get a
package full of nude lipsticks it's just
like my dream come true
okay I was so excited when I got this I
was so overwhelmed I was not expecting
this in the slightest I have gotten a
few PR packages from Mac but I never
expected they would send me the nicki
minaj collab that was so unbelievably
crazy so I have done a lip swatches with
some of these I swatch I think it was
six of different shades including both
of the lipsticks that Nicki herself did
I did a lip swatch on Instagram so I'll
have that link down below in case you
would like to see it but the lipsticks
that she came out with are this one is
called the pink print yeah the pink
print so this is what that first one
looks like and then here is the swatch
of that it is a very very light pink
very very light I'm very creamy it's in
the amplified cream is the finish on
that one and then the other one she came
out with is and Nicki's nude so there's
what that one looks like and there they
are swatched together some Nicky's nude
is just a little bit darker but really
like not not too much that one is
amplified cream lipstick as well so they
are like really creamy and they have a
shine to them now unfortunately both of
these lipsticks did not look great on me
if you have maybe my skin tone I'm not
sure these would look the best on you
because they really just didn't do much
for me I actually wore Nicky's nude in
an Instagram tutorial I was trying it
for the first time and I finished it off
with this and before I sat down to film
I actually ended up wiping it off and
going with a different lipstick because
I just didn't feel like either one
looked great on me personally I mean I'm
sure several people are gonna be able to
pull it off a lot better than me but on
me personally I just didn't love them
and then like I said I do have a swatch
video with some of the lipsticks on here
but I'll go through and swatch a few of
them so again I had to run to my clutch
to pull out my favorite one from the
collection it's called
age sex the location which like of
course my favorite lipstick from the
collection is something with a name like
age sex location like really Samantha
but it's just such a gorgeous Newt it's
not too Brown it's not too pink it's not
too big it's just like my perfect nude
and I love it and then I am going to be
going through this and you know giving
some away because obviously I can't keep
this many lipsticks so I don't want to
swatch everything because I will be
giving some away this one is in stripped
is a really really light kind of beige a
nude these lipsticks are all seventeen
fifty I believe the only place that you
can get them is going to be at Mac and
Mac online but I will have that linked
down below this one is in derriere and
this one is a darker nude if you like
more of that deep brown nude this one is
called easy babe right here is easy babe
I really enjoyed that one as well that
was another favorite of mine this one is
called among the fireflies it's that one
that one has a little bit of the hint of
mauve and kind of funny when I was going
through swatching them I picked out this
one which is called a girl's got needs I
put it on and I was in me like oh no
it's just like more creamer please from
the dose of colors and Katy and desi
collection it's this one over here and
that shade really did not look good on
me at all and this one reminded me so
much of it so unfortunately that would
work out for me so a girl's got needs if
you wanted to get more creamer please
you weren't able to get it if you like
MAC lipsticks maybe check out this shade
because I thought they were extremely
extremely a similar to one another and
then just wash the lip glasses the first
one is called under the sheet that one
is under the sheets it's really
beautiful I actually do like the Mac lip
glasses or their lip glosses and I
didn't really expect to because I'm not
a huge gloss person and this one is
called nu de or nude it's got the dashes
the dashes in between each of the
letters so this one up here is in nude
and this is definitely more nude than
this one which has a bit more sparkle to
it and it's kind of a little bit more
like on the pearlized side I would say
where are some of the swatches from the
Mac Nicki Minaj collection if you've
never tried matte lipsticks they have a
variety of different finishes to them my
personal favorites are the mattes that I
just you know I enjoy matte lipsticks
that's typically what I tend to
gravitate towards I know people say that
they can be drying
matte lipsticks in general the only
lipsticks from Mac that I find to be on
the drawing site are the matte lipsticks
which is not surprising and it is
something that doesn't bother me because
again that's what I tend to gravitate
towards too so I can I can get over that
part the mats are definitely my
favorites a creme Sheen's are probably
the formula that I like the least
because they just they're kind of just
like that shiny lipstick and I guess I
don't know they're not glossy it's like
they're shiny and I just don't really
tend to gravitate towards that a whole
lot and then the lip glasses like I said
I do like these I own quite a few and I
think they are a good lip gloss there to
choose to either nice and glossy a lot
of them are pretty pigmented like color
wise they're pretty pigmented like you
could even wear them on their own for a
lightly colored lip gloss do you like
the olap glasses as well so big thank
you to Mac for sending me this
collection this that was pretty cool so
next up I got a new a brow product and
this is from a benefit
medics this is their foolproof brow
powder so this is what the packaging
looks like and then when you open it up
you have what looks like a little
eyebrow shape in there and then the
applicator the applicator is pretty
interesting it kind of reminds me almost
of like the old school like eyeshadow
sponges except it has a really pointed
tip and then if you pull out the other
side it does have a spoolie I'm looking
at the alte website this is a $24 it
says instantly fill your brows and
create a soft natural brow look it says
it's velvety smooth 12-hour formula
instantly adheres to hair and skin that
transforming sparse brows into full
looking brows has the lighter to darker
shade duo's mimic the gradual look of
natural brows so what that means is if
you can see my images in the shade 3 and
has the lighter shade towards the top of
the brow or beginning of the brow and
then the darker shade towards the tail
of the brows I honestly thought I was
going to really like it because if you
watched my was at yesterday's video
testing new makeup there was a brow
pencil in there from Estee Lauder
company brought a multitasker and it's a
pencil on one side but then it also has
a brow powder and I really thought the
powder was like putting my brows over
the edge so I really thought that I was
going to love this and I don't I don't
love it
but I think it's alright I still think
that I need to kind of mess around with
how to apply it I don't mind the
applicator but I don't feel like I can
do a full brow with this applicator I
feel like I haven't quite got a good
handle on this yet what I do like this
for is actually the tail though because
you can create like a really sharp tail
does because it's so pointed and I would
feel like because it's so pointed that
you'd be able to get those nice like
strokes in the front but not really the
powder is also very waxy I didn't
realize it was going to be quite as waxy
as it was and it's kind of one of those
like once you put it on you really don't
have a lot of time to work with it you
really got to make sure that you're
getting it on correctly the first time
because with the wax it just kind of
like boom it's there like it's I mean
when it says it adheres to your hairs on
your skin I do agree with that but it
means it doesn't click
so you really got work quickly to make
sure you get it all in there like
overall it's okay if you like brow
powders or brow waxes you know you can
maybe give this a shot and see what you
think of it I don't think it's my
favorite yet if there's someone who
prefers brow pencils like me I don't
think this will be your favorite either
it was a little bit hard to get the hang
of it gets interesting that you're
getting like the two different shades
essentially in one I don't totally hated
the applicator it's just taking a little
bit to get the hang up the packaging
that is a little bit on the bulky side
you know cuz I'm used to you know my
pencils and things like that that I can
kind of neatly stack in there whereas
this one is kind of just sitting on my
desk because I can't figure out how to
store it yeah I also didn't want to say
I'm gonna be having a giveaway on my
snapchat for two of these I have the
shades of one and five that were also
sent to me from benefit and those are
not my shades so I'm gonna be giving
them away on my snapchat after this
video goes alive so if you're not
following me yet on snapchat
I'm a samantha dot march over there I
also have that listed down below come by
and follow me if you are interested in
winning a full-proof abreu out for
yourself and testing out of this new
product but it's so far the benefit
foolproof it's not a complete fail for
me but we're just kind of like in the
middle right now or just we're just in
the middle just a little tough to get
the hang of and the final item that I
have here is the new appear eyeshadow
palette this is the appear Pro palette
the Pierre Etienne palette for Etienne
Ortega I believe is how you say his name
he is a celebrity makeup artist so he
collaborated with Pierre to create this
eyeshadow palette the palette does have
a mirror and then these are all of the
different shades in here I have been
trying this out like crazy and so far I
have really been enjoying it I really
like pure I like pierrez eyeshadows but
some of them can be a bit of a Miss for
me I did not like the My Little Pony
palette that Peter just recently came
out with and then they came out this one
and I started trying it right away and I
was like yes I think that these blend so
well if you like the warm toned palettes
you know this is what you're getting
here but there's also some really fun
colors in here like midnight is a really
beautiful kind of like a deep navy with
some shimmer to it
billionaire paradise those are fun
colors wheeler and Adobe are definitely
my favorite shades from the palette
popular and adobe are basically the two
that I go into every single time but
here are two more swatches this one is
in bossy and then this one is in
midnight one is penny which is gorgeous
all over the eyes and this next one is
legend and then the last one down here
is dreamer there are a few more swatches
of some of the deeper colors so this one
up here is money or mony and then we
have faux and then also xenon and then
this last one right here is billionaire
which is such a cool shade I've paired
these two together like this one mostly
all over the lid and in the crease and
then xenon and the inner corner and I
thought it looked really cool I have
used almost every single one of these
shades and not quite all of them I've
been really impressed with this palette
which had me very excited because I was
a little bit leery after the My Little
Pony but I felt like everything has been
working out really well for me they
blend so easily and that's what's really
important to me in a palette because I'm
not a makeup artist I'm not always the
best at doing makeup I don't have the
most patients to blend a shadows all the
time so when I was able to see how
easily these were to blend for me that
makes this palette a big big plus in my
book I also like the color scheme in
here like I like that we have some of
these different fun colors like the Moni
over here at the midnight even a shade
like billionaire and then we still have
you know your lighter shades and you
know the shades that I tend to frequent
towards when I you know kind of getting
into my go-to makeup looks but some of
these goals are absolutely gorgeous
xenon is such a fun color I like that we
have stripped here because every time I
go into those palette this is basically
the first shade that I'm using to put
down all over my lid so I appreciate
that and then you know we have your
darker shades too if you want to do
something more smokier but I've been
really impressed with the palette I love
the big mirror on here just $42 you can
find it on the pur website and is also
available at Ulta of you don't need
another warm toned palette then you know
you probably don't need this one but if
you love finding new eyeshadow palettes
are the shades in here are calling to
you I would recommend this one to you I
feel like I've been having a really good
time with it and it was one of these
palettes that the other day I was
sitting down getting ready to do my
makeup and I'm thinking what I show a
palette to do I want to play with and I
was like I want to play with this one
some more it to me shows me
I actually really do enjoy makeup when I
want to reach for oh and I'm just
sitting here and I have nothing in mind
I wasn't doing an Instagram tutorial it
was just whatever you want to do with
your makeup today girl like you pick an
eyeshadow palette and this is the one
that I wanted to pick so I've been
having a really good time at with the
