today's video is going to be all about
eyeshadow pellet reviews I have some new
palettes here that I want to share my
thoughts on so I'm going to be reviewing
the mini sunset palette from Natasha de
Nonna also the Urban Decay backtalk
palette and then I will also be
reviewing the Anastacio soft glam
palette I really want to do more review
videos on my channel it's something that
I'm going to be striving for let me know
if you like the style video of course a
favorite youtuber of mine Andrea she
does these videos really consistently
and I really enjoy when she does her new
palette releases and reviews and there's
some of my favorite videos to watch so
she's definitely inspired me to make
this a really consistent video on my
channel I will have her channel of
course linked down below but it's
something that I definitely want to do
more so I'm excited to be viewing these
three palettes today so if you want to
see my thoughts on these palettes why
don't we go ahead and get started but
first up I want to talk about the mini
sunset palette from Natasha de Nonna my
friend Candice did send this to me which
I was really excited about I was
planning on purchasing this I kind of
went back and forth on it for a while
and then I finally was like you know
what girl go ahead and do it it's $24 so
it's less expensive but then some of her
other palettes of course but it also is
a mini palette I mean it says it in the
title is the mini sunset palette so I
knew obviously it was going to be
smaller and you were going to be getting
less product but for me that was going
to be okay
I was planning on picking it up during
the vib sale which is coming up but
Candace actually got it she said that
she didn't love it so she sent it on to
me which I was really excited about so
when I got it I mean it definitely is a
small palette I'll do close-up shots and
the swatches and things like that but I
mean it definitely is a small pellet you
know I grabbed out my dose of colors
marvelous mom's palette so you can see
maybe you can see kind of the difference
you know in size I mean it definitely is
a smaller palette you do get less
product I think overall the total amount
of grams is 0.8 grams for comparison
sakes because I did pull it out this is
1.7 grams of total product is $32 for
the five shades and again this one is at
$24 you also do get a mirror with the
dose of colors Marvell smiles and all of
that but this isn't really a
in video but I just thought sizable
highs I would show that so I will say
though the size doesn't bother me I know
the size was really bothering a lot of
people the amount of product is really
bothering a lot of people for me that's
not something that upsets me I like my
small palates
I like the dose of colors you know five
shade palettes I have a bunch of color
pop palettes like the I love Sarah
palettes that have four shades in there
and I know a lot of people are like you
can take the singles out and put them in
a big Z palette I don't want to do that
I'm someone who actually likes these
smaller palette they are what I reach
for more so the size of this doesn't
bother with bother me at all it would be
super easy to travel with I don't mind
that it's smaller I also don't mind that
you get less product because I have said
this a lot in my past videos I do not
mind minis I don't mind paying less for
something and getting less product
because I very rarely go through items
especially when it comes to eyeshadow
palettes I very rarely areas the snoring
if you hear that I very rarely hit pan
on anything I am very light handed when
it comes to my makeup which definitely
plays a part of it but I have someone
who does having a larger eyeshadow
collection that it's it's so hard for me
to hit pan on anything again going back
to this marvelous mom's palette this
might be one of my most used I shadow
palettes I travel with this a ton I wore
it almost every single day on my sixth
day Arizona vacation
there is no pan at all I mean you can
see little dips and dents in the shades
but there's no pan and I wear this
eyeshadow palette a time so if you're
someone like me who you are light handed
maybe you have a larger eyeshadow
collection or maybe you're someone who
doesn't wear eyeshadow on a daily basis
type of thing this could be a good
option for you especially to try out the
Natasha Genoa eyeshadows but if you're
someone who is heavier handed you know
you have those like 2-3 pallets in your
collection that you continually use and
you go through products and you hit pan
on them sure this might not be the best
option for you but for me personally
that is why I was excited and that's why
I decided to purchase it but again a
huge thank you to keep this for sending
this to me because
I was very excited about it the shades
in here had me pretty stoked because
there are the shades that I just I
really enjoy and again I don't mind only
having a five shades because I'm someone
who is not necessarily artistically
creative and sometimes it's hard for me
especially when I look at a big eye
shadow palette with a ton of different
shades it's hard for me to think of like
okay what am I gonna do a lot of times I
watch YouTube tutorials today to get
this eye look I went off an Instagram
tutorial like I don't have the best of
mind when it comes to that so again
sometimes that's why I geared towards
these smaller palettes versus dose of
colors palettes because I feel like I
can look at it and be like yes I know
what I'm doing today and it gets me it
gets me pretty excited so I like that we
have the two math you have to matte
brown shades which I enjoy that we have
those and I really do like the shimmer
colors in here I love that they put in
this cranberry color I was wearing it
recently and I really enjoyed it and
then I also really enjoyed these two
gold shades and I think the quality of
these eyeshadows are really really good
this has me very impressed with
nataschab de Nonna shadows I will say
that so again if you've been wanting to
try out her palettes but you refused to
spend the $100 and up because that is
definitely me this could be a really
good way to dip your toes into the brand
see if you like it and then also at the
same time maybe you'll realize hey these
are some of my favorite shades will
actually need to go out and buy that big
ol I should have palette with all these
other shades in there that maybe I don't
use this is good enough for me and
you're only going to spend the $24 on it
so this palette actually has me very
excited all of the shades I have used
all five of the shades and I think that
they are really beautiful I do want to
have an Instagram tutorial up for each
of the palettes that I'm talking about I
do have a back top already up I will
have soft glam going up soon the only
one that I haven't filmed a tutorial
with yet is this one right here because
I was mostly doing day to night looks
when I use this palette and I don't
typically film those for Instagram but I
will be doing an Instagram tutorial with
this one as well so if you don't follow
me on Instagram yet I do post a tutorial
fairly often over there so I will be
doing that with this one but I have to
say I'm very impressed with it the mats
were easy to use pigmented blendable
that shimmers are so so good
these are shimmers that I don't have to
use a damp brush with typically with
every single shimmer I will always want
to spray
I brush with some sort of like setting
spray just taking it damp so the
shimmers pop a little bit more there a
little bit more metallic and you
actually don't need that with these I
always try them first when I'm using a
new palette I will try it first without
the setting spray just to get an idea of
the quality and because I know not
everybody wants to use a damp brush you
don't have a setting spray and that sort
of thing these are ones that you don't
need
I still then go in and spray my brush
just because I like it with a little bit
more pop but there's a lot of eyeshadow
palettes but you have to have that
option otherwise the shadows just look
like blah on your eyes so that impressed
me with this one as well so I think
personally for me for the 24 dollars but
I prefer in my collection this one would
not it like if I were to have purchased
this one myself instead of getting it as
a gift I would still be happy with this
I would still have kept it and I still
would have been happy with my purchase
it's also one of those things that now
that I do have this one and I have the
shades in here that I really do like I'm
kind of that person I was like huh
maybe I don't need that big ol sunset
palette I'm late cuz I'm happy with this
guy I can travel with it I know what I
looks I want to create when it comes to
this and I feel like the quality is
really good so this one this one got a
thumbs up for me so next up I want to
talk about the urban decay a back talk
at palette just so if you caught my will
I buy it where I've talked about this
palette I was so excited for this
release I really enjoy urban decay as a
brand I have a lot from them ivory
purchased a lot from them and I used
them on a very consistent basis I travel
with their products a lot they're truly
just one of my favorite brands I was
very excited when I saw this palette
because on the eyeshadow side these are
just like my tones right now I'm really
into the pinks and these mobs I was very
excited about that but I thought it was
really cool to see that we were also
getting a double palette essentially we
were also getting a face aside for this
palette where you have blushes and
highlights too there is a magnetic
mirror that can pull out with the
packaging but I was just excited I
really like all-inclusive palettes I
like a lot of face palettes I like being
able to go into one palette and getting
up more options than just a blush
palette just a highlight palette I like
having a palette that has more than one
option in there so when I saw this I was
like this is like my perfect palette
palette is $46 you should be able to
find out on the Urban Decay website
still and it is available on Sephora so
of course everything I'm talking about
will be linked down
so this palette has been getting lots of
lots of mixed to feedback I would say so
I'm just gonna offer my two cents in
here and then let you guys know what I
think about it for myself so first of
all I don't mind the packaging on this
it is a little bit on the bulky side but
a lot of times when I am doing my makeup
I will just pull the mirror out
sometimes I use the mirror but I have my
own little like handheld mirror that I
use when I do my makeup but I will say
that I did travel with this palette over
Easter weekend and I did just pull out
the mirror and that's what I used to do
my eye makeup so I appreciate it the
fact that we have that I also do like
that you can pull it out so if you don't
want the mirror or if you think that's
part is annoying or too bulky or
whatever it's not a it's not something
that is in there permanently and you
can't do anything about it so I do
appreciate that so I will also say for
the eyeshadows side of things that's
where I will start with again I love
this color scheme because it is very me
especially right now these are the tones
that I'm reaching for these are the
shadows that I'm reaching for I did do a
first impression with this palette and
at the time that I did the first
impression video there was already some
reviews coming out saying that there was
no pigmentation to these you know the
palette was a bust and I was really
disappointed I will say to that urban
decay did send this to me in PR but I
was I was fully planning on purchasing
it myself
I was going to buy it after we got home
from our Arizona trip just because I
knew a I didn't wanted to come while we
were gone but also I knew even if I
ordered it right away I wasn't going to
be able to play with it type of things I
knew I my review was going to come later
than others o what I'll say is that when
I did my first impression video I liked
the look that I came up with and I
didn't feel like I had like a lot of
struggles with it it was a pretty basic
look I'll you know link my video down
below of course but a lot of times when
I'm trying out a new palette I go for
pretty basic right away you know boy
with my comfort zone my technique that I
have with eyeshadows however like the
look that I came up with also what I did
say in that video was that I wish there
was at least like one more matte shade
in here we have three sheets which is
matte back tuck which is matte and then
WTF which is matte so this three shape
three sheets basically the only thing
that I use it for is to kind of set my
eye primer or the concealer on my eyes
as kind of a base shadow and then we
have a really nice mob and then a pretty
warm brown over here in WTF the rest are
shimmers
so I wish there was one more maybe like
another pinky shade or something that
just one more matte in here I think
would be really helpful also bear and
curve I feel like these guys are really
similar but I like curve more it just
has a little bit more pigmentation to it
bear just doesn't do a whole lot for me
the only step I would use that as for
like an inner corner or brow bone
highlight but it's just a little bit
lacking so I wish there wish these two
weren't in there because they are so
similar and when you have a smaller
palette like this I just wish there was
more versatility with it but moving kind
of down the line I love to back talk
back talking WTF I think are fabulous I
love them shade and attitude
I actually really like these as well and
a lot of people are saying that they
don't like the shade shade and I do and
that is what I used in my first
impression video and I was really happy
with it I loved putting it all over the
lid I think it's just like really cool
pop of color and I like that shade a lot
again attitude I've used as well all
over the lid I really like that one and
180 is really cool I'm glad that we have
180 in there because it's a different
it's it's more of the brown tones and
again I think this is actually the one
that I used in my Instagram tutorial so
again that will be linked down below
I like that shade as well and I think it
brings something a little bit more
different and unique it to the palette
instead of being I mean it's a pretty
monochromatic palette don't get me wrong
but I like that we have that that shade
in there I just I feel like it's just
missing just a few key components that
could make this a really really good
eyeshadow palette and have more
versatility with it but again if I'm
talking about me personally and what I'm
reaching for I like this palette for
these shades and I like all of the looks
that I've come up with in this palette I
won't say it completely knocked it out
of a park with me eyeshadow wise that
I'm absolutely completely braving about
this palette but again if I purchase
this at the $46 I still would keep this
palette I would not return it I still do
like it I like the shades in here you
know it makes me worried especially when
I do get something impure because I feel
like people won't take my opinion as
seriously but if you guys watch my
videos I talk about PR products that I
get that I don't like my last makeup
monthly every single one of my fails was
items that I received in PR I don't care
if I receive something or if I buy it
myself or if a friend gives it to me I
have to be honest and I still have to
say that I do like this palette and I
would keep it myself now I don't think
it's for everybody though and again I
don't think it's a 5-star palette I
think there are a few tweaks that could
have happened with it but I mean
pigmentation wise I guess I I don't know
because I feel like everything works
really well for me again I do use a damp
brush so I do you know wet my brush with
a setting spray when I use the shimmers
in here and I won't say there are like
the Natasha de Nona where a I don't need
to spread my brush but B when I do I
really only need like one to two passes
to build up a shade you do have to build
these up a little bit more over me for
the eyeshadows I do like this palette
again I took this traveling with me over
Easter weekend I was the only palette
that I brought with me I didn't bring
any other eyeshadows with me and this is
what I worked off of because I do like
it if you're someone like me who you're
really into these tones and these are
your vibes I think that you would like
this palette as well if these are not
your shades if you don't like
monochromatic palettes don't buy this
one because I don't know why you would
cuz you won't like it but again for me I
enjoy this palette so that's what I
think about the eyeshadow side again I
don't want to say it's like for how
excited I was over the backtalk palette
it didn't get me to that level of height
but I still liked the palette and I
still would recommend it if it seems
like a palette for you and I understand
that it's not going to be for everyone
then on the face side so I will say that
a lot of the reviews I'm seeing are
people saying they don't really like the
eyeshadow side but they like the face
palette side I am I don't know me I'm
not sure I don't know because I do like
the eyeshadow side I like the face side
but it doesn't get me like quite as
excited so I'm not sure I feel like I I
mean again this is just my two cents and
what I have to say I can't go off what
everybody else says in their reviews I
have to go off what I think and what I
reach for I will still say that I like
the face side as well and I'm glad that
we have it I think it's cool again when
I took this traveling I didn't bring any
other highlights or blushes with me I'd
literally just put this palette in my
bag and that's again what I worked out
for the weekend I do like the blushes in
here I will
say that they're kind of hard though
because if I go in more heavier hand it
it's too much it's too pigmented the
first time or the second time I used it
when I used this shape right here I
think it was it was almost like clown
and Shawn me it was too much so then
when I go in with a lighter hand it's
like it's too little and I have to take
my time blending it out but I don't mind
the blushes at all and I think that they
are really pretty I do like the
highlights I actually have party foul on
today because I do prefer the highlight
out of here but I like the face side as
well so I think everything is nicely
pigmented over here the blushes were
just a little bit hard to work with but
I actually really liked both of the
colors in here and they're different
from what I have in my blush collection
I have a lot of like light pink baby
doll pink a lot of like neutral pinks in
my blush collection so I thought that
these were cool colors for me to have
again I prefer party foul for the
highlight this highlight I don't wear as
much because it has a little bit more
like color to white which I don't always
love for my highlights but again I still
think that these are nice highlights so
overall I still like the palette I think
it works well for me for my personal
makeup vibes and for what I go for
and again I'm someone when it does come
to my makeup looks I'm I'm more on the
simple side usually again let's why the
natasha de nono works for me so well
because I can look at it and I know what
I'm getting and I feel like that's very
similar to the Urban Decay backtalk so
again this might be something where if
you are like me and you have trouble
coming up with your own makeup looks and
you need something that's a little bit
more simpler and maybe more
monochromatic I still think that you
would like this palette I will say that
Urban Decay's items seem to go on sale a
lot so if this is one that you're
thinking about but you're not sure
because of all the mixed reviews or
you're not sure how much use you would
get out of all of these shades wait a
little bit because I have a feeling it
would probably go on sale or at least
the vib sale is coming up so you can get
the 15% off I think it is if you really
do want to try this palette but for me I
still like it I can't say that I'm
overly hyped about it that it's a
five-star product for me how excited I
was for the palette that's what got me a
little bit let down but I feel like the
palette overall isn't a letdown I just
wish there was a few little differences
to it a few little tweaks to it but
overall I'm happy with this palette so
that's what I
so the last I shadow path that I want to
chat about for this video is from
Anasazi Beverly Hills and this is the
new esophagram palette my friend at
Katie Orr Katie Murray from my vanity
actually sent this to me for my birthday
so big thank you to Katie I will leave
her channel link down below a huge thank
you to her I really wanted this palette
but I mentioned in my latest empties
video I've been trying really hard not
to be on like a low by for makeup we
just you know my husband lost his job
back in January he is now working again
which is great but what he's doing now
we actually have to move so we'll have
you know some life changes coming up and
honestly it just kind of going through
that situation really made me step back
from a lot of things and that included
buying makeup and I feel like I'm just
still in that mindset right now even
though we're in a better place and
everything I still feel like I'm in that
mindset of like I don't know what
tomorrow is gonna bring type of thing
now I wanted this palette I I really do
like Anastacio Beverly Hills I shadow
palettes and modern Renaissance is
definitely one of my favorite palettes I
did like the subculture I actually ended
up decluttering it because the dupe for
it I thought was really good and I
actually liked the dupe more so I
actually declared the subculture but I
saw a lot of reviews coming in and
people who are saying this is more
similar to the modern Renaissance
formula and that's what had me excited
so this is $42 you can find it on the
anasazi website and also Sephora and
Ulta it's the same kind of packaging for
the modern Renaissance this kind of
velvety feel right here and then inside
again is very similar to my Renaissance
and subculture you have a mirror you do
get a brush as well I just typically
don't use the brushes and then you have
the eyeshadows if you can tell I've
really been I've really been loving on
this palette it's I built this what if
this is a dirty palette for me again I'm
pretty light hand it and I don't make
like a big mess but I feel like this one
you can see that I've been trying to
give it some love as I'm getting ready
for this review I did use it on my eyes
today I have another Instagram tutorial
that will be going up and out on this
look but I have an Instagram tutorial
going up as well so what I will say
afford this palette is that I love it
does it my review thanks for watching it
I'm just kidding but the moment that I
dipped into this palette I was like yes
yes
ma'am because this is it is similar to
the modern Renaissance formula and I
appreciate that so much now there are
repeat shades in here from the modern
renaissance I'm tempera is in the modern
renaissance and then Cyprus number and I
think Bert orange are in the modern
Renaissance
appellate so if you have the modern
Renaissance and like those are your
favorite shades and the other shades
don't really interest you definitely
don't get this palette because there are
repeat shades I don't necessarily mind
the repeat shades in here especially
with those particular shades because I
reach for those a lot so instead of it's
just one of those like really weird
small things but when I'm creating an
eye look I like to go in to one palette
and create a full eye look or the
majority of an eye look so I wouldn't
want to be reaching for my modern
Renaissance of for those shades and then
coming into this one it would just bug
me so for that reason I do appreciate
that we have those shades because like a
tempura I use basically every single
time it does have a bit of a sheen to it
but I do like to place it all over the
lid and then I also like it for inner
corner for Bravo and highlight and all
of that burnt orange as a shade that I
could use every single day and be happy
with Cyprus number is a nice shade for
if you want to deepen up and I look it's
not something that I do absolutely have
to have but I do want to say that about
the repeat shades that's just gonna be
you know your personal preference a type
of thing but when the when the palette
came out when we saw it was going to be
in the palette I was like this this is a
palette for me these are shades that I
love these are shades that I reach for
you know it's a lot of there's there is
a lot of neutral in here but I loved the
pops of color that we're in here like
this a sultry shade I don't know if you
can tell but I clearly have loved on
that shade because it's it's a hot mess
it already has quite a big dent into it
I do like that we get a black in this
palette and I actually did use the black
for today's eye look I liked these
golden here and that soft pink this
dusty rose is one of my favorite colors
almost every single time I've gone into
this palette I have somehow found a way
to put dusty rose on my eyes because
that really like muted purple mauve is
just I'm like feeling it right now
so I was really excited over the quality
of this eyeshadow palette I love the way
they blend I love
pigment they are the shimmers are
beautiful again I do use I do use a damp
brush with the shimmers because I will
say do get some fallout with these same
as I do the modern renaissance but
nothing too crazy I would just recommend
when you use this palette do your eyes
first and then move on to the rest of
your face so you can wipe everything
away so I do want to mention the fallout
but other than that this is just this I
really really like this palette thank
you so much Katie for sending this to me
again this is another one that if I
wouldn't have received it as a gift and
I would have spent the $42 on it it
would have been happy with it I wouldn't
have returned it and I really like this
palette and again I feel like you can do
a lot of different looks with this one
you can do a non matte look you can
bring in the shimmers you can go dark
you can do neutral you can do a really
simple I like as well and then you can
do something really dark and dramatic
with some of these deeper shades in here
sultry was one that actually kind of
surprised me with how deep of a shimmer
it is for some reason looking at it I
thought it would be more I don't know
more just like of a pinky shimmer but it
has a lot of depth to it but I also like
that we have glistening which is a
really pretty gold the only thing that I
will say is like between bronze
glistening and fairy I mean they're all
different and I'll be inserting swatches
- they're different but it's still like
maybe there could have been just
something a little bit different yeah
you know what I mean like maybe just a
little bit different of another gold in
there because like rose pink and sultry
those are very different and even like
these mats here in this corner they're
all different enough so that would be
like my only thing like if I had to
change something about the palette I
would maybe have tweaked one of those to
a different color shimmer if you were on
the fence about it I would recommend it
you know look through your collection to
see if you do need it you know I don't
try to be that person that's like you
need absolutely everything but if you've
been thinking about this one and maybe
if you wanted the sister palette to the
mine-run sun sand subculture didn't do
it for you or if you never caved and got
the modern renaissance but you were
interested in the soft glam it is
something that I would recommend this
one has me is so very excited if I had
to rank the three eyeshadow palettes
that I was talking about in this video I
would do a soft Glen would be one
natasha Winona would be two in urban
decay would be three if that helps at
all or gives you any sort of
better inclination of what I think of
the three eyeshadow pellets that I'm
reviewing that is the order that I would
rank them and I just really enjoyed the
soft glam palette so after that that is
going to do it for today's video okay so
that's gonna be everything for today's
video I really hope you enjoyed this
video or you found it helpful in some
way let me know what you thought about
the three palettes that I chatted about
down below do you have any of these yet
are you buying them are you gonna wait
for the sale I really do hope that you
found this helpful I like I said I
wanted to do more review videos on my
channel so I'll try to do these on a
pretty consistent basis please let me
know if there's Adam's out there that
you want to see reviewed but I already
have like four more review videos and
the works I actually was thinking about
reviewing more products in here but I
know I can be a little bit chatty and
long-winded so I don't want to make
these too long so I decided to limit it
to the three but I hope that you found
it helpful I'm again you know never just
base what you're gonna buy on one
person's review you know watch a lot of
different reviews and actually listen to
what they're saying and how that
pertains to your makeup style your
makeup vibe but what's in your makeup
collection and all of that because it
varies just so much from person to
person um so that's it for today's video
guys I hope that you found it helpful if
you did I hope that you'll give this
video a thumbs up I hope that you'll
also consider subscribing before you go
and I'll catch you guys in tomorrow's
