today's video is long overdue but I
finally wanted to sit down and talk all
about the new Sephora give me some nude
lip collection I have had these sitting
in my office for at least two weeks if
not more I bought that the day that it
released and that I just have not had
time yet to sit down and film this video
but is what I am finally doing today so
if you haven't seen any of my past
videos I typically buy every give me
some nude lip set that Sephora comes out
with because I'm a lipstick addict and
also a nude lipstick addict so these are
like these are like everything to me so
these are $28 they typically all come in
this type of packaging and then you get
a variety of different lips table in
this particular one we have six
different lip tonics and they're all a
deluxe sized sample except for one we
get a full-size sometimes there's one
full size product sometimes there's two
it just depends but like I said I buy
these I think they come on maybe like
twice a year and I typically buy them
all it's a really great way to be able
to try different lipsticks try different
lipstick colors and I have found a lot
through these collections that I've been
gone on to repurchase and repurchase in
the full-size like my videos that I've
done with these in the past I'm just
going to go through each one I'm going
to swatch it on my hand swatch on my
lips let you know what I think about it
and then I actually also have two extra
ones here for a giveaway so just like I
did last time there will be one YouTube
winner and also one Instagram winner so
if you're interested in winning one of
the give me some nude lip collections at
for yourself watch towards the end
because I will run through the giveaway
rules and details but why don't we go
ahead and jump into some swatches from
the new at Sephora give me some nude lip
collection and when you open it up this
is what's the inside of it looks like
again like I said it's $28 it comes with
five deluxe sized samples that look like
this and then we do have one full-sized
product in here definitely don't mind
getting a deluxe sample it is so hard to
go through a lipstick especially when
you're an addict and you own so many
different lipsticks I don't mind getting
minis they're easier to travel with and
like I said it's just hard to go through
a lipstick so these are all nudes and of
course as always going to depend on skin
tone of what nude means to you usually
when I've gotten these nudes in the past
they really do range from like beige
nudes
- like brown nudes it just kind of
depends so I'm excited to see what we
have in here so first up I do see this
from bite Beauty I have tried to bite
lipsticks before but this is in the
shade brioche and I have not tried that
shade so that's cute
so that is what brioche from bite Beauty
it looks like so I'm just going to go
ahead and do a quick swatch oh that's
really pretty and say this one is kind
of like a mauve new to me I'm going to
go ahead and get this on my lips so this
is brioche from bite Beauty it
definitely is a very dark nude so again
depending on your skin tone like I don't
even know if I would consider this like
super nude on me but it still is a very
pretty shade I do like the bite
lipsticks more of what's the regular
creamy lipstick but what I've tried from
bite Beauty in the past is that they are
pretty long lasting as well so this is
the first one brioche from bite Beauty
so next up I grabbed out one from Make
Up For Ever and I'm excite exciting I've
ever tried the regular Make Up For Ever
lipsticks I try a liquid lip from them
this is the artist Rouge creme and it is
in the shade c21 one so this is what
this one looks like and then excited to
see the shade ooh is really pretty too
so this is what the makeup forever shade
looks like I will swatch it next to the
bite Beauty so this one definitely has
more of a pink mob vibe I'll go ahead
and try this on my lips
so this is what I see 201 1 from Make Up
For Ever they have some of the strangest
shave names so this one left on my list
so this one is actually much more pink
than I thought it was going to be when i
swatched it it was more on the mob side
but it definitely came out I don't know
if it will show on camera but in person
it's definitely a lot more pink than I
thought it was going to be but it is
super super creamy that was the first
thing that I noticed like it really took
me nothing to apply it to my bottom lip
because it is super super creamy so I'm
excited this is like my favorite part of
why I love buying these sets is because
I get to try new lipsticks and see how I
love them so I'm excited to try out
makeup forever so next up we have a
lipstick from Tarte cosmetics this is
one of their rainforest of the sea color
splash lipsticks and it is in the shade
rum punch I'm really excited because I
actually own two of these and I love
these lipsticks I have wanted to buy
more shades for such a long time and rum
punch was actually on my list I'm really
excited to see what I think of it oh man
this just looks like my shade there is
what rum punch looks like and this one
yeah this is like my kind of mood right
there oh that is so pretty okay let's
see what it looks like on the lips
so this is run punch and I am freaking
obsessed I am so mad at myself that I
did not buy the shade sooner because
this is my type of nude this is gorgeous
I love these Tarte lipsticks like I said
I own two of them one more of a brown
nude and one more of a red so I'm really
excited to have like my perfect pinky
nude they are super long-lasting they're
very creamy
they just feel nice on the lips but they
have a good staying power as well so I'm
so excited to add rum punch to my
collection this is my favorite so far
except we have from buxom this is one of
their full-on lip creams in the shade
dolly so this is what this one looks
like I know we have gotten the full on
lip creams from buxom in the past so
these are more of a lip gloss type and I
think these are the ones that actually
do a little bit of plumping that is it
right there I think these are the ones
I'll know once I start to put it on my
lips because if it is plumping I'll feel
it start to tingle right away so this is
a buxom dolly it might not be the best
representation because my lips are
already kind of pigment it from wiping
them off but this is what the gloss
looks like and it is one that does plump
up your lips because you can immediately
tell because your lips start to tingle
it's not anything that's too
overwhelming like the Too Faced lip
injection gloss is actually like painful
that came in the last one and I had to
wipe it off right away it was like
stinging my lips so bad Susan
overwhelming in any way but it will kind
of plump up your lips a little bit I'm
not a huge fan of lip glosses and I
think maybe I've reached for my other
buxom gloss like once or twice like I
just don't reach for them at time but if
they can be nice to layer over a liquid
lipstick if you need to give your lips a
bit of a boost or if you just want some
sort of color but you don't want to do
like a full-on liquid lip or something
but this one is dolly from buxom if I
have the full size here this is from CIT
London it's one of their liquid velvet
and this is in the shade bittersweet so
I'm really excited about this because I
have never tried I don't think anything
from ciji London I can't recall anything
that I have from them so I have
definitely never try
our lip products so there is that last
one is bittersweet so this one has
definitely have like some greyish mauve
tones to it so I'll be curious to see
what I think of this one on my lips and
the applicator is pretty flat all the
other ones have been pretty standard
applicators but this one is kind of more
of like the flat on both sides
so this is what the CIA London
bittersweet looks like on me I have to
say I like it more on my list and I did
in the swatch I thought maybe it was
going to be a little bit too great I
mean it's definitely great owned that
like gray vibe to it but not too much
where it can make me look more unlike
the dead side because sometimes that's
what great lipsticks conduce me I
actually do really like it a lot on the
list I also notice that is very very
pigmented is very very opaque like it
like one swipe you could tell it was
going to cover my whole lips it is still
drying right now but it actually feels
very comfortable on the lips I really do
like that shade actually the more I'm
looking at it the more I do like them
and these run for $19 and I thought was
interesting when I listed up on the
Sephora site it also made reference that
these are the moisturizing matte liquid
lipstick so maybe that's why it's more
comfortable but I've never I don't think
I've ever seen moisturizing and liquid
lipstick in the same sentence because
usually a liquid lipsticks are more
drying but it says these are
moisturizing and I can definitely tell
they're very comfortable so I'll be
excited to see how the long wear works
on these but this one from CIA London
and bitter sweet pretty excited about
this one and the final item in there is
a liquid lipstick from my Kat Von D one
of the everlasting liquid lipsticks and
this is in the shade Ludwig or Ludwig
I've had people not tell me I'm saying
it wrong both ways people say Ludwig
people say will be big I don't know what
to do so there's that but that is the
Wonder from Kat Von D I do actually own
this liquid lipstick it's one of my
absolute favorite so again this is in
the shade Ludwig and man I just think
it's gorgeous it's one of my favorites
favorite news I think I mentioned this
in my favorite nude liquid lipsticks
it's just my type of nude and I think it
is stunning
so this is Ludwig from Kat Von D on my
lips I love it it's just one of my
favorite news it almost kind of reminds
me of rum punch from Tarte but in the
liquid lipstick form too obsessed with
it I am not mad to get a mini click I
said this is what I will take traveling
with me versus bringing along my
full-size and it's just one of my
favorite liquid lipstick formulas it's a
very thin formula and it's more
comfortable on the lips to me and I
think that they're very long-lasting I
reach for my Kat Von D lipsticks quite a
bit when I am going out who's actually
one of my choices to wear out tonight
I'm going to Iowa State Fair tonight and
so I might just leave this one on
because I think it's gorgeous so those
are all of the lipsticks that came and
this give me some nude lips I'm actually
really excited because the last give me
some nude lips I thought it was a Miss
for me which is surprising I think that
was my very first mist ever was it give
me some nude lip collection I just
wasn't super excited about it some of
the shades networks for me from the
formulas I didn't love it just wasn't
overall mist for me so I'm so excited
that this one is a hit I have to say I
mean I love getting the Kat Von D
because I love this liquid lipstick the
Tarte rum punch
I loved that color so much I'm really
excited about that CIA Lebanon I'm
excited to try it more and to try a new
product to me and saying what the makeup
forever I'm excited to play with that
one a little bit more the only one that
I don't feel like I was super excited
for was that buxom fold on lip polish
because I have one and I just don't
reach for it a lot but other than that I
was super happy with all the lipsticks
