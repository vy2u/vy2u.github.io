super excited for today's video because
it's going to be all about the new
Sephora favorites doing some nude lip
collection this just was released on
Sephora this new set I bought it to the
morning that I went live because I was
so excited about it I couldn't wait for
it if you guys are not new to my
channels and you know that I love the
Sephora favorites says I think they are
really really good values but especially
the lip lines are my favorite because
I'm such a lipstick attic and in
particular when they come out with nude
lips I'm like yes please because I love
nude lips now the left hand that they
came out with a new to lip collection I
did a swatch video where I show you each
of the lipsticks inside I just went a
little bit about it put them on my lips
to let you know what I think and I also
hosted a giveaway and I'm doing the same
thing this time I bought two extra one
I'll be giving one away to an Instagram
winner and then one away to a YouTube
winner so you will have two different
chances to win your own new give me some
nude lip set from Sephora so make sure
you watch to the end and I will be going
over the giveaway details for that but
if you would like to see what is inside
this new cute little package and some
Sargeant's of each of the lipsticks
inside then let's just get to it alright
so the Sephora favorites
give me some nude lip here is what the
packaging looks like I love these
they're always shaped like glyphs I
think they're super cute $28 on this for
website the timer buildings are still in
stock sometimes I do go out of stock but
Sephora will typically bring the back
but there are times where I've looked
and I've seen that it's out of stock and
then like the next week it's back in
stock and inside we have six different
lip products now there's going to be
five deluxe sized lipsticks in here and
then there's going to be one full size
which i think is really amazing so this
$28 the full-size lipstick in here would
cost you $18 so $18 plus the five deluxe
sized samples that you're getting I do
not think $28 is about price at all and
I was really excited about it because
inside we have an outside via Beverly
Hills lip gloss which I have never tried
so I'm super excited to try it out a
two-faced lip injection glossy never
tried out very excited about that the
Marc Jacobs lip gloss and sugar sugar I
have the full size of this merch a cup
lip gloss which is amazing it's one of
my favorite take it everywhere with me
and I travel with
I'm always sell paranoid because it is
by far my most expensive lipgloss like
it's practically one of my most
expensive lip products I'm always so
afraid it's going to fall out my clutch
arm a little bit or leave it behind so
there is the deluxe size in here so that
is what I'm going to be taking traveling
with me because I won't be so paranoid
we also have a Tarte lippy Alondra ray
and then a NARS Velvet Glide lipstick
which I'm very excited about because I
haven't tried those either and I hear
really good things about them and then
the full-size is an urban decay of ice
liquid lipstick which I am thrilled to
try because I have it and I think that's
awesome that we get a full-size of
course everything is going to be more in
like the nude category of course it's
going to depend on your skin tone and
what nude means to you if you haven't
tried anything inside of these kits
which you've always wanted to this is a
really good time to do it so I'm going
to walk through each of the six
lipsticks inside I'm going to do a
swatch on my hand and then I'm also
going to put them on my list and let you
know what I think about them so let's
jump into lipstick number one so the
first one that we have is this alipio
lingerie from Tarte so this is what it
looks like and it is in the shade
revealed which from the website is
described as a light mocha this was the
only one that I wasn't excited about in
here because I'm not really a fan of
like the crayon lippies I actually have
a couple from Tarte and I just never use
them I think I've declared them even
before I did my last lipstick and
clutter I'm just not a huge fan myself
that's a really pretty color though one
is definitely like it said mocha it is a
brown nude and it looks to have like a
satin matte finish to it so I'll go
ahead and get this on my lips
so here is what revealed from the tarte
whippy lingerie
lipstick looks like i'm not a super huge
fan it get really like the korean
applicator and i feel like it's kind of
hard I like something a little bit more
precise I feel like this would be good
like you'd have to kind of use a lip
liner to make sure that you're getting
too precise lips edges so that's kind of
a bummer to me the colors are really
pretty those to me it's definitely more
of like a dark brown like this wouldn't
be a nude brown on me this is definitely
more round on my list and from my skin
tone but it's nice it has the satin
finish its kind of creamy so you know I
can rub my lips together it's pretty but
honestly I just I don't see myself
reaching for this this was the only one
that I was like full about this like met
what I wanted to try out in this
collection still a nice little thickness
Brown lipstick and if you do like these
tartlet leaves then I feel like that's a
good deal because even though it is a
smaller size I mean you are still
getting a lot of product so that is
revealed from Tarte is so mixed up like
I mentioned there's the Marc Jacobs
sugar sugar lip gloss in here and like I
said I do have the full size of version
and I love this lip gloss this was a
huge recommendation from Jaclyn hill she
is always raving about it the full-size
lip gloss is $28 right $28 and that is
expensive like I have trouble paying $20
for a liquid lipstick and this is 28 for
a lip gloss I was like oh my gosh but
I've been super happy with it okay so
there is the swatch of that a lot of
times I don't wear it alone how I really
like to wear it is have like a nude or
brown nude liquid lipstick on and then I
chopstick lip gloss over it and a lot of
times if I know I'm going to be gone for
a very long time this is what I'm
grabbing because like throughout the
night if my lipstick starts to fade I
just pop a little bit of gloss over and
it kind of like revives my list so
that's why I really really love it for
so I'm very very happy to have the
little travel guy of it so let me get
this on my lips and show you what it
looks like again it will be by itself
even though my lips like I had a
lipstick on took it off then put the
chart went on then took it off so my
lips are already kind of like what were
you doing it
this is what the lipgloss looks like is
the Marc Jacobs sugar sugar I am
extremely happy to have a little guy
this the next one is from two-faced it's
the lip injection philosophy which says
it's a juicy color plumping a lip gloss
and it is in the shade spice girl I have
not tried any of these a two-faced
liquid lipstick came at believe it was
in the last one it was in the shade
queen bee and I really really enjoyed
that I love the color I really really
like that formula I'm excited to try out
the lip injection so it's supposed to be
a clumping lip gloss I would say D Marc
Jacobs there's definitely more opaque
than the two-faced one I had to do to
swatches to build it up so you can like
maybe kind of see I mean it's a gloss so
it's not like it's going to be like
super super pigmented it by any means to
be on with the peachy nude side
let me go ahead and try this one on my
lips so I have it on my lips um color
wise it really it didn't do much color
wise I feel like the Marc Jacobs one you
can actually see that there was some
sort of color on my lips this one just
almost looks more glossy and I think the
pigmentation from my lips is just from
being scrubbing at my lips doing these
lip swatches so the color is kind of
disappointing to me but this is actually
really uncomfortable and I want to take
it off I have the buxom lipgloss and
white Russian it actually came in a
previous so for a nude favorite and I
really like that and that's a plumping
lip gloss and it definitely gives you
like the tingly feeling but this is like
a burning feeling like my lips are hot
like they feel hot I don't think I like
this I'm not sure how long like the the
tingling feeling would last because
after a while the buxom one does kind of
died down but no this is actually like
kind of painful I'm gonna I'm going to
take this one off because this this one
kind of hurts I said I did wipe off the
lip gloss but I still like I feel like I
can still feel that like tingling on my
lips like it's not even like it's just
tingling in my lips are like hot like I
feel like they
are hot and supposed to like be Fanning
my lips this whole time so yeah I don't
know I don't really like that one
I guess I can kind of already tell that
my looks lips look plumper but again it
might just be because I'm doing the lip
swatches but I don't think that I'm
going to be a fan of this like I don't I
don't want to put this back on my lips
because I don't like the way that it
made my lips feel I don't like this one
I don't like this one guys I'm moving on
to the next one we have another lip
gloss this is from i'm susie beverly
hills and it's in the shade Kristin
which is described as a cool desert sand
I have no idea what that is supposed to
mean but this is Kristin I've never
tried any of the anastacio lip glosses
so I'm curious to give this a shot and
hear really good things about it and
this is incredibly pigmented for a lip
gloss like whoa okay
there's Kristin you know just like the
biggest swatch in the world in case you
were going to miss it
that looks really pretty I'm excited to
put this on my lips like I mean it
definitely is glossy but it has a ton of
pigment to it so let's see if my lips
are still burning that one was so weird
so this is Kristin from Anasazi Beverly
Hills
I am super impressed with it I wasn't
really sure and at first I was kind of
like okay we're getting like three lip
glosses in a row like that's kind of
disappointing but the Marc Jacobs is a
very good one is to put in there and now
this one was how it looks like this is
gorgeous it doesn't even feel like a lip
gloss like it's not sticky at all it
feels like a creamy lipstick I'm very
happy very pigmented it's such a pretty
pink or cool desert sand
according to Sephora don't no idea what
that means but yeah this is gorgeous I'm
definitely going to be wearing this one
that has me really excited I actually
don't really like to I'm Sofia I'll
liquid lipsticks but the lip gloss is
like yeah I'll really like this okay I'm
glad we only have two left because my
lips and just general lip area asharam
to look a little bit on the crazy side
but tulip so this one is a NARS Velvet
lip guide lips glide and it is in the
shade bound which is described as a rose
pink I really do not have much from NARS
and I'm really excited to try these
because I subscribed as a rose pink but
it looks kind of on the Mavi side to me
is a swatch of bound and sorry I do hope
it's on with my life so apologize again
if my legs are kind of crazy I mentioned
in my last thing goes by well I buy a
video that I am pre filming because I'm
getting a wisdom tooth extracted on
Thursday May 4th so I'm trying to pre
film but we are total like thunder storm
rain clouds every day so I've had to try
to figure out my softboxes to set them
up so I can make sure I sound because
I'm going to need a couple days off from
filming after I get the tooth pulled
which a very nervous about
if so this is what found from nars it
looks like on my list now I went to look
it out because I thought this was a
liquid lipstick but as I was putting it
on I was like is this lip gloss what is
this from the supporter website it says
it's an innovative long-lasting lip
color with a smooth semi matte finish
that provides ultimate hydration so
definitely not a liquid lipstick it
would be like I guess somewhere in
between I think I would have to be able
to wear it for like a full day to really
understand like how well it drives down
and how long did it last
but it's definitely like it feels more
almost like that on Astacio lip gloss
like it doesn't feel necessarily like a
gloss but it kind of just feels like
that creamy lipstick type of feeling I
would say definitely like I could tell
boy stur izing and hydrating on my list
which is very interesting I really
enjoyed this color this is such a neat
color I think it is really beautiful
even though my lips are looking a little
on the crazy side I do think it's really
beautiful so this is very interesting
I'm excited to give this a try and see
how well it lasts and how long it lasts
on the lips but again this is bound from
NARS again this is the one that I'm
probably the most excited about this is
our full-sized product and this is a
liquid lipstick which I just I really do
enjoy with lipsticks and ones that dry
dogmas and this is the urban decay it is
their vice a liquid lipstick and the
shade is in trivial which is described
as a nude pink so I'm very curious to
give this a try again I don't have a
whole ton from Urban Decay but in these
last ones they had an Urban Decay
regular lipstick I think like the Vice
lipstick I believe the shade was in 1993
and I loved it I have worn it several
times it's like it was so pretty I was
very impressed with it not happy that it
came in these sets because a lot of
times in these sets there's items that I
wouldn't necessarily have purchased
unless they came in it so this is what
the Urban Decay lipstick looks like in
trivial it's definitely like the rosy
pink shades so I don't know if this will
be to thing for me but let me go ahead
and get this on my lips and see what I
think
so this one I mean on the Sephora page
for this collection it has like the
description behind each a lipstick and
it says this one is a pink nude it is
not saying that it's a metallic lip but
it definitely is like I was putting it
on I was like that has silver in it and
then I realized it's metallic and I
don't really I'm not a huge fan of
metallic lips regardless this is a
pretty pink for me I'm more like pink
nude pink mauve like straight pink
lipstick I don't know if I feel like
they look like super fantastic on me so
the shade isn't like a hundred percent
mine but it's still pretty but with the
metallic finish it's not a super bold
metallic lip but it still definitely is
metallic and it's not really my favorite
it was pretty sticky when I put it on
but it has very down completely matte
and it's very very comfortable on my
lips again I won't be able to test the
longevity of it until I get to wear it
for a full day but I mean it went on
smoothly it feels very comfortable like
my lips don't feel like really dry or
cracking like some liquid lipstick skin
I'm just really bummed that it's
metallic and I'm not super into the
shade so I don't also try it for like a
full day and see what I think but it's
working in the mirror and I'm like it's
just not totally my cup of tea but this
one is trivial from Urban Decay when if
they're liquid lipsticks and splinted in
a metallic finish for guys so that is
all of the lipsticks that are inside the
newest give me some nude lips from the
sephora favorites collection so what do
I think about this one
to be honest I was like super stoked for
this one I saw like a teaser photo get
posted on Instagram and I was pumped
when I saw anastasiya and Marc Jacobs
NARS Urban Decay I was like oh my gosh
this is going to be the best one and
honestly like I'm pretty underwhelmed
which has me really fun and it also
could be because the last give me some
news lips was fantastic like I think
every single shade in there like hit it
out of the park for me so this one I
just feel like a lot of them are very
hit and miss
again the part I just don't I don't
really like the crayon applicators I
just I don't even think I'll probably
use that one I mean this the Too Faced
lip injection I will not use luckily my
lip stuffs calm down finally but I don't
think I will ever put that on my lips
again the Urban Decay I'm just bummed
because it's a metallic finish and even
though it's not like super super
metallic II it's just it's not my
favorite color either so I'm not sure
how much where I'll actually get out of
this one which kind of bums me out these
three I did like again I'm glad and know
that I have the Marc Jacobs that I'm
really really glad to have a more travel
version of it the NARS I really want to
try out for a whole day like I think
this is going to be the one that let the
next time I do my makeup this is what
I'm going to put on and I really want to
see how it lasts because I'm very
curious about the formula but I loved
this color so I'm excited to have that
NARS one and then the on Sunday lip
gloss was like fantastic I know I heard
a lot of people say good things about
honest anasazi lip glosses but I think
because I'm just not a huge blob person
I was like whatever these are actually
those I was very impressed by that
so I mean out of the six I'm really most
excited only for threes and there's a
couple in here that you know I don't
even think over any use out of which is
kind of a bummer but that's okay I'm
still glad that I got to try them out
and I am glad that I do have these three
in here again
the NARS and the anastacio I might not
have ever tried how to not come in this
collection and then now you know these
are too like potential favorites or at
least potential I really really like
those so I'm not I don't regret buying
the collection by any means I will buy
the next new to Sephora lips that comes
out it's just not my favorite one from
the collection so those are kind of my
thoughts and feedback on it what I say
it's worth it I still do think that it's
worth it at the $28 I don't think that's
a bad price at all especially if you
haven't tried any of these lipsticks if
you have all six of these then I don't
think it's going to be worth it for you
but if you want to try them out and
there's like particular ones in here

say definitely give it a whirl so I will
