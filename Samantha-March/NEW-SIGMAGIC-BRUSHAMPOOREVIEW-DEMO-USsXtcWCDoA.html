am so excited for today's video I'm
going to be going over a brand new
product see with a beauty community and
I'm just super grateful to be talking
about this because I received this box
in the mail not too long ago it is from
sigma beauty they are coming out with a
new product called the cig magic it is
the brush shampoo so when I opened it up
this is kind of what it looked like and
then the seg magic brush shampoo is in
here it was on the go raised platform so
when I opened it up it was like what I
am and I was like whoa this is so cool I
don't think I've ever gotten like oh
cool package like this before so I was
pretty excited about it super super
grateful to sigma beauty for sending me
this i am an affiliate with sigma and
everyone's tomorrow they'll send me
packages of like new releases i recently
did my instagram body makeup tutorial on
here and i use the new baking and
strobing brushes that Sigma sent me and
I just want to say thank you because you
know I'm still a very small channel and
so to get any sort of PR package is just
it's so overwhelming in such a good way
I was really really excited to get this
product not only because i have already
been seeing a ton of hype around the
stake magic but you know we get very
excited over makeup and the eyeshadow
palettes and the lipsticks and the
foundations etc etc you know even makeup
brushes but what is kind of like the
foundation of a lot of this makeup that
we put on its makeup brushes and if you
don't have clean makeup brushes you're
not doing yourself any favors cleaning
makeup brushes is you know it can be a
chore sometimes and it can be not fun to
do but it has to be done otherwise every
time you put more makeup on your face
with those makeup brushes you're just
putting a key stuff on your face and
bacteria on your face it's not going to
be good for your skin skin is obviously
the most important it just all goes back
to having clean makeup brushes so to me
I was like what's better than getting a
makeup brush cleaner to me that was
awesome so I'm just going to talk a
little bit about the cig magic give you
some of the highlight points I am going
to try to get this video up on the day
that it launches so hopefully i will do
that but if you check the description
box it down below i will have the link
to where you can purchase your own i
will also insert clips in here of
showing a demo of me actually using the
products on my makeup brushes and my
makeup sponges so those will be popping
in throughout this video oh yeah again
just super grateful to get this product
very excited to try it out and just so
glad to have a like real makeup brush
cleaner in my house because really the
only thing that i was doing to clean my
makeup brushes right now was using soap
like a lot of times i would just use a
dove bar of soap sometimes i would put
just like coconut oil on the Dove soap
to kind of make it not as harsh almost
kind of like act as a conditioner for my
brushes i do have a makeup brush
cleaning video i can leave that link
down below if you're how i was cleaning
my makeup brushes but one was using dove
soap and then one was just using like i
think it was like the dial soap and just
doing a few pumps of that and then again
putting some coconut oil in there so not
only is this like a true brush cleaner
which makes me really excited but i
don't have to worry about mixing
anything like I was always adding in
coconut oil to the soaps that i was
using so this is going to be a time
saver for me and this is also one
hundred percent natural which is amazing
because like i was saying earlier it
doesn't matter what you clean your
makeup brushes with because those makeup
brushes are touching your face so you
want to be cognizant of what exactly it
is that you're putting on your makeup
brushes because your brushes are then
going on your face and skin care is
obviously a huge key to having a
flawless face and having a good makeup
application is your skin underneath so
for this to be one hundred percent
natural i thought that is amazing so
going off my little card here the
worldwide launch a for the sake magic
brush shampoo is going to be october
24th hopefully that is the day that
you're watching this video again check
the description box for the link to get
your own and this is only fifteen
dollars which i honestly thought it
would be more only fifteen dollars and
it is 5.1 fluid ounces so i think that
is a good price or getting a big product
and again it's kind of like the key to
our makeup is having good skin and that
means good clean brushes so i was pretty
excited
about that again it's a hundred percent
natural one hundred percent clean it
uses virgin it coconut oil and virgin
palm oil is ethically sourced there's no
additives or preservatives and it says
that it helps break down buildup there's
no stiff residue so the way that I use
this on the back it says that you pump
this one two three times directly into
damp brush fibers and lather rinse
repeat as needed so that is exactly what
I did I just said some pumps on the
brush directly and then I used my Sigma
Express glove to clean them this is
essentially what i use to clean my
brushes every single time unless i'm
just doing dove soap for like my makeup
sponges or just like smaller like I
brushes sometimes I'll just use the dev
cell but especially for larger brushes
or if I'm doing a lot at one time I used
this and it is amazing I will leave a
link down below there's an even bigger
version of this as well it just makes
brush cleaning so easy and has all these
like little ridges and grooves you can
see mine is still wet because I did just
use it and has all these like ridges and
grooves to really help get in there and
clean out all of the brushes it's just
it's made brush cleaning so easy and now
you mix in with this I'm like it's going
to take me five minutes to clean my
makeup brushes and that's awesome
because it is it's a chore it's dirty no
one really likes to do it who likes to
clean I don't so to have these two now
unlike brush cleaning made easy thank
you very much Sigma that's a on here
that it is fragrance free and I would
agree with that like I even brought the
bottle up to my nose I couldn't smell
anything with it so that's good the only
thing I'll say is that it says to pump
pump one two three times directly into
damp brush fibers it does say repeat as
need it I found myself needing more
around like six pumps of this for each
brush I brushes you know really only
need it like one to do because they're
so small but especially like my bigger
brushes like my Sigma f80 and even my
like new Sigma concealer brush it's
still smaller than a foundation brush
but they need between i would say on
average six pumps I you know between
four and six depending on size but
larger brushes definitely need it more
like six pumps that's the only thing
that like I was like
maybe that's a con to it and I don't
think that you can really even consider
that a con because I still felt like i
was using less product with this then i
was using the soap and the coconut oil
and mixing everything so had they just
want to point that out because when I
was first starting I was only using the
three pumps and I was like wait a second
they're not completely clean so so when
it came to cleaning the brushes I found
it very easy I got the brush stamp put
the couple pumps on here and then just
rubbed it into my segment my club it
foamed very very quickly you could see
the makeup products coming off you can
see the foundation of the concealer on
my Sigma Matt it rinsed off very easily
I didn't have any problems like not
being able to rinse it out because
sometimes was soaked like you can still
like even after you've rinsed it so many
times and use your hand to like wipe it
off you're still getting soap suds in
there I didn't find that to be an issue
at all which I thought was awesome
because once again that's like a time
saver instead of constantly sitting
there rinsing rinsing rinsing it's it's
much quicker than that so I thought that
was good I was very impressed though
when I use this with my makeup sponge
what I was I was so impressed it cleaned
so easily and I was so mad because I
picked my dirtiest Beauty Blender to
claim first and I turned my camera on
and I zoomed it into the sink and i
forgot the hit record and my reaction
was so hysterical i was so excited I was
like making the beauty blenders dance I
was given thumbs up to the camera
because I was like did you guys see that
and then I looked and it wasn't
recording I was like nope nope you
didn't see that so I did it on my other
tooth you could still see a demo but it
was so quick mostly when I clean my
makeup sponges I'm using just the
borrowed dial soap and I'm rubbing the
sponge and rubbing the Sun and rubbing
this bunch and then I'm rinsing it off
and then I'm turning it over revving
this but it takes so long to clean my
beauty blenders that I'll admit like I
have I think for beauty blenders which
obviously isn't a ton and if I use them
everyday like sometimes I really try to
clean them right away because it's
easier to clean them right away up and
I'm like it's so time consuming my hands
like turn into like raisins because
they're under the water for so long
it's just it's just not fun so impressed
with how quickly these cleaned my Real
Techniques punch the first one that I
used was filthy because I just poured
the foundation right on the Real
Techniques sponge and it was like a
super super dark brown it was so gross I
found what this i needed about four
pumps / beauty blender which I didn't
think was bad at all and it cleaned it
like that I didn't need any extra pumps
I didn't need to do anything else I put
the four on there I got the beauty
blunder damp I put the four pumps on
their rubbed it against my Sigma glove
again and I mean within 10-15 seconds
the Beauty Blender was completely clean
I was shocked I was shocked I was so
impressed this is going to make my life
so much easier with cleaning those
beauty blenders because it went so
quickly no fuss no hassle super
impressed so one last thing that I want
to say about this that I've seen is that
you do want to make sure that you mix it
in with water so you're either getting
your brushes damp first and then using
it or I've seen people even like I think
this was on Sigma's website they filled
like a cup up with the water and then
put some of this in there and dumped
their brushes in there I don't know if
that's the best way to clean brushes but
I saw it on the Sigma website that
that's how they did it or if you're
using like a glove or a mat or anything
like that just getting that wet first
two and then putting some pumps on here
or directly on the brush you just want
to make sure you mix it with water that
is one thing that I've seen from the
Sigma website that you want to make sure
you do but that's really about it that's
kind of my experience hopefully I was
able to put some of the demo in here
that's my feedback on it my first
impressions you know I've only used this
one time for about 10 different brushes
and three makeup sponges but very
impressed this is going to cut down not
only my makeup brush cleaning prep
because now I'm not mixing in different
products everything is all in here and
one so that's going to cut it down it's
going to make my makeup brushes clean
it's good for you it's good if it's
going to be good for your skin it's a
hundred percent natural I'm impressed I
really I really impressed I am so
grateful for sig much sending me this
product because I immediately fell in
love with it I can
not wait to keep using it so again the
launch date is october twenty fourth the
price is fifteen dollars so no one more
else i can say i give this product a
very impressed with it very happy with
it something that i will definitely
definitely keep using so again there
will be a link in the description box
below and there will be a link in the
description box down below to the sigma
website if you do want to purchase this
like i said i've seen a lot of hype
around it i don't know if this is a
product that would necessarily sell out
but i've been seeing a lot of hype so
far about it because people are just
really really excited over this and i
just think it's a tool that you know
brush cleaning is so so important it's
something that we have to do in our
makeup routine like it just it has to be
done so to have such a clean makeup
brush cleaner coming out it's awesome i
think is the floor i think me myself i
