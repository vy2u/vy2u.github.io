I'm so excited for today's video it's
going to be a new makeup tutorial and
there's glitter involved so of course
this is my new year's eve makeup
tutorial I'm so so excited to be doing
this but I'm also super excited about
this tutorial because it is a collab
video with my beautiful friend kcv if
you're not familiar with Casey's channel
and yet you must must must go check her
out I will leave her channel link down
below I hope that you will go check out
her channel subscribe let her know I
sent you great reviews and tutorials
demos I mean she's got a lot of great
content over there text message a lot
and I just think that she's an amazing
person she's turned into such a good
friend of mine so when we decided to do
a collab video together I was just so so
excited Casey's video will be linked
down below make sure you go check her
out until her I said hello we are both
doing New Year's Eve makeup tutorials so
I'm excited for this one obviously like
I said a use glitter I have a lot of
highlight I wasn't sure what to do with
the lip so I kind of like mixed it up
with kind of a funky lip combination I
wasn't sure it was going to work out and
I think it did I really love the way
that this came out it's almost kind of
more like you know it's like the typical
New Year's Eve makeup look cuz the
glitter in the highlight but then I
don't know like I'm feeling like kind of
grungy I don't know if it's because of
my top or my choker or just how the lips
came out I don't know what I'm feeling
but it's giving me vibes that I really
really like so I'm super excited because
I'm going grocery shopping in like an
hour and my grocery store is not gonna
know what hit them cuz I'm not taking
any of this off well I might change my
job but my face I'm not taking any of
this off so be prepared small-town Iowa
because I'm about to go get my groceries
make sure to check out Casey's channel
you want to see how I got this makeup
look just please keep watching so I'm
going to start with the eyes and use the
morphe 35o palette which looks like this
so I'm just going to pick up this real
light brown shade right here and my
morphe m4 for one i'm just going to
apply this pretty sloppily into the
crease as a transition color i do
already have my eyes primed with some
concealer and then i just said it with
one of the lighter shades from
pallid as well then I'm going to pick up
this orange e brown shade right here I'm
going to grab my morphe m4 33 it's just
a smaller blending brush blending brush
and then just applied this into the
crease as well I'm not going to lie I
actually have no idea what I'm doing
like sometimes I try to practice looks
ahead of time or like I'll just do a
make a look one day and be like oh
that's what I should do for this look
with this fun I'm kind of just flying by
the seat of my pants so we'll see how it
turns out we're gonna have glitter so
I'm hoping that in the end the glitter
will just make sure to everything
together who can't hum glitter on New
Year's Eve so now I'm going to pick up
this khaki color from the palette and my
morphe g13 this like literally might be
like my favorite shade from this palette
I just love this kind of like khaki what
like baby puke type of color I don't
know I just I love it so I'm going to
place this on to the I focusing it more
on the outer part of the eye but I am
going to bring it in all over the eye
this is going to be what the glitter
will go on top of again just like khaki
and kind of like a gold glitter mix I
don't work where to find out together
though ok so now I'm going to come in
with the glitter this is from urban
decay it's their heavy metal glitter
liner and the shade is in Midnight
Cowboy I have used this a couple times
so far and I really do think it is
amazing my biggest problem with glitters
in the past and like glitter liners and
things like that is that it would really
like irritate and burn my eyes really
really bad I have no irritation no
burning no anything with this liner
which has made me super happy I've tried
it several times in the past I've left
it on all day I've had no problems with
irritation with it and it just looks so
beautiful so this is what the applicator
looks like and then I'm just going to go
ahead and do one coat all over the eyes
but focusing a lot on the inner part of
my eye and then I'll let it dry and
put a second coat on that's kind of what
I've thought to be the best when it
comes to applying this glitter but again
like I just think it is super super
stunning I want to try to keep the
glitter low I don't want to bring it
above my cookies I try not to open my
eye or like blink too soon which I have
already messed up because then the
glitter will transfer so you do want to
try to let it dry as best as you can
before you open or blink or do all that
unless you want the glitter everywhere I
mean then that's that's totally your
choice but I'm trying to keep it as low
as I can right now usually well I'm
waiting for 1i to dry I do the other eye
and then this one is probably a dry by
now so I come on and do a second layer
again focusing mostly on the inner part
of my eye but also taking it all over
and then i'll go ahead and finish off
the second i and just repeat the process
and after the glitter dries i'm going to
take my m4 33 again the smaller blending
brush and just like to cap it once into
that second orange color that we used
and then just run it through the crease
one more time just to blend everything
together and to bring some of that
orange back into play how to make sure
the glitter is dry at this point or else
you're just going to be moving the
glitter around as well for my liner i'm
going to use the tart East double take a
liner I've been trying this out it's a
little hard to get a handle on I've been
getting asked a lot of questions on what
I think about it it's a little bit
difficult to work with but i think as i
get used to it it'll be easier but it's
just it's very smooth and very pigmented
which is great but it's taking a little
bit to a maneuver you have to be a
little careful with it so i went ahead
and finished off this I the liner and
lashes offline just to make a little
easier for me but I'm the temp this size
I have a better time doing this I on
camera so it's going to go ahead and
make my wing like usual
so that wing I don't think was the best
ever like I said I like I feel like I
like the liner I like that it's really
black I like those really smooth I like
the fine tip on it it's just still
pretty hard to navigate and if you it's
I feel like it's really easy to mess up
with and if you mess up it's really
gonna show I don't I wouldn't recommend
this if you're new to do an eyeliner or
you're still practicing a lot like I'm
gonna get it one of these days I feel
like I'm gonna get it I know a lot of
people have said that they really liked
it so I'm still I'm trying but yeah
probably not one that I would recommend
for newbies to winged liner because it's
kind of difficult to navigate but i'll
make you practicing so for lashes i'm
going to use the grand glamour lashes
these are from I lower lashes in
collaboration with Vegas knife they are
super glamorous and full and they're
like the perfect New Year's lashes like
and then I used my kiss adhesive in
black I just got it off amazon so i will
go ahead and pop this one on
and sometimes if I don't particularly
love my wing I think it's okay and I go
for a boulder lash because it can kind
of like help cover things up a little
bit so another plus with these I lower
lashes and then I'm going to switch to
my face for right now thank goodness
because my face is like freaking out I
was trying a new skincare brand and
unfortunately I don't think it's gonna
work out for me so I'm going to go ahead
and Prime using the tart clean slate
timeless primer I'm almost out of it I
didn't realize how much I didn't have
left of it that's sad also I had to turn
my light on it was super bright when I
started filming like to the point where
I was like I think I'm squinting maybe
it's too bright and then apparently the
weather heard me they were like okay
fine we'll make it cloudy so I had to
turn my light on I don't love using my
lights for makeup tutorials because I
feel like sometimes it can do weird
things too like the colors and stuff but
that's that's what we got to work with
right now for foundation i do want to go
for full coverage a lot of times when it
comes to New Year's Eve you get together
whether you're just going to like a
friend's house like myself or if you're
going out somewhere but typically you're
gonna be out for a long time you know
that you want to see in Midnight ring in
the New Year and then probably party a
little bit more after that maybe and so
I definitely like to go for full
coverage and especially with how my skin
is being right now I want full coverage
so I'm going to use the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer one
of my favorite foundations I talked
about this very frequently and how much
I love it it has the big wand applicator
and then I'm just going to go ahead and
make some stripes along my face you know
this is just youtube this is an
Instagram so I didn't feel the need to
like draw hearts and kittens and
rainbows all over my face like we do for
Instagram I'm just kidding I'm just like
I'm just lying um I'm going to use my
Sigma 3d HD kabuki brush to blend it out
because it's like fun little shape right
here I get asked a lot of questions
about you know how do you decide to use
a brush versus a Beauty Blender and that
sort of thing so how I kind of look at
it is when it comes to a brush you
typically will get a fuller coverage
than when using a
Beautyblender because a beauty blender
or makeup sponge you know you want it to
be damp you want to run it under some
water get it damp before you apply it so
typically your foundation application
will be a little bit lighter when you're
using a beauty blender so it really just
depends on what it is that you want like
I said for this look and for this event
I would be going for more full coverage
so that's why I would use a brush to get
the fuller coverage or sometimes what
I'll do like if I want to use like one
of my favorite foundations is the
Maybelline matte and poreless but it is
more of a full coverage foundation but
sometimes it can feel too thick on my
skin like it can almost kind of feel
like suffocating on my skin so I have
found that when i use it with the Beauty
Blender I like it so much better because
it kind of helps sheer it out like I'm
not losing coverage I'm not losing the
effects of the foundation but it just is
is a little bit on the lighter side so
it doesn't feel quite so heavy on my
skin if that makes sense so that's kind
of what I see the difference being
between I brush and a Beauty Blender and
how I decide which it is that I want to
go for or sell for those reasons that I
stated that's why I'm picking to go with
a brush for this particular makeup look
for concealer keeping on the full
coverage trend I'm going to use the
tarts tape tape one of my favorite
concealers I'm hearing this has been
restocked I'm getting a lot of snaps
from people saying that they got this
concealer and how excited they are and
how much they love it and I totally get
that you guys I'm really excited for you
place that underneath my eyes and then
on the center point of my face to
highlight and then I'll use a little bit
to clear up some of these spots as well
or Fiji to to blend up a concealer then
to bake on the under eyes I definitely
would want to bake when we're going for
the more full coverage like I'm going to
use the laura mercier secret brightening
powder I did just get the kat von d
locket brightening powder in peach I
know it's not available yet at least the
last time I checked it's not available
yet for just anybody to purchase so I
wanted to you
the laura mercier but i still i mean i
really do like the laura mercier secret
brightening powder I think it's great I
was starting to run low on it so that's
what I thought it would be a good time
to pick up another one to try out as
well but still really like a great
setting powder and it does brighten the
eyes considerably so I'm just using my
makeup sponge from pure cosmetics I'm
going to place this right on the under
eyes in any other areas where I placed
the concealer and then while that's
baking I'm going to do some cream
contouring with my pure cameo contour
stick one of my favorite contour sticks
the sponge that I was talking about it
does come with the Cameo contour stick
if you do purchase it so that's where I
got the sponge from so I'm just going to
go ahead carve out some cheekbones and
then just do a light forehead contour
honestly I don't really do anything like
super crazy with my contour I just
always like to define my cheekbones I
think my cheekbones are pretty defined
as they are I can get away with just
bronzer or powder contour but some days
I like to just really chisel out the
cheekbones so that's mostly what I use
the cream contouring floor and then I'm
just going to take the same sponge and
blend that out and then I'm going to use
my physicians formula butter bronzer to
just do a little of bronzing and my
Sigma powder sweep brush it's the fo six
it's just a little bit of a smaller
brush I honestly wasn't sure it would be
great for bronzer it's really good for
contour if you want to skip cream
contouring and just come in and contour
but honestly I think it's just fine for
bronzing too so I really do like this
brush ok my camera cut out when i was
browsing but i just friends up my
cheekbones my forehead my jawline and
then I just ran that little brush down
the sides of my nose real quick I don't
really do anything crazy with not nose
contour but that's what I did after my
camera overheated now I'm just going to
take my morphe III and dust away all the
powder to finish off the eyes i'm going
to use the other side of the tart double
take so on the one side it has the like
liquid eyeliner and then on the other is
more of the regular gel pencil liner so
i'm going to go ahead and take that site
and then just
this on my waterline
and then I'll also use it to tight line
as well so I really hate this part
jumping back into the 350 I'm going to
take that like brown orange or shade I'm
grabbing my morphe 36 brush which is
just a small detailed crease brush and
I'm first going to run this color across
the lower lash line I will next pick up
the get a geek alert as well trying to
fall off my chair and just using the
same brush I will put that into the
lower lash line also and I'm going to
grab the glitter liner again and I'm
first going to place i'm just going to
see how i like how this looks i'm going
to place them on the lower lash line
like kind of right in the center to give
it a pop i do like the way that looks
it's like it's not too much on the lower
lash line but look kind of when you tilt
your head you can kind of see the
glitter I thought about putting some on
the inner corner honestly I don't do
inner corner highlights a lot it really
does irritate my eyes so I'm actually
not going to do it i like the way that
it looks on the lower lash line enough
but of course like you want glitter all
over your body you put glitter all over
your body I mean I've seen the challenge
going around of like full phase using
only glitter I cannot imagine doing
something like that to my poor face like
the highlighter challenge about killed
me but I really like the way that that
looks okay that's good that's good
that's good enough for me I'm going to
put the glitter down ah the glitter down
so before putting on my false lashes I
did prime the top lashes with the Max
Factor master precise mascara so I'm
just going to take that again and use
this on my bottom lashes
before I finish off the face i'm going
to need to let my camera cool down for
everybody who uses the sony a 5100 you
know what I'm talking about but
off-camera I'm just gonna do my brows
real quick i'm going to use the benefit
cosmetics goof proof pencil and then set
it with the Ready Set brow and then I
will be back to finish off the face and
the lips finish off the face i'm going
to go into my becca cosmetics and jaclyn
hill face glow palette let's say for
blush yeah I'm gonna go out amaretto I
just love amaretto he was all the time
I'm gonna use my morphe for it's just a
really beautiful neutral blush and i
love it and then for my highlight is
like built the highlighters in here this
is champion pop and this is Prosecco pop
I'm going to use my ELF small tapered
brush and just do a little mixing
together and then place this on to the
cheekbones I mean it's New Years Eve so
I want to really get in there with my
highlights i'm also going to place them
down the bridge of my nose about halfway
down and a little bit on the edge of my
toes to put my nose and a little bit on
the Cupid's bow as well like a lightly
tap the chin lightly in the center of my
forehead just brit lightly low nothing
crazy nothing crazy it's New Years it's
New Years okay for lips when I was
off-camera I had the worst time coming
up with a lip color I don't know why it
was so hard for me today but it was
really hard I'm an acharya combination
that I'm not sure is gonna work but I'm
curious to try it I've been wanting to
wear my color pop ultra satin lip in
point zero it's a collab with Kathleen
life I've been wanting to wear this for
so long but I knew for my new year's eve
look that I also wanted to use my Marc
Jacobs sugar sugar at lip gloss I
typically will pair this lip gloss over
a lipstick I don't love it on its own
just because it's a little bit to like
cheer for me I like to put it over
something so I'm going to try to put it
atop this I
I like point zero i think it's just like
a really cool like cool toned like kind
of brown gray so i'll be real curious to
see what it looks like with the gloss
over it
still really do like this color on its
own though I just think it's such a cool
like unique color I love it so I'm going
to let it dry it down it doesn't dry
completely max it's the ultra satin lip
but i'm gonna let it dry a little bit
and then i'm going to top it with the
marc jacobs sugar sugar like i said i
think this would be a good one
especially to bring with me for New
Year's Eve I brought it along with me
for all of the Christmas celebrations
that we did because like I said I wore a
matte lip each time but like when I felt
it kind of drying out or you know it was
starting to flake off on like the inner
part of my lips I just took some lip
gloss and swiped it on and then it's
super easy like as the lip gloss would
wear away you just put more lip gloss on
and I just found it really handy so I
really do like this lip gloss
so I'm just going to Pat it along the
lips at first
if you like the way that that looks
actually okay hmm okay I kind of like it
kind of like spiced it up a little bit
all right I'm not mad at that I know
this lips is definitely not for
everybody but I really wanted to try out
this color combos in the final step is
going to be to spray my face hold
everything in place this is the pixi by
Petra glomus I really liked it it
definitely does give you a glow so I
don't think that you need to use a lot
of it by any means but I'm just going to
spray my face and then this tutorial is
complete alright guys after you spray
your face then your makeup look is
complete what do you guys think I really
hope that you enjoyed this tutorial I
was kind of winging it I had no idea
what was gonna happen art how this look
was gonna turn out to be really honest
with you guys but I'm actually super
super happy with how it came out I love
the eyes I love the glitter i love the
highlight I love the lips like I love
everything about this look I love it i'm
so excited i will probably now recreate
this even though for New Year's Eve all
I'm doing is going to a friend's house
