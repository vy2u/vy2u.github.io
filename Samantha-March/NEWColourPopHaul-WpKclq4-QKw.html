is going to be my latest colour-pop Paul
now killer pop has recently put out a
new line of their cream gel eyeliners
i'm sure many of you have seen the
videos on them but I got a few of the
cream gel liners in the pencil form and
then also in the pop form and then I
also picked up a few more of the ultra
matte liquid lipsticks because I just
love them so much so if you would like
to see the items that I got in my cloud
a paw paw plus my reviews and swatches
please keep watching i will say that i'm
having to fill them up with the flash on
again which I absolutely hate but it's
dark and gloomy and rainy here again I
do have I think I want to purchase my
real camera finally the camera that I've
wanted is now like on sale at target so
I think I'm gonna get it but if any of
you have like camera recommendations for
YouTube please leave in the comments
below because right now I only film off
my phone and it's very challenging I
really don't know I'm curious how the
camera will make a difference though
because I don't know what to do about
lighting because I just don't have any
good lighting so I don't know if the
camera will really make a huge
difference for that but I just really
don't like the quality of these videos
when I have to use the flash on my phone
I just I don't like the way they like
but I want to get this phone for you
i've put it off long enough so first i
have some of the ultra matte liquid
lipsticks to share with you i picked up
three more i think i have four other
ones as well i'm also a huge fan of the
lippie Stix i just mentioned in one of
my videos how i forgot to order lippie
Stix when I put in this order and I was
severely bummed with myself pop is so
affordable so these ultra matte liquid
lipsticks are six dollars a piece they
are a liquid lipstick they stay on I
mean all day it's crazy i can eat I mean
I can have it on all day licking my lips
and just the lipstick does not go
anywhere it is so great i will say that
i think it's a little bit drying i think
there's some of my lipsticks are more
drying than others but when i first
started wearing the liquid lipsticks to
me they felt dry and I think my lips
just were not used to
and I think now I'm used to own so it
doesn't really bother me much at all I
will say that when I take off the liquid
lipstick at night I usually put some
sort of like exfoliator or scrub on my
lips like I have a sugar scrub for my
lips that I like to use and I will put
that on the nights after because I just
feel like it kind of helps like
rejuvenate my lips again and I got is
trap Oh trap is like the gray mauve
shade and a lot of people have really
enjoyed trap and I have to say so that's
trap right there I'm like obsessed with
it I love it so much when I first got it
and i swatched it I was like I don't
know if it might be like to gray and i
don't i don't know if i'm going to
really love it I love it I think it
looks amazing and I get so many
compliments on it from people that I
wouldn't think would complement my
lipstick a good compliments from them so
that was trap and I love it so the next
one I got is beeper and honestly
especially when i swatched it when i did
the snapchat unboxing for this I had
trap and beeper right next to each other
and I was like I think they kind of look
similar but beeper is definitely darker
so that one is beeper right here so you
can see it next to trap is it's a little
bit of like the deeper mavi shade maybe
with like a hint of brown in it just
like a just like a smidgen but again i
love this one and this one I don't know
when I first put it on I was like hey I
don't know if I'm going to love it and
then it dried so like it actually will
look like because when you put it on I
mean it goes on wet and then you wait
just a minute and it will dry matte and
then once it dried I was like this is
beautiful and i love it so that's Bieber
the last one I got is what i have on my
lips right now and it is chilly chilly
now a lot of people have raved about
chili chili i've also heard it be called
chilly chill but it is chilly chilly and
so I got it because I've seen so many
other people talk about it this is one
that looks absolutely nothing like
what's in the tube I mean
you guys I took like a lip picture for
our Instagram where I had it like next
to my lips and I'm like this literally
looks like nothing that it's in the tube
it is like the most bizarre thing if you
can tell from my lips I mean it's
definitely deeper than the other two I
have it's darker than the other two it's
like a reddish brown and again the first
time I wore it when I put it on it
almost like it was too Brown to me like
it actually kind of reminded me of limbo
which is a chocolate brown from
colour-pop that I own and I was like
that's weird I didn't think this was
brown but then when it dried it almost
has that more like like a purple shade
to it I don't know it's so crazy looks
like nothing in the tube I swear to you
guys but this is what it looks like on
if you guys can see it i have posted
pictures on Instagram as well and i
ended up really liking it's really a
good fall shade and almost kind of like
on the vampy side so those are my latest
ultra matte liquid looks lip sticks from
colour-pop again six dollars for the
price I I don't feel like you can be
beat the price of this I think it's
amazing and I'm loving all three of my
guys so I picked up a one of the new
liners in the pot and I picked it up and
get paid and the website describes it as
like a rose gold metallic oh how the
cream gel liners work if you are not
familiar with them as they came out with
I mean like a ton of shades I don't even
know how many there was it would think
it was like 20 or maybe even more but
each color came in pot form and then
also in the pencil form which I will
show naxos so they have like regular
colors as well and then they also had a
few metallic shades I decided to get a
metallic shade in the pot and then the
three pencils that I got were like the
more regular colors now I only got one
in the pot because I had been watching
the reviews and the ones for in the pot
we're not quite as good as the ones for
the pencil liners so I got three pencil
liners it got one of the pot I was like
well I still want to try it out and see
what I think for myself so I got get
paid and I don't know if you guys can
see that with flash that's
that looks like our six dollars so with
the ones in the pot or six dollars the
pencil liners are five so again super
affordable that's how colour-pop rolls
now the one in the pot to me I had some
issues with it first thing was that I
just found it hard to get out like I
just I was having issues picking it up
on my brush and I didn't bring a brush
down here to show you guys so i'll try
to swatch it on my finger so if you can
see that is get paid the metallic rolls
rose gold shade so yeah I had trouble
getting it out and then even just now I
had trouble getting it out because it's
almost like it's super dry or something
like even with my brush I was having to
like go in and scrape it and then I even
switch brushes because I was like
something's wrong with my brush so I
tried a new brush and then it still
didn't work and I'm like oh it's hits
the eyeliner I get it now so I wasn't
super impressed with that but then also
it's almost kind of like crumbly like I
don't know you guys probably won't be
able to see it in the pot but it almost
like it like crumples up and so when I
was putting it with my brush onto my
upper lash line like it was crumbling
and it was falling into my lashes and
onto my cheek and so I was like well
that's not great either the color I love
the color I love the metallic pneus of
it I thought it looked really cool on my
upper lash line especially when the day
that I wore it I did something really
some similar to like what I have on
today just like a light brown kind of
dusted all over nothing crazy and then
the metallic on the upper lash line and
I thought it looked really cool and it
stayed like it has lasting power which
is good but just like the application
part of it was kind of hard so I've used
it twice I used it twice to test it out
and see but then I like find myself not
reaching for cuz I'm like I feel like
gonna like break my brushes I'm gonna
try to get it out so that is the pop
form and then I also got the three
pencils so I was I was just so excited
for these because I just think there's
so much fun like one of my favorite
eyeliners is from maybelline that's the
Maybelline unstoppable and I can't
remember exactly what color they call it
but it's basically just their dark blue
I love wearing dark blue on my waterline
and I love wearing it on the top like
but I've never really switched up colors
more than that so when this line came
out and then these are only five dollars
for the pencil form I was like let's try
a few and see how we do so the one that
I have on my upper lash line today is
best oh and this is like a red and
another really good thing about these
pencils is that they twist up and down
if you guys can see they twist up and
down so it's not like you have to
sharpen them are things like that which
oh absolutely loved I don't have to do
that so yeah this one is like a deep
burgundy red which I just thought was so
awesome for the fall though that is best
oh right here and i love it this is
probably the one that I feel like I'm
attracted to the most and I love wearing
it on my upper lash line I just it's so
dark that it almost looks black but then
you can tell it's not black I don't know
if that makes any sense but I love it
highly enjoying busto especially for the
fall like it's just so perfect for fall
and then another one I picked up is
maybe and this is like a bright green
and this is what I don't know if you'll
be able to see able to have it in my
waterline today as well but it is I mean
it's it's bright so that green right
there is maybe now I've worn this in my
lower lash line like I am today or my
waterline like I am today but then I
also worn it on my upper lash line and
got again so many compliments like
people are like oh it left that green on
your eyes I'm like oh thanks amis feel
like it just it definitely is like an
eye catcher because it's just so bright
it just really makes your eyes pop so
yeah I was getting compliments I mean
even from little kids when I was working
at the school like little kids were
coming up to me like I like your green
eye line
I'm like oh thanks like thank you it
just it's so nice I really really like
maybe last one I picked up is cry baby
is like a violet shade but again it's
like it's bright I don't know if you
guys will be able to tell by the swatch
but it's it's really bright for being
such a light violet shade when I wear it
on my waterline it almost looks like I
have like a white or a really light tan
or cream in my waterline because that's
how bright it is but again I really love
it because it looks like almost more
like a standard color that we would put
in our water line but then if you look
closely you can tell that it's not like
it's got that little bit of lavender in
it a little bit of violet in it and I
just think it's so pretty i have also
worn it on my upper lash line and i
really like it there but I especially
love it for the water line because i
feel like because it's that bright but
still light like it kind of makes your
eyes open up a little bit more and i
really really like that so again the
colors i got were best oh maybe and cry
baby so those are the three that i got
and i am just so impressed with these
not only am i impressed with the colors
especially i mean all three colors
they're just so bright they're so
vibrant they're so creamy like even when
i was watching them in my snapchat hell
i was watching them and I was like okay
like yeah I can get down with this I
love that there with the retractable
pencils we don't have to worry about
sharpening them at any point they're
very easy to use their very easy to
apply the only thing I can't quite
master yet is like making a little wing
with them I'm having a hard time doing
that because I'm so used to doing my
wings with either like felt tips or with
like the small angled brushes so I
haven't quite figured out how to make
the wing that I want with these guys but
I'm going to keep trying i will keep
trying to figure that out and again just
like what the metallic shade that i
mentioned these suckers stay on i don't
know if i have found something that will
stay in your waterline as long as these
do
I really enjoyed the Knicks trays you'll
a gel eyeliner pencil I have mine and
black and I feel like that stays in your
waterline all day I think these might
beat that and i'm pretty sure that
eyeliner was like eleven dollars which
is expensive for a drugstore brand and
these are five I mean they just they
just stay it's so incredible but even on
the upper lash line like I have to tell
you guys the story because I thought it
was so crazy one night I was wearing I'm
pretty sure it was when I was wearing
maybe on my upper lash line so it was
the the bright green and I was using a
makeup wipe to remove my eye makeup you
know I was taking it off just like I
would like normal no swoosh swoosh take
my mascara off okay go to the next day
and then I went to look in the mirror to
like continue washing my face and it was
still on my upper lash line and I had to
go back and really focus on taking it
off I was like holy Toledo I don't think
these were said that they were
waterproof I didn't see that if they did
but I was like those sucker stayed on I
mean I really just had to apply a little
bit more pressure is it snowing I'm
sorry yes Horace Houston flank I almost
lost it I am with lasted I just had to
apply a little bit more pressure and
actually like have my finger over the
pad and rub it on the upper lash line to
get it off and then it was fine so it
wasn't like it refused to budge like
waterproof makeup does but I was like
dang that is impressive so if you are
looking for something that will stay all
day I very highly highly recommend these
eyeliners again they are only five
dollars you just can't beat it so I
definitely love the pencils more than I
do the pot and i will probably i mean i
can definitely see myself picking up
more of the pencils I really do want to
try the metallic and the pencils as well
I can't say that I feel like I'm going
to purchase any more from the pot just
because I really didn't like it but
pencils yeah okay so that is all for my
latest color pop all my swatches and my
reviews I really hope you guys enjoyed
that video if you did please be sure to
give this a thumbs up so I know
if you guys have anything from
colour-pop especially like the ultra
matte liquid lipsticks or any of the new
cream gel eyeliners please do comment
below and let me know what you have how
you like it you know your feedback as
well I'm curious I don't I honestly
don't know if I have seen a positive
review yet for the eyeliners in the pot
so I'm wondering if anyone has had a
better experience or not but again that
really is about the only thing that I've
gotten so far from colour-pop I have
their lippie Stix the blushes the ultra
matte liquid lipsticks and now these
cream gel eyeliners I think the only
thing I have not ordered from colour-pop
is like the actual eye shadows I don't
know why but everything I have loved
loved loved so far so to have just one
product be like not loved I mean I think
that's pretty good and again color pop
is very affordable if you guys are
looking for beauty on a budget you know
we have the holidays coming up I know
you guys are probably Christmas shopping
and spending money and all that good
stuff so you still want to spend a
little bit for yourself without feeling
guilty about it i would definitely check
out color pop i will leave the links to
color pop in the description box below
and then I will also link the specific
products that I've mentioned in here

say for this video I do hope you guys
