today's video I'm going to be showing
you my nighttime skincare routine and
this is my routine when I really want to
pamper myself and just kind of like go
all out with my skincare so I'm excited
to share this with you so what I'll do
first of course is put my unruly hair up
and take out my lashes take out my
lashes take off my lashes because that's
one of the best feelings ever and then i
will first come in and remove my makeup
i really like to use cleansing oils and
this one from dermalogica is their pre
cleanse and it is amazing it smells so
good it smells like you're in a spa when
you put it on your face I just got
completely addicted to the smell the
scent I love it but it's also a
fantastic cleansing oil it takes
everything off in this look I had
glitter on my eyes I took it right off
and i also have on a color pop ultra
matte lip and just watch how easily it
takes that lipstick off it is fantastic
one that i have truly been loving on and
again love the smell so after i wash
that off i will only pop my face dry
once because i want to leave it a little
bit damp because of then I'll come in
with my cleanser this is from juice
beauty and it's the green apple cleanser
I do have a full snapchat or scratch
video all about juice beauty where I do
talk about the cleanser so I can leave
that link down below if you're
interested in checking it out I just
leave this on my face for a few minutes
and then I will go ahead and rinse that
off and then I come in with what I
consider to be kind of the star of the
show this is the daily super Foley and
from dermalogica I've just found this to
be so fascinating I don't have anything
like this in my skincare and I've really
never heard anything like this but
basically what you want to do is pour
this into your very wet hands it's a dry
exfoliant but once it gets mixed in with
water then it activates the exfoliant
and you just put this all over your face
it'll feel like an exfoliator but what
it is is a resurfacing anti-pollution
powder exfoliant and it's to help fight
the biochemical and environmental
triggers known to accelerate skin aging
so how crazy is that right
so this exfoliant is to guard against
damaging effects of pollution and what
that is doing to your skin to the aging
of your skin and I've just had been
really loving on it I do recommend if
you have sensitive skin like me to use
it only every other day instead of daily
then after that I will come in with a
mask when I use the exfoliant I don't
want to use a harsher mask on my skin
because i do have sensitive skin so this
dr. Brandt oxygen facial flash recovery
mask is fantastic it just feels like
bubbles on your skin I like to look at
myself when I have it on because it just
feels crazy and weird but you just apply
it then layer to your clean damp skin
you don't rub it in you only have to
leave it on for three to five minutes
and it'll bubble and it just makes your
skin feel really hydrated and really
smooth and fresh once I rinse that off I
just come in with my dermalogica
moisturizer rub that all over my face of
course moisturizing is like one of my
favorite parts of the day and then I'll
come in with my lancer eye cream and I
just rev up this on my under eyes and I
just use a very small tiny amount but
once that is done then my nighttime
skincare is complete I hope that you
guys enjoyed getting unready with me
please do give this video a thumbs up if
you did make sure you're subscribed
before you go and I'll get you real soon
on my next one bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
