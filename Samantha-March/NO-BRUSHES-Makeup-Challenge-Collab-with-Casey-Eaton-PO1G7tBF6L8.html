channel so today's video is going to be
the null brushes makeup challenge so I
will be applying this makeup to my face
without using any makeup brushes and
this video is actually a collab video
with the beautiful Casey eaten I love
doing collab videos and I've been
watching Casey's videos for quite some
time now and she's a Midwest girl as
well and I just I've really enjoyed
watching her makeup especially her
tutorials she is a great Instagram page
as well so I reached out to her and
asked if she would like to collab so I
was really excited to team up to do the
no makeup brushes challenge I didn't
realize quite how difficult it was going
to be or what products that i would have
to just skip completely because there is
no way you can do them without a brush
so it was very interesting I didn't
practice this at all and I just kind of
went with it it was a little
nerve-wracking but hopefully we made it
through I feel like my makeup is much
lighter the night it normally is for
when I jump on youtube or do a tutorial
but it did use a few different products
in here too so hopefully that's
something new from the normal that I
would normally do but I hope you will
check out Casey's channel and her no
makeup brushes challenge video as well I
will leave her limbs to her YouTube to
her video and to our Instagram page down
below and I sure hope you'll go give her
some love and tell her that I sent you
and now if you would like to see my no
makeup brushes makeup tutorial challenge
thing you know what I'm saying yep I can
keep on with my eyes and I'm going to
use a couple of color pop I shadows and
I'm using color pop because they say
that you can use a brush with color pop
products but they also work really well
with your fingers so there's gonna be a
lot of color pop in here but I thought
we would see how that works I've
actually never applied for Papa with my
fingers like I just always use my
brushes for everything so I'm gonna be
interesting but first I'm going to come
in with plaid which is a green this is
what it looks like and I've already hit
pan on it here we go alright so i did
prime my eyes before I hopped on camera
like I normally do so I'm just going to
come in and lace the green down it feels
weird like not coming in with any sort
of transition color or doing any sort of
blending to start off with but what do
you do and maybe this was really
dangerous to do with the dark color but
again we've already started no going
back okay
okay so i have the green applied I don't
feel like it looks the greatest but i
tried to use a glider pressure as i went
up to give it sort of a blended gradient
effect I don't know about that though
but ok we'll just keep going I'll do the
other eye feels weird feels weird feels
wrong
good good since I was doing a little bit
a little bit better than the other one I
feel like I'm getting like so much
shadow like here and like the dark
recesses of my eyes and I I don't really
want it there because that kind of makes
you look like you have a black guy
especially when i'm using such a dark
shadow but no what do you do supposed to
be fun my blood pressure shouldn't be up
the first green shadow is on looking
great and i'm going to come in with so
quiche and it's basically to me it's
like what i use us like glitter this is
what it looks like it's got like purple
and green hints to it but then it also
has like flecks of gold glitter it's
really pretty and this islek is actually
what i did on the superbowl i think and
i got a lot of compliments on it so i'm
just going to go ahead and pop that over
the plaid feels weird like touching my
eyes like that does not feel that does
not feel natural like I said I like I
never use my fingers to do my eye makeup
but ok so I'm just going to keep putting
the glitter on and I do this too when I
did it like normal the one time that I
did this look like I did a lot of the so
quiche applications so I'm just going to
keep going in as many times as I think I
need and putting so quiche over the
plaid
I feel like I'm getting more fallout
when using my finger than i am using a
brush and that just like does not seem i
would not have guessed that I would have
more fallout using a finger versus using
a brush
the unblended pneus of this look because
usually no matter like what it is I'm
doing I always come in with some sort of
transition color in my crease to blend
everything I did it with this look I do
it with about every look it just feels
like just feels like it looks weird Oh
raro
just gonna wipe wipe that away like it
was never there this is why I always do
my eyes first it's just it's just easier
that way okay that's all I'm doing for
shout out so I'm gonna switch to my face
I'm going to come in with a two-faced
primed and poreless primer to prime my
face with this primed and poreless I
teamed up with a couple girls from
Instagram and we're doing a six by
summer series feature I don't know what
you want to call it but basically we
found six items around our house and we
are determined to use them by summer and
this to face primer is on them I have
this primer for so long like it's
ridiculous and you know you buy new
things and then you stop using the
things that you do have and then you buy
more new things than you stop so when
Kayla from polished and bubbly asked me
to do this I was like that is a really
good idea so I can leave my post my
Instagram page below and then on there
all the other girls are linked on there
as well so you can see what they chose
but I think it's a really good idea
especially if you like to declutter like
me or my like foundation ish i'm going
to use the Maybelline Dream fresh BB
cream it's an eight and one beauty balm
skin Perfector this is what it looks
like I decided to go with this because
normally I don't when I do makeup
tutorials it would this fun this is a
new one I'm not going to use this one
actually hold please so how could I
forget that this is the one that I'm
normally using because it's the exact
same thing it's the Maybelline BB cream
8 in 1 beauty balm but this is a one
that my dog has gotten too can you see
is like the two marks up there and this
was almost brand new I think I used it
two times when she got a hold of it and
I was so upset my husband's like I'll
just duck tape it I was like okay cuz I
didn't wanted like call it quits on it
and I went out and bought another one
just to be on the safe side but I have
yet to open that one but that's why my
poor BB cream looks like that but I
decided to use this like I was saying
because I don't normally use BB creams
on cam
I'm doing more of like the typical
foundation but also when I use BB creams
which honestly is quite frequently like
I don't like to wear heavy foundation
every single day and that's probably not
the best for your skin you like to use
this but also i use my hands I don't
ever use a brush with my BB cream so I
was like hey why not introduce BB cream
to my channel so I also for whatever
reason did not look in the mirror at any
point that I was doing that so can trick
me over here usually when i use a BB
cream it's not as full coverage as a
foundation obviously so I usually come
in with a powder but I don't feel like I
can come out of the powder because how
would you butt around without a brush
like you can't right ok so keeping it
rollin with my face I mean use the
Maybelline fit me concealer this is
another one that was in my um six by
summer so I'm going to use this and I've
been watching some of these videos and a
lot of the other girls are saying like
you can use the applicator but then you
got to use your finger apply it and then
use your finger days where I don't use
foundation or like I'm going for a more
like natural face look I won't do
concealer like all over my face and
that's what I feel like today is going
to be and I feel like it's going to be
hard enough to try to like blend this
with my finger but I'm going to give it
a try so that's I am only going to do it
on my under eyes I typically will always
always always do concealer on my under
eyes like they just made it especially
because I've had a sick dog and we have
not been getting a whole lot of sleep
because she's up all night coughing so
yeah I definitely always do concealer
under my under eyes but I don't
typically always do it all over the rest
of my face like I don't always need that
type of like highlight it look so what
I'm going to do today and I'm just
trying to make it a little bit easier on
myself this is like not it's not like
super hard to blend out but it's not not
my morphe g2 i'll say that
and I usually try to use my concealer to
like sharpen up and you sort of like eye
shadow or clean up any eyeshadow like
right here on the edge so I'm trying to
like do that as well and you just
pretend that my finger has grown
bristles you know no big deal I'm just
going to kind of run my fingers with the
concealer over places that maybe I would
normally do it at but I don't feel like
that looks too bad but also like no one
has been using setting powders that like
in the videos that I watched at least
because like how do you use your fingers
for a powder that seems hard although I
can't really use a bronzer or contour
because I went through all of my
bronzers and everything in there's
nothing cream base and so powder is just
like it's not really going to work but
again we're going for a more like
simpler face look a bit of a folder I
maybe so maybe this won't turn out
looking too crazy maybe it'll turn out
looking really crazy i don't know now i
wish i had some color pop bronzers up in
here so for blush I'm going to use
between the sheets from colour-pop it's
just a really nice pink and I don't
think ever in my life I have put on
blush with my finger this feels none of
this feels right like none of those
feels right oh but it's actually going
on my cheek I don't know if it's in a
good way or not but I mean hmm okay I
mean that's maybe not the worst thing
ever
ah feels weird when Casey and I were
first talking about doing the
collaboration and we're both kind of
like what should we do should we do on
makeup tutorial should we do something
fun we were like let's do something fun
and I just like popped on youtube and
type to make up challenges and I feel
like this is one of the first ones that
came up and I was like that's a great
idea and so I emailed casing she was
like yeah let's do it then I start
looking at videos and I was like oh this
might actually be a lot harder than I
then I thought it was going to be but
that's okay we're getting it how does my
blush like I feel like my blush never
shows up on camera and I keep adding it
and adding it and then my husband comes
home and like thinks I was auditioning
to be a clown or something so cool what
and like blush never shows up on camera
it's not my fault that I looked this way
I feel like that's gonna have to be
pretty good for blush yeah that doesn't
seem too terrible let's move on okay I'm
going to go back to my eyes and use this
Maybelline master precise skinny gel
pencil I have recently become obsessed
with this thing I absolutely love it so
I'm going to apply this in my waterline
smudge it just slightly to on the lower
lash line so instead of doing eyeliner
there risqueman smudge it you just
slightly still feel like my eye is just
like look different mascara I'm going to
come in with the Too Faced better than
sex mascara and just apply this I'm not
going to use false eyelashes I'm not
going to use false eyelashes I feel like
between using like my BB cream not using
any bronzer like I'm just feeling more
like casual if that makes any sense but
also i don't use false eyelashes every
single day and i feel like i've used him
quite a bit in my like recent real
makeup tutorials so it's gonna give my
lashes a bit of a break so that's i'm
going with the toothpaste better than
sex mascara because i feel like it's the
next best thing having false lashes for
highlight i'm going to come in with
puppy love from colour-pop it is
technically an eyeshadow shades that's
how it was like marketed and sold as but
I think it's a really beautiful
highlight and I didn't have a couple of
other highlighters it's like this
mary-lou manizer that I've been using
the mere four I frequently will use my
finger as a highlight um instead of a
brush but for some reason i've been
using so much color pop I was like it
I'll just keep it rolling and use puppy
love as a highlight and hopefully you
guys can tell but I think it makes a
pretty darn good highlight I'm going to
comment a couple times and really like
highlight the face because that's what I
feel like I do when I don't do like
heavy makeup or like in my simple eyes
and fall a space makeup tutorial like I
really focus on the highlight and those
situations because I feel like they can
just bring such an oomph to the face and
then we don't have on like a classic
foundation or a lot of bronzer a lot of
setting powders or you know blah blah
blah we can still have a really flawless
looking
face a bright face healthy glow and all
that good stuff so then for my lip I
want to keep it new because I feel like
a bolder look would kind of like wash
out my face a little bit so I'm just
going to come in with truffle tease and
this is from Maybelline it's one of my
favorite favorite lipsticks I reach for
it all the time just a really pretty
light brown nude
I think I did it I feel like I'm like
missing steps because I'm doing things
like how I would not normally do it like
I've seen people allow the no mirror
makeup challenge that people are like
forget what it is they're supposed to do
next because when you're thrown out of
your routine and like doing different
things it's like hard to remember what I
might have missed so hopefully this was
every thing to do that I could do so
crushes and this is the final result I
hope you guys enjoyed this video it was
definitely a little bit more difficult
than I thought it was going to be to
make I actually got really nervous when
I was thinking about this and the other
day and I was thinking like what shadows
I could use our what I like to do etc I
was like wait a second can I use
concealer because there's an applicator
brush and can i use mascara because you
have a wand and so that was when I
finally got on and started watching
other people's videos and seeing what
they were doing so I kind of like knew
what to do and making sure i wasn't
skipping too many steps or making sure I
wasn't like cheating at anyway but yeah
I think this is my first like challenge
that I've done on my youtube channel i
haven't done like the no mirror makeup
challenge i haven't done like the three
minute challenge is when I've seen going
around so I was a little bit nervous for
it but I'm really glad that I did it I'm
very excited that I got to collab with
