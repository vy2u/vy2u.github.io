today's video is finally going to be my
review on the new Urban Decay Naked heat
palette I've had my palette for just
over a week now I have been playing with
it creating different looks of it just
seeing what I think about the shadows
and trying to put a full review video
together so I think I have some good
feedback now that I can give on the
palette I will show a little tutorial of
how I created this I love with this
palette I'll also insert a few other
photos from throughout the week of the
different looks that I've created with
this palette I some swatches to show and
then I also have some comparison
swatches that I wanted to show as well
as pulled out a bunch of my palettes and
tries to find comparables to the shades
in here and then I will give my final
thoughts on what I think of the palettes
who I think it's good for and if I think
it is a worth it but if you would like
to see my review swatches tutorial on is
the new Urban Decay Naked keep palette
let's go ahead and get started so the
Urban Decay Naked palette has packaging
that makes it a little bit difficult for
me to show you what very similar to the
other naked palettes from Urban Decay
the only other Urban Decay Naked palette
that I own is the naked smoky packaging
layout and all of that is comparable to
the other Naked palette so inside you do
have a large mirror it does come with a
double under brush which I'll touch on
shortly and then you have your 12
different shades in a mixture of matte
and shimmer
obviously this is the Nikki heat palette
so it is a very monochromatic palette
with a lot of reds and mostly reds and
some Browns you know very much the
palette does have a theme The Naked heat
palette the palette is $54 I guess oh it
comes with twelve shades it does come
with a double and a brush and a mirror I
think no I know what Sephora
right now it is available at the Urban
Decay website Sephora and Ulta at the
time that I'm filming I will have any
links to it for sale down in my
description boxes so when I first saw
this pellet I was immediately really
drawn to it because I do love warm
shadows I love the resin here the Browns
the shimmer shades were calling out to
me it was just a palette that definitely
stuck out to me I did featured in a will
I buy it I'll have that little a diet
listed down below and
I think that I was really struggling
with was the price tight the $54 I
thought that was pretty expensive and
because I'm not like a urban decay
fanatic I'm not like a naked palette
collector I just wasn't sure $54 is
going to be a smart purchase for me the
Hyde Stearns building more the hype
startet building more and this is where
I was like okay I think I just need to
get it I also did get a ton of comments
from people requesting that I do a
review video and not really much a lot
to me that people watch my reviews and
you know take what I say and listen and
decide if they're going to make a
purchase off of them that really does
mean a lot to me when it did come to
Sephora not only was Sephora having
double points for their points program
but also I got a percent cash back at
eBay which I thought was a pretty good
deal because with Ebates it does kind of
knock the price down a little bit you
end up getting cash regulators so I
thought you know what I'm going to go
ahead and do it I'm going to go ahead
and give it a try when I first got it
again the packaging I really like is
very sturdy when I open it up I do enjoy
the mirror I will say for the brush it
comes with this double ended brush so on
the one side we have a little bit more
of a dense brush I don't know if this is
supposed to be like a blending brush or
more of like a pencil brush it's kind of
like an in-between and on the other side
we have more of like a fluffy flat
shader brush and honestly I do not like
the brush at all I tried it again today
and I just feel like you can tell that
my shadows are not as blended as they
could be if I was using like an actual
blending brush and I felt like I had to
go in over and over and over with the
flat shader side to really build up the
color on my lids I have tried with every
ilex that I've done I've tried to use
this brush and make it work and at first
I thought I just need to kind of like
beat up on the brush you know like kind
of beat it up shows who's boss maybe I
was like be able to like loosen it or
something but no the brush is like a big
no-go for me so then we have our shape
in here so I'm just going to jump right
into what I think of the shades some
photos that I can insert the finger
swatches on top and then the brush
swatch is on the bottom I can also pull
out a couple here and I'll show you on
camera what I think of them and if then
I do have some comparison swatches that
I will be showing coming up here but so
starting from this side
we have ounce it when I first looked at
it I thought it was a matte shade but it
definitely does have a little bit of
shimmer to it it's not white white it's
more of a creamy peachy white almost
basically the only thing that I use that
for is to either set my primer because
it is such a subtle shimmer it's not
like I'm just putting shimmer all over
my eyes and then I will do it for the
brow bone and inner corner which is what
I have today and then we have chaser
it's just such a light light brown like
it just this shade is not wearable for
me the next step in the palette we have
soft and low blow both the pretty
typical transition Brown crease shades I
do like both of these shades but again
there's nothing super similar to each
other because soft and then low blow so
blow just has a little bit more of into
it it's a little bit of a deeper Brown a
bit of a warmer Brown I also appreciate
getting the basic matte Brown transition
shades because sometimes palettes we
don't have that and I really needed to
complete an eye look I know a lot of
other people do and then going into
lumber this was a really interesting
shade to me for this swatch on my hand
again there will be swatch photos and
sort of here also but this is one when i
swatched it on my finger it was very
very dry and I was kind of concerned but
it ended up being one of my more
favorite shades in the palette because
it's a really pretty kind of like pinky
peach almost like a duochrome shift to
it it's really really beautiful and I
will say I didn't love the way it's
washed I didn't love the way it felt
swatched on my hand but on the eyes I
thought it worked out very well what I
will say for every single shimmer shade
in this palette is that you have to use
some sort of setting spray with a fix
plus just some sort of liquid
otherwise the shimmers barely show up
and lumber was no exception it just it
just doesn't have enough room on its own
without some sort of liquid and that was
for every shimmer shade in here which I
was pretty disappointed at I thought at
least some of the shades would be able
to show up on the eyes good enough like
they swatch fine but on the eyes if they
need help my dental is a really pretty
like reddish brown I really do like that
shade as
and then moving into dirty talk and
scorched here they are slush on my hand
I mean from the swatches you can tell
that they are a little bit different a
little bit more orange a little bit more
red but they are very very similar and
even on the eyes they are super similar
so those two were actually a little bit
disappointing to me and again you do
need some sort of setting spray to get
it to really show up and moving on to a
few of the maps that we have in here we
have cayenne which is a really nice deep
brown shade I do really like that one a
lot and then we have el fuego which is a
nice like reddish brown shade it is what
I have all over my eyes and then ashes
which is kind of a deep purple here and
then ember which is a was a really
interesting chase you may think I was a
pallet this was like my favorite one
here it is right here I did wear this
the other day this is what I'm wearing
in my 20 K giveaway if you haven't
checked it out my 20k giveaway is live
and I'm wearing Ember all over my lid I
also am it giving giving away I did my
Kiki palette in that video so that well
of course will be linked down below but
I really did like that shade a lot and I
found it to be one of the more like
unique shades out of the palette so
overall with a few of swatches of my
hands and then the swatches that I
inserted in here kind of my overall
thoughts on the shades and how they
performed on the eyes again not swatch
because I feel like you cannot judge a
palette based on swatches that's why
when I'm reviewing palettes of what I
did with a Jaclyn hill palette I took a
while I created different eyelids I
tried to use every shade out of the
palette so I can explain in my review
how they perform on the eyes because
that's all that matters
actually putting these on my eyes I have
to say I was disappointed honestly I
really was it was not quite what I was
expecting I was pretty taken off-guard
that I had to use some sort of liquid
with every single shimmer shade I just
didn't see that coming
I mean there's definitely shimmer shades
where you use a liquid to make a more
metallic or give them more of an OOP but
that you don't have to in order for them
to show up and just I really struggled
with the shimmers which was really
disappointing to me it's one thing as I
was going through and creating different
looks with this palette I felt like I
was creating the
same look over and over when I went in
with today's look honestly when I sat
down to fill my look I had no
inspiration my guy had nothing nothing
was like screaming my name
I just wasn't inspired to pick up the
palette and I feel really bad saying
that but it is the truth I've heard
people say that they feel like the
shades just kind of blend together and I
agree with that
especially when you have shades like
dirty talk and scorch that look
different in the pan they look different
swatch but when you actually put them on
their eyes they're basically the same
thing and say just with all the looks
that I've come up with this week I've
just been pretty underwhelmed and on top
of that I was using the brush that came
with this palette which I don't think is
a good brush at all when I was doing
other looks or I was actually going to
be going out and about I had to bring
other brushes to help blend the shadows
and even still I don't really feel like
they blended all that miraculously like
I just I feel like I have better shadows
so those are the swatches and my
feedback on the shades I'm bummed I I'm
really bummed to say that I'm bummed to
say that the palette hasn't been working
out for me the best because I was really
excited for it also as I was going
through it all I could keep thinking
when I looked at the palette and was
actually putting the shadows on my eyes
was I have to have a dupe for that I
have to have to do that and I know a lot
of people said am i will i buy it video
you know the people that were saying
don't get to make it heat they were
saying you have so many comparable
shadows and so in my mind I kept saying
oh I think this is comparable I think
this is comparable but I was like you
know what I actually want to go ahead
and see so I want to show some
comparable dupes for the shades that are
in here before I go into my final
thoughts so I want to show you guys what
I have in my collection and meet you
know maybe if you have some of these
similar palettes or you all palettes
that I have you know maybe you can save
your money on the $54 and use what you
have in your collection already but when
I go ahead and jump into some
comparables and I'll show you some
swatches to do comparables of every
single shade again like the first four
shades the first two don't really do
anything for me the next two are your
brown transitions which I'm just going
to pull out the shape that we're a
little bit more unique to me or what I
use to my thought right
like oh wait I haven't do for this one
shade that I've done right away was this
lumber because it has like the pinky
peach type of feel to it so what I
thought would be similar to it was from
the new BH Cosmetics and Carli bybel the
deluxe edition palette when I use that
shade I immediately thought if this last
shade here in the palette okay so this
is lumber from the Urban Decay palette
and this is from the Carli bybel and BH
Cosmetics palette you can see that they
are super super similar feel very
similar in texture as well but I will
say with the karlie one you don't have
to use a liquid on it it shows up really
nice by itself and you need it with the
Urban Decay so the curly one is actually
a little bit butter and this entire
palette for all of the eye shadows and
highlights in here is 2250 so one
Taliban I kept coming back to when I was
thinking about dupes was the new jaclyn
hill and morphe brushes the palette that
Jaclyn hell did with them as I was going
to tell it I kept thinking oh I can find
shades in the Jackalope palette and I
don't want to do all shades as a jack
and pilot because I know that so about
very quickly not everyone got it so I
did pull out some other palettes as well
but there are some shades in here but I
just thought were extremely extremely
similar so next I wanted to show key
double which is this really nice warm
brown red comes the Jacqueline palette
I'm going upstairs compare it to Jax
which is right here
okay so here are the two the first one
is the urban decay and the next one is
the Jaclyn and morphe again extremely
extremely similar shades Roxanne from
the morphe palette was immediately one
of my first favorites so the first time
I used P Double it went my mind went to
with the smoky palette because these
shades are extremely similar I picked up
a dirty talk from the Urban Decay
palette and it immediately reminded me
again from the jquan morphe palette it
reminded me of firework so here are
those two swosh together on the top is
urban decay and on the bottom is Jaclyn
hill and from urban decay going into el
fuego and then once again coming back to
with the Jaclyn hill palette and picking
up the
Ajax which is right here so here we have
the urban decay and then the Jacqueline
hell again just super super similar I
know these pallets released around the
same time so if you were able to get the
Jasmine Hill pilot you might not need
the urban decay another pallet that I
was able to find is Dupin is the
Anastacio modern Renaissance
so he doubled which is right in the
center and it comparing that to red
ochre in the Anastacio pallet of urban
decay on the top and then anastacio on
the bottom again very very similar
shades and I know a lot of people on the
modern renaissance because it's been a
super hyped up pallet so you might be
able to find some dips in here as well
then I thought there was some comparable
dupes in the violet Voss Holy Grail
pellet I was trying to see if I could
find a dupe for ember which ember was a
little bit hard to find a dupe for and
again I do really like that shade out of
the palette but I thought it was a bit
close to bat my eyes from the violet
Voss palette so there are those two
smart shot next to each other you can
see the one from the urban decay is a
bit of a deeper brown but they are
pretty similar in shade but again ever
was one I can't find an exact dupe for
so if anybody has one you can let me
know but I thought that violet Laughlin
it was pretty similar to it so those are
a few comparable shades to eyeshadow
palettes that I have in my collection
that Emily will say it did remind me a
lot of the Jaclyn hill palette and you
know if you saw my wilayat video I was
kind of waiting back and forth if I
should get both pallets because I didn't
think they were similar I'll just run
through my tutorial really quickly
because I didn't use a ton of shades in
this particular tutorial what I did
first is I came in with low blow and I
put this into my crease and then I put
elf wiggle all over my lid shade I just
kind of wanted to do something a bit
darker at not the super smoky eye but
just a bit darker and to mix it up and
again I just I really haven't been
loving on the shimmers so I wanted to do
more of a matte look and then that is
all I did and just blend the two
together as best I could using the brush
that came with this palette and then
my lower lashline I put a little bit of
low blow and Cayenne together I didn't
want to bring the reddish tones onto my
lower lashline as well so that is why I
stuck with adjust the Browns for the
lower lashline and then I just have on
some pure lashes in the style of flirt
and that's all I did for my eye look
today but I'll have the little clip
inserted here me actually applying the
shade so you can see how they apply on
my eyes I will also have an Instagram
tutorial going up it'll probably go up
tonight on my Instagram so if you want
to check it out over there on March
Beauty word and I will show another look
using the Urban Decay make it heat
palette so you can see how they actually
do apply to my eyes but after sharing
the swatches some comparables and then
my tutorial I would love to wrap this up
with my final thoughts okay so my final
thoughts on the Urban Decay Naked
palette was that it did under well me to
be honest I guess I was maybe just
expecting a little bit more I definitely
was caught off-guard having to use a
liquid for the shimmer shades the match
didn't blend out as well as I thought
maybe they would and just for $64 like I
have better eyeshadow palettes in my
collection than this one I do want to
say that what that said I don't feel
like this was a terrible palette you
don't need to come off as bashing it
didn't feel like the formula and the
pigmentation of the shadows were as good
as I thought it was going to be but if
you don't have a lot of shades like this
in your collection you don't have a lot
of teloth like this in your collection
but this is what you really love I think
it's a decent eyeshadow palette but I
still wouldn't pay $54 for it to be
honest either use like if you get a 20%
coupon at Ulta that applies to the
prestige brand use it on this or you
know maybe wait for the vib sale but I
don't feel like it's worth $54 in my
honest opinion the shades inside were
just either not pigmented enough you had
to use a liquid or they were too similar
to one another in the palette not even
similar to other eyeshadow palettes but
they were too similar to one another in
the palette and when you only have 12
shades to work with that was a little
bit disappointing unfortunately this is
more of a negative review and I'm super
bummed about it I gave this palette my
all I tried probably 5 or 6 different
looks
the past week with this and I was really
trying I really wanted to make it work
but unfortunately at this time I think
I'm actually going to be returning my
palette just because of how many pellets
I have in my eyeshadow collection I just
don't feel like I really need this one
I'm just you guys know that I've been
trying to save up for a Natasha to nona
palette and this is what like almost
half the price of one of her palettes
and I've been wanting so you know why
would I hold on to $54 when I could put
it back into something else that I would
like to try so let me know in the
comments down below though what you
thought of it do you guys have it you
absolutely love it I know I've been
talking to a lot of you on snapchat
you've been showing me the look that
you're making and a lot of you seem to
really enjoy it which is fantastic like
that's great let us know some of your
favorite shades down below let us know
how you use them I would love to know
your comments too because again I don't
think this palette is not for anybody
and but I also don't think the palette
is for everybody you know if that makes
sense but again this is just my opinion
and my review but I appreciate that
people care about my feedback and care
about what I think about the palette so
I really want it to go as in-depth as
they could and especially to show some
of those comparable swatches to kind of
show why you know maybe it doesn't make
the most sense for me to keep around in
my collection but again let us know in
the comments what worked for you about
this palette what didn't work for you if
anything didn't work out for you or if
you're still considering picking up the
palette again I'll have it linked down
below if anyone is still interested in
getting it but I'd love to know your
guys's feedback so much because I'm very
curious to hear your thoughts on the
palette if you guys did enjoy it or find
it helpful please make sure to give me a
thumbs up that really does help me out I
hope that you will also consider
subscribing the phrase oh and I'll catch
you guys real soon in my next one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
