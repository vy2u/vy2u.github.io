today's video is going to be my November
favorites so crazy whoa but first before
we get into it if you're new to my
channel welcome my name is Samantha I
post videos about four or five times a
week so I hope that you will hit the
subscribe button so you are informed
when I post all of my videos but so
today's video is my November favorites I
have no unfavorites this month which is
great i love when that happens but i
have a lot of favorites to go over quite
a few random ones too so maybe we'll
start with the random ones and then move
into makeup and beauty but it's crazy to
think that it's almost the end of the
year like not even that like the
holidays are approaching because like
that's already been weirding me out but
it's weird now to think that it's almost
2017 and we would start thinking about
new years it's so crazy whoa so crazy
but I could probably talk about that for
a while but why don't we go ahead and
happen to what I've been loving on in
the month of November okay so like I
said I have some random ones to throw at
you but the first ones I want to talk
about our when I wear every single day
is my slippers I got these slippers from
target and I cannot stop wearing them I
mean they're just like regular old
slippers but like legit I get out of bed
and put my slippers on I get out of
shower and put my slippers on I wear
them up until I go to sleep they're just
so comfy i mean i don't know they were
super super affordable I don't know what
brand they are I just got a mad target
i'll try to link them down below if i
can just think they are super
comfortable they don't like make my feet
super like hotter sticky our pet
slippers in the past that did that and
they've also held up really well I've
had these for almost the entire month
and they still are holding up just fine
because I've also had slippers in the
past that like kind of just like started
to disintegrate as soon as you start to
wear them but these I'm just absolutely
digging but i thought i would let you
guys know if you're in cold weather
stays like me get yourself some slippers
makes a big difference the next one i
have is like so super random but hear me
out it's an app and no this video is not
sponsored this app doesn't know i'm
talking about them anything along those
lines but I've just been having so much
one with it that I wanted to share with
you guys my friend Shannon introduced it
to me it's called hydrol coach so you
can see it up here but basically it's
just an app to help you gauge like your
water intake and I just think that's a
fabulous idea i Shanna is always
training for like something she's doing
something fitness-wise like I think I do
a pretty good job of like keeping up
with like a fitness routine and like
kind of watching what I eat but like she
takes it to a new level and she teaches
me things so when she started talking
about this app I was like I need to
download that app do you just enter like
your height and your weight and male
female and that sort of thing and it
tells you like your target amount of
ounces that you should drink or water
throughout the day and then it'll kind
of break it up and like every couple of
hours you get a notification that's like
hey drink water hey and then when you
drink glasses they have like different
sizes and they're like so this is what
mine looks like and then you would just
click on it and then you have your
different sizes that you can say that
you you know drink that size of water
and then it kind of like counts it down
for you here as well it's almost like a
game and that's like what's made it fun
for me because I really struggled
drinking water when I actually worked at
the hospital I did a much better job
because I would like bring in my big cup
every day and like refill it and that
would be like my break time would be
like go walk to the farthest drinking
fountain ever to fill up my water cup
but working from home iced I really do
struggle to drink a lot of water i'm
really only drinking it when i'm going
to eat my breakfast or eat my lunch
because i don't like having my water
glasses or anything next to my computer
because i have a dog who jumps on my
chair every single day and i'm afraid
that she you know is somehow could enact
the water cup over and like spill it on
my laptop so having this app really has
made it like a game for me and it's been
a lot of fun and it's like to the point
where like when i when i make it all the
way like one day I just drink a ton of
water I don't know what it was I was
doing but there was like a little
graphic that popped up and it was like a
fish was like a snorkel on and like that
app was proud of me and I was like I'm
proud of me so I had to send it to
Shannon and I was like look what I did
so cool I don't know it's so silly I
know it's totally random but I
I won't share it with you guys because
legit it's been so fun and my husband's
like stop talking about hydro coach
that's all I hear about all day I'm like
I need to drink another four ounces so
like BRB I don't know I just think it's
a lot of fun again the app is called
hydro coach if I can find it i'll link
it down below there's nothing like
referral lives here people I'm just
simply letting you know I just thought
it was a lot of fun so that's my other
little random favorite for the month of
November okay so I have some hair care
that I want to talk about and quite
honestly I have meant to mention these
hair products for a while now i got
these sent to me from Influenster i
think it was in the summer and I just
fell in love with them right away but
they're from l'oreal and it is the
extraordinary oil nourishing shampoo and
then the extraordinary oil nourishing
conditioner these products are bomb and
I typically have a couple different you
know types of shampoos and conditioners
in my shower I have like this is
nourishing i think i have hydrating I
have what's the other one called you
know you have different like shampoos
and conditioners for different things
and you kind of switch it up throughout
I don't know anyone else do that that's
what I do but the thing about these that
I've realized like hey you really should
be talking about the more and like put
them in a favorites video is that I just
constantly reach for just these like the
other shampoos and conditioners in my
shower are like hey we're in here to do
you know appreciate me anymore and I'm
like I can't help it I just keep
reaching for these but what i've really
noticed about this is not only does it
make my hair soft which i think is great
it also makes it shiny which i think is
really nice but my hair I don't know
quite how I would explain it but it just
feels better it feels better to the
touch I think it looks better it helps
reduce frizz which is a big problem I
have with my hair is I have very frizzy
hair and I don't know between like the
combination of all of those different
things let's pray is more manageable
more shine it feels better it feels
softer I've just been so happy with
these so I don't know I tend to try to
buy more expensive shampoos and
conditioners because I've always been
kind of told like you're getting what
you pay for by the more inexpensive
products you know they probably won't do
the best for your hair so like in March
arrived like the more expensive shampoos
and conditioners but honestly I find
myself reaching for these I'm going to
be really sad when I run out of these
they're about halfway gone now but it's
to the point where I have to remind
myself like you've used these the last
three times like maybe you something
else in your shower but I just love them
so from l'oreal the extraordinary oil
nourishing shampoo and conditioner but
also have a nail polish i want to talk
about it's actually the polish that i'm
wearing right now it's from the sally
hansen at miracle gel line and it is in
it totally yours so again it's the color
i have on my nails right now I'm so
obsessed with this color so i love the
sally hansen miracle gel line i highly
recommend them so i recently started
giving acrylics put on but what I do
because I'd like to change my nail color
and I have a ton of nail polishes so
when I was going to the salon and then I
was getting dish lacked manicure not
only was I paying an extra like 20-25
dollars for the shellac manicure but
then I would feel bad like painting over
it a few days later cuz I'm like I
literally just paid an extra 20 bucks to
have them put this nail polish on me and
I sat in the chair longer so why am I
going to paint over it so what I've
started doing the last two times that
I've gotten my nails filled is I just
have them do the fill their and then I
come home and paint them and then every
like four to five days I tried to change
up the color and switch it up because a
lot of times I'm taking product photos
like with my hands I just think it kind
of looks like redonda in on instagram if
i have the same nail polish in every
single product photo I know like because
are the things that I think about but I
have to get it's like what the shampoo
and conditioner I have to remind myself
to not just keep reaching for this color
but I've been really good the last two
polishes that I've had one was more like
a burnt or dish color and then I think I
did like a light blue and I was like
okay it's time I can go back to this one
now right it's just such a beautiful
like nude brown color like this is how I
like my lipstick and this is how I like
my nail polish I just think it's a
gorgeous color again it's totally yours
from the sally hansen at miracle gel
line love this line I have so many
different polishes from it works great
for regular nails it works great on
acrylics it works great it's just one of
my favorites so whenever I see them like
on cartwheel at Target or something or
if there's a sale like CVS I try to pick
more up because I feel
you can't get enough of this line and
totally yours is a bomb nude brown shade
okay and then I have some skincare items
to talk about as well one that I want to
touch on is these masks from SNP so they
are sheet masks so they are super fun as
in peace sent me like 10 different masks
and I was so excited because i love
sheet masks these are so fun because
each one has a different animal on them
they also do a different thing but they
also look like a different animal I will
leave a video link down below I have the
panda one on my Instagram so when you
put on the mask it's like you know it
has that type of animal on it it's just
funny something to make you laugh so
each one does a different thing like for
example I just grabbed out the lion one
it says it recharges exhaust at skin
with a vital energy to give it a vital
glow and then the adder is an aqua mask
and it says aqua moisture master
rainforest moisture retention of dry and
water insufficient skin with aqua energy
creating moist and silky skin so each
one can you know did a different thing
I've tried three different masks now and
i have been super impressed with all of
them the first one that i tried was the
panda mask and I was like whoa that was
one where I woke up the next morning and
thought I still had makeup on my skin I
used it in the morning before I was gone
the whole day we were gone the whole day
the whole night was just a long day i
knew i was going to be gone full time so
i thought like why not give my skin and
extra boost and we stayed out very late
and i woke up the next morning and
looked in the mirror and thought I
didn't take my makeup off last night
like that so Chris I always take my
makeup off before I go to bed that was
how good my skin looked and I was
completely shocked I'm not gonna lie so
I have just been so impressed with them
and then I've used to other ones as well
I've used the rabbit one and I can't
think the other one that I use but i
remember i use the rabbit one for sure
as well and again they just make a
difference in your skin and they're so
often where we use skin care and we're
like yeah it's doing something right and
these you actually see the difference
right away that doesn't happen a lot in
skincare when it does happen like you
have to hold onto those products so i
was so excited I definitely wanted to be
able to mention these these can be found
at Ulta so I will leave them a link down
below then
you to SMP for sending me these again
this video is not sponsored but I just
had to mention them because I was so so
impressed with them I've talked about it
on Instagram I talked about it on
snapchat as well but i wanted to mention
it here in my favorite videos so the SNP
animal sheet masks are good ones the
more skin care is from juice beauty now
I did just do a video all on a juice
beauty set that i purchased so i will
leave that linked down below but in the
video I talked about the green apple
peel the full strength peel and I said
that this was definitely a standout
product in the set this peel is another
product that I felt after i used it i
could tell a noticeable difference in my
skin this was one that I used on a
Sunday evening and the next day when I
woke up when I looked at my skin it
didn't look like I said like foundation
and flawless face on like I did with the
face mask but to me the word that I
would use to describe it is my skin look
more youthful and I was like whoa let's
back up a second why is my face look so
good and I think it's because of the
peel I've been using this now I've used
it 4 times in 4 weeks with appeal I like
to use it once a week because it you
know is doing a lot to your skin it's
not something that you typically would
use on a daily basis so I've used it now
for four weeks and I've just been super
impressed with it the juice beauty set I
do a whole snatch it or scratch it in my
video but I mentioned that this was like
the standout product from the set and it
definitely is I would love to get the
full size of this when I run out of this
I got the juice beauty set at Alta so
again I can leave the set list it down
below but I will also leave this
individually down below because I don't
I've really never found appeal like an
at-home peel that I would like to do
myself until I discovered this one from
juice beauty so this one is a good one
but something else I want to talk about
is from vs spa this is a face
moisturizer but it is a gradually
tanning face moisturizer now i just have
a little guy right here i think it came
in like a beautycon box but i also have
the full size it's just upstairs in my
bathroom i forgot to grab it but like i
said i got this in my beauty come box
tonight said something on Instagram
about it because I was so excited for it
and vs bots actually contacted me and
they sent me
package and I did do a haul of that in
my latest PR haul video so i can leave
that link down below if you want to see
all the items that i got from vs spa but
i definitely asked for the full size of
this because this product is so good
when i first started using it it took me
two days and i noticed at that my face
was looking Tanner and I was like I need
to use this every single day I've just
been super super happy with it and they
also sent me like body tanning stuff as
well I've only used it twice so far but
it was so funny because actually just
today as I was changing my shirt in the
morning I looked at it like my stomach
and I was like whew color it's not just
wipe down there how exciting so I was
excited to see that the tanning is
working as well but this especially with
the face and it's just amazing and not
only is it you know tanning for your
face but it is also a moisturizer and I
love moisturizing my skin brain algae
infused it rejuvenate skin and gives you
a beautiful tan and you used daily to
restore skin and develop a glow I
definitely agree with that again I will
leave this link down below as well I've
just become obsessed with this from vs
bah so this next item isn't new to me
but I thought this would be a perfect
time to mention in a favorites video
because I know it has been mentioned in
a favorites video in the past but it's
from when wild it's their mega globe
contouring palette and this happened to
mine I was so sad we did some traveling
and when we came home it was completely
shattered and I was like no and it was
so crazy because this has come
everywhere with me like I always travel
with this and it's never broken I don't
know what happened i don't i have no i
don't know what happened i don't know if
my makeup bag got dropped like I
seriously don't know what happened and I
was just devastated but I went out and
bought myself a new one I was like nope
I have to have this I love this palette
so i thought i would share that with you
because that's how you know like you
really love something if you run out of
it or if it happens to break and you
immediately go out and purchase a new
one like that's when you know that you
really love something they do have two
different shades in the contouring
palette i get mine in Dolce de leche I
particularly love the setting powder
side
not only do I think it works good as a
setting powder but it also is like a
brightener for my under eyes which I
absolutely love it just helps me look
more awake instantly but the contour
site is also very very good like at
first I just kept using this side and
when I finally use the contour side I
was like why have I not been using that
it works great it's just it's so pretty
and especially for a drugstore option
it's so affordable and just bomb you're
getting two different products it's big
I mean I just I really hope this doesn't
break on me again cuz I was like
devastated when I opened my makeup bag
and saw that this was completely
shattered but yeah I definitely had to
go out and get me a new one okay then I
just have one more favorite it is from
Real Techniques and it is the diamond
beauty sponge oh I love love love this
little guy I did do a full video on the
sponge if you want to see it i will
leave it linked down below but i have
been loving this this fun just like a
dream come true to me and i like the
Real Techniques sponge the orange one I
like it just fine I like the Beauty
Blender much more and this is right up
there if not even better than the Beauty
Blender in my opinion and it's half the
price of a Beauty Blender and believe
these are either 999 or 1099 on Alta I
will leave on link down below as well
it's amazing it blends so well so
obviously it's not wet so it does get
even bigger than this I can tell with
all of these different like sides and
ridges and grooves men's a little dirty
because I just used it and I tried to
give it a quick rinse before put it in
the video but with all the different
sides to this you can do your entire
face and like sometimes with the beauty
blender or the Real Techniques sponge
like as I'm going through so I do all of
my foundation and then I do all of my
concealer and then by the time I go to
blend out the contour I'm like oh gosh
my spine just completely dirty like is
this actually doing anything am I do I
need to go wash the sponge before i
continue my face and because of how big
this is and all the different sides to
it you can do your full face and it's
just amazing influence so well i have
been loving this especially for the
price like this is one to stock up on do
not miss this one so if you haven't
tried the Real Techniques diamond spongy
it I definitely suggest you do alright
guys that is going to be it for my
November favorites I really hope that
you guys enjoyed this video and seeing
what I have been loving on for the month
