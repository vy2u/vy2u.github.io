is going to be a book haul so I'm just
going to be sharing all the books that I
have recently received from authors or
publicist to review on a chiclet plus
i'm going to be fighting the elements
outside because i'm filming way later
than i normally film and the sun is
rapidly going down and when the Sun
starts to go down it goes down fast also
my husband is working in the basement so
I hope you can't hear any like music or
loud pounding but if you do we're
finishing the basement it's really fun
but if you'd like to see the books that
I have received to review on chocolate
plus please keep watching ok the first
1i have is guarded and this is by angela
ocurro and i'm very excited for this one
because stay tuned on chocolate plus
because i actually have a giveaway to go
along with this and if you watched my
snapchat you will know what that
giveaway is because i just opened that
package out too long ago because they
said sent me the products as well that
you guys were receiving in the giveaway
and they're kind of like like bath and
body type products but I'm very excited
for that so that will be in correlation
with my review of guarded as well looks
like we followed New York City flight
attendant up former New York City flight
attendant Andy Taylor she's adjusting to
farm life when her grandmother considers
tearing down the old stone house she has
a boyfriend who is no longer with his
corporate life and Cincinnati looks like
there's going to be some some issues
there with her man of course and annie
is trying to save the house and she
finds letters were in during World War
Two that revealed a family mystery and
even an Italian connection so that is
what really got me interested in the
book because I love kind of like real
paths and then present and combine them
together and of course they give away so
watch out for that one okay the next one
I have is the new mrs. D and this is by
heather hill really excited to read this
one because i just thought the cover was
super funny um so it says four days into
their honeymoon and Greece Bernice and
David dando have yet to consummate the
marriage
and have accepted his almost
non-existent desire for sex throughout
the relationship oh dear Bernice finally
discovers the reason he is addicted to
porn learning that the love of her life
chooses the cheap thrill of fantasy over
her is devastating but then every man
does it it's just looking right if she
relieves if she leaves the relationship
because of virtual adultery will she be
labeled as pathological overreacting or
even worse frigid oh okay so that's a
lot going on that's more than I thought
was going to go on but very interested
about this one and I just love the cover
I thought that was cute okay the next
one I have is 30 days to 30 and this is
by Courtney I don't know if the P is
silent Courtney's sack pizza Courtney
okay now sure on that one let's see it
says what if you were on the cusp of
marrying the guy of your dreams and
reaching that career goal you set for
yourself only afraid I'll to be taken
away in one fell swoop and one of this
all happened a month before you turn 30
this is the story of gel Stevens who
after moving back home finds a list she
made in high school of 30 things she
wanted to accomplish before her 30th
birthday and then she has month left to
team up with old friends and accomplish
as much as she can before the big 30
kind of curious to read that because I'm
28 so I like to read those types of
books and I'm curious what she has on
her list that she wants to complete
before 30 so i have is community affairs
and this is by michelle lynn siegfried
think freed this is in the jersey shore
mystery series it's book number 3
there's also red tape and tax cut i
haven't read either of those books yet
so i'll have to see if that impacts my
reading at all of this one but it says
it's a tale of kidnapping murder and
neighbors you'd like to kidnap and
murder that's kind of fun so we follow
Bonnie she's a sexy sassy Italian
princess living in New Jersey she's
loving life with a rich husband
beachfront living and a promotion at
work until a new neighbor Lila is
determined to destroy her happiness
Bonnie starts to suspect a connection
between her new neighbor and the
untimely death of a local resident and
she recruits her friend too
figure out if her suspicions are correct
as the very last line is a perfect read
for those who like laugh out loud humor
in their mysteries which I do that's how
I like my mysteries so I'm looking
forward to that one right the next one I
have is Dorothy Parker drank here this
is by Ellen Meister and let's see it
says the acid tongue to Dorothy Parker
is back and haunting the walls with her
piercing wit audacious voice and
unexpectantly tender wisdom heavenly
peace no thank you Dorothy Parker would
rather wander the famous halls of the
Allen I'll kweon hotel drink in hand
searching for someone anyone who will
keep her company on this side of
eternity it just sounds like a book I
want to read I like reading things like
that it sounds like a lot of fun so when
I got asked to read it I said yes and I
also like the cover immediately caught
my eye I really like the cover so that
is Dorothy Parker drink here ok so those
are all the books that I got in my most
recent haul I hope you enjoyed that
video that wasn't too many I have
recently got way too many books on my
reading list and I had to try to cut
back a lot especially with holidays
coming i'm participating in the National
Novel Writing Month nanowrimo so I'm
trying to write 50,000 words in the
month november so i tried to cut back as
much as i could on my reading list i am
happy to say that I'm just about to
clear 30,000 words and we're not even to
the half way point yet of November so
very excited I'm on track to get book
number 5 out in early 2016 if you guys
