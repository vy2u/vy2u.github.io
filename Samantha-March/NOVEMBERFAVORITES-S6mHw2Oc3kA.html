welcome to December this only another
favourites video this is going through
my beauty and lifestyle favorites for
the month of November so I have a few
makeup products to talk about that I was
loving last month and then also kind of
like just a little random thrown in
there of course but yeah so why don't we
just happen to my favorite okay so the
first one that I want to talk about is
this morphy it's the 35 t palette so
I'll open it up for you guys but this is
the 35 t palette so it's the 35 taupe
palette from morphe and i cannot even
tell you guys mine frame can you guys
see me I can't even tell you how many
times I have used this palette it is
getting so much love my Kat Von D shade
+ light eye palette is like hello over
here today I used makeup geek I'll
makeup geek for my eyeshadows because I
was like I can't even remember the last
time I busted into my little makeup geek
Z palette I'm like I'm so sorry so but
this one has just been so loved I have
done a full video review and swatches
and makeup tutorial with this palette
and then I also recently posted a
holiday makeup tutorial and it was for
all affordable products and so I used
this one as well and I went back and
forth like should I use it because i've
been using it so much and i already did
one make a tutorial with it but I mean
it's just what I have been obsessed with
I was going to try to point out some of
my favorite colors and then I was like I
don't even know like how to explain like
Thursday's really pretty like taupe
mauve shades down here that are gorgeous
this brown is really good this throne
was really good i like this shade I like
this brown this brown is like my
absolute fit out like I use it all of
the time I love this shade there's a
really pretty rose gold shade this is
the color that i use to my holiday
makeup tutorial these coppers and this
one so stunning I've used this shade and
fish
love those but I do have to say so I
mean basically I feel like I just listed
every single color but there was one
color I used just the other day and I
was like nothing's happening like I kept
putting more of my brush and putting it
on my eyes and then I was like it must
be the brushes fault and I got a new
brush and it's still it wasn't really
working out and now I'm trying to
remember which exact shade it was I
think it was this shade right here like
it just it didn't really work out for me
but yes the 35 t palette from morphe i'm
absolutely loving it i think they're
like $22 on the market website i will
leave it linked below love it another
product that i've been reaching for so
much i've had it in my collection for a
while and i believe i've talked about
this on maybe it was like my was it like
multi use makeup product video that i
talked about this but it's my l'oreal
true match foundation and this is if you
can like tell it's like super dark it is
in and the seven classic tan so it is a
very dark shade what i actually
purchased the for was for cream
contouring and i use it for cream
contouring i love to use it for cream
contouring i just find it so easy to use
but what i have recently been using this
for is to mix in with my foundation and
i demonstrated this in my holiday makeup
look but i have a couple of foundations
that just are too light for me and
instead of being like oh you know throw
those foundations why they're not going
to work what i do is take a darker color
and i just put a drop of this into that
foundation i mix it together I just use
my fingers to mix it together on the
back of my hand and then it's like I've
made my own shade and it matches me so
much better I I did that trick today I
used this plus my my Maybelline better
skin foundation I've talked about that
one a few times on my channel and I
actually got it sent to me to review and
so I kind of had to just guess the shade
before the product even launched and so
it was really hard to just like kind of
blindly guess and mine is just a little
bit too light but I really like the
foundation I like wearing it's very long
lasting so instead of just not being
able to use it or not
happy with the shade I just put just one
drop of this into it and it works out
really well I use it with my L'Oreal
True Match Lumi foundation to and just
I'm so happy with it i use this nearly
every single day my foundations another
product that i've been loving on is my
neutrogena body oil and i just did a
full video review on this so if you
haven't seen it i'll link it below and
i'll put it in a card up above but
basically so i will send this to review
as well in an influencer box and my
video when i talk about this I kind of
explained all about influenster I've
been getting the updates are like be
alerts that a lot of you guys are
setting up for influenster that's so
cool i'm so happy you guys are I think
you guys will really love it if you're
like a beauty blogger or vlogger start
of bloggers or blogger I think it's a
really cool thing to sign up for you get
some products to review so i was sent
this neutrogena body oil I have become
just obsessed with it I love using it I
love putting it on after the shower I
love putting it on just when I'm sitting
at home and I'm like you know I just
feel dry and icky because it's so like
cold here and I can tell like my skin is
like I need moisture so I just keep
using this and i love it i cannot even
believe like how little product it looks
like i have used because I feel like I
know I know I know I use it every single
day so I'm like how long is it going to
take me to go through this huge bottle
but I'm so happy about it so if you're
looking for a good body oil or you're
not happy with even like your lotion or
moisturizer for your body I would give
this a shot ok so I just have three lip
products that were favorites for my
month november the first one is clay
crush and it is from maybelline it is
from there Matt collection I believe I
mentioned this maybe in like my fala p
video and perhaps the hall as well but
that's what it looks like it's just a
beautiful nude shade it has a matte
finish to it which I really love so
there's a swatch of that it's a nude
shape it with like a little hint of like
brown to it and so I just love it I get
so many compliments whenever I wear it
or when I'm in a video and I'm wearing
it people are asking me what i'm wearing
a Mike Khloe crush I just I'm so
obsessed with it I love it it is not
what I'm wearing on my
today today i'm wearing i'm trying out i
just bought two of the NYX soft matte
lip creams i think they are i just
bought two shades i have london on my
lips today trying to map just bottom and
my other two are liquid lipsticks from
colour-pop the colors that i have been
loving RB / and trap so I will go ahead
and swatch these for you as well color
pop I I mean I feel like I'm color pops
like biggest fan girl because they just
I'm so so impressed with them I have so
much stuff in my cart right now it's
ridiculous i'm just like waiting for the
right moment to check out and then i saw
that they posted a where do they posted
I a new eye shadow and it's called like
puppy love it's the cutest thing you
guys should really go check it out it's
five dollars like all their eyeshadows
are and it's a it's a pearlized finish
it looks really like shimmery and
beautiful five dollars but all the
proceeds i'm pretty sure it said all of
the proceeds on the sale of that is
going to like a like a charity for for
puppies and they have the whole thing
explained on their website I think it
looks so cool but the little color pop
out like the little packaging it comes
in has like a little sparkly paw print
on it that one in my bag right away I've
been wanting I have like their I have
the liquid lipsticks obviously I have a
bunch of the lippie Stix and I have some
of the blushes but I actually don't have
any of the eyeshadows yet and I really
want to try them but I just got the Kat
Von D shade and light palette and then I
got the more view 35 t palette and I was
like do I really need more eye shadows
but I've been watching you know all the
holiday makeup tutorials are coming out
and so many people are using color pop
shadows and so I've just been like
making a list and writing down all the
shadows everyone is using and I gotta
get my son this one the first one is
trap and then the one right next to it
is beeper so to me they seem kind of
similar and as they're like as I first
put them on and they're wet I don't feel
like they look super similar and then
when they dry to their matte finish I do
think they look more similar but trap is
a little bit more unlike the mauve gray
side and beeper is just a little bit on
the deeper side and it's more like the
true mouth I think so just a little bit
deeper but both of these I get so many
compliments when I wear them I when I've
been wearing trap I literally had like a
stranger and target come up to me and
asked what my lipstick was and I was
like oh trap from colour-pop like it was
it was self on you but yes these two I
just get so many compliments on the
liquid lipsticks from colour-pop are
only six dollars which that is so
affordable I think every time I've
ordered with color pop I've gotten like
a five dollar coupon off for them so I
mean basically if you think about it
these are like a dollar if you use your
coupon for one you know what I'm saying
can't wait I just saw I'm trying to
think of how many of their liquid
lipsticks I have in my cart right now i
have like teeny tiny and there is the
one I know for sure platform is in there
I don't know you guys have to check out
the colour-pop website if you haven't
yet because they have some really great
things the last thing I have to share is
kind of a random thing but I'm just I'm
so excited about it and I do this every
year so I just want to share it with you
but what it is is basically just making
your own like personalized calendar so i
make mine on vistaprint and i got mine
on cyber monday and they were having
like a sixty percent off sale and so
these personalized calendars came out to
be seven dollars like okay so um it's a
full like 12 month calendar january to
december and you can just put your own
little picture here like this is a
picture of my dog can you guys see that
it's my favorite picture of her but yeah
you can go in you can put different
pictures on here you can put like
birthdays and any special events like I
have my cousin's birthday my friend's
birthday my birthday uh where is he my
husband's birthday my brother's birthday
March is a very big birthday month for
my family and my friends but I just
think this idea is so cute like I don't
know I just love it here's here's the
cheeky chicks you know just doing yoga I
mean I had to include us in our calendar
of course if you guys don't follow the
cheeky checks you should I have a yoga
Instagram account with my best
friend we do yoga we just sent eight
thousand followers on Instagram which is
super exciting but yeah there we are
again just being besties and stuff um
that's on st. Patty's Day you guys can't
tell um yeah I just think this idea is
so cute like for September I put a
picture of one of my wedding pictures up
because it's my wedding anniversary
month but yeah I just loved this idea
that of anyways but then if mr. print is
having any sort of good sales which I
feel like they always have a good sale
or coupon code or something like i said
i got mine for sixty percent off so it
was not even seven dollars I got my mom
one for Christmas too mom if you're
watching I think you already knows we
were talking on the phone that day but
you know your box is coming soon don't
worry think they are so great i also
have like a desktop one that i put on my
desk it's just like a smaller one I made
one of those two it ended up being four
dollars so yeah I get mine through
vistaprint I can leave the link below
but I just think they're such a cute
idea if you guys are still looking for
any like last-minute holiday ideas I
don't know if you'd be able to get it in
time but I'm using it as a gift to and I
just love doing these personalized
things I think there's no I actually
just finished filming the video and
realized i forgot to talk about some
more favorites i had as i was like oh i
didn't have a little R to show this
month I in my head I'm like dang I
really thought I had more and then I
went upstairs and I'm starting to like
like I washed my hands I washed my
swatches off and I was like I'm confused
I really thought I had something else to
talk about and I did also from
colour-pop these are their new gel
liners I just came out the gel cream
liners that they just launched a short
while ago and they were hiding under one
of my notebooks on my desk so I didn't
even see him so when I kept looking at
my desk they were hidden underneath the
notebook hello and I was like maybe it's
not that big of a deal like i can
include him in next month's but I'm like
no I'm wearing these all the time like I
have to show you guys my favorites so if
you watched my color pop hall which I
can put in the cards as well I actually
ordered these three in the liner form
and then I also ordered one in the pot I
really ended up not loving the one and
the paw
but these three liners I think are so
good I'm definitely getting more liners
they are in my there am i in my cart as
well along with all my other things
first shade is crybaby and it's this
beautiful like soft lavender I think it
is so stunning and all of these are so
creamy they glide on so easily that's
crybaby and then i also got maybe and
this is like a really unique green like
it's a light green but it's very vibrant
but that one is maybe and honestly these
are these stay in my waterline and even
on like my top lash line they stay i'm
pretty sure longer than any eyeliner
that i've owned I've been like battling
it out between the color pop and the
Knicks try sholay eyeliner for my
waterline and they're like neck-and-neck
and I think colour-pop might actually
beat it out but the last one I got is
best oh and it's a beautiful burgundy
shade so that one is best oh I love
wearing vests to-- on my top for my
eyeliner and making a cute little wing
with it i love it i get so many
compliments on these they stay so long i
don't have to worry about these budging
of course they're colour-pop they are
super affordable and I'm just so
impressed with them so I had to pop back
in here quick you guys about that is so
those are all of my beauty and lifestyle
favorites for November I don't feel like
I had a whole lot going on this month
but I really wanted to just pull like my
most favoritest things that I could tell
