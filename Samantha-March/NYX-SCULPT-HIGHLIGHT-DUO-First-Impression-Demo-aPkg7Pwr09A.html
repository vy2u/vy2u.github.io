today's video is going to be a first
impression and demo and it is gonna be
on the fairly new NYX sculpt and
highlight face duo so this is what the
product looks like these I believe are
fairly new they're not super super new
but I've actually had such a hard time
tracking these down and I ended up just
having to order it online at Ulta I
couldn't find it anywhere and the
drugstores at Target I couldn't even
find it at Ulta when I went there one
time but I finally just ordered it
online because I really wanted to try
these out so basically what it is is a
double-ended product one side has a
contour shade one side has a highlight
shade now I do not have anything for
cream contouring as of yet I only have
like powder contour shades and I really
wanted to pick something up so I would
have a cream contour in my collection
and then I saw this and I was like why
not give it a shot not sure about my
shade either I did think online they had
really good descriptions of like what
undertones you are you know maybe it
would be best with this one which I
thought was really helpful but I don't
know we'll see but the ones that I got
is almond and light so this is what the
product looks like so you have your
contour on this side and your highlight
on this side and I don't know we're
gonna see if it works I've never used
this before on my face I did show it I
believe in a haul and I took some
pictures with it but I've never actually
opened it up like opened this up and and
put it on my face so we will see I do
have like foundation on and obviously my
eyes are done but I don't have anything
else on my face I don't have concealer
blush anything like that be able to see
what this would look like and you know
of course a normal setting so we will
see a little bit more on this like I
said I ordered my from Ulta it was 1199
on here it says you get point 1 7 fluid
ounces on each side so the contour and
the highlights each have 1.7 fluid
ounces which doesn't seem like a super
lot to me but that's okay it says use
sculpt and highlight face duo for an
effortless transformation our liquid
formula has buildable coverage and will
blend
seamlessly for a flawless contour okay
so we'll go ahead and try it out so
let's hop into the demo okay so I'm
going to use the contour side first
here's what it looks like well I like to
start like at my ear and work my way
down so I'm just going to do one of
those make a line basically with
contouring you're wanting to create
shadows on your face willing to create
shadows on your face
to give like definition I'm gonna do
just a little bit up here by my forehead
and then I'm gonna see how it does on
the nose as well so I'm gonna make
little lines down my nose now that we're
lookin just a little bit crazy one thing
that I noticed is you don't really seem
to get a lot of product on the actual
like applicator I really should've
dipped back in and picked up more but
it's just one thing I noticed right away
I have a brand new Real Techniques
makeup sponge and I'm going to use that
and just blend it in and then when I
blend in a contour what I'm thinking
when I'm blending is blend up like blend
into your skin but blend up you never
want to blend the contour down because
then you're taking away the effect of
contouring so that blended extremely
easily like that was very very easy to
blend that was no problem at all and can
you see the shadow effect yeah you guys
can see that right you can see the
shadow effect here okay so let's try the
other side and I just like to use the
sponge to blend it out but you can also
use brushes of course it really just
depends on what it is that you want to
use this is really no problem like
sometimes I feel like I got I would get
a little bit
scared of like the cream contouring some
like will it blend as easily or am I
gonna have like weird looking lines on
my face like I would just be a little
bit unsure about it but that that is so
super easy so usually if I contour the
nose I just kind of like take my fingers
and blend it in you can use if you have
like a small brush you can use a small
brush but I typically just will use my
finger so we have everything blended in
for the contour honestly because it was
my first time using it I went pretty
light handed just because you know not
sure how it's gonna be and honestly I
think that I could have used more
product because of how little products I
got on the actual application I would
probably comment like two times on each
on each side of my face to do the
contour lines probably just one I
probably do one each for my forehead and
then the same just one for the nose but
I think this would be really good
because if you just want a light contour
you can go like hand it and you're still
gonna get a nice effect and I'm actually
going to come back in I'm gonna just do
one more swipe on each side of my face
just to see if we can build up the
product
as I did one more swipe each on the
cheeks and then I'll go ahead and blend
again and see how we do once again very
very easy to blend and yeah I think it's
looking looking like it's gonna be
pretty easy to build up gonna go in with
a light hand you sure Ken if you want to
go in a with a heavier hand or you come
into light and you want to build it up I
think that you'd be able to do that as
well I think it looks good I feel like
my shade actually looks good because
that's really what I was the most
concerned about but seriously that
blended out so easily that's what I was
worried about the cream contouring am I
gonna be able to blend am I gonna look
weird and I think it looks pretty darn
good let's move on to highlight so now
I'm gonna go in on the highlight side
and I'm going to put this underneath my
eyes middle of my forehead down the
bridge of my nose and keep its below and
on my chin so so right away I think this
shape might be a little bit darker than
I normally would do but not like super
super dark so basically what I think I
would use this shade for is like hiding
dark circles type of thing not really
for highlighting but we'll see what it
looks like when it's blended out so I
feel like I just did one swipe on the
under eyes and I felt like I had more
product on here than I did on the
contour side which really doesn't make
any sense but uh that's that was what I
found I'm just gonna do some in the
middle of my forehead this looks like a
very yellow very very yellow color and
then just on my chin I'm just gonna use
my same Real Techniques sponge on the
other side and blend this in there so
that actually is not about highlight
shade once I blended it in it definitely
does give a brighter effect to my under
eyes if you guys can tell I really do
think it gives a brighter effect which
is awesome so what I'm also going to do
with this is use it to sharpen up the
contour so I'm basically gonna take it
and go right underneath my contour shade
seems
on the other side now people do this
with highlight shades people do this
with like setting powders because
basically it just as if you took your
contour tool oh you can do this trick
and just sharpen everything back up so
I'm just gonna take my sponge again and
buff it in do you see how it gave like a
sharp look to the face now obviously we
don't want like you know super harsh
lines so I'm just gonna take my Real
Techniques brush this is a blush brush
but it's what I use to blend my makeup
I'm just gonna kind of run it along down
here so we still have that same effect
but it's not like super harsh you know
so I'll blended that in a little bit now
I'm gonna take my Rimmel stay matte
powder and my ELF small tapered brush
and I'm just gonna go ahead and set
where I put the highlight shade this
will help to avoid creasing this is also
where like if you want to bake you know
sometimes people will bake the under
eyes or are baked the like sharpened oak
right here people like to bake those too
I honestly am NOT a huge Baker myself
really in any sense of the word I'm not
a huge Baker I only do it when I need
like SuperDuper like a long-lasting
makeup and be since I'm gonna go play
volleyball in three hours today is not
one of those days but so this is what
the final effect is with both the
contour and the highlight shades on I
have to say I'm really impressed I'm
gonna hop off camera and finish the rest
of my face blush highlight you know all
that good stuff and you know kind of
examine myself a little bit closer in
the mirror so I can stop looking up at
the viewfinder because I know that's
annoying but I kind of want to look at a
little bit closer but right now my first
impression is really good which really
excites me if I just threw some blush on
real quick and kind of checked it out a
little bit closer in the mirror but so
far I am really really happy with this I
was nervous about it because of the
shades they don't have a huge shade
selection I would say they do have six
different shades and I was a little bit
nervous that I wasn't gonna get the
right one I think I got the second one
and I was kind of hoping there was one
in between the first and second but
honestly this worked out really well for
me again this one is almond and light so
for reference this is the one that I
picked up again I am very impressed with
how easily these blended outlets both
shades I thought blended out so well I
really like the contoured effect that
the contour side gives me again the
highlight at first I was a little bit
concerned because I thought maybe it was
gonna be too yellow and really only good
for covering dark circles but I thought
it also did brighten up my under-eye it
did set it with powder so far I have not
seen any creasing but again I've only
had it on for about 10 minutes so I
can't really speak to that as of yet I
did like the highlight shade too because
it was a thicker consistency but not
like type of thick because I don't like
putting something really really thick on
my under eyes I do like more lighter
when it comes to the concealer just
because you know the skin under your
under eyes is so like thin anyways to
put like something really thick on it
and then try to blend it out I think
it's really hard but I liked that it was
it had some oomph to it but not enough
to be suffocating and I also liked that
it wasn't light enough that I didn't
feel like it was doing anything does
that make sense it was kind of like
perfectly balanced in the middle from my
first impression again sometimes first
impressions can be hard because it
really is a first impression this is the
first time I'm putting on my face seeing
how it works seeing how it looks but my
first impression is actually a really
big thumbs up I got really really
excited using this product because again
I don't have anything for cream
contouring I think this is really cool
because it'll be nice to travel with
because you'll have your contour shade
and your highlight shade all right here
which i think is a really awesome so
that's good like I said it was 1199 I
got mine on the Ulta website but you
should be able to purchase these like in
drugstores at Ulta online things like
that they have six different shades but
I'm going to keep using this and keep
trying it out keep playing with it see
if there are pros or cons that I can get
because I do plan on filming a new and
beauty Fabri fail my first Fabri fail
video that I did was drugstore Edition
and this is going to be like new makeup
new and
beauty things like that so this is going
to be featured because it is like I said
fairly new and so I'll keep using it
trying to get the pros and cons so I can
