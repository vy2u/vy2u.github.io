are you today on today's video should
just be a quick one I have a new Vox box
that I received from Influenster that I
wanted to share with you guys and they
give my review of the product that I
received I think I have done one of
these before because the Maybelline
better Skin Foundation I received that
in the influenster voxbox so just real
quick if you're not familiar with
Influenster or their box boxes
I will leave more information in the
description box below but basically
influenced her is it's just influenced
or calm I believe I mean I'll have a
below for sure but basically if you are
an influencer like if you are a blogger
vlogger and up on this website and you
take a little like surveys and you
answer questions and you link all your
social media accounts so Influenster can
see what the items are that you're
interested in and then they can also see
like your range of social media so
basically like the higher presence you
have on social media the better chances
you have of receiving these box boxes
because there are some really cool ones
like on the Beauty side I mean I got a
full-size foundation of the Maybelline
better Skin Foundation you you get it
for free to leave reviews for the
products that you receive that's the
main thing that they're giving you
something to try out to test to give
your feedback for on influencer they
have like little things that you can do
on there to help like build up more
bonus points but that's basically what
influencer is again I'll leave the link
below if you guys want to check it out
if you weren't on there yet or for your
bloggers or you do a lot of reviews in
places I would definitely suggest
testing it out and seeing if it's a good
fit for you I have joined it I think
just for the last few months but I've
really enjoyed it I got an email just
this morning saying that I have another
box box on the way and this one looks
really cool like it has a plethora of
stuff in it
and I'm really excited to try everything
out so I'll be filming that video here
shortly via definitely if you are a
blogger a vlogger you do a lot of
reviews you're on social media etc I
definitely recommend checking out
influencer because it's a really cool
way to get new products and be able to
try out new products especially if
you're looking for you know new content
to put on your blog or your YouTube
channel this is a good way to be able to
find some more content for you guys but
if you'd like to see what I got in my
latest box box please kvetching so in my
box box I got the Neutrogena Vox box and
inside got the little card kind of
explaining what is all going on and then
the product itself which is the
Neutrogena sesame body oil it's oily coz
I've been using it so the bottle hooks
like to touch it it's oily so I'm like
oh oh Nelly
is what the product looks like so I mean
it's a full-size of the body oil from
Neutrogena it is called the sensual
moisturizer it says experience
Neutrogena body oil it's light sesame
formula glides on easily to moisturize
dry skin it's so sheer it vanishes into
shower damp skin leaving it soft and
silky with a radiant healthy glow no
moisturizer can touch this experience it
says that you can use an after shower or
bath while your skin is still damp you
smooth a few drops to help seal in the
moisture how do you dry naturally or
simply pat dry with a towel or if you
use it for the bath you can add a few
drops into your bath and it'll help
soften your skin while you are in there
so again that's what the product look
like I have been using this every single
day especially now that it's getting
colder I love oils but like look at that
it looks like I have not used anything
and I'm like wait what because I've been
using it for weeks I'm not kidding and
when you dump it out like it just pours
all over your hands so it's not like I'm
like trying to use a little amount at a
time so I can't believe it I feel like
it's gonna take me forever to go through
this so in there with the box box you
get a little card just kind of
explaining what it is so it just says
congratulations you've been selected to
test Neutrogena light sesame formula
body oil and goes on to you know
I've explained a little bit how to use
it on the back it just has some more
instructions on how to use it it says
you can use it in the back you can use
it for shaving in place of your favorite
shame shave cream you can use it as a
moisture treatment for elbows heels you
know any part of your body that's dry
you can also use it to soften your
cuticles which is a big thing that I use
oil for and then also on the card if
you're new to Influenster it'll have
like some directions down here for you
like once you get a voxbox you need to
go to your influencer account and check
in your box that way they know you have
it and then you have little activities
that you can do with all the campaign's
that I've done they have ways that you
can like tweet the companies that have
sent you in so tweet tweet Neutrogena
there's usually also some sort of
hashtag involved like this one the
hashtag is so sheer skin glows so we
when you get the influencer box
definitely you know you reviewing the
product you're talking about it you're
sharing on your social media on your
Instagram Twitter Facebook etc so yeah
that card kind of gives all the
explanation of it but that is basically
what the box looked like and then to
talk a little bit more about the product
I will say that I love oils alright I
love oils I think I've talked about oils
here on my channel before I use I mean
if you could look at my bathroom I use
oils specifically for your body I use
oils specifically for your nails I use
oil specifically for your hair
I mean argan oil I probably have three
bottles in my bathroom of argan oil I
buy them myself I also seem to get sent
a lot of oils from companies for review
which is absolutely great I think it
just tells me that I talk about my love
for oils a lot if the companies keep
sending them to me and I'm like yes
please do because I use them every
single day I'm such a fan of them since
I've started using oils on my skin on my
hair on my nails I have definitely
noticed a difference I mean I would say
especially for my hair I have to use oil
in my hair after I shower sometimes I
use just an oil in my hair sometimes I
use different product
and I like will cocktail the oil in with
them but I don't skip having oil in my
hair but also even after I get out of
the shower I always like to put on a
lotion but I also now will always do an
oil and sometimes I'll do just an oil
and skip the lotion because I feel like
the oil does such a great job and that
was one thing that I really noticed with
this Neutrogena oil in particular is
that I can skip the lotion application
and just use this oil so I did it both
ways when I was testing out this product
I would use it on my skin and then use
lotion like normal and then after trying
out that for a little bit then I would
use just the oil and skip the lotion to
see if I thought you know what the
results were any different and I was
very surprised because I think with
every other oil that I use for my body I
will always then put some sort of like
moisturizing lotion over it and you
really I found that I did not need it
with this particular oil and that just
impressed me so much because you know
it's just another step that I can skip
sometimes I say that like I hate
showering because it takes so long and I
don't just mean showering but when
you're in there of course you're
cleaning your body you're shampooing
your hair you're conditioning your hair
sometimes I put a like a conditioning
treatment in my hair that I have to
leave on for five minutes in the shower
you're trying to shave your body like
there's just so much going on but then
when you get out of the shower then you
have to dry off then you have to put oil
on my bodies and how to put lotion on my
body and then I'm putting oil in my hair
and then more product in my hair and
comb out my hair like is an ordeal so to
have just like one step that I'm able to
skip I thought that was pretty cool but
it's just amazing how well this product
like absorbs into your body I was very
impressed with that that's like my
biggest impression that I got from it
was that it really does do what it says
that it's going to do which sounds silly
but that always impresses me when that
happens because not every product
delivers on what it says it's going to
do and I thought that this one did I
have only used this product when I am
out of the shower
but I've been looking at more reviews
and reading what other people are saying
and some people are saying that they
like to use it actually in their shower
like before they go to get out they put
a few drops in their hands rub it over
their bodies and like let it soak in
basically while they're still in the
shower and then get off and towel off
like normal and they said they really
like that as well so my kid thought give
that a try to me I'm kind of like if I
put it on in the shower is it just gonna
like wipe off right away if the if the
shower is still running but I don't know
a lot of people are saying that they do
it that way so I'll give it a try I
don't take baths I can't remember the
last bath I've taken I'm I'm not a bath
person at all mostly because I get in
there and I'm like what are you supposed
to do now I'm very much like
multitaskers so to just like sit in a
bathtub I'm like what are we doing I
can't say on that part if you put it in
with your bath if it makes your water
softer but honestly I would say I
probably think that it would I have just
used it out of the shower but on damp
skin so like I get out of the shower and
like very lightly pat myself basically
so I'm just not like dripping water all
over to the floor and then I put it on
my skin I have also gotten out of the
shower and like completely dry it off
and then put it on my skin I think I see
the result a little bit better when I
still have like some of that dampness
going on so I'm not like fully dried off
yet
I think I prefer that to being fully
dried off but the the difference between
them are very minimal so you know
sometimes I get out of the shower and I
just automatically dry off and then I'm
like oh shoot I didn't put my oil on not
a big deal I don't see a huge difference
but if I had to pick a preference it
would be to have damp skin but it does
it absorbs very quickly into your body
it doesn't leave you feeling oily like I
have some oils that when you put it on
you almost feel like like you're
slippery and it's kind of awkward then
you're trying to put clothes on you're
like oh is this going on over my clothes
I don't notice that with this particular
oil which I really really am a fan of
for the smell I actually
I really like the smell and I can't
figure out what I think it smells like
and it's kind of driving me batty like
it has it's on my hands right now I can
smell it there is something it is
triggering like it's trying to trigger a
memory in my mind and I feel like it has
something to do with my grandma but I
cannot think of what this sentence but I
really like it it's a very light scent
it's nothing super overpowering and it
doesn't stay on with me all day so I
don't like have a smell once it applies
to my body it basically disappears so I
don't think smell is any sort of big
deal
people ask if it has a pump it doesn't
so it has the cap that you pop open and
then I don't know if you guys are going
to be able to see it but then it just
has where you would just pour it out
into your hands like it has a little
tiny spout right here but you don't have
to like push in the sides of the bottle
like literally I can just tip it over
and the product will come out since
there is that like real tiny hole it's
not like going to be crazy or wild or
anything but it does come out fast and I
mean a lot of product does come out so
that's something to be careful of but
again it's oil I mean even if I have a
lot of my hands I'm just rubbing it all
over my body so it's really not that big
of a deal
surprise I think I'm seeing it being
sold anywhere from like the ten to
fifteen dollar range looking at
different stores and online and things
like that which I don't think is a bad
price for something that is this large
8.50 fluid ounces and again I have been
using this for a while and it is like
not going anywhere so I think I will
have this sitting on my bathroom vanity
for a long time so that is my review
video on the Neutrogena light Sesame
body oil if you guys have any specific
questions for the product please do just
comment below let me know I'm happy to
answer them if I am able to again thank

not have in my beauty routine so I'm so
happy to be able to test out a new
product especially one that I was able

it and to realize that I love it and I
definitely recommend it especially it
was like the winter months coming here
in Iowa and my skin gets so dry like I

I'm getting out of the shower but for
