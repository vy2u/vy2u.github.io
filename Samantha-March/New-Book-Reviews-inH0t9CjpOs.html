back today with another book review
video and I have a lot of both to talk
about I can't even remember the last
time I did a book review video and I
have read so much because there's been
so many summer books going on so i think
i have seven books that i'm going to
share with you i even have more but
trying to break this into smaller video
so hopefully they won't be too long but
if you want to see what books i have
been reading and reviewing please keep
on jumping into it I actually realized
once I was playing back the intro that I
forgot to take out my hair band I just
did my makeup right before I did this
video and i put my hair band in and when
i do my makeup to keep my hair out of my
face and then somehow forgot that it was
in there and started recording anyways
and just realized it but we're gonna
keep it in there i have had like just a
few comments not a lot but the like your
hair always looks the same where it's
always down or wanting to wear your hair
up or things like that I just prefer to
wear my hair down so that's usually what
I do in videos I usually don't do
anything with my hair sometimes if I am
filming on a weekend I haven't curled
because I'm going somewhere but usually
this is just like my natural hair what I
got going on a little bit of a different
look today so we'll see how you guys
like that one and into the book reviews
the first one that i have is dear
internet it's me Avery and this is by
Jennifer a Moscato maybe this book was
really funny really like the cover of it
I thought it like it was very cute and I
was very eye-catching but this is so
funny you guys I didn't know this until
right now I'm looking at the amazon page
because i was going to read you a little
bit of it but the second like editorial
review listed in me and in my review
that i have on Chiclets plus such i'll
leave the link below in my review i say
i laughed so hard i snorted a giggle so
much i got tears and this is a must for
your summer reading list and then it
says Samantha March Chiclets plus review
blog so that's really cool I did not
know that was on there amazon page so
thank you very much Jennifer for
putting that in there is fun to read but
yeah that's basically what I thought of
the book it was so funny I was always
laughing the writing is very quick very
snappy very sharp it didn't take me very
long at all to get through this book and
it's such a few are chocolate fan like I
just know that you're going to love this
one so very highly recommended and the
next one that i have is twin peaks and
this is by Tracy banister and this book
was once again hilarious chicklet book I
had such a fun time reading it I really
do like Tracy's books a lot i highly
recommend her if you haven't read any of
her books but twin peaks follows two
twin sisters and they are like totally
different I had a lot of fun reading
about both sisters because they are so
very different and Willa made me laugh a
lot she's more of like the free-spirited
sister and like you never really knew
what exactly was going to come out of
her mouth so there was a lot of fun
moments with her there is some mystery
in the book as well which I always enjoy
but then there was a pretty big plot
twist I thought at the end I actually
didn't see this coming and I won't tell
you what it is because I want you to
read the book so you can find out what
that is didn't see that coming and it
just made me like the book even more I
felt like it brought even more depth
into the book so super funny villa is a
pet psychic which I I know I mentioned
this book in one of my in my mailbox
post and I was like that got me right
away like who is a pet psychic i
absolutely love that and really those
parts of the book were so fun of you
guys and I actually talked to my husband
about it I was like I wish we could find
a pet psychic so someone could tell me
like what areas really thinks of us and
really funny book I highly enjoyed it
and I hope you can pick it up as well
and the next book that I have is 800
grapes and this is by Laura Dave and I
mentioned this one in a mailbox video as
well and I mentioned like how much I
just loved the cover because I
absolutely love this cover this is not
the first book i've read by laura dave
and i highly recommend her and really
did have a lot going on
the very last line on the back cover is
800 grapes as a story about the messy
realities of family the strengths and
weaknesses of romantic love and the
importance of finding a place to call
home so basically we follow Georgia and
she's having some issues not only with
her family and she's discovering some
family secrets but she's also having
problems in her relationship she finds
out a really big secret about her fiance
and the book kind of takes us through
what happens after she finds that out
and you know how they make things work I
really enjoyed the family aspects of the
book Georgia has brothers and she relies
on them a lot and they were interesting
to read about because we also get a look
into their lives as well and what they
have going on and they also have a lot
going on and they're subplots were
really interesting to read about same
with her parents they have a lot going
on in their lives as well that we're
learning about I I really did enjoy it i
do recommend it i will say that i
thought the beginning started off just a
little bit slow and sometimes the book
run at a slower pace than what i like
but still overall I thought it was a
very good book I really really enjoyed
it and I think it is a good beat read
for the summer and the next one that I
have is the blow off and this is by
Mickie Jay Corrigan and if you can't
tell from the cover this is a bit of a
sexier book but it is it's a really fast
read it says the the print length is 152
pages so I write it off my kindle and i
thought it was very fast but we follow
shia and basically is like a woman
of the night and she decides that she
doesn't want to be that anymore she
actually works as like a hooker for one
night and then i was like no this
actually is not for me but she
understands how much money one could
make from being in that profession and
she decides to try to start her own kind
of business with some other
females as well and they devised a plan
of basically seducing men and drugging
them and then robbing them it but so
that is kind of like the business plan
that they come up with and then we just
get like really quick snippets of
different men that they try to seduce
and rob and all that good stuff so
really fast read I do recommend that
your holders would read this because
there is a lot of heavy and graphic
sexual content in here but also at the
same time I laughed a lot throughout
this book and I thought it was really
funny I really enjoyed following Shia
and she has her own like little romantic
endeavor happening on the side as well
that I thought was really interesting to
read about and overall I thought this
book was really good I wasn't sure you
know reading the blurb it's kind of like
oh I don't know am I gonna like that i'm
not a huge erotica person so don't not
totally what i would say is like my main
genre but i thought this book was
hysterical very well written and just
short and quick so if you're looking for
just a little fun read to kind of take
you into another world for a few hours
of your day i would recommend this one
to you i just have two more books left
to share for this video but the next one
is confessions of a virgin sex columnist
and it's by kamery also writes under
Kaitlyn Davis and that says it in the
cover there you can't garner from the
title ballo Skylar Quinn and she lands a
job as a sex columnist but she happens
to be a virgin her big problem so not
only does she basically feel like a
fraud in her job because she's giving
out all the sex advice yet she is a
virgin but she lives with her best
friend Bridget and she is in love with
Bridget's brother Oliver and they kind
of had a moment together several years
before and now Oliver is back and he's
actually living with the girls for a
while so she is you know hesitant about
this happening she still has feelings
for him she doesn't think that he has
ever had feelings for her because of
like
her tonight shared years before and her
best friend knows absolutely nothing
about any of this and then also along
the way she actually gets a boyfriend
who seems like you know mr. right and
mr. wonderful and she's trying to make a
relationship work with him all the while
she still is in love with Oliver and he
always has new women around I thought it
was such a cute romance you know
sometimes sure I feel like things can be
a little bit predictable and you know
that always seems to be a problem with
like Chiclets or women's fiction or
romance or whatever usually chiclet gets
the big stigma of being predictable but
you know maybe you think you might know
how the ending is going to come about
but the journey there and what happens
along the way and the characters that
are you know discussed and brought about
and create it and brought to life you
know they're always very different and
it's always so much fun reading those
journeys I won't tell you of course what
happens at the end but really cute bug
that I thought was a pretty fast read
and there's a lot of funny moments in
here too so this book is another one
that I really enjoyed then the very last
book and I wanted to end on this book
because I loved it so much is love at
first flight and this is by Tesla's and
I don't know kind of when I first saw
the cover like before even reading the
bull herb I saw the cover and I was like
oh that's probably you know seems like
it's going to be a chiclet book but then
I started reading and it was very
evident right away that this one is not
chiclet it is women's fiction and it was
a very powerful and emotional book I
have so many good things to say about
this book I absolutely loved it I have
since formed a friendship with test
woods and we talked a lot on line and I
think she is such an amazing person and
a incredible writer this is her debut
novel which I'm like blown away by
because I thought it was so so
well-written and it gave me so many
different emotions while reading it but
basically we follow Mel and Mel is
married she has children as she's
successful her husband is successful you
know they seem like one of those great
couples but you know we never
really know what's going on behind
closed doors and her life really isn't
as great as it seems on a flight one day
she meets Matt and it really is like a
love at first sight between both of them
between both melt and matt i said in my
review it's crazy for me to say how much
i love this book because we're reading
about an affair and sometimes I know
there's a lot of people out there that
don't want to read about that and don't
believe in that and that's totally fine
and I can definitely understand that
unfortunately you know that is real life
that is true life I mean this does
happen though sometimes it can be really
hard to read the words on the pages it
just brings you in it brings you into
their world and I feel like I'm going
all over the place there because there's
so many things that I want to say to you
but then I don't want to because I
really really want you guys to read this
book because I thought it was such a
beautiful book and I think it'll bring
up a lot of emotions in you I feel like
I'm getting emotional just talking about
the book because it really really did
move me but so good so well written
there's a lot of twists and turns the
ending I honestly did not see coming you
might talk about books that are
predictable and you know I just kind of
touched on that before this is one that
I did not think was predictable at all
there's a lot that will keep you on your
toes there is so much content in the
book but it never seemed like it was
really long or dragged on I always felt
invested in the story it was so hard to
put down this was a book that like as
I'm putting mascara on my eyelashes I'm
trying to read from my Kindle that's
sitting on my bathroom vanity because
I'm like I couldn't stop reading just
one of my favorite books of the year I
have so many good things to say about it
I could probably keep going on forever
but I will just wrap it up by saying I
truly would like all my heart recommend
this book and I thought it was just
absolutely incredible that is the book
that I wanted to end on because I love
ending on high notes and those are the
books that i have read and reviewed
recently all of my reviews are on
chocolate plus and i will leave links to
my direct reviews below as well as the
