happy 2016 if I haven't told you guys
enough happy new year I'm so excited to
be in a new year a fresh start I'm
excited for it video I'm going to be
doing just a little drugstore haul we
recently got a CVS in our area and they
had a ton of great coupons for their
grand opening and I started shopping
there these are this is probably like
three different trips and then I kind of
put a hold on myself because the drug
store is coming out with new things like
crazy I'm like okay hold on I need to
start buying the new things so I kind of
stopped and was waiting for more new
stuff to be carried in there but I
wanted to share with you guys when I got
so far I'm back in my old setting right
now I'm actually super duper crunched
for time I'm filming this like two and a
half hours behind schedule and I'm just
I'm going to lose my light at any moment
now but it was just I didn't have enough
time to be able to set up my backdrop
and then set up the new lights i got
with it so I'm like I just need to come
down here and make sure I get this
filmed and up for you guys but if you
guys would like to see what i've
recently gotten from the drugstore
please keep watching all right so if you
guys haven't seen i actually did just
post a top-15 drugstore beauty products
of 2015 so i will link it up here and in
the description box below i just kind of
go over what my favorite drugstore
products was throughout the year and i'm
excited to do this at the end of this
year because i didn't get on youtube
when till May so I didn't do a high-end
beauty video i did a book video as well
side it because this year I'll be like
fully immersed in everything and I'm
really excited about it so I'm going to
do a good job of like keeping track of
what I'm getting and what I think is the
bomb because by the time we get to
December it's like what happened in
January so I'm going to try to do a
really good job so I can do good on my
year-end videos next year seemed so far
away okay so this was a while ago but
unlike my very first trip to CBS I was
excited because they have nick's
products there and we just have a
walgreens in our area and they don't
carry Nick's at least the walgreens that
I shopped at did not carry Nick's so I
was so excited to see Nixon there
and I picked up these soft matte lip
creams got the shade london and i got
the shades London and Milan and these
are what the swatches look like London
is the like brownish nude one and Milan
is a bright pink Milan is actually a lot
brighter pink then I was expecting I'm I
upon looking at it I thought maybe would
be like a ma be pink it's not its a
bright pink and the London is a lot more
new design I thought it would be but i
like it i especially liked it as a
topper and both of these are matte so
they'd rise to a matte finish and i do
agree with that i do things i'd ride to
a matte but they're not a liquid
lipstick and that they are so drying
that you get the butthole lips going on
I don't get that with these which is
really nice but they just don't feel as
drying RS tight on the lips as like
colour-pop liquid lipstick one so I
really like that about it and i also
like that they're longer wearing i did
mention these um in my favorites of 2015
and I just like them because they wear
longer than a regular lipstick and they
don't smudge easily and I just really
liked that a bottom so I'm going to pick
up more of these for sure also on one of
my first trips when I said to you guys I
was like hey CBS is opening in our area
what should I go by everyone was like
Milani Luminoso blush I was like all
right off I'll pick it up holy crap this
was another that was in my favorites and
I don't understand how I didn't have
this blush in my life for so long I wear
it so much it is so beautiful it's like
a peachy it's got a little bit of
shimmer to it it's so beautiful i love
to wear it with a very minimal makeup
look and then I just load up on this
stuff and highlighter and it is so
beautiful if you do not have Milani
Luminoso please go get it I did pick up
a few new maybelline lipsticks as well I
love my billing lipsticks I included the
Maybelline maps in my 2015 favorites
video I love their matte formula it is
so good but I picked up a touch of spice
which we immediately became best friends
I said this in my 2015 video I loved it
and I also
picked up truffle teas which is one of
their glossy lip sticks and it's
actually the lipstick I'm wearing right
now is truffle tease so those are the
swatches on my hand right there touch of
spice is like a pinkish red a little bit
of brown undertones in there and then
truffle tease is just a very sheer brown
nude and i love it when I need to just
like something quick and easy like I
don't want to take the time to do a
liquid lipstick but I still want
lipstick on I'm going with truffle tease
like I said I was in a rush to make this
video and I was like what should i do
for lipstick truffle tease and there we
go it worked out on my most recent trip
to the drugstore I picked up a few new
products from Maybelline and I just got
these so they're not even out of the
packaging yet but I got the better skin
concealer and I have the better skin
foundation and I absolutely love it I
wear it all the time my bottle is
definitely getting down there I was sent
it from Influenster I included it in my
2015 favorites I absolutely love it as a
foundation and I've heard really good
things about the concealer so I'm like
might as well give it a try I picked
mine up in light and also i picked up
the Maybelline lash sensational mascara
that's what it looks like I don't do
drugstore mascara very often wasn't
really sure but I wanted to pick
something up because i feel like when i
do drugstore tutorials or talk about
drug store I don't really have any
mascaras that I can pull out so I knew I
needed to get one and I saw Babs beauty
talk about this and so I was like I'm
gonna get it because I really like her
and trust her opinion so that's what I
picked up at one point the CVS was also
having a sale on lashes so I picked up a
bunch of our dell whoops false lashes I
absolutely love our dell lashes I wear
them all the time I started wearing them
when I was first learning how to put
false eyelashes on and now I just
recommend him to everybody but I picked
up a couple of their glamour lashes and
a few different styles and the wispies
and the 105 and then I dropped something
but it looks to be like their natural
lashes I picked those up to love our
doll lashes it also did pick up a few
goodies that I'm going to be including
in my 1k giveaway when we get there I
have started purchasing for it and I'm
very excited I may have just put in an
order for Sephora for some goodies for
you guys but this will be in the
giveaway it is the Loreal infallible
eyeshadow in amber rush and then I also
picked you guys up a NYX jumbo pen
pencil NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk
these are amazing I use them in my New
Year's Eve tutorial you cannot beat
l'oreal infallible I shadows they are
the bomb I hear really good things about
you a rush it's like a copper color and
then the knicks milk pencil is like a
staple everyone needs this everyone has
to have it you have to have it if you
don't have it I'm going to give it to
you if you do have it i'm giving you a
backup use it for you coming soon first
thing i wanted to mention it is from the
drugstore though i did not purchase it
myself but it is the sally hansen nail
polish I got sent this hard as nails
xtreme where polish and the shade violet
voltage I got this because i received a
sally hansen influenster voxbox from
Influenster like in the summer and if
you're not familiar with influenster
i've talked about it a lot on my channel
i will leave it linked below basically
you sign up for influenster you take
little like surveys and quizzes and
influenster will then match you with
different companies they will send you
products to review you review you talk
about on social media that sort of thing
and then at the end of each box box I
think it's at the end it's been for the
end of all my box boxes if you do like
if you complete all the challenges you
enter to win a prize and i won the sally
hansen prize and I was super excited
about exile of sally hansen and they
sent everyone this nail polish now don't
mind me because i was in a rush i didn't
get to paint my nails but i did just
have this one on you can still kind of
see it I very hurriedly took off my nail
polish so it's still kind of sitting on
my nails because that's cute but I
really liked this color it was funny
because I also just got sent another
purple nail polish from like sinful
colors and I don't have a lot of purple
and now all of a sudden I have a ton of
purple polish but I'm not mad about it
it was cool because it's like a
bender it's like a deeper lavender color
but it has like some sort of like your
doesn't sheen to it it was pretty cool I
was excited I love Sally Hansen very
pleased I got this and one more thing to
talk about and I'm so so excited for
this and have to tell you guys a story
so I wanted this the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi cushion foundation I wanted this
real bad i'm sorry i can see I'm
blinding you guys with that I've been
seeing people talk about it it's brand
new to the drugstore and I was like you
know what I'm gonna go pick this up
because i love drugstore foundation i
include it like four or five in my 2015
favorites so I was like I'm gonna go get
it see what happens I go to the CVS I'm
in the beauty aisle I'm in L'Oreal Lyle
no foundation and I'm like you know what
Samantha it's brand new it's probably
not even here yet hasn't even launched
yet like you're dumb just go buy stuff
for your giveaway and then hit the
Maybelline I all up and that's exactly
what I did and then I just started to
kind of wander around CVS seeing if
there was anything else I needed to get
and it was like over in the grocery
aisle a woman was setting out these and
I walked up to her and I was like oh I'm
sorry are these for sale and she looks
at me because literally setting them out
in huge boxes putting them on shelves
not in the beauty section so I'm like
what are they doing now go are these on
sale and she looks at me and goes yeah I
think so I'm like okay well I'm gonna
buy one that's kind of why I came here

haven't put you know any pricing out
