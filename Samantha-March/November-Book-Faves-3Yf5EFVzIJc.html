today's video since we are now in
December this is going to be a favorites
video this is going to be the book
favorites for the month of November so
this isn't me all the books that
reviewed on chiclet plus in the month of
November that got five stars either from
myself or farm my review team I'm really
bummed out I mentioned in one of my past
videos that i finally bought a real
camera i was so excited for this camera
to finally be able to stop filming off
my phone like maybe the quality would be
better with it getting into the winter
we just don't have sunshine anymore in
iowa like today it's just gloomy it's
rainy it's not well for filming I've
just hated all of these videos that I'm
putting out I just feel like they look
terrible but I mean it's either that or
nothing so I bought a camera it was so
pumped about it I'm returning the camera
it apparently was not the camera that I
thought it was I don't know if I just
like got super excited and didn't bother
to like double check everything but the
camera is definitely not going to work
out it's not what I need it all so that
sucks I'm returning it and hopefully
I'll be able to find the actual camera
that I want some time soon so this
quality can stop I found like an old
lamp that we weren't using and I was
like oh maybe I can put the lamp around
here and that will help for the lighting
it doesn't it doesn't help at all like I
put the lamp right behind where I film
it made zero difference like not even
and I had a difference so I'm like well
this sucks because I was having so much
fun making these videos and now I'm kind
of starting to dread making them so I
don't know hopefully we'll be able to
find an actual good quality camera at
some point in the near future but I have
talked about can you tell them really
I'm really upset about it so when I get
upset I tend to ramble do have quite a
few books to cover that got five stars
in November so let's just get on to
happier news so one little piece of good
news was that I did get in like a video
editing software program thing and so i
can now like put book covers and stuff
in these videos like in one of my videos
i made it snow and so I had a lot of fun
with that was so funny I was like all
the pieces are coming together I got a
camera I got this software oh it's gonna
be great well I mean at least without
half of it you can't you can't have
everything all at once right I mean
lesson learned send it for that so first
book back at five stars in November is
running with knives and this is by
Michelle Boadicea I believe is how you
say it and i will say that i kind of
like did a little bit of let that whole
like judging a book by it's cover like I
saw the cover and I was like yeah you
know but it looks good huh I'll give it
a read the synopsis sounded very
interesting to me and I was so happy I
read it because obviously is in the
favorites video I loved it but basically
we follow holly and she gets on like a
reality TV program for like chefs and i
love food ebooks so I had a lot of fun
with this one because she gets on the
show and then they're having to make
these different dishes and it's kind of
talking about each thing that they have
to make and I was just like eating it up
didn't even mean to make that pun fast
reading it um she's having some problems
in her marriage and part of the problem
has to do with the reality show that
she's on like it's all kind of connected
there's a lot of like backstabbing
manipulation happening and I just I had
such a good time reading it I'm so happy
I read it so that was running with
knives so the next one to get five stars
is borrow a bridesmaid and this is by an
Wagoner and Michelle is the one who
reviewed this one and in her review she
said I love chiclet books that can make
me laugh out loud and this one
definitely did so that's good and but
basically in the book we follow it looks
like we follow Piper she makes a cry
less ad offering herself up as a hired
bridesmaid moje she said she's a recent
college grad who decided to sell her
body on craigslist as a bridesmaid and
her airport bookseller job isn't
bringing home the turkey bacon and turns
out having an english literature degree
from an upstanding use university isn't
all it's cracked up to be and so she
gets clients like southern peach Stacey
who's interracial marriage causes the
family feud alex has a bride-to-be who
so typing she's a plus and so we go
through her different weddings that does
sound extremely funny actually i bet i
would really like that book too but that
is borrow a bridesmaid her stars is
counting stars and this is by kathleen
long this is one that i was kind of
bummed out about because i've read
kathleen lon before and I've really
enjoyed her books and so I'm like shoot
why didn't I read this one but annie is
the one who read it and she gave it five
stars and in her review she said that
she thoroughly engulfed this story with
Arlo Bernadette and her brother Mark
dies unexpectedly and says her world is
rocked Jenny the wife he left behind
skips grieving and go straight into
survival mode that is until she shows up
at Bernie's door in tears holding a
battered canvas journal in which mark
once obsessed with adventure had listed
larger-than-life travel destinations so
it looks like the they get inspired by
his unique bucket list and they set off
on a cross-country road trip that sounds
really sweet so yeah but i would have
really liked that one darn it but that
is counting stars by kathleen long is it
30 days to 30 and this is by courtney
sack to zack i know i just talked about
this in one of my videos and i was like
how do you say this last name i'm so bad
at pronouncing names but i read this one
for CLP blog tours I believe Courtney
will still be on tour by the time this
video comes out and you can win a fifty
dollar amazon gift card with her torso i
will leave all of those links below so
you guys can get entered into that
giveaway so basically we follow Jill who
she's 30 days away from turning 30 she
loses her job she had a great career she
lose
her job and then the day that she is let
go from her job she comes home and finds
her boyfriend with someone else so she
moves back home she moves back in with
her parents to try to get life figured
out and she finds a list that she wrote
for herself when she I believe when she
was she a little believe it was from
when she was in high school and she had
like her bucket list of things that she
wanted to do or achieve before she
turned 30 and so she decides to do all
these items and you know try to get as
many done as she can she kind of starts
off of the blog while she's at it and
and then that blog kind of like gains
traction and more people are like
following along her story which I
thought was so cool i really enjoyed
that aspect of it obviously because i
love blogging and i think it's a really
awesome way to bring people together but
i just thought that was really neat too
but yeah overall I mean of course
there's romance in the book there's
friendships in there to her family
dynamic I thought was really funny and
there is some scenes in there with yoga
if you guys know I'm a big yogi I am
half of the cheeky chicks on Instagram
and I was like I was taking pictures of
the yoga scenes in the book and sending
him to my best friend who the other half
of the cheeky tricks I was sending them
to her like this is freaking hysterical
they were so funny so yeah great book
obviously I give him five stars that's
30 days to 30 is death before decaf and
this is by Carolyn ferdig as I adjust my
hair and I have rod Carolyn before I
really enjoy her mystery books look
below I'll leave some links below to my
other reviews for her but when I saw a
death before decaf I was like yes I have
to read it I love these type of mystery
books where they're on the lighter side
kind of like Chiclets mystery almost and
I know that I enjoy her writing I loved
the cover I thought that was I just I
loved it and then of course obviously I
came to love the book as well since it's
being included in this favourites video
we follow Juliet I feel like I say that
at the start if I sent that at the start
of like every single book but basically
this is what we do
I'm clearly not on my game today you
guys and I I do apologize for that but
we follow Juliet who like her
relationship was falling apart her
career has also basically gone downhill
so she steps in to run a cafe you know
I'm gonna say of course there's like
romance involved in that sort of thing
which is I really like the the angle on
that but the biggest part of course is
the mystery and that one of the
employees shows up dead very quickly
into her helping run this cafe and she's
kind of the suspect for a while she
didn't have a great relationship with
this employee they got into a fight
she's actually the one that finds him
which of course and everyone looks at
you if you know find the dead body type
thing and so it just kind of goes
through trying to track down who the
real murderer is and I kind of thought I
knew like I thought enough hints for
being dropped that I was like yeah I'm
pretty sure I know who this is but then
of course I was like kind of right but
then there's more to it obviously i'm
not i'm not going to tell you what's all
to it because i want you to read it
because I loved him but that was death
before decaf the next one is when in
doubt and this is by Emily hammer and a
nice one who gave this one a five star
review I'm filming with the flash on
obviously and it's starting to give to
the point where like I can't really see
anything because the flash is hurting my
eyes so bad so I'm trying to like read
Annie's review to tell you what she said
but I can't read my computer screen
anymore so i'm at i'm not totally
positive what Annie said in her review
but I mean she really liked it a lot but
I can kind of read on the surface
because it's closer to me but like food
skin tough but basically we follow I did
it again we follow win Jeffries it says
her life has stalled somewhere between
graduating from college and slinging
drinks at a local dive bar she has no
career no boyfriend but she dreams of
something more something amazing a
well-kept family secret is finally
revealed ooh I like that I like the
sounds of that so yeah that looks like a
good one I really liked
or two I really I was drawn to that one
right away that is when in doubt the
next one is house trained and this is by
Jackie Bouchard I hope I'm saying that
right and I believe Annie reviewed this
one as well okay I I know Jackie like
online we belong to same with a few
author groups and I think she is like
one of the most nicest people out there
she's always very encouraging and these
groups at very like vocal with everyone
I just think that is so cool so I was so
excited to have her on chocolate plus
and then Annie left a book I was like
yeah five stars this cover i think is so
adorable and it says that we follow alex
she is childless by choice she's an
interior designer and dog mom and a true
perfectionist now i'm all about the dog
mom life yes um it says her orderly life
turns chaotic when the teenage daughter
her husband Barry never knew he had
shows up on their doorstep with a baby
girl of her own oh that's interesting
from wrestling author Jackie Bouchard
comes a humorous and heartwarming look
at how life creates opportunities to
love in a surprising way my husband just
got home let's try to wrap this up fun
is the hundred gifts and this is by
jennifer scott christie reviewed this
one and i absolutely love this cover but
Christy's review i think it said
something along the lines of like when
you read this you'll want to tell your
girlfriend's to read it too which i
thought was really cool follow national
best-selling author of the sister season
hi I'm filming good I'll be there in a
second I'm filming and losing light and
losing memory and all that good stuff
this one says it's from the National
best-selling author of the sister season
and she shares a new novel about a woman
who discovers the spirit of the season
is truly in the giving like it's around
the holiday time to when we follow Bryn
who realizes for the first time in
decades she has no large family to cook
for and no celebration to create she
starts teaching a holiday cooking class
and it's a hit until an old lady oops
there's bursted in complaining that's
funny kind of reminds me of a place
where I used to live um Brens suggests
that the class shower Virginia was
kindness and give her 100 gifts so they
embarked on a plan to lift the heart ah
that sounds cute the last one is love in
the details and this is by Becky Wade
and Annie reviewed this one q cover
again I don't know if these covers are
like they're being all cute like so it
says Holly ended things to give him a
better life but she was the future he'd
always dreamed of ooh that sounds good
um eight years have passed since Holly
last saw her high school sweetheart Josh
now the wedding of Josh's best friend
has brought him back to Texas he's the
best man and holly is the church's
volunteer wedding coordinator so they
get linked together and they have to
confront the painful memories and it
says that she broke up with Josh all
those years ago in an attempt to ensure
his future success however she never
told him the true reason behind her
actions and now she must decide whether
to keep her secret hidden so that sounds
sounds very interesting so Annie clearly
loved it and i'll give it those are all
