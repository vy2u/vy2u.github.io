thanks for watching today today's video
is going to be my november book reviews
so i'm going to go through each of the
books that i read in november me myself
personally read for chocolate plus and
just kind of give my feedback on them
what I thought about them and do just a
little book review for them so if you
would like to see my November reading
list please keep walking so the first
one that I read is clutch by lisa becker
and i will put the covers over here for
you guys as i talk about him i read this
one for CLP blog to worse i'm a big fan
of ELISA Becker i have read i think i've
mentioned her on this channel before but
she has like click and double click and
right click and those books were all
written like via social media emails
Facebook statuses that sort of thing and
it just really intrigued me and I really
enjoyed reading them I thought she did
an amazing job with that series so I was
excited when she was when I saw that she
was bringing out clutch and I'm telling
you just by reading the blurb for it I
was like I have to read this book it
again just sounds like the word I used
in my review on chocolate plus was
clever it was just such a a clever devil
well-thought-out novel funny book like I
laughed a lot but basically we follow
Carolyn and she is a purse designer and
she kind of goes through like her her
men that she's dating and she compares
them each to different bags and I'm
telling you if you like chocolate and if
you need a humorous book to kind of like
pep you up be sure to check out clutch
the next one that I read and reviewed
was put a ring on it by Beth Kendrick
and I absolutely love this cute cover
that i will put over here I'm a really
big fan of Beth Kendrick i highly enjoy
her novels i think i've read pretty much
everything that she's put out there very
much recommender to women's section
readers and lovers so put a ring on it
as part of the black dog bay series and
i have also read cure for the common
breakup and new uses for old boyfriends
those are both a part of that series
loved those books and I was super
excited to get this one I will say with
this one I did give it a
four-star review because I still enjoyed
it I didn't think it was quite the level
of the first two books in the series um
I i know that i enjoyed those little
more bleep it gave those both five star
reviews this one while it started off
really well for me and i was enjoying it
that way but it was kind of like once we
got probably passed the middle of the
book it all of a sudden seemed to like
slow down a lot for me and I was almost
getting frustrated with the characters
like the whole back-and-forth like no
I'm not going to get to the relationship
yes I should give us a relationship like
it just happened like two too many times
for me and I just was kind of like come
on let's let's do something but the
majority of the like first half of the
novel I thought was really good we
follow Brighton who is someone who like
in the blurb it says she doesn't do
outrageous she's a very practical person
but her engagement gets called off and
then all of a sudden she gets a call
from her ex-fiance who says he just got
married on a whim like he doesn't even
know what happened he just all son got
married and so she kind of decides to do
the same thing and from the series we
know the guy that she gets married to
and that excited me because he had he
had a role this jake has a role in the
other two books and how he tied in with
this book I thought was so cute i
absolutely loved it i was surprised i
thought it was great but again like just
towards the end I was kind of like what
are we doing here but still a really
good book give it four stars that I read
and reviewed was collision by PJ buyer
and I also got this for my blog to our
company CLP blog tours now with this one
I actually I I didn't I don't know how
to say this the right way but like I
didn't really want to read this one I
was going to pass it off to someone on
my review team simply because of the
cover like I judged a book by the cover
I did it admit it and that's not cool to
do I know that but just kind of on first
glance I was like I'll see you if anyone
else can fit it into their schedule no
one else could so I ended up reading it
and then I was like does mantha that was
that was not a wise
choice because I gave it a 4 star review
it ended up I ended up really liking it
because there's a lot of like suspense
and intrigue and mystery involved in
here and I kind of like those sort of
things and basically we follow Stella
who like runs away from her home she's
unhappy with her home situation she runs
away and then it's almost like one
downside of the book I think is that
there was a lot going on like she's
running away at times you think that
she's gotten into some like very scary
situations she meets a new family and
kind of like gets kind of like starts
being friends with people in this family
it's really hard to describe because
there's so much going on and then she
has these strange dreams that are linked
with something else and then at the end
there's kind of a twist like it's really
really hard to describe I mean it would
probably take me 10 minutes just to
describe this book but I ended up really
liking it even though at points it could
be hard to kind of keep everything in
line and keep everything together I
ended up I thought it was well written
enough that I was able to follow along
okay it's also set in Australia which I
thought was a lot of fun the language is
a little different and there's some like
scenery and bits like that that I
thought were interesting to read about
so I give it 4 stars next one that I
reviewed i actually won't go into a lot
of detail with because i did give it a
five star review and this is running
with knives by michelle buca and i
actually talk more about that book in
the November favorites video which is
already live so I will put it in the
cards up here but I'll also link it in
the description box below the November
favorites video will feature all the
books on Chiclets Plus that was given 5
stars2 in the month of November so
that's for me and my review team I go
through each of those five star books
the next one that I read and reviewed is
out back promise and this was by Meggie
Bolitho and this one was also said in
Australia and I remember saying in my
review that there was a few phrases that
I was like what is that and I had to
google a few things and it was kind of
fun because then I like I'll test out
those phrases on my friends to see if
they get that I'm saying something crazy
and it's also it's a very like it's
almost kind of a sad story there's a
very
sad part in the book dealing with a
death of a child and I remember actually
reading the scene and my bathroom one
night and I started to cry because it
was very well written and very touching
and like it hurt to read that scene so
be prepared because I remembered not
being prepared so I enjoyed those
aspects of it and then basically we're
following a husband and wife and they're
trying to get their marriage like back
on track after they lose their son and
so while there were certain aspects that
I enjoyed I kind of thought the writing
was like almost a little bit choppy
there would be very short section breaks
and some of them would only be like a
paragraph or two and then it would
switch and go to something else and it
kind of made it hard to read and follow
because it was like you couldn't really
fully get into that scene because it was
so quick and then it was over and then
were jumping into the next scene and it
just I don't know what kind of read a
little wonky to me and it was a little
bit slow at times but there was a good
message in the book and I wanted to keep
reading it it just kind of wasn't the
easiest read it wasn't it didn't flow
super well to me but I still ended up I
gave it a 3.5 stars on chick lipless the
next one I have this Christmas at
cranberry college and this was by tally
Roland now Callie Rowland is another
chiclet author that I'm a huge fan of
guys I'm pretty sure I read all of her
books but she also puts out like she
does full-length novels but then she
also does a lot of novellas and I think
I've read all the novellas as well and
she usually comes out with holiday story
around holiday time she did this is
Christmas at cranberry cottage and I
really enjoyed it I thought it was a
very cute read it's very short I read it
in one sitting and sometimes like I'll
say that I'm not a super huge fan of
novellas because sometimes they're just
so short to me that I'm like wait what
just happened like you sometimes I feel
like I read one scene out of a book and
that was it but her writing is so cute
and uplifting and this book I thought
had very like it was very touching to me
because it features a girl and her
grandmother and she's trying to help
save her grandmother's home that's being
bought out by like the
government developers and things like
that and that part I thought was really
touching to me because I have a special
relationship with my grandmother
involved so I enjoyed reading that but
it is I will warn you it is very short
but it is also only 99 cents if you want
to purchase it and all the amazon links
will be in the description box below
plus all of my links to my review on
Chiclets plus if you want to check those
out to the next one that I reviewed was
30 days to 30 and this is like Courtney
sack and this is another one that I gave
5 stars2 so go ahead and check out that
November favorites video and see why I
gave this one five stars then I got
another five-star one for you I also
read and reviewed death before decaf by
Carolyn far dig in that November gave it
five stars it's more like the chiclet
mystery side and I loved it when i'm
john i read was good riddance by whitney
Fey and Calvin Parker and this one I
love the cover by the way I like the
cover to me was just so eye-catching but
that's what I thought had a very
interesting plot because basically we
follow two friends but the book starts
off with the friends talking to each
other over the phone because someone
that they went to high school with
passed away and like a freak accident
and the girls are kind of discussing the
deaths and then the gal who died she was
planning like their high school reunions
that the two friends decide to take over
to plan it and that's kind of like how
the vote goes along but it's written in
the past and the present so we get the
present but then we also get the past of
when all these girls were on high school
together and the girl who died was just
like that a good person and it's like
the whole town knows that and so like
wow people are sad about her death it's
like they really aren't too torn up
about it and I just I don't know I
thought it was very interesting I
thought it was very well written that it
wasn't like rude or mean or I didn't
dislike any of the characters like it
was it was well written enough to like I
understood and I've kind of felt like I
was in their own little community as
well I enjoyed the two friends that we
followed that each have interesting
storyline going on there is of course
romance in there but I just I totally
loved the flashbacks to the 90s and if
you're now
these kids like you will get it there is
like song lyrics in there that has fun
to read about there's movie mentions in
there like one of my favorite school
intentions yes you know just that the
talk of of what life was like in the 90s
what we were interested in and I had a
blast reading and I gave it four points
for all the books that I read and
reviewed in November for Chiclets plus i
