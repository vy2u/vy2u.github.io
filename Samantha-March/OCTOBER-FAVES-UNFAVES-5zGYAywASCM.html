today's video is going to be my October
favorites and unfortunately i have a few
disappointing products and here as well
to talk about but i'll be going through
everything that i've been loving on
during the past month and then you know
those disappointing products as well oh
I just always hate when that happens but
it happens and this is the best time to
talk about them but I have books I have
fashion and then I have makeup and
beauty so when we just go ahead and hop
into it on that I want to talk about I
like cheating slightly because I don't
really know if I can say it was my
favorite in October but I wanted to talk
to you guys about it because I have a
new book coming out my next book
releases November first so I'm not sure
exactly when this video will be going up
but i will leave a link in the
description box below to my book it is
actually a novella which means it's just
a shorter story and it is a holiday
novella it's called the Christmas
surprise so like I said it's just a
short little read shouldn't take you too
long to get through it it's only 99
cents and its exclusive on amazon so
again there will be a link in the
description box below if you are
interested in purchasing the book even
if this video goes up a couple days I
had a time of november first i will
still there still be a link in the
description box because it should
already be up and ready to go i also did
want to let you guys know that if you do
decide to purchase the book which I
would be so grateful for and if you do
please leave me a comment please do
because I would love to know but if you
do make sure that you hold on to your
amazon order number because my next
video will have a giveaway involved and
it's going to be all around this book
release i'm very very excited for that
video to go up so just so just a warning
if you guys want to purchase the book
make sure you hold on to your amazon
order number or have it readily
available because there's somethin comin
but i'm just really excited it has been
two years since i have put out a book so
it has been a long time coming I excited
to put it out there it actually was
published in a Holiday Collection last
year it was in a collection of short
stories and I've decide
to republish it on its own because it
was in a collection with merging inc
which was my publishing company but
marching inc actually closed as of
october first so that collection is no
longer out there and so I thought this
would be a nice way to still make sure
that that novella is out there because
even though it is a short story of
course did take me time and energy and
everything like that to write it and get
it out there so I'm just really excited
to get a release out there and until let
you guys know that that book no matter
what day this video goes up on that book
should be available right now on amazon
i also wanted to alert you that if you
do see it or you know maybe you're on my
snapchat i'm talking about it just make
sure you hold on to your order number
because you'll need that for something
special that's coming up but thank you
guys so much for all like the
encouragement and support on this
novella especially over on my snapchat
there's quite a few characters in the
story that were actually renamed after
people from my snapchat i ran like a
little giveaway for that and i will do
that again for my upcoming book so if
you don't have me on snapchat yet i'm
just samantha doubt march i'll leave my
little ghost over here but i liked being
able to to do that for you guys because
i was a lot of fun and everyone really
seemed into it which is really cool we
have the Christmas surprise officially
releases the official base is november
first it'll be linked down below as well
as my amazon link if you're interested
in purchasing any of my other books and
i just am so grateful if you do because
that's my full-time job my full-time
career so any support over there is just
it means so much to me so had to sneak
that one in here right quick and on to
fashion I have some brah let's that I
wanted to talk to you guys about these
were actually featured in my last like
clothing haul and try on video that I
did but they're from top left clothing
and they are just like lacy racerback
bra let's I have this one which is in
like a nude color and then I actually
picked up another one in like a really
deep blue color the exact same thing and
when I was at top loft and I was
deciding what I want to get I saw these
and I was like they just looked so
comfortable and I picked up the blue one
first I believe and I was like you know
what I just really want to get this one
too I was like do I need to I don't know
but I'm glad that
I got to because I am obsessed with
these I wear them all the time I
actually had to take the blue one off so
I could show it in this video without
actually having it on me I just I wear
them so much they are super comfortable
they're not like lined or you know have
any padding or anything like that
they're just a super super comfortable
all over lace bralette definitely been
seeing them a lot more on youtubers
because like if I pull my hair back you
can see well oh dear you can see that
i'm wearing a sports bra and then i'm
also wearing a tank top because i'm cold
and then i'm wearing a sweater you know
it's fall in Iowa and I think I'm in the
Arctic but it's it's kind of nice
because when you see things poking out
like it looks nicer than like a sports
bra that you have like this kind of like
lace straps showing I just think it
looks better but really the biggest
thing is is that i think they are super
comfortable when i get out of the shower
I don't know if this is gonna sound
really random but but when i get out of
the shower like the last thing i want to
do is put on like really tight clothes
like I always put on like a really loose
pair of sweatpants after i get a shower
cuz i don't want to put my tight yoga
leggings on and then even putting a
sports bra i'm just like your body still
kind of damp and i always felt like you
know lotion or moisturizer all over my
body and then I'm like trying to fit a
tight sports bra over and I'm like you
know this is no fun so sometimes I'll
just go without a bra and I don't like
doing that but these have been my
answers to that these are what i put on
after my shower and then i just find
them so comfortable that I just really
don't feel like taking them off the only
like downside to it is that it's not
it's not a sports bra and I work out
every day and I need to change to put a
sports bra and I'm like no don't make me
take these off and there's even been
times where I knew that I did not want
to take these off and I just put a
sports bra over them and then did my
workout so now that we know all these
embarrassing things about me I just want
to share with you guys because I've been
recessed with them i've been wearing
them so much and i know they are still
available on the tab off clothing
website so i will leave a link down
below i did mention on my snapchat a
couple other social media accounts but
i'm actually working now with top left
clothing which is really really exciting
to me it
actually owned by my sister-in-law her
name is steph and she recently reached
out to me and asked if i wanted to take
over like online sales and marketing and
i said yes because yes please and so I'm
really excited to be working with that
so i'll be doing a lot with their like
social media accounts and just kind of
handling the online stores and doing
influencer marketing and all that kind
of good stuff so really excited so so
grateful for the opportunity but i did
want to mention it here too as well
really excited to be a part of the top
left clothing family officially sell
wanted to mention that to you guys here
too i believe the lacy bra let's a link
down below as well on talk about is a
newer item as well but i am like so
jacked about this product because now
I've used it a couple more times and I'm
just really excited about it and that is
the sigma beauty cig magic brush shampoo
I recently did a full video on this
because it just released I think the
launch day was October 24th I am an
affiliate with Sigma so they did send
this to me so I could test it out before
it was released and I did film a whole
video doing a review and demo on the
brush cleaner and I was so excited about
it I had just used it for the first time
as I filmed that video but now i have
been using it more and i'm like this
thing is just a lifesaver i will leave
my video link down below so you can see
the demo and kind of how i use this but
this is made cleaning my brushes so much
easier because what i was doing before
was using like a regular soap and mixing
in coconut oil it was taking me a long
time to prep cleaning my makeup brushes
and then obviously it took a long time
to clean the makeup brushes and this has
been a time saver because this is one
hundred percent natural it has it's made
with coconut oil and everything's
already in here I don't have to worry
about mixing any products this is you
know it's all in one so that has helped
so much but it is also very very quick
at cleaning makeup brushes especially
beauty sponges when i was using just a
bar of like dove soap i would have to
sit and scrub these sponges for so long
and I don't know what it is that's in
here or the ingredient that's making it
so fast
not take me as much time I mean my time
cleaning makeup sponges is at least cut
in half if not more that is how much of
a difference that I'm noticing including
my makeup sponges because I have to
clean my beauty blenders you know pretty
much every day because I use them
frequently and i only have like four so
i I'm just I'm super impressed with this
for the full-size bottle it's only
fifteen dollars which i think is a great
price and I mentioned this in my video
but obviously what we used to clean our
brushes is so important we have to have
a good makeup brush cleaning routine
because you're putting those brushes
back on your face and you know your
skincare routine is like number one and
having good makeup because you need a
good canvas to be able to apply your
makeup so brush cleaning super important
the cig magic brush shampoo is amazing i
also just wanted to throw in here I have
the Sigma expressive glove this was also
featured in the video but it has these
different like ridges and grooves on
here to help you wash the brushes this
is since I got this several several
months ago this is the only thing that I
will use to clean my makeup brushes like
beforehand I was literally just like
using the palm of my hand and it was
really disgusting and gross so I used
this every single time I clean my makeup
brushes and I'm so impressed with it so
like these two combined together like
the most magical thing ever so i'll
leave this link down below as well as
it's always a favorite of mine I know as
i mentioned in favorites videos in the
past but wanted to let you guys know
that i've been using this even more than
it from the original video that i posted
about it and still gets an a from me two
brushes both from sigma beauty that i
want to talk about they recently sent me
their baking and strobing brush set and
i have two brushes from there that i
just want to highlight reel quick
because i'm finding myself using them
nearly every single day i'm so so
impressed with them the first one is the
f 79 this is what it looks like and it
is the concealer blend kabuki brush so
impressed with this in my instagram body
makeup tutorial i used the baking and
strobing brushes and I meet it was like
this brush I know I'm gonna love this
brush but I'm obsessed with this brush
this is pretty much replaced my morphe
g24 blending out under eye concealer and
like nothing could replace on my g2 for
so long i love that bra
so it's actually super similar this is
the g2 from morphe and this is the sigma
brush so you can see it's very very
similar but this one is just a little
bit smaller so i feel like you can
really get in there and i love it for
that but I've actually found I was in a
wedding not too long ago and as I was
getting ready I realized that I didn't
have anything I forgot a Beauty Blender
amazing but i also forgot my brush that
I used to blend out cream contour and I
was like no I already had the cream
contour on my face and I was going
through my brush kit I'm like what what
what what do i do I grab this one out
and used it for cream contour and it
works amazing and I've done it before
even when i'm just sitting at home and i
have all my other brushes around me I've
used this and it works I'm like okay you
know dual purpose brush I like that but
the s79 has just impressed me so much I
reach for it all the time and then the
other one is the powder sweet but this
is the f 0 6 brush so it looks like this
so you know I use this to dust away like
the baking powder and that sort of thing
but I am also using it for contour I
really like it i think it was in my last
makeup tutorial that i use this for
contour because it's really like thin
precise so you can get right into the
contours of your face but at the same
time the bristles aren't too loose to
where you're kind of like losing it i
don't know i don't know how it works but
it's awesome so I found it really good
for that but I have also recently
started seeing that people are actually
using it for highlight too and I'm like
wait a second I want to try this for
highlight too so I don't know these two
brushes really stood out to me from that
collection especially because they can
do so many different items too so the f
79 and the FL six i will leave these
linked down below both from sigma beauty
awesome brushes if races that i want to
talk about is from bosha it's the
charcoal poor pudding intensive wash off
treatment stuff is so awesome this is
what the inside of it looks like you can
see like I've already made a pretty big
dent in it they apply this mostly in my
shower I usually do it about twice a
week I'll apply this all over my face
while in the shower and I just let it
sit for about like five or seven minutes
or so I'd say then I washed up in the
shower that's a two-part poor pudding
or buy black and white charcoal the
powerful pair work together to minimize
the appearance of pores while balancing
skin for ideal results so I've just been
loving it what I really like is that I
have sensitive skin so sometimes masks
can leave me kind of like irritate it
and really red and this does not do it
like even when I'm washing it off it
just feels very like smooth it's not
gritty and it's not like it doesn't
stick to your skin you know like some
masks you know stick and you really have
to like kind of scrub your face to get
it off this doesn't do that at all so
I've been really really impressed with
this so I've been using this space fully
two times a week every week for probably
the past month if not two months I just
throw it in my shower and when I have
with my conditioner on that's when I use
the mask and it works out really well
for me so pretty darn impressed with
this from boscia fully lined you guys
and one more favorite my bed but I
wanted to talk about this Smashbox photo
mat eyes palette I've just have been
using it so much lately I'm pretty sure
I featured in a favorites video like
shortly after i got it but i have been
using it so much lately is on my eyes
today i also used it in my werewolf
halloween tutorial so this is what the
inside looks like it does have this nice
mirror right here and that has all of
these different shades and you're
supposed to be able to use these as I
shadows as brow powder Santa's eyeliners
and I have shadows on and then my like
little eyeliner that I have to is from
this palette as well and it does come
with this double ended brush and I use
the liner side of it so often I use the
site as well but I used the liner side
very very often but I'm just continually
impressed with this palette when I got
it it was actually sent to be by
Smashbox and when I got it I was like
that's just a really neutral palette
like I can create three looks from it
and that's just not true there's such a
different combination and even though
it's like some of these browns might
look super similar to one another that
you're like are those the same shades
they are naps it's just crazy to me it's
crazy how different they can be even
though they do look really similar in
the palette they're also all very
pigmented but if you could tell from the
werewolf tutorial I was using the matte
black shadow and
there was no fallout you I mean I am
zoomed in on my eyes and you can see
there's no fallout from this palette
you're still getting really great
pigmentation without worrying about the
shadows falling all over your face and
that is really hard to achieve so I just
find myself reaching for this palette so
often have been so impressed with it but
especially after I did the werewolf
tutorial just really even more impressed
so the Smashbox matt is palette pretty
darn good the pointing products that I
need to talk about as well unfortunately
but does happen the first moment that I
want to talk about is the to face it
better than sex mascara the waterproof
version so i use the Too Faced better
than sex mascara the regular version all
of the time I love it it's a great
mascara every like I feel like everybody
loves it it's like a cult favorite and
when they came out with the waterproof
version there was like a ton of hype
around it everyone was like so excited
the packaging is really cool because it
has like actual like raised you know
like raindrops water drops on them and
you know the wand is the same as the
original Too Faced better than sex
mascara but I'm gonna love this I
received this in a box it might have
been the beautycon summer box maybe that
this was in but it came in one of like
the subscription boxes I was so excited
to get it and try it out i got like the
little deluxe i sample and i was so
disappointed in this i think i actually
used it in my first impressions tutorial
and i show you a close-up of just
minutes after I apply this mascara it
had already all fallen out like I had a
bunch of black mascara marks on my under
eyes because the mascara was flaking off
and I was like what and so I've used it
a couple more times just to see and it
does the same thing I don't get what I
don't get that with the regular better
than sex mascara so I don't know what it
is about this formula that makes it
flake off so much but it does so I just
you know I will not use that mascara for
that reason because I don't want to sit
there and look like a raccoon minutes
after I do my makeup I also i'm not sure
that i really think that's waterproof
because when i take this mascara off it
comes right off and mascara is kind of
hard to get off anyways waterproof
mascara
typically very hard to get off this
comes off with one swipe of a makeup pad
just and the mascaras gotten so Mike how
waterproof is this mascara I can't quite
figure that part out but I don't know me
and I was really I was really bummed out
about this one because I really wanted
to like it even though I'm like I don't
need waterproof mascara necessarily I've
got a big waterproof mascara kind of
girl usually because it's so hard to get
off but this one was just a total miss
for me and that really bummed me out
disappointing product for October is the
Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation so I
got this in my social a box I can leave
my unboxing down below but social ah is
a like subscription box service where
you can actually go on the website and
pick out products that you want to try
and they send you samples of it and it's
kind of like if you don't have like a
Sephora alta in your area you can go and
sample and swatch products you can get
it sent in the box and I thought it was
a really great idea I had so much fun
picking out the products because they're
all high-end and it was awesome to be
able to try things I loved the majority
of what came in the box but the Marc
Jacobs remarkable foundation even in the
video i wanted to stop filming so I was
like I look ridiculous I hate this
foundation and I was like you know what
you know maybe that was just a bad first
impression I'll try it again so I tried
it two more times just to make sure so i
could give an honest review and i still
do not like that foundation it is soul
full coverage but like like I like full
coverage foundations I think the clinic
beyond perfecting is a full coverage
foundation and I think it still looks
really nice the Marc Jacobs foundation
like suffocates my skin it feels heavy
it looks like I'm wearing foundation it
looks like i have cake face no matter i
was like you know what maybe i use too
much the first time because i read
reviews and people are like you really
do need a very small amount so i use
like the tiniest amount yes you still
get the coverage but it still looks like
you have cake face I'm like I don't
understand none of my other foundations
do this I'm not mixing up primers I'm
not mixing up how I apply it i'm not
doing anything different and this
foundation just looks terrible on me it
made my face just have like no life to
it just was like
and it just looked so bad it felt
uncomfortable my skin felt tight it just
it did not work out for me I think this
is a foundation like going through the
reviews and seeing other feedbacks like
you either love it or hate it there's
really no in-between for this and just
for those reasons that foundation did
not work out for me actually I have
thought about purchasing it at one point
when it first came out a lot of people
were talking about that and like the
primer that he came out with around the
same time or was something like that
like the coconut primer I thought about
purchasing those two together and it was
actually in mice for loves list for a
while so when I teamed up with social
wasps make that video I was like yeah
you know send me a sample that and I
mostly did it for a color match like
will this foundation color match me but
while i'm glad i did because that's an
expensive foundation and one that I just
really did not enjoy its be it for my
October favorites and some disappointing
products as well let me know what you
guys thought in the comments down below
