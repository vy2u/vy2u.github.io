is going to be my October beauty and
lifestyle favorites I just recently
posted the October book favorites for
the book portion of this channel so you
can check it out up here if you want to
see all of the book page from October
but this is going to be beauty and
lifestyle I just have a few things few
makeup products and then few random
lifestyle things as well so if you would
like to see a few of my favorites from
the past month please keep watch on the
first thing that I want to mention is a
book but it was not a book that was
mentioned in the October book favorites
because I don't typically post these
books on the chocolate plus page by
someone to talk about it because in
October my publishing company marching
Inc released a new book this is Perry in
progress and this is my cat lavoie and I
do have a full video that I put out the
day that it released just talking about
the book and my experience with
publishing in my experience with working
with cat with the books about who I
think should read it which is all of you
but yeah if you would watch that video
I'll link it up here in the description
box below yes this was definitely a
favorite this was the 12th book that my
publishing company put out so really
proud of it and we also have one
releasing November 11th 2 is on
pre-order right now it's called all i
want for christmas it is a collection of
holiday novellas including a book from a
novella from myself from cat and then
also to from Laura Chapman who is
another marching ink author she recently
released the full-length novel first and
goal so exciting news in the month of
October's I just wanted to share that
with you guys and then two other
lifestyle faves that I've been loving
right now like these are old-school but
man and it is just Jillian Michael
workout DVDs oh so it's been getting
colder I haven't been able to do as many
like walks with my dog in the summer we
would typically go like four miles a day
sometimes even more and it was just such
a good workout to get in that I tend to
cut back I still do yoga every day but I
would cut back on
the other workout DVDs just because you
know not only was i getting a workout in
but then I was taking so much can I am
to be able to go on these blocks but now
that it's getting colder we're not being
able to go for our walks as frequently
or as long that we have been so I've
been relying on my DVDs to still be able
to get my workout in and my favorite
ones from jillian is the 30 day shred
and then also her yoga meltdown DVD and
she I mean if you guys are not familiar
with jillian michaels she's known as
America's toughest trainer and she
really is and these videos are just
they're super hard i will say that they
are hard but they work so well when i do
the 30 day shred and do it for 30 days i
do a workout every single day for 30
days the results I mean are so so
noticeable so I've been slowly dabbling
in them like days that we can't go on a
block I'll do one or the other usually
I'll just pick whichever one I want to
do and do those but once we actually get
in like the midst of the winter when I
really can't get upset anymore then i'll
do a firm schedule and do the 30 day
shred add in some yoga the really good
part of these is that they have
different levels the 30 day shred i
believe has three levels so you can
choose which one you want to do it
starts with one it gets progressively
harder the yoga one has two different
levels that you can choose to do and
they also have like it's jillian and
then she has two girls doing the
workouts with her and one is like the
more beginner version and one is more
advanced so no matter who you are or
where at you can do these dvds you have
your options that can be shown you know
how to make it harder if a move is too
easy for you and how to make that move
easier if it's too hard for you but they
really do work the 30 day shred the
workouts are 20 minutes so it doesn't
take long but I mean it's intense like
you don't get a break you're constantly
doing something but it is only 20
minutes I think that's the same with the
yoga meltdown no it's 30 minutes so the
yoga meltdown is 30 minutes and it's not
just like yoga like it's yoga moves but
it's also a lot of cardio with him a lot
of strength with them a lot of holding
the poses for like 15 seconds
is very intense but if you're looking
for good workout especially like keep
you motivated in the winter I definitely
recommend checking out I have one
foundation that I want to talk about and
it is the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
foundation and I have it in the shade w5
sand beige warm warm sand beige this I
have have this for a while but I have so
many Maybelline foundations literally I
have the Maybelline better scan
foundation I have the maybelline fit me
matte and poreless i think i have two of
the regular maybelline fit me
foundations I just I love Maybelline but
especially their foundation but then I
also have this and I've been grabbing it
recently and I really I don't even know
why I lives just like well I'll just
wear my L'Oreal today and I put it on
and I'm like why do I know where those
more often it looks so beautiful and
especially I feel like now that it's for
getting into colder weather I feel like
my face like you can tell like I don't
feel like my skin looks as good I don't
feel like I have like luminosity to my
skin anymore and it's kind of bumming me
out I've been looking for products to
try to help that out I just got a facial
not too long ago as part of my wedding
anniversary present from my husband
because I've been complaining about my
skin and that sort of thing but this
definitely does help give you a glowy
look I'm sorry my dog is sitting right
next to me and she's whining I don't
know what's what's found you want say hi
to everyone maybe at the end you go say
hi okay I really do like this and it's
drugstore so it's affordable you can get
it I target at walgreens forever yeah
just been really really happy with this
one another product that i have is the
Knicks it's the micro brow pencil and
this is also its nick so it's drugs or
its affordable but it's just a good
eyebrow pencil and i believe it's
supposed to be like a dupe for the
anastasia pencil but it just has like
product at one end I have the shade and
blond and then it has this bully on the
other end I really like this guy's I'm
not someone who does my eyebrows every
day or even like every time I go out I
do have a May
lean um master brow drama i think it is
it's just a gel that sometimes I'll put
on my eyebrows but I have pretty thick
pretty full eyebrows as it is so I don't
feel that I always have the need to have
to do my eyebrows but when I want to
kind of like step up my game I've been
using this and it did take me out a few
tries to feel like I got it right just
because I've never done my eyebrows
before but now that I feel like I'm
getting the hang of it I really like it
and I do feel like I can tell a
difference in when I have the product on
to when I don't I just feel like my
whole face just kind of like looks
better almost like look it looks like
lifted or something I don't know I
really like it it's very affordable the
next micro brow pencil if you are
interested in getting into the eyebrow
game and I just have three makeup
brushes to talk about and we are done
but I recently just filmed my first
murphy hall and I also gave a brush
review and I have three of those brushes
that I want to talk about but have made
it into my favorites and it is the m4 39
foundation brush the g2 pointed buffer
and the m4 27 the duo blush brush so I
mentioned all these in my morphe video
and why I like them but the foundation
brush I just have been I mean I was
using it solely to like review it but
even now that kind of like the review
process is over I keep finding myself
reaching for it because it just is so
soft on your face it's so soft I just I
really like it morphy is very affordable
so be sure to check out that video
because I list all the prices in there I
have everything linked in that video and
I'll link everything in this video as
well but the other one was the g2 this
is the point at buffer and this is what
i use to buff out my under-eye concealer
and again souls often I really love how
soft these brushes are but I just think
it works so well I can really get it
around my hole I when I have my
concealer on my I to prime my eyes it's
so easy to use I like how it's pointed
there so I can help sharpen up the wing
if I need to I did not expect to like
the g2 as much as I
I thought it would be a brush that I may
be used sometimes but I use it every day
then the other one is the m4 27 this is
the dual blush brush this was one that i
mentioned in the video like when i first
got it I like my first impression was
that I didn't really love it and but
once I started using it I just love it I
especially love it for my color pop
blushes that have like the Moose e-type
consistency this works so so well with
them so easy to use I just have to do
one quick swoosh of my blush and put it
on and I mean this paired with the
colour-pop blush that stays all day it's
just like that's not with my October
beauty and lifestyle favorites i hope
you guys enjoyed that video if you did

thumbs up so i know that you enjoyed my
