today's video is going to be a full-face
elope you're using one brand and that
one brand is going to be a flower beauty
I am super excited to do this video
especially because it is in the
collaboration with flower beauty so a
huge thank you to them for sponsoring
this video for me and letting me try out
some of their makeup I'm going to show
you guys how it applies I've been using
this makeup for the past few weeks now
so I have some feedback on the products
that I'm going to share with you so that
is why I am bare face to them but put
some makeup on but before we get into it
I do want to say thank you so much for
clicking on this video if you do like
you're giving a videos on makeup and
beauty I am posting a video every single
day right now so I know that you will
consider hitting the subscribe button
for daily content but without further
ado when we go ahead and get started and
get some makeup on the space ok as you
get started I'm just gonna touch my ears
on real quick I already do have my face
Prime on when they didn't send over
their package it came in this bag which
I thought was really cool because I
actually don't have anything like it and
then this is all what's the inside of
the bag looks like so it has different
pouches and zippers and compartments
that you can put makeup in like for when
you're traveling which I thought this
was really cool I've never owned
anything like this but I've always
wanted something like it and I just
recently posted it what's in my travel
makeup bag and you saw that I always
have to take two bags with me so this
kook or even more so this could help me
out a lot and then it just kind of has
like a Velcro right here this bag is
only $17.49 I'll of course have to
flower beauty website listed down below
and then I'll link all the products that
I'm going to be putting on my face
flower beauty also they give me a
discount code for you guys it's just
samantha m15 is issue 15% off on their
website non affiliate code just a
discount code for you so that will also
be in the description box in case you do
find anything that you want I thought
this bag was very cool and I'm very
excited to try it out but the first
thing that I'm going to put on my face
is the foundation and they sent along a
stick foundation which had me really
excited because I actually want to do a
video soon all about my like best and
worst stick foundations so that adds
another one for the collection I was
like yes
is awesome so this is their stick
foundation the shade is an SS 3 and I
will say that the shade is a little too
light for me especially with it being
summer and I'm just outside a lot the
shade is too light for me at the time
vilifies you can see how it looks on my
face and even though the shade isn't
totally there I can still get a good
idea of the coverage and how I like the
foundation I've been wearing it often
the past couple weeks I know about the
long wear of it and all that fun stuff
so I'm going to go ahead and apply this
to my face so if you are not familiar
with a flower beauty is actually a
beauty brand asserted by actress drew
Barrymore which I thought it was very
very cool then like I mentioned earlier
they do have a huge line between makeup
accessories even fragrances now this is
what the stick foundation it looks like
so I do think that is very cool I'll
have all these social media links and
everything like that linked down below
I'm just going to go ahead and add a
couple swipes to my face to try to cover
up that angry breakout on my chin very
mad at me I did not get enough sleep
this past weekend when I was out of town
I'm just going to ask them to my face
what I noticed what mystic foundation is
that you don't need a ton like sometimes
the stick foundations you have to
basically cover your entire face with
the stick foundation in order to get any
sort of coverage that was one of the
first things I noticed with this guy and
also the stick foundation is only $11
1111 dollars that is not a bad price at
all happen to blend this out I'm going
to use their Beauty sponge and this guy
had me so excited because I've been
starting to see a ton of people talk
about this sponge and I'm like a lover
of makeup sponges I'm planning to do
also like my best and worst makeup
sponge video if you love makeup sponges
I feel like they make the skin look so
much more natural sometimes than a brush
cane they're just one of like my go-to
whenever I travel I always take a beauty
sponge with me as well so I was really
excited to give this one a try it's kind
of a light purple shade and it gets
quite large I mean you can tell it does
get pretty big and it is super super
soft I really am NOT a fan of hard
sponges that just feels like you're
boxing your face when you're using
and this one is very very soft I mean I
could tell even before I got it wet you
could tell that you can really squeeze
it and it's going to be nice and soft on
the face which I do appreciate the
blending sponge is only ten dollars and
this kind of a close-up of it so you
have like the regular bottom here but
then I like this part because it also
has a slope just on this one side which
I really like for concealer I think it
does a really good job lending in and
I've really been enjoying this makeup
sponge so one of the claims on the
foundation is that it's supposed to be a
weightless I would agree with that every
time that I've used it I haven't felt
like I have a heavy foundation on my
face I would say the coverage is about
light to medium which I do not mind as
well for the summer months I typically
and more medium light to medium I'm not
a full coverage foundation girl at all I
don't like the way full coverage looks
or feels on me so that is what I would
say for the foundation it is pretty good
at covering up everything and the long
wear of it I thought was really good as
well and able to wear all day even out
in the heat without having any sort of
problems I wore this foundation the day
that I went to the Botanical Gardens
actually in one of my blog it was a
hundred degrees that day and we did not
get any relief from being inside the
botanical garden it was so hot we were
like dripping in sweat and I was wearing
basically the entire lip I'm going to
show you today in this video I was
wearing in that video and everything
held up so well I was super impressed
super impressed so that was I mean I
didn't realize I don't think because I
work from home and I don't leave my
house a lot I don't think I realize how
hot it was that day I was like oh man I
probably should have implemented like
even more of my sweat proof makeup look
but everything held up really well so I
was really able to put this foundation
to the test like I said it's just a
little on the light side for me right
now with you being a little bit tanner
in the summertime but overall this
foundation has been working really well
for me and for only $11 I'm not mad at
all I love this sponge for the finish I
don't think it is a dewy foundation at
all but I don't think it's completely
mattifying I would say it would swing
more to the matte side but I just kind
of get a nice like kind of a satin
finish to the skin so that is what the
sound
looks like on me after foundation I'm
going to go ahead with some concealer
this is called their lighten up
brightening and concealer mine is in the
shade bc one which is the lightest shade
that they have and then when you open it
up this is what the applicator looks
like and then you actually just twist it
to get some product out so I'm just
going to apply this to my under eyes
really do not have to click up a lot
like when I first got it I remember like
kind of going crazy because I've had
concealers with applicators like this
before and you have to like spend all
day trying to get product out this
product comes out right away so I'm also
going to put it down the center of my
space and then I'm adding it to my
eyelids too as to work as my eyeshadow
primer and sealer is $9 and then I'm
going to go ahead and use my sponge and
I use the side that kind of sloped down
to blend it out for my eyeshadow I only
have one eyeshadow to use and when I
first was thinking about different looks
to do with the video I was like okay so
I own got one eyeshadow what else can I
do but then I went in and actually used
the eyeshadow they sent and I was like
ever mind
I like this just fine all on its own and
when I wore it I mean this was you know
a couple weeks back because it was the
day that I was going out to the
botanical garden so I've logged about it
and I was on my snapchat everybody was
saying you know how pretty my makeup was
and especially I kept getting so many
compliments on the eyeshadow and like
it's literally only one eyeshadow so I'm
super excited to show you so that's why
I'm doing my face first as I'm going in
with say a lot of eyeshadows or you know
shimmer shadows or sparkly
you know shadows anything where I might
get a lot fall out then I would do my
eyes first but since we're just working
with the one eye shadow I'm going to go
ahead and do some of my face here and
then switch to the eyes next next so the
concealer blends out super well the
light is almost like it's almost
slightly too light for me but I like
light under eyes not with my full face
using sample challenge because I was
like terrifying but this is just a tad
bit on the lighter side and what I would
normally do but I still think it works
out in the end and then especially when
I add like
bronzer and blush and you kind of tie
everything together and I think it looks
really well
super easy to blend out and like I said
I wore this in the 100 degree heat and
all I did that day was put like regular
setting powder on it I didn't even bake
or anything and it laughs in the heat so
well so I mean this this makeup from
fall our Beauty really got like a big
old test run from it the whole idea
behind a flower beauty when I was
researching at their brand is to have
you know high-end makeup put at more of
a drugstore price and again I'm naming
off the prices as they dull
I'll have everything in the description
box I'll put the prices in there along
with the link but you can tell these are
definitely drugstore prices and I've
just been very impressed with the
quality of everything that I've been
using so that is amazing and again they
did give me that 15% discount code as
well if you do want to purchase anything
from a flower beauty I'm just going to
go ahead and hit this with a setting
powder real quick and I'll move on to
the eyes so for the eyeshadows that they
sent along the business are endless wear
eye color this is what the packaging
looks like so really nice quality
packaging as well and it has a lot of
little flower level over here and then
when you open it up it has your little
protective guy and then this is what the
eye shadow looks like this one is in the
shade sheer sands and I'm just going to
go ahead and use my Sigma Y shading
brush it is the e55 I'm going to go
ahead and use this to apply it it's a
very like cushiony texture like a cream
eyeshadow the only thing that I'll say
about it is that I felt like I had to
take a little bit of time to filled it
up but it's honestly worth it because I
thought it was so so pretty and again
this is the only thing that I'm going to
use on my eyes no I'm not even use a
crease color which at first when I was
thing about this video I was like I have
to go in with a crease color like I just
have to those thing about going in with
the bronzer that they sent but when I
tried it out for the first time I was
like nope you actually don't need it it
is just that pretty a really beautiful
bronzy color which I absolutely love for
summer so much like I said I'm just
coming in and like working on building
it up but once we get to the final end
result it is really very gorgeous
our V website says these are supposed to
be 12-hour wear and I mean they were at
least that because the day I put it on I
mean I put it on before noon and we went
on our summer bucket list excursion and
is our night at McDonald's don't know
who did that definitely wasn't time I
wasn't mean a cheeseburger at 12:30 a.m.
but this eye shadow lost it really
really well and especially for not
realizing that I was going out in the
heat I think everything held up and this
eye shadow is included and go ahead here
and work on the second eye but I really
enjoyed this because it is so simple the
only thing again that I say is that it
just takes a little bit of time to build
it up but it's such a simple easy like
quick summer I love and I love this
bronzy shade it is my brows off-camera
and then I also put a little bit of
brown eyeliner into my waterline I'm
just going to take the same brush and
then the same eyeshadow and I'm going to
go ahead and just press this onto the
lower lash line just to add a little bit
of shimmer and color under there for
mascara I'm really excited to show you
this one because I have been loving it
this is called the zoom in ultimate
mascara so this is what the packaging
looks like but it is a mascara with a
twistable wand and then the wand gives
you different options so for example
this is what I have it on right now this
is really good to build a length and
then you just twist the bottom here and
your mascara wand transforms all are you
kidding me
so what you can do with it is that you
can get length you can twist it a little
bit to get your volume and then you can
twist it all the way until you can feel
it click and this is what is supposed to
help curl your lashes I think that wand
is so frickin cool so basically what I
do is I just start at the top I start
with the length I twist it a little bit
for the volume and then I twisted the
rest of the way for the curl so you get
a three in one mascara I think it's
super cool and I'm really into it I
definitely love the lengthening side
because I feel like I can really see
that I also only
a ten dollar mascara and to get the
three and one I just think is amazing I
think this is really unique I've been
really excited about this mascara and
really pumped to show you guys on camera
because I think it has been working so
so well and it's funny because I'm not
even a big mascara person to be honest
because I wear false lashes all the time
but I've been trying out some mascaras
recently that are just blowing me away
and this falls into that category I try
a zoom you in even more on to my eyes I
do not have long lashes and not blessed
with any sort of like pretty lashes or
anything that is one coat of mascara
using at the lengthening wand and then
I'm just going to go ahead and give it a
little twist and then this is what I use
for the volume and then here are the
lashes after the one coat with the
volumes now we have a total of two coats
on the lashes I just do one coat of each
and then I'm going to go ahead and twist
it all the way till it clicks so now
this is what the wand it looks like and
this is to help curl the lashes okay so
this is what the lash would look like in
comparison into no mascara this is what
the three coats of mascara lengthen
volume and curl I'm going to go ahead
work on the other eye just do the same
thing on twist the line goes back to the
first area like I said I've just been
really impressed with this mascara for
only $10 I think that's a great price
for what all you get with this mascara
also like I mentioned I was out in
100-degree Heat I had no mascara on my
face I was super impressed with how well
it held up in the heat it's definitely a
waterproof mascara and I haven't
mentioned this yet but just lower duty
is also a cruelty for you brand oh now
that the eyes are complete I'm going to
go ahead and finish off the face and I'm
going to use what I think is my favorite
product that was sent to me from flower
beauty and has just been like a staple
if you follow me on snapchat I've
already raised about it I've already
recommended it and I've already been
showing like how much I'm using it I
love this little guy this is their lift
in sculpt contouring palette so you have
a contour
bronzer shade a blush shade and then
also a gold highlight and I love all
three shades I love this guy this is $14
I think that is totally worth it for the
shades that you are giving and I have
just been completely obsessed with it so
first I'm going to go into the brother
shade I'm going to use my morphe Tartu
my big fat bronzer brush and just apply
this onto the face I think it is such a
beautiful color I've been obsessed with
this bronzer I think it goes on the face
so smoothly it's so easy to blend out
I've used it with all of my different
brushes and I've just been having a
great time with this bronzer so I'm
really going to take my time to build it
up because the foundation shade is a
little bit too light for me so I'm going
to go a bit heavy on the browser today
just so you guys know all the shades in
here - are super super pigmented like
even though I'm trying to build my
bronzer up if I was just to like jab my
brush in there it would be like crazy
crazy pigmented so for $14 you are
getting an extremely pigmented face
palette the blush and then even the
highlight I mean you'll see when I start
to apply them but man I love those guys
when I grab my Sigma f40 and I'm going
to dip into the blush shade and my
contour file that was sent to me is the
medium to deep they do have a few
different shade options as well I'm just
going to grab out the blush and apply
this to my cheeks like super I mean I'd
like and barely tapping my brush in
there and is it very very pigmented and
probably my favorite part is the
highlight so the highlight is such a
beautiful gold I'm going to use my Sigma
SL 3 of my favorite highlighting brushes
and go ahead and highlight my cheekbones
can you guys see that on camera
hopefully you can I did not use my ring
light today so I know sometimes people
say that ring light can wash it out and
it's nice and sunny day I'm right in
front of my window quested I'm not going
to use my ring lights because I really
want you guys to be able to see
everything just love this highlight it
excites me so much and this is a
beautiful gold look like I mentioned
they do have different shades of the
face palette so you can pick and choose
what palette it is that you want I love
the side
so much and again like I barely bit my
brush in there and look at what you are
getting from a $14 palette doesn't say
to me it really is you guys it's really
quite insane to me
and with our face complete the final
thing less of course is our lip color so
this is what I have is their long-wear
lip cream and this is in the shade dusty
rose so this is what the applicator
looks like and then you just squeeze it
up and the product comes out I
absolutely love this color it's a
beautiful deeper dusty rose nude plant a
lip cream it applies very easily even
though sometimes these applicators I
don't feel like are the easiest to work
with but I don't feel like I've had any
issue with this one I love the color
it's stunning super super pigmented even
you just got to squeeze out a very small
amount very creamy it glides across the
lips very easily and very very pigmented
so you do not need a lot of product and
then the lip creams are only nine
dollars which I don't think is a bad
price at all either the only thing that
I feel like I don't like about this is
that it has kind of a funky scent to me
I don't even honestly know how to
describe the scent I don't love the
scent but I can't smell it after I get
done putting it on my lips the scent
does fade away but like as I'm applying
it I'm like do not love that but I love
the pigmentation of it I love the color
of it I love this dusty rose color so
much if you're a new fan I think that
you would like it I do think it is a
long wearing it doesn't hold up super
well like while eating are things like
that but it's easy to reapply and then
just like drawing roll where I think it
does hold on to the lips very well so
after our lip color and then that is
going to do it for my full face using a
flower beauty so that's going to be
everything for my full face using a
flower beauty of products I really hope
that you guys enjoyed the look I still
have a bit zoomed in so you can see
everything on my face but I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video and
seeing the look that I created if I had
to pick a couple of my favorite items
okay love the beauty sponge I love it I
love it I think it is so good super soft
I really like it and for an affordable
makeup sponge if you're looking for a
good I wouldn't say it's a Beauty
Blender dupe because I don't
it's super similar to the Beautyblender
but if you don't want to pay the price
of the actual theory blunders which are
$20 you can do this as a more affordable
option I also really do enjoy the
lipstick I love the lip color I think
it's so pretty and I like how it's long
wearing if you don't love liquid
lipsticks you want a more comfortable
formula you could check out their lip
creams because I think they're really
good I've also been super impressed with
the mascara which really like blows me
away because how like I mentioned I'm
just not a big mascara person but I
thought this was really cool and I think
for only $10 so it's a really really
good praise for what you're getting and
of course my favorite the face palette I
love that I continually been reaching
for it and this was the first thing I
tried when I got my package from flower
beauty because I just love face palette
I love contour blush highlight I love
all of it so one of the first things I
tried and I was so excited and not to be
disappointed I was so excited to fall in
love with it if again if you follow me
on snap I've been recommending it for
the past couple weeks now and you see me
continually using it I've worn it in
several of my videos and I just I just
love it i think for $14 you can't go
