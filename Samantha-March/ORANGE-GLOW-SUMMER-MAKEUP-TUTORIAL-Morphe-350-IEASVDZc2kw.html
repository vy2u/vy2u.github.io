Oh
hi everyone thank you for watching so in
today's video is going to be a makeup
tutorial on this orange glow summer look
and I'm finally using my morphe 35o
palette that i recently purchased from
war p i was so excited i finally found
it back in stock one day and purchase it
and I'm so happy to have it i think it
is such a beautiful palette I've already
done so many looks with it just not
anything like on camera record it for a
tutorial so I figured it was about time
to do this I actually posted a look this
look on Instagram not too long ago and
so many people ask for a tutorial for it
and honestly is such a super easy look
that I just kind of was waiting to see
if I could come up with maybe something
a little bit more complicated but again
it's just two eyeshadows I mean this is
like my go-to simple look is just using
kind of a more dramatic shadow like how
i use this like orange coral and then I
really pretty softer color more towards
the inner part of the eyelids and put on
some big lashes and you're good to go so
I mean it's a pretty simple look and I
hope you guys enjoy it thank you so much

other looks that you'd like to see with
the 350 palette or certain shades in
