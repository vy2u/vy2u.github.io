today's video is going to be a little
bit different and I'm not really sure
about calling it yet but I wanted to
focus this video and give some product
recommendations on steps in the makeup
routine that I feel like we don't hear a
lot about when watching makeup tutorials
so I watch a lot of makeup tutorials I
recreate looks off YouTube tutorials all
of the time because I don't have a very
like artistically creative mind so I
love following tutorials and I feel like
it's so often that you hear oh I already
have my eyes primed so let's go in with
the shadows and I'm like well what eye
primer did you use what's your favorite
eye primer or you here you know oh I
just popped my lashes on what eyelash
adhesive did you use so I wanted to
focus this video and give a few product
recommendations on those types of items
so I'm gonna be talking about some of my
favorite eye primers also some of my
favorite lash adhesives and lash tools
for applying false lashes and then I
also did want to talk about some
eyeliners specifically eyeliners that I
use in my waterline I do have a favorite
liquid liner that I'll give a
recommendation to as well but even I'm
guilty of it I'll be doing like it get
ready with me or something on camera and
I'll say oh I just put some brown liner
in my waterline but I don't say what
eyeliner or what brand or anything like
that so I thought I could give some
eyeliner recommendations as well so
hopefully this video will be helpful if
you ever have these same questions like
I have before maybe you'll find some
product recommendations but if you would
like to see my recommendations for some
of these steps of why don't I go ahead
and get started first up I want to talk
about some eyeshadow primers I have four
here that I use the most and that I
would really recommend and this again is
just a stuff that I feel like a lot of
times when I'm watching tutorials
especially if they're just I to toriel's
you always kind of hear like oh my eyes
have already been primed let's start
with the shadows but I really do think
that I shadow primer is a really
important step and I wish more people
would mention the products that they
like to use you can definitely use a
concealer as an eye primer as well but a
lot of times I go in with my eyeshadows
first if there's days where I'm just
doing like a pretty simple look like
this one is I'll do my face first and
when I do my concealer I'll bring it up
into my eyelid and buff it out but when
I'm doing my eyes first I tend to do a
more traditional eye
one of my favorite eye primers and this
guy is only two dollars two dollars that
is from ELF and it's called like the
shadow lock eyelid primer I'll have
everything listed down below of course
but again it's two dollars and you can
find it on the alte website and this is
the one it looks like this with the
applicator looks like I really like this
because it has a really light almost
kind of like a salmon or peach tone to
it and I realize that I like that with
my eyelid primers because sometimes my
eyelids can have you know just a bit of
like redness to them or you can kind of
see some of the veins in there and I
feel like this helps with any like
discoloration on my eyelids kind of
takes that away I really like it for the
color with this one but I just like it
in general I think it's a really nice
eyelid primer and again for only two
dollars I don't even know why you
wouldn't have this in your collection I
think it's fantastic
I can tell mine is almost out and I
would definitely purchase another one
for sure next up I have this one here
from urban decay and this is the
eyeshadow primer potion this is an
original I know they have quite a few
options of these and I believe they're
about $22 I know that you can get mini
sizes as well so if you would want to
try it out and see if it would work for
you i that you could get a mini and see
if it does again this is what the
applicator looks like pretty similar to
that one from ELF and it's just nice you
can just run it over your eyelid and I
do like this one it says it's a
long-lasting eyeshadow base that's what
it says on the back and I feel like I
feel like I can notice a difference with
this one there are certain eye primers
that I've used that I'm like oh I don't
know but what this one I keep going back
to it because I feel like I can
definitely tell a difference fun that I
have here is a from Pierre this is the
get a grip endurance eyeshadow primer
this is probably the most different
eyeshadow primer that I have ever tried
and once I started trying it I was like
oh my goodness this stuff is in tense I
would definitely recommend this for you
know like if you are gonna have your eye
makeup on from like 8:00 in the morning
till like midnight if you're in a
wedding if you're doing makeup for a
wedding graduation I mean just when you
need your eyeshadow to stay in place all
day I would highly recommend this one
it's called the get a grip i primer and
it truly is like the most sticky
eyeshadow primer
I have ever
try so it just has a squeeze tube like
this that you would squeeze some of the
product out of and you need very little
product like when I squeeze it I squeeze
it so gently and I just get the smallest
bit on my brush and applied to my eyelid
because it really like just a small
amount goes a really long way but you
can tell as you're as you're spreading
it out on your eyelid it's really sticky
and really tacky and it really holds the
eyeshadows there but I still don't have
any sort of issues with like blending
the shadows or anything this one
definitely I feel like your eyeshadows
stick around all of the time so this is
a really nice one I believe it's 20
dollars and this I definitely recommend
for days where you need really
long-lasting eye makeup the last one I
have is one I kind of debated if I
should recommend this one but I really
really do like it it's just harder to
find and it is I think it's the most
expensive out of everything I'm talking
about but this is from Monika Darr it's
the step one prime I found it in an Ipsy
bag a while back and once I started
using it I was like the stuff is
freaking bomb but it's $24 so that's
definitely pretty pricey and I feel like
I think the only spot that you can get
it is on the Monica dart website maybe
Amazon if I can find a link I'll have it
down below and then you might be able to
if you still do get it see you might be
able to like find it on the IPPS EFC I
cancelled my Ipsy o algo so I don't get
it any longer but this is a really
really good I'm shadow base as well it's
a thicker eye primer and again you only
need a little bit of it it helps with
the discoloration on the eyelids and
it's also more sticky it's not quite as
intense as the pier one but it does give
a good kind of tacky base to the eyelid
as well and I just think it performs
really well again with these four that I
mentioned there's other eyeshadow
primers that I use and I notice with no
matter what action will palette I'm
using the shadows can kind of fade a
little bit quicker things like that or
they don't stick as well they don't hold
on as well to the eyelid primer or I
still have discoloration peeking through
throughout the shadows you know things
like that all four of these I feel like
my shadows go on really easily I feel
like my eyelids look prepped and ready
to go and I feel like my shadows stick
around for a while so these would be my
four favorite eyeshadow primers the neck
stuff I do want to talk about eyelash
I know not everybody wears a false
lashes but I get a ton of questions
about false lashes especially being what
lash adhesive do I use so I wanted to
focus on that for a second here I just
have three eyelash adhesives to
recommend and then I do have a tool as
well my all-time favorite lash adhesive
brands that I continually go back to and
I've been buying for years is duo you
can find these at the drugstore you can
also find them at Sephora randomly
enough but like I just bought this the
other day and I bought it from my CVS
you can find them at Ulta they're about
six dollars or so the dark one it comes
in a bigger tube and I've only ever
found the clear and a small tube does it
come in a big tube I don't know but like
the last one that I just used up with us
also know small tube
oh I don't know I like the dark tone and
then also be clear so the dark tone will
come out like a really dark grey and
then it will dry dark on the lashes the
clear this is called clear white it
comes out white but it will dry down
clear I didn't believe that for like the
longest time but it really does it does
dry down clear I don't suggest doing
just a white eyelash a piece of our
white eyelash glue because it will try
white on the eyelids and unless you have
like a white eyeliner on or a white
eyeshadow look it's gonna be really
noticeable I go for the dark tone when I
have liquid liner on my eyelid because
then it blends in with the black easier
because typically I'm using a black
liner it blends in with the black easier
or I can just go over the eyeliner with
it I tend to use the clear white when
I'm not wearing a liquid liner on my
eyelids I have no liner on but I just
want to really seamlessly blend in the
false lashes with my real lashes and
because this does dry clear then you
can't see any of that adhesive on the
eyelids so these are my all-time
favorites these are both brand-new
bottles this one I just bought a little
bit ago and I just finished up my dark
tone and again I just finished up my
clear white and I just bought this at
CVS like four days ago or something so
these are just my favorite I continually
go back to them and I would highly
recommend duo the other one that I would
recommend is from House of lashes and
this is their eyelash adhesive this one
is pretty different it is a brush style
applicator which sometimes a certain
lashes do better with a brush versus a
squeeze tube because I didn't show you
the duo ones but these are
just a squeeze tube like this so the
House of lashes is a brush with
sometimes it's easier if you have lashes
that have an extremely thin band like
the morphe lashes their band is so thin
but it's kind of hard to squeeze
adhesive onto it because the fan is so
thin the adhesive slides off that band
so that's when I come in with the house
of lashes adhesive because I can brush
it on there and it stays put easier if
that makes sense
but the House of lashes eyelash adhesive
is super super sticky and your lashes
they're there they're not going anywhere
but which is great you know like that's
great you want your lashes to stay there
you don't want your lashes falling off
and like the middle of a party or
something but at night it's still really
hard to get your lashes off and the lash
adhesive sticks around on your eyelashes
for like three days
so there's definitely pros and cons to
it I don't have problems with my
eyelashes not sticking when I use the
duo but that it's also really easy to
get all of the enemies of off which yes
like your lashes stick around for a
really long time so again if it's one of
those days where I know I'm gonna be
gone for a really long time I do like to
use the House of lashes eyelash adhesive
but at the same time I use it pretty
sparingly because then I can't get it
off of my eyelashes and it drives me
crazy and instead of just being able to
peel my lashes off at night I actually
have to put makeup remover onto a pad
and then let it sit on my eye kind of
like how I remove glitter I let it sit
on my eyes so to my eyes and my eye and
then I can finally take the eyelash away
it just takes it takes an extra amount
of time when taking my makeup off but
this is still a good eyelash adhesive I
just did want to give the pros and cons
to it but I've been through a couple
bottles of the House of lashes lash glue
as well again really good for sticking
around just not so great because then it
sticks around again but those are my
three favorite eyelash adhesives for
actually applying eyelashes I recommend
using some sort of tool this one here is
from Tarte and I don't even know what
it's called the TARDIS lash something
tool I don't know I'll link it down
below it's pretty pricey I think it's
like $24 but this is something that you
don't really have to replace once you
have the tool you have the tool you're
not going to run out of it kind of thing
so I don't I don't mind
investing more money in it because once
I got this it really did help you know
you don't need to only do this one from
tarp but just really anything that you
can find that has this kind of like flat
lay right here versus the tweezers I use
soap on my lashes with tweezers but it's
kind of scary because they're typically
more pointed at the end and that can be
kind of scary going towards your eyes
with them this one you can put the
lashes flax into the lash applicator and
just set it onto your lashes much easier
so I think I've seen like drugstore
brands have one of these as well just
anything that has these flat edges I
highly would recommend because that's
gonna make it much easier to apply the
lash on to your lashes instead of using
a tweezers or using your fingers and
kind of getting it like cooped up in
there I recommend having a tool such as
this so I'll have this one linked down
below and if I can find other ones as
well that I think are comparable
comparable I will have that in the
description box also but I think having
a eyelash tool is so much easier than
not having one or using like a really
pokey tweezers I also broken my lashes
with really pointy tweezers I've grabbed
him by the middle and literally snip the
lash right in half because my tweezers
were so shy so those are a few tips of
mine and favorite products for applying
false lashes so next up I'm just gonna
quickly run through my eyeliners I know
this looks like a lot but it's mostly
the same brands nothing too crazy and
but again I feel like eyeliners
especially for the waterline are really
overlooked maybe that's what I could
call this you look at this idea last
night I was filming something entirely
different this morning and then I was
like I really want to film that one I
think that sounds like fun hopefully
some people find this helpful but again
this is one that I feel like nobody
really talks about their waterline eye
pencils I definitely feel like you know
the eyeliners to make a winged and
liquid liners and gel liners and things
like that I feel like those get more
attention than just like regular pencil
liners for the waterline but I do it too
and I get frustrated with myself when I
realize I'm doing it because I love
eyeliner eyeliner is kind of one of
those things that I've never left my
house without I mean from all the way
back in my college days I loved my
eyeliners I especially loved blue
eyeliner in college don't ask me why but
that was my go-to but I just I really
enjoy eyeliner so I wanted to give a few
of my recommendations one pencil that I
have been using a for years and years is
from Rimmel and this is called the let
me tell you the exaggerate exaggerate
waterproof eyeliner I have mine in the
shade in the nude which is just a really
nice nude beige eyeliner it's actually
what I have in my waterline right now I
love having a nude liner on hand because
it's something that helps really open up
the eyes times this is what I like to
use in the morning are when I'm doing a
more simple makeup look and I just want
my eyes look really fresh and awake
I'll reach for a nude liner and this one
from Rimmel has been in my collection
for many many years the next one I
actually just mentioned this in my brand
recommendations video that I did with my
gift card guide video which I'll have
down below this is from Pierre and this
is the on point eyeliner one of my
favorite liners hands down I mean that's
the same with all of these eyeliners but
really this eyeliner I think it's really
freaking cool and special and I just
like to recommend it as often as I can
and I want to get some more shades for
myself I have the one in brown which is
called down-to-earth I believe yes
down-to-earth I really like using Brown
in my waterline because I feel like it's
just a little bit softer than a black
unless I'm doing you know a smoky look
or a more dramatic look than I like to
use black but typically I prefer brown
in my waterline
this one is really creamy it doesn't tug
it all on the waterline I hate having to
constantly be swiping the pencil back
and forth on my waterline I hate having
to like press really hard I just need
something that's creamy and easy to
apply and definitely this Pier one is
but I also really like it because it is
self sharpening so when you put the cap
on it's not just like a cap you actually
twist it and when you twist it it's
sharpening the pencil so you always have
an on point eyeliner which I love about
this one I think it's fantastic it's $19
you can find these at Ulta as well and I
think they're wonderful I definitely
want some more shades because if I want
to recommend some from Urban Decay I
actually mentioned this in my makeup
monthly fairly recently in my favorite
section I know this is not a newer
product but it's newer ish to me and I
really like these ones from Urban Decay
the 24/7 glide-on eye liners I have two
different ones here I got this black one
in the mini size I think in like a like
a Sephora favorites type of set and I
really enjoy it and then I also got one
sent to me a full size sent to me from
Urban Decay in a PR package so the black
is called perversion and then the blue
that I have is in deep end which is a
really nice teal but again these are
really nice and
like the name suggests it's a very easy
glide on pencil very creamy goes on very
very smoothly and they're also highly
pigmented both the black and the blue
that I've tried have been very pigmented
and they stick around for a very long
time which is awesome these at 24/7
glide-on pencils are from Urban Decay I
think they're $20 and I think they're
fantastic one of my absolute favorite
eyeliners and if you've been watching
for a while you probably know that I'm
going to talk about the Marc Jacobs
highliners I really enjoy these they're
some of my favorite eyeliners but
they're also super pricey at $25 each I
think every time I've bought a Marc
Jacobs Highliner I've purchased it
during a VIP so because it's just really
hard to spend $25 on an eyeliner I'm
someone who loves eyeliner and I wear
eyeliner on a daily freaking basis like
you don't catch me without my eyeliner
it's still it's hard to pay $25 for that
so you can see I have quite a few shades
here some of my favorites this one in
over which is a really nice green and I
have green eyes and I just feel like
something with the green and the green
liner I just love it like a forest green
which i think is really beautiful and
then also this is another one that's
kind of similar to the Marc Jacobs one
or the I'm sorry 2k 1 this is Odyssey
which is a really nice teal I really do
like the highliners I would recommend
them again they're very creamy they
glide on very easily and they stay this
I think might be my longest lasting
eyeliner which is why I absolutely love
it I don't have to worry about touching
it up it's kind of one of those
eyeliners that when I do remove my
makeup I kind of have to take a extra
second and kind of do one of these and
rub the makeup remover on my waterline
to actually remove it because it sticks
around for a very long time so it is
pricey but I do think that they are
really quality eyeliners but I still
would suggest getting them at some sort
of discount but I do really enjoyed
these the last one I wanted to touch on
is a liquid liner like I said I feel
like liquid liners and gel liners they
get mentioned more when people do like
winged liner tutorials and things like
that but I wanted to mention this one
because I definitely don't feel like
anybody talks about it and this is my
number one go-to liquid liner and it's
kind of random but I love this liner and
when you see me have a wing I always
link my makeup in description box you
typically always see this one linked out
from DHC and it's there liquid eyeliner
I find these on Amazon
I don't even this is at least my second
one if not my third I have a backup in
my drawer I found this because I got
sent some of their skin care once to
review and they included a few extras in
there and one was this eyeliner pen and
I remember running out of mine and being
like I don't really want to go buy
another one because I hadn't really
found like an absolute favorite
must-have liquid liner of pencil yet and
so I grabbed this one out and I was like
wait a second what what this is just my
favorite it's just my favorite and this
is what it looks like it has a nice a
nice a short point on there it's super
black it's super easy to apply it sticks
around forever it's just it's one of
those things that makes it so easy for
me to do a wing and this is just my
go-to winged liner pencil so I thought I
would mention it because it's DHC is a
k-beauty skincare brand but they do have
makeup products as well again like I
said you can get it from their website
or I have gotten my last eyeliners off
of Amazon it's about $20 but it's my
absolute favorite liquid liner so I
thought I would mention that but those
are some of my favorite eyeliners that I
would recommend are you guys so that's
gonna do it for today's video and if
some of my favorite overlooked makeup
products I liked that I thought a little
bit earlier I think that's one I am
going to call this video maybe will say
but I hope that you guys enjoyed this or
found it helpful in some way let me know
if you feel like there are other kind of
these overlooked makeup categories and
you would like to see product
recommendations from them because I'd be
really happy to do that just like I said
I follow youtube tutorials all the time
and sometimes I can definitely get
frustrated when people just skip over
certain parts and I'm like what's your
favorite what did you use to apply that
with you know things like that so let me
know if there's any other categories you
would like to see but of course if you
guys did find this video helpful or
entertaining in some way I hope that
you'll give it a thumbs up I hope that
you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I'll catch you guys in
at tomorrow's video right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
