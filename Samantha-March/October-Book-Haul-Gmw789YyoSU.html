today hopefully quite well today's video
is going to be a new book haul I'm going
to be sharing I have quite a few books
to share with you that i have been sent
from publishers authors la tour
companies etc so we have quite a bit to
talk about so why don't we just tell
right y'all hopping into it the first
one I have received is put a ring on it
and this is by Beth Kendrick Beth is
like on my list of top authors I don't
miss any of her books absolutely loved
reading my surface wants to restart I
swear every time that I need to use my
surface to film these YouTube videos I
start and it's like Oh restart but now
i'm going to try to hurry because when
it says it needs to restart it'll just
it'll just choose the time to restart
and it won't give me any warning but
anyways put a ring on it by Beth
Kendrick this is in the black dog by
novel I believe okay let me let me say
this correctly cure for the common
breakup and new uses for old boyfriends
are both the part of the series as well
I have reviewed both I will leave links
to my reviews in the description box
below as well as the amazon link for
this one i love the black dog bite
series i highly recommend both Kendrick
I'm so happy that I got this one to
review the next one that i have is
Christmas at cranberry cottage and this
is by tally rollin and slowly the
Christmas and the holiday novellas and
series collections etc are starting to
roll in and it's kind of been kinda gets
you in the mood a little bit early but
again kelly rowland from the very
beginning of her writing career i have
like been with her i think i've read and
reviewed nearly everything if not
everything from tally she's such a
fabulous writer she's great at Chiclets
she has a lot of novellas she kinda
reminds me of how I spoke about Michelle
Gorman a few weeks ago and how it was
the curvy girls baby club that I was
talking about I mentioned that Michelle
has a lot of books out there a lot of
full lengths but also a lot of novellas
kali is the same way she always has
something come out during the holiday
season i love it i will try to find I
mean I will have so many revealing
her but I'll try to pick a few of my
favorite to put in the description box
below as well with the Amazon link to
Christmas at creamery cottage I believe
this is a novella it says it's only 30
only 32 pages on amazon and it is only
at 99 cent to purchase another one that
i received is clutch by lisa becker and
i received this one with CLP blog tours
and i have read lisa becker as well she
has written click and double click and
those are books that were written like
all via social media emails statuses
things like that which might not sound
super appealing in the beginning like
we're not thinking about it I'm like how
am I going to be able to read this as a
story but actually ended up loving them
so I'm really excited to read this one
it says this novel is the laugh out loud
Chiclets romance chronicling the dating
misadventures of carolyn johnson a
single purses Einar who compares her
unsuccessful romantic relationships to
styles of handbags the hobo starving
artist the diaper bag single dad the
briefcase intense businessman etc so
again I feel like this is going to be
another one that is going to make me
laugh and enjoy from Lisa Becker so i'll
put the links to click and double click
below double click did I say clink
double clink I'll put those in the
description box below and the Amazon
link for clutch I have is running with
knives and this is by Michelle buca
maybe I'm saying that right and let's
see Michelle is how did I get this but
all this was sent to me by Michelle she
contacted me about reviewing the book
for her and sent me the Kindle copy on
Amazon it says to get to happily ever
after sometimes you need to start from
scratch looks like we follow successful
caterer Holly who's known for her
birthday cakes but lately her love life
isn't so sweet her daughter goes off to
college and Holly realizes somewhere
along the way she's lost touch with a
spontaneous young woman she used to be
and it says on the worst day of her life
it hits her that she once had big dreams
too if only she can member what they
were and find the girl within herself
who was still brave enough to try mmm so
it sounds like maybe it's going to
a little bit of a foodie book to not
like foodie books when I have is afraid
of her shadow and this is by Carol
Maloney Scott this one was also sent to
me by the author Carol so thank you so
much it says this is a romantic comedy
and it's in the series rom con on the
edge and this is book to book one is
there are no men which I believe was
reviewed on chocolate plus i don't think
i reviewed it though there are no men i
will find the link and put that in the
description box below that i'm pretty
sure i was not the one who reviewed that
one but i decided to take this one on
because it sounded good to me it says on
amazon 40-something self-proclaimed
cougar we follow Rebecca who has
committed only to her captain her career
her veteran single lifestyle has been
peaceful and happy that is until she
started dating age-appropriate Steve an
entomology professor with a sweet smile
in a demeanor to match who knew in Psych
science could be so appealing looks like
steve is a widower and has a lot of
baggage memories of his late wife Phil
his home she's kind of creeped out by
all his creepy crawlies okay I get that
it says rebecca faces the commitment
phobia by moving in with steve was
behaving more like crows a new friends
than her level head itself she burns her
but it's tanning salon crashes on energy
drinks and even loses a hamster well
throw into the mix a few delusional
relatives a sarcastic teenager and a
fluffy dog who sheds a new dog every day
and Rebecca doesn't recognize her to
hope self and it says and if that isn't
enough to push her over the edge her
smokin hot ex returns reminding her of a
simpler time with a married with a man
who carries no more baggage than a
wallet book to it is a standalone novel
so that's why I knew that even though I
hadn't or the first book I'd be okay to
read this one but it says it's a
continuation of the wacky and relatable
saga of the ladies of Ron con on the
edge rom-com on the edge a print book
that was sent to me and this is too many
cooks and this is by Dana Bates and
let's Amin obviously if you can tell
from the cover that is probably gonna be
a foodie book which I say so many times
I love them even though even though I
can't cook I just recently had my author
from marching ankle
Chapman she asked me to do a guest blog
on her blog about she has like a friday
night eats blog going on which I will
link below because if you need recipes
especially like game day recipes things
like that you have to check out these
recipes because they're awesome I keep
forwarding them to my husband like right
what about this one but she asked me to
write one for her and I was like can I
ask my husband to give you the recipe
and I'll write it like I'll take his
recipe and what he does and I'll do a
write-up for you and submit it and she
said yes so I did and I basically just
say in the article that I'm a nun
domestic goddess I can't help it I admit
it I freely admit it even though I love
food ebooks makes no sense but i'll link
Mitch's recipe below if you guys want to
check it out as well as the friday night
eats cuz she's got some good stuff in
there but this is too many cooks it says
in this hilarious insightful new novel
from the author of a second bite at the
Apple a cookbook ghostwriter finds that
she's bitten off more than she can chew
well that sounds like a lot of fun right
there and this was sent to me by
kensington books so thank you so much
kensington for this one this is my a RC
copy and this book does it tell me on
here when it comes out um it releases in
november of 2015 so i'm sure it's on
pre-order on amazon so i'll list the
creek oh darling but that is my latest
book haul i hope you enjoyed those books
not sure exactly how many we had in
there but i'm very excited to give these
all a read in the coming weeks and
months i think all of these reviews
should be running on chuckle applause
probably in the November area maybe some
in early December but most should be in
November so again check the description
box below if any of these caught your
eye I will have their amazon links below
for you for you to check out the only
other thing that i have to say is that
CLP six years is still running we are
still in October people so we are still
celebrating Chiclets plus turning six
this month what I have going on right
now is a book giveaway for a signed copy
of my latest book up to i do it is a
chiclet
novel and i will leave the link to the
giveaway below for that but basically I
wanted to Center it around like my
snapchat family because they are so new
to me I just recently got the snapchat
app for my business side of things I
have a personal one but then I decided
to get more of like my books and beauty
one out there and I just have a great
time the snaps that I get are so it's so
fun to be able to interact with you guys
on another level I think that's really
neat um so I'm just really enjoying it
so I wanted to be able to give them some
sort of give away but then also here on
YouTube as well and then I you know
obviously I don't want to leave out my
other social medias but the idea started
with somehow incorporating my snapchat
family in do that so that's kind of
where the giveaway started so you get

subscribing here on YouTube and
commenting on my up to I do video that I
made a few months ago and then also

the three main things that you can do
