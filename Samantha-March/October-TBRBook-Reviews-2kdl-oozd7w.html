is going to be all about book reviews
and these are going to be all of the
book reviews for the books that I read
and reviewed on to clip+ for october so
it's different from the favorites where
i talk about all the books that got five
stars between myself and my review team
on chocolate plus these are just going
to be any book that i read in october
and reviewed on chocolate plus so some
that i mentioned will be the five-star
book so i won't really get into those
because you can just watch the favorites
video if you want to see those reviews
but i'll just be sharing my october
reading list and what I thought of all
the books that I read so if you would
like to see what i have been reading
then please keep watching this stuff is
if you only knew and this is by kristan
higgins and I did give it five stars but
I also did a full video review on the
book because it's one I listen to an
audio and I just thought it was so
amazing and I've noticed I've started
doing a lot of my audio books that I've
chosen I'm starting to do the full video
reviews forum so I have a video review
on if you only knew and once the only
book that I talk about in that video so
I go pretty in-depth into the book but I
did give it five stars i will put linked
up here and in the description box below
i'll put the link to that direct video
if you guys want to see my review on
that but absolutely love it and
definitely recommend the next one that i
have is extreme and measures and this is
by Mickie Jay Corrigan and I think this
is the second book that I read by Mickey
and I have enjoyed both of them i
believe red hot blues was the other one
that i have read so i can leave my
review on chocolate plus below i will
leave in the description box below all
of the amazon links to the books that
I'm talking about plus the reviews on
chocolate plus that I did if you want to
check out either of those yeah this is
my second one by McGee and basically I
thought was interesting because we
follow Vanna dream like her last name is
T r.e.m e so that's like the ex dream
measures play on the name you get it
what we follow her and she's basically
like a private detective that looks into
light
cheating husbands and that sort of thing
but then she will take it an extra step
and kill them for you if you want them
to die great but I thought I was really
interesting I seriously the whole book I
was very invested in it because it I
mean I don't want to say that it was
unique because I mean this this happens
has been written about before but I
loved the writing style it was very
catchy it was very fast paced it was
easy to fall into vanna's life and see
how it all works and of course there's
you know a lot more going on than just
her job there's you know kind of a
romance with one of her associates and
then she's got an ex-husband who needs a
lot of help who keeps hanging around and
then the ending actually took like a
very Swift left I thought and we went
into like a whole other realm of where I
did not expect the ending to be like
what it was but it was very interesting
i gave it a 4 star review on chocolate
plus and i had a really good time
reading it the next one i have is the
truth about Carolyn and this is by Randy
and the Sherman and this one was one
that sometimes when it comes to Kindle
books I forget to read the blurb before
I start actually reading the book you
know it was like paperbacks and
hardcovers I just look on the back cover
and I read what the book is going to be
about then I start the book and with
Kindles I you know sometimes sometimes
authors do put in the beginning their
blurb right there so people can read it
and some authors don't and a lot of
times with others that don't put the
blurb in there I simply just forget to
go look on amazon and so then I start
reading and sometimes I get surprised by
what I'm reading and this was one of
those books I I don't know what I mean I
literally went into it with no
expectations I just started reading it
and seeing where we would go with it
turns out Carolyn is in jail she is in
jail for like a murderer to hire on her
husband her husband was murdered by like
a prostitute and like he gets murdered
and then it was like years later that
the prostitute says that she was
actually hired by the wife to kill
so she was just following the order
something Carolyn gets arrested and is
in jail eventually she does get out she
does have two older daughters who try to
help her like get back into life after
prison and that sort of thing and she
manages to get a new job and the whole
thing with Carolyn and why the book is
called the truth about caroline is that
she lies a lot she's very manipulative
um she's very dishonest yes she lies a
lot but she can like she justifies
everything to herself like she knows why
she's lying and you know it's okay
because of this reason it's okay because
of that reason so she eventually gets a
job by lying on her application you know
having a new name because obviously like
she's gonna have a lot of trouble
getting a job that she was in prison
even though she got off she still was in
prison for murdering your husband oh so
she's having troubles getting a job she
gets one by lying and then I want it
like I literally want to tell you guys
the whole bug least I had so much fun
reading it but the ending was like wow
what is happening and there's a whole
scheme involved with her work and that
she's involved in and then like the very
last page I was just like that did not
just happen right I mean it was a lot of
fun to read I gave it four stars on
chocolate plus i highly recommend that
you check this one out the whole first
half of the book is like her trial and
her at court and I like for some reason
I just found that absolutely fascinating
I'm not like a big court person I don't
watch my mom watches all these trials
and stuff on TV I don't usually do that
but I just had a great time reading
about it and of course it was funny at
the same time but then when we move into
the second half of the book and she's
out and she's trying to get
re-established and then we kind of
realized that there's probably something
funny happening with this job what we
keep reading and then of course the
ending happens and I was just like
spot-on I like it the next one I have to
talk about is copy girl and this is
written by Anna Mitchell and michelle
fafsa
Matt told sheriff I'm pronouncing that
right when I was really excited to get
copy girl mostly because like first
glance I see a pink book I'm like yes
and it's about you know like a working
woman trying to make her way up and I'm
like yes i love that it was kind of
what's it say madmen Meets The Devil
Wears Prada in this lively debut about a
young woman working at the hippest ad
agency in New York and I was like yes
this has my name written all over it i
was so excited to get it i I did give it
four stars on chocolate plus i will say
that that i ended up really enjoying it
but the beginning was just like so slow
to me that i really had a hard time
getting into it and like getting excited
for it and knowing that I was about to
pick it up again I was kind of like uh
when is it gonna pick up like one of the
action gonna start when when am I gonna
like feel that connection like I felt
like I had a really hard time connecting
with the main character which to me was
confusing because we were kind of like
the same age and I could kind of see
some of our own like ambitions in each
other and I'm like so why what's what's
happening here why am I not connecting
but definitely I would say like the last
third of the book especially really
picked up for me I was really excited to
read it I didn't want to put it down
towards the end it just that's when I
got really good to me so i will say slow
start so if you do read it and you're
finding yourself like struggling along
in the beginning I do say you know try
to keep going and hold off because the
end it does get really good so four
stars alright the next one I have is
pieces of it all and this is by Tracy
Cromer and I did give this one a five
star so again my October favorites video
will be linked in the description box
below so if you want to see all those
five star books including pieces of it
all please watch that video this one is
a new adult book and I'm just been been
becoming a huge fan of Tracy creamer
this is the third book I've read by her
and I've absolutely enjoyed everything
I've given all three of her books that
I've read five stars so definitely an
author to check out her first two that
I've read are more like Chiclets women's
fiction and then pieces of it all was
new adults but i will leave the amazon
links below and then all of my reviews
on Chiclets plus for her books those
will be linked below as well
okay and then the last book that I read
and reviewed in October was too many
cooks and this is by Dana bait and I
feel like I'm like sliding off my chair
I'm wearing these like really crazy yoga
leggings and they're really kind of like
slippery and I'm on like a wooden chair
and every time I move I feel like I'm
gonna like fruit slowed right off that'd
be embarrassing but this is too many
cooks by Dana bait again I was really
excited to get a copy of this book
because it's like foodie fiction and i
just love booty fiction I've talked
about it and so many my videos and I
thought the cover was so cute we got the
eggs and the timer and you know whatever
that is I don't know I was like flower I
don't actually know how to cook myself
so I don't really understand why i like
food ebooks so much but this one was it
was almost kind of similar to copy girl
where the beginning I just was kind of
like what are we doing when's when's the
action coming I did give it four stars
on Chiklis because again similar to copy
girl it picked up at the end the end
result was so exciting and I felt like I
was like holding my breath the points I
was like oh it's gonna have been ducks
what's gonna happen next but basically
we follow kelly and she has recently
lost her mom and she finds a letter from
her mom that she wrote when she knew
that she was going to be passing so she
wrote it to Kelly and basically told
kelly like you need to get out there you
need to be more ambitious you need to
live your life kind of put down the guy
that Kelly was seeing you know calling
him like boring stable you know all
those things and she was just telling
kelly like you just need to get out
there really do something and a like
just after that kelly gets a job
opportunity to be able to go to London
and to ghostwrite a copy copy book to
ghost write a cookbook with a like
famous actress so this actress is
Natasha Spencer and she seems like great
and wonderful you know it you know I'm
like TV and in the movies and stuff she
seems like she'd be
a really cool person and when Kelly
drops everything you know basically
breaks up with this man that she's been
with for years and goes to London to try
to pursue this she realizes that you
know it's probably not going to be as
great as it seems natasha is natasha is
the celebrity that I feel like a lot of
us probably think what celebrities are
like rude and just like disrespectful
and not down to earth at all like they
have no idea how the real people live
like that is who natasha is and she
treats Kelly so terribly and she's just
a very unlikable character but Kelly's
trying her hardest to help her write
this cookbook and there's a lot of flaws
along the way and a lot of setbacks etc
but then it really starts to pick up
when Kelly starts a romance over in
London and I really don't want to say
too much even though I don't really
think it would be a spoiler but she
starts a romance that she shouldn't and
everything kind of spirals downward and
out of her control from there and at the
end I kind of get worried for like is
she gonna be okay she gonna be able to
make it work and I I truly did enjoy the
ending but like i said the beginning was
just a little bit too slow for me and it
took me a while to read i think because
like this is the pretty it's a fairly
big book but honestly like the type I
just thought like the type was so small
like when I opened it I was like oh boy
and then you know when when the
beginning didn't really like kick off
for me right away I was like who does
could take a while it did take me a few
you know extra days to read than what I
might normally read a book in but I'm
really glad that I stuck out with it
because the ending I really did enjoy i
like to getting little like recipes and
like secrets to cooking along the way
even though i know that i would never
use anything like that ever it was still
a lot of fun to be able to breathe so
again similar to copy girl if you guys
do want to pick it up and read it and
you're kind of struggling in the
beginning I do say hold on because I
think you guys will really
like bending so again I gave that one
for that was my October reading lists

suggestions that you want to see again
just comment below and let me know of
course i'll be doing the halls for you
reviews for you favorites for you I do
have one video that I'm doing this month
I believe I'm going to do my like
one-on-one book review video is going to

I just recently finished that one on
audio so that review will be coming but
if there's any other books that you want
me to read and review or mention or find
out about you know just just comment
below and let me know I do have a
giveaway coming for you guys in December
which I'm really excited for so be sure
to stay tuned for that subscribe if you
have not because it will of course be
for my subscribers I do actually just
want to mention this real quick I just
got my first like affiliate code I guess
you'd call it and that will be in the
description box below now but it's
actually for like shampoo and
conditioner a while back I got sent a
shampoo and conditioner from parody or I
think is what it's called pura d'Or and
they sent me a shampoo and conditioner I
ended up loving it I mentioned it my
favorites video I use it all the time I
was just so very impressed with it and I
just was talking about it in a lot of
places and they asked me if I would like
a discount code for my subscribers and
followers and I was like yeah so check
that out that's below um because it
actually is for a like subscription club
or something like that it's called
two-minute club basically you join it's
just like with subscription boxes or
what not you you'll get shampoo and
conditioner delivered to you like on a
schedule you can pick what you want your
schedule to be but then instead of
having to worry about buying or ordering
or going out shopping it just get
delivers to which however many months
you want it to be delivered and then so
if you sign up with the link that is
below you have to go through that link
you place your first order and then when
you go to place your second order you'll
get twenty dollars off and then they
told me that if you like on your second
order say you only spend $15 when you go
to use your third order you'll still get
another five dollars off because your
second order would be totally free
because you didn't use your twenty
dollars and then your third order you
would still get another five dollars off
to equal your twenty dollars I hope that
I'll make sense I mean everything is
linked below the shampoo and conditioner
that I use is both for like the hair
loss because I lose hair like crazy so
that is the shampoo and conditioner that
I use and I really been enjoying it so I
was really excited when they offered
this to me i was really surprised I
wasn't really expecting that at all but
if you guys are interested in something
like that it'll be in the description
box below along with a few other like
discount codes and you know things like
that that I have seen here or there but
anyways I'll stop talking now you can
see the Sun is about to break out
through the clothes and come blind me so
I will wrap this up I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see you in
my next one thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
