we are now in November which is so weird
but that means favorite videos so today
it's going to be the book favorites from
October and this is all the books on
Chiclets plus I got five star reviews
either from myself or someone on my
review team I actually I don't know I
didn't count I think how many books we
have at first I was going to say we have
a lot and then my mind was like no I
don't think we have that money and then
I'm like I don't even know so why don't
we just happen right with might come as
a huge shock to you but my surface is
going to die soon so we need to get
through this video as fast as we can I
swear I think that in every video that I
have to use the surface because if
anyone else has the surface please let
me know if this does this we have the
surface to it will not hold a charge it
doesn't matter if we don't use it if
it's not being plugged in constantly it
dies all the time we don't even use it
that much literally we it is not a daily
thing we use if I mean if we use it like
every three days that's pretty good
because I just hate it it's always oh my
gosh okay this video is not about my
hate for the surface this is about book
reviews so the first review from
october's I got five stars is the girl
without a name and this is by Sandra
block I believe it was a knee that did
the book review it sounded really
interesting when I was reading the
synopsis it says what passes for an
ordinary day in a psych ward dr. Zoe
Goldman is stumped when a highly unusual
case arrives it's a young
african-american girl she was found
wandering the streets of Buffalo in a
catatonic state she's brought in by the
police no one comes forward to claim her
all these have been exhausted so as
always treatment as the last hope to
discover the girl's identity and so
basically it's it's about a Jane Doe who
you know there's there's people involved
trying to help her trying to figure out
who she is who our identity is who her
family is where her people are at that
sort of thing but it's not really
interesting when I was reading the
synopsis and has almost a little bummed
that I didn't get to read it for myself
but Amy's review is really good and
basically her last line is just read
this book
so I will leave the amazon links in the
description box below for all these
books plus the links to the review on
Chiclets blessed so the next one that
got five stars is by me and it is for if
you only knew and this is by kristan
higgins and i actually did a full video
review on just if you only knew that i
will put in the card up above and i will
also leave the links below i give it a
five star review it's one that i listen
to an audio and I'm tending to do my
audio books as just like one review
video on here I go pretty in-depth into
everything the plot etc what I thought
of it so instead of getting into it in
this video you can just go ahead and
watch my other video for all my thoughts
on it but five star review so I
obviously loved it so I got five stars
is promises to keep and this is by
Patricia sands and Annie review to this
one it is the second book and the love
in Provence series the first book is the
promise of province which I believe any
also did review so i will leave the
amazon links below plus the reviews to
her plus the links to her reviews on
chocolate plus for both books in the
series okay the next one is also a
review from annie and it is called dew
point and this one is by maria novella
viggiano i'm not really sure how do you
pronounce that last name but it says
it's a pointed out a poignant debut
about lost the bonds of Family and
unexpected paths of love and in Annie's
review she said to say this book is
engrossing would do it and injustice or
something along those lines hold on
lemme check hey this story is engrossing
would not do it justice god I was like
that first way does not sound right but
so Annie absolutely loved it shows a
great review on chocolate plus again
that link will be below that's another
one that got five stars in October the
next one about five stars is the italian
wife and this is by Kate Katie Kate this
is by Kate furnivall
yes and so the New York Times
bestselling author of the Russian
concubine returns with a stunning new
novel set in Mussolini's Italy and Leah
had a really great line in her review
and it said the characters were
multi-dimensional lovable and always
exceeding her expectations which I
thought was really interesting so this
one is a historical fiction novel and
again it was the italian wife by Kate
furnivall though the next one is a
fallen darkness and this is by RV Austin
and our reviewer Andrea wrote this note
it does say that it's in this in a
serious is the tri Hieu series book too
looks like fallen redemption is the
first one I will check to make sure I
think android reviewed that one as well
if so i'll leave in the description box
below but andrea mentions in her review
that when she's reading a book she makes
notes throughout it like little notes
tree you know remind herself from when
she writes a review she has these notes
that she can look back on and she said
in her review that she only made one
note for this book because it was so
good that she like didn't want to take
the time to put the notes in she just
wanted to keep reading so that is a
five-star bug for sure and then the last
book to talk about is a five star review
from myself and this is pieces of it all
and this is by Tracy krimmer now Tracy's
an author that I've talked quite a bit
about in the videos on here I have
reviewed jaywalking and cashing in from
her as well and I gave them both five
stars and I mentioned how I was able to
connect with Tracy over social media she
offered to send me her books and the
first two I just absolutely loved him
they're like women's fiction chick lit
women's fiction a little bit on the
lighter side chick lit with a little bit
looked like a smidgen more of a serious
side and this one when Tracy asked if I
wanted to review pieces of it all she's
like it's very different from the first
two you know you it's okay if you don't
like it type of thing and I was almost
kind of nervous going into it like am I
gonna like it you know that sort of
thing but I started reading it and this
is one that I would classify as new
adult because the main character that we
follow Beth she
is a high school senior and she's
getting ready to go into her freshman
year of college so I would classify it
as new adult and basically it's just
like we have the good girl versus the
bad girl or it's a good girl vs my girl
no that's not what we have we have the
good girl who falls in love with the bad
boy there we go and it's it's kind of
one of like those classic scenarios of
good girl bad boy but there's so much
going on here like it is very I think
the words that i use were like it's very
honest it's very raw it was very deep as
a very emotional book I thought but I
really connected to it my first book
that I wrote is called destined to fail
and it is on the new adult side as well
and I actually like as i was reading
pieces of it all I was like I I just
felt like I could connect with those
characters so much because I I don't
want to say I saw a lot of destined to
fail in it but I saw a lot of like the
same patterns you know that sort of
thing there's a lot of issues with like
alcoholism abuse addiction you know that
sort of thing in here and I just I love
to read these types of books because
they just feel so real to me and
especially as I kept thinking I was like
the ending you know I feel like maybe I
know where we're going to go with ending
it didn't go there it didn't go there
and that's and that just made me love
the book even more so again the amazon
links will be in the description box
plus my full review on amazon if you
want to check that out as well okay so
that is all of our october five star
book reviews on Chiclets plus one I hope
you can not hear my stomach growling in
this video it is 330 and I have not
eaten since 730 this morning and that
