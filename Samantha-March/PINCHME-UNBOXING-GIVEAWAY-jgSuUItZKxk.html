today's video is going to be a real
quick one it's going to be all about my
latest pinch me box so if you guys
haven't heard of pinch me yet it is a
subscription box where you can get
samples sent to you in the mail and it
is completely free this is my third or
fourth pinch me box I believe so a few
weeks ago and pinch me asked if I was
like to do a video with them I was like
yes please because I've been getting
this box for a while now and I have
found a lot of products that maybe I
wouldn't have tried what this box that I
ended up liking and disliking I've
actually had a few products in my pitch
me box and I was like whoo I'm going to
buy a full-size of that one so I've been
finding the box really helpful myself so
this video is in collaboration with
pinch me so a big thank you to them for
sponsoring this video and they are going
to be giving away on the same box that I
received so one winner will win what I'm
about to show you inside I haven't
opened it out myself yet I have it open
and ready but I'm that person that likes
to be surprised so when it comes like my
subscription boxes I always wait to open
it because I like to be surprised I
thought we could be surprised on camera
but there will be a giveaway for the
spots at the end so if you do want to
win that stay tuned
what I'm just going to go over real
quick what pinch me is unbox the box and
then talk about the giveaway and then
that will be a this is a weekend video I
think I have uploaded a video every
single day this week including my
livestream on Tuesday so I am pretty
proud of myself for that but normally I
at least upload four times a week
Wednesday's are my will i buy it series
and I upload on Thursdays Sundays and
Mondays so you will always get for our
videos from me every single week and
then sometimes I have a bonus video here
and there I think I'm going to start
live streaming every single Tuesday at
4:00 p.m. at CSP I think it's the time
that will work the best for me to be
able to do a live stream so if you
haven't subscribed yet I hope that you
will consider hitting the subscribe
button so why don't we go ahead and jump
into this pinch me box what it's about
how to sign up and then what I received
in my latest box so like I said with
pinch me it is a subscription service
box you do need to go to the pinch be
calm a website sign up make your account
and then they have what is called
samples Tuesday it's not 100% sure on
how often they run their sample Tuesday
but whenever you go to the pinch meets
it will always say things in the upper
left-hand corner right hand corner it
will say when the next sample Tuesday is
so the next sample Tuesday is going to
be June 20th yes June 20th so I'll have
that information that listed in the
description box so what you would do
after you make your pinch me account on
sample Tuesday you would go in and you
would select what samples you want to
receive and then they ship out your box
this is all free the only thing that
they're asking in return is to give your
thoughts and opinions on the items that
you do receive I think that's pretty
cool these are sample sizes but again
you don't have to pay any money for them
and I like it
to be able to sign products that maybe I
haven't bought in yet and I find
something that I really like or like I
said earlier there was once a Essie nail
polish that I got and I'm so excited for
it
I love nail polish and such a nail
polish junkie and I tried it I was like
oh my gosh I totally disliked that nail
polish and I probably would have bought
it on its own and so I was glad that the
black saved me from purchasing the Essie
nail polish but I like samples deluxe
samples I have so many of them because
it's really nice to be able to try
things out and also a lot of times for
things like makeup and skincare what I'm
into it's really really hard to go
through full-size products so I have no
problems with samples but again it is
free not to put a credit card down or
anything like that you just have to
remember to go in on Tuesdays select
what you want in your box and then as
long as things are in stock they will
then and send them to you I know they
have a variety of different items I want
to show you guys what is in my box and I
open it up this is what it looks like a
note saying thank you and then oh this
is cool so they have I don't remember
this being in my other boxes it has
what's in the pinch-me box so it has
everything that's in here and a little
description of them I really don't
remember seeing that my past boxes so
that's very cool so that will be handy
to have while I look at everything so
the first thing I see on top is food
which I am not mad about so these are
from Quaker they're the chocolate chip
chewy bite I will totally eat these so
that is pretty exciting but made with a
hundred percent whole grain so they're
still see good for you but chocolate
chips at the same time now I'm mad about
that
okay so next thing that I see in here is
a Gillette deodorant a little sample guy
of a Gillette deodorant system my
husband because he will probably be able
to use that and then let's see it also
in here is a bug protector from
mosquitoes oh this is actually very
needed for us right now so it's a bug
protector all natural bug repellent
let's see it provides protection against
mosquitoes gnats and other biting
insects it's made from a blend of
essential oils oh and you can use it on
your pets that's pretty cool actually
we've been sitting out on our desk a lot
lately and this will be nice it has a
little spray so I guess you just spray
this on you and it helps repel the
insects
I'm actually really not not that might
be like a really random thing but we've
been being on our deck so much with the
nice weather so that will actually
really help us and keep it going this
also makes me incredibly happy
I like this box because it's not just
makeup and beauty like you can get a
variety of different things and some of
those things really actually go in handy
for me so this is the scotch-brite
lint roller okay and our other literally
that we have is really getting down
there you know how you like peel off the
lint roller I can tell we're getting
down there so that is really cool but
now we have a backup our dog doesn't
shed too much she's a beaut
I definitely still does but we job safe
for our friends dogs very often and
we're over at our friend's house very
often and they have a German Shepherd
who sheds like crazy I have to be
pulling out our lint roller when we are
watching Jack or even some of our other
friends dogs and family members dog they
do shed so it's really nice to have a
liberal around so that makes me excited
seeing a lot of products in here from
Peoria and seen for so let me I'm going
to do those last so let's see the next
thing that I see is some Belgian
chocolate grass feed way ok so here is
what that one looks like in those
directions for use you mix it with 12
ounces of cold water shake until blend
it and you drink in the morning
oh so it's just that I would
to this and water I will try that I've
been kind of on a more of a health kick
lately so I will definitely try this and
see what I think of it what do you guys
it gives you guilty it's good you can
guilt is bad I truly have no idea but I
will give that a try
then because you truly do get like
anything and everything in this box
mixed up we have some badges little uh
little block well would you look at that
says it's that's order before it starts
keeps you feeling fresh all day its
gynecologist test that with clean fresh
scent it that's gentle enough to use
every day we got a little sample guy of
that one our item in here it was
underneath all like the white depth but
I found it so this is a shampoo and
conditioner sample from Carol's Daughter
for damaged over-processed hair well
that's not me almond oil aloe butter
proteins that strengthens hair from root
to tip and helps defend against future
breakage I don't think I've tried their
shampoo and conditioner no I've tried
this brand but I don't think the shampoo
and conditioner so that's very cool that
some samples of that and next I see a
bunch of stuff from Biore which like
have me so excited because I've been
hearing so many things about these
products messy never to ride them so
this one is their charcoal acne scrub
which sounds awesome and right up to my
alley so the charcoal acne scrub and has
salicylic acid acne treatment and
charcoal the team up to scrub out acne
causing dirt and oil from pores okay and
then also in here I've been seeing a lot
about this too this is the Biore baking
soda cleansing scrub I feel like
everybody's been talking about this one
so this says powdered of foam formula
activates with water for deep clean and
gentle exfoliation but naturally
dissolved so you can never over scrub
that's very cool I don't know if you
guys can tell in the video but like my
forehead of my nose is peeling so much I
can't wait to be able I've been trying
to like go nice on my skin I got sunburn
so bad last weekend which was crazy with
the amount of SPF I had on my face but I
still got burnt like crazy so I'm going
to be excited when I can like go in and
exfoliate dead skin off me to suspense
it's been a real treat okay so we also
have from Biore
the baking soda acne
scrub so that's what that one looks like
again salicylic acid acne treatment and
baking soda team up to gently exfoliate
skin and clear acne so it's the scrub
unclogs pores and bounce of skin Turia's
breakouts giving you clearer skin in
just two days
the or you can be found at the drugstore
so it's all very affordable which is
nice because if I end up falling in love
with something I know it will be
affordable to replace and then the last
one here is their baking soda pore
cleanser that what that looks like let's
see it's a deep cleaned to remove dirt
impurities from the pores well generally
exploding away dead cells for skin that
is also smooth so I'm definitely
motivated to put all these be your
product I love skin care so this has to
be super super pumped so those are
probably my favorite items in the box
and then it's probably gonna sound
really weird like the lint roller
because I feel like a literal or the
thing that when we need a new one and
you go to the store and once you like
put it on the list here I'm jus looking
at your lids you forget it because like
who remembers a lint roller so that
makes me excited and then I also really
want to try I also really want to try
these guys because it's like good so
that is everything that was in my pinch
me box I suppose you guys enjoy seeing
what was inside if you want to win this
pinch me box as well and everything that
was in my box
I will go ahead and have a giveaway link
down below it'll just feel like the
generator that I use in most of my
giveaways because this giveaway is from
pinch me and not myself it is going to
be limited to us only and I am only
going to have it open for a week so
instead of being international open for
a month like most of my giveaways it's
going to be open for one week and for us
only and that is because the box is not
coming from me it is coming from pinch
me and that is what they requested I
also did double check my email right
before I came on and she said one of the
you re items is out so you will get
everything else in the box except one of
the BRE items and I'm not sure which one
I shouldn't specify so just so you know
when you get the Box you'll get
everything inside except one up DB or
eight items but that's going to be
everything for this video a thank you
again to pinch me for letting me make
this video this was super cool I guess
that I've gotten it several of these
boxes and I just been having
time with them so I was excited to bring
this to you in case you haven't heard of
pinched me yet yourself I'll have all
the information listed down below when
the next sample date is and how to sign
up and all that good stuff I would say
if you don't have your account I just
