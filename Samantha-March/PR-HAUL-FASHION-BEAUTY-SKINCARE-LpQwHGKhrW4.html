today's video is going to be a new PR
hall so I have some fashion makeup
beauty skin care to go over with you
guys so these are items that have been
sent to me by companies to review and
test out and let you guys know what i
think so i wanted to share my hall with
you this video is not sponsored by any
of these companies they've just all sent
me these to try out and get my opinion
so i want to share my hall with you
because i like doing these types of PR
halls and then if there's anything that
i mentioned in the video that you guys
think you want like a follow up video on
a review video after I'd like try it out
and test the things please leave that in
the comments down below so I know but
why don't I go ahead and have been to
this PR ha the first ones I want to talk
to you about is from the company adore
me now in my last PR hall which I can
leave link down below I did talk about
adore me they are and online website I
believe they were like kind of well
known for more like their bras panties
lingerie that sort of thing but they
reached out to me when they launched
their athletic line and I'm big into
fitness and working out so I was able to
get some like leggings and sports bras
and try out from them so i'll leave that
video link down below cuz i do go over
it and i really had a good experience
loved what I got I still wear my likings
all the time some of my like new
favorite leggings so they actually
reached out to me again and said you
know would you want to try something
else from us and I said yes and I
decided to go was three of bodysuit I
have really been wanting to get
bodysuits for a while now it's just
always kind of made me a little bit
nervous but I was like well you know
here's my opportunity I can kind of try
them out and see what I think and so far
I am really impressed so this is one
that I got it's a black bodysuit it has
long sleeves and they are sheer and then
the top part up here is sheer as well
and then it has lace throughout the
bottom and then the actual like bodice
is also like black lace I love it and
the back does have like a button
enclosure back here also does have snaps
here as well which is helpful for like
going to the bathroom and that sort of
thing but I was
really really impressed with this I can
share photos because I did wear this
actually in my Sephora PIB sale haul
video I ward but I also took some yoga
photos in it as well I'm a big yogi and
i just think the pictures came out
really pretty wearing the bodysuit it's
those pictures in here so you can see
what it looks like on me I like where in
the body suits because they look they
looked good with leggings I tried him on
with leggings but also even like
high-waisted denim I thought looked
really pretty as well I just thought
body suits would be fun not only to film
in because sometimes I'm like I feel
like I'm wearing the same thing over and
over and over and body sees kind of can
like switch it up but also for like
going out trips things like that I just
thought it would be really fun to have
some body suits on hand I do live in
Iowa so they're kind of hard to wear out
especially the ones that that I've chose
because my style is not Iowa I'll go
ahead and say that I don't have Iowa
fashion style but I just thought that
would be really nice to have on hand for
when I do go out or you know things like
that and so far i have worn this one
like all day type of thing animals
leggings and denim and i absolutely
loved it so each piece will be linked
down below the next one I got is also in
black and this one is a bit more saucy
this is definitely not Iowa style so
again it is black and it has the sheer
lace here as well and then it has
cutouts in the center which I thought
was really fun and then some more lace
down here again it snaps and then these
are what the straps look like so this
you know honestly I mean definitely
could be used as lingerie if that's what
you wanted it to when I tried it on I
tried it on with leggings and then some
denim as well and it looked really good
because I mean are you going to wear
this like everywhere in anywhere you
know no especially because of the
cutouts at the bottom but even if you
pair it with something more high-waisted
it doesn't really give like to socio
effect in my opinion but but I am a
saucy dresser so so I don't know there's
that but there is a lot of like sheer
detail right here and then you have the
lace here I really like the way that it
looked again but again
this is just my personal style I know
this won't be for everybody but I
thought I just thought this was so cute
and so fun and I'm trying to convince my
girlfriend to have her bachelorette
party in Vegas and like I'm gonna bring
all of these all of them so the last one
I picked up is like a really pretty like
gray purple type of color so this is
what it looks like and so it has the
sheer up top as well and then it has
like almost like little I don't know
what you call these little cap sleeves
here um snaps at the bottom again and in
the back it does have like the button
detail again but I really like this one
I thought this one was really
comfortable this is definitely I would
say like the least saucy out of the
three that I got but i really really
really was excited for all of these
bodysuits because I thought they all
looked great I got extra smalls in all
of them because I saw on the website
when I was looking through him someone
said that she was like 5 6 i'm like 120
and the extra smalls fit her really well
i'm 55 so I was like okay you know I'll
do an extra small they are a tad tight I
probably would have been fine with a
small but I bet the smalls would have
been a tad big and so I'm usually
someone in especially when it comes to
body suits like tighter doesn't bother
me so the extra small works for me but
just so you guys know that is my height
55 there you go for sizing purposes but
really excited so far I've been really
impressed with the quality of everything
that I've gotten from adore me like I
said I've tried out their athletic wear
and now I have been able to try out
their body suits been very impressed
with all of it like I said these three
will be linked down below in case you
were interested in them and adore me
does have a membership program that you
can do you don't have to be a member to
make a purchase on the website but they
have a membership and they also have a
VIP membership where you pay a certain
amount a month and then like sometimes
it's like you get like a free sets
include it with your purchase or you get
a discount on the different sets that
you could purchase but like I said they
have bras panties lingerie athletic wear
swimsuits body suits like pajamas
sleepwear they have a lot of different
options and I've been impressed with
them so far I wasn't really sure the
first time what to think and
I was really really happy with them
someone they contacted me again I was
really really looking forward to trying
out more and trying out something
different from them so I'm glad I went
the bodysuit route because I'm really
excited to have something like this in
my collection and so far everything's
been working out really well for me so
that's my newest additions from adore me
and they will be linked down below so I
was really excited to get another lip
monthly a bag in the mail this month I
was like yes I got one for October it
was also in my last PR hall which will
be linked down below like I said I was
really excited when lit monthly reach
out to me again and asked if they could
send me the November bag because i love
lippies it's still funny because i'm one
of my aunt's i haul videos I talk about
how I'm not an eyeshadow palette junkie
and I'm not a blush junkie and someone
commented in wrote like then what type
of makeup junkie are you and I was like
lips I love lips I cannot ever stop
myself from buying lipstick so lit
monthly is a subscription service and
they send you I think it's either four
to five full-size products in your bag
each month I do have a discount code
with them it's just March beauty i'll
leave that link in the description box
below but you get fifty five percent off
your first bag which i think is awesome
because i think it comes out to being
like five dollars for the bike or
something like that so that will be in
the description box below and they also
have introduced a new feature so for
your lip monthly bags you can now log
into your account and you can choose a
shade for one to three of your products
I believe it said so instead of just
getting like the random shades you know
that you will at least have one product
and there in the shade of your choosing
which i think is such a good idea when I
saw that I was like yeah that's an
awesome idea but I truly just got this
bag I have not opened it yet so I don't
know what's inside so why don't we just
go ahead and see so the first thing that
I see is from make a beauty I think is
how you pronounce it make a beauty and
it says it is a tinted lip balm in
velvet rose so this is what it looks
like I've never tried anything from Mika
beauty so I think I'm going to keep this
one for myself so I can try it out
because yeah I've never tried anything
from this brand but I do hear about it
on youtube so like I said it's a tinted
lip balm and velvet rose it looks to be
like a purple type of color so
it is pretty cool and then the next
thing that we have in here is from
freeze 24-7 oh it's an anti-aging eye
serum okay so in my last bag it was all
lip products it was like either lip
gloss on lipstick or lip liner so that's
interesting maybe they're expanding to
put more things into their bags but I'm
like a freak about I serums eye creams
under eye patches I love it out like I
want all of it give it to be all so this
is actually really exciting for me so it
says it helps reduce puffiness fine
lines dark circles and other signs of
aging around the eye so there is what
that one looks like so I'm definitely
not mad about that because that's like
that's like another obsession in case
you're wondering I stuff I just like
skin care in general to be honest so the
next one I see is from Luna in tight
Annja titanium and it says it's a lip
gloss so let's go ahead and open this
package up oh oh that's Barkley okay so
there is what that looks like so it
definitely looks like it's a glass going
to give out a ton of sparkle again this
is from Luna in titanium I think is what
it is but the packaging is really nice
it's just this um blue packaging like
that and then the last product in here
I'm actually pretty excited for this one
this is from Oprah it's their lip liner
in silk so that is what that one looks
like I have one other liquid lipstick
from Alfred and I think that is it I
have never tried any of their lip liners
i'm not a huge lipliner person because i
don't wear them all of the time but
there are certain likell like oh it
lipsticks especially that you just need
lip liner for and this color is just a
great color and that would match a lot
of my liquid lipsticks because this is
like my color shotgun still I'm not sure
if the bags are different for people i
did watch one other lip monthly video
from last month and the gal had all the
same products as me so I think maybe
it's a car
the board you're getting the same thing
either you can pick your shades which is
cool but so that was everything that
came in my November at lip monthly bag
and of course you get the little bag as
well in here again I will leave this a
link down below and then also my code
March beauty for the fifty-five percent
off if you are interested in getting
your own bag so keeping on the lip trend
i also got a package from who is she
cosmetics that i want to share with you
guys so they sent me three of their lip
composite and then two other lippies
this is a fairly new package to me but i
have tried out some of the lip
composites i will leave this link down
below as well i will link the website
and then also the Instagram the brand is
becoming more well-known i think and i
know that nikki tutorials just mentioned
i believe it was the lip composites in a
video and so that was pretty exciting to
see but like look how cool this is if
it'll focus this is called ethereal and
I do have Instagram videos of me putting
on the ethereal composite and then also
dream catcher which is like a metallic
purple and I'm just like super
interested I started seeing these like
lip hybrids lip composite videos I've
been starting to see more and more of
them and I've been kind of like very
super curious about him so when I got
this package I was like yes I've
definitely tried these out so so far
I've only tried these two I can leave my
Instagram videos link down below they
did also send me a red one in a
heartbreaker and on the website looks
like these run from anywhere from 10-30
to 1250 i think it was it also send me
to other lippies I think these are their
vegan lip leathers I think just from
looking on the website but I haven't
tried these out yet but these are what
they look like and then they do have a
mirror on the back as well so this is
what the applicators I look like for
them so I haven't been able to try these
ones yet but again like i said i'll
leave my Instagram videos down below to
me trying the composites on so you can
see what they look like so I can't speak
to these yet but I will be trying them
out but these I just thought we're super
interesting they are very metallic like
you can see in the video you can see
them in the
tutorials they are super super metallic
the thing with these that I was think I
was most surprised about is how
comfortable they are they are very soft
and smooth I mean those are like the
only two words I can think of to
describe these but soft especially when
i first started applying to my lips I
was like whoa okay that like feels nice
like it doesn't feel like you're putting
on a lipstick it doesn't feel like
you're putting on a liquid lipstick it's
a completely different feeling and also
when you rub your lips together it's
just so smooth I mean it's definitely
not I you know have a drying lipstick it
doesn't dry my it will transfer but it
just feels very nice on the lips and
almost hydrating I've had a lot of
people ask me are these comfortable to
wear they aren't sanely comfortable to
wear it might be the most comfortable
thing I've ever put on my lips which is
just so completely bizarre to me but i
really liked being able to try out these
like fun metallic type of colors because
i don't have a lot of that in my
collection and do still need to try out
this red but so far I've been pretty
darn impressed with these I was excited
to get them and like i said i will leave
everything the link down below as well
but if you're interested in trying out
something new i would definitely check
into these lip composites and i should
have a review coming soon on these other
lippies as well but again that was a
package from who is she cosmetics so I
want to go over some skincare next the
company banish reached out to me and
asked if they could send me some of
their skin care to try out and send me
there like starter kit I'm always really
interested in trying a lot when I'm
trying skincare and I like buying says
to try it all out and try it all
together so I said yes so they sent me
at their starter kit which I thought was
super cool so inside so I have this like
little bag from them and then inside
came there pumpkin enzyme mask which
looks like that and then also inside is
there vitamin C serum which I am
obsessed with vitamin C and I even said
that to them I was like please whatever
you said please make sure it there's the
vitamin C and there also is the vitamin
C Beauty elixir which looks like this
and then also in the bag is the active
truck'll clay mask and charcoal clay
masks or so
of my absolute favorite but then also in
addition to those products they did send
along two tools as well and this is
where things in my opinion got really
interesting I did film a video using
some of these products and it should be
on Instagram by the time this is up so I
will leave it linked down below but you
see me using some of these in action so
one is called the banished poor erasers
in my Instagram video but this is what
it looks like hello so basically what
you do is you would put this in the
freezer for about 20 minutes before
you're going to use it and this will get
super cold and then you rub it all over
your skin so like it says it is supposed
to be a pore eraser it's supposed to
banish puffiness redness and enlarged
pores and then also when I was looking
into the bandage skincare and watching
other people's videos a lot of people
were putting this right on there under
eyes and I was like that's a great idea
because you know they say like put
spoons in the freezer and then put them
on your under eyes this is like
basically the same concept so I just
thought that was very cool people have
used this as like even some sort of like
a numbing sensation I've seen someone
like wax her armpits and use this to
like kind of like numb it before she
does the waxing I mean there's just kind
of a lot that you can do with those you
can do whatever you want with it but I
mean those are some of the instances
that I've seen so I used it all over my
face and then on my under eyes as well
use everything so far the one time so
this is something that I definitely will
keep trying out and if you guys want to
see a video on it just let me know the
thing that they send to me it says on
the box just roll with it and it came in
like this little kit so this is what it
looks like and I don't know if you can
see this close up but it has like little
pricks all along it I don't know what I
want to call it like it almost kind of
reminds me of like a cactus or something
and you apparently roll this over your
face it says the bristles on the
banisher create micro tiny holes so tiny
that it will not produce any scars these
holes dig deeper into the epidermis of
the skin to fix this hole the skin
produces collagen and elastin and this
will help new skin rebuild itself and
repair the scar so super interesting
concept to me and a lot of what vanish
is supposed to be is for people with
acne scars you don't necessarily like
it's only limited to them
that's kind of like what their focus was
on if i'm really not correctly from
their website and the email that I got
from it but I just thought this was
super interesting I don't have a ton of
acne scars but I do have some of them I
have some especially along my chin it
does say to use this like tested in an
area before you just go using it all
over your face or wherever it is that
you would need to use it so I did test a
small area down here and I just did that
last night so far I haven't seen
anything from it so i think i will be
giving this a try i am a super super
curious about this one so haven't used
it yet i wanted to make sure that i was
able to test the spot for 24 hours
straight wouldn't have any like adverse
reactions to it but so far I think we're
gonna be so good but super curious about
this I did use the pumpkin mask it felt
really nice felt good to me I will say
that if you don't like the smell of
pumpkin you probably will not like it
because it definitely smelled like
pumpkin I also sprayed on the beauty
elixir after it and I almost kind of
smell like peppermint it had like a
really nice smell to it and then I also
use the vitamin C serum which again like
I'm such a sucker for vitamin C serums I
love them all so I'm really excited to
try this I'm curious to see how it works
i'm just trying to put everything back
together because this comes in like its
own cool little case but it's really
happy that banished reached out to me
like i said when i try skincare i kind
of do like you to try an assortment all
together so i will leave all of these
products linked down below um but yeah i
should be able to give an update in the
next few weeks or so if you guys want to
see that video just let me know and i
will also leave the Instagram video link
down below of me using the pumpkin masks
and some of the vitamin C's and then
also the poor the roller guy because I
think that was actually a lot of fun and
I was really excited to get at an
Instagram message actually from a versus
spa I had posted something on Instagram
with a versus spa product and actually
reach out to me and asked if they could
send me more products and I was like
yeah vs spa is something I used to do a
lot of like spray tans back in the day
and so I was familiar with the name
versus spa because they have like spray
tanning booths and things like that so I
I recognize the name and now they have a
bunch of like at home products that you
can use so I
it's out a few things that I wanted and
they sent me this nice little box over
so I picked out the cleansing body wash
and exfoliator it looks like this so
before you do any like self tanning you
do need to exfoliate really good like
even when you would go spray tan in a
booth I would always shower first and
exfoliate really well because that just
make sure you're getting like the dead
skin off you're not going to have like
patchy areas you know what I mean and
then I also picked out the gradual
tanning spa butter so that's what that
one looks like I also got the
intensifying primer it's supposed to
intensify and accelerate your tan and
then the last thing i got i was so
excited for this is their gradual
tanning face moisturizer this is
actually what i posted a photo of on
instagram i got a mini one I think is in
a beauty combox and I used it a couple
times and notice a difference within two
days I was so like so insanely impressed
with how fast it worked so I definitely
wanted to get the full size of this
because I was like yes this product I
thought was bomb so I'm really excited I
haven't tried anything else out yet
because I was waiting to do this haul
video but I'm definitely going to start
trying it seeing how it goes so you know
I'll cleanse in the shower i'll use the
spa butter right when i get out and then
i will also use the primer to help
intensify and accelerate it and this i'm
just using everyday i'm almost out of my
little primer guy of it or my little
sample guy of it so once that is done is
definitely using this but again if this
is something that you guys want an
update on just let me know but you know
I definitely don't recommend tanning
booths please don't Han it's so bad for
your skin spray tans are a great way to
go and now there's so many at home
options that you can do so I'm excited
to give versus spot a try and yeah if
you guys want to see a follow up video
on vs spa just let me know and I'm happy
to do it but I can definitely tell you
right now that the face moisturizer is
awesome you will see results very very
quickly and I just have one more package
to go over and luckily because all of a
sudden the Sun is gone so my lighting
probably just got pretty strange but I
did get a new package from sigma beauty
in the mail which made me so excited I
am an affiliate with sigma beauty but I
don't get all of their PR packages yet I
only get like some every once in a while
so when I saw that I had a new one
I was so excited and again I just got
this so let me go ahead and take it
apart here this package is full of
makeup brushes I'm so excited for I'm
also make up brush junkie like you guys
want to know what I really love i love

can because there's a lot in here let me
know but i will run through the brushes
real quick so first up we have the l 0 6
which is the precise align brush so it's
just a real teeny tiny brush I don't
have anything like that yet so that
makes me super super excited who this
one looks cool this is the b12 bent
liner brush that's cool I don't have any
sort of bent liner brushes so I'm
excited to try that one out and then we
also have the f 61 this is for angled
cream contour again like I seriously I
don't have any of these types of brushes
i believe so this is making me so
excited oh this is the e4 this is the
lash fan I've seen people using this and
I really want to try it out too and then
also in there is the e 62 this is for
cut crease ooh that'll be cool I want to
get more into like doing cool cut
