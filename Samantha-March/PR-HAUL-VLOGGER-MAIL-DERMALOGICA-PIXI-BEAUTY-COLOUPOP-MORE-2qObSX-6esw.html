today's video is going to be a new PR
hall so I'm going to be sharing
everything that has been sent to me from
companies that I'm so excited about a
lot of things I can review or give you
some feedback on some things my reviews
will have to come a little bit later
down the line they really like to share
my PR hauls not trying to be like oh
look what I got look what is sent to me
but you'll like to share what I have
received especially if I can give
feedback on it and then you'll see in
this video I have a lot of you know like
smaller brands newer brands indie brands
that I would like to give that
recognition to so I think it's really
important to include them in my halls as
well because i want to share new brains
with you guys so if you would like to
see everything that I've been sent
recently please keep watching it wasn't
sure where to start cuz I have a lot to
go over but let's start with some
skincare so i received a really amazing
package from dermalogica recently i was
selected i'm a part of a community
called prenup me and i was selected for
their dermalogica campaign it wasn't
it's not like sponsored or like you made
money often or anything but it's kind of
like influencer where you get the box
boxes it was kind of similar to that
where you get accepted into campaigns
and then you review and test out
products I did share a nighttime
skincare routine video featuring a
couple of the dermalogica products that
I was sent but I thought I would go
through everything with you guys because
I was really amazed at this package I
knew that we were getting one product to
review a new product from dermalogica
but I didn't think they would send us a
big line of stuff and I was just so
incredibly grateful so i have been using
the dermalogica pre cleanse like crazy
recently i love cleansing oils i use
them all the time to remove my makeup I
think it's a great way it's so like it's
not harsh at all that sometimes with
makeup wipes can feel like you're having
to rub really hard to get your makeup
off cleansing oils are just my favorites
to use and this one smells so good like
it smells like you're at a spa I've been
so addicted to that and then the other
thing that I've really been loving from
dermalogica is actually the product that
we were sent to try out this is new I
think it released in stores like january
third so this is the super Foley in
suspension in my skin care video as well
but it's really interesting because it
is like
powder exfoliant so you pour it into
your wet hands and then you can add
water if needed but activates with the
water and it's supposed to be gentle
enough to use every day but since I have
sensitive skin I use it every other day
and I think it's been doing really good
things it's supposed to be really good
for like pollutants in the air and how
that it can affect your skin and your
skin care I've been having a really good
time testing that one out and then
another product I've really been loving
from dermalogica is their antioxidant
hydra missed I'm a huge fan of Miss I
don't I don't know what it is but not
even like setting sprays or anything but
like I have vitamin C sprays love them
beauty elixirs love them so this is an
antioxidant Hydra missed supplements
skins protective barrier by creating an
active antioxidant shield to help fight
free radical damage prevent signs of
aging this stuff is like so refreshing
especially after I used the super
foliage I will spray this all over my
face I just think it is bum another
product that I've been really trying out
recently is their charcoal rescue mask I
love truncal masks especially for what
I'm dealing with breakouts which I
happen before I was testing out
dermalogica I was testing had a
different skin care brand and
unfortunately it really did not do good
things for my skin and I've been dealing
with a lot of breakouts so I've been
using this charcoal mask a lot to try to
help get my skin back to normal though
they also sent along their dynamic skin
recovery high protection moisturizer I
haven't been loving this I am pretty
particular about my moisturizers this
one is a little bit too thick and a
little too like sunscreen e for me I
don't love it i'm a fan of like lighter
weight type of moisturizer so this just
feels like a little like too much on my
skin so I haven't completely been loving
the moisturizer but it's okay and then
the other product that they sent along
that I haven't been able to try yet it's
their special cleansing gel I wanted to
get through my cleanser before I opened
up a new one and i actually just went
through it this morning so i will be
testing this one out very soon but i was
really thankful for preen dot me into
dermalogica for sending me such a
generous skin care package I was not
expecting it at all I thought we would
just be getting the one product but I've
been having a really good time testing
out the skin care brand it feels really
nice on the skin I think it's really
been helping get my skin back to normal
after dealing with some bad reactions so
yeah dermalogica everything will be
linked
below but I've really been liking this
brand it's the first time I'm trying
anything from them and it's been a good
face oh speaking of influenster I did
get a new box box from them so if you're
not familiar with influencer I can leave
my link down below but I've been talking
about them probably since i started my
youtube channel just a way to have
brands connect with influencers and even
just regular old people who aren't
influencers and get reviews and you know
promotion for their products in exchange
for sending you their products they
received a new L'Oreal voxbox so in it
is some shampoo and conditioner the
color care system and they are both for
volume so when I filled out the survey
for this and I said you know like what
type of hair problems to deal with I
said I have really thin hair I don't
right now because I've hair extensions
in but my actual hair is very very thin
so they sent me some volumizing shampoo
and conditioner I'm really excited to
try these I've been holding on to them
in my office because once I take things
upstairs and especially into my bathroom
it's still hard to remember to bring
them down here and talk about them so
I've been leaving him down here until I
was able to do this PR huh but I'm
really excited to try these out because
i actually just mentioned some l'oreal
shampoo and conditioners that i got from
Influenster in my November favorites
video I was really impressed with that
shampoo and conditioner so I'm excited
to try another one so i will see what
this is all about so i was pretty
excited to get my first PR package from
pixi beauty I was so so incredibly
excited and grateful when I got this
package I'm telling you guys no matter
what brand or company it is or what it
is that it's being sent to me whenever I
receive anything I'm just so truly
grateful because I don't get a lot of PR
packages by you know pretty much
everything for myself so when I get
things like this and what I'm able to do
these types of videos it just reminds me
how lucky I am and how thankful I am for
you guys for you know watching my videos
and subscribing to my channel because
you know that kind of that definitely
does help when it comes to brains
deciding if they want to send me
anything or not so big thank you to you
guys um I was just really really
overwhelmed with happiness when I saw
this from pixie because I really do like
pixi beauty and I've been able to try
out some of their products in the past
that I bought myself and I really really
liked what I've tried out from them so
far so I got this package in the mail so
they did send
be there glomus which I actually do have
so i think i'm going to put this into my
giveaway pile and have this included in
my next giveaway I love the glow missed
i think i just used it in my last makeup
tutorial my new year's eve makeup
tutorial if you need a pick-me-up and
you need some glow to your face like use
that glow missed it does like amazing
things it's like instant gratification
but then the other products i sent me
i'm pretty excited about because i
haven't tried any of them out yet so
this one is their beauty sleeping cream
and I actually did test this out a
couple times I love sleeping creams I
was trying to tell myself not to use it
because I have to open sleeping creams
right now I was like don't use it finish
the other two you have and then I
couldn't do it and I used it it smells
really nice it felt good on the skin but
i need to actually be able to test it
out for a long period of time to see
what i think i just want to try to get
through at least one of my other ones
before i open up another sleeping cream
and then i also sent along their glow a
shin dae do so this one says it's a
lightweight moisturizer to nourish
protect and give a youthful glow also
it's a moisturizer so use a.m. daily
apply a thin layer under cleanse and
tone skin oh okay so like I said like
I'm particular about my moisturizers but
I see a light weight and then it's
supposed to give you a glow I gotta try
this one now I got to try this one now
oh I'm so excited okay okay and then
this other one is the 24 karat I'd
elixir with gold and collagen so that is
what that one looks like so this one it
says it's a potent formula infused with
age defying ingredients and peptides to
help smooth fine lines vent signs of
fatigue and reduce puffiness and as for
all skin types you can use am &amp;amp; PM daily
and you just gently roll the applicator
under I from inner corner to outer
corner two to three times for extra to
puffing you can chill before use whoo so
it says the gold stimulate circulation
the collagen strengthen skin and the
peptides plump fine lines I am excited
excited excited to try this one out as
well I was trying to hold off and again
do the prl before I start breaking into
everything so you can like see all the
packaging and everything like that but
I'm pretty excited to be testing out
these pixie products so big thank you to
them for sending me this package company
that I'm really excited to talk about is
simply divine now this is from a friend
that I know
actually from the bookworld her name is
Sarah so she started her own company
which i think is amazing and she said
that she was gonna send me a package and
I just thought that was like the
sweetest thing ever I'm so happy for and
so proud of her and I want to show you
guys what she sent me she did also send
me her card so it says simply divine
natural beauty redefined and then the
website is simply divine Texas com
that's where she lives so I will leave
this information in the description box
down below as well if you're interested
in checking it out but one thing that
she sent that again I've been keeping
these products down here in my office so
I could remember to haul them and this
says it's rose a all day and I believe
it is a like bath soak you'd put it in
the bath I have not even opened this jar
and it smells so good I have like a
little cabinet above my office where I
put everything in there that I still
need to haul or try out and every time I
open that little door it smells so good
and I'm telling you it has to be this so
it just smells so good so spa-like and
then she sent along to other things so
this little one is a sweet renewal face
scrub that is what that one looks like
and then I do want to go ahead and open
it up and see what it looks like okay so
this is nice so they do come with a
protective layer over there oh oh it
smells like I think it smells like
cinnamon brown sugar brown sugar is that
what I'm going for I think it smells
like brown sugar so this is what it
looks like this is the face scrub oh
that smells so good oh nice then the big
guys actually sent this is a brown sugar
body scrub so is it like this thing
thing it's just a body scrub oh let's
see ah oh yeah oh that smells like that
smells even more like brown sugar can
you guys see it it's focusing on my face
okay so that is what that looks like
that is the brown sugar body scrub oh I
cannot wait to put this all over my body
oh that sounds amazing
ok so again that is simply divine my

about is makeup addict so this is a gal
that i found on instagram her name is

well so she sent me this cute package
the feather has since come off and my
dog has gotten to it but I just thought
this presentation was super cute the
feather was on here there was a nice bow
on here in this nice white box I just I
thought packaging was super fun but
inside I opened it up and I found three
lippies and I was so excited about them
and they're all like the new tone lips
that I absolutely love so I'll go ahead
and do some swatches because I haven't
been able to watch them yet I got them
the night that it was negative 40
degrees here in Iowa and I was too cold
to go out to my mailbox so when I did

couldn't swatch them it was really crazy
so this one is in dainty again I will

bridezilla fit so this last one is

Instagram listed down below I'm she
laura is also from Canada so I know I
have a lot of Canadian friends out there
too it's only if you want to support a
fellow Canadian a fellow woman
entrepreneur I just love it so i will be
Laura's information down below and again
thank you so much for sending me a
package I cannot wait to get these on my
lips so I was contact
by bresil miami i think i'm saying that
right and they had some iphone
accessories and they asked if they could
send them to me to review or to put into
a giveaway and so I wrote them back and
I said you know thank you for the email
i actually do not have an iphone so i
wouldn't be able to review the products
i have an android and they came back and
said they would still like to send me
some products for a future giveaway
which i thought was really cool so they
sent along I don't want to take anything
out or anything because I know they'll
be in a giveaway so just a few like
iphone accessories these will be in an
upcoming giveaway so if you have an
iphone you'll get the chance to win
these coming up but i just thought that
was really neat but then also what kind
of like really touched me was there was
this box in here and i thought okay i
wonder what that is because i just knew
that they were sending along the iphone
stuff and their note said you know thank
you so much for you know getting back to
this and for wanting to put our products
in a future giveaway so we sent a long a
clutch as I thank you I was like okay
thank you and isn't it so pretty black
and gold and I just thought it was super
cute and then inside is all gold as well
too I carry clutches all the time so I
just thought this was so nice I just I
just thought that was so sweet so I
definitely wanted to include it and it
even looks like it has like a little bow
back there I just thought that detail
was so cute so I can't wait to carry
this I just thought that was so very
nice but I wanted to make sure to
mention them as well and then also just
give you a little sneak peek if you need
an accessory for your iphone that will
be coming up in a future giveaway okay
and then we are almost done these are
going to be the last last part here so
these next few products are all going to
be from actally I have spoken about
actively before as well again similar to
like an influencer where you get
products from brands in exchange for
reviewing them and this one is from City
color cosmetics and it's their photo
chic color corrector palette so I have
used this quite a bit on Instagram it
has an orange a yellow kind of like a
brownish new type of color and then also
a green I have been using the green
quite a bit for redness which has really
helps when I was talking about my skin
having really bad breakouts I was
definitely diving into the green quite a
bit for that to help to help color
correct that the only other shade that
I've released
here was the orange I've used that on my
under eyes before I apply my concealer
and that one has worked fine as well but
the green has really been like the stand
out for me because of issues i was
having with my skin so it really came in
handy to have that green because just
like the regular concealer just doesn't
cover all the redness that you need so
I'm really happy that I got it for that
I'm not really sure what I would use the
yellow for or this other color for I'm
really sure yet what I would use those
for but the orange and the green I've
definitely used quite a bit Green was a
favorite of mine but if you want to try
to get into color correcting this could
be a fun little palette so I got some
skincare from dr. Brandt this is the 3d
filler mask so this is what the
packaging looks like and then this is
what the product looks like I was super
excited to get this and i really like
dr. Brandt's skincare so the 3d filler
mask let's see it says it's a self
sculpting formula with hyaluronic acid
peptides and add a fill-in dr. designed
to visually reval you mais fill and
reshape the appearance of face contours
don't like gravity to be your destiny
and it says one hundred percent report
that lines and wrinkles look less
visible after one week and ninety-four
percent reported that skin looks plumper
so you have a little brush and then
inside you have a lot of product and
does say that you are supposed to use
daily so I recently just got this I am
only on day four of trying it out i do
want to try it out for at least a week
if not like 10 to 14 days and see what i
think when i do apply it my face feels
tighter for a few minutes for maybe like
five minutes I can tell that my face
feels tighter and I have like a lot of
wrinkles right right here and after day
two I honestly notice that they looked
softer like they didn't look as harsh so
I'm super curious to keep trying this
out and see what I think about it so
stay tuned I should have more of a
in-depth review coming soon on that so
it's really excited to get another
product from colour-pop i recently got
an ultra matte lip from them in Perkey
which turned out to be one of my
favorites i believe i did talk about it
in a video but they also had their
moment of weakness collection up there
as well so you could go in and choose a
shade I chose sunday and i was really
excited when colour-pop agreed to send
it to be very thankful sale of color pop
I've been buying from them since before
i got on youtube so this is an ultra
matte lip so this is in sunday and i
haven't even swatched this one yet I've
been kind of waiting for this video but
i did also just get it so this looks
like a really beautiful Sunday type of
shade just a really pretty pink nude
absolutely one hundred percent my shade
love it looks very pretty so I can't
wait to try this one on my lips so that
one is in sunday again just very
grateful for color pop and actually to
be able to send me some of these
products I absolutely love testing out
lippies of course the last thing that i
got from actively i just got this in the
mail last night actually it's from Real
Techniques and it is a brush set so it's
the enhanced I set so it looks like it
has four different brushes in here so
also does come with its own little brush
cup that's really awesome so it has a
shadow brush a crease brush a fine liner
brush a shading brush and then the lash
separator so i really like real
techniques i have a lot of their brushes
i have their sponges and i really like
them so when I saw this I was like I
want to try out some brushes so i'll be
using these in some tutorials soon but
that is everything that I've been sent
recently from actally again if you are
an influencer I can leave my actively
link down below I get like a referral
point if you sign up with my link so I
would be so grateful if you did you need
to have like a certain amount of
subscribers or followers or things like
that but i'll leave my link down below
if you want to check it out and see if
you can get signed up for but they have
some really cool brains on there you do
have to kind of write a proposal to the
brand saying why you want to test out
their products and you know where you'll
put your reviews and things like that so
you won't automatically get accepted I
don't get accepted for everything but
I've been really happy with what I've
been accepted for and it gets to you
quickly and then you need to do your
pretty fast turnaround so that is
everything from actally and then one
more thing that I forgot to mention i
did get hair extensions i mentioned them
prior in the video i was going to like
braid or curl my hair or do something
with it today and I didn't so this is
this is what they look like right now oh
I did get some hair extensions these are
from irresistible me I am planning on
doing a full hair extension video
showing how I put in hair extensions and
things like that and then maybe doing
some hair tutorials in the future as
well with the hair extension
but again these are from irresistible me
I got at the 22-inch 200 gram royal remy
hair and I believe in golden blonde was
my shade I feel like it matches my
natural hair pretty well so I'm excited
for these but like i said i will have a
more in-depth video coming up soon about
how i put in my hair extensions and kind
of how I picked them out and about
irresistible me but I'll leave that link
down below if you are curious about
getting some hair extensions these are
from irresistible may have been wearing
them for about two weeks now and I've
been really happy with them so I'm
excited to do some hair videos coming up
I don't do a lot of hair videos on here
but I've been excited to have hair long
long beautiful sick hair very very happy
about it but that's going to do it for
my PR hall alright guys so that is
