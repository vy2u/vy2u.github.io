today's video I'm really excited to do
because I'm gonna be chatting about
products that I've received a PR that I
would spend my own money on and also the
flip side that I would not spend my own
money on my friend Haley here on YouTube
started this a while back and right when
she did her videos I knew that I really
wanted to do them as well so I will have
both of her videos it will list it down
below she comes up with so many great
ideas and I love her content but I'm
also really excited because today's
video is going to be a collab video with
my friend Katie Maria from my vanity
here on YouTube I'm so excited to do a
club of Katie she's been a friend of
mine for a very long time she just
recently started her YouTube channel and
she has been killing it ever since that
she started she recently had a baby and
she is still somehow finding out a way
to keep putting up videos which i think
is awesome so I'm really excited to do
this collab with her I think if you
enjoy my channel in my content you would
absolutely love Katie's as well so of
course I will have her video listed down
below and I'm really excited to see the
items that she chose that she would
spend and would not spend her money on
as well but if you would like to see
some of the products that I received in
PR that I would and would not spend my
own money on why don't we go ahead and
get started so first up a product that I
would spend my own money on is from
Urban Decay and this is the naked skin
concealer I love this concealer talked
about this in the past that at one point
I was kind of going back and forth
between should I buy the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer everyone talks
about it raves about it or should I buy
the NARS radiant creamy concealer
everyone talks about it everyone raves
about it I couldn't decide which one to
get and I ended up going with the NARS
and I really did not enjoy it at all and
then I got a really amazing PR package
from urban decay and this concealer was
in there and I was like girly da messed
up you should have bought the Urban
Decay concealer that was a mistake this
has become my absolute favorite
concealer I actually have it on today
and I didn't even plan that because I
did not know us all in this video today
I have it on today I really enjoy it I
will most definitely be repurchasing
this one when it runs out because I
cannot not have this one in my
collection it's $29 but still I'm gonna
buy it again because I need to have this
concealer in my collection and I feel
like that says a lot
next up a product that I would not
purchase with my own money that I did
receive in PR is from a Kevin a Quan and
this
the sensual skin primer I talked about
kevin naquan or kevin aqua beauty a ton
of so many products from that brand I've
been really really still thankful and
grateful to get a ton of pure packages
and there's a lot that I really enjoy
from Kevin and Quan
but as with every brand it doesn't
matter there's always going to be hits
and misses within that brand and this
one it's not that I really don't enjoy
it or dislike it or I won't use it or
anything like that but I would not pay
my own money for this product if that
makes sense so the sensual skin primer I
was really excited when I got it I like
the packaging it's kind of unique here
where you actually press it down and
then the product comes out I don't mind
it on the skin it's kind of almost more
like a moisturizing type of primer it's
nice and lightweight but I don't feel
like it really does anything and I think
maybe back when I got it it didn't
really bother me as much because I used
to have that perception of primers don't
really do anything anyways and I have
been proven very wrong by a lot of
really amazing primers and when I
realized that there are plenty of
primers out there that actually do
provide benefits to your skin I was like
oh this one doesn't really do anything
for me but then I think the biggest part
of why I wouldn't as well is because
it's $52 so that is a very high price
hike to pay for a primer I've said in my
past videos I think it was my Sephora
wishlist that I was talking about
because I think I was talking about a
$52 primer from YSL and I was like
that's just a lot of money for a primer
you know I try to not go over the $50
range when buying foundations and now
I'm gonna be buying a primer for that
like I just need to see a really amazing
result or some kind of with my skin if
I'm gonna be spending fifty-two dollars
on a primer and this one just doesn't
really do it for me so I enjoy tunne
from the Kevyn Aucoin brand but this
primer I would not send my own money on
another product that I received in PR
that I would spend my own money on and I
have already spend my own money on
plenty of times who's surprised okay
surprise right now that's about the pure
lashes yes yes indeed I did get these
sent to me in PR from here and I was so
excited I love lashes I do not have
lashes on today but I love lashes I love
wearing them even when I'm not even
filming I've just been wearing lashes
forever and they're just
like my preferred go - I got a huge
package of lashes I was like score this
is amazing and then I started trying
them out like double score I love these
lashes I have gone on to repurchase as
several pairs of the appear of cosmetics
lashes they do have some Styles
available on auto which I also think is
really great because I enjoy being able
to get my rewards or like use coupons
and things like that and I am always
stocked up on pure lashes like I love
them my favorite style is this one right
here is bombshell and then I also do
really enjoy the style of diva I just
really enjoyed these lashes I feel like
they're nice and lightweight the band is
really easy to work with and those two
styles that I mentioned I feel like
looks really flattering on my eye shape
these are $14 so they're not the most
expensive lash out there they're also
not the cheapest lash but they're kind
of a really good in-between some of my
favorites I've already gone on and to
repurchase them several times over
really glad that I got those in PR and
item that I would not purchase with my
own money is from Charlotte Tilbury I
was really grateful to actually receive
a couple of PR packages from Charlotte
Tilbury in 2017 it was a brand that I
had been eyeing for so long but it's a
very high-end luxury expensive brand so
I wasn't doing it and when I started
getting a few products I just was like
over the moon excited about it it can be
really really hard as a beauty blogger
wanting to try so many items and wanting
to be able to review items and wanting
to be able to tell people this formula
is similar to that formula this color is
similar to that color but you simply
can't buy it all and I think there's a
lot of misconceptions out there that for
some reason youtubers can likely have an
unlimited amount of funds for makeup
because we have a YouTube channel that
is that true that's not your work that
funds out there and no one's told me yet
that's cold but like I was saying I
didn't really want to try out Charlotte
Tilbury and I was really excited to get
some products and when I got this
eyeshadow palette I was like an
eyeshadow palette from Charlie's never
like oh my gosh this is so amazing
this is called the instant eye palette
and I believe are useless in a first
impression or get ready with me style of
video I can't remember which one it was
but I did use it in a past video and
create it and I look with it it is a
very neutral it has a mixture of mattes
and shimmers but it's a very neutral
eyeshadow palette I liked it the way
that it was broken down in here too
i desk i date i and disco i I liked that
and I liked the layout inside because I
am more like of a neutral girl I'd
colorful looks all the time and that's
not my norm that's not my comfort zone
so I was like oh yes you know super
pretty but unfortunately well it's not
the worst I'm shadow palette that I have
ever used in my life and I still was
able to create pretty looks with it I
don't think it's worth at the seventy
five dollar price tag and I would not
pay $75 of my own money for this palette
again it's nice the mats are definitely
better in here than the shimmers and
some of the shimmers to look so similar
to one another it's kind of like ooh I
wish there would have been maybe more
than a slight variation of that one and
I think the packaging kind of caught me
off guard a little bit because it's just
like the plastic packaging it I don't
know I guess maybe for $75 I don't know
what it was that I was expecting like it
would come with a gold point or
something I don't know but it just
wasn't quite all that I thought it was
going to be especially for such a high
price tag so for that reason I would not
spend $75 of my own money on this
palette other Charlotte Tilbury items
yes this palette not so much okay so the
next item that I would spend my own
money on I have been obsessed with this
bronzer lately
I always list out the makeup that I'm
wearing in my YouTube description boxes
so if you're ever curious about my
lipstick eye shadow anything highlight
whatever it might be
I always list everything down there if I
can link the clothes that I'm wearing I
will I like my nail polish color down
there etc and if you have been looking
at it lately you were probably like girl
stop wearing the back of bronzer like we
get it you enjoy this browser of Rebecca
and Capri cows like we wear something
else I'm really proud of myself that I
wore something else today because I
grabbed this out first I was like put
something else on you keep wearing the
same bronzer this one was actually sent
to me from octa Lee and I don't
necessarily consider actively PR I know
I think some other people do and it's I
know it's just whatever it is that you
think in my mind I don't necessarily
consider actively PR because PR from a
brand is when a brand wants to send you
something just because they noticed you
they think that you're doing good things
maybe they think that you like a certain
product and you are under no obligation
to review something that you just get
sent in
unless you have something else worked
out with a brand can you get a product
you can do what you want to do with it
whereas actally if you're not familiar
with octillion X the bloggers and brands
blenders can actually go on to actally
and request a to review products from
brands they'll put certain products up
there people can go in and request and
you get approved or denied from the
brand I will have a link down below in
case you're interested if you haven't
heard of it yet I will have that down
there for you to check out but I finally
got Becca available in my store and I
was so excited and I really wanted to
try out the Capri Coast bronzer because
I hear so many good things about the
Becca bronzers I recently got one in the
appraised cocolo face palette and I
enjoy it's called the bronze bandha or
the Bondi bronzer and I really enjoy
that one so when I saw this one and
accolade I was like please please please
I would love to try that one out so much
and that I am obsessed cute obsession
the bronzers are more expensive at like
$38 but I'm gonna have to say that now
that I have them and now that I've tried
them out like I get the obsession with
it I get why people collect these and
they enjoy them so much and it
definitely makes me want more of them I
also I really enjoy the fact that
there's a mirror in there but I don't
know if you can even I mean I feel like
I've been doing some damage I'm very
light handed when it comes to my makeup
but I feel like you can tell that I've
already been doing some damage with this
one and I have been so impressed if
you've been seeing me link the Becca
Capri Coast bronzer at a ton in my
description box it's because I've
recently just fallen head over heels in
love with this one so it's fun yes I
love it
Becca you doing it again I like so many
Becca products it's kind of crazy
anyways living on a product that I would
not purchase my own money this one is
from ardell and it is the stroke a brow
feathering pen this is an eyebrow pencil
pen for your eyebrows no no I use this
ones I think it was in a first
impression video and I struggled so hard
I was like what gave you the idea to try
this for the first time on camera like
you make some non genius move Smitha but
that one was a really not genius move I
am not always the best I doing brows I
definitely feel like I'm getting a lot
better but I also have my comfort zone
I'm best using pencils that is what I'm
I'm slowly working my way the pomades
but something like this type of
applicator that almost kind of looks
like a marker and it's super super
flimsy not the best step and I decided
to try it on camera for the first time
it's just really hard to work with I
just don't I just couldn't get it my
brows looked a little bit crazy so this
is one that for some reason I don't know
why I thought I could get it but I
definitely could not and it just
reminded me again that it's okay to
stick with your comfort zone sometimes
especially when it comes to something as
serious as eyebrows and if you don't do
your eyebrows or if you don't do your
armors right a lot of people get really
upset with you so it's okay to stay in
your comfort zone when it comes to your
brows and the Ardell stroke of brow
feathering pen I want to say it was
maybe around like the $10 mark and it
came out with our Dells kind of
expanding with our Beauty line and they
came out with these I definitely would
not purchase with my own money so next
up some items that I receive in PR that
I would purchase with my own money our
Sigma brushes I love a Sigma Beauty
brushes and they are like my absolute
favorite hands-down I actually started
purchasing from Sigma way before I
became an affiliate with them they were
my first high-end makeup brush purchases
because I always heard people writing
about them on YouTube I am now an
affiliate with Sigma and I do get sent
PR from them but it doesn't matter if I
feel like I need another brush or if I
need to replace a brush or anything like
that I'm still going in and I'm buying
the Sigma brushes on my own because I
need them and I love them in my
collection another thing too I will say
from Sigma that I have repurchased is
their Sigma Jiang brush cleaner the
liquid form they just came out with the
foam one but I have repurchased the one
in the liquid myself as well and I think
it's a really nice all-natural brush
cleaner which I think is really
important so I have repurchased that one
with my own money as well and I did get
that one first sent to me in PR but I
just I love the Sigma brushes they're
some of my favorites and I will continue
to be purchasing them even if they no
longer send me any brushes I'm still
going to want them in my collection so
Sigma brushes are for sure or something
that I have and will continue to
repurchase with my own money next up I
have an item from benefit that I do not
have any longer because I loathe it
this Highliner it is called their pushup
eyeliner man I received this in Pierre I
think it was in the very first PR
package that benefit ever sent me they
had a couple of these they're real
push-up liner and I remember the first
time trying to use it I was like mmm
what's wrong with me why can't I figure
out how to use this eyeliner just the
actual like packaging of it it is very
hard to understand and then when I
finally figured out that like the
Prophet when you take the cap off it
looks like it's it's an eyeliner but
it's not you have to actually push it up
and then it comes out of the eyeliner
looking thing it's the most bizarre
thing to describe I wish I would have
kept it around just for these purposes
but when it starts to come out it's kind
of like a gel but it just kind of like
threw it like breaks off and it doesn't
stick around it doesn't apply easily to
the eyes I don't know if I've ever seen
anybody besides the benefit snapchat
team using these eyeliners or saying
anything good about these eyeliners who
has tried it who knows what I'm talking
about or who has tried it and it
actually worked for you I would love to
know the tricks of the trade for that
eyeliner because I just couldn't even
get it to work it wasn't even like I put
it on and I didn't love it I couldn't
even get it on my freaking the eyes it
was just was so crazy to me and it's $24
for the full size your girl's not paying
that money for that eyeliner so the
final product I have that I would
repurchase with my own money is from a
flower beauty and this is their makeup
sponge this is $10 and I had to think
about it for a second because I was like
wait no I purchased this one myself and
I was like no I don't think you did I
was like are you sure you did in because
I have purchased flower beauty products
for my Walmart before and I remember
that I wanted to purchase this one
because I had heard people like really
raving about it but at my Walmart at the
time that I was there you could see the
section for the sponge but it was sold
out they did have any left so that's why
I was confused and like going back and
forth like I can't remember if I already
did purchase this with my own money but
I did it it was sent to me a from a
flower beauty and I will most definitely
repurchase this guy again $10 is half
the price of the like original Beauty
Blender so I don't think that is a bad
price but people rave about this one for
very good reasons because it's just a
balm sponge
it's dirty because I
use it very frequently but it gets nice
and large it has a little like kind of
slanted slope here but it's so soft I
feel like this is the most like
different in a good way
type of material for a beauty sponge
that I have ever felt I just I feel like
it's really unique from a lot of other
ones and I just think it's awesome
flower beauty is coming into Alta I
think the day that I'm filming they're
coming tomorrow because I'm pre filming
this one pretty early but it is coming
in to uLTA Beauty soon and I'm just like
crossing my fingers that this bunch will
be there because I'd love to be able to
get this sponge and to use like coupons
on it and all of that I think it would
be awesome but yeah this one I will most
definitely be repurchasing with my own
money and then the last one I have here
is also another drugstore product this
is from a NYX and this is their matte
lipsticks I was really grateful to get a
big ol care package of from NYX in 2017
with they're just so many lipsticks it
was like a lipstick lover heaven and
have the matte lipsticks in here the
soft matte lip creams the lip lash
arrays and I was so excited I had never
tried out this matte lipstick formula
and I was really excited to do so this
is what the packaging of it looks like I
believe these are six dollars or so so
they're nice and affordable so it's not
bad you know some of the other products
I mentioned do the price that kind of
goes into my thought plan here but these
are affordable but I really do not like
this formula which I was super bummed
about because I really enjoyed the soft
matte lip creams I recommend them all
the time I really enjoy the lip
lingeries I think that they are
fantastic but for whatever reasons these
matte lipsticks I just do not think are
good they're not like the creamiest to
apply to the lips like they're just not
the most comfortable to apply but they
get like super crumbly on me and just
kind of wear away really really quickly
so I really wanted to enjoy these and I
remember trying a handful of different
colors when I first got them and I was
like why don't these look good on me and
I just I just had to I just have to call
it like we're not meant to be together
which is which is really upsetting to me
so the NYX matte lipsticks does anyone
else tried them like are these your
favorites or you like me and you just
can't get him to work for you but I was
really grateful to get these in PR but
unfortunately I would not repurchase
them so that is gonna be everything for
the makeup products that are received in
PR that I would and also would not spend
money on I hope that you guys enjoyed
this video or maybe you'll find it
helpful in some way singing which items
that I really would stand behind and I
would be super happy to purchase with my
own money then also at the same time
some products from brands that I enjoy
and I like some of their other products
but for the ones that I mentioned I
would not purchase my hard-earned money
on those products I would love to know
in the comments what you thought about
all the products that I mentioned and of
course it don't forget to check out a
Katie's channel it will be linked up
below so you can check out her choices
and then also Kaylee's channel who
started this tag which i thought was a
really fun idea both of those videos
will be in the description box as well
but if you guys did enjoy this video I
hope that you will give it a thumbs up I
hope that you will also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys in tomorrow's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
