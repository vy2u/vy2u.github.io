today's video is going to be a new PR
items that I was sent that I would and
also would not purchase with my own
money I did this video about a month ago
I want to say it was i'll have it listed
down below this is inspired from Kaylie
bounty she comes up with so many great
YouTube video ideas so I will have her
video linked down below I know she just
did a new one of these as well so I'll
link her latest video too so you can see
it so Thank You Kaylee for such a fun
idea but I thought it would be fun to
run through some of these products that
I've received again MPR and just talk
over what I purchased this with my own
money would I not purchase this with my
own money and just be able to give so
many reviews on some of these new
products so if you are ready why don't
we go ahead and jump into the video the
first half an item that was sent to me
that I would not purchase with my own
money is from the branded caridy now
I've heard some reviews on caridy I
think they're supposed to be just a more
affordable for and and I kind of hear
mixed feedback a little bit so when they
offered to send me an eyeshadow palette
I said yes and I was looking forward to
it so this is called the nudes and roots
eyeshadow Plett palette I believe it is
it is a $29 and I think that it's just
okay but especially for a $29 eyeshadow
palette I don't find that to be that
much more affordable
um you do get plenty of shades in here
of course so that's a good thing and
when I first opened it and I saw all of
these beautiful nudes and I saw the
mixture of matte and shimmers I got
pretty excited because these are kind of
like my tones but it's just not the it's
not the best quality that I've ever
tried but it's not even to me it wasn't
even like I really like high quality
type of eyeshadow palette I had to work
pretty hard with these the mattes
weren't the most blendable that I've
ever used and the shimmers I definitely
had to use a damper brush when I was
playing with these shimmers in here and
again it just it just didn't get me
super excited you get 21 different
shades it says there's mattes for us
sentence metallics two Velvets and also
a duochrome in here so you're getting a
lot of product in here for the $29 but
it just wasn't something that blew me
away it wasn't something that I
absolutely loved so if I were to say
like would I go out and repurchase this
palette I wouldn't just wasn't a
favorite of my butt
love to know if you guys tried a lot of
items from caridy cuz again it's kind of
one of those things where I feel like I
hear mixed feedback on so I would love
to know your thoughts on them an item
that I received that I would pay with my
own money and I will when I run out of
this this is from Lula Hendrickson it's
the uncover the truth three-in-one and
melting cleanser it's $32 it's just a
cleansing balm to remove your makeup I
did recommend this in my Sephora VIP
recommendations and wishlist video and
once I get done with this
I would totally repurchase it $32 I
actually don't feel like it's a bad
price you're getting a bunch of product
in here it says it contains rose hip
fruit cherry seed and sweet almond oil
and it just takes all of your makeup off
all of your eye makeup your liquid liner
your lash adhesive your liquid lipstick
it smells really nice it feels good on
the skin Willa Hendrickson is one of my
favorite skin care brands I would highly
recommend this guy and I would totally
repurchase it with my own money another
item that I would not repurchase with my
own money is a new release here from
winkie luxe this is their coffee
bronzer in mocha so Winky Lux that just
came out with a coffee line I have a
couple other products that I'm still
reviewing but I love bronzers and this
was the first item that I reached from
the collection that I was like yes I'm
going to review you this is a more
affordable brand you can find them some
of their products on Ulta I think they
or I also found it like forever 21 - but
I was excited when I saw this bronzer
but I will say the first thing that I
noticed when I opened it is that it does
have a very intense coffee fragrance
like I mean it just really hits you and
even as you're applying it to your face
it's it's a very fragrant of coffee and
I actually don't like the smell like I'm
gonna close it because I can smell it
and it just is a little bit too strong
for me and then usually even if
something has a fragrance like as I'm
applying it it kind of fades away not
this guy it sticks around and it kind of
bothers me but at the same time I just
don't think it's a very good bronzer
which makes me sad it's not the most
pigmented when I first opened it I was
like okay this is pretty dark I'm not
sure like I'm gonna have to go really
light hand it and build it up I did just
self-tan today if I get progressively
darker throughout the video it's cuz
it's still processing on me but I was
not self-tan the first time I tried this
I was like I love to go in with a really
light hand and even when I did I was
like okay nothing happened so I build it
up again I was like
but what is happening here especially if
we're just for how dark it looks in the
pan it doesn't translate that to the
face and it also is kind of splotchy I
don't have a huge bronzer collection and
I feel like I've been pretty lucky with
a lot of bronzers that I've tried so
when I put this on and I realized it was
just hard to blend on the face it was
like I was confused and I was like what
why is this happening what is going on
so I gave this a try about three three
or four different times now I've tried
but this bronzer but I just don't think
it's all that good I'd like the
packaging I like that you get a mirror
it's $20 but I would not be able to
recommend it I would not purchase this
with my own money item that I would
purchase this one is surprising to me
but wow I got to give it to this
highlight this is from a color pop it's
one of their super shock highlights and
flexitarian I normally do not like color
pop super shock items their eyes shadows
their blushes their highlights I'm just
not into the super shock formula but
this highlight is so good that I can't
help it I would purchase this with my
own money it's eight dollars for a big
ol highlight which i think is really
good but Dedinje the first time I put
this on I was like are you kidding me
right now
look at that highlight and look at that
highlight it is gorgeous ever since I
started trying it I've been recommending
at this at to people like crazy you want
an affordable highlight you want a glow
you aren't your cheekbones to be popping
check out what color pop a flexitarian
color pop is now at Ulta this one is
currently sold out on the auto website
which it doesn't surprise me at all
because clearly it's just a bangin
highlight but I'd like to know what
other highlights in the super shock form
from colour-pop that you really love but
I was very impressed with this this has
this has convinced me on the colour-pop
super shock highlights so another item
that I would not purchase and I'm super
bummed about this this is a new release
of from pixie Beauty in collaboration
with Dulce candy so this is the cafe con
Dulce sweet glow palette this isn't
supposed to be a multi-use palette for
your eyes and even for your face so
everything in here is a shimmer so
immediately to me I was I would say that
I wouldn't purchase this because I don't
normally purchase all shimmer palette
I'm someone who likes to go into a
palette and get a full eye look and i
typically don't do a full shimmer look
i've done it i
do it it's just not really my like
everyday kind of look I like to have
mats in there so immediately I'm kind of
thinking that but really these don't do
a lot for highlights I've tried some of
these lighter shades as highlights and
they're just not they're not great but
also as eyeshadows which I was more
excited for this as an eyeshadow palette
you know I did get this pixie collection
obviously everything I'm talking about I
got in PR I did get the new pixie
pretties collection so I've been kind of
pairing this with one of the is it wily
or Whaley one of those eyeshadow
palettes that have some mats in it and
then I've been coming into this one I've
played with the pinks I have the peach
on my eyes today again I've played with
these lighter shades and I just don't
find the quality to be great and this is
a $24 I shadow palette pixie beauty can
be found on their website and also at
Target and they're a little bit higher
up there and $24 for this palette I just
would not pay for and I wouldn't really
recommend I guess I do have the peach on
my eyes today this is the second video
that I'm filming and even as I was
getting ready to film I was like that
shadow has almost completely faded on my
eyes so I went in and tried to build it
up I still don't like it
I heard up putting some glitter on the
inner corner just to try to do something
with this look because I was like where
did that I shadow go so they do fade
throughout the day you definitely have
to use a damp brush to build these up
and you have to take your time and build
up these shimmers so again for $24 I
just something I'm finding about the
pixie Beauty eyeshadow palette I don't
love I especially love their skin Carol
especially for the $24 for an all
shimmer palette I would not pay for this
one with my own money these I actually
meant to put on my list for the last
video that I did but then I think I was
it was a collab video with my friend
Katie and I think we were doing five and
five in each category and I kind of ran
out of room and these are the ones that
I knocked off the list but I did still
want to mention them and I you know I
know I've talked about these liquid
lipsticks before but I just wanted to
mention them here especially cuz I did
want to put him in my last video these
are from Oprah these are the ofra liquid
lipsticks and I just think that they're
really beautiful liquid lipsticks I do
recommend these there are about 17
dollars I believe it is you can find
them on the Ophir website and then alpha
is also available at Ulta which i think
is fantastic so I have
a couple of these like mob tones here to
show so I just got this new one actually
in unzipped this one came to me from
octal II which I was really excited to
receive this because it's like it's like
my kind of tone right now there is
unzipped from Oprah and I also wanted to
do a swatch of that one with Manhattan
because this one looks to be like
similar but maybe just a little bit yeah
it's just a little bit more of a
burgundy tone but these are really
really nice like what lipsticks they're
very very long-lasting and especially
now that you can give them at Ulta so
there's unzipped in Manhattan but
especially since you can get them at
Ulta I would definitely purchase these
with my own money I think that they
would be worth it they're very
long-lasting they're nice and
comfortable on the lips for a liquid
lipstick I have a lot of different color
options to choose from so these are two
I've definitely repurchase with my own
money and that I would recommend if you
love liquid lipsticks these next ones oh
boy I would not purchase these with my
own money
these are from a Revlon they're the kiss
a plumping lip creme now I tried one in
a first impression style video and it
looked so terrible on me I ended up
wiping it off I came back in my first
impression follow-up video and said I've
tried another shade it did the same
thing I didn't like it I was like I'm
gonna try it one more time one more time
I'm gonna give these a shot I'm gonna
try a darker shade and then I'm gonna
tell you guys my final thoughts on these
so that's what you're getting today is
my final thoughts and no I do not like
these at all these are $9.99 and I just
don't think they do anything a kind of
flattering for the lips
they showed all of my imperfections my
dry lips the lines on my lips
they went on very just I'm a link that
first impression video below so I
actually zoomed in on my lips and was
like what is happening with these and I
used a really light shade I think it was
this one actually yeah it was Kashmir
crime that I use so I was like maybe it
was too light you know so I tried to
bump it up the next time I tried it it
still wiped it off wouldn't even wear it
like for a video for anything nope and
then I tried a really really dark shade
and honestly that looks terrible it was
streaky but it was like it's like chunky
but streaky at the same time and again
if you have dry lips or a lot of lines
in your lips they're not gonna look good
on you at all
so these were a big ole miss for me so
no I would not repurchase these or
recommend trying to wrap this up I'm
filming at sunset so if my lighting is
getting crazy it's because I waited too
long watching the darn Cubs game instead
filming my bad okay moving on to some
products that I would purchase this is
another one where I went back and forth
on so many of these but I finally
figured out my favorite style of lashes
from morphe so morphe just recently
released lashes they sent me their
entire collection and I was going
through and I was trying things out and
I was struggling with some styles and
other styles I really liked that I
finally I have it narrowed down to three
that I would repurchase myself so
definitely the first pair here is a
chummy I mean all of these lashes I've
used so they're kind of hard to show you
what they actually look like but chummy
reminds me so much of the diva lashes
from Pierre Pierre lashes are $14 more
feet are 10 I believe you can only find
the Marquis lashes on their website now
versus also at Ulta but there's a lot of
you the influencers that do have
discount codes I always use a discount
code hello saving money yeah so you can
get them for a discount as well but
chummy reminds me so much of diva I
think they are beautiful on I love
wearing the chummy lashes I would
repurchase these another style that I
absolutely love is total babe total babe
is not as dramatic as the chummy lashes
but they still just look so pretty and
it's like it's like every three or four
lashes you get a really long lash I
almost dropped them you get like a
really long lash space throughout the
lashes and something about that style is
so cool to me and I just I really
enjoyed these total babes I reach for
them a lot when I'm having that day
where I'm like I don't want really
dramatic lashes
I don't want really thick lashes but I
don't want natural lashes either these
are like the perfect ones loving them
and then also hot stuff these are more
dramatic these are more dramatic for me
but I still like the way that they look
and sometimes you just you wearing I
look fat you're like you need big lashes
you need to go big or you just need to
go home and hot stuff gives them to me
because they're thick and they're
dramatic there's a lot of lashes packed
in here but at the same time they're
just they're not too overpowering the
band isn't too overpowering so I really
like these so I don't think all more few
lashes are fan
a stick for me anyways for my eye shape
for what I prefer but these three style
of lashes if you see the type of lashes
that I wear and that I prefer and that I
recommend and that you would like these
three styles of lashes again they're $10
and I would repurchase these three pairs
myself the final item that I'd received
in PR that I would not repurchase is a
brow product this is from a glossier and
this is the boy brow so this is sixteen
dollars it says it's an Olive one brow
fluffer filler and shaper I feel like I
hear a lot of people talking about this
I see a lot of people using it in
tutorials so when I received it from
glossier I was like oh I'm so excited to
try this and for me I think it's just
one of those things where I don't use
this product a ton I typically fill my
brows in I usually use a pencil and
that's it I don't use a lot of like
clear brow gels I don't use a lot of
like I have some products from benefit
like 3d brow tones and I know that they
have a clear brow gel as well I don't
really use those type of products a ton
so I think that's the biggest reason
with the glossy a boy brow it's just not
something I feel like I absolutely have
to have in my collection something that
I use on a daily basis but for me I did
I wasn't quite mmm I wasn't quite sure I
understood the hype about this one and
again it's probably just cuz that's the
product that I don't use a lot and I
don't need in my routine but I didn't
really feel like it did did much this is
what the little wand looks like so you
just kind of spoolie it through your
brows it's supposed to help fluff them
give them a little bit of shape make
them stay all day and I mean I think
maybe they probably stayed well but like
I said I don't use anything on my brows
anyways and they don't normally go
anywhere so I'm not really concerned
about that but I didn't notice much with
like the fluffing effect there was a day
where I used like a really waxy brow
pencil and I felt like I maybe had like
some weird gaps and so I thought oh my
gosh this is the perfect time to be
testing out this boy brow because it's
supposed to like fluff them and like you
know make them look a little bit nicer
and I was like I am i doing it wrong
like I mean I definitely could be doing
it wrong it definitely could be a user
error because like I said I feel like a
lot of people say a lot of really good
things about this product and I've seen
people going through them a lot but for
the 16 dollars and for a product that I
probably just don't understand
but I don't use a ton I would not
repurchase this with my own money and
then the final product of this video of
this whole video everyone was done yes
the final product that I have to talk
about that I would repurchase with my
own bunny is a current hidden gem that I
just found and I don't know why nobody
has told me about this product in the
past this is from the bomb and this is
their Sh winged eyeliner how come I
never heard about this eyeliner because
holy guacamole the first time I used
this I could not believe what happened
so I got the sent to me from the bomb of
course and I went to pull it out one day
and I was like oh wait a second because
I I pulled it out and I looked at it and
I was like oh no I thought this is an
eyeliner that I don't like because
here's what the applicator looks like
it's more like the brush felt tip kind
of thing I'm probably saying that wrong
but I just prefer a pen a liquid pen
eyeliner that's what I prefer I'm not
great with liners like this so I was
thinking oh girl put put that down don't
do it don't you do it girl you don't you
go screw up because I do almost every
time I try with these liners but I put
on my brave face I walk into my bathroom
I stand in front of that mirror and I
went and then I look to myself and I
thought what just happened here and I
looked a little bit closer I was like
this is the perfect wing in one swoop
once whoo I got the perfect wing I was
like no way and I was like okay well you
have two eyes let's do it again so I
went over here on this side now I went
and I got the perfect wing and I was so
excited about that I thought surely
that's like beginner's luck that was a
one-off thing that's never going to
happen again no every single time I've
used this liner I have loved the way
that my wings have looked typically when
I do my liner I kind of like draw the
wing out and then I will come back I'll
start at the top of the wing and I'll
drag it back along my eyelid nope whew
that's it that's I thought so one has to
do with this liner and I don't
understand it and I don't know why I
haven't used this before I don't know
why people haven't told me to use this
before I'm very confused right now and I
love this liner it's $17 I will
definitely repurchase it when I run out
of this because I think it's fantastic
it's super black it's nice and matte it
dries quickly I've never had a problem
with transfer and I can't believe how
easy it is to do a wing with this
especially because I'm not well-versed
and this type of applicator for liquid
liner I think it's awesome so that is
the final purchase that I would purchase
with my own money that was sent to me in
PR and that's gonna do it for today's
video ok so that's gonna be everything
up for today's video going over some
products that are received in PR that I
would and would not purchase with my own
money and some reviews on them I tried
to bring in newer products as well that
I'm just reviewing and trying out I'm
trying to do a lot more review videos on
my channel so I kind of considered this
a review video so I try to sneak in a
few newer items in here or products that
I've never talked about on my channel as
