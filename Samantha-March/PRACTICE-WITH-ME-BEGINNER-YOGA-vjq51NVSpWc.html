today's video over I would say doing
something a little bit different allows
you guys to be follow me on other social
media platforms especially snapchat you
know that I am very much into fitness
and share my workouts almost every
single day on snapchat and I've been
getting asked a lot of questions to make
some fitness videos and I thought why
not just go ahead and give it a shot
see how it goes over see if I have been
comfortable filming a fitness video
because I don't know I was going to go
just seeing how people liked it and if
you would want to see fitness content on
my channel as well and obviously and
mostly a beauty channel but sometimes I
do other things as well such as like
fashion videos with fashion hauls and I
thought it's a response maybe start some
fitness as well and just see how it goes
see if people are into it but I assisted
getting so many requests so I've been
working on what I could do for my first
fitness video so what I want to do today
is from a beginner yoga
antara section you'll go about three
years ago I really fell in love with it
and I just enjoy it's a daily practice I
enjoy the benefits to my body I enjoy
benefits to my mind and I get a lot of
questions of how you start yoga you know
I've never done anything like yoga or
pilates or not into fitness so where do
I start with yoga and so I thought maybe
we could do some beginner yoga today and
just kind of get into it if you guys
like the fitness videos and other videos
we can maybe do more in the future but I
just thought let's try something new and
see how it goes
so basically when it comes to yoga when
people ask how do I get into yoga the
very first thing that I usually tell
people is start with Sun Salutations so
that's what we're going to do today I'm
going to walk you through some basics
and salutations
I think Sun Salutations are good to
start off with because it's what you do
at the beginning of typically every yoga
practice so a lot of the moves that you
do in a Sun Salutation you will see
those moves across your yoga practice as
well when you go into you know maybe a
30 minute yoga practice or 40 minute
yoga practice you're seeing a lot of the
moves in the sense of
in those practices as well so for me I
feel like specifications is the best way
to stir into a yoga practice I usually
do a Sun Salutation about eight every
single morning when I get up we are in
one of my guest bedrooms
sorry there's probably a really bad echo
in here but this is typically where I
practice so that's we're going to walk
you through today hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video
I do want to say that I'm not certified
I'm not a yoga instructor or anything
like that I'm just so much more enjoys
fitness and I enjoy working out and I'm
taking you through my workouts and show
you what I like to do is kind of like
what I do with my makeup tutorials I'm
not a makeup artist I just show you what
I do so as I'm going to do in today's
video so I hope some of you will
practice along with me or maybe you'll
come back when you're ready to practice
and work out with me as well so I'm just
really excited to try something
different try something new and show you
guys a part of my life that is also
really really big to me and something
that I really care about so if you guys
are ready let's go to the mat and do
some Sun Salutations you know when we
get started we start as close to the top
of our yoga mat and then we're just
going to do a deep breath in and then as
you exhale come all the way down to the
floor as close to the floor as you can
you can be touching your knees your
thighs your calf it doesn't matter it
does not matter how flexible you are and
everyone has to begin somewhere I did
not begin here some days I can't just
look look it just is what it is but
you're going to touch wherever you came
down and then you want to take another
breath and then straighten out your back
kind of look forward and then breathe it
out again down to the floor and then
place both hands on the ground and just
go ahead and step one leg back and then
step the other leg back so you are in
high plank and from high plank we're
just going to lower knees chest chin so
go ahead lower your knees to the mat
then we're going to go ahead bender
elbow your chest to the mat your chin to
the mat within your length all the way
down on your stomach hopefully you guys
can see we have no idea if you can and
then we're going to go ahead breathe in
and lift up to a baby Cobra
and then go ahead breed out come back
down to the mat and then we want to push
up so come back up onto your knees tuck
your toes onto your mat and then come up
to a downward facing dog the towers dome
you kinda want to make it nice a shape
you don't want to be out too far like
this because that is so super
uncomfortable we also don't want to be
real in like this so you just kind of
want to find that nice happy medium
maybe we'll want to pedal your legs out
here to help get some flexibility
through your leg stay here for a couple
breaths usually it's just as long as you
need sometimes when I wake up in the
morning I need to stay here for five
breaths and sometimes if I've already
been working out I only need two or
three and then when we're ready we're
just going to set one foot up to the top
of the back join the other foot then you
want to straighten out your back look
forward again as well come down to your
toes and then inhale your arms all the
way up and then exhale them to your
chest so that right there is the very
basic beginner Sun Salutation a great
place to start this is what I recommend
if you're new to yoga if you're trying
to end a fitness do this type of
sometime occasion over and over and over
again that is what I did when I started
yoga when I started yoga three years ago
I should never practice it it was very
scary to me some of the things that they
would do in the classes that I would
take I wasn't able to do it so we'll do
this in salutation one more time and
then I'll show just a bit of a more
advanced version but when people started
jumping back jumping forward on their
mass I cannot do that for months it
scared me way too much then I'm telling
you guys if you just practice you will
get it when I also started my view a
channel I couldn't do a winged liner and
now I was like peeking at it I'm not
there yet but these medics so practice
it a lot don't we go ahead and go
through that over time so inhale your
arms all the way up and then exhale come
down to your mat inhale halfway up flat
back go ahead and place your hands down
step one leg
back the other leg back then we want to
lower knees chest and chin come up to a
baby Cobra feel a nice stretch to your
back they'll stretch through your chest
lower down to the mat come up to your
knees tuck your toes come back to
downward facing dog and stay here for a
couple breaths again you can pedal out
your feet if you want to already go
ahead look forward at your hands step
one leg up step the next leg up inhale
the halfway exhale come all the way down
and then inhale the arms all the way up
and exhale hands to your chest okay
again so that is the beginner basic Sun
Salutation the next one that I walk you
through is going to be just a little bit
more advanced I'm going to wait till
next week maybe to add on like warrior
warmth and warrior choose just think I
just want to show subsidization AFL if
you guys lose this video and you want to
see another one if we can do a little
bit more advance on salutations in the
next video and just kinda keep adding on
from there but if you are a little bit
more advanced or you want to try a
little something new don't push your
body too fast it's one thing that I
really recommend let's go ahead we're
going to start the same way until your
arms all the way up and then exhale down
to your mat and he'll come up halfway
and then when you exhale put your hands
on the ground and if you want to you can
have your legs back to high plank again
only hop if you feel comfortable I'm not
hoping people help them back for months
like I mentioned it's absolutely
terrifying so if you want to hop back if
you want to step back and then if you
want to lower knees chest chin you can
or if you want to do a chaturanga what
you're going to do kind of push your
toes forward a little bit so your gauge
is just popped your hands and then
you're going to lower your elbow and as
you lower your elbows keep them into
your body don't lower like your
push-up you want to lower them in to
your chest and come all the way down so
you're in a straight line and then push
through your toes push your chest all
the way up your pelvis is off your mask
the top of your thighs are off your back
and you're looking at straight ahead and
you're really pushing through your arms
your elbows are locked tight right into
your body so you're not out like this
which causes your body to fall push up
on your arms and now you are in up dog
and then you get to down dog you can
either come to your meetings and then to
your toes or push your bodies back come
over onto the tops of your toes and meet
me in down dog and let's stay here for a
few breaths and when you're ready you're
either going to step up to your mat or
kind of come up off your toes look your
gaze forward where you want to land and
pop your feet forward not all the way up
to your hands kind of just where you
would come and here we're going to step
into your forward fold and then we're
going to go ahead and come up halfway
exhale lower down touch your mat and
then inhale all the way up and exhale
and see your test let's run through that
one more time again do whatever version
Suzu please let's run through that one
more time is let's go ahead inhale up
exhale come down to your mat inhale flat
back exhale put your hands down either
step or jump back either lower
Eastchester chin or kind of pop your
gaze forward push your toes forward put
your elbow real close to your chest
lower all the way down to chaturanga and
then push back into upward facing dog
and then when you're ready to come back
over the top here toes and meet me in
down dog stay here for a couple breaths
you're ready look forward and either
step or hop to the top of your mat come
up into the half white light back and
he'll reach down to your mat inhale come
all the way up and then exhale hands to
your chest thank so that is what some
basic Sun Salutation to look like and it
is a great start a great place to search
for your yoga practice now keep in mind
if you can't bend all the way down into
the floor yet which like I said
somewhere I can't bend down all the way
either go as far as you can go and go as
far as you feel comfortable with the
more you practice the further and
further and further you will be able to
go again the same thing with when you
come in to plank pose if you can't come
into plank pose and hold it just go on
your knees but keep pushing up on your
arm so you have the feel of silk being
imprint pose you're just not all the way
onto your toes yet same thing with if
you're not able to jump back and forth
which is some of the hardest things that
I dealt with my first practice in yoga
I was not practice jump up and jump back
in a gova class I was so so embarrassed
and so terrified that I was going to
fall on my mat the only place that I
practice was in the comfort of my own
home with no one can see me and
eventually I was able to get it but
don't feel the pressure let the
beginning extent but with starting yoga
is that you just have to practice you
have to take the time to practice and
you just have to continue to practice
because the more that you do the better
that you'll get a more flexible that
you'll get so let me do it for my first
fitness video let me know what you guys
think in the comments below if you want
to see more videos like this I know you
guys could hear me and see me okay I
don't have the biggest space and as you
see like when I go to lift my arms up
sometimes I'm running into the store I
have my mat more in the center of my
room when I actually practice but then I
didn't have enough space for the camera
but I tried to put myself as far back as
I could while still being in the camera
and not hitting my arm on the closet
door continually but you know for the
first couple videos it might be a little
bit awkward both you guys want to
continue seeing them I can you know try
to get a little
a little bit more creative with where I
film but just leave me your feedback
down below of course I've never done a
fitness video so I would love to know
any feedback or suggestions or what you
would want to see but also let me know
if you practiced yoga or if it's
something that you like to do or
something that you'd want to get into
let me know see one see more fitness
videos or math again I thought I'd just
try something new and see what people
thought because it has been so requested
on a few of my other platforms
especially snapchat and so I hope that
you found this helpful
I am sweating it though it's really hot
in this room but even just the Suns
annotations when you do multiples of
them it actually is a good workout
except for your life's different arms
it's good for your core so you will see
if you follow me on snapchat when I
share my workouts I use the website
cracker I always have Cocker in my
description box down below I am an
affiliate with them as I've been using
rocker for three years it was what
really helped get me into yoga and it's
a really cool website I use the app on
my phone
and they have like thousands of workouts
you'll go cardio kickboxing beginner
advanced intermediate like kind of
whatever you want I think I have a link
for a free 14-day trial if you want to
try it out and see if it's for you
so let's Fiera is one of my favorites
for beginner yoga and then Laura
Burkhart is my favorite for more
intermediate advanced yoga so I do have
all that in the description box down
below too if you like to do workouts
from your own home I don't typically go
to classes a lot because I like to
workout at home I also work from home so
it's really eating convenient for me and
a much more affordable option for me and
having to pay to go to a gym or pay to
go to classes but here comes but now I
do need to wrap up this video because
someone figured out that I was doing
something a little bit different and are
you mad that you weren't in the video
you want they buy their body you guys so
much for watching thank you for
requesting a fitness video I really do
appreciate it hopefully you guys like
this or you find it helpful and if you
want to see more just let me know in the
comments down below again I encourage
you to come back practice again and just
keep practicing keep at it because I
sure
meaning that you will start to see the
benefit and you'll see the hard work
paying off if you continue to practice
again either practicing for three years
and I still have the most fantastic at
it maybe some comments and down below
