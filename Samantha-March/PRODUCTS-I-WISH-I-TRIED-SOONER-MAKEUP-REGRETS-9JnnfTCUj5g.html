today's video is going to be all about
two products that I wish I would have
tried it sooner I did this video a while
back a couple months back and it seemed
to go over really well people seem to
enjoy it I've always had it on my list
to do another one of these ones I've
been trying out products that aren't
necessarily new to the market but I'm
finally trying them and I'm like girl
you should have tried those sooner so I
have six different products to share
about today so if you want to see some
of the make up products that I wish I
would have tried sooner why don't we go
ahead and get started
so first up I've been recommending up
these lately so it's gonna be no
surprise that I'm going to talk about
the Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye
pencils I don't know why I did try these
out sooner because I hear people talk
about them I hear people use them and I
just always just kind of like meh I
always look for the Marc Jacobs
highliners which are $25 these Urban
Decay ones are twenty so it's still
high-priced or an eyeliner don't get me
wrong but someone who loves eyeliner and
I wear eyeliner pretty much daily like
it's one of those products that I feel
like I need no matter what and so once I
started trying out these I was like why
did I not try this sooner
like the concept when I did this first
video it came from me so often saying
why don't you try that sooner and I was
like why don't you make a video about
that that's fun but these I think are
just fantastic they're very creamy and
pigmented they lighter it on the
waterline just like the name says some
of my favorites are deep end which I
think this was the first one that I ever
tried and it's a beautiful teal I also
have really been enjoying roche i've
been wearing this one quite a bit lately
it's a kind of like a bronze like a
bronze shimmer it's really pretty and
then what I actually have in my
waterline today and I am I'm really
loving on this one this one is called
heartless and it's just a really nice
like light pink but again it has some
shimmer to it which i think is really
cool so Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on
pencils
mmm I should have been trying you much
sooner this next one here I would
probably consider this to be like a cult
favorite I can't exactly remember for
sure when kathleenlights made this
product is so popular but I've recently
like within the past month started
trying it now
like you don't mess up this is the RCM a
no color powder so this got super
popular 20 kathleenlights started
recommending it
and Nelson and everybody was buying it
and reviewing it and talking about how
great it was and I was like I'm gonna
get that I'm gonna get that girl just
get to know what it is I my guess is
that it's probably one of those things
that I couldn't purchase from like all
the things like that I'm I'm guilty of
that very frequently I like to purchase
from Sephora or Ulta or even Target I
mean hang out targets got all these
brands comin which is super crazy and
exciting but I'm someone who's into that
so when I couldn't get the RCM a no
color powder like a berry it wasn't very
accessible to me it just kind of has
what put me off and then I used to
really really love powders and like
setting my makeup with these loose
powders and then probably about like
last year that kind of changed and I
went more towards pressed powders and my
loose powders started getting used less
and less and so I think just those
factors make me not do it my friend at
candis's sent this to me so that's why
for like girl how did you go through all
of that powder already she had been
trying it out and then she sent it over
to me but honestly when she sent it to
me I mean I feel like I've gone through
a pretty fair amount of this like I said
I probably been using it for a month
maybe it's been two months since I've
had it and I've been trying it a lot
because from the first time I used it I
was like dang it this is actually really
good and that's again coming from
someone who isn't into loose powders as
of lately but it is such a fine powder
and that's what I like when I put powder
on especially to bake I'd like to have
like the chunky powder on my under eyes
I feel like that can cause me to have a
flashback no matter if I'm using a
powder that everyone says it doesn't
have flashback I feel like if you use
too much and you don't dust it off
properly you're still gonna get that but
this one is just it is so nice on the
under eyes and it makes the under eyes
look so smooth and this is only I think
it's like $12 for a big ol 3 ounce jar
of it the packaging does suck I'll say
that I know a lot of people don't like
the packaging at the packaging that's
not good and they should change that up
for sure but this is a really freakin
nice powder totally wish I would have
jumped on that
for this next up I do have another
eyeliner and when when did I feature
this one I think this was in my most
recent PR products that I would and
would not repurchase with my own money
and I talked about the Schwing eyeliner
from the balm this is a liquid liner I
have to say thank you everyone who said
that you really enjoyed my story time on
this eyeliner because I if you guys
don't know I'm a published author I
legitimately have built my career on
being a storyteller that is my full-time
job and so I love incorporating my
little stories here onto YouTube but
then people are like your videos are too
long and I'm like I should put out the
storytime because that doesn't have
anything to do with the video but I'm
like I don't want to so what so many
people said my storytime was so fun on
this eyeliner I was like yes because
that came really close to being cut out
because that was already a longer video
but the Schwing eyeliner if you haven't
seen that video yet I'll link it down
below I have a storytime in it about how
great this eyeliner is I was intimidated
by this eyeliner because it doesn't have
the applicator that I prefer with my
liquid liner and I was really nervous
about it but I get the perfect wing
every single time I use this eyeliner
it's so easy to use there's no mess with
it it's very black it stays all day I'm
so impressed with this liner I did not
see this coming
I feel like I don't really hear anybody
talking about this liner I just saw
Casey Holmes mention it in one of her
monthly favorites videos and I was like
thank you someone else really loves this
liner - yes so yeah the Schwing eyeliner
from the balm I so wish I would have
been trying this sooner I actually have
a skincare product to talk about next
and this is from a pixie beauty and this
is the glow tonic ok so I have this like
mega daddy right here but with the glow
tonic I actually have a smaller guy as
well and when I got it I wasn't using it
on a consistent basis like I was using
it every once in a while here or there
and I was like yeah I think I'd like it
but you know skincare is one of those
things that especially if you're trying
to review something or see if it works
for your skin you do need to use it on a
consistent basis to see if it is working
in your skins liking it and all of that
and I felt like I wasn't giving my pixie
glow tonic a fair chance so then the
actually sent me pics they sent me this
big guy and it's super cute it actually
says Samantha's glow tonic on it which I
thought was super super fun I mean they
sent like a little pump to go along with
it as well but they sent it to me again
and I started seeing a bunch of people
saying how weird this product was how
good it was for your skin and I was like
I need to try that too so I started
using my little guy of it but I actually
can't find it but I know it's almost
gone because I wanted to really give it
a chance and use it very consistently so
my little ones almost gone and I'm
excited because I have this big one here
well I started using this like after
taking my makeup off I especially like
to pair this with the pixi peel and
polish is kind of like my routine that
I'm in right now but after I take all of
my makeup off I come back in with this
and I feel like it's getting any of my
extra makeup residue off my skin which
is really nice and then when you apply
this you can feel the skin kind of like
tingle a bit with it and I feel like
it's actually doing something it's
actually making something work but I
feel like it's been really nice and for
my complexion my skin's been really
agreeing with this guy too so this is
another one that I was like man when I
saw people you know really talking good
things about the glow tonic I wish I
would have put it in my skincare routine
sooner I'm trying to get more into doing
toners and such on my skin because I
hear good things about them and I think
the one from pixie is a really nice
product so next time I want to talk
about some lip products and these are
from Sephora the Sephora collection lip
cream at stains I've been recommending
these a lot lately I put them in my
Sephora vib sale recommendation video
I'm just really freaking impressed with
these these have been around for a very
long time I saw people such as Casey
Holmes once again do a fold like lip
swatch video way long ago and I remember
I watched that video like three
different times and even took notes on
which colors I wanted to buy and then I
just never did and I don't know why
because they're only $14 this is the
full size here there are only $14 which
I don't think is a bad price and then I
have this little set as well that has
four in here too and I really don't feel
like I have a good reason for why I
wasn't purchasing these but I didn't do
it and then finally I got this one and I
don't why did I even buy you I can't
remember what it was that I decided to
go ahead and purchase this I'm trying to
think now but this is a beautiful
beautiful color oh I think it was just
the last time I had myself I had a
support gift card and I was going
do a howl video and I was like you know
what you got a gift card even wanting to
try these out just do it so I finally
did this shade in 40 which i think is
like pink tea or something like that
it's a really really stunning like deep
pink nude I love it so much but I feel
like these are so long-lasting I had a
girls night out of town we were gonna be
eating sushi we were doing like wine
tastings and everything and I was trying
to decide which look what lipstick I
wanted to wear and this is what I wore I
love the color but I love the formula
and now I have a four more in here as
well so these are really good and I
would highly recommend up the Sephora
lip cream stains I so wish I wouldn't
tried them sooner and then the final
item that I want to talk about is a pair
of lashes actually these are from House
of lashes and these are the allure Lite
lashes I am so into these lashes and
they're definitely a pair that I'm like
I wish I would have stumbled upon these
lashes sooner because I keep wearing
them and keep wearing them and I think
that they are so beautiful I don't know
if you'd be able to see them the best in
the package and lashes that have already
been worn are kind of weird to like take
out and show they've already been cut
trimmed I've already worn him a bunch of
times but I was wearing them in again in
my PR I wouldn't would not purchase with
my own money so that video of course
will be linked down below I was wearing
them in that video and I just think
these are so freaking pretty and I just
wish I would have had them sooner so
again these are from house of lashes and
I really haven't tried a ton of
different styles from house of lashes
maybe only like two and then Babs Beauty
actually sent me a really really cool
package and she put in a ton of lashes
and I was like thank you so much girl
and I'm just slowly making my way
through all these lashes and having the
best time but thank you for putting in
the allure lights because I I don't
think this is necessarily a pair that I
would have seen online and been like yes
that's my style so I'm just I'm so happy
about these I don't know how the best to
describe them because they're not
necessarily like long or wispy which is
what I go for
they're more on the natch
lash for me which I don't gravitate
towards natural lashes hello but they're
more on the natural side for me but
they're just thing about them just
speaks to me and in that PR video so
many people commented on my lashes and I
was like thank you I love them too
I wonder buy more of these for sure they
are $12 for one on the house of lashes
website though I've got some new new
lashes that I just love I don't think
they would go with like every single eye
look but especially when I'm doing ilex
where I've been kind of in my videos
like not doing anything crazy with my
makeup I mean today I have glitter on my
face so there's that but when I'm just
doing like a really simple eyelid I just
want to put on a nice pair of lashes
that are dramatic enough for me but
they're not overly dramatic and these
are it so I have a feeling especially
for summertime when I'm going for those
kind of makeup vibes that I'm going to
be reaching for these elapsed a lower
light house of lashes wish I had you
seen her okay so that's gonna be
everything for today's video talking
about some makeup products that I wish I
would have tried out sooner because once
I started trying them I realized how
much I enjoy them I'd love to know if
you guys have any products as well that
you've been trying lately that maybe
they aren't new new releases but you
finally tried it out you were like ooh I
done messed up should have tried that
sooner I would love to know any of yours
in the comments down below but as always
if you guys did enjoyed this video I
hope that you'll give it a thumbs up I
hope that you'll also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
