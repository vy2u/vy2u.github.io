today's video I'm going to be chatting
about some items that is on my maybe
someday I will buy this list and let me
explain where this came from because
this is a little bit random and not on
my filming schedule when I was filming a
previous bill I buy a video I want to
save his last week so I buy it video I
made a comment about one of the products
in there and I said that's on my someday
maybe I'll buy that list and I didn't
even realize I said it in the video when
I was watching that back in editing I
was like what else is on my maybe
someday I'll buy this list it's not
necessarily a list where you know it's
you know focused on Sephora this isn't
my Sephora loves list this isn't my
luxury I'm going to spend a lot of money
on these products type of lists it's not
even like a cult favorites that I'm
going to buy one day kind of list it's
just a list with a few products I only
have a few products to go through today
so it's probably gonna be a shorter
video but it's just one of those things
where it's it's it's always on my mind
I've always been like I should buy that
someday someday maybe I will buy it so
like I said I just have a couple
products to go through here so if you'd
like to see what's on my list go ahead
and get started so the item that I was
talking about in my will i buy it video
that kind of sparked this idea was the
laura geller
highlights and i feel like i've talked
about the laura geller highlights in the
past that vary but they're just one of
those items that i hear a lot about
their items that i have had a laura
geller highlight in my hand at Ulta
beauty and I'm like I'm going to buy
this and then somehow by the time I get
to the front of the store I have ended
up putting it back it is $26 for one
highlight so I think that's kind of
what's always like I've always kind of
talked myself out of them even though I
have spent more money on one highlight
than $26 so I don't know what it is
about these laura geller highlights that
I'm like I'm gonna buy it no no I'm not
but maybe someday I will maybe someday I
did notice on the auto website they now
have mini highlights I've been seeing a
few more brands coming out with mini
highlights and I think that's a great
idea
highlights are almost impossible for me
to get through so when I see mini
products those are one of those menus
that I'm like I would get a mini
highlight so the mini highlights are $12
so maybe now maybe the next time
purchased from Ulta maybe al-arab it's
you know gilded honey I feel like is
what everyone has always talked about
when it comes to laura geller highlights
maybe I'll pick up the mini of them but
it was just kind of funny I was talking
about a trio and that will I buy a video
and I said Laura Geller highlights are
one of those products that maybe someday
I will buy okay so that's kind of what
gave you the idea for this video so I'm
definitely the Laura Geller highlights
but then when I sat down I was like do I
have any other products like this like
could I even make it into a video or
would it be like floral highlights
thanks for watching one of the first
products that popped into my head was
Mac blushes and I recently I think I
commented this on a YouTube video and I
think I also said it to someone on
snapchat like very recently within the
past couple of months and I've said I've
always meant to buy a Mac blush always
meant to try a Mac blush but I have
never I've never even tried a Mac blush
I don't own any I've never bought any
when I first started YouTube like first
started watching YouTube even before I
had a channel Mac was one of like the
most talked about brands on here one of
the first times I ever really kind of
like splurged on makeup it was at a MAC
store because I used to watch Carli
bybel religiously I mean I still do but
she was on the first youtubers she she
was the first youtuber then I started
watching and she was always using Mac
products and so one day I just made
myself a list based off her
recommendations and I googled where a
Mac store was because I didn't even know
went to Mac and bought a bunch of items
based on her recommendations but blushes
were one of those that I just never I
don't know why I just never bought like
now I've tried Mac eyeshadows and mac
lipsticks and you know of course I have
like the fix+ I've even tried Mac
pigments I mean all of these different
things I have a MAC lipstick and a lip
gloss on my lips today actually which
was not planned but I have never ever
tried the blushes and I really really
want to so Mac blushes though maybe
someday I'll know about you next up on
my list again when I was thinking about
items I was like yes this has been one
where I have had these lashes in my cart
so many times and I have not done it and
I really don't feel like I have a good
reason why it's the House of lashes
iconic lashes I feel like I hear a lot
of people talk about the iconic lashes
desi Perkins is one who is always
wearing their kind
clashes and so they've always been on my
radar they've always been something that
I've meant to buy I've just I've just
never done it
I have tried house of lashes House of
lashes lashes in the past that was
awkward to say but actually was my mom
who bought me a pair of lashes for my
birthday a couple years ago and I
actually said I'm pretty sure I said to
her I picked out like a couple different
styles and then just send em to her and
she ended up sending me the heartbreaker
lashes I think it was so I still have
never tried the iconic lashes but I
recently did the video of products that
I wish I would have tried sooner and I
actually had the allure light lashes on
their from House of lashes recently
discovered them for me I'm absolutely
loving these lashes I think that they
are so beautiful and I definitely want
to repurchase them so I was like when I
repurchase them I'm going to buy a pair
of iconic lashes I want to get the
iconic lashes and I also want to get the
iconic light flashes and Angelica I saw
your comment the other day as you told
me that I needed to try I'm pretty sure
you said the iconic lights as well so I
want to get both though I want to try
the eye comics and the economy lights
pick up another lower light but I feel
like the iconic lashes have been on my
maybe someday I'm gonna buy that list
for such a long time but it's kind of
ridiculous another item and this is one
where I don't know if I'm gonna do it
I don't I've always said like yes girl
someday someday you're gonna buy that
and you're gonna be pretty excited about
it
I don't know realistically if I will
though I'm just being honest here it's
the the big Natasha - no no palettes
do I need an eyeshadow palette that's as
expensive as the detection - no to
palettes probably not but there's this
thing there's this like feeling inside
of me and I'm not gonna sit down here on
camera lie about it there's this feeling
of I want one of those eyes shadow
palettes I do hear I hear conflicting
things on if it's worth it or not but
it's like the people who really enjoy
the Natasha - no no palettes they think
they are the best things like hands down
I I watched Casey Collins religiously as
well and she's done etosha I didn't
wanna pail it on her wedding day and I
mean I feel like that really says all it
was about how much she loves Natasha
monona so I don't know I feel like
people who really really love her
eyeshadow palettes really really love
them and just so highly read
I mean it would definitely have to be a
thing where I'm buying them at a sale
like that would have to be the one where
I would wait for the 20% vib sale not
just the 15% like I would need all the
extra savings I could get or maybe one
day I got a really sweet Sephora gift
card and I was like you know what I'm
gonna get one of those big pallets but I
don't it's it's always been on my list
every time she comes out with a new one
I kind of side-eye it for a while but I
always ended up talking myself out of it
but you know what maybe one day my
practicality levels will be low and also
come maybe I won't who knows the next
one is actually one that I put up right
away well when I was making this list
because this is an item that I have said
so many times yeah I'm gonna try that
soon I'm gonna pick that up soon and
when people are like hey have you tried
the Morpheus I think spam I'm like not
yet but soon I'm gonna purchase it and I
still just never have I think that one
is that now that morphe is sold at Ulta
if there's ever anything that I want for
more feet I typically get it from the
alte website or the office store versus
now the morphe website because I know I
can't remember with our minimum is it's
either 50 or $75 and a lot of times
because morphe is more affordable
whatever it is that I'm buying it's not
enough like I don't want to buy a $15.00
setting spray and then pay $8 for
shipping on top of it it just like hurts
my soul to think to do that why I don't
know I know some of you are like that as
well so like I said it's a $15 I think
spray but I just have not done it yet
and I hear really good things about it
and this is one that I feel like people
kind of continually ask me like have you
tried that would you recommend it I hear
this is good I'm like yes someday I'm
gonna buy it and I'm not what you know
what I think about it but I haven't done
it yet after let me know if you've tried
it like I mean I I don't know if I've
really heard any complaints about the
morphe setting spray I hear that it's
really good at making your makeup last I
hear that it has like the most excellent
mr. in the world on it because it's like
my aerosol can instead $15 it's not like
a terrible price for a setting spray and
I actually really as of lately I've been
getting into them more and more there's
very rarely a day that goes by that I'm
not spraying myself a setting spray I
just really like the fact that it's
giving my makeup but uh yeah maybe
someday I'll but the more few settings
back maybe some day
very less item I have is super random
especially for me I am not really a
perfume person at all I have I'm looking
at them right now I have four perfumes
for and I just enjoyed those those are
what I reach for I don't really like
experiment with new perfumes a lot like
once I find perfumes or scents that I
really love I typically I'm not just
going out and buying a ton of perfume I
work from home so usually it's just my
dog that has to like smell me and I
don't really try to impress her all that
much you know but when I go out I
typically like to put perfume on and
like smell a little better but I'm also
not someone who goes out a lot so I just
don't have a big use need fulfillment
for perfume in my life
but I hear people talk about the brand
Jill Malone a lot and again it's like
people who love Jo Malone fragrances
really love Jill Malone fragrances and
maybe I'm thinking about it because I've
just been binge watching all the Safari
vib recommendations videos now I'm
watching this far Bab haul videos and I
feel like I heard Jo Malone fragrances
mentioned a lot in the recommendations
now that I'm watching calls I'm seeing
what people did pick up from Jo Malone
and I'm like maybe someday I'll pick up
one of those perfumes
definitely what holds me back is the
price I mean there's there's different
fragrances and sizes and stuff and you
can get this on the Sephora website but
the majority of what I see is over $100
and I know that perfumes are expensive
in general especially you know kind of
these more high-end perfumes I know that
they are more expensive but it's still
like that's what makes it so hard for me
to want to purchase it especially
because I don't wear like maybe if I
wore perfume every day and I was really
good at like going through bottles like
I see people doing their empties videos
and they have like two bottles of
perfume I'm like how do you that fast
like I just can't do it so it's hard to
justify that price for me but I think
kathleenlights was just talking about jo
malone perfume I know Casey Owens I
think she purchased she recommended a jo
Malone diffuser and I'm not someone who
even uses a diffuser like now I have an
essential oil one but like the actual
diffuser was like the sticks in it I
used to use those all the time like
post-college
days I can't remember the last time I've
used one but even like she's
recommending it next thing I know I'm on
this far website looking at like I don't
even know what it was like a $95
diffuser or something I was like do I
need so I'm like girl forget it together
no you don't you wouldn't even use that
what are you doing and that's when I
started looking at the fragrances I
started reading like the different notes
of it and I was like step away from the
computer maybe someday you'll buy that
but it's not gonna be today that's
everything for today's video like I said
I thought it would be a shorter one but
it was just one of those things when I
was watching that video back in editing
and I said it kind of like click
something in my brain and I was like
could that be a fun video to do like let
me think about it and let me think about
what are some of the products that I
continually say to myself maybe someday
hopefully you've been playing a drinking
game during this video and you've taken
a drink every time I said that but that
I've said maybe someday I would make
this purchase and again not everything
is like high-end expensive a cult
favorite it's just kind of like a
mixture of all of those together so I
just thought it could be something fun
kind of like a casual video to do for
today I am pre filming a little bit
because I'm going to be out of town in
Oklahoma City for four days so trying to
pre film and some of these shorter
videos are easier for me so I can like
edit on a plane and in my hotel room and
all that fun stuff so I just thought
this would be a fun one hopefully you
guys enjoyed it let me know some of your
maybe someday I'll purchase that
products down in the description box or
let me know if we have any of the same
on our list but as always I hope that
you guys enjoyed this video are you
found it helpful or entertaining if you
did make sure to give this one a thumbs
up I hope that you'll also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys in at tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
