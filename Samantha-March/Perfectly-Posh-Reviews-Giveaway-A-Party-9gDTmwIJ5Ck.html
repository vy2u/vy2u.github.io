today's video I might say that in every
video but I am excited for this video
but today's I'm bringing you guys
another giveaway and I just closed the
big bookish giveaway that happened and I
wasn't going to do my beauty giveaway
for the beauty part of the channel for a
few more months yeah I'm still kind of
getting everything together I'm trying
to pick up some of the new like
spring/summer collection beauty items
from the companies out there but I was
approached by my friend Ashley and she
is a consultant with perfectly posh and
she asked if she could send a few items
my way to review on chocolate plus and
also on YouTube and then we also put
together a giveaway and a special party
for everyone watching so Ashley is the
cover designer from marching Inc she has
designed several of our book covers now
and she just recently did my book cover
for my fourth book and I just did the
cover reveal on my blog and I will leave
a link to that in the description box
because the book is called
up to I do and it's about a wedding and
I used one of my personal wedding photos
as the cover and that was my idea before
I even got married I was engaged but we
hadn't even got married yet and I was
like let's write a book about a wedding
and put our picture on there I thought
the book would actually like mirror my
own wedding and kind of be like going
through what I went through in wedding
preparations and it turned out to be
nothing like that it's about like a
super rich heiress marrying into another
super rich family then that's not me
what kind of course I've got a life of
its own but I still was able to use our
wedding photo on there and Ashley made
the cover so beautiful when she sent me
the final file I emailed back and said
well I'm crying so you did a good job
that is how I know Ashley and now she is
with perfectly posh and I had started to
hear about it a little bit from other
people and just from online and I saw
some videos reviewing stuff but
it has a lot of like pampering items
skinned feet lips body wash I mean it's
like items like that that you can buy
through the website there's a three-year
consultant and that sort of thing so
Ashley sent me a box the going over what
she sent me for review and I have used
some of the products so far so I can
talk about them I will have a full blog
post on chocolate plus going over each
item as well and what I thought of it
because by the time I write that blog
post I will have reviewed and tried
everything and then also on chocolate
plus will be the full how to enter the
giveaway it'll all be on that blog post
on chocolate plus so make sure you find
that in the description box below
because that will get you entered to it
and then I will also after I go through
everything and what you can win I'll
also explain about the party and how you
can get some free stuff from the party
ok first I'm going to talk about this
because when Ashley was kind of
questioning what it was that I liked and
you know what I might be interested in
to send me I went on the website and
kind of looked at things over and I
thought I thought I saw something in
particular and I didn't want to ask for
anything because I don't but when a
company or someone sends me something
for review I don't like to get very
particular about it I'm just like yeah
whatever you want to send like I'll try
it out and talk about it so I didn't say
this to her specifically but she sent it
to me and I opened up the box and saw it
was like ah I'm so excited and I've used
it but I saved like the packaging for
you guys so you guys can see what it
looks like but it's called the snarky
bar and this is the packaging snarky bar
it's citrus zest and Shea it loaded very
scrubby bar and it says it's made with
natural beads derived from sugar cane
and loofah this oh my gosh you guys I
used it last night in the shower and
even before I started to use this bar
you know it was in my shower and I was
shampooing my hair and all of a sudden
you could
start to smell the lemon and the zest
and it was oh my gosh it was like I was
in a spa or something and then the
actual bar has like exfoliant it has the
the natural beads they acted like an
exfoliator on your skin oh I lathered my
body up twice with that bar because I
was like this feels so good and I just
like stat there and usage on my feet and
I was like hmm
and I was like rubbing my elbows with it
because I've always you know I struggle
with like dead skin and like drive skin
around my elbows and I was using it on
my elbows in the shower and it smelled
so good felt amazing I am absolutely
absolutely in love with this if you guys
want to order anything from perfectly
posh please like order this and tell me
what you think of it or if you've used
it please tell me if you love it as much
as I do the shower and went down I told
my husband and he was like well can I
use it too and I'm like do I buy him his
old gun I don't want to share that is
just something I very highly recommend I
absolutely love it so far and I've only
used it once and I just feel like it's
gonna get better and the next thing that
I have in here that I haven't been able
to use yet because I just got this box
the night before but it's called the
heebie jeebie foot peel kit and I'm
quite curious to use this one oh let me
just open this so we can see what it's
all about so you have foot peel gel so
and this is one treatment and then also
in the box was this pair of socks units
let's see
so you apply half of the gel in the tube
to the bottoms of each foot and so
you'll use this entire thing between
both feet and then you place the booties
on each foot oh very smart
so then you place the booties over your
feet and then you put the socks on and
you wait an hour and then you remove the
socks and the booties and wash away the
gel and bath or shower
it says the peel will begin three to
seven days after initial application do
not forcibly exfoliate feet when peeling
begins peeling time may vary from person
to person and can take up to two weeks
to complete whoa okay so that sounds
really interesting
it says this vegan blend of natural skin
exfoliate her's penetrates deep to
remove years of dead skin on your feet
and toes old cracked dry skin simply
peels away to give you a week so soft
soft smooth feet about seven to ten days
after us oh if this works this is going
to be amazing because my feet I just you
know especially after went to have like
dry and cracked and I have like the
little exfoliator brush when I don't
usually go get pedicures I just paint my
toes myself because I can and I have
like the little like exfoliate or dead
skin type brush that I'm just like you
just feel like you're not on your feet
off and it's so frustrating and then in
the summer you want to wear like your
pretty shoes and your flip-flops and go
barefoot and you're like oh but my feet
don't look very cute I'm really really
excited to try this out you know it
sounds like it's gonna take a little bit
of time to do the application into
weight and then shower so I just haven't
been able to get to it yet since I just
got the box I'm really really looking
forward to that so I will let you guys
know go ahead and click that link to
read my full review on there because I
will let you guys know what I thought of
it and then the next thing that she sent
along is called Oh peaches for your lips
it's a super fabulous sugar scrub and I
have used this and I'm so excited it
says for your or when your puckers
tuckered out and I mean it really does
smell like peaches it just looks like
that on the inside but it's like a sugar
scrub for your lips and it smells really
good it smells like the peaches it's got
like the little greens and
they're that for the squirrel part for
your lips and this is another thing that
I was super excited to get because you
know I struggle with the cracked lips
and like the peeling lips and just the
other night I was sitting out a little
pitch game with my friends and I
realized I was like peeling off parts of
my lips I'm like oh that's really not
attractive please don't do that anymore
I had to get this it just says smooth
generously over lips and rub gently to
reveal supple sexy lips so that is Opie
chah's the super fabulous sugar scrub so
far I've used this several times and I
have nothing but good things to say
about it if you want to do a little work
on your lips not kylie jenner style just
you know go ahead and get it last thing
that I got is also a lip item and it is
the pinky melon Candide lip dye it just
comes in this cute little box and it
just looks like this and this is the
color so it's called posh pink let's see
it feels what's really it's really
smooth I don't know if you can see that
very well
so really smooth really creamy mmm what
smells really good
I don't want to eat it that and I don't
know if you can see all like my giant oh
look collection going on here but I
really do like Alypius so I was really
excited to get this one and it says
apply lip dye thickly to lips with
fingers or brush and it's supposed to
dry matte it looks like and this is
cruelty free no petroleum ingredients so
that is the lip dye so I'm excited to
give that one a try those are the items
that she sent for me to review and so
far in this video I can tell you that I
love that the snarky bar in the old
peaches a sugar scrub for your lips and
if you click the link to check lip plus
