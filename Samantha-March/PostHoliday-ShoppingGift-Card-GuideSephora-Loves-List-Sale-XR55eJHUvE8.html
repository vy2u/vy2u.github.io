merry Christmas everyone who celebrated
I'm actually filming this on Christmas
Eve but I have a plan to go up like the
day after Christmas or maybe like the
sunday after Christmas but I'm so
excited except for the fact that it's
snowing outside we were not supposed to
have snow we were actually told that our
forecast was supposed to be like 55
degrees on Christmas and a really like
unexpected Christmas weather and like
I'm said I'm filming this on Christmas
Eve it's snowing we had plans to travel
we don't know if the roads are like yet
so we actually don't know what our plans
are going to be now because of the
weather but I'm still excited I'm
totally in the holiday spirit I'm so
excited to hopefully see family tonight
fingers crossed but we'll see me guess I
hope everyone who celebrated had a
fabulous christmas i hope you guys are
getting excited for the new year i'm
getting excited for the new year but for
today's video i wanted to do something
hopefully that's a little bit fun I
talked to my snapchat friends and asked
if you guys like this video idea and
everyone said yes so I was like okay I'm
gonna do it but basically what i'm gonna
do is talk about what to maybe spend
your gift cards on that you've got for
the holidays and i wanted to do it
because you know we've been seeing
everyone putting out like gift guides
what to get your friends and your family
members and etc for the holidays but now
that's over you did your part you bought
everyone else gifts now you need to buy
yourself some gifts and i am already
like I've already received a few
Christmas presents and I've already
received also and sephora gift cards and
so what I thought to do was take you
through my Sephora loves bliss and just
kind of go through their talk about
what's on the Lovelace kind of talk
about like what's hot right now what are
the products everyone's talking about
what people are loving and you know
maybe some products that are kind of
expensive that you wouldn't normally buy
without a gift card but since you got a
gift card you don't feel guilty spending
it I know that's how I feel and then
I had an idea again I asked my snapchat
family and they said that they liked
this idea so everything that I talk
about in my eyes sephora loves list I'm
going to let you guys vote and I want
you guys the comment below and tell me
what your favorite product is that I
mentioned on the loves list and
whichever one receives like the most
votes the most comments I'm going to go
ahead and buy that product and that's
going to be included in my 1k youtube
subscriber giveaway so I want you guys
to be a part of it because I'm I feel
like I've been talking about the 1k give
away for so long and we're only at like
not even eight hundred followers but I'm
like I don't care i'm so excited for
this giveaway I love giving back I think
it's awesome and so I want you guys to
like what I'm giving away be excited
about it so I thought what better thing
then to like basically let you guys vote
and so I don't care what it is I have a
lot of different things on this lovelace
lashes palettes mascaras lip glosses I
mean whatever it is that you guys think
it's like the most bomb that you would
want to see in that give away comment
below on this video let me know I'm not
sure when you know maybe i'll leave it
open for like five days or so see what
you guys say and I'll take the one that
had the most votes and I will go ahead
and purchase it I won't wait I want to
purchase that one right away just in
case anything sells out purchase that
and then I'll have it in the 1k giveaway
do you guys like that idea I like that
idea massari this intro is so long let's
go ahead and hop into my spore loves
list and I really hope you guys like
this video okay and I am still
recovering from a cold i think it was my
last video that i was like i'm sorry
guys i'm sick i'm still sick my voice is
a lot better than it was yesterday I was
like maybe I'll film you know the day
prior that way I could edit it on
Christmas Eve and then we travel but my
voice was like not good I mean it's
still not great but at least it's
someone improving so the video might
look a little bit different i actually
got a tripod for christmas and so i'm
using the tripod for the first time and
i think it's a little bit like farther
away i can't get it like quite as close
yet but I messed around with it for
probably 30 minutes and then I was like
just filmed the video before you
completely lose your light and then
you're angry so two quick things but to
get into my
lovelace I have my handy-dandy surface
here that you guys know I love so much
have it here to help me out but the
first things that I have on my loveless
is the glam glow masks and of course
since these things are things that I
want to purchase I don't physically have
them here to show you I brought a few
items down that are either like similar
things like that that I can show you but
everything else i'll just post a picture
of over here I'm trying to like kind of
sit farther over here so i can post my
pictures over here but i don't know if
that's working because obviously i don't
have you find her yet um I guess glam
glove masks are the first thing actually
have one glam glow mask I think I
mentioned this in my recent um Sephora
haul and I have the thirsty mud
hydrating treatment and I just have this
little guy is nineteen dollars they do
have the full sized ones and those are
$69 but I was too nervous to buy him
because AI didn't know how fast i would
go through them be I didn't know if I
would actually like them like what if my
skin didn't react with them and then I
spent seventy dollars on masks that I
used once and can never use again but
i'm happy to say that I'm really really
happy with this glam glow mask in
particular and I don't know if you guys
will be able to tell that's what it
looks like on the inside now the thirsty
mask I thought was really interesting
because it's clear when it goes on and I
actually use it overnight I put it on
before i go to bed like after I've
cleaned my face put it on when I go to
bed I wake up in the morning and i
usually use like an oil to rinse it off
and my skin just looks better it really
does look better when i wake up the next
morning and so that made me super happy
so i have on my loveless both the flash
mud brightening treatment and then also
the power mud dual cleanse so it's the
orange one in the green one i have those
in my loveless and i'm definitely can
see myself getting more glam glow masks
another thing that i have on my love
list that is like duh who doesn't have
this on their love list is kat von d
everlasting liquid lipsticks now i have
like a variety of shades in there and i
do not have any of the kat von d liquid
lipsticks yet and i'm so bummed out with
myself but it was like every time I'd
get excited about a color or I'd see
something that I'd like it was sold out
like Lolita was sold out
the longest time when lolita was really
really popular is always sold out you
can get it anywhere I couldn't even
swatch it at the spores that we have
here in town couldn't even swatch it
because like the testers they had were
gone I'm like I know people are coming
in here and putting on their lips and
like going out I know you are I see you
and so I just have never been able to
find one that I really want to purchase
and see the colors that I have on my
loveless lolita now is back in stock at
the time that I'm filming this Lolita is
in stock so if you're wanting lolita now
it's the time to get it also they just
came out with a Lolita too and that is
also in stock currently at the time of
filming that is also in stock there was
like some sort of mix-up with Lolita
like it became so popular that they
tried to like make another batch and
they made it wrong and it came out like
a totally different color I think this
one is more on like the orange e side i
believe and people are buying it and
they were putting it on there like this
is not lolita so they ended up deciding
like people still like the color it just
wasn't the original lolita so they ended
up making a lolita too and they now have
that out as well so i have lolita on
here i have bow and arrow bow and arrow
i recently saw is a really good dupe for
one of the kylie jenner lip colors and i
can't remember which one now maybe it
was can't it was either candy or dulce I
mean it wasn't the true brown but it was
one of those that it was such a good do
for but bow and arrow is also another
one that was so popular like Lolita and
it's just been sold out I think you guys
can have everything outside by
interesting i also have a noble on my
love's list in Requiem which is a purple
like a light purple um noble I just saw
that Hannah Schroeder she does YouTube
as well she's in Australian I just love
her accent I feel like I just commented
on her video I think last night it was
like I love your accent makes me happy
but I saw an Instagram she posted a
picture with noble and I asked her if
she liked it and she said she really did
and she also said it was very peachy
which I'm into right now my eye on the
peaches and so I really want to get that
one
and as of time i'm filming it's sold out
because why not but yes i have a bunch
of the kat von d everlasting liquid
lipsticks on there as well i also have
some eyelashes on there so at sephora
they have a velour lashes collection and
those run for $23 and then i also have
some huge coup de la la la i have some
huda beauty lashes on there as well i am
actually wearing a pair right now of the
hooter lashes in Samantha obviously and
this is my first time really wearing
them I'm happy with them I cut them down
quite a bit because they were they were
pretty like long I wise and the inner
corners both gave me a little bit of
trouble but you know this first time
wearing it hopefully will become better
friends than more aware them but so far
first impressions I'm super happy with
them but those are also on my love list
because I would like to get a few more
of those and those are twenty dollars
for the hooter lashes and they have both
the Hoonah and the velour it's the bluer
silk lashes they have like several
different styles and I really like it
because they couldn't give you an idea
of what the styles are like what they
will be like I'm when I was looking at
the hooter lashes they're like these are
more natural lashes these are like kind
of in between these are the dramatic
lashes so I kind of like knew what I was
purchasing even though I was doing it
online so have a couple sets up
eyelashes in their kind of a random one
but I have the Sephora collection bright
future gel serum concealer on here and I
I don't really know why I do need a new
concealer i'm almost out of the
maybelline fit me and i also i love that
concealer i hear it's a great dupe for
the NARS like radiant creamy concealer
which everyone loves and I'm like heck
if it's a dupe I'm all about it I love
it its drug store but I don't know
something about this concealer it's
fourteen dollars which is more expensive
than the Maybelline but it's nothing too
crazy and I just really liked the names
of concealer like there
let me start with the lightest 10 maybe
maybe I'm just kidding so when we click
on all of them but they have like
fondant buttercream parfait a custard
and pie toffee like they just have like
really cute names and I thought that was
a lot of fun but it's I might just need
a new concealer and so I thought man you
know why not try something new I don't
really hear a lot of people talk about
it so I'm like is it because they tried
it and it's not good or just know what
it's really used it but I got a
concealer on there to have some more
skin care on there i have two different
like masks on their one is the fresh the
brand fresh it's their lotus youth
preserve face cream with super 7 complex
and that runs for 1650 and then i also
put on there with the sephora collection
their mud mask purifying and mattifying
I think kathleenlights just talked about
the Sephora collection one and I think
she said it was a do for one of the glam
glow masks I almost want to say and she
said that she really liked it and so
that's when I put it on my love list
because I was like 19 dollars versus
seventy dollars I'm Oh about that so I
have those two different masks I'm
really into skin care right now i just
bought a big first aid beauty kit that
had like cleanser in there and had
facial radiance paths that i'm all about
right now and had a vitamin miss that
you spread had a sleeping cream the
ultra like firming cream and i have seen
you guys asked me to do a review video
on that kit Sully and yes i will i have
it on my schedule i will be doing it on
there from the sephora collection i put
their face masks and i've been seeing
like people with pictures up sometimes
there's sephora ones are sometimes
they're the other ones but they're
almost like the just like the white mask
that you place over your face and it
looks like kind of scary but they have a
lot of them and there are only six
dollars and all the pictures show them
with two so I'm like is it six dollars
for two masks I'm not positive but
that's kind of what it looks like to me
but they have a lot of different like
things that the masks do like there's
moisturizing and soothing anti-aging and
soothing toning and revitalizing
anti-fatigue and energizing moisturizing
brightening you may have a lot of
different options to choose from and I
feel like these would be really good
especially like if your trip if you have
travel coming up you're flying on an
airplane or maybe even you're just like
long hours in a car you can just put
that face mask on and like let your skin
not get crazy like it'd be a good idea
so I just saw recently that tart put out
new lip colors and they're called the
TARDIS lip paints I think I first saw
this from luster lux she was just able
to go to like Turks and Caicos with tart
and it looked like such a phenomenal
trip I wash our snaps i watch the vlog
it looks so amazing but tart gave them
all like the beauty bloggers that one to
our beauty bloggers that went beauty
tubers whatever you call yourselves on
all these lip paints and she was going
through and likes watching them for us
and I really like their names their
names are like namaste you know I'm into
yoga so I really want to get that one
TBT funny so fetch selfish that made me
laugh adorbs love spell twerk I did not
know there was a torque a hangry I feel
like I need to buy that one too that's
Barry I should probably buy that one man
bun which i think is hysterical friend
of me wow I didn't know that one was
there either that is hilarious cray cray
and foam 00 foam oh I always have foam
oh you guys I kind of get that one too I
literally want to buy these like just
based on their names because that's
genius marketing but I'm already hearing
like I'm seeing more people start to
talk about them more of like the bigger
youtubers like that got them because
this is a very recent launch I'm I'm
pretty darn sure and I'm hearing that
they are pretty good there are twenty
dollars each so it says I'm looking at
it says you do have to be a vib rouge
right now to get these at Sephora maybe
you might be able to get them on the
tart website and tart also is on ebates
if you guys have ebates please please
have a base before you do any online
shopping I will have it linked below but
I know tart is also on ebates as well so
maybe you can get them through the tart
website I do not know that you had to be
a vib rouge to get these I'm not a vib
rouge I'm just a regular old vib darn it
but then that must mean that they're
launching soon and then everyone would
be able to get them but hot new
right there tardis lip paints cray fo mo
a whole pallets on here one is the vi's
art oh I lost it hold on my surface is
thinking we gotta let it think another
one I have on there is the vice our eye
shadow palette I have seen a lot about
these I saw they were especially popular
over halloween and there's like one
palette that is extremely bright has a
lot of bright colors in there but the
pallets are eighty dollars so if you
have like a bomb gift card that you got
you got like a hundred dollar gift card
or like some crazy like that and you're
like I really want to splurge on
something that I would not normally buy
I feel like an eighty dollar palette
would be that I don't know if I would be
able to purchase an eighty dollar
palette because like that's a lot to me
I'm totally in love with my Kat Von D
shade and light palette and my morphe
35o palette I use them all the time at
this moment in time i don't know if i
needed to introduce a new palette into
my life because i already have so many
colors between those two pallets that I
don't know if I'd know what to do but I
have seen a lot of people talk about it
so a few of these things on my love list
are things that either a like I really
do want or I just think it's like hot
and new and I want to tell you guys
about and get you guys excited about it
too okay it's art ones I've seen a lot
of bottom from the other youtubers if
you're looking for a splurge eighty
dollars maybe try them out another
palette I have on here is from make up
forever and it is there 15 artists
shadow palette this one is $59 so again
that's very expensive but i also have
heard a lot of really good things about
this one and it does look like it has
some interesting shades in there like it
has some neutrals and some good
transition colors then it looks like it
also has a few like really bright colors
and there as well so you might be able
to do a lot with it yeah that's another
palette that I have on here ok so I'm
mascara i have on here is the benefit
they're real mascara and i actually have
like a little guy of this mascara it
came in i have a benefit box it came in
the box and i absolutely love this
mascara i do not understand how i still
have any left because i think i bought
the box in the summer and i still have
mascara in here and I'm like thank you
Jesus because once i'm out i have to go
get more this mascara is so good its
twenty four dollars for the full size
but i have that on my list if you guys
like you know more higher-end mascaras
this is definitely one that i recommend
our item i have on here is the cover FX
stem covered drops yes like it in the
youtube community i see a lot of people
using them so i put them on here they
are forty four dollars so that's pretty
expensive again but again if you got
your gift cards you did your holiday
shopping now it's time for you time for
you i have a couple items from tart on
here so i actually don't have anything
from tart and i don't know why that i've
never gotten anything from them but i
don't know if it was from like the
lesser luxe trip and she was just
talking about tarde a lot or if they're
just like Alison coming out with much
great products but I have my I hard I'm
tart I really wanted to get their
holiday blush palette it was like that
really blingy pilot I think it had five
blushes inside my voice you guys i feel
like i'm talking like through a can or
something like and yeah yeah me hello
yeah have their TARDIS contour palette
on here and it is $45 but it's a really
cute contour palette now the first time
i looked at this it's that only vib
rouge could get it it does not say it
right now so everyone should be able to
get this one right now but it looks
really good it's like you got your
contour shades looks like you have a
blush shade in there maybe you have a
highlight shade in there SAT a highlight
shade ya got highlight in there you got
your setting powders in there I just
think it looks really cute i really like
the gold packaging I think it looks
really good I'm into it I don't have any
actual
who are pallets right now I broke my BH
Cosmetics one like last year and I've
never replaced it but from Tarte on
there i have just there Amazonian clay
their 12-hour blush now this is
twenty-eight dollars for one blush and
to me that's a lot of money for a blush
when I like I love Milani blushes I just
want the luminoso blush from Luke from
Manila from Milani and I'm like yes girl
give that to me give me more and I don't
name was like five or six dollars and I
also really like the color pop color pop
blushes and I think those are like eight
dollars so to spend almost thirty
dollars on the blush I'm like what but
everyone says that it really does last a
long time the packaging is very cute but
that's why I really wanted that five set
to like try them out it was cheaper I
was into it couldn't get it sold out
right away I was bummed so yes the Tarte
Amazonian clay 12-hour blush is on here
also from Tarte is the tartlet in bloom
clay I shadow palette this looks like a
very neutral warm palette I've been
seeing a lot of people use it and makeup
tutorials recently a lot of holiday
makeup tutorials was done with this
palette and I just had my eye on it
thought maybe it was something you guys
might like another palette I have on
here is the Too Faced chocolate bon bons
palette is a brand new palette it is
forty-nine dollars so that's pretty
expensive again but it has some like
kind of crazy colors in here look
there's like a really like hot pink in
there type thing I don't know I just
think it looks interesting the shadows
are in little like heart pans we know
that two-faced comes out with like the
cutest packaging and the whole wide
world and so I feel like the bonbon
palette it's going to be talked about a
lot more as more people are getting
their hands on it and able to do makeup
with it so that's on there too two more
things from to face I have they're born
this way foundation on there I have
wanted to try this on Dacian for the
longest time right now I only use
drugstore foundations I use the
Maybelline fit me the maybelline fit me
mountain poreless L'Oreal True Match
Lumi i have i have like four or five
Mayline foundations because i'm crazy
then i also have the darker l'oreal true
match foundation that I used drops in
for if I'm Tanner 5 selfed and kind of
helped me
you makes imagine my foundation to get
it right but I don't have any high-end
foundations I hear a lot of good things
about the born this way that it just it
looks like your skin look better so I'm
really interested in trying it I just
haven't taken the plunge yet it's $39
like I think the Maybelline foundation
is like underpin so I just haven't bit
the bullet yet if this is the product
that gets voted on that you guys love
the most I will probably have to wait to
buy the foundation until I announce a
winner so you guys can tell me what your
foundation shade is because obviously
I'm not going to like go out and buy a
foundation and then it doesn't match you
and then that was pointless so quick
disclaimer if you guys pick the
foundation from to face is there love
flush long-lasting 16-hour blush this is
twenty-six dollars these come in like
the little heart shape pallets or you
know heart-shaped pans and I just think
they look so cute again just supposed to
be a really good blush I hear it's very
similar to the tart blush it's in the
same price point 26-28 I don't know they
look pretty they look like they would be
like good decorations and like if you
have a makeup room it'd be good like
decor in there so I put that one on
there as well then a few things from
make up forever you guys are gonna have
a lot to choose from I hope you don't
mind got a lot of ideas for your gift
cards a couple things from Makeup
Forever their skin equalizer primer they
have a lot of these different primers
they are thirty-six dollars for full
size which is expensive but i believe
they also have like smaller sizes that
are much cheaper which is probably what
I would go with primers I see everyone
using them I see the smoothing one I see
the hydrating one being used seems like
people really really enjoy these and
then also their makeup forever the ultra
HD invisible cover stick foundation it's
$43 and it means just a stick foundation
people just kind of use the stick put it
all over their face and then blend it in
with a brush and I've been watching I
think they this is a new product as well
the thing they just sent it out to a
couple of youtubers and I've been seeing
a lot of like first impressions and
they've all been really good so far I
don't know if I've ever used a stick
foundation and I don't know if we would
get along well but it seems like people
are really liking it so something
that you might want to get laura mercier
I put on there they're translucent
setting powder I do have this little guy
of her secret brightening powder and i
have it on on my under eyes right now
and I really really like the brightening
powder but I've also heard amazing
things about the translucent powder and
people are swearing by it people
absolutely love it so I have it on here
it's thirty seven dollars which again of
course is expensive we got a gift cards
or being selfish right now we're being
selfish I'm Nastasia Beverly Hills I put
the brow was on here it's $21 I'm very
new in the eyebrow game right now I only
have like um brow gel on my eyebrows I
don't have I do have the NYX micro brow
pencil but I don't have that going on
today it just takes me so much time
because I'm so new to it like I really
gotta like Aunt myself up what I'm gonna
do my eyebrows because I'm so afraid of
it but everyone loves the anastacio
brought was everybody loves it you
should love it too from stila I have
their stay all day liquid lipstick this
is twenty-four dollars for a liquid
lipstick I have swatched quite a few of
the stellas in the forest that we have i
no steal a patina is like a superduper
popular color if no faster all night
again hey I wanted to include these on
here I don't feel like stila gets talked
about as much like they're kind of lost
in the kat von d and I Nastasia the dose
of colors all that stuff I don't hear as
much about stila except for steelo
patina so if you guys do choose like a
liquid lipstick to be a part of the
giveaway I'll say like maybe what color
like maybe we'll do like a snapchat boat
you guys can tell me what color you like
you're like that idea swing in it now
