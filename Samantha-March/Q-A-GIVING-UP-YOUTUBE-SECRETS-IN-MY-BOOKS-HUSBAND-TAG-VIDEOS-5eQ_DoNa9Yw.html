don't we go ahead and jump into the Q&amp;amp;A
okay so I'm going to start with a couple
of Twitter questions that came in right
when I announced that the Q and I had
won the poll so this is from my friend
pink ahead girl
so she says the first question how did
you manage to build your company
marching Inc so early in your life so I
started my company marching Inc in 2010
I believe 2010 was when I like filed all
the paperwork to create an LLC and
marching Inc was originally designed as
my publishing company I did own a
publishing company for several years I
closed it last year I was publishing
books for other authors and now I'm just
publishing for myself and I
decided to start marching in because I
just always knew that I wanted to own a
business I always knew that I wanted to
do something for myself and I always
knew that a traditional job a corporate
job a desk job anything like that it
just was not for me I've known that from
a very very early age so when I decided
to really make a go for it and decided
to really be serious about publishing
books I wanted to have it under my own
imprint like I was never the person that
wanted to be traditionally published I
didn't want an agent I definitely have
like an entrepreneur spirit and that was
always what I was interested in so
that's kind of why I decided to start
marching Inc
what's the publish my own books but then
it's fallen under the other categories
like when a file might actually know I'm
under an LLC because I do have a lot of
other smaller businesses under that
umbrella too so that's kind of why I
started I just wanted to be a girl boss
from a very young age before it was a
hashtag okay another one from Twitter
this is Teresa she said what made you
start filming videos for YouTube I
actually when I first started my youtube
channel I started it as a spin-off of my
blog which is chiclet plus comm which is
mainly a book blog when I started to
flip plus I had in mind that I wanted it
to encompass everything that I have
interests in such as books Fitness
beauty fashion lifestyle celebrity like
I wanted it to encompass all of that I
kind of got away from it over the years
because I would get so much feedback
saying like people that take me
seriously because I would write beauty
articles I needed to focus solely on
books and I really listened to that and
I'm upset with myself that I did but
it's okay because I got back on track so
I decided to start YouTube because I was
watching other YouTube videos like I
feel games really late to even watching
YouTube videos I was very late to that
game but when I finally did I just was
so inspired and I would watch up a few
those videos and just think I can do
that like I totally can do that and so
when I started out with well you know
start with what you know and I know
books and I know writing so a lot of my
first videos for book reviews and like I
did book mail all the books that I get
from publishers and authors and you know
how I write a book and how to market
your books and things like that but
I didn't have the spark for my youtube
channel for books like I did have the
spark for my blog it just wasn't
translating the same and I also wasn't
getting a lot of support which was kind
of a bar because I've been in the book
industry since 2009 and I feel like I've
made a lot of really good friends and
good connections but it was like when I
started YouTube no one really was
supporting me over here and it was kind
of like whew what's going on and then I
was like you know what I'm tired of like
listening to everybody tell me I can't
do all the things I want to do because
I'm someone who firmly believes whatever
it is you want to do you can do it like
we live in a world where you can make
your own opportunities the hardest part
I think for people is to figure out what
it is you want to do but once you've
figured out once you know you just got
to go for it it sounds like you know
what I'm done with people telling me
that I can't be this and I can't be that
so I changed it I started to add in more
beauty videos like I would do to book
videos a week and then one beauty video
and the beauty videos the reviews were
so much higher than my book ones of
getting more subscribers when I would
post Beauty videos and just having more
conversations and interactions and so I
was like ok I'm changing it and it was
about one year ago that I switched to
fully a beauty channel and you know
those are the only videos that I post in
our Beauty related videos and I've seen
a lot of success from it so that was
definitely a lesson to me that you know
don't let other people tell you what to
do with your life or tell you how to run
your life you just got to do it for you
so another Twitter question this is from
Celia Willa
hopefully I'm saying that right she says
do you have any secrets in your books I
don't think I have any secrets in my
books now off the top of my head I can't
think of like ever writing a secret
sometimes I can write more freely of how
I feel like maybe if I was having like
an argument with someone I'm able to
express it better in a book than I am in
conversation but my 7th book so not the
book that I'm currently writing but the
one that I'm currently plotting out my
seventh book that will have a situation
in there that I kept secret from a lot
of people for a very long time I will go
into more detail in that book
and have the characters kind of reenact
something that I went through that I
didn't tell a lot of people so book
seven come soon she'll sauce how many
hours do I write it just depends on
where I'm at in my schedule some days I
don't write at all some days that's the
majority of my day some days I can get
in thirty minutes and that's it it just
depends on where I'm at with that and it
depends on where I'm at with other books
if I'm running certain promotions for
them if I'm plotting out a book it just
it just really really varies on my
schedule she also has my favorite book
as a child I loved the baby-sitters club
like I loved the baby-sitters Club books
like back when I was doing book videos I
have a whole video about my favorite
babysitter Club books because that was
like my favorite series ever
what is your pet peeve negativity drives
me crazy do I have any bad habits well
I'm sure I'm sure I have a ton about
habits I'm very much like a clutter
person which I know drives my husband
crazy like I can you'd be wearing a
shirt
take it off throw it on the floor grab
another shirt put it on don't like it
take it off throw it on the floor grab
another shirt I mean my closet is a
disaster all of the time and my office
is typically usually a disaster as well
but I don't know I can't do this thing
where I like grab something then put it
back nicely it's just not for me and
then she also asks do I have or what are
my strengths and weaknesses I think some
of my strengths are that I'm pretty
independent
I'm very hardworking I have a lot of
self motivation I work from home you
know I own my own business I write my
own books I don't have an editor or
publisher with deadlines telling me when
I need to be finished I get these books
out on my own so I definitely have a
good work ethic I think my weaknesses
sometimes it drives me crazy how
sensitive I am like the smallest things
really can bother me
not a lot look like negativity when it
comes with social media though that I'm
pretty good at letting light roll off my
shoulders it's more like things in real
life like I don't know I can just like
the smallest things that like my husband
sends me or my mom or a friend like
it'll just stick with me and ride all
the time which is super annoying and
then also another weakness is that
sometimes I don't know when to stop like
sometimes I can kind of run myself into
the ground because I can doubt myself a
lot I feel like it
really hard when you are fully
self-employed because you never know
where your next paycheck is coming from
you know your months are always
different so much they are amazing some
months are amazing some what they're
terrible some ones are ok and it's just
it's a very stressful like I love what I
do and I'm so appreciative that I can
work from home and I have this office
and I'm doing what I love but it's also
very stressful and it can make you doubt
yourself I mean you have those bad
months I can just get into a funk and be
like what did I do I need to go back to
a real job like how am i surviving on
this type of thing so I can kind of get
in my own mind and doubt myself and get
really down on myself but um I figure
out a way to turn around I figure it out
so a couple of snapchat questions is
from Danielle hey girl
she said my question for you is would
you ever do a husband Tech or any sort
of husband video that is totally up to
me that's 100% up to my husband his name
is Mitch Mitch is just not like a social
media guy I don't really know if he
would be ever be up to it you guys don't
see him on my snapchat a lot because
that's not really like who he is and
that's not really his personality but
totally be up to him if you would ever
do a tag video with me I have no idea if
he would if you guys want to see any
sort of cosmetic videos they made some
comments down below I can share those
with them and maybe it would convince
them but yeah I'm leaving us up to him I
would never like try to pressure him to
do it because if it's not in his comfort
zone I wouldn't want to take him out of
his comfort zone because then you
wouldn't be getting his true self on
camera he'd probably have to have a
drink or seven before we did a video
regardless but yeah maybe someday but
probably not soon all right the next
question is from Mickey a girl she says
with all that you've been through how do
you keep up your self esteem and self
confidence you seem very comfortable in
your own skin and that's remarkable
assets a hard life you have lived I did
share my story I'm snap chat a couple
weeks back so I don't know for me
honestly I think a big part of it has
just been like getting older I just
turned 30 which is super fun but
honestly I feel like it's taking me a
lot of years to understand what it is I
really want in life to understand how to
go for it and understand that I feel
like I used to be a person that was very
afraid of rejection all of the time like
I was that person that would be too
afraid to go for
something or asked for something because
I was too afraid of hearing no and now I
understand like if I don't ask for it if
I don't go for it I'm not going to get
it no one's going to change my life for
me there was there was a lot of times in
my life where I thought that like karma
would come back around and like change
my life for me like I was just waiting
for because I've gone through so many
about them so I was like clearly
something has to change and you know
someone's going to come along and change
my life and I finally realized that if I
wanted to make a life change I was the
only one I was going to do it and it
took me definitely a lot of years to get
there and also what's feeling more
confident is that I just realized that
if to me if you're not your own biggest
cheerleader then something is wrong like
you have to be your biggest motivator
you have to be your biggest cheerleader
and you have to just believe in yourself
even when you have those days where
you're like I'm horrible I'm messing up
my lives like stays crazy like if you
follow me on snapchat you know I can get
like really dramatic for at least an
hour and then I figure out that like
life will actually go on but to me when
I realized that like I needed to always
keep my motivation up I always needed to
be my cheerleader things really started
to change I also asked when you go to
Disneyland what's the first Fried you
want to go on the one you've been
waiting to do your whole life I have no
idea I love rollercoasters but I really
love like water water rides as well so I
don't know I'd want to go on a mall I
love water parks I love theme parks for
my bachelorette party we went to a water
parks because that's what I wanted to do
like I'm still all about it I would love
to go to Disneyland one day I'd be
awesome so I believe this is from April
hi she says when did you first get into
makeup and when did you say that you
wanted to do a YouTube channel I've
always really been into makeup a big but
I never knew how to like put it on or
apply it I was loved you mad as like a
little girl going into my mom's making
my grandma's makeup oh poor grandma I
would go through her makeup all of the
time
but I was like even as I got older I'd
go to the beauty aisles and I would buy
things that I had no idea how to use and
I kind of always held myself back
because I'm not very artistically
creative and I feel like being
artistically creative or somewhat
creative is a big part of makeup and I
felt like I never got it I'm terrible at
art drawing painting imagining things I
mean it's just it's just not me
and so when I would try to do makeup and
I want to get it right I'm like well
obviously I'm not because I just can't
do it you know I'd get so down on myself
and I wouldn't even try it and again I
just finally got to a point where I was
like you know what I've always been
interested in this i watch the videos I
read articles I write articles you know
I write reviews like I just need to
figure it out and I just sat down and
Marcia a ton of YouTube videos and kept
practicing and not a fantastic by any
means today but I still practice and I
still enjoy it and what's funny to me is
that I actually now really enjoy the
process of putting on makeup because I
like the creativity that it allows me to
express it's a completely different
creativity from writing a book but they
both help keep me in that creative zone
and you know I'm just a creative person
even though I might not be able to like
draw or you know do art in that way I
definitely am a creative person and I
just kind of had to like unlock that for
myself but I'm really happy that I did
and then her other question was when did
you decide you wanted to do a youtube
channel it was about two years ago and
then last year I changed to the fold
Beauty Channel so this question i screen
charted it but it didn't come up with a
name so I'm sorry about that but the
question is will you film an update at
work routine video you filmed one one to
two years ago when you first write
YouTube and I really liked how you
explained your organization and time
management in that video would you guys
want to see a work routine video either
I don't know how I would do a work
routine video or how I organize my day I
don't know let me know or something vlog
style I've never blogged before let me
know what you guys think about that in
the comments down below
okay that was a video I didn't realize
just going to be video I was trying to
click my volume up she's that if I were
to change my hair color what would it be
and then she also said what kind of
movies do you like if I were to change
my hair color I don't know I haven't
done my hair in a very long time I
always used to wanted to diet like very
very blonde I used to be very blonde and
then I'm just kind of more into like the
dirty blonde
was my this was my natural hair color
underneath I always leave that alone but
I've always kind of wanted pink hair I
just recently got a pink wig diet cannot
the girl for the life of me I do not
know how people wear wigs I don't
desperately trying kind of movements do
I like comedies I like comedies I like
to laugh I hate scary movies I hate sad
movies
I just want to laugh and like be happy I
can't take that way which I'm way too
sensitive for that okay this one is from
Rosie she says where do you see yourself
in ten years and what's your favorite
thing to do in your free time besides of
books and makeup so where do I see
myself in ten years I never really know
because I feel like I literally feel
like twice a year I get a new idea of
what I want to do or new business plans
that I want to start or something like I
feel like I'm just constantly changing
and evolving and I feel like that's
really exciting
I don't feel like I'm ever very good at
like locking myself into one thing but
in ten years I'll be 40 so that's cool
but really I always when I get asked
this question of you know where do I see
myself in the future I just really hope
that I'm still pursuing things that I
want to do and just building the life
that makes me the happiest that's that's
just really really what I hope for and
then she said besides books and makeup
what do I like to do in my free time I'd
love to work out I'm really big into
fitness really love yoga I love to
practice yoga I've been thinking about
something a couple fitness videos which
I think would be really fun let me know
if you guys like that idea in the
comments down below but I love working
out and eating ice cream that would be
those are those are my other passions in
life this one is from nobody
Karen's she says what is your favorite
YouTube influence our brand collab my
favorite influencer brand clouds that's
tough ones like my most recent favorite
one I think would have to be the Casey
and Smashbox cosmetics spotlight palette
I got my name pearl it's so freaking
good it's so freakin good like KC did a
Bob job on that I also really like my
Jaclyn tell and Becca cosmetics face
palette with the blushes and the
highlights I absolutely love that one
those are some of my favorite smells
good questions I've been waiting for the
storm to roll in the entire time I've
been filming this video and it is here
I've had my ring light on the whole time
but it's probably a lot darker now
because I don't have a backlight on but
I'm just going to go ahead and wrap up
this Q&amp;amp;A before things get really crazy
out there my question is did you ever
think about giving up on YouTube before
you made it and if so what made you keep
going I don't know if I want to say like
I feel like I've made it or anything
like that I mean I work really hard and
I think I've seen really good results
from working hard so I think that's good
but she said did you ever think about
giving up there was a couple times in
the beginning when I was mostly just the
book channel because it was kind of I
would get down on myself because you
know there wasn't like the support
coming in like maybe I thought it was
going to and that kind of bummed me out
but another reason that I kind of
thought maybe of stopping was because I
wasn't finding as much joy in some of
those videos as I thought that I would
because I get excited every single day
when I write a book review I get excited
when I start reading a book I enjoy it
like that the reason I started my blog
was to be able to connect with people
who were like minded like me because I
didn't have a lot of people in my real
life that really enjoyed reading like I
did and I wanted to have discussions
with people about books and that was a
big reason why I started my blog and so
I just figured that that enthusiasm
would translate over into a YouTube
channel and it really didn't and I just
didn't find the joy not only it you know
I don't even like even in the beginning
when I only had like 5 subscribers like
obviously I didn't have a lot of views
but it just wasn't like fun for me
making the videos and that's kind of
what threw me off and then when I
started making the beauty video like I
don't feel like there's ever been a day
where I'm like oh man I need to film
again today you know I'm always super
excited I love doing this I love talking
about what I'm talking about so it just
the beauty videos just really translated
by
and how to say that I don't enjoy books
obviously because I still read every
single day I'm always talking about
where I'm reading I still up my blog I
still have all my chocolate plus social
media pages it just for whatever reason
did not translate into YouTube and that
was only part that made me want to give
up because I wasn't finding happiness
with it and she said if so what made you
keep going it was that I finally decided
you know to explore this other passion
that I had and to finally give it a go
so that's what made me really not give
up and then really glad that I made that
decision so I'm really glad I'm here and
I'm really thankful for all the
relationships that I've made so I'm glad
that I didn't give up okay this is
probably gonna be the final question um
what this is from a pink cloud 2013 and
she said what's the first beauty brand
you've ever used and what's your
favorite beauty product currently the
first beauty brand I ever used no I'm
trying to think it's probably something
along the lines of like Maybelline I can
remember using Maybelline at back in
high school or even like my mom used to
wear Avon quite a bit so I would use
like her Avon makeup so those are like
the first two brands I can really
remember the first high-end makeup
purchase that I ever made was from Too
Faced I bought they're primed and
poreless primer and also one of their
eye palettes I actually used to like be
an affiliate for to say it's not an
affiliate what am I trying to say I used
to be like a product reviewer for Too
Faced way back in the day when I was
still doing the beauty reviews and posts
on my blog chocolate plus before I'd
moved that to mostly an all book blog I
would do Beauty reviews and toofus when
they were a new company contacted me and
asked me and I wrote reviews for them
they send me the very first better than
sex mascara for me to try out and post
photos up this was before YouTube this
was all done on my blog and yet QVC
Sesenta makeup way back way back in the
day now two phases like girls and I'm
like stupid this business you said
what's your favorite beauty product
currently it's like the hardest thing in
the world to say my favorite beauty
product currently I mean I don't I'm
looking around my office like what is it
that I love I can see three boxes of
pure eyelashes sitting out
I wear pure lashes every single day and
Center on they just came out with lashes
I feel like it's so bright this is the
first time I'm using my new ring light
but they just came out flashes I'm
completely obsessed with them I love
lashes I wear lashes almost every single
day doesn't matter from a social media
are not gonna wear lashes and the pure
lashes are amazing though I'm going to
wrap it up there for the qat it is going
crazy outside we are in severe weather
risk right now so I'm going to go will
pop on the TV and make sure I don't need
to be like taking cover and I'm sitting
in front of a window with the ring line
probably that's probably not the best
place that I could be right now but
thank you guys so much thank you to
everyone who asked questions and thank
you for requesting this Q&amp;amp;A I hope that
you guys enjoyed it and maybe learned a
little bit more about me but let me know
what you thought in the comments down
below what you thought of the Q&amp;amp;A and
again just thank you I haven't done a
Q&amp;amp;A for in a while because I just didn't
know if people really want to so cute I
probably so that was really exciting
when I thought being requested and then
for to win the Twitter pulled just like
gave me all kinds of feels so thank you
guys thank you so much for sending in
your questions I really do appreciate it
