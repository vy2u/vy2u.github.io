today's video is going to be a queue and
I feel this video has been in the works
for a very long time and I kind of kept
putting it off because I was like I
don't know do people really want to see
like me answering questions like who
really cares right and so as I would get
like new products to review or new
makeup tutorials or things like that I
was like let's put those before the Q&amp;amp;A
let's put those before the QA but I was
like I really really need to get this
filmed because it has been requested but
also because questions have come in like
back a few weeks ago when I thought that
was going to film it I asked for
questions on like Instagram and YouTube
and I got so many questions in and I was
like I can't just keep doing those
questions like you have to get over it
you have to stop being so intimidated by
a QA you just need to do it so that is
what today's video is going to be I do
actually have a few questions from
snapchat that I'll probably go through
first and then I'll move on to Instagram
and then i'll head over to youtube to
answer some questions that were left on
a video a whole day i will get through
as many questions as i can if you did
ask me a question thank you so much i
really appreciate it q and A's are
honestly some of my favorite videos to
watch because I feel like we're getting
to know the people that were watching on
camera a lot better and you realize
certain things about them you guys will
find this interesting as well but I just
want to happen to it because I know we
have a lot of questions to get through a
cell I hope you enjoy my Q&amp;amp;A and that
came in is from Danielle he says how
does your husband feel about your
YouTube channel and as he watched them
and would you / he consider doing the my
husband does my makeup challenge yes he
subscribed to me helps me fill my videos
like my lookbook he filled the entire
thing for me and he's really supportive
in that way I am very much someone who
is always trying to think of something
else to do I am self-employed I work
from home and I always have a different
idea to do that I want to try and
YouTube was an example of that and I
think he's kind of used to it like he's
used to me always like maybe we should
try this maybe we should try that maybe
we should do that and he's always very
supportive of it I don't
he always understands the way that my
brain works and sometimes is like what
girls like do you ever rest or do you
ever just like take a breath and it's
actually kind of a good thing because if
I didn't have him there to be like hey I
think I you need to take a break hey you
need to eat dinner like if I didn't have
him there to kind of like balance me out
i would probably be burned out very very
fast so he kind of like can keep me
focused and keep me away from work when
I need to be away from work so I'm very
much appreciative to him for that and
would we ever do the my husband does my
makeup challenge it was really funny
because he was actually next to me as
that question came in and so I read it
off to him and he was like you want me
to do your makeup on camera let me let
me show you how I'll do your makeup on
camera and he's a big fan of The
Simpsons and he pulls up a Simpsons
video on youtube of like Bart no Homer
Homer I clearly don't watch the simpsons
of the main guy and he made a gun for
women to do makeup with and you shoot
the gun and it puts paint make up on
their face and that was what he wants to
do so um no is my answer right now but
maybe that will change but uh yep that's
what he showed me so that's how he would
plan to do my makeup if he could make
one of those makeup guns so there's that
I did not screenshot a name on this one
oh I'm so sorry about that first time
doing this but what advice do you have
to anyone who wants to become a beauty
influencer on YouTube probably my
biggest piece of advice would be to just
do it and to just start it i'll say
that's my biggest piece of advice for
anything that you want to do i am an
author and the the main question that i
get is you know that same question i I
want to be an author I want to write a
book what what is your advice is to just
do it just sit down and start to write
it same thing with beauty and youtube if
that's what you want to do you just need
to start it once you get started you'll
be able to quickly realize if it is
something that you want to do or not and
like I said like I have a lot of ideas
and I like to try a lot of different
things and there's been a lot of things
that I've started and try it out and
been like ooh you know what I actually
don't really like doing that or I don't
find a lot of joy in that and I'll
doing them but at least I tried so just
trying and starting out is probably just
the biggest thing and you'll quickly
realize if it's a good fit for you and
if it is and if it's something that you
love doing then you won't want to stop
doing it so that would be my advice this
is from Kelly or que Bella beauty she
says you've mentioned that you had a bit
of a strange relationship with your
family do you have a better relationship
with them now so um did a snap a while
back and I was talking about my
relationship with my younger brother and
just about how we used to not really
have a relationship and now we do and
how great it is and you know he gave me
away at my wedding and all this stuff so
um yeah so I have had a strained
relationship regarding my family I saw
this question come in do I discuss this
because it's a very personal matter but
it's actually something that I am very
very open about I talked to a lot of
people about it I've written a book that
deals with the subject matter as well
but basically I was sexually abused as a
child and the abuse was from a family
member I was from an older stepbrother
so I was 11 years old and my sub brother
was I believe 17 at the time after I
came forward our our family dynamic
definitely changed thumb was married to
my little brother he's my half-brother
was married to his father and he had a
son from a previous marriage and not was
the one who was doing the abuse threat
came forward obviously that step brother
was taken away was not allowed back in
our home but the relationship between my
mom and my stepdad you know really fell
apart they got divorced shortly
afterwards and after that happened I
went with my mom and my little brother
stayed mostly with his dad and our
relationship just kind of became very
strained and I didn't get to see him a
lot and you know obviously it's it's the
most traumatic thing that has gone
through in my life um you know probably
for my mother as well she you know
didn't do well
dirt either because she took a lot of
blame for it and said you know she
should have known or she should have
sent something or she should she should
have seen a sign you know she felt a lot
of guilt and she went through a really
rough period herself and you know I
actually had kind of a strange
relationship with her too while she was
trying to work through it and like I
mentioned I I didn't really get to see
my little brother a lot and it was just
a really really hard time it's it's
something very difficult difficult to go
through it's difficult to talk about
even though like i mentioned i do talk
about it a lot i'm pretty open with it
and but even still you know it's still
hard to talk about because it's
traumatizing well i actually i'm very
happy to say though it you know that
happened when I was 11 and I really
didn't start to form a relationship
again with my little brother until I was
about 18 19 years old we worked hard at
it and we do really we do over like a
job of keeping in touch now even they
live in different towns we do a good job
of keeping in touch with each other
keeping each other in the loop visiting
each other I mentioned he walked me down
I love my wedding and that was a really
special day for us and I'm just really
really happy to have him in my life
because I love him so much and I'm
really really proud of my mom too
because I know that she battled a lot of
demons after this situation happened and
I'm really proud of who she is now and
she's such a great mom to me and I love
my family very dearly part of my life it
happened it doesn't define who I am you
know I'm a sexual abuse survivor but
that's not only who I am it's just a
small part of me and you know if I can
help people who are either going through
come forward or who went through it and
you know still just need someone to talk
to that's you know that's important to
me and it's a big reason why I'm so
vocal about my story part of my life
that is hard to talk about but I do it
because I know that it's important and I
came forward with my story in my friends
found out one of the friends and my
circle also came forward not too long
after that and said that her
uncle had actually been abusing her for
several years and she said that she
didn't think if I hadn't come forward
that she wasn't sure how much longer she
would have kept like she did not want to
come forward until she heard my story
and that really meant a lot to me and I
was 11 years old when this happened and
when she told me that and I just thought
I need to tell so many more people
because people either need to come
forward or they need to get help or
maybe they just need to talk about it
and that's important to me he's part of
my life it's the first time I'm saying
anything publicly in this platform I'm
very proud of a lot of my family members
for how we handled ourselves I'm very
proud of myself um very proud of myself
for standing up for myself what was that
the third question okay hopefully huh
hopefully there's the video won't be
like this well move on to some Instagram
questions so from blushed blonde she is
such a beauty she said your favorite go
to makeup look and what made you start a
makeup insta /youtube my favorite go to
makeup look is probably like pretty
similar to what I'm wearing today I just
do kind of like a deeper brown and the
crease and then I put some sort of like
shimmer shade on here today i have the
two-faced sweet peach palette on and i
think i have like puree and like lucious
or something on my lids and i love it
and a basic winged liner that's probably
my favorite and then what made me start
a makeup instagram on youtube I actually
did start YouTube a couple years ago I
started one in 2013 I've always just
been very interested in beauty and I
like to review products and I I always
wanted to learn how to do makeup I
really didn't know how to so i started
youtube in 2013 but I really wasn't sure
how to like market myself yet and I
didn't have a lot of confidence with it
and I didn't really have a lot of people
being like no you're doing good and I
thought that's what I needed at the time
and so I just kind of got embarrassed
and I stopped it and deleted the channel
and so I'm frustrated with myself at
that you know I I wish that I hadn't
have
it but I started again what last summer
because honestly it always kind of been
on my mind and I was always a little
frustrated with myself that I stopped
the author like I mentioned but I also
do run a blog and the blog was always
supposed to be for books and beauty and
lifestyle because I wanted to take
things that I have a big interest in and
be able to expand on them one of my
favorite things that I think that I get
to do in my life with being self
employed in my flexibility is finding
something that I love and doing it and
somehow making money off of it like
that's what makes me happy I love to
read I started a book blog and would get
paid for like advertising then as I got
more accustomed with it i would offer
like services to authors you know
editing and marketing and things like
that so that became a job and then I've
always wanted to write books and so I
did now that's a full-time career it's
kind of always my thing is how can I
take a hobby and turn it into a job
basically so that's kind of why I
started the YouTube and Instagram and
also just because these are really big
platforms for not only beauty but for
authors to and I just thought it would
be a way to connect with more people and
maybe a few guys like me on this type of
level hopefully that would cross over to
my otha my life as well because that
really is what pays my bills is selling
my book so you know maybe if I just get
myself out there more and meet a broader
audience it would be positive not only
in this aspect of my life but also my
career some mommy writes hey girl she
said what are your fun summer plans what
are some things in your writing marching
in career you are looking to expand
change grow new things etc really I
don't have a lot of summer plans this is
like one summer where we don't have 16
weddings to go to and 16
bachelor/bachelorette parties and
wedding showers really we don't have
anything else on the books what are some
things in your writing career that
you're looking to expand expand or
change or grow then I own a publishing
company I own the company marching ink
and so I do publish books for other
authors as well and honestly when it
comes to my company I really want to be
able to figure out how to be better at
like technical things like that's the
one thing that I really want to do
because I feel like like it's so
hard for me to do like reports and
accounting until all like very manual
manual and I feel like there's got to be
a software out there that will help me
to give these authors reports and i also
would really love to be able to create
something so the authors can go in every
single day and see how many books
they're selling or even every single
week and see how many books they're
selling I need to be better at like
technology things because I'm not like
that servant big downfall is and I wish
I could really help because I feel like
it would help take the publishing
company to a new level because a lot of
times I have to say no to publishing
books because I get so busy it's just me
doing this I do everything for the
company and it's hard because when i get
bogged down with things that you know
are super important obviously royalties
and payments and marketing and things
like that but then it doesn't leave me
enough time to pursue new books and be
able to publish new books and that's
really hard so i gotta i gotta try to
figure it out it's like my biggest
struggle and i hope to figure it out
soon yeah Amin says one thing you like
about makeup and opinions on justin
bieber hashtag belieber alert okay i
like it because it allows me to be
creative in a way that I never thought I
could be creative I'm not really like an
artsy type of person and a lot of people
who really interested and like good at
doing makeup they're also like artsy as
well and I'm not artsy in the absolute
slightest so I think it's a lot of fun
for me to be able to learn how to create
because i never thought i would have
that talent and my opinions on justin
bieber i don't know if i have a lot of
opinions on justin bieber I think he's
fine it's a little crazy for me but I
was never into the whole believer craze
because i think i was a little bit too
old for Justin and I was like is that
weird if I like him so I just kind of
never did anything i like i like his
songs and i like jam out to his songs
but his personal life is a little odd
right right Karen Rae right hey Karen
she says details on book five but love
my facebook to come out in the fall it
basically follows two different women we
have the girl who's always made the
right decisions in life she's always
been like the good girl and she starts
to go down a dangerous
path and then we also have the girl
who's always been the bad girl she's
always made the bad decision she comes
from the bad life and she is trying her
hardest to turn her life around into a
more positive life and somehow these
women connect and things happen from
there so I don't want to say too much
yet because like I said it is with my
beta readers so things still could
change so I don't know for sure but it
will definitely be a women's fiction
book and it definitely is going to be a
little bit on the darker more mature
side Alex x 0 says how did you get into
YouTube and why so I kind of did talk
about that a little bit but really
basically like when I have the idea of
hey I want to start a YouTube again it
came to me like on a Saturday that I was
like I i think i really really do want
to do this and that monday i took my
phone and I said it on a huge pile of
books and oh let me find it hold on oh
this is a piece of wood that my husband
made for me and then my dog proceeded to
chew up but i would take a chair and
then i would stack books on top of it
and then i would put this little piece
of wood on top and i would set my phone
like this to record me and that's what i
did that following monday and i was like
you know what I'm just going to record
some videos and see how it works out and
I very quickly got the bug and I record
videos every day or every other day and
I just I love doing it and I'm so glad
that I decided to do it and like i said
if you're interested in starting you
just gotta start and see if you fall in
love with them Carol Lago hey I
recognize so many these names it's so
much fun but she says is it tough to
maintain a successful channel a personal
life and work how do you balance
everything it is really hard and I've
kind of always struggled with the
balance because I have worked you know
I've worked for myself for so many years
i started in 2009 but I worked solely
from home since 2014 so for two years
now and it's hard because I do something
that I love I love my job I love what I
get to do and so it never really feels
like work for me like I get excited to
work I like it I love being at my
computer I love being on my laptop I
love that this is what I get to do but
then it's like oh I'm forgetting to like
like friends
like hey you want to go out for dinner
I'm like no I got work no you don't have
to work you can go out to dinner with
your friends like I struggle to take
breaks and that's why I mentioned
earlier it's so nice for me to have my
husband he might be like you've been
working for nine hours straight like you
need to take a break you need to eat
let's get out of the house a big thing
for me is actually physically leaving my
house because if I'm just sitting in
here in the house and like watching TV
I'm like why mine out of my laptop why
am I not reading when I might not on my
phone it's very very hard to find that
balance and especially after I left my
full-time job and went full time at home
that was a really really hard point and
my husband really had to sit me down and
be like we need to create boundaries for
you like I think you need to make a
schedule of I'm in the office from this
time to this time because i was working
around the clock because it's very i
think it's very scary to be
self-employed I don't have a steady
paycheck and you know if I'm not working
I'm typically not getting paid so I want
to work as much as I can because I don't
want to fail at what I'm doing because I
love what I'm doing and I don't want to
stop doing it good to have a balance
between working and then just keeping
yourself healthy because i was also
finding that I wasn't making like
healthy choices when I was like almost
addicted to working I wouldn't eat as
much or I constantly be eating at my
desk I would be missing my workouts
because I was like no I have to work
have to work that's not an okay thing to
do is tough but I'm really glad that I
worked it out and even though you know
sometimes I still can struggle with it
but it's a lot better now but it is hard
it is hard Oh polished in bubbly hello
Kayla says if you could collab with any
brand who would it be and what product
would you want to design um a little
that's hard because I don't think I've
ever considered that sweet I would say
like tart and I say that because tart is
the very first brand that like repost oh
and my photos they posted a lipstick
photo and it was like such a crazy day
so that was pretty cool so I don't maybe
tart I would I really like products and
what product would I want to design oh
no I see like everyone does like I
shadows
highlighters and lipsticks and things
like that like I don't know if I'd want
to design like maybe something like
different like I'm such an eyeliner
junkie like it maybe something was
eyeliners or things like that I don't
know I would have to i would have to
really think about that question because
that's a hard one because I've never
thought about that it's a beauty again
says is it bad that i'm asking multiple
questions but who are your favorite
youtubers i love the squad and then she
tagged as a perkins and luster looks i
do also very much appreciate jazzy
perkins in leicester lux i watch all
their videos jaclyn hill carli bybel was
actually be very first like big youtuber
that i started watching really really
love amanda ensing I I enjoy her videos
so much and Babs beauty is one who I
also really like lady nunnery hi Wendy
says here's one what is your all-time
favorite novel that is so hard I get
I've gotten that question before usually
how I answer it as I say one is
christy's great idea by am Martin it's
the very first book in the baby-sitters
club series and the baby-sitters club
series holds a very special place in my
heart cell full video on the
baby-sitters club and everything because
I do also do book videos on here every
once in a while too and I talked about
it because I had said you know sometimes
parts of my childhood weren't so great
and obviously now you guys know about
the abuse which was a big part of you
know me growing up and you know one
thing when the bad things were happening
I kind of turn two books to be my escape
and the baby-sitters club was definitely
one of them and those books are all
about like being the best person you can
be there are a lot of positivity in
those books and I feel like they really
really helped me through a lot of
difficult times the other one is
something borrowed by emily giffin I
actually borrowed it from a friend and
read it and it inspired me so much and I
was like you know what I've always
wanted to write a book and I've always
been putting it off I read something
borrowed and I just felt so inspired to
start something again and two weeks
later I had started my book blog and was
on my journey to becoming a published
out there so those two books have a lot
of significance in my life so I have to
give to them I'll for chea to says where
do you see yourself in five years
hopefully I'm still
doing what I love to do you know
hopefully this path is still the correct
path for me so hopefully still doing
what I love and hopefully still
publishing books and you know making
these videos hopefully traveling a lot
jumping over to the YouTube from
Jennifer petits she says how did you get
started on YouTube and were you nervous
so I kind of explained how i got on
youtube and was i nervous the first time
i started youtube yes I was extremely
nervous and I really didn't have a lot
of confidence yes I was still nervous
especially I think you can tell in my
first video and then I'm pretty nervous
and after that it kind of all goes away
because I feel very comfortable in front
of a camera I guess and I just enjoy
what I'm talking about and it makes me
excited so that kind of takes away the
nerves um you know of course it's always
a little nerve-racking to have like the
feedback coming in and like the negative
feedback is always not fun but as long
as I'm happy doing it then it kind of
makes up for it laughs flusher says how
was your childhood were you ever bullied
or do you have advice so I I did get
into a little bit about the childhood I
ever bullied no I was not thankfully so
do I have any advice the biggest piece
of advice is to find someone safe to be
able to talk to for me it was end of
mine as we were walking to school and I
said hey this is happening and she
brought me to the guidance counselor I
explained to the guidance counselor what
was happening and she called my mom and
stepdad and the police and as how we
started the situation someone of someone
safe that you can talk to to try to
figure out how to get past the situation
that you're dealing with no matter what
it is that you're dealing with you
cannot keep it inside you just you
cannot keep it inside you have to be
able to talk to someone about it well
before the abuse happened I had a great
childhood and I get very angry sometimes
that that was taken away from me you
know we lived in a really nice
neighborhood and there was a lot of kids
around we were close to the pool we were
close to the ice cream shop and
everything was very idealistic and then
it was kind of ripped away from me or
some mature a lot quicker that I should
have and that's something that will
always make me um a little frustrated
and upset
it's but at the same time it's fine it
happened it I went through it I survived
and you know my life is great now it's
like two different parts of a childhood
before and after and yeah before was
fantastic the after was really hard but
at least I wasn't bullied that's good
breath Garza says my question to you is
what is your favorite type of music i am
a rap superstar I know I maybe don't
look like one but I definitely am I have
a lot of rap skills so I'm definitely
into like rap hip-hop I do like pop I
crack as well bullet for my valentine
asking alexandria I enjoy going to those
concerts I think the only like type of
music I don't enjoy this country I've
just never really been able to get into
it pianist but everything else I really
like Sofia Davis says what is your
favorite makeup item like your one Holy
Grail item honestly it's probably
eyeliner like I can't stand not wearing
eyeliner because it just makes my eyes
like look like I don't even have any
eyes and it just makes me look so young
like I always have to have eyeliner on
beauty 24 says how long have you been
doing makeup basically since I got on
youtube I never really could figure out
makeup for the longest time and I would
love it like I would love to buy makeup
and go to the makeup stores and go to
the beauty aisles and buy makeup in the
neck at home would be like I don't know
what I'm doing so I really credit
youtube for helping me understand how to
do makeup and sometimes I'll do a makeup
look and just sit back and be like two
years ago I didn't even know how to put
eyeshadow on like how is this happening
so Nikki Allen says my question for the
QA is if you could choose between Zac
Efron or training team to take you on a
date which would you choose and why I
would choose Channing Tatum because
hashtag Magic Mike ok so I'm going to
finish up here and try to get through
these last ones as much as I can but I
feel like this video's already really
long so Casey Lynn says how did you get
your channel to grow so well I have been
scared to actually get started with mine
I I mean I honestly I don't even think
my channel grows it well like sometimes
I get frustrated when I put out so many
videos and I really try to pay attention
to the content that I'm putting out and
then like if nothing happens I'm like
dang it why does that not work either so
it's hard but I also always have to
remind myself
it's definitely not just a numbers game
and if you get sucked into that then I
think it would probably take the joy out
of what you're doing and make you not
want to do it anymore so it's really
just needs to be about keeping happy
with what it is that i am doing but i
think a good way is just to be as
interactive as you can and to take
advantage of all the social medias out
there just trying to be as interactive
with people as you can this is about
making friends to me and it's about
being able to be yourself and I think
those those things are really important
one d queen says which is your favorite
outfit brand i love forever 21 i don't
know if i have a favorite brand in
general but my sister-in-law owns a
clothing boutique called top off
clothing i talk about it so often on my
channel it was featured heavily in my
lookbook and that's basically where i
buy most of my clothes from you know not
only of course is it like yeah I'm
supporting family but she just has like
the cutest things and for reasonable
prices so let's just always where I shop
it's really nice i'll link it below

another country or continent i have

Lucia and i just i love it as travel
major in college I would love to travel

Lily Madrigal says was it hard starting
out your YouTube channel it was hard
because I didn't have a camera I didn't
have any sort of like set up also did
not know how to edit for the longest
time I was simply using the YouTube
video editor which doesn't have a lot of
different functions but it was at least
letting me like split and trim the
videos like first few videos had
absolutely no ending it at all because I
didn't know how to do it and like I
mentioned I'm not super great with
technology and editing still can kind of
freaked me out but now I do have some
editing software and I think that it
really helps the quality of my videos
but yeah it was it was hard but because
I knew it was something that I wanted to
do you just did your best with what you
could and you just keep progressing Oh
Maude Peterson 22 asks where were you
born I was actually born in Vice
California so Lisa crew says what is
your tip for late bloomers like myself
on makeup does the age you start wearing
makeup matter no way because I know like
especially when I got to college to like
the last couple years of high school and
then being in college and girls would
show up just with like crazy beautiful
makeup on and I would be like and they
came from inhaling at me please hey
don't know anyway like I would feel like
kind of embarrassed about it but
whatever it is what it is but yeah it
wasn't until I was about 26 that I
really started getting into makeup and
learning different techniques and just
learning how to buy how to understand my
skin type how to understand that tones
like it ya know I was a late bloomer too
so it's definitely never too late it's
never too late to do anything that you
really want to do never Lisa Yasmine
says what are your favorite types of
books I really like Chiclets women's
fiction romance I like like
light-hearted mysteries those are
probably and my favorites to read a
subtle beauty 27 says how do you create
tutorials for Instagram I create my
Instagram tutorials on the same editing
software that i do my youtube videos
which is wondershare film hora v
readings says what is your secret to
great skin taking off your makeup at
night take off your makeup and I do not
slip in your makeup Alexandra Hughes
says you seem like such a strong and
happy person so how do you deal with
internet trolls / haters and negative
comments um you know I just try not to
put a lot of energy into them or focus
on them like they do come in and the
nasty comments do come in and the
dislikes come in which is super
disheartening I wish we did not have a
dislike button on YouTube it doesn't
make any sense to me I don't think it
needs to be there but it's just putting
your time and your energy and your focus
into the positive comments and the
positivity rather than focusing on the
negative just you can't you just you
just gotta let it wash off you can't
focus on it Aisha poco de says what is
your weirdest habit I actually was
thinking about this other day I did not
know this question was in here but I
thought about it as I was doing it so
when I take a shower when I get out I
have to put on like the biggest like
loose fitting pair of sweatpants of life
like something about getting out of the
shower and I'm like putting lotion on
and then put
like a pair of leggings on or any sort
of like tight anything it just like oh I
don't like it at all I have to like when
I get a shower I have to put my big
stuff pants on and I even have a pair of
pants that it lay out ever since the
time as we get out of the shower they're
so old there's no drawstring to him
anymore so they're huge my dog like
ripped a hole in it but I don't care
those are the pants that I put on after
the shower I can't like even shorts like
in the summertime putting shorts on I
don't like doing that either because
then I feel like I'm cold and if you
just shave your legs and it's not good
so putting sweatpants on after the
shower I have to do it have to do it and
then the last question is that I'm going
to do is from Samantha Wilson who says
since you're an author who would you say
is your biggest literary influence a lot
of times it's honestly a lot of the
indie authors that I meet in come in
contact with they inspire me so much but
for like traditional authors emily

her work and I love her social-media
presence alright guys that was going to
