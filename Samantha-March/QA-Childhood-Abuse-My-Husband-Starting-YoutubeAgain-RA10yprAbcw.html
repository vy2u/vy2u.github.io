today's video is going to be a Q&amp;amp;A video
this video has been in the works for a
very long time and I kind of kept
putting it off because I was like I
don't know do people really want to see
like me answering questions like who
really cares right and so as I would get
like new products to review or new
makeup tutorials or things like that I
was like let's put those before the Q&amp;amp;A
let's put those before the Q&amp;amp;A and I was
like I really really need to get this
filmed because it has been requested but
also because questions have come in like
back a few weeks ago when I thought I
was going to film it I asked for
questions on like Instagram and YouTube
and I got so many questions in and I was
like I can't just keep doing those
questions like you have to get over it
you have to stop being so intimidated by
a Q&amp;amp;A and you just need to do it so that
is what today's video is gonna be I do
actually have a few questions from
snapchat that I'll probably go through
first and then I'll move on to Instagram
and then I'll head over to YouTube to
answer some questions that were left on
a video and hopefully I will get through
as many questions as I can if you did
ask me a question thank you so much I
really appreciate it q and A's are
honestly some of my favorite videos to
watch because I feel like we're getting
to know the people that were watching on
camera a lot better and you realize
certain things about them you guys will
find this interesting as well but I just
wanted to hop into it because I know we
have a lot of questions to get through
so I hope you enjoy my Q&amp;amp;A and that came
in is from Danielle he says how does
your husband feel about your YouTube
channel and as he watched them and would
you /he consider doing the my husband
does my makeup challenge
yes he's subscribed to me helps me fill
my videos like my lookbook he filled
that entire thing for me and he's really
supportive in that way I am very much
someone who is always trying to think of
something else to do
I am self-employed I work from home and
I always have a different idea to do
that I want to try and YouTube was an
example of that and I think he's kind of
used to it like he's used to me always
like maybe we should try this maybe we
should try that maybe we should do that
and he's always very supportive of it I
don't know
we always understands the way that my
brain works and sometimes is like what
girls like do you ever rest or do you
ever just like take a breath and it's
actually kind of a good thing because if
I didn't have him there to be like hey I
think I you need to take a break hey you
need to eat dinner like if I didn't have
him there to kind of like balance me out
I would probably be burned-out very very
fast so he kind of like can keep me
focus and keep me away from work when I
need to be away from work so I'm very
much appreciative to him for that and
would we ever do the my husband does my
makeup challenge it was really funny
because he was actually next to me as
that question came in and so I read it
off to him and he was like you want me
to do your makeup on camera let me let
me show you how I'll do your makeup on
camera and he's a big fan of The
Simpsons and he pulls up a Simpsons
video on YouTube of like Bart no Homer
Homer I clearly don't watch The Simpsons
of the main guy and he made a gun for
women to do makeup with and you shoot
the gun and it puts paint makeup on
their face and that was what he wants to
do so um no is my answer right now but
maybe that will change but yep that's
what he showed me and so that's how he
would plan to do my makeup if he could
make one of those makeup guns so there's
that hey you did not screenshot a name
on this one oh I'm so sorry about that
first time doing this but what advice do
you have to anyone who wants to become a
beauty influencer on YouTube probably my
biggest piece of advice would be to just
do it and to just start it I don't say
that's my biggest piece of advice for
anything that you want to do I am an
author and the the main question that I
get is you know that same question I
want to be an author I want to write a
book what what is your advice is to just
do it just sit down and start to write
it same thing with beauty and YouTube if
that's what you want to do you just need
to start it once you get started you'll
be able to quickly realize if it is
something that you want to do or not and
like I said like I have a lot of ideas
and I like to try a lot of different
things and there's been a lot of things
that I've started and tried out and been
like ooh you know what
I actually don't really like doing that
or I don't find a lot of joy in that and
I'll
doing them but at least I tried so just
trying and starting out is probably just
the biggest thing and you'll quickly
realize if it's a good fit for you and
if it is and if it's something that you
love doing then you won't want to stop
doing it so that would be my advice this
is from Kelly or que Bella Beauty she
says you've mentioned that you had a bit
of a strained relationship with your
family do you have a better relationship
with them now so um did a snap a while
back and I was talking about my
relationship with my younger brother and
just about how we used to not really
have a relationship and now we do and
how great it is and you know he gave me
away at my wedding and all this stuff so
um yeah so I've had a strained
relationship regarding my family I saw
this question come in do I discuss this
because it's a very personal matter but
it's actually something that I am very
very open about I talked to a lot of
people about it I've written a book that
deals with the subject matter as well
but basically I was sexually abused as a
child and the abuse was from a family
member it was from an older stepbrother
so I was 11 years old and my stepfather
was I believe 17 at the time after I
came forward our our family dynamic
definitely changed um was married to my
little brothers he's my half-brother was
married to his father and he had a son
from a previous marriage and that was
the one who was doing the abuse it came
forward obviously that stepbrother was
taken away was not allowed back in our
home but the relationship between my mom
and my stepdad you know really fell
apart they got divorced shortly
afterwards and after that happened I
went with my mom and my little brother
stayed mostly with his dad and our
relationship just kind of became very
strained and I didn't get to see him a
lot and you know obviously it's it's the
most traumatic thing that I've gone
through in my life
you know probably for my mother as well
she you know didn't do well after it
either because she took a lot of blame
for it and inside you know she should
have known or she should have sensed
something or she should she should have
seen a sign you know she felt a lot of
guilt and she went through a really
rough period herself and you know I
actually had kind of a strange
relationship with her too while she was
trying to work through it and like I
mentioned I I didn't really get to see
my little brother a lot and it was just
a really really hard time it's it's
something very difficult difficult to go
through it's difficult to talk about
even though like I mentioned I do talk
about it a lot I'm pretty open with it
and but even still you know it's still
hard to talk about because it's
traumatizing well I I have to say I'm
very happy to say though it you know
that happened when I was 11 and I really
didn't start to form a relationship
again with my little brother until I was
about 18 19 years old
we worked hard at it and we do really we
do a really good job of keeping in touch
now even they live in different towns we
do a good job of keeping in touch with
each other keeping each other in the
loop visiting each other - mentioned he
walked me down the aisle of my wedding
and that was a really special day for us
and I'm just really really happy to have
him in my life because I love him so
much and I'm really really proud of my
mom too because I know that she battled
a lot of demons after this situation
happened and I'm really proud of who she
is now and she's such a great mom to me
and I love my family very dearly a part
of my life had happened it doesn't
define who I am
you know I'm a sexual abuse survivor but
that's not only Who I am it's just a
small part of me and you know if I can
help people who are either going through
it come forward or who went through it
and you know still just need someone to
talk to that's you know that's important
to me and it's a big reason why I'm so
vocal about my story part of my life
that is hard to talk about but I do it
because I know that it's important and I
came forward with my story and my
friends found out one of the
and my circle also came forward not too
long after that and said that her uncle
had actually been abusing her for
several years and she said that she
didn't think if I hadn't come forward
that she wasn't sure how much longer she
would have kept like she did not want to
come forward until she heard my story
and that really meant a lot to me and I
was 11 years old when this happened and
when she told me that and I just thought
I need to tell so many more people
because people either need to come
forward or they need to get help or
maybe they just need to talk about it
and that's important to me
you started my life it's the first time
I'm saying anything publicly in this
platform I'm very proud of a lot of my
family members for how we handled
ourselves I'm very proud of myself very
proud of myself for standing up for
myself Oh was that the third question
okay hopefully huh hopefully there's the
video won't be like this well move on to
some Instagram questions
so from blushed blonde she is such a
beauty she said your favorite go to
makeup look and what made you start a
makeup insta slash YouTube my favorite
go to makeup look is probably like
pretty similar to what I'm wearing today
I just do kind of like a deeper brown
and the crease and then I put some sort
of like shimmer shade on here today I
have the Too Faced sweet peach palette
on and I think I have like puree and
like luscious or something on my lids
and I love it and a basic winged liner
that's probably my favorite and then
what made me start a makeup Instagram in
YouTube I actually did start YouTube a
couple years ago I started one in 2013
I've always just been very interested in
beauty and I like to review products and
I always wanted to learn how to do
makeup I really didn't know how to so I
started a YouTube in 2013 but I really
wasn't sure how to like market myself
yet and I didn't have a lot of
confidence with it and I didn't really
have a lot of people being like no
you're doing good and I thought that's
what I needed at the time and so I just
kind of got embarrassed and I stopped it
and deleted the channel and so I'm
frustrated with myself
you know I I wish that I hadn't have
done it but I started again what last
summer because honestly I'd always kind
of been on my mind and I was always a
little pressured it with myself that I
stopped but after like I mentioned but I
also do run a blog and the blog was
always supposed to be for books and
beauty and lifestyle because I wanted to
take things that I have a big interest
in and be able to expand on them one of
my favorite things that I think that I
can do in my life with being
self-employed in my flexibility is
finding something that I love and doing
it and somehow making money off of it
like that's what makes me happy I love
to read I started a book blog and would
get paid for like advertising and then
as I got more accustomed with it
I would offer like services to authors
you know editing and marketing and
things like that so that became a job
and then I've always wanted to write
books and so I did now that's a
full-time career it's kind of always my
thing is how can I take a hobby and turn
it into a job basically so that's kind
of why I started the YouTube and
Instagram and also just because these
are really big platforms for not only
beauty but for authors too and I just
thought it would be a way to connect
with more people and maybe a few guys
like me on this type of level hopefully
that would cross over into my often life
as well because that really is what pays
my bills is selling my book so you know
maybe if I just get myself out there
more and meet a broader audience it
would be positive not only in this
aspect of my life but also my career
some ami writes hi girl she said what
are your fun summer plans what are some
things in your writing marching in
career you are looking to expand change
grow new things etc really I don't have
a lot of summer plans this is like one
summer where we don't have 16 weddings
to go to and 16 bachelor bachelorette
parties and wedding showers really we
don't have anything else on the books
what are some things in your writing
career that you're looking to expand
expand or change or grow then I own a
publishing company I own the company
marching Inc and so I do publish books
for other authors as well and honestly
when it comes to my company I really
want to be able to figure out how to be
better at like technical things like
that's the
think that I really wanted to do because
I feel like like it's so hard for me to
do like reports and accounting I don't
all like very manual manual and I feel
like there's got to be a software out
there that will help me to give these
authors reports and I also would really
love to be able to create something so
the author's can go in every single day
and see how many books they're selling
or even every single week and see how
many books they're selling I need to be
better at like technology things because
I'm not like a servant big downfall is
and I wish I could really help because I
feel like it would help take the
publishing company to a new level
because a lot of times I have to say no
to publishing books because I get so
busy it's just me doing this I do
everything for the company and it's hard
because when I get bogged down with
things that you know are super important
obviously royalties and payments and
marketing and things like that but then
it doesn't leave me enough time to
pursue new books and be able to publish
new books and that's really hard so I
gotta I gotta try to figure it out it's
like my biggest struggle and I hope to
figure it out soon yeah Amin says one
thing you like about makeup and opinions
on justin bieber hashtag belieber alert
okay i like it because it allows me to
be creative in a way that I never
thought I could be creative I'm not
really like an artsy type of person and
a lot of people who really interested
and like good at doing makeup they're
also like artsy as well and I'm not
artsy in the absolute slightest so I
think it's a lot of fun for me to be
able to learn how to create because I
never thought I would have that talent
and my opinions on Justin Bieber I don't
know if I have a lot of opinions on
Justin Bieber I think he's fine it's a
little crazy for me but I was never into
the whole belieber craze because I think
I was a little bit too old for Justin
and I was like is that weird if I like
him so I just kind of never did anything
I like I like his songs and I like jam
out to his songs but his personal life
is a little odd right right McCarron ray
writes hey Karen
she says details on a book five would
love my fifth book to come out in the
fall it basically follows two different
women we have the girl who's always made
the right decision
like she's always been like the good
girl and she starts to go down a
dangerous path and then we also have the
girl who's always been the bad girl
she's always made the bad decision she
comes from the bad life and she's trying
her hardest to turn her life around into
a more positive life and somehow these
women connect and things happen from
there so I don't want to say too much
yet because like I said it is with my
beta readers something still could
change so I don't know for sure but it
will definitely be a women's fiction
book and it definitely is gonna be a
little bit on the darker more mature
side Alex x-o says how did you get into
YouTube and why so I kind of did talk
about that a little bit but really
basically like when I have the idea of
hey I want to start a YouTube again it
came to me like on a Saturday that I was
like I I think I really really do want
to do this and that Monday I took my
phone and I set it on a huge pile of
books and oh let me find it hold on oh
this is a piece of wood that my husband
made for me and then my dog proceeded to
chew up but I would take a chair and
then I would stack books on top of it
and then I would put this little piece
of wood on top and I would set my phone
like this to record me and that's what I
did that following Monday and I was like
you know what I'm just gonna record some
videos and see how it works out and I
very quickly got the bug and I record
videos every day or every other day and
I just I love doing it and I'm so glad
that I decided to do it and like I
thought if you're interested in starting
you just gotta start and see if you fall
in love with it Carol Lago hey I
recognize so many these names it's so
much fun but she says is it tough to
maintain a successful channel a personal
life and work how do you balance
everything it is really hard and I've
kind of always struggled with the
balance because I have worked you know
I've worked for myself for so many years
I started in 2009 but I worked solely
from home since 2014 so for two years
now and it's hard because I do something
that I love I love my job I love what I
get to do and so it never really feels
like work for me like I get excited to
work I like it I love being at my
computer I love being on my laptop I
that this is what I get to do but then
it's like oh I'm forgetting to like like
friends I'll be like hey you want to go
out for dinner I'm like no I gotta work
no you don't have to work you can go out
to dinner with your friends like I
struggle to take breaks and that's why I
mentioned earlier it's so nice for me to
have my husband here would be like
you've been working for nine hours
straight like you need to take a break
you need to eat let's get out of the
house a big thing for me is actually
physically leaving my house because if
I'm just sitting in here in the house
and like watching TV I'm like why am I
not in my laptop why am I not reading
when I am I not on my phone it's very
very hard to find that balance and
especially after I left my full-time job
and went full-time at home that was a
really really hard point and my husband
really had to sit me down and be like we
need to create boundaries for you like I
think you need to make a schedule of I'm
in the office from this time to this
time because I was working around the
clock because it's very I think it's
very scary to be self-employed I don't
have a steady paycheck and you know if
I'm not working I'm typically not
getting paid so I want to work as much
as I can because I don't want to fail at
what I'm doing because I love what I'm
doing and I don't want to stop doing it
it's good to have a balance between
working and then just keeping yourself
healthy because I was also finding that
I wasn't making like healthy choices
when I was like almost addicted to
working I wouldn't eat as much or I
constantly be eating at my desk I would
be missing my workouts because I was
like no I have to work I have to work
that's not an okay thing to do it's
tough but I'm really glad that I worked
it out and even though you know
sometimes I still can struggle with it
but it's it's a lot better now but it is
hard it is hard oh polished and bubbly
hello Kayla says if you could collab
with any brand who would it be and what
product would you want to design um a
little that's hard because I don't think
I've ever considered that sweet I would
say like tart and I say that because
tart is the very first brand that like
reposted one of my photos they posted a
lipstick photo and it was like such a
crazy day so that was pretty cool so I
don't maybe tart I really like products
and what product would I want to design
oh I see like everyone does like
eyeshadows and highlighters and
lipsticks and things like that like I
don't know if I'd want to design like
maybe something like different like I'm
such an eyeliner junkie like it maybe
something with eyeliners or things like
that I don't know I would have to I
would have to really think about that
question because that's a hard one
because I've never thought about that
beauty again says is it bad that I'm
asking multiple questions but who are
your favorite youtubers I love the squad
and then she tagged Essie Perkins and
Lester lux
I do also very much appreciate desi
Perkins and Lester Lux I watch all their
videos
Jacqueline Hill Carli bybel was actually
the very first like big youtuber that I
started watching really really loved I
mean dancing I I enjoy her videos so
much and Babs Beauty is one who I also
really like lady nunnery hi Wendy
says here's one what is your all-time
favorite novel that is so hard I get
I've gotten that question before
actually how I answer it as I say one is
Christie's great idea by A&amp;amp;M Martin it's
the very first book in the baby-sitters
club series and the baby-sitters club
series holds a very special place in my
heart so full video on the baby-sitters
club and everything because I do also do
book videos on here every once in a
while too and I talk about it because I
had said you know sometimes parts of my
childhood have weren't so great and
obviously now you guys know about the
abuse which was a big part of you know
me growing up and you know one thing
when the bad things were happening I
kind of turned to books to be my escape
and the baby-sitters club was definitely
one of them and those books are all
about like being the best person you can
be there are a lot of positivity in
those books and I feel like they really
really helped me through a lot of
difficult times another one is something
borrowed by Emily Giffen I actually
borrowed it from a friend and read it
and it inspired me so much and I was
like you know what I've always wanted to
write a book and I've always been
putting it off I read something borrowed
and I just felt so inspired to start
something again and two weeks later I
had started my book blog and was on my
journey to becoming a published author
so those two books have a lot of
significance in my life so I have to
give to them I'll for chit to
says where do you see yourself in five
years hopefully I'm still doing what I
love to do you hope like this path is
still the correct path for me so
hopefully still doing what I love and
hopefully still publishing books and you
know making these videos hopefully
traveling a lot jumping over to the
youtubes from Jennifer petit she says
how did you get started on YouTube and
were you nervous so I kind of explained
how I got on YouTube and was i nervous
the first time I started YouTube yes I
was extremely nervous and I really
didn't have a lot of confidence yes I
was still nervous especially I think you
can tell in my first video and then I'm
pretty nervous and after that it kind of
all goes away because I feel very
comfortable in front of a camera I guess
and i just enjoy what i'm talking about
and it makes me excited so that kind of
takes away the nerves you know of course
it's always a little nerve-racking to
have like the feedback coming in and
like the negative feedback is always not
fun but as long as I'm happy doing it
then it kind of makes up for it but
flusher says how was your childhood were
you ever bullied or do you have advice
so I I did get into a little bit about
the childhood I ever bullied no I was
not thankfully so do I have any advice
the biggest piece of advice is to find
someone safe to be able to talk to for
me it was end of mine as we were walking
to school and I said hey this is
happening and she brought me to the
guidance counselor I explained to the
guidance counselor what was happening
and she called my mom and stepdad and
the police and that's how we started the
situation someone of someone's safe that
you can talk to to try to figure out how
to get past the situation that you're
dealing with no matter what it is that
you're dealing with you cannot keep it
inside you just you cannot keep it
inside you have to be able to talk to
someone about it well before the abuse
happened I had a great childhood and I
get very angry sometimes that that was
taken away from me you know we lived in
a really nice neighborhood and there was
a lot of kids around we were close to
the pool we were close to the ice cream
shop and everything was very idealistic
and then it was kind of ripped away from
me forced to mature a lot quicker that I
should
have and that's something that will
always make me a little frustrated and
upset but at the same time it's fine it
happened it I went through it I survived
and you know my life is great now it's
like two different parts of a childhood
before and after and yeah before was
fantastic the after was really hard but
at least I wasn't bullied that's good
Brooke Garza says my question to you is
what is your favorite type of music I am
a rap superstar I know I may be don't
look like one but I definitely am I have
a lot of rap skills so I'm definitely
into like rap hip-hop I do like pop like
rock as well Bullet For My Valentine
asking alexandria I enjoy going to those
concerts
I think the only like type of music I
don't enjoy is country I've just never
really been able to get into it be
honest but everything else I really like
Sophia Davis says what is your favorite
makeup item like your one Holy Grail
item honestly it's probably eyeliner
like I can't stand not wearing eyeliner
because it just makes my eyes like look
like I don't even have any eyes and it
just makes me look so young like I
always have to have eyeliner on Beauty
24 says how long have you been doing
makeup basically since I got on YouTube
I never really could figure out makeup
for the longest time and I would love it
like I would love to find makeup and go
to the makeup stores and go to the
beauty aisles and buy makeup and then
then get home and be like I don't know
what I'm doing so I really credit
YouTube for helping me understand how to
do makeup and sometimes I'll do a makeup
look and just sit back and be like two
years ago I didn't even know how to put
eyeshadow on like how is this happening
so Nicky Allen says my question for the
QA is if you could choose between Zek
Efron or Channing Tam to take you on a
date which would you choose and why I
would choose Channing Tatum because
hashtag Magic Mike okay so I'm gonna
finish up here and try to get through a
few those last ones as much as I can but
I feel like this videos already really
long so Casey Lin says how did you get
your channel to grow so well I have been
scared to actually get started with mine
I I mean I honestly I don't even think
my channel grows that well like
sometimes I get frustrated when I put
out so many videos and I really try to
pay attention to the Khan
that I'm putting out and then like if
nothing happens I'm like dang it why
does that not work either so it's hard
but I also always have to remind myself
that it's definitely not just a numbers
game and if you get sucked into that
then I think it would probably take the
joy out of what you're doing and make
you not want to do it anymore so it
really just needs to be about keeping
happy with what it is that I am doing
but I think a good way is just to be as
interactive as you can and to take
advantage of all the social medias out
there I'm just trying to be as
interactive with people as you can this
is about making friends to me and it's
about being able to be yourself and I
think those those things are really
important one D queen says which is your
favorite outfit brand I loved forever 21
I don't know if I have a favorite brand
in general but my sister-in-law owns a
clothing boutique called top loft
clothing I talk about it so often on my
channel it was featured heavily in my
lookbook and that's basically where I
buy most of my clothes from you know not
only of course is it like yeah I'm
supporting family but she just has like
the cutest things and for reasonable
prices so that's just always where I
shop it's really nice I'll link it below
for tema says have you ever traveled to
another country or continent I have
traveled to Amsterdam and I have also
been to Jamaica the Bahamas and st.
Lucia and I just I love it I was
traveling during college I would love to
travel anywhere and everywhere I love it
so Lilly Madrigal says was it hard
starting out your YouTube channel it was
hard because I didn't have a camera I
didn't have any sort of like setup I
also did not know how to edit for the
longest time I was simply using the
YouTube video editor which doesn't have
a lot of different functions but is at
least letting me like split and trim the
videos like first few videos had
absolutely no ending it at all because I
didn't know how to do it and like I
mentioned I'm not super great with
technology and editing still can kind of
freak me out but now I do have some
editing software and I think that it
really helps the quality of my videos
but yeah it was it was hard but because
I knew it was something that I wanted to
do you just did your best with what you
could and you just keep progressing Oh
Maude Peterson 22
where were you born I was actually born
in Visalia California ELISA Cruz says
what is your tip for late bloomers like
myself on makeup does the age you start
wearing makeup matter no way because I
know like especially when I got to
college to like the last couple years of
high school and then being in college
and girls would show up just with like
crazy beautiful makeup on and I would be
like like I would feel like kind of
embarrassed about it but whatever it is
what it is but yeah it wasn't until I
was about 26 that I really started
getting into makeup and learning
different techniques and just learning
how to buy how to understand my skin
type how to understand the tones like
it's ya know I was a late bloomer to a
sudden it's definitely never too late
it's never too late to do anything that
you really want to do never
Lisa Yasmine says what are your favorite
types of books I really like chiclet
women's fiction romance I like like
light hearted mysteries those are
probably and my favorites to read a
subtle beauty 27 says how do you create
tutorials or Instagram I create my
Instagram tutorials on the same editing
software that I do my YouTube videos
which is wondershare filmora
me readings says what is your secret to
great skin taking off your makeup at
night take off your makeup at night do
not slip in your makeup Alexandre Hughes
says you seem like such a strong and
happy person so how do you deal with
internet trolls / haters and negative
comments you know I just try not to put
a lot of energy into them or focus on
them like they do come in and the nasty
comments do come in and the dislikes
come in which is super disheartening I
wish we did not have a dislike button on
YouTube it doesn't make any sense to me
I don't think it needs to be there but
it's just putting your time and your
energy and your focus into the positive
comments and the positivity rather than
focusing on the negative just you can't
you just you just gotta let it wash off
you can't focus on it
Ayesha okoda says what is your weirdest
habit I actually was thinking about this
other day I did not know this question
was in here but I thought about it as I
was doing it so when I take a shower
when I get out I have to put on like the
biggest like loose-fitting pair of
sweatpants of life like some
think about getting out of the shower
and then like putting lotion on and then
putting like a pair of leggings on or
any sort of like tight anything it just
like oh I don't like it at all I have to
like when I get out a shower I have to
put my big stuff pants on and I even
have a pair of sweatpants that it lay
out every single time as we get out of
the shower they're so old
there's no drawstring to him anymore so
they're huge my dog like ripped a hole
in it but I don't care those are the
pants that I put on after the shower I
can't like even shorts like in the
summertime putting shorts on I don't
like doing that either because then I
feel like I'm cold and if you just shave
your legs and it's not good so putting
sweat pants on after the shower I have
to do it have to do it and then the last
question is that I'm gonna do is from
samantha wilson who says since you're an
author who would you say is your biggest
literary influence a lot of times it's
honestly a lot of the indie authors that
i meet and come in contact with they
inspire me so much but for like
traditional authors emily Giffen is a
huge one i absolutely love her work and
I love her social media presence alright
