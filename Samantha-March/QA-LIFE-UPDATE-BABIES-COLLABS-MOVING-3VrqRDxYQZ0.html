today's video is going to be a Q&amp;amp;A I
have not done a Q&amp;amp;A on my channel in a
very long time I really don't know when
the last time I did one I think it's
been quite some time I'm actually pre
filming as some videos because I will be
on vacation in Arizona for a few days
over my birthday and so I was trying to
think of a few videos that maybe
wouldn't be like super challenging to
film and edit to kind of thing and I
thought maybe it would be a perfect time
to do a Q&amp;amp;A so that is what I'm doing
today I asked on Twitter and snapchat
and Instagram stories and I got some
questions and so I'm gonna try not to
make this too long
mostly just because I'm actually leaving
for Arizona the day after I'm filming
this and so I'm trying to get all my
videos edited and uploaded so all I have
to do on vacation is just hit publish
and then I can keep enjoying myself so
I'm gonna try not to make this too long
so I do apologize if I skip over any
questions but I will do my best to
respond it to everybody's butt when I go
ahead and jump into this Q&amp;amp;A alrighty so
from Twitter we have Excel Ashley Amanda
X said what was the first brand to send
you PR the first brand it to send me PR
I didn't know I didn't look at the
questions beforehand I was just
screenshotting all of them and saving
them in a folder I I think it was Sigma
Beauty or at least they were like the
first bigger brand to send me PR but I
want to say that it was Sigma cuz I mean
I can really remember like getting so
excited over getting that package I
still have the package the original
package that they sent me because Sigma
was one of the first like high-end the
first high-end brand that I was
purchasing makeup brushes from I love my
makeup brushes before I was buying from
Sigma by like the $1 and $2 elf brushes
and I purchased them from BH Cosmetics
with those those Sigma brushes were the
first time I was like kind of splurging
on makeup brushes so I just kind of
always remember for them to be the first
big brand to notice me and to send me a
package it just felt it just felt really
really cool and then we have here from
Emily
two different questions she says any
tips for smaller creators some of my
biggest tips for smaller creators some
would be to try to be consistent with
posting weather you know however many
days you decide you want to post a week
but trying to be consistent with it
instead of posting like one video here
and then like three weeks later posting
another video I think people like to see
consistency on YouTube I would also
always recommend not to get too caught
up in the numbers sometimes it's just
it's so I don't know I just get so sad
for some creators who contact me and are
only ever talking to me about the
numbers and reviews or subscribers or
something because I feel like that takes
the fun out of having a youtube channel
and like no one's forcing anybody to
have a youtube channel you're supposed
to be doing this for fun for you and so
I think sometimes when you get a little
bit too caught up in the numbers it
takes that fun away so don't pay
attention to that stuff at first it's
always good to grow and it's good to see
growth but if you get too consumed by it
I think it really does take the fun out
of having a channel the tip of mine
would be like before you start really
investing in like equipment camera
lighting editing
things like that starting to work on
having a big old makeup collection that
sort of thing is to make sure that this
is something that you really want to do
make sure you get comfortable on camera
make sure you like the process like sure
it's something for you and that you
really like to do before you start
putting a bunch of money into it so I
think I had my channel for a year before
I purchased a camera and then before
that it was just off my phone so that's
what those are a few tips that I would
give and then her other question is if
you could only buy one new thing from
Sephora what would it be right now in my
cart a Sephora is that Marc Jacobs
bronzer that I have wanted so bad I
talked about it in a will i buy it video
like a couple of weeks ago and I was
like I'm getting that bronzer and I am
I'm getting it don't talk me out of it I
I almost placed my order the other night
but I was like I know it's gonna come
while we're gone
and I just hate the thought of having
packages sitting outside my door
especially one that says Sephora and I'm
gone for five days or six days so I'm
like oh wait I'll get back to order it
so next up from Haley on Twitter she
says what is your favorite book genre I
you and your videos so much thank you my
favorite book genre definitely chiclet
is like my favorite my book blog that I
have is called a chiclet plus I love a
chiclet I love just being able to escape
into a different world
chicklet is kind of I describe it as
like women's fiction but it has a more
humorous light-hearted tone to it the
complete flip side of that I also really
enjoy like thrillers and suspense novels
like two very different ends of the
spectrum but those are two of my
favorite genres to read from a Paris
grace on Twitter she said perfect time
I've been wanting to ask you a question
what do you recommend as a facial
cleanser to fully wash away makeup my
favorite cleanser to remove makeup is
the Dermalogica pre cleanse it's a
pricier cleanser but I have repurchased
it myself and I just think it's the best
at getting rid of all of my makeup my
eye makeup my lipstick my face makeup
everything I go through that stuff
pretty quickly because I just think it's
the bomb Dermalogica pre cleanse Katy
from my vanity hi Katy she said what is
your biggest goal for 2018 that's a good
question I feel like I have a couple
goals for 2018 one of my biggest goals
for 2018 is to kind of like I don't know
how I would describe this for sure but
kind of like get on our feet again my
husband lost his job in January and it's
kind of been like it's kind of an you
know just a weird couple months of
dealing with something like that because
I mean that's a pretty big deal if
you've gone through that it's a pretty
big deal we actually went through it as
a family when I was a little kid I
myself too had lost his job and I can I
can actually remember it happening
because this work actually burned down
and it was it was a night where a bunch
of the guys came over and we're
discussing it and it's something that
sticks with me because even though I was
such a little girl at the time I can
vividly remember those guys sitting at
the table discussing this and some of
them were crying because they were so
upset about it and it was like it was
just one of those things that you always
remember so um you know it's obviously a
big big impact but getting back to like
a good rhythm I think is a really big
goal but to go along with that is like
is is having Mitch get a job or a career
where he's really happy and he's really
passionate about it I quit my job at the
hospital probably six years ago five or
six years ago I think it was to pursue
to pursue being able to do books the
full-time I'm a published author of a
book blogger I work for freelance
editing proofreading marketing for
authors and things like that and I went
full-time to be able to write more and
then around that same time it was it was
shortly after I left the hospital I'm
pretty sure it's when I started a
YouTube channel so I don't know I kind
of just call myself like a whole time
dreamchaser is my job title that I give
myself because I do so many different
things and I wear so many different hats
but being able to do this full-time
whether it be YouTube whether it be my
book stuff being able to do that
full-time is something that makes me so
happy and I feel very lucky and grateful
and blessed and I also remind myself how
hard I worked to get here but I've been
able to do this for so many years and
kind of one of my big goals was you know
well I'm off here pursuing my dreams
like my husband is still doing the
corporate job and he's still doing an
office job that he doesn't like and he
doesn't he doesn't love doing it but
he's doing it because he was our stable
income he was our health insurance you
know things like that and it was always
one of my goals to get to a place where
I'm like okay you know what I'm good I
can take care of us right now let's
focus on you let's figure out what it is
that you want to do that makes you happy
because sometimes I would truly feel
like guilty because I get excited to
work every day I'm excited to wake up
I'm excited to come into my home office
and work and I would feel you know bad
when he would come home and be so upset
and he would take homework baggage and
he would just talk about disliking his
job so much but I think he felt for a
long time that he had to keep doing it
for us and you know I think losing the
job was really in a way I really do
think it that it is a blessing because I
think what he is gonna do next is
something that he is very passionate
about and very excited about and he'll
be happy to go to work every day so
that's a big goal within my personal
life
there but that was a big goal in my
personal life I would also book six
should be published sometime soon she's
in proofreading right now in cover
design so it's out of my hands at the
moment it just depends on how quickly my
gal who was hired can get through all of
that but book six will be published
I would love to publish book seven in
2018 as well but I don't think that it
will happen it's it's being written
right now I have a bunch of scenes
written for it but I would love to at
least have it like in editing or even in
proofreading in 2018 I think that would
be pretty amazing because my next six
books are in a series it's a six-part
girlfriend series which I'm really
excited about so that's a pretty big
goal of mine as well I would also love
to travel out of the country in 2018 one
of my biggest loves my biggest loves is
travel and I have not been out of the
country in a very long time and I would
love to be able to do a really amazing
trip you know we have some life changes
ahead of us and I'm turning 31 soon
that's why we're on this vacation in
Arizona I turned 31 on the 23rd of March
and I know I know that kids are coming
sometime so I would really like to do a
big trip out of the country so those are
some of my goals for 2018 thank you for
the question Katie speaking of babies I
got two questions back-to-back from
Candice hi Candice one of my friends
here she just said babies and then the
very next question that came in from
snapchat from coops mammy says do you
plan on having children um I think we do
plan on having children we just don't
really know but I can see if probably
being within the next couple years or so
like I said I'm 31 so I know that I'm
not getting any younger but also that
having kids has never really been like
my top priority I'm not one of those
women that's like I was born to be a
mother I don't feel like I have that I
don't feel like I have that like
nurturing Jean and Mady and also from
coops naming she also said how many
siblings do you have I have an older
sister and also a younger brother from a
Kersey on this was on Instagram she said
for the Q&amp;amp;A and also general concern how
are you guys doing with Mitch's job
situation hasn't gotten any better
it definitely has I know for the first
couple weeks I mean I feel like
just hard when you go through a big
situation like that and like no matter
how positive you trying to be you're
just like wait what just happened here
um but it has been getting a lot better
he is working right now so that's
fantastic and like I was saying that I
think what he does next will be
something that he's really passionate
about it's more than just like he just
went out and got a job come it's a
really big life change career change for
you know especially for him but it will
also be for me as well it's just gonna
kind of change like the dynamic of
things and I think that we'll have to
move in all of that but as things are
still kind of processing and we don't
have anything like super official yet I
don't really want to like say anything
yet because once I do you'll understand
why I'm saying this but it's a little
bit more layered than just saying like
yes he got a job type of thing but it's
going in a really great direction and so
thank you guys for all the support
during that time both Mitch and I
greatly appreciated it and we're so
thankful for that because it really did
help us but yes um things are definitely
looking up so thank you for asking that
this is from Angela party coy on
Instagram as well she said for the QA
I'm curious what makeup look at you
typically do for work I feel
self-conscious wearing colorful looks to
work but my work environment is pretty
conservative this is what I do for work
I do not go into an office or anything
like that I have a home office in our
house here and I do YouTube you know I
do the the beauty side of things and
then I also am a published author so
though I actually do not have to leave
my house I will say that before I was
doing this full-time I was working at a
hospital and it was more on the
conservative side especially for like
makeup and clothes and things like that
but I'm definitely such a neutral lover
not wearing my neutral eye looks and you
know nude lips and things like that I
really did enjoy that but I will say
that I did wear false lashes to work
usually on Fridays usually Fridays was
my day that I was like I put a little
bit more time into my look but I would
pop on some false lashes because as long
as they're not like super overly
dramatic I just
like kind of amp up and I look even if
you're doing something really neutral
and not super colorful or another way
that I really like to incorporate color
without being too much is to put it on
my lower lashline a lot of times I'll do
something super super simple on my
eyelids and I'll put like a blue or a
purple or something on the lower lash
line to kind of give it more of a Vavoom
without being like too much so that's
kind of how I would do it when I was
going into the office let's see
Bailey lol from Twitter said favorite
smaller creators I actually did a full
video on eight of my favorite youtubers
under eight thousand subscribers so I
will have that one a link down below if
you haven't seen it yet I just talked
over eight you know smaller creators
that I absolutely love and would
recommend so I will have that one listed
in my description box in case you would
want to watch that from mica sellers on
Twitter says what are some of your
favorite music artists and songs also
whatever your what are your favorite TV
shows my favorite music artists and
songs I feel like it always changes so
much right now I'm totally unlike the G
easy card EP bandwagon every time we go
out we're always listening to No Limit
love that Demi Lovato songs are really
like speaking speaking to me lately as
well I definitely do like a lot of like
hip-hop and rap I actually am a rap
superstar I don't know if anyone knows
this but I am but at the same time I
also really enjoy more like rock I was
just listening to asking alexandria do a
cover of Ed Sheeran today and I was
putting it on my Instagram because I
just I love asking alexandria Escape the
Fate avenged sevenfold Bullet For My
Valentine we just saw those two last
bands and concert not too long ago so
it's kind of like my style of reading as
well like I feel like I'm on two
different ends of the spectrum there
when it comes to music but I also love
going to concerts I think they're so
much fun my favorite TV shows I don't
really watch a lot of TV I just don't I
just don't really have time but
sometimes I'll try to like record shows
on the DVRs when I'm working out or
something playing and right now I've
been watching designated survivor it's
kind of starting to lose me a little bit
though there's just always so much going
on in that show I also watch it's
suppertime that was my husband and the
host of that show
is so freakin funny I wish I knew what
channel it was on I don't we record it
and then we watch it together but it's
such a funny dude and he cooks he makes
food and he explains how he's doing it
but he's just it's just so fun it's not
your average cooking show he's not your
average chef at all it's supper time
with Matty Masterson matter Matty
Matheson that's one of this and son is
from Carla on Twitter she said do you
enjoy indie brands as much as high-end
brands I would say yes I actually have
Davina cosmetics on my eyes today as
always I'll I'll link all of my makeup
in the description box but I I do really
enjoy indie brands I have my second in
the brand video on my schedule and I
want to get a couple more play a few
more times with the Divina eyeshadows
because I wanted to include them in my
next indie brain video I feel them
sometimes there can be a really hard
balance on YouTube between indie brands
and like the more mainstream brands
because when you do a lot like this is
what I've noticed for me personally when
I talk about any brains a lot where a
lot from them with a mend a lot from
them you know the comments are of course
always mixed but I feel like I get a lot
of comments like well I can't you know
that's they're not easily accessible
their shipping is too high you know I'm
not familiar with them I don't want to
purchase them yet because I don't you
know I haven't tried them out you know
you get comments like that but then when
you do I do mostly mainstream it's like
how come you never do indie do you like
any indie brands like it's just it's a
really hard balance between the two but
I try my best but yeah I would say I
mean yeah I would say I like indie
brands just as much as I do the the more
mainstream brands for sure
let's see Natalya here on Twitter she
has a few different questions here she
says which are your favorite YouTube
channels I have so many favorite
channels my watch later list is always
soulful but I have a really great group
of friends here on YouTube from live
from level ups her makeup Kelly Gooch
Kelly bow say Angelica I feel like I'm
gonna miss people and I do this and I
know us five we did a collab pretty
recently so I always kind of like list
them off first because I remember us
from that collab but Lisa Stevens I just
met Georgia here'sh actually
came down Iowa we did collab videos
together which was super super fun so
loved her yeah I just I have so many
like YouTube friends that so it's so
cool but those are definitely some of my
favorite channels as well my ultimate
favorite book I feel like my ultimate
favorite book from like a childhood
would be Christie's great idea by Anna
Martin which was the start of the
baby-sitters club the baby-sitters club
had a huge impact on my life I read all
of the baby star club books and I
actually didn't have like the best
childhood went through some pretty
crappy things and turning to books
really helped me it not only helped
teach me life lessons but I felt like it
it kept me on a really good path and
especially the baby-sitters club I mean
you can probably tell from the series
name that it was gonna keep me on a
pretty good path
so Chrissy's great idea I felt like
really it really opened me up to the
series it kind of sparked my desire to
be a writer and it just I really did
have a pretty big impact on my life and
either that one or something borrowed by
Emilie Giffen that is the book that I
read that I thought you have to stop
putting this off you've wanted to write
a novel for how many years you're going
to do it and so I think it was two days
after I finished reading that book I
started my book blog and I got on the
path to publishing of my first novel so
those two books are have been really
impactful in my life I would say she's
also asked how do you deal with negative
criticism it's definitely tough and for
a while I felt like I was that person I
was like Native comics just don't really
get to me you know I'll just delete them
and I'll move on but I don't feel like
that's true because definitely the
negative comments are those are the ones
that run through your mind and run
through your mind and I always have to
remember like okay yeah so you got a
negative comment on this but like a look
at the the 20 positive comments that
came in you can't focus on the negative
and that's what I just always try to
remember and I go back and I read my
comments a lot and I always recommend to
people to leave positive comments and
other videos if you're someone who
doesn't really comment on youtube if you
can find something positive to say in
any video I think that is a really big
deal because sometimes I know other
creators do it too we look back and we
look for those positive comments because
a lot of times when the negative
comments come in a lot of times that are
like personal you know they're attacking
you
personally they're finding something
about you that you're probably already
insecure about and they're attacking
that and that's why it hurts so bad you
know what I'm saying so I always try to
encourage to leave positive comments
because that helps me so much being able
to look back at them and be like okay I
don't suck not everybody hates me a good
type of thing no Jamie Lynn from Twitter
says if you could only have one beauty
product what would it be pretty sure I
know the answer is pure lashes but maybe
I'll be surprised lol and how do you how
do you deal with negative comments on
your channel so I kind of touched on
that one but if it I could if I could
only keep one beauty product and not
just makeup it would probably be like
moisturizer in my skincare routine I'm
like a moisturizer fiend
I love having nice moisturized skin so
probably a moisturizer or an eye cream
would be that but if I had to choose
makeup it would be a concealer my
favorite concealer right now is Urban
Decay Naked skin so I just feel like
concealer is so helpful to for your
under eyes if you have any circuit
imperfections you need to cover up like
my mother probably concealer so
moisturizer or concealer those would be
my topics so that I said I wasn't gonna
make those so super long and I've
already had to let my camera cool down
twice now hey I just got I had so much
fun doing these videos I forgot how much
fun cute eyes are okay so it's Megan s
from Twitter says if you could have one
lippy until the end of time what would
it be
I've been sitting here thinking I think
I came up with the maybelline truffle
tease it's just such a nice lipstick I
go back to it's so often it continually
finds its way into my purse it's a
really light brown nude it's creamy it's
easy to apply like I just feel like it's
just like my go-to if I don't want to
think about it but I still want to have
like a nice lip color and of course I
would have to be a nude I think I'm
gonna go with Maybelline truffle tease
and it's affordable so I could
continually be reviving it you know what
I'm saying and then her other question
is that was really hard the other
question is what are your favorite
videos creator plus video type to watch
such as Samantha March will I buy it I
know her or Jessica Braun hauls mm-hmm
that's a really good question as well
I feel like I feel like one of the
first things that came to my mind was
like some of my YouTube friends like I
mentioned earlier and I feel like
there's so many of my friends that come
up with such good like unique creative
ideas and I get so excited when I see
the post you know Kelly and Kaylee and
Liv and Lisa and Angelica I feel like
they all have really interesting kind of
like makeup chats so I really like to
watch those types of videos I always get
really excited when I see a pop up in my
feed or a new tag or something like that
I love watching Babs beauty and that
girl Shay excel for makeup tutorials and
then I love watching Casey Holmes vlogs
I'm not a huge blog person but I get so
excited when she post a new vlog because
I just love Casey and I love her dogs
they're some of my favorites that I can
think of off the top of my head I wish I
could go through with my watch later
list and see what's all on there but
those are a few off the top of my head
if I mention any channels or anything
like that
I'll have them all listed down below oh
I love watching I'm drea Matt silly ah
no I'm not a hundred percent how to say
her last name but I loved watching her
like shot my stash or her declutter
videos because really any of her videos
but those in particular I feel like show
off her editing skills so well her
editing I think is freaking phenomenal
and I feel like I comment that on her
videos so often but there's times that I
come in it and I'm like delete delete
that's the last thing you said on her
buddy to say something else but she has
beautiful editing like I will never be
to that level so I love watching those
videos because she just goes through
everything so well and she shows the
product and then she shows like a swatch
or she shows apply it just she's goals
man when it comes ed thank you my friend
Kelly from the K Bella Beauty she said
if you could travel anywhere in the
world where would you go and what is
your dream vacation destination I just
want to travel everywhere traveling has
been one of my biggest goals since I was
a young child I went to school for
travel and tourism because I couldn't
quite figure out what I wanted to do
with the rest of my life but I knew I
wanted to travel so it seemed like a
stealth major to choose I would just
love to go everywhere but Greece has
always been at the top of my list for
the longest time
that is one place I would love to go but
I've recently been looking into
locations like Belize I would love to
travel up there Bora Bora I think would
be absolutely amazing I would love to go
places that are like you know warm
vacation vibes but at the same time I
would love to go to places that have
history one of my favorite trips I've
ever taken was Amsterdam because it was
just so much so much history that I was
learning and you just learned so much
about a different culture the food the
jobs I mean how they get around
everything and it was fascinating to me
so yeah everywhere if that counts let's
see here we have nlh 1987 from Instagram
says if you could only keep one
eyeshadow palette to solely use for the
next year what would it be okay I'm
working on that if I could keep one tag
that Kelly I think she tagged me in it
but I saw her do it and I wanted to do
it anyways I've been working on that
video and I'm not sure I shadow palette
wise I don't like I want to say I'm a
sassy a modern mother Renaissance but I
feel like that's like such a cop-out but
it really is one of my favorite palettes
and one that I just constantly like when
I'm traveling it's like Oh what are you
gonna bring I'm gonna bring the modern
Renaissance I also kind of thought of my
dose of colors palettes right away but
those are only five shades and like I
feel like I at least I need to have the
option to have shimmers no no you know
what I think it would be you know what I
think it would be I think it would be my
my Jaclyn hell Murphy because it does it
has so many colors in there 35 shades
math shimmers colorful neutral red it
would be yes that's it morphe joking
hell if I had palette for one like you
use for one year that's what I'm gonna
pick that was hard and then we have from
Instagram Infinite midnight says here's
the question is it better to use a
setting spray on brushes for applying
eyeshadow or just water provide the same
results sorry if this is a silly
question you know I don't know if I
actually know about answers so if
anybody does leave it below I think
maybe I used water like back in college
I would I would run my brushes on her
water but I don't really remember if
that did much and like when I started
getting into makeup and after starting
watching YouTube one of my first
purchases was the mac fix+
and i've always used it for that so
if anyone does know leave it in the
comments but I'm not sure I feel like
the point is to get it damp but I don't
know at the same time I could be wrong
so I don't want to give bad advice
let's see sweet Lulu 23 on Twitter says
what makes you feel insecure and how do
you handle or overcome those
insecurities I feel like this videos
getting really long so I feel like I've
a feeling I've gotten deep early on in
the video so I won't take it too deep
here but one of my insecurities is my
ears if I can show you I've just a
self-tan so don't mind if I look a
little like crazy but I am really
self-conscious of my ears and like
really insecure about them so that's why
you hardly ever see me with my hair up I
also just really don't know how to do
hair if you can't tell but I'm very
self-conscious of wearing my hair up and
sometimes people will make comments
about it and like I know I understand
that my ears stick out but I just I
don't I mean I just try not to dwell on
it because it's something that like I
can't control like I don't have control
over that my mom actually told me this
story of when I was born the doctors
actually told her that I could do the
ear pinning surgery like as a baby
because they could already tell that my
ears were going to be sticking out and
mom declined because she said she
couldn't imagine putting a baby through
that surgery and I was always like mom
why don't you just do it I was so
insecure like starting cheerleading in
high school because we always had to
wear our hair up for games and practices
and I was like people are gonna make fun
of my ears like on my wedding day when I
was doing my wedding day trials I was
like I know that I want my hair up I was
like but can you pin can you use my hair
to pin my ears down and actually like
the gal was doing my hair she was like
you don't even know how often I get
requested to do that so no worries so my
ears my ears are big and security for me
April says if you could collab with any
makeup brand what brand would it be I
think would be cool to collab with
brands that I have been purchasing from
for a very long time or you know just
been supporting for such a long time
like Sigma comes to mind right away I
don't they really do like makeup
collapse with people like I've seen them
do like you know they kind of like
curate a collection of like favorites
and things like that that would be super
cool to do just because I you know
that's special
I was Sigma type of thing but also like
pure cosmetics I started purchasing from
pure so long ago I talked about them a
lot on my channel I liked a lot of their
products as well I think I'd be really
cool to do some sort of collab with them
but yeah just like it's someone like my
old-school brands I think would be would
be pretty cool so if Kendra Choi says
what is the least favorite makeup
product you've ever used well maybe I
could say the Too Faced white chocolate
chip palette I really did not like that
eyeshadow palette that one I really
disliked and also the benefit push-up
eyeliner like I liked a lot of eyeliners
and even though there's there's a lot of
dud eyeliners none of them have like
really made me angry
eyeliner made me angry it just didn't
make any sense to me
so the two face are the benefit those
were two things I did not I did not
enjoy Kristina Bert or Xtina Bert from
snapchat says the question for your Q&amp;amp;A
would you ever consider doing a
meet-and-greet
I just love you you're my favorite ever
thank you oh I am totally doing me a
great I feel like I would be really
nervous and really scared because I'm
just always in my own like little bubble
but I totally would I just don't really
I don't know how I would ever foresee
like making that happen I live in Iowa
so I'm not in like la New York or even
something like Dallas Chicago you know
something like that
so I don't know like when or where I
would never be able to do a
meet-and-greet but it would be really
cool like I was hanging with Georgia
that's hanging with Georgia the other
day and she asked if I would ever do a
book tour and I was like who you know
but maybe one day maybe one day you
never know I'll let see Amy Laura says
my question for your QA is if you could
pick one brand to make it under there PR
list who would it be right now I would
probably say Becca Becca cosmetics I
love so many items from Becca somebody I
was Rebecca and I talk about them a lot
and I use them a lot and I still just
can't seem to get their attention one
day one day
véra be suits on Instagram said if you
could travel wherever you want where
would you go and why okay so kind of
answered that one before you know
anywhere everywhere Emily and Burma on
Instagram says are you ever gonna write
a mystery novel I would love to I would
so love to I would love to write a
mystery novel and I would also love to
write like a magical realism book but
those are two things on my writers list
that I just would love to accomplish
like magical realism like if anybody
watched the show charmed I loved charmed
where it's like there's magical parts in
it but it's also realistic at the same
time kind of thing you know I would love
those are two genres I would really love
to to be able to write Susan on Twitter
says has nothing to do with makeup but
would you rescue or foster are you
sticking to one breed since you already
have knowledge of a bee Sheila I love
how much you love Aries fun fact about
me is I'm actually allergic to dogs I'm
like highly allergic to cats but I'm
very much allergic to dogs so when we
were actually wanting to get a dog we
did a lot of research on - what dogs are
hypo and then we found the beach love
through it that way so I think that we
would definitely stick with a visually
we love the breed so much we understand
the breed because they're definitely
they're interesting dogs for sure we
would love to do that but we've been
trying to rescue a beach low we've
looked on like the Iowa Beulah rescue
and there's a couple other rescue pages
for our surrounding states we've been
looking for probably like two years and
there's just really not a lot out there
which is like good at the same time but
on the flip side we would love to rescue
a dog but just really not a lot of
availability I feel like that sounds
weird to say but we've been looking for
that but arias is for now and if we do
want to get a second dog we really want
to get one soon before she gets too old
which is heartbreaking to say we want
her to still be able to enjoy a puppy or
a younger dog or what not so we're kind
of getting down to like we either need
to get another dog or we're not gonna
get another dog until after I'm gonna
stop talking about that cuz I'm gonna
talk about that but yeah that's a big
thing so we can't just rescue
unfortunately any dog we would have to
know exactly what kind of breed it is
and a lot of times when it comes to
rescuing at least from what I've seen
it's a lot of like mix breeds and stuff
because I mean it would be absolutely
devastating if we brought home a dog
and realize that we couldn't have it in
the house because I'm too allergic to it
so that would be home I gosh oh that
would be so horrible
let's see Katie short on Twitter says if
you can only buy and use one brain and
make up for the next year what would it
be and why what brand would you love to
club with and what youtuber would you
love to collab with I could only buy and
use one brain to make up the first the
first brand that popped in my head was
Urban Decay I know I love their
foundations concealers a bronzer off the
top of my head i shadow palettes
eyeliners lipsticks i think it would be
urban decay that's the first one that
came to my head what brand you'll have
to club with I answered that what
youtuber would you love to collab with
any of my friends that I've mentioned
throughout this video and like bigger
wise like I would love to collab Casey
homes or even like the channels that I
mentioned to like Babs Beauty that girl
shade that would be so cool really just
anybody I would love to do more in
person collapse after I did one with
Georgia like I would love to go to
people like I really would love to go to
people because I would give them an
excuse to travel as well maybe one day I
know like journalist reviews is doing
like a Travel collab series type of
videos and I'm I love to do that one day
that would be so cool okay I really do
need to wrap this up okay we're
overheated again Ian it's almost out of
battery but I just have one more
question that I saw come through this is
from a Miss P 1911 on Instagram it says
how do you manage your writing and
makeup isn't it hard you post every
single day you test out makeup and
skincare at the same time you write
books too how do you manage everything
that's my question that is a good
question um for me I just
I'm definitely highly self-motivated
which helps I have a huge passion for
what I do so my work to me doesn't feel
like work there's definitely times like
right now getting ready for a vacation
and trying to just make sure
everything's ready so I don't have to be
working on vacation I've definitely felt
the pressure and I've had those moments
of like I feel like I'm working and I
have all these deadlines and I need to
get things done but for the most part my
work to me is fun and it's something
that I choose to do and I just genuinely
love doing it so there's times where I
will walk into my office at 7 o'clock in
the morning and I will look up and it's
11 o'clock already and I'm thinking what
how did this happen because I just
really love what I do but I'm also I'm
pretty organized I do like I have a lot
of to-do lists I have a lot of calendars
I might keep myself on a pretty good
schedule my schedules to me are super
important like I'm someone who needs a
schedule so I have my morning scheduled
out my afternoon scheduled out and I
typically will schedule out my evenings
as well and it just helps me keep
everything I think it helps me know what
I have to do would have to get what has
to get done what is my priority what is
something that I can put off etc so
organization to-do list being
self-motivated so other than that that's
gonna do it doesn't mean the last
question for this Q&amp;amp;A oh boy okay so so
that is everything for my oh I thought
this was gonna be a short Q&amp;amp;A and this
probably just turned into an hour-long
video but I hope that you liked it I
hope you maybe found out something new
about me something that you didn't know
or anything like that let me know what
you thought down below did anything I
say surprised you not so much surprise
to you if you have any other questions
for me you can leave them in the
comments section but like I said I will
be on vacation with this video does go
up so if you notice I'm not responding
to comments as quickly it is because I
am giving myself a break and try to
enjoy myself in Arizona but thank you
guys so much for watching thank you to
everyone who asked a question I
appreciate it so much if you guys did
enjoy this Q&amp;amp;A I hope that you'll give
it a thumbs up I hope that you'll also
consider subscribing before you go and
I'll catch you guys in that trance video
