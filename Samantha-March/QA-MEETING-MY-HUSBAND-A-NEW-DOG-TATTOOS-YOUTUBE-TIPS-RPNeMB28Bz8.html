today's video is going to be a Q&amp;amp;A
listening I've been seeing an updated
Q&amp;amp;A being requested for quite some time
now and we're finally going to sit down
and I will answer some of your questions
so I asked on Twitter and then also my
snapchat if you would send me in some
questions that you want me to answer so
I'm just going to try to get through as
many as I can and I hope that you guys
enjoy this sometimes I I feel a little
weird about doing a Q&amp;amp;A because I I've
always kind of confused that people like
care or have questions I don't know it
just it's kind of a funny thing but I've
seen this being requested so many so
many silly dives and I know my channel
has grown a lot recently so I think a
lot of people would like to maybe know a
little bit more about me so that is what
I'm hoping to accomplish today I am
still posting on a daily basis right now
so if you do enjoy getting daily content
on makeup and beauty I hope that you'll
consider hitting the subscribe button
before you go but if you'd like to learn
a little bit more about me with a Q&amp;amp;A
session I want ways out head and get
started from Twitter a question came in
from naziha hopeless on your name right
so I kind of have a lot of questions for
you lol like how did you and Mitch meet
and your love story
how did mention I meet Mitch and I met
in college and we started dating
probably a year she was 18 and I was 19
so we've been together for 10 years we
celebrated 10 years in April of dating
we'll be married for 4 in September and
then another question she had is
whatever what is my top 3 favorite
movies of the clueless Legally Blonde
and then probably else else just kills
me her last question is who is my
celebrity crush I don't really crush on
like celebrities like actors or like
musicians or anything like I love
athlete Chris Bryan clay Mathews Kris
Bryant claim it's just kind of like
Chris and clothes line survive Chris
Brian plays for the Chicago Cubs clay
Mathews plays plays for the Green Bay
Packers and gives you did enough
question from this set is my Q&amp;amp;A
question is about writing how do you
conquer writer's block and she said love
your channel thank you so much so I am
an author if anybody does not know that
I am an indie author I have 5 published
novels this one you see on my wall is my
latest novel defining her I do always
have all of my books so linked down
below in my description box they are all
available on Amazon as an e-book and
then also as a paperback guide conquer
writer's block is to just keep writing I
can't tell you guys how much crap I have
written like things that just don't even
make sense
scenes I don't make sense to the book
I'm writing but you just have to write
to overcome it because if you just
freeze up and stop writing it is really
really difficult to get back into the
swing of things this question from Mars
is if you could live in one place for
the rest of your life where would it be
it would be somewhere warm I live in
Iowa and we get really bad winters like
we get like two to three months of
actual legit like warm summer weather
and everything else is just colder the
winters can go on forever
it can start snowing before Halloween in
October and it doesn't stop until April
and you're just like I just want to be
somewhere warm I want to walk outside my
house without worrying about a coat and
mittens and a hat and what is my car
gets stuck do I have warm enough boots
do I have you have to have an emergency
kit in your car in the winter if you
leave because you don't know if you're
going to get into a car accident and get
stuck and possibly freeze to death like
you have to have an extra coat you have
blankets in your car you have to have an
emergency pack with water and granola
bars in your car it's ridiculous I just
want to walk outside and just be outside
but no in the winters there's so many
different other things now you have to
think about it super annoying so just
really anywhere form that's all so this
one is a snapchat question from Ilhan
says let's see when did you write your
first book
technically I wrote my first book when I
was like nine I used to write like
spin-offs from the baby-sitters club if
anybody's familiar with the baby-sitters
club from an M Martin I used to
literally I would just take the
characters off of her pages and I would
write my own little books and my
my notebooks I mean I will create full
story I don't know how many words they
were but they were a full store there's
beginning a middle and end there was all
the secondary characters were in there
but I wasn't I didn't make up like my
own character I think but I made up
their own settings and then I did the
same thing with mary-kate and Ashley I
was a huge mary-kate and Ashley Olsen
fan when I was younger too I liked first
actual book I started writing it when I
was 18 18 19 was when I started writing
it but I believe I was 21 when I
published it 21 22 so and she also says
what countries do you want to visit but
never have a chance to anyways I Love
You Samantha you're so pretty and
amazing and keep up the good work thank
you I mean I just want to go everywhere
I would love to travel it by traveling
has always been a huge passion of mine I
actually went to college and I have my
associates degree in travel and tourism
and then I have my bachelor's degree in
business but I went I couldn't decide
what I wanted to do and you know
everybody was like oh just go and get
your Jenna's and do that and then I saw
this AIB College of Business in Des
Moines and they also offered travel as a
major and I was like I want to major in
travel I didn't even know that meant but
I was like now imma do that and it was
awesome we got to go to Amsterdam or
first year like it was part of our
curriculum was that we would plan the
school trip we would plan the flights
and the hotel and activities and study
the you know currency exchange and the
language and all the other stuff within
at the end of the year we actually got
to go on the trip it was really amazing
so it was an Amsterdam our first year
and we went to Jamaica a second year but
yeah I would love to go everywhere Italy
is probably my top top choice that I
would absolutely love to go to that
would be amazing but I would just love
to go everywhere and just be able to
experience different cultures and
different lifestyles I think that it's
super super fascinating to me I love I
love going on trips to where I can like
lay on the beach and relax and you know
that's amazing - I've been to like st.
Lucia for our honeymoon and we did the
Bahamas so you're after for one-year
anniversary and those are really fun but
at the same time like we were going into
like the the main part of the town and I
was talking to all the people and asking
the kids about their school and what
they do after school or they do for fun
like
access is what is really interesting to
me and like a big reason why I love to
travel so this is from Mac 8 LM on
snapchat it says how many catches you
have if you're comfortable talking about
them and what are they what are they of
thanks I'm going to go watch the Lilla
buy it now I like that so I have what do
I have one two three three tattoos I
have one on my foot I do on my foot in
Chinese letters that translate loosely
to to travel because I love traveling
that was the first tattoo I got I was 18
when I got it and it was one that I just
always wanted to do something was
travelling like that's all of my tattoos
have some sort of certain meaning all
three of my tattoos have some sort of
like certain meaning but travel was one
of my very first passions it sounds
really weird but my grandmother always
had all these encyclopedias in her house
why I have no idea but I would take the
encyclopedias and I would find like I
would look up different states and I
would write down everything about the
state the capital the state bird the
state flower like the population at the
time I would just try to study like when
I would go to her house I would have
like study sessions like I was always
been a huge nerd obviously but I would
have liked study sessions with myself
learning about all the different states
like I always did like puzzles of the
the map of the United States I would put
together like puzzles and stuff
obviously I went on to major in travel
and it's just been it's always just been
a huge huge passion of my I wanted a
tattoo that meant a lot to me and I
found a lot about it and I still love it
and a lot of people are like oh you guys
on your foot because you know travel
walk I'm like didn't even think of that
but let's go with that one
and then my second one I don't know
you'll be able to see us behind my ear
let's see my right ear you guys can see
it I don't know how pink it is it's
really hard for me to see but it is the
breast cancer ribbon my brother passed
away from breast cancer so I got that
one for her that one was on I want to
say it was like my
25th or 26th birthday maybe and my mom
is there with me so that was really
special with her mom who passed away so
that ribbon is in memory of my
grandmother and then my third one is on
my finger here I get asked a lot of
questions about this tattoo so I don't
know how to say that word bribery
it's Latin and it translates loosely to
to write in Latin I again I'm an author
I'm a published author and I always
wanted to also to have a tattoo that
something about reading or writing or
something and so I thought it could be
really cool to have to write on there
especially in the Latin language I
thought would be really nice and I just
really wanted it on my finger my
original plan was actually to get on
here I wanted to get march on here and
then have it because like you hold your
pen between these two fingers
I've always still kind of considered
doing March right here might someday but
yeah that is my third and final tattoo
this is from looks like l'hotel 43 on
snapchat she said I have so many
questions about Ares when did you get
her why aware that the name come from
so we got Ares it will be four years in
November and we got her from someone
near Mitch's hometown here in Iowa she
is a villa and a reason we decided to go
with a vishwa is because I'm actually
really allergic to dogs it was just so
sad and so any dog that we get has to be
hypo like we have to know that they are
hypo I did an allergy test anyways with
her I remember the day I did an allergy
test with a chocolate lab my husband
grew up with a chocolate lab he always
wanted laughs and I've always been
allergic to dogs and I've always said
that to them and I was like I'm pretty
sure I'm gonna be able urger to lab like
it's not my dog allergies aren't so bad
that I can't be like in the same room
with a dog but if a dog is like going to
lay on me for a long time or like we
wouldn't be able to have a dog but like
sleep in the bed with us type of thing
because like my friend Shannon has a
German Shepherd and I'm allergic to him
but it only starts to flare up if I've
been around him like all day or like
when I
time for an entire weekend I'll notice
like breakouts on my arms and on my
chest things like that and then like we
take areas to a doggy daycare sometimes
and obviously there's a time freezer so
when she gets home we immediately have
to give her a bath or I will break out
all on my arms along my chest like I'll
get like hives on my stomach and stuff
so that's a bummer
so we were really limited in what dozen
we could get which was sad so we ended
up with a visual because we didn't want
a really small dog but we didn't want
like a huge dog either and then my
husband does hunt so he wanted some type
of hunting breed so we were really
between a villa in a Weimar Reimer
I think where the other dog dogs that we
were going to get and it seems like
visual has had a little bit more of like
an even temperament type of thing and we
also were really intrigued that a lot of
people call them the velcro leash laws
because even though there's big dogs
females are typically between 40 and 60
pounds and then males or can even get up
to 100 but they don't grow themselves to
their owners like they just love their
owners so much but they always want to
be biased like Aries sleeps with us and
she sleeps in the middle of a she needs
to be touching us at both times she's
always on our laps we share a chair
together in my office if you follow me
on snapchat we somehow both spit on a
chair I don't know how it works when we
go for car rides together she's on my
lap with my just driving like it's
actually kind of hysterical like we knew
that going into it but we didn't
understand the extent of it she's not a
dog that will sit next to you or like
lay on the floor by your feet she on
your left and it's kind of funny so
that's why we ended up going with the
Beulah breed it's just because of my
allergies it was really devastating the
day to that allergy test and my whole
arm broke out from that chocolate lab
like my husband's face was just like
that's like oh sorry dude but I have a
pretty good feeling so that was going to
happen and where did the name come from
I'm an Aries and so is my husband we're
actually only four days apart a year a
year and four days apart I mean you're
older but um we are both Aries so that
is how we decided to name her so Stevie
says if you have you ever had to call
911 so why I have never had a common one
one thankfully because that that would
have to be
fine no matter what it is you're calling
for I'm sure drink all my won-won it's
terrifying APR 9 2016 8 Inc all four
years I did cheerleading for football
and basketball this is from Sydney she
says I have so many questions what's
your biggest inspiration as an author I
think my biggest inspiration would be I
want to save my life but not not
necessarily it's kind of hard to explain
how would I spend us there's been a lot
of like bad situations that I've been
through and then at the same time just a
lot of interesting situation so I've
been through and every time I've gone
through a certain situation unlike
someone might find that interesting to
read someone might find that helpful to
read but I also think there has to be a
reason I went through this like there
has to be a bigger reason of why I went
through this situation and to me it's so
I can write about it and so I can pass
it along to others because when I was a
kid we had a really bad several
situations happening and I would escape
into books I would escape into the
baby-sitters club I would escape in a
Sweet Valley High to take my mind off of
what was going on to get lost in someone
else's world that was so much better
than mine but at the same time I also
learned a lot because just for certain
situations that were happening when I
was growing up I didn't always have like
I mean obviously don't have the social
media that we have today and then or
none of them all that but I learned a
lot from those books I learned a lot
about life I just I learned a lot of
valuable lessons from my books or
something that I really do think helped
shaped me into Who I am and if I didn't
have my books and I wasn't as invested
in reading as I always was growing up I
honestly worried about where I would be
today not as a 100 percent true
statement and so that's kind of scary
but that's kind of where my inspiration
comes from if I'm dealing with a bad
situation it's kind of therapeutic for
me to write about it and also to try to
like if someone hurts me or something
like a friend its therapeutic and also
interesting for me to try to get into
our mindset to try to write it from a
dick
point-of-view - I feel like it's
interesting and can really help me out
but the biggest thing is I hope some of
my books are helping someone else like
books helped me she also says what jobs
have you worked in the past my first job
was at a pizza place I was 14 I was
called Papa Murphy's and I got fired
because I went take my acrylics off why
would you hire me when I had acrylics on
why don't you have on like hey I work
here you gotta check your acrylics off
it was like a month into the job I
always says a cash register
like I didn't make the pizzas and if I
did make the pieces I put the gloves on
because that's what you should do so
like what was a big deal about my nails
it was like a month into it or something
they're like yeah you're going to need
to take off your nails and I was like no
that wasn't happening I also did
recovery at a JCPenney in a mall that
was like a holiday job where basically
you went to the dressing rooms and took
out everything that people left behind
and then put it back on the shelf oh my
god that was like the worst job ever I
hated that I was boring I worked at a
Event Center in the concession stand
that was one of my bonus jobs ever I
worked with my mom I worked as my cousin
one day a friend worked there for a
while with me it was so much fun I got
to like see hockey games and concerts
and comedy shows and all of that and
then working at the concession stand was
also a lot of fun and it was my first
job was like tips it's a little super
cool I came to college I worked quite a
few different jobs but I did work at the
activity center at my school which is
like our gym checking people in and out
like cleaning the machines at night and
stuff but that was actually really fun
because it was on campus and you know
obviously all your friends came and so
so that was always fun I also worked at
a hotel at the front desk because once I
started my travel degree I decided I
wanted to work on a cruise ship because
I thought it would be a way to like
travel around to all these different
places and actually I don't know if it's
still a requirement but back then you
had to have two years experience at a
hotel to get like any sort of like good
job on a cruise ship so I immediately
went got a job at a hotel and I worked
out the front desk which was super
interesting I really really liked that
job - I had a lot of fun with that one
and then I've worked at a VA hospital
that was what I did before I started to
do full-time writing in YouTube I when I
left I was the new patient and relief
coordinator so I would bring
new veterans and help set them up for
our first appointment one I also did
manage a massage clinic for over a year
I think and if you want to read about
that experience
you can buy my novel the green ticket
because that was a weird weird job
experience very weird job experience but
it was really interesting about 20 years
old and managing a business that was
super interesting it's just a lot of a
hundy behind the scenes stuff that was a
little weird
and then she said when did you start
getting more YouTube views and
subscribers for your videos improving or
was it just constant growth I want to
say maybe it was around like the 10,000
mark or something around 10,000
subscribers I think it took me about a
year and kind of after that I think they
came in a consistent growth but I feel
like a lot of it had to do with my will
i buy it series once i started doing the
will i buy it I started to see
consistent views from that and more
viewers for coming in and and that was
really interesting but I think one of
the things that I did best was I
listened to the advice of a look at your
analytics and see what people are
watching see what see what your videos
that are getting the most amount of
views and then keep making those videos
and at the time so like last year it was
videos where I was talking about makeup
I was doing the will i buy it videos and
like best and worst videos and you know
makeup I regret buying and those types
of videos versus like the tutorials and
and other things like that so when I
started consistently like posting those
types of videos that's when I started
seeing a lot of improvements if you have
a youtube channel and you want to see
growth you know look at your analytics
see what videos are being the most
watched and then make those videos I'd
be my advice because that's when I think
I really started seeing growth is when I
started paying attention to that and
then her final question was how long
does it take you to film in at its
average video it takes me a really long
time to film depending on what exactly
the video is but I have the sony a 5100
which overheats at 13 minutes and then i
have to wait for it to cool down so
instead of being able to film straight
through i always have to take breaks so
it can take me
to two hours just a filmer video which
sucks what does it take me to edit my
videos usually I probably an hour I
would say they kind of put everything
together and then I go through to take
out like and you know repetitive stuff
and then I go through a third time to
just watch everything back and make sure
everything looks ok so it's going to
process I do it all myself I don't have
anyone helping me record or edit or
anything like that so and saw me and you
can take it can take some time but
that's okay because I enjoy doing it in
video questions in your Q&amp;amp;A but if you
are my question is what is that one at
Beauty favorites that you had like five
years ago and still use and totally
recommend all the time because I love
hearing what are those products that
even though you keep testing new makeup
it's still the favorite urine that
you're always going back okay so that
was a question from my friend Katie um
from my vanity she's using my moderator
on Tuesdays I'll have her channel linked
down below I'm interested in my favorite
youtubers that I watch too Assoc asked
what is one of my favorite products that
basically has always been a favorite
product and I always go back to probably
have to be the pure foreign one pressed
powder I've been using that since
college and I have gone through so many
of those and I still use them like
they're still there's other powders that
I like I like a couple of Maybelline
powders but I am still always always
reaching for that one is from Asia
official XL let's say it says how do you
deal with the YouTube and your personal
life how do you deal with always having
to make youtube videos even when not
being bothered or motivated in what
motivates or inspires you it's
definitely really hard to balance
YouTube and a personal life for me I
think it's it's not quite as hard
because I do work from home so it's
really easy to not easy but um you know
I can take my time during the day when
my husband is gone and this is where I
can do it all I can either write for my
novel I can edit I can film I can do
that all during the day and I mean I
work almost every single night as well
you can just as much because it's
something like he's like sometimes I
feel like I should to write you out of
your office but if we're not doing
anything if we're just sitting around at
home it's really hard for me not to go
in my office and keep working but it's
because I love what I do so much I'm
excited every
day to get up and go to work and I
understand that not a lot of people can
say that so I feel like you know I just
feel like that's such an awesome feeling
but it definitely can be hard to balance
especially about that I'm doing a daily
upload for the summer that was really
challenging or there's been a couple of
times when I've had to like turn things
down and and not be able to go out to
dinner or do things like that because I
know that I need to be working so it can
be hard but mitch is definitely the
person who helps me the most making sure
that I stay balanced and if I'm having
too much time in my office use the first
one to tell me like hey you need to take
a step back and then how do I deal is
always having to make youtube videos for
not being bothered or motivated I don't
think that's ever been a problem of mine
because I enjoy doing it like this is
fun for me if I'm having a bad day it's
fun for me to do my makeup and to come
on camera and to talk like that's what
cheers me up the only times where I felt
like I don't want to make a video is
when I don't feel good like like it
physically feel sick like that's hard
and then you just feel like your whole
game is off you know you just feel like
everything's off and you sound weird and
you look weird so that's the hardest
time to film in or when I'm going
through something really really mentally
challenging I deal with depression like
so many people do and when you're in a
funk so hard it can be hard to come on
camera and be like hi hi hi hi I'm super
happy look how happy I am when you're
not feeling that way but at the same
time it also it does help cheer me up so
it's an interesting balance but I don't
feel like there's ever been a time where
I haven't been motivated or haven't
wanted to film a video if anything I
wish I could film more videos honestly
like I wish I could but you know I
upload every day so there's that I
thought was my favorite food I love
Chinese food
I love tackled big fan cereal purple
skittles chips you know that nachos
nachos are like some food so I deal with
negative people the biggest thing with
dealing with negative people as I try to
focus on the positive people because
it's so easy to have 100 great comments
come in and one bad comment come in and
you just focus on that bad comment like
all these other fabulous wonderful
comments that should be uplifting and
positive they just kind of float away
when that one
if comment comes in so I really try to
focus on those positives and I didn't do
this before but I've recently started
doing it where I just start deleting the
negative comments because some people
you just why should you have to sit and
listen to to that about you and it makes
you want to respond and it makes you
want to defend yourself so I said this
on my snapchat but I said I'm going to
start looking at YouTube as like my
house YouTube my house and when I throw
a party
aka upload a video and you come to my
house and try to start a fight with me
I'm gonna kick you out that's how I'm
looking at YouTube right now because it
used to be like oh I want to leave the
negative comments because follow blah
unless they were like something super
bad and I was but like just people
starting to pick trying to trying to
start petty fights with me yeah I want
you in my house I don't need you in the
house because I got my other friends
coming to my house so this is from
Arielle she said did you start off
filming on your phone I sure did
how many describe how many subscribers
you have before you got a nice camera I
remember I got my camera with our tax
return money last year so I don't maybe
around like four five thousand maybe so
the next question is from Mary Camille
22
how old is Aires it shall be for in
September and then she is all throw dog
since you're home a lot 100% 100% velcro
dogs it's sometimes it's comical like
when I take a shower
hey I can't let her into the bathroom
because she will try to get in the
shower with me but when I shower even
honestly even if Mitch's home a lot of
times I will open the bathroom door and
she's laying there pressed up against
the doors like what were you doing she's
so funny just a question from girls love
jeeps she said how did you decide to get
a villa
were there any other breeds of dogs you
were considering would you get areas a
friend if so another Vizsla or a
different breed I'm going to try Sean
why we got her we get areas a friend if
so another beach law I think that we
would get another visual if we were to
get another dog to us they're just such
a unique breed and I think so many
people say that about their dogs Brees
you know you're like become loyal to
them like when we pass people with
facial is really - yeah let's just talk
for a second like it's so funny we
do that with like other people's dogs
there was a time at a wedding where
someone came up to me they knew my
brother and they were like but you guys
are the ones with the visual awright and
we're like yeah we have a view - next
thing you know we're out it's like our
kids we're like you know this is her you
know showing the photos and stuff at a
wedding in the middle the way I'm
talking about our dogs like it's so
funny but I think that we would get
another visa we just love that breed so
much there's so much fun and it's like
how could I ever get another dog and
what if they don't want to sit on my lap
do they not love me that would be really
hard to collab with a company on a
makeup product what company would it be
and what products would you create
you're going to create something soon
girl that was my friend Alex from Beauty
attic next door I'll have her channel
link down below as well so she asked if
any brand I could collaborate with in
what would I collab on but such a hard
question because it's so it's honestly
just so hard for me to imagine it's so
hard for me to imagine ever being in a
position to have a friend asked me to do
something as amazing as doing
collaboration but I think if I were to
ever collab honestly what I would want
to do is false eyelashes because I love
lashes I'm not wearing them today but I
wear them like 85% of the time I love
lashes I love them I love them so much
I would totally want to collaborate with
pure because they just came out with
some freaking bomb lashes that I'm
completely obsessed with they did an
amazing job I would love to work with
them I have loved pure for so long like
I said with their pressed powder I
started buying out when I was like 18
years old and I've gone on to have a
pretty good pure collection I love the
brand I support them as much as I can
and their their recent lash
collaboration that they did was freaking
bomb so I was loved to create some
lashes with pure call me from mrs. rose
red she said what clouds would you like
to see and what would be your dream
collab for yourself so just kind of
touch about that with like pure and
eyelashes I mean really just lashes I
just want to make lashes that's what I
want no because that would be freaking
cool what collabs would I like to see I
would like to see more collabs like what
does he and Katie recently did with
those of color
I like to see how do I describe that
color it was just really inspiring to
see I like that they shared the whole
journey I like that they really had
their subscribers and like you know
family of subscribers involved I liked
seeing the work that goes into a
collaboration I liked seeing all that
behind-the-scenes stuff and I think a
lot of people are interested in that too
I just kind of touched on the whole just
slapping your name and face on a product
for a collaboration in my last will I
buy a video with some stuff that benefit
recently did and it easily has shocked
me the number of comments I'm not
kidding you 98% of the comments probably
are people with the same feelings as
mine so I think people want to see the
hands-on behind the scene work that goes
into a collaboration and in you know I
know I'm not necessarily saying brands
and people but that's what I want to see
from collaborations I think it's really
cool AHA desing Katie did that pre-party
I think that was really cool to have a
giveaway to let people come to that
party I think that was cool and that's
what I would like to see from
collaborations moving forward that's
just me so she asked about my favorite
food was I kind of touched on that but
yeah probably at least once a week you
see me eating like sweet sour chicken
you also see me eating nachos you also
see me eating a taco usually a burrito
those are like some of my favorite I
probably have a bowl cereal on a daily
basis and chips usually work their way
into my system at some point throughout
the day okay guys that is going to be
everything for the Q&amp;amp;A my camera is
