today I'm going to be doing a Q&amp;amp;A video
I've kind of been standing on social
media if there's any questions that you
wanted me to answer in this video please
let me know and I picked 10 to try to
like keep me on schedule because I feel
like if I was just like going through
questions I don't know how long this
would be so I tried to pick 10 that you
know maybe worth like the most asked
questions type of thing so i will be
doing ten this round but i hope to do
more QA so if you ask the question and
you don't see it in this video or you
think of another question please just
comment below and let me know and i will
save it for my next Q&amp;amp;A video i do
record off of my cell phone and i didn't
even think about it as i was writing
down the list of questions like the 10
that i chose to answer i completely
spaced that I should have written down
who was asking them and a lot of the Q&amp;amp;A
videos that I see youtubers do they have
their phone and they're like oh had this
twitter handle asked me this question
and I was like well duh I can't
obviously be looking on my phone while
I'm recording this video so I forgot to
do that but I will keep that in mind for
the next Q&amp;amp;A video that I do but if you
would like to know the answers to some
of your questions that you have asked
please keep watching okay so these
aren't in any order either I didn't
divide them up to like make sense i just
wrote them down on my notepad but one of
the first questions that was asked was
why did I choose to start YouTube and
I'm still very new on youtube I think my
first video went up either in like late
april or early may so i'm still very new
but kind of the reason that i started it
was simply to have another outlet to
talk to people and to connect with
people i started chocolate plus in 2009
as a way to form a connection with
people who have the same interests as me
which was books and reading and writing
and it just amazes me the power of
social media that we have these days
there are so many people that i consider
like my virtual friends who i talked to
it you know every single day every
single week online in some form whether
email or social media or now YouTube and
I just think that's really incredible
know that YouTube has been around for a
long time and I know it's been very
popular and I know that youtubers love
what they do and now I really do
understand it I honestly didn't know if
I was going to love you too bandit was a
reason why I didn't go out and like
purchase a fancy camera right away I do
now plan to because i plan on continuing
youtube I just haven't had the time yet
with our busy summer so I'm still
recording off my phone but from the
first few videos that I did i just
realized how much i enjoy doing it and i
love being able to talk about all my
different passions and just reach so
many other people i just think that is
really awesome another question that was
asked is what is my favorite place to
visit and that was really hard because i
wasn't sure if it was like favorite
place to visit like places that i've
been to before or like places that i
really want to travel to but i will say
that i'm a huge travel fanatic i
actually went to college for my
associates degree and that is in travel
and hospitality i chose it because I
honestly wasn't sure what I wanted to do
when I went to college so I just chose
something that had an interest to me
which was travel I love traveling places
that I really want to visit our like
Paris and Italy those are probably like
some of my two that are way up there
some of my place favorite places to
visit to Las Vegas twice and I've had a
lot of fun both times there one time was
a family trip at one time was actually a
business trip but still I have a lot of
fun going there I really like to go
anywhere with water may huge water
person and I'm a huge warm weather
person so anywhere that has like
sunshine and water whether it be a lake
and ocean like I don't care i just want
to be by water another question that was
asked about my writing was you know kind
of what is my process of writing do i
outline my books or do i just kind of
like right by the seat of my pants and
honestly so i have four books my fourth
book releases july 29 and it's kind of
in a different process for each of them
what I find myself gravitating to now is
outlining the general plot so I know who
my characters are I know instances like
where the really dramatic scenes are
going to come in I know how it's going
to end I know we're like the peaks are
in the book I plot all those out but I
don't necessarily plot each chapter like
I know what's going to happen in each
chapter I just know kind of where I want
certain situations to happen and then I
just right from there a lot of times
things will happen in the book that I
don't expect I didn't maybe have in my
mind it's just it honestly as my
characters doing what they want to do
and I'm just writing their story so
that's kind of what I've been seeing
working for me lately fourth book is
nearly in publication so I've started
outlining book five and that's exactly
what I did I have my characters I know
what's happening with the plot I know
where those bigger scenes come in and
then I'm just going to start putting pen
to paper or finger to keyboard and see
what happens another question about
writing was is there any books that I
didn't finish or that I didn't see
through and I wasn't sure if this meant
reading wise or writing lies but I
remember the person who asked it asked
several writing questions in a row and
so I'm gonna go with it's more on a
writing question that answer right now
is no my first book destined to fail I
actually rewrote it three times and when
I say I rewrote it I mean it was an
entire rewrite the book started out as
something completely different i sent it
to an editor and she came back with a
bunch of ideas and I took her ideas and
was like scrap that book let's make this
one and I rewrote the whole thing and
then i sent it to another editor she
came back with ideas and i was like
don't like that one either and rewrote
it so that's I don't know that counts
but that book was a full rewrite three
times and looking back I'm like you're
crazy but it is my first book I didn't
have any expectations I didn't have any
readers like hey when's your next book
being released how you feel after you
have books out then you start to feel
like you need to release books
consistent
no one really even knew that I was
writing a book not even some of my
family knew that I was writing so I
didn't feel the pressure and I just
really wanted to put my first book out
there that I loved and that I had my
whole heart behind and I'm happy to say
that the third one turned out that way
but as of right now there is not a book
that I've started writing and that I
just couldn't get into it I have written
a novella it's a holiday novella that
will come out more towards like the
November December time frame and I did
kind of plot an idea for a novella and
that's all the further i got was i I
plotted it out and was like mmm I don't
think that's going to work so I changed
gears and decided to go with a different
novella but I didn't actually like
really start writing it and give up on
it so and one person asked do I have a
favorite book that I've written and I
feel like that is so hard because it's
like asking to choose like your favorite
child or something so that's really
tough so I have four books dozen to fail
the green ticket a questionable
friendship and my latest one is called
up to i do but you should always say
like your latest one is your favorite
one because like that's the book that
you're excited about and honestly i'm
recording this about a week before the
release date for up to i do and i
honestly feel like I just feel so many
nerves like the week before release is
just so like heart-wrenching I feel ill
every day now my review copies have gone
out to book reviewers and every time
someone emails me or tweets me like hey
I'm reading your book I'm like oh my god
this is like oh I don't know how to
accurately describe this feeling but
it's just really crazy so I don't know
if I feel that excitement yet about up
to I do because I just mostly feel
nauseous right now so I'm actually going
to say that a questionable friendship is
my favorite one at this time and I think
it was really because I was able to use
so much creativity with this book with
my first two books they were each kind
of based on either certain things that
have happened in my life or experiences
that I've experienced and I wrote them
into the book but a questionable
friendship was really
all me and my imagination and my
characters really coming to life on the
page and so I feel like that book will
always be really special to me for that
reason it was the first time I felt that
I really like let myself loose and
trusted in my writing skills instead of
my life skills and experiences to write
a book doesn't make sense halfway
through question that was asked was what
do I feel is my greatest personal
achievement and that one was really hard
I thought about that one when I saw it
coming I think it was on Instagram I was
kind of like oh okay hmm and I had to
think about it and honestly I i think i
would have to say that i feel like my
greatest personal achievement is just
being where I am today we all have
situations in our lives that are tough
we all go through tough times and you
know everyone has a story and everyone
has baggage and I feel like so many
people have things that have happened to
them in the past that really make them
strive to keep moving forward and keep
doing better for themselves and you know
because I've gone through some things
there's been several times in the past
where been several times in the past
where I thought like I'm not gonna go
anywhere in life and you know just you
know just struggled a lot and now it's
so crazy to me because I own a home
which is so so wild to think about like
that's crazy that you know I'm 28 years
old I own a home I'm married to a
wonderful man but also just because I'm
working my dream career being an author
and working in books is something that
I've wanted to do ever since I was a
little girl and to be able to do it now
and to be able to support myself also to
know that I have surrounded myself with
people that believe in me and that
pushed me to keep doing what I'm doing
and that support me in what I'm doing I
feel like that's a really beautiful
personal achievement because I never you
know gave up on myself to the point
where I stopped trying or I stopped
believing in myself so
I think that is my greatest personal
achievement and hopefully know what
other questions make me cry because whoa
that's so not cool and there's a lot of
questions that came in about like am I
married enjoy have kids and some people
who know that I don't have kids was like
when are you having kids I am married I
will be married for two years in
September I met my husband in college
we've been together probably close to 10
years now which is kind of wild probably
nine years ferry two years ago in
September we welcomed our first puppy in
no in November after our wedding we have
Aires who is a visual puppy if you
follow me on social media I share
pictures of her all the time because
she's like our greatest joy we do not
have children yet we are both you know
just we're in our 20s and we're very
busy with life or busy you know getting
our careers figured out and you know
what we want to be would we grow up and
all that fun stuff we did buy a house
together right before our wedding have a
house we have a dog we have each other
travel we're still both very like travel
bugs and we go on several vacations a
year and this is not the right time in
our life right now to have kids but I
know that we both want them we just have
to take it a day a month a year at a
time and that came in quite a bit was
like what do I do for fun or one of my
hobbies I mean my biggest personal hobby
is reading writing which you know is
also part of my job and that I really
enjoy doing yoga and I also do run an
Instagram fitness page with one of my
friends for the cheeky chicks on
Instagram and we share yoga photos every
day but I practiced yoga daily and I
really love it also just working out in
general is something that I really enjoy
doing and something that I've always
enjoyed doing I like finding new
workouts to do I like kickboxing Pilates
yoga you know dance anything like that I
I like to do I'm a big sports fan so
right now we're at a baseball season I'm
a Cubs fan I enjoy watching the cubs
games on TV we're going to a cubs game
here in a few weeks I also really like
football I'm a green
Packers fan I like watching sports as
well and then just really we have a
large group of friends I like hanging
out with my friends and my husband and
my dog I'm just hanging out at home the
one question that probably got asked the
most is like can I explain what it is I
do and like all the different jobs that
i do and i won't really answer that in
this video because i actually created a
whole video on what I do and kind of
take you through my day and all the
different jobs that I do because I wear
so many hats you know I'm an author and
working freelance for editing
proofreading marketing I own a
publishing company and I work freelance
and several other bookish areas you know
I do that you'll go online I wear a lot
of different hats I do a lot of
different things and I know it can be
really confusing that people are like
what do you do or you're everywhere or
you do that too like that's crazy I feel
like that was something when i started
youtube people are like now you're doing
YouTube to like what don't you do but I
just have so many passions so lucky to
be able to do what I do because it gives
me the freedom to do so many different
things so I just think that's really
amazing and you know if something
interests me and I have a passion for it
and I want to dedicate myself to doing
it why not do it so you can click up
here and that will take you to the video
where I explain what i do and i will
also be sure to link it below as well in
the description box if you want to check
that one out last question that i have i
thought was kind of interesting because
i think it was though only like two
people ask this but I actually wanted to
talk about it so I want to pose another
question for you guys people are asking
me like what's in my purse or like what
is something that is always in my purse
that I can't leave my house with I was
curious because I've seen a few people
do like what's in my purse videos and I
like I've watched him it's always
interesting to see what a woman has in
her purse especially because we seem to
carry such large bags I do as well I
didn't know would you guys be interested
in me doing a what's in my purse video I
didn't know cuz that'd be something
pretty different for this channel but
people seem to really like him so I
wasn't sure and because i had a couple
people ask you know a question kind of
like that i thought i would just like
throw it
two guys and see if it's something that
you might be interested in so if you do
want to see that video please comment
below or let me know on social media and
I will try to clean my purse out of the
best I can my purse is large because I
always got a lot of stuff in there but I
few things that like I can't leave home
without one would be lip gloss because I
feel like I'm always putting lip gloss
on you know of course the usual things
like my phone in my wallet always has to
be in there I always carry usually like
two to three koozies in my purse because
you would not believe the amount of
times that we go out somewhere and one
of my friends is like oh man I wish I
had a koozie time always just like yeah
here you go I mean we have drawers upon
drawers full of koozies so I always
stick a few in my purse and that way I
can be like a lifesaver for someone who
didn't bring a koozie another weird
thing but I always like to have in my
purse is just like a little nail kit set
which I probably could have grabbed it
for you but it has like tweezers and
scissors and nail clippers and files and
things like that and it just is
incredible the amount of time that I
could asked like anyone have a scissors
everyone have a tweezers anyone have a
nail clip art like that thing has come
in handy so much I believe I got it as a
gift like a part as part of a Christmas
gift from my mother and lost several
years ago and that thing does not leave
my purse I travel with it it goes
everywhere with me so that's one thing
that I always want to have in my purse
as well yeah let me know if you guys
want to see that video because I'm sure
I can do it for you I'll try to take out
like all the receipts and gum wrappers
and stuff before I do that but yeah just
let me know so that's the wrap-up of my
Q&amp;amp;A video I hope you guys liked it i
hope you learned a little bit more about
me I hope to do you know these every
once in a while because I get so many
questions that come in and it's so hard
to answer back to everybody that asked
me in all of my different social media
accounts because i feel like i have
about a million but if there's any other
questions that you guys want please do
comment below and let me know or ask me
on the social media I'll be sure to put
something up there again what I'm going
do another Q&amp;amp;A video in the future so

learned a little bit about me and please
