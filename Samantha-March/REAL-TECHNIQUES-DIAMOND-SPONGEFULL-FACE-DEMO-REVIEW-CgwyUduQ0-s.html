today's video is going to be a like
first impression and demo on the new
Real Techniques is their miracle diamond
sponge so this isn't like brand new but
it is fairly newer and so I asked my
snapchat you know do you guys want to
see a video on it have you seen enough
videos on it and so many people like I
couldn't believe the amount of people
that said I've never even heard of this
I've never seen any videos on it and it
got so many screenshots to do this video
so I was like okay I'm gonna do this
video so again this is what it looks
like it is from Real Techniques they do
have a sponge it's like the bright
orange one I can grab my sponges in a
second here to compare them and then
they just came out with this one as well
obviously I'm curious about it because
of how it looks it's very eye-catching
to me really um I guess I started
thinking about it once I saw the
feedback coming in from my snapchat and
I thought you know the only video that
I've seen on this sponge is from kc
homes she mentioned this in a video and
then I saw her use it in a makeup
tutorial after that and she said that
she's still was really liking it so I
placed an order online from Ulta about a
week ago and I decided to purchase this
and then now we're going to go ahead and
see how it works so I do have some of my
eye makeup done not all of it because I
like to put concealer on before I finish
off like my under eyes and that sort of
thing but I'm going to test it out what
is foundation concealer cream contour
baking all that good stuff everything
that I've used my regular beauty blender
for I'm going to put it to the test see
how it works I can compare it against
the Real Techniques sponge and I can
also compare it against the Beauty
Blender I'm not going to use any of
those other tools on my face i'm going
to use only this and test it out for all
of those different functions to see how
I really think that it works sponge is
999 again I found mine at Ulta I have
only seen it online so far I just was
that ulta the day before i'm filming us
and i walked at the real technique
section and i did not see it in stores
yet but that might just be because i
live in small town iowa i don't know it
might be at your store but for me i've
only seen it online so from the back it
says this multifaceted miracle diamond
sponge is designed to work with multiple
products on different
rays of your face notice punches are
alike each has its own unique swirl
decide oh I didn't know that it's like a
snowflakes tell q still it says the top
is too buff and blend for a flawless
finish the larger flat sides function as
a wedge to apply makeup to larger areas
the smaller flat sides work around the
eyes mouth and brow bone and the pointed
tip cover small imperfections says use
wet for Dewey application and dry for
full coverage powders and you're
supposed to replace it every one two
three months so let's go ahead try this
out i'm going to go ahead and pry my
face and then we'll come back with the
foundation and get this wet and see how
it goes okay so i went ahead and got it
wet so it is a bit bigger now i'm going
to use my clinique beyond perfecting
foundation I did prime my face and then
I pulled my hair back as well so I'll
just supply us over my face and so this
sponge like i said is 999 one of the
Real Techniques sponges is 699 or click
on the Alta website you can get two for
1099 and then the Beauty Blender is
twenty dollars so those are just a few
comparisons for you so let's go ahead
and see how this works so like you like
it said it does have the flat top here
and then I don't know if you can see it
on camera real great but it has these
like smaller edges here and then it has
these edges and it has the pointed tip
like there's a lot to this so it's very
interesting so I'm going to use the top
first and go ahead and bounce it in so
one thing that I'll say is that I always
used the Real Techniques sponges I used
them for a while before i purchased a
Beauty Blender and I was like this is
the most amazing thing of life I
absolutely love this sponge and then i
bought the Beauty Blender and I was like
oh I think I actually loved it more than
the Real Techniques not that I don't
like the Real Techniques I just like the
Beauty Blender a little bit more but it
is very expensive and recently my dog
has come to also really love beauty
blenders she doesn't discriminate though
like the Beauty Blender the real
technique sponge I got a sponge from
pier cosmetics with their cambial
contour powder yeah she'll eat all of
them she doesn't care she doesn't she
doesn't discriminate like that so um I'm
having to become more crafty with where
I put my beauty blenders because no
matter where I put them she she's
finding a way to get them and she just
she had chewed up two of The Real
Techniques sponges and I was like okay
don't be mad you know they're 699 but
it's fine no big deal and then the other
night she chewed up my twenty dollar
nude beauty blender and I was like great
so the Sephora VIII IV sales coming up
for me real soon and I'm waiting for
like the vib access to start and then
i'm going to buy beauty blenders and
I've got this one and you know we're
just going to hide them in in better
places okay so what I have to say about
blending out the foundation again using
the top side of this is that because
it's so large I think I mean it it went
on very quickly I won't say it has as
much like thumps as the Beauty Blender
but it has more bounce than the Real
Techniques sponge so that was
interesting but yeah that really didn't
take long at all and then I'm just going
to kind of like flip it on the side and
just kind of make sure the foundation is
blended around my nose and my mouth I
really like the side that and I'm going
to do it in between my eyebrows too yeah
the side makes it really handy because
it can kind of get into those like
smaller areas okay so I like that so far
so far so good so far so good okay so
that's gonna be good for a foundation
let's go ahead and put concealer on okay
so this was just on the top it's my
better skin concealer from Maybelline so
go ahead and apply that on the under
eyes like normal and then also use it to
highlight areas of my face and then for
this part I'm gonna like flip it and i'm
going to use like one of these sides
here and see how that goes and i'm going
to have the pointed tip like pointing up
towards my i see how this goes you know
i have to say it like
the packaging really did like pull me in
I mean like diamonds are a girl's best
friend am i right but so I thought that
was really cute but I was like you know
what I want to see if if it actually
works I was really intrigued from kc
homes because not only did she really
enjoy it in her video where she was
testing it out but then she actually
used it in another makeup tutorial that
she filmed for youtube and that's kind
of my way that I know someone actually
really does like something because you
just hear too often you know Beauty
vloggers or youtubers like raping about
a product you know in a in a tested out
video or sometimes even a favorites
video they rave about it but then you
never see them use it and it's like wait
I thought wasn't that your favorite like
why don't you ever use it so when I saw
her use it in another makeup tutorial
and you know she still made a comment
and they're like still really like in
the sponge I was like okay okay maybe I
should get it and it blended out the
product super fast I really liked using
the side for that one and especially
having that pointed tip up towards my
eyes I felt like that like helped make a
difference so concealer went on with
absolutely zero issues so far still so
good okay okay so the next test is going
to be baking I'm going to grab some of
my maybelline loose setting powder and
use this to bake so I like that it's so
big because like I've gotten that side
dirty but now I'm just going to kind of
flip it around and I'm going to use this
side to bake so again I'm going to hold
it on the side of it and just dip it in
and then once again i'm going to use the
point in each side like towards my under
eye and we'll see how this works
so far so good i'll do the other eye the
maybelline powder i mentioned it in one
of my videos where I used it in a
tutorial it like doesn't show up right
away when you put it on I don't know why
it is but like once you like I don't
know let it dry or something it starts
to show up it's really weird like my
laura mercier secret brightening powder
shows up right as you put it on some
reason the Maybelline one doesn't and I
always think like my not using enough
product but it does show up it just
takes some time for whatever reason but
I'm almost out of my Laura Mercier
powder and i'm waiting for the vib sale
to get here before i make another
purchase so that's why i'm using the
maybelline one again or know if you'll
be able to really see the powder in the
camera with like the sunshine hitting
directly on here once again i mean it
applied really nice I don't have any
complaints about the baking going on so
i'll leave the baking to sit for a
little bit and i'll do some cream
contouring next ok so i'm going to pull
out my pure cameo contour stick i'm
going to use the contour side and go
ahead and draw some lines on my face
really like can't get over how much I'm
liking because I still have more areas
to be able to use the sponge that aren't
dirty yet I really appreciate that so
I'm going to take this flat side I'm
just going to go down like this and
blend it out
so first impressions it's blending very
well like I would expect it to so far as
I'm going through everything I'm quite
impressed with this I'm very happy with
my purchase so far it's all looking
pretty dang good to me okay I'm going to
go ahead i'm going to dust away the
powder and i'm going to like bronze and
probably like finish up the rest of my
face and eyes and then i will come back
and give you my final thoughts on the
diamond sponge okay so i just finished
off the rest my makeup real quick but i
am pretty excited about the sponge I'm
not gonna lie so just base up first
impressions using the black side here
for my foundation I felt like worked
really well because it was very quick it
blend it out very easily it was very
very fast and and then next when I moved
on to concealer and I used more of like
the side but then also the point up here
again blend it out really fast and I
just thought it was super easy I liked
the sharp point which comes on most of
the beauty blenders as well but I almost
felt like this one was like the smallest
most precise one because it was really
getting with us but and like the very
inner corner of your eye it really got
in there so I was impressed about that
baking is there wasn't any issue was i
fine to bake one and then even like
concealer superfine blended out easily
it was very quick but what I feel like I
like most about is I just feel like it's
bigger than the other ones and because
you have so many of the different sides
I felt like I truly could use this for
everything where sometimes if i use the
beauty blender or the other real
techniques sponge I almost feel like
sometimes like by the time i get to
blending out the contour I'm like should
I go clean this like it looks pretty
filthy but i felt like i was able to
just keep like moving it around and
moving it around and using it for
different purposes so i really like that
so this is kind of what the Real
Techniques regular makeup sponge looks
like again these are 699 it does have
the flat side that I like and then
usually it does have a point right here
but um like I said my dog it's all my
beauty blenders so there's that and then
also this is the only Beauty Blender
that I own it's one of the nude beauty
blenders so it has
up the rabbit side and again this side
normally would come to a tip but um I
have a dog so that's just kind of what
they look like and then again here is
what the diamond sponge looks like
obviously it's really dirty now because
I have used it but I liked how big it
was I liked all the different sides to
it i like that you are really able to
use it for a lot of different functions
like it's said like in the claims that
it said so i really appreciated that
overall I'm really impressed with it for
the price it's not bad at all like I
said you can get it at Ulta for 999 so I
didn't think that was about price at all
do I like it more than the Beauty
Blender I don't think so i think that i
still like the Beauty Blender more
because I like the way the Beauty
Blender like bounces on the face I don't
know how to describe it but it's like so
lightweight that I really like that part
but I like that this is bigger and I
like this point it end more I don't feel
like the Beauty Blender has as small and
defined point on the bottom of it so I
don't now I'm like I do i I really did
like this one you maybe this might have
to be something where I don't just use
it on a first impression I'll use it
again and you know a couple more times
to do my makeup and then really be able
to say do I like this more than the
beauty blender or not I do like this
more than the other Real Techniques
makeup sponge I will say that I could
kind of tell right off the bat because
sometimes the other Real Techniques one
the orange one it's a little bit too
hard for me no matter how wet I get it
it still is almost a little bit too hard
on my face this one is not hard at all
so I really like that so I definitely
like this more than the Real Techniques
I'm not quite sure yet where I place
with the Beauty Blender right now I
think I still like the Beauty Blender
more but honestly you know for the two
things that I said that I like this more
and for the price this one might
actually beat out the Beauty Blender I'm
going to give it a few more tries and
I'll let you guys know but based on
first impressions this is like
neck-and-neck with the Beauty Blender
and it's about half the price so this
one could be a definite winner I really
hope that you guys like this video or
found it somewhat helpful and to be able
to you know kind of show me using the
diamond sponge for the first time and
seeing how it works and kind of getting
my first impression and my feedback
again I can use it in upcoming makeup
tutorials and you know
be able to talk about it more maybe in a
favorites video or just a review video
coming up and let you guys know what I
think but based off my first impressions
I was very impressed with this I would
definitely recommend it as of right now
I can leave it link down below to Alta
and yeah I'm really happy so thank you
to kc homes for the recommendation
because i'm pretty darn happy with this
one as of right now I was impressed with
it what did you guys think do you guys
have it do you think you will get it let
me know in the comments down below but
so far the Real Techniques miracle
diamond sponge is getting a thumbs up
for me super happy that I found it
because you know now I need to buy a lot
more beauty blenders to replace the ones

find a new spot to hide my beauty
blenders I'm gonna have to work on that
