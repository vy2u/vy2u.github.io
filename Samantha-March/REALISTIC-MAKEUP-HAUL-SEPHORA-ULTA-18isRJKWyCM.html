today's video is going to be a new
makeup haul and have a couple items here
from both Sephora and Ulta that I
purchased recently and wanted to share
with you guys I'm also so excited for
today's video because I get to work with
eBay it's on this video and I love
Ebates so much so I am so excited to do
this haul with them if you guys are not
familiar with Ebates if you have not
heard me or anybody else to talk about
eBay it is such a good site especially
if you are a deal chaser like me with
Ebates of what happens if you're going
to be shopping online so when I'm making
a purchase from Sephora I just go to
Ebates first I find the Sephora store
click on it it takes me right to the
Sephora website and I check out like
normal there's no codes I need to put in
there's nothing else that you need to do
a base is a free website that's it you
click on the store you shop like normal
and then you get a cashback percentage
of your purchases into your Ebates
account so you just get money back for
buying which you were gonna buy in the
first place I made I think it's
incredible I've been using Ebates for
years I've been recommending them for
years so I am so excited that they are
sponsoring today's video and they wanted
to work with me it just makes me so
excited I can't even tell you so I will
have my link it to Ebates
down below if you are not yet signed up
like I said it is a free website there's
nothing else you need to do there's no
other hoops that you need to jump
through or anything like that it's just
super simple super straightforward and
then you get money back every three
months you can either a sign up to get a
check in the mail or get the money
credited to your PayPal account which
personally that is what I do and I am
awaiting my big fat check which is
coming in February and it's a lot
sometimes it's a base it's like you get
so much back you're like yeah awesome
well I shopped a lot then it didn't I
yes I sure did so I will have that link
it down below you also do get a $10
signup bonus if you sign up with the
link and then after you would make your
first a 25 dollar purchase through
Ebates you would get a $10 welcome bonus
credited to your account so it's super
easy to use like I said I've been using
Ebates at for years and I'm really
excited to partner with them on this
video I did make my purchases through
Sephora and Ulta and I got cash back at
both websites a lot
times they offer stuff like double
cashback like I've seen Sephora and also
go up to like 8% 10% cashback which is
crazy whether I see that I get so
excited but they have so many other
retailers there they're the largest
cashback website I just made a purchase
for my mom the other day from her
birthday from Target and I got cash back
before that one as well what just
fantastic so if you haven't checked out
you veyts yet I highly recommend that
you do they're also having a double
cashback in preparation of our
Valentine's Day so a bunch of stores are
gonna have a double cashback as well so
just any time that you're gonna purchase
online just make sure you go to Ebates
first such an easy way to get cash back
off of your purchases that you're going
to make anyways so I think that it's
really amazing
and like I said I did purchase of both
of through Sephora and ultimate for
these purchases that I made today and
it's just really helpful especially for
me right now in my situation to be able
to get a little bit of a kickback on
some of the purchases that I was making
so make sure to check that out also
Ebates is doing a giveaway with me which
has me even more excited I am going to

information will be down there the only
thing that you must be doing is having

giveaway and one winner will get a $100
gift card but if you are ready to see
what I've recently picked up from
Sephora and Ulta why don't I go ahead
and get started I will say that this is
not going to be the biggest haul you've
ever seen in your life of you guys know
I've been talking about it my husband
did lose his job about two weeks ago I'm
keeping a bit of a firmer hold it to my
budget right now so I'm kind of limited
to either gift cards or my Ulta points
and that's exactly what I did I cashed
in some Ulta points for these products
and I did actually have two Sephora gift
cards from the holiday time actually
that I've just been hanging on to and
that's what I made my purchases with
with these guys and then again use my
you guys got my cash back which is
fantastic so from Ulta I was really
excited to get this because I saw a mini
guy of it and I thought it'd be a good
way to try it out because it's a bit of
a more expensive product this is the
Smashbox photo-finish a primer Iser
so I was talking about this I think it
was in my Sephora lovelace video and I
said that I really wanted to try this
guy out but I think the full size is
like $42
which is pretty pricey so I saw the mini
which I think it's like $15 was when I
paid for this one I didn't think was a
bad price and it's a nice way to be able
to try it out and honestly it I mean
it's a decent sized sample especially
like for a primer I'll probably be able
to get several uses out of this one so
I'm excited to try it out it says that's
a primer in moisturizer in one and that
also has hyaluronic acid which is super
good for hydrating and giving moisture
back to your skin so I'm really excited
about this one a lot of people
recommended it when I put it in my
sephora loves list I had a couple
different primers on there and I felt
like that was the one that everybody was
talking about so especially when I saw
the mini pop-up I was like okay the mini
I'm gonna get you and then the next item
that I purchased is from dose of colors
one of my favorite brands and this is
their new lip gloss I mentioned this in
I will i buy it video and I said I
really did want to purchase one of the
lip glosses so I thought since I could
cash it in at some of my points I would
go ahead and grab it because it is
seventeen dollars which I do think is
pricey for a lip gloss but I still
wanted to try it out I got the shade
honey I'm home so let's see here I just
got my Ulta package in the mail so I
have not been able to play with anything
yet so here is what the lip gloss looks
like I actually do have a dose of colors
liquid lipstick on today but this one
was like a beige nude I think is how it
was described whoo that looks really
nice and these do look very pigmented
kind of like not just my top today so
there is what honey I'm home it looks
like so I'm excited to try these out I
like a lot of products from dose of
colors so I wanted to give their lip
glosses a try and then the final item
that I picked up from Ulta is from a
flower beauty I have been so excited
that flower beauty is coming into Ulta
and I feel like everybody has
recommended this highlight palette to me
it's called the shimmer and strobe
highlighting a palette and this was
$15.99 I believe it so you just have
three different highlight shades in
there if you can see it it's a nice and
sunny day today so you have three
different highlight shades in there and
then it also does come with an
applicator which I probably won't use it
just to be honest but I'm very excited I
love our Beauty one of my favorite
brands I was so pumped seeing them come
in to Ulta not everything that I had my
eye on has come into Alta yet I hope a
few more items pop up like the sponge
and I really want the contour palette
mind that shot
I do want to repurchase that one but I
feel like so many people have
recommended this highlight palette and I
loved the highlight that was in my face
palette from flower beauty so I am so
excited to pick this up but those were
the three items that I picked up from
alpha and then moving over to a Sephora
I had to get this one I had to this is
from Allah and Rickson if support
balance a facial asana scrub I did try
out a mini of this guy and just like
absolutely raved about it I loved that
one of so much so I really wanted to
pick up a full size of it this one I
believe it was $28 it says it exfoliates
date with purifies pores with volcanic
sand green fusion complex neem seed oil
and 8h a s it's super cool because when
you first put it on your face it's
really warm and like kind of tingly and
then I leave it sit I usually do this in
the shower I'll leave it sit while like
I conditioned my hair and whatnot and
then when I go to rinse it off it's
actually really cooling on the skin I
really enjoy this guy and yeah I ran out
of my sample and I knew I had to get a
full size then I got to two lip products
from a Sephora this first one here is
one of the Sephora lip stains floral lip
creme creme lip stain that's what it is
I also mentioned this into my Sephora
loves this video and so many people have
said like these are so underrated
everybody needs to try these they're so
good I think there are like $14 I want
to say it was and I picked up the shade
I think it's called pink tea it says
it's number 40 I'm pretty sure this was
called pink tea but I will have of
course everything will be listed down
below but I'm so excited to try these
especially since putting it in my video
and so many people said how amazing they
were so there is the swatch of pink tea
from the Sephora collection and then the
other lipstick I just really wanted to
try this I've been curious about them
this is from a venti beauty and it's one
of the new matte Moi's Elle lipsticks
and I got the shade up to no good
honestly it was between this one and
spanked but like I just I have this
thing where I lead towards lipsticks
that have really inappropriate names my
favorite lipstick from Mac at the moment
is called age sex location so I'm like I
can't have age sex location and spanked
at the same time like it just no let's
do up to no good I watched a bunch of
like swatch videos and such and tried to
pick out the shade that I thought would
work the best for me
so here's what the packaging Oh looks
like super cool super reflective I
believe these for $18 I want to say they
were and this is what it looks like and
then it has FB kind of stamped into the
actual lip product so let me go ahead
and swatch it okay I don't know if this
is quite what I was expecting but there
is up to no good it has a bit of like
orange undertone to it I would say it's
like a nude nude nude beige maybe it's
how I would describe that one I will
have to see how I like it on my lips but
I've just been really curious about
these and I've been hearing more and
more people chat about them so I thought
that I could give her a try so has
anybody tried at the Fendi beauty and
matte Mosel lipsticks yet and what do
you think about it but that was
everything that I purchase from Sephora
I actually didn't even use my full
amount that I had in gift cards but I'm
kind of that weird person when I have
gift cards like I just like I hang on to
them for a really long time and I'm I
feel like I'm worried like I was gonna
spend all of my gift card and then
something was gonna come out that I
really want and I would feel like too
guilty buying it so I only purchase a
few things that I've like really had my
eye on I really wanted to purchase and
then I'm still keeping some of my other
gift card amount for in case like that
next big thing comes out and I just
absolutely have to have it so those are
the items that I picked up from Sephora
again not the biggest haul in the world
but I think a lot of you guys understand
why that is right now but I'd still been
eyeing these products that for a really
long time between at Sephora and Ulta
and I really wanted to pick them up so I
hope that you guys enjoyed seeing this
new makeup haul for me so that is gonna
do it for today's video and at my makeup
haul from a Sephora and Ulta I hope that
you guys enjoyed seeing some of the
products of that I really wanted to pick
