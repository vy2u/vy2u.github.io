today's video I'm really excited to do
because it's going to be different for
my channel I'm going to be doing a
makeup tutorial here but I'm going to be
recreating a look that I have seen
another youtuber do you guys know that
I've been asking it for like some
different video suggestions for what you
don't want to see on my channel right
now a lot of people have requested
tutorials but one thing about my
tutorials is that when I create a makeup
look I am typically always watching
someone else on YouTube and recreating
their makeup looks I say in a lot of my
videos that I don't find myself
artistically creative so when I look at
a palette a lot of times I struggle with
what colors to put together what to go
with and first I just don't know so I
create a lot of my looks based on other
YouTube tutorials so as I've been
getting requested to do more tutorials
on my channel I'm thinking but I copy
other people so what am I supposed to do
and then I thought well let's just do
that so today's video I want to recreate
a makeup look that I saw Babs Beauty do
here on YouTube I thought it was
absolutely gorgeous and when I saw her
do it I was like I want to recreate that
look - I've talked about Babs Beauty
before on my channel she is probably the
number one youtuber that I could
recreate makeup looks with she does a
ton of tutorials on her channel and I
just found them all so beautiful so
about one week ago as she posted a full
face affordable makeup Valentine's Day
tutorial so I'll play a little bit here
from her look so you can see what she
did
so I just thought it was really
beautiful she did do a full face in
there but I'm mostly just gonna focus
this on the eyes I think I'm also gonna
do my highlight and my lip here on
camera but I also was really excited
because as she used this palette from a
dubious place it's the juice or the
juice a palette I've heard people
pronounce it both ways but I thought
this palette was so gorgeous and when
she did that look I was like this makes
me want this palette even more and I
actually got such a surprise when my
friend Makua sent me this one and also
the siharan palette from dubious place
I've been talking about how I want more
dubious place palettes and she sent me
two of them and I was just so I was so
caught off guard and grateful and so
excited and then when I opened this one
up and I saw all of its beauty I was
like I can recreate that tutorial from
Babs Beauty now so that's what I'm
really doing it today and a big big
thank you to Mike weecha for sending me
these palettes I'm so excited to play
with these I hope this pilot is just so
beautiful but this is one too that I
would look at it and be like what am I
supposed to do with these shades because
they're just kind of they're just kind
of I don't know their own little unique
thing like Juvia spice I feel like it's
known for so that's what we're gonna be
doing today and I'm excited I will have
a baddest beauty tutorial linked it down
below of course so you can see kind of
how I followed along and yeah other than
that if you want to see me recreating a
makeup look why don't we go ahead and
get started okay so we are nice and
zoomed ending policy all of the lovely
dry patches on my face I got really cold
again here which I'm super bummed about
but it's okay because they can't be
winter forever right right jumping into
the palette which I just think is so
beautiful so the first shade that she
picked up is this pink one
right here I think it's called creme and
she just used a fluffy brush I'm
obviously gonna be using my own brushes
and such but she used a fluffy brush and
she put this one into her crease like I
said I do have most of my face makeup
done and then I do also have my eyes
primed and set them with a powder so I'm
just gonna go ahead and work this into
my crease but yeah I was thinking about
this video because when so many people
were saying like do more tutorials and
things like that
was like okay you know and I did a
throwback Thursday tutorial which was
like a super simple I look I did the
using all the shades in a palette
challenge video and I was like okay but
I'm thinking about actual tutorials I'm
like I just feel really weird because I
recreate from other tutorials so much so
I would feel really weird going on
YouTube and being like I'm gonna show
you this look but actually it's not my
look I copied it from someone else but
then I thought well maybe that could
make like an interesting video and you
guys can kind of see how I follow along
if I can follow along with other
youtuber tutorials but I really like her
personally miss Stephanie Babs Beauty I
really do like her tutorials because
even though sometimes she does more
complicated makeup looks I still feel
like I can follow along pretty easily so
like I said I think she's the number one
youtuber I would say that I recreate her
makeup looks from I just find her
tutorials easy to follow and I think
she's beautiful she's a Midwestern girl
like me so I just really enjoy it but
when I saw this look and then I got the
palette from Alisha I was like no way
this is so oh my gosh I was so I have
been so overwhelmed with love I mean it
like in the best way these past couple
weeks it's been so crazy so thank you
everybody who's said something or
written something in like it's wildly
appreciated but next she came into this
middle shade called custard which is
kind of like a bright purple and I'm
gonna take a smaller brush because this
is where she kind of starts to create a
halo eye effect this is from Real
Techniques and it is the essential
crease brush so it's a little bit
smaller so I'm gonna pick that up and
she started to put this on the outer
part of her eye and then she also puts
it in the inner corner as to start the
halo live I thought I'm trying to do
like actually inserting like her video
clips you can see them but hey I have no
idea how people do that should I have no
idea how people get someone else's video
no clue about that but then also I don't
know how I feel about it also
because I just again had this happened
to me this is now the third time that
another YouTube channel pops up and they
steal all of my videos and repost them
so I had once again reach out to YouTube
to have them shut the channel down which
is so annoying so I mean not that that's
you know that's not my intention
obviously to like straight up pirates
someone but I would rather just say you
know I'll link her video down below and
have you guys go watch it versus like
watching the majority of it on my
channel I don't know how I don't know I
guess that kind of made me feel weird
and then I was like well regardless I
don't even know how to do that so I'll
just have a video link down below I'm
also gonna take that shade and put it
right in this inner part of my eye it is
really really pretty
both shades so far that I beat so far
are really really pretty so excited to
try out more Julius place and I have
just been some Laquisha sent me this one
and this is a Horan palette and then
Tammy actually sent me to our eyeshadow
palette and two blush palette I have one
of the blush shades on today from I
can't remember which palette was that I
use it's the volume 2 palette I think it
was I used a blush that are there today
it was like oh my gosh I've been saying
how I want more dubious place I've only
tried The Masquerade mini so far and now
I all of a sudden got four eyeshadow
palettes and two blush palette I'm like
you guys have blown my mind with the
amount of generosity and kindness as we
go through this like weird thing sort of
why I have this weird transition and
that were on so I just can't even say
how much I appreciate it I was talking
about I'm gonna snapchat last night I
was like I feel like I'm just such a
broken record and I'm constantly like
thank you and just like I wish I could
do something bigger but I don't know
what it is I'm supposed to do but it's
just it's just been such a such a crazy
time and the support from people from
all over it really it really it really
does something who really makes you feel
a certain way and you know I always say
like you know there's a lot of
negativity that comes along with social
media and putting yourself out there but
there's also a tremendous amount of good
that just cannot get looked over it
cannot get
Dober so they so then if she came into
this bottom of shade down here which is
called crepes I think as I say it and
I'm just gonna use the same brush from
her she is the same brush as well and
she basically just did what she did with
the prior shade the custard shade so
she's putting it on the outer part of
the eye to deepen it up and then also
the inner part for the halo eyes so
since it's a deeper color it's not too
deep it's mostly just kind of worn but I
am just gonna take my time and slowly
build it up
really give these ideas of like layering
on these different shades and I just I
don't have that mindset so that's why I
love watching tutorials because they
give me so many new ideas I mean you
guys watch my or if you did watch my
using every shade in a palette video
like so many people are like I would
have done this and I would have done
that and I was like yeah I don't have
that mind I don't have that like this
would look better here I'm not good at
that sort of stuff so it was kind of
funny reading the the comments I'm
actually filming this on Sunday so I
just post up the video like three hours
ago
but it's been funny reading the comments
like I would have done this and I was
going to put that there I'm like yo
that's why I struggled with the door yo
that's why I watch so many other
tutorials because I just don't have that
that clicks in my mind at all I picked
up Chocolat here in the top row I'm just
gonna use the same brush II did switch
brushes at this point but I'm just gonna
keep using it the same one and she did
the same thing that she's been doing is
putting it on the outer part the iron
and also the inner part of the eye and
still building up the halo effect and
she did say I kind of liked hearing her
say that dark shadows intimidate her too
because dark shadows definitely
intimidate me it was kind of like
refreshing to hear someone who like
clearly has amazing makeup skills say
that dark shadows still intimidate her
so she said to go light hand it and work
it up and then also her other tip was
when working with darker shadows to keep
them low on the eyes so as I wanted to
stick with this brush because I still
feel like it's pretty small so I'm just
going to work that shade out here and
then on the inner part of the ayah I
think the effects that the shade is
having is really really cool what does I
look well this next part I'm pretty
nervous for because she did a cut crease
with concealer and I have only tried
this one time as of recently so I'm
pretty I'm pretty nervous about this
part but I mean used the color pop no
filter concealer because my shade is in
light like neutral and it's way too
darker it's way too light for me as a
concealer so when I tried
crease a couple weeks ago this is the
concealer that I chose for it so I'm
going to do again I'm gonna pick up the
shader lid brush from sigma and a 56 and
I'm just gonna take some onto the brush
here and attempt it kind of nervous
about this so what she did is she put it
in the center of her lip first like this
I think and then kind of moved it around
a little bit I think it was something
like that but you see I like messed up
right there so I'll have to try to
figure out how to fix that
so that is what I have with the
concealer I don't know if that's right
but doesn't work we're gonna roll with
it and then the shades that should put
on top of the concealer she mixed these
two shades right here which are tart and
puffs so I'm gonna go ahead and do that
and I'm using a motive brush or a shader
brush she didn't mention in the video I
don't think she did if she sprayed her
brush or not but I typically always
spray at my brush with a just a setting
spray to make my brush damp so I did
that and then I'm just gonna pack well
those are really pretty I'm gonna pop
those right on top of the concealer that
makes a really pretty shade Wow
I am loving this center shade that is so
gorgeous
you guys have any other ideas for me for
tutorial style videos I know I've seen
some people recommend the palette bingo
which I've seen Lauren my beauty believe
it is that she does a lot of palette
bingo so those are fun so I put those on
my list but if you have any other
tutorial style videos ish you know what
I'm saying
I don't really like to say that I'm ever
doing a tutorial but if you have any
other video suggestions like this or if
you'd like to see me recreate more
makeup looks and there's somebody in
particular or a video in particular you
would want to see please let me know in
the comments and then she went back in
with this deeper shade up here and said
that she kind of blurred the lines from
the cut crease that we did so I'm just
gonna grab a little bit more of that
product still using that same Real
Techniques brush and I'm just gonna kind
of lightly sweep on the outer part and
then also the inner part of the eye to
help it look more blended so my camera
actually died as I was blending it
overheated and died and I was so
intensely focused on blending I didn't
even notice but I did put on the lashes
that she used in her video as well and
they're the morphe hypnotic lashes for
the lower lash line
she used the dark chocolate shade and
then also this warmer shade down
here and she put those on the lash line
I'm gonna use the Sigma flat definer
brush it's an e 15 so first I'm gonna go
in with a warmer shade it looked like
she used a flat definer as well so I'm
also gonna pick up the darker shade and
smudge that as well okay and then I
believe that's all that she did for the
eyes but I thought I could do the
highlights too because as she used the
flower Beauty highlight palette and she
used the center pink shade right here
and I just picked this up and just
featured it in my latest haul so when I
saw that she used that I was like I kind
of want to highlight with that as well
so I'm gonna use that - ooh that is
really pretty so many people said that
they absolutely loved this highlight
palette so I had to get it once they
came available at Ulta and it's a really
nice pink so it goes well with this
Valentine's Day look I think that
highlight is like way stunning but she
also came back into the palette and she
used a little bit of part as a highlight
as well she said it has a bit of like a
dual chrome and s to it so she just
layered that on top of the flower Beauty
highlight gonna be glowing today like I
said I'm filming on Sunday so it's Super
Bowl Sunday so hope my friends really
enjoyed my makeup today this screams a
Super Bowl party I know it does and then
for her lip color I really can't find
anything that I thought was going to be
exactly like the one she used if she
used one from flower beauty but I pulled
out this one from a ciaté London it's
one of their liquid Velvets in a
bittersweet because this one I feel like
if I'm remembering correctly has a bit
of a grayish tone to it she had a really
deep kind of grayish color but I'm just
gonna go ahead and use this water
like her lip color was definitely darker
than this one but it's like it's kind of
us a sort of vibes ish and then she also
did top it with a lip gloss I don't have
to look glossy used either but I'm just
gonna do I'm some buxom white Russian go
loss
after the lip color that is going to do
it I think I did a pretty good job of
recreating this makeup look I don't know
what do you guys think let me know in
the comments down below okay so that is
gonna do it for my video with recreating
a Babs beauty and makeup look I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
and seeing me recreate a look or what I
do I'm a pretty daily basis when I come
up with my makeup looks like I said I
will have her video linked down below I
hope that you will go check it out you
can see how I did and if you are new to
her channel I hope that you will let her
know that I'm sitting you over there
because like I said I just adore her
tutorials so much they're the ones that
I follow along with the most if you
would want to see more videos like this
in the future please adieu of course I
let me know I hope that you guys did
like this one but I thought it could be
fun to do on camera here everything that
I use will be linked in the description
box down below of course as well and ask
for the palette from dubious place I
really really liked that palette that
was so nice I did get a little bit of
follow under my eyes when I was packing
on the to shimmer shades to the center
of my lid but other than that that was
all I experienced for Fallout I feel
like they blend it really nice I feel
like they were really pigmented so I
really enjoyed that palette I'm excited
to use it more and again a big THANK YOU
to Makua for sending that to me because
I think it's gorgeous I love how this
makeup look came out I love being able
to recreate looks because I would not
have been able to think of this one on
my own it was challenging doing the cut
crease with the concealer I was a little
bit scared about it but I still really
enjoyed it and I had so much fun and
filming it for you guys so as always if
you guys did enjoy this video I hope
that you'll give it a thumbs up I hope
that you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I'll catch you guys in
at tomorrow's video right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
