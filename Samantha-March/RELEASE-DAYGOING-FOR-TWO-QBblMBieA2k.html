channel I just have a very quick video
to bring to you today some of my
favorite videos to do because that means
it is a release day for marching inc
which is the publishing company that I
own today is the release of going for
two this is by Laura Chapman this is the
second book in her queen of the league
series the first book is a
first-and-goal right here I don't have
the print copy yet of going for two
because we are still waiting like the
proof copy so we can look over
everything and make sure it looks ok
I've said this before on my channel when
it comes to publishing books the print
book typically goes up a little bit
later than the e-book because it takes a
while for create space which is the
print on demand company we use it takes
them a little bit to create the book and
then ship us the book and then we have
to look at it we have to prove it and we
have to put it on sale takes a little
bit but today release day of going for
two it is for sale right now in ebook
form on amazon Kobo and barnes &amp;amp; noble
it is 299 and to celebrate the release
first and goal as an e-book is only 99
cents on amazon Kobo and barnes &amp;amp; noble
so if you have not read the first book
in the series we did put it on sale so
you guys can grab that and then also get
going for two our first and goal I can
leave my link to my video that I did on
that release day which I kind of give a
little bit more info to but obviously
since it's a part of the series going
for two is just following where
first-and-goal left off which we end up
giving away like spoilers and things
like that so I don't really want to say
a whole lot about the book except I
loved it especially if you're someone
who loves Chiclets but you also happen
to love football like this girl right
here and also Laura she's a Big Green
Bay Fan as well such as myself feel love
football as well this is a perfect
combination of football and Chiclets
don't worry I understand if you are not
a football girl you don't need to
understand or particularly like football
in order to get until these stories it's
just an added bonus if you are a
football fan I think it would make you
love them even more but there's a lot
going on and going for two once again
we have the funny scenes going on we
have the heartwarming scenes there's
some scenes that will leave you kind of
like know what's going to happen next
the ending is a lot of fun i love how
she ended it because now i can't wait to
see what happens in the third book i'm
so excited that should be coming out
later this year in 2016 but yes today
release day going 42 by Laura Chapman
I'm so proud of her I'm so proud of this
book I think you guys will love it I
will leave all the links to buy the book
