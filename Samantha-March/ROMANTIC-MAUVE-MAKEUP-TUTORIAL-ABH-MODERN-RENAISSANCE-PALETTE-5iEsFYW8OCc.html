today's video is going to be a new
makeup tutorial on this kind of like
romantic mob oh look I'm going to be
using the Anastasia Beverly Hills a
modern renaissance palette for this eye
look and this was actually a look that I
did while we were traveling for
Christmas it was just one of the looks
that I came up with one morning I think
was actually Christmas day that I did
this look and I was totally inspired by
this top I had just bought in this top
and I had it on trying to think of what
makeup to do and I was like I want to do
makeup like my shirt that's what I
wanted so that's how I came up with this
novelist because I'm totally obsessed
with this color right now if you're
wondering this top is from top love
clothing that is the clothing boutique
that I work for that was started by my
sister-in-law Steph and I now do online
sales and marketing for the store so of
course I will leave this link down below
but I'm obsessed with this color I know
we just got another one in a shade like
I bought a sweater also around the same
Christmas time and gray and I absolutely
love it we just got that one in in this
mauve color as well and I need it also
the bralette is from top-left also but I
was totally inspired by this makeup look
because of the shirt so that is what we
are doing today I really hope that you
guys enjoy this tutorial I love the way
it turned out again I'm just obsessed
with this look right now I use a new
highlighter and I'm very excited to
share with you as well but if you would
like to see how I got this a mauve
makeup look inspired by my shirt please
keep watching okay so starting off with
the eyes using the modern renaissance
palette from Anastasia I do have my eyes
primed and ready for some shadows so
first I'm going to come into raw Sienna
and use my morphe m4 for one brush and
just lightly apply this into the crease
as my transition color and for my
transition colors I like to hold the
brush at the very end and just use light
pressure to apply this shade you use my
morphe m4 3-3 and go into a love-letter
which is this beautiful pink right here
and I'm going to apply this on the outer
corner so I'm first going
to place my brush down right in the
outer corner and then just run it in
circular motions and really get the
majority of the product right on this
outer part of my eye and then as most of
the product is there I'll do a little
bit of blending across the eye
my main focus is going to be right here
on the outer part of the eye and just
making sure that it's nice and blended
don't worry about going too far out are
too far out because you can always come
in later clean it up with eyeshadows or
even concealer so I don't worry too much
about being super precise here I don't
have a ton of little base to work with
like I just simply don't so for me it's
usually gets messy because of my limited
lip space and then I'm going to use my
morphe g13 and pick up the shade antique
bronze and I'm going to apply this into
the center part of my lid so again first
I'm just going to Pat the product on to
the center parts really make sure most
of it gets right there and then I'll
slowly also blend it the merge of those
two shades I like this brush because I
find it kind of unique I don't really
have anything else like it in my
collection it's good for placing shadows
but it also is like fluffy enough that
it's nice to blend so I reach for this
one quite a bit so again the main focus
of this shadow is going to be right on
the center of the eye I'm gonna come in
with no extra product on my blending
brush and just once again just sweep
everything through picking up my Sigma E
54 I'm gonna grab just a little bit of
this bon fresco shade and just lightly
tap this into the very inner corner of
my eye I don't want to get too crazy
with this shade because it is like a
really soft lilac like it's not so much
mob but I just wanted a little something
and I didn't want too much shimmer like
a lot of times I
the gold shimmer like I would put
Primavera or Vermeer into that inner
corner I didn't want to do something
with shimmer but I still wanted
something light so that's why I went
with that shade so just tap ever so
slightly I mean you can totally skip
this step but I just liked it then
grabbing my g13 and once again just
blending through everything so I feel
like it just gave it like a little bit
of a pop again totally stuff that you
can skip but I like the way that it
turned out I was talking about messy
shadows like you can see I have pretty
messy shadows one thing I'll do I can do
it with a concealer you can clean it up
or another trick that I like to use like
I would just come into the first shade
here in the palette tempura I'm
describing any old brush will work but
it's just a white shade and I basically
just use that shadow to clean up the
shadows like super easy super simple but
I do this trick quite a bit and I mean
you can do it up top too as well to
clean up or you can clean up with like a
highlight shade for your brow bone
whatever you want to do but I just
thought I'd share it with you I didn't
once in an Instagram tutorial I left
this part in and showed how I cleaned up
the shadows and I actually have a lot of
comments on it so I thought I would do
it in this video as well but yeah super
easy or you can totally use concealer up
to you but I just thought it would be
fun to show you guys but go for liner
I'm gonna use the Sigma wicked gel liner
and I'm gonna use the small angle e65
from Sigma this is a bigger winged liner
brush than I normally use I usually used
the eo6 but I wanted to do something
you'd be a little bit bigger this was
actually my first winged liner brush and
I've been wanting to go back to it so
that's what I'm gonna do and we're gonna
see how it turns out so funny it just
feels like it's so much bigger than the
eo6 but now I'm nervous why I decide to
do this the time I'm on camera I have no
idea but but we're gonna see
I so for my winged liner I always draw
my line across first and then I do the
wing and like I just couldn't do it I
have to go to my ego 6 look how tiny
this brush is like I have to do this for
my wing
I was trying like I was preparing myself
to do the wing and I was like I can't do
it this brush is so huge like that's
what I always use for my winged liner
but for some reason after using this
elos 6 I'm like I just I couldn't do a
brush that big so I'm gonna take my
little brush now and create the wing
that was weird I didn't know that was
gonna happen
so for my liner I just followed the
eyeshadow line that I created from
cleaning up the shadows I just followed
that line drug it back and then now all
I'm doing is simply filling it in
okay so I'm gonna switch to my Facebook
quick a so for primer I'm gonna use the
Too Faced primed and poreless Illinois
first primers I ever bought I probably
could have mentioned it in my YouTube
didn't make me buy a video if you guys
haven't seen that I hope you'll check it
out I recently posted about makeup that
YouTube didn't to convince me to buy
like the untyped makeup this definitely
would have fallen into that category as
well because I started purchasing this
purchasing at the premium poreless
primer like so long ago her foundation
I'm going to use the Anastasia Beverly
Hills a stick foundation I am in the
shade natural but what I do is just make
some stripes along my face nothing crazy
nothing fancy and then I'm gonna blend
that out with my Sigma f80 brush been
liking this foundation more when I first
got it I was like yeah it's okay but I
felt like a lot of people were like
going crazy over it and I didn't
immediately like fall in love but it's
been growing on me I definitely say to
blend it in with a brush not a Beauty
Blender because to me it's like light
medium coverage and if you use a Beauty
Blender like it's just way too light of
coverage unless that's what you want of
course and then for concealer I'm going
to use the heart-shaped tape of course I
am so I'm just going to apply this on my
under eyes and then the center of my
face as well
then I'm going to use my Sigma F 79 to
blend that in the concealer is really
good too to clean up I shadow so if you
still need to or you can use it to clean
up your liner even in case your liner
got away from you I'll use that trick
fairly often as well who set the
concealer and bake I'm using the Kat Von
D brightening powder I have my shade in
Peach just using a slightly damp Real
Techniques sponge to apply it
I just applied this to my undereyes I
know some people like to bake a lot of
places especially with this peach
brightening powder I just really like it
for my under eyes I think it sets
concealer well but I also do think it
brightens up the face so that's
typically just where I'll put my
brightening powder this foundation does
have a little bit of a layer coverage
typically when I use a Nastasia I like
to go in as well with my Maybelline
butter skin skin transforming powder oh
it just looks like this I just take the
little sponge with it I think it works
just fine
and I'm just going to set that on the
rest of my face I just like it because
it gives a little bit more umph a little
bit more coverage and I also think this
foundation does a really good job of
making everything look airbrushed which
I think the lack of brightening powder
does as well so I like to use these
together I just think it helps tie
everything together really well and then
to dust off the excess powder I'm using
my morphe e3 to dust everything away and
then two bras I'm going to go into the
bronze of Champions it's a little like
sample box from a benefit but it has the
hoola bronzer inside and I love this
little bronzer so this is what I'm going
to use to bronze up the face I didn't
want to do any cream contouring today I
don't know why you know I'm just having
one of those days but definitely if you
want to cream contour or anything like
that you go right ahead but just wasn't
what I was feeling today I also
mentioned this box in my YouTube didn't
make me buy a video and I love this guy
especially like I bring it out the most
for the hoola bronzer because you can't
take the bronzer out but I think it's a
really great bronzer i'm using the
morphe m5 3-0 like usual so a couple
things I'm gonna do off the camera just
in the interest of saving time I'm gonna
fill in my brows using the benefit goof
proof pencil I'm also gonna put summer
lashes on these are the huda beauty
lashes in Samantha so I'm gonna pop
these on as well and then I'll be back
to finish off the look okay I'm gonna go
back and finish off the eyes so in my
waterline I'm going to use this color
pop gel liner and this is
in cry-baby so it's a really light
lavender shade it kind of reminds me of
the bon fresco from the palette actually
I've been wearing this a lot lately and
I get a lot of comments on Instagram
saying like I really like that white
liner in your eyes the white liner makes
your eyes pop and it's actually always
been crybaby so just so you know it's
actually a lavender shade but I love it
color pop gel liners are like hands-down
my favorite so I'm just gonna play this
in the waterline
and then for the lower lashline I'm of
course taking my morphe 36 I'm actually
gonna pick up Venetian red it reminds me
a lot of love letter it just has more of
a red tone to it and it also has just
like a hint hint of shimmer but I'm
going to place this on the lower lash
line but this one I'm being kind of like
I'm trying to make it closer to my lash
line instead of like getting really
crazy and smudging it out I'm keeping
this one close to the lash line you
could definitely use like a flat definer
brush for this as well I just am
obsessed with my morphe 36
to offset that I'm going to use a little
bit of burnt orange as well this is like
one of my favorite shades ever still
using my morphe 36 sometimes if you use
like red or Pink's a lot or especially
in the lower lash line it can make you
look kind of sick like your eyes are
like red-rimmed so usually if I do that
I come in with another color as well
this one I'm being a little bit more
sloppy and just blending this one out as
well and I'm also going to take just a
little bit of antique bronze and I'm
going to focus this one in the middle of
the lower lash line and then towards the
inner corner instead of sweeping it all
the way through I'm just gonna focus
this one on that area my bottom lashes
I'm just going to use a little bit of a
Smashbox x-rated mascara
I blush I'm gonna use a between the
sheets from colour-pop and my morphe m42
7 I like this one it's just a light kind
of pinkish blush so I thought it would
match this look pretty well so for
highlight I want to try something new
it's gonna be my first time trying it if
you watch my beautycon unboxing these
are both items in here but I'm so
excited to use this this is a artist
Couture diamond glow powder in
Illuminati so excited and then also in
the box came the luxe e52 2 tapered
highlighter brush so I'm finally going
to use these and I'm so excited I hear
so many good things about the diamond
glow powder so I'm excited to test it
for myself so it is like a loose
highlighter so what I've seen people do
is just like kind of spray their brushes
so I'm gonna spray my brush with the mac
fix+ so I'm just gonna apply this to
tops of my cheekbones oh I hope the
camera is picking that whole whole thing
I was picking that up hope the camera is
picking that up whoa that is so pretty
oh whoa wow that is super pretty
that's way pretty mm okay and I'm just
gonna take some down Center my nose tip
of my nose Cupid's bow like normal Oh
Dobie okay so that's the diamond glow
powder in Illuminati not mad not bad
right now yeah if you guys just want to
like glow to the gods I feel like this
is a pretty darn good highlighter for
that hmm BAM okay so to finish it off we
need a lipstick of course so this is
hooter beauty's bombshell I love who
does lipsticks so much I mentioned them
at my best a beauty video I'm giving
away a set in my best of beauty giveaway
video I just freaking love this and I
think it matches this look so well
but once I have the lip on I'm just
gonna spray my face with a bit of mac
fix+ and then this look is complete if
those gonna finish up the look what did
you think I hope that you enjoyed it as
much as I enjoyed putting it together
for the second time I was really happy
to film this tutorial because when I did
this look on Christmas I just absolutely
fell in love with it and it's been one
that I've been wanting to film for so
long I apologize my lighting of course
is probably not the best I feel like I
say that in so many of my videos but I
don't like filming tutorials when
there's not sunshine and I have to use
my light because I just I don't think it
looks as good but we have had no
sunshine in a lot of days which makes me
super sad I hate when there's no Sun
like I don't even mind if it's 2 degrees
but if it's sunny outside at least
there's sunshine to boost my mood but we
haven't seen the Sun in a while so total
bummer but I apologize if my lighting
was a little bit crazy but you know
something I'm working on in 2017 is to
get better lighting and more lighting
but I hope that you guys still enjoyed
this look I was like shocked at the way
that high light came out I don't know
you probably saw my face I can't wait to
watch the footage back and look at my
expression when I put the highlight on
so I hope that you guys liked it I hope
that you enjoyed this look kind of like
a romantic mauve type of look I don't
know I love it so I hope that you guys
do as well of course all of the products
brushes everything that I use will be
linked in the description box down below
let me know what you guys want to see it
for my next a makeup tutorial I know
I've been seeing a lot of like bolder
looks being requested so put that on the
list it's just not something I feel like
I'm great at but I can sure give it a
shot you guys just for you but I guess
I'd hope that you guys enjoyed this
