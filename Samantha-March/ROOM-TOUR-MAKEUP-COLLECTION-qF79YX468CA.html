today's video is this going to be a
little informal bonus video I'm going to
do a quick office tour you can see areas
already is wondering what I'm doing I
did recently repaint my office that you
set the dark red walls if you remember
we did some repainting and I did some
switching around with my makeup
collection and such and I was getting a
lot of requests to film a room tour so
that's what we're doing today so this is
my office it does have doors which are
so helpful this office is definitely one
of the things that sold us on this house
because having a first-floor office is
just so helpful I'm close to the kitchen
I'm close to the living room and I don't
feel like I'm kind of you know
sequestered upstairs in that bedroom
turned office so I love my office so
much this is where I spend basically all
day and typically most nights it has
this nice big window over here which is
also really helpful because I just sit
right here in the middle of the room
face the window and that's how I film
and I love filming with natural lighting
so when you walk in if you come over to
this side I do have a ring light that I
just kind of store behind the door here
in case I need it on you know dark days
or if I'm filming later in the day and
then this is Aries and her bench I
really like the bench I think we got it
from t.j.maxx a couple years ago but I
like it because it does actually open up
show him how you stretch a girl goodness
I like it because it opens up and we can
put some storage in there which i think
is really awesome but it's mostly for
for Aries this is also for Aries that's
her cave she loves going in there so
this is my bookshelf in the corner here
we didn't move this from where it was
before we did the repainting on the top
is my flowers that's my bridal bouquet
from my wedding I have really bad
allergies so we weren't able to use real
flowers so everything was fake but that
means that I got to keep everything and
then also that is the wedding photo of
my grandparents and actually I can show
you it's on my wedding bouquet I thought
that would be really special neither of
them are with us anymore oh man oh man
so this is where you see my addiction to
sheet masks I have just like piles and
piles and piles of sheet masks yeah true
story I also have like my hair bands for
skin care a lot of times I'll set my
beauty blenders up here dirty or clean
that's kind of where they go because
areas like see Beauty blenders so I put
them on the top shelf second shelf has
my makeup brushes so kind of how I
organize my makeup brushes my mom got
this for me I think it was from original
beauty box I believe but I have kind of
my bigger brushes in here I kind of sort
them by like foundation brushes and then
in here is like bronzer contour brushes
concealer brushes and then in here is
like blush and highlight brushes and
then these are my eye brushes and I
separate them by blending brushes and
then you know more like flat shader
shadow brushes and these are the kind of
more detailed smaller brushes pencil
brushes lower lash shadows eyebrow inner
corner you know things like that so
those are some of my brushes and then
moving it down to this section right
here so I don't have everything even all
back in my office yet from the remodel
it definitely took a very very long time
and you guys should thank Mitch a lot in
the comments because he did the majority
of the painting I didn't really know
what I was doing so it was mostly him
and then I'm still trying to figure out
where I want to put everything and get
everything back in here so it's not you
know quite perfect yet but my office is
usually extremely messy and I figure
while it's still somewhat clean I would
go ahead and film this video so I just
have a few random things on top P Becca
and Jaclyn hill face palette a primer
drawers here I have blushes and then
these ones here are primers that's kind
of how I
divvied up this section here those are
still all primers primers and these two
big ones are blushes and then in this
section here this front row I have all
of my concealers and
then this basket is full of eyeliners
and then also my mascaras and that is
sitting on another acrylic drawer on
here I have a couple of gel liners
because I wasn't sure where to put them
but then in this acrylic drawer I have
bunch of my MAC lipsticks and then in
the second drawer I have my morphe
lipsticks and then these are a bunch of
the Mac lip glosses and then also their
liquid lipsticks and then in the third
drawer is mostly next to liquid suede
and the lip launch arrays as well like
here I don't know how well you're going
to be able to see it but this is kind of
like my bronzer section and then next to
it is my highlighter section and then
down here on the next row Isis mostly
like eyebrow
stuff and I have my lash tweezers here I
have lash glue and then also in this
drawer I have like my eyelid primers and
then this drawer right here this has a
bunch of like my face palettes in there
and then in this the little guy is where
I have like my glitters I don't know if
you can see any of this because it's so
dark over here but I have my Stila
glitters in here and just a couple of
random products and then in here I have
a couple of new items like the Kat Von D
shade + light contour palette and then
also the anastacio cream contour kit and
then I have a mug here from my friend
Mickey it says all I need is coffee and
mascara I thought that was really cute
so this was kind of like old decor piece
and then down here is just kind of where
I put boxes of like new stuff that I
still have to go through or still have
to review I also do have some of my nail
polishes right here too like this is my
Ipsy bag that I just got in the other
day so that is everything that is on my
bookshelf and that is just in the corner
of my room so moving on I have this
little like clear three drawer over here
it used to be on the opposite side of my
desk and I moved it over to this side
after we repaint it I just have my phone
charger on here
this is a stack of all of my books if
you guys don't know I'm a published
author these are all of the books that I
have written so I just have a stack here
this is my most recent one it's called
defining her there's what she looks like
it's the back cover woohoo
my books are all available on Amazon and
they're always linked in all of my
YouTube description boxes and then this
here is a stack of books typically I am
also a book blogger I run the blog
chicklet plus.com
so I'm always reviewing books for
authors and I typically get ebooks
because they're just the most convenient
to read especially because I always have
to read so quickly but sometimes I do
get sent print copies or like sometimes
my friends will send me their books like
Lindsey is one of my friends and then
also where's Tess's book Tess
woods here those are two authors I would
definitely say to check out so I have
their print copies so I leave them here
for when I'm ready to read them and then
in the drawers here this one is let's
see I have all my setting sprays in here
these have kind of been moving around
since the remodel so I'm kind of like
what's olden days again I put all of my
setting sprays in here in this section
and then these over here I like powders
that's the maybelline powder than the
pixie powder the laura mercier secret
brightening powder like here I have a
couple of you know kind of like single
shadows or smaller palettes that I'm
really like not 100% sure what I'm doing
with yet so they're just kind of hanging
out back there until I get everything
figured out and then the second drawer
is my last drawer so I have you know all
of my pure lashes in here these are the
huda beauty Samantha lashes the blinking
buttes that I've been testing out
recently these are some from Nicole

some more skincare like I always have
makeup wipes in here I have some like
eye gels and things like that I have
more hair bands in this drawer more hair
bands more facial wipes that's kind of
like a miscellaneous
skincare type of drawer have in the
three drawer that looks kind of creepy
actually with Hutus eyes looking out at
me so moving on the like focal piece in
the office is definitely my desk it is
ginormous
I bought it four or five years ago maybe
and I think where I bought it from
I think it was like OfficeMax or
something like that but I bought it
quite a few years ago so on top here I
just have some foundations and this

number seven those are some foundations
this one in here I just have some
pallets I have some pure pallets soap
and glory the soon as the pilot boss
some little rock pallets and then these
are some little pellets like the
Maybelline City Mini and then when the
Smashbox cover shot pallets I think is
what they were called and then in this
one I love this little carrier here umm
I think all of these actually were sent
to me from my friend Mickey and this one
was sent from her too and I just love
it's a really big if you can tell it's a
really big eye shadow palette holder
which i think is really cool so I have
some taller eyeshadow pull ups in the
back like the Too Faced chocolate bonbon
and the sweet peach and then just some
more eye shadow palettes in here more
future life I've a and B these are the
pure vanity palettes that I love and

and then in this one I have some more
foundations make it forever to know my
stick foundations like hourglass put our

perfumes here Chloe this is defined me I
love this fragrance and this one - ooh

Kenzo perfume that I absolutely love and
then hiding back there is my Vita

always have to have it on hand and then
I'm moving on to this side I have to
brush books here this one is from Sigma
and this one is the teal brush book from
SL miss glam Beauty I have some palettes
just kind of randomly scattered over
here some makeup geek Sigma the Tarte
blush Brooke dose of colors again I I
don't know for sure 100% how everything
is going to end up once everything is in
here and how I'm good
organize it this is just what I kind of
have going for right now in this center
drawer I keep a lot of like my makeup
bags things like that and then over here
on this side I have more palettes in
here a Tarte palette this is the Chris
Anna an Olympus palette and the morphe
kathleenlights I have the subculture
sitting out
I have modern Renaissance the Tarte clay

don't know how well you'll be able to
see them all but these are all like my

morphe Jaclyn hill palette and then I
just have a couple of like random
brushes like brushes I don't use super
often but I still really like and

just have some like random items here
there's like hand creams and sanitizers
back there I have a little basket of
like chokers and stuff back there too
that's kind of like a miscellaneous
drawer I have my hair bands in there I

calendar here there's my laptop pen
holder this holds random things to hair

it's just like a breakdown of both me
and my husband's name and then over here
I have a bunch of lipsticks so on the
top here are a bunch of NYX matte

random ones and here and then in these
little drawers I kind of have like my

some Kat Von D lipsticks dose of colors
this one is from achieve on cheek for
the beauty this next row I have a lot of
drugstore to start with the wet and wild
these are all Maybelline and
these two are from tarts and then urban
decay this next year I have a bunch of
color pop christineanne cosmetics appear
number seven a NYX gloss yeah like I try
to keep it somewhat cohesive but again
when you're in the process every
organizing it can kind of feel a little
hard this is just all of my lip liners
bunch of lip liners and there and this
bottom drawer these milk lipsticks that
I just absolutely love some over
lipsticks Marc Jacobs lip gloss
this one is Marc Jacobs - this is
Burberry and then in here I thought this
was really cute that make you sent to me
and I was trying to figure out what I
wanted it for and I keep it over here
because I put products in that like I'm
trying like these are dull ones I'm
trying this milk lipstick I just love so
I keep it handy this is a glossier lip
balm I talked about it in my last makeup
monthly and I really enjoy it and I like
to have it out and usually I would just
scatter it all around my desk and it'd
be super confusing so I decided to put
that here and I can put those items
instead of cluttering my desk with them
I can put them in here so I thought that
would be pretty cool and then I have
more drawers and stuff like you know
pulled the style you're always gonna
find my kindle you always gonna find a
notebook because I have to write down
ideas and such a mirror my cute little
mouse pad here is where that three
drawer used to be but I decided to get
rid of it and back here I kind of hide
my tripod and then also my empties
garbage can for empties videos so that
is my desk and how I have it right now
and just you know she made her
appearance on camera earlier somehow she
needs to rest because that was
exhausting and then over here we have
the black desk so what I kind of have up
here with these acrylic drawers is new
makeup makeup I'm testing out you know
makeup I just want to make sure I'm
using because I want to review so that's
kind of just what's happening in here
with lipsticks I have a couple of base
products from Charlotte Tilbury that got
sent to me and here I have some new
products my friend Candace sent me the
smart Jacobs face palette also the
yesplease palette and a face palette
from Urban Decay the naked flushed
palette I
the two of the pier pellets the
eyeshadow palette and the contour
palette that sent to me from octoly some
new products here the tacho spray
foolproof the color pop her palette
which is really really good and then
same thing in here same concept I kind
of want to get another acrylic and use
it as like an everyday makeup drawer I
don't have like that Alex nine shelves
or whatever it is that everybody else
has so I don't know if I should put
another acrylic up here and use that I
haven't decided yet because again this
is all like newer items to me that I
still need to try some stuff from soap &amp;amp;
Glory
a Burberry highlight the elf foundation
this Lancome I can probably put in my
highlighter same with the Urban Decay I
can put those into my collection now
because I did review these but a bunch
of like new brow products these
maybelline liners that are new to me so
that's kind of what this area is
and then these two palettes are new to
me the morphe 35o two and then my friend
live from live loves her makeup semi B
Kat Von D st. and center there's a
packers pen lying out because you know
never know when you need a pen and then
kind of else over here this was also
from my friend and Mickey it also says
boss lady and I have a couple of newer
brushes to me so I just got some of
these brushes in here and then this is a
new Urban Decay eyeshadow and then I got
this man-eater set from Tarte so it's
sitting up here because I need to
remember to use it soon love that the
remodel also helped me just kind of
declutter and just get rid of stuff I
didn't need I love the I love the way
the walls came out I love the colors I
think it's just so much prettier than
what it used to be I don't feel like I'm
sitting in a cave for hours and hours
you know every single day just as so
much more it just is so much brighter
and cheerier and better for a creative
process you know I'm an author I'm in
the middle of writing my sixth novel and
I just feel like having a happy space
like this just truly does help me out
but that's just a quick little tour of
my room I mean it's nothing it's nothing
crazy but it's my office I'm really
proud of it I'm proud of my desk
I'm proud of my bookshelf I'm proud of
my collection
