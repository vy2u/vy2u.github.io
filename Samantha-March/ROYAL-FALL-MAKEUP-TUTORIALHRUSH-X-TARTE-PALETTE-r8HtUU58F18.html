today's video is going to be a makeup
tutorial and it's going to be using the
new styled by her uche palette in
collaboration with Tarte cosmetics so I
did a first impression and swatches on
this palette and I asked you guys if you
wanted to see a makeup tutorial on it a
little bit fall inspired since that's
the season that we're heading into and
so many of you said yes that's exactly
what I did if you did watch that first
video you know there's the color royal
in here it's a berry color that I was
very curious about I didn't like the way
it's watched so it was really nervous
about it so I wanted to incorporate it
into the tutorial so you guys could see
actually what it looks like on the eyes
so I really hope that you guys enjoy
this tutorial I seriously still do think
this palette amazing my first impression
of it was I thought it was awesome and I
thought everyone should get it and I
have used this palette so many different
times and I am still loving it so you
guys probably know I don't do tutorials
on YouTube a whole lot mostly because
I'm not a makeup artist I'm not really
that comfortable with my cup so I like
to keep doing reviews and first
impressions in halls but I have started
doing a lot of tutorials over on
instagrams I'm March beauty word over
there and I am posting a tutorial like
every other day almost and I've been
doing a lot with this palette as well so
if you want to see even more tutorials
with this or on any other makeup items
you can follow me over on Instagram
because I am doing quite a bit of
tutorials over there but I hope you guys
enjoy the look that I came up with today
it's crazy to think that we're heading
into fall if you want to see another
fall tutorial just let me know and maybe
I can do like one or two other fall
inspired looks as well you enjoy this
tutorial I hope you will give it a
thumbs up make sure you are subscribed
