how are you today hopefully quite well
today's video is going to be a tag video
so I wanted to do a new like bookish tag
video i just said the fall favorites tag
which was like mostly geared toward the
beauty side of the channel but i haven't
done a book tag one in a while so i
spent the other night just kind of
looking around seeing what kind of tags
were out there and i picked up three
that i wanted to do and like the next
coming months or so the first one that
i'm going to do is the readers problems
tag and i saw this on oh it's Mandy's
page so she did not tag me but she's the
one who I found the tag video on so i
will leave a link below to her tag video
that she did so i watched her video kind
of looked over a few of the questions
and decided i'd give it a shot the other
ones that i have is like a get to know
me but a booktube edition and then also
of reading habits tag i wasn't sure
which one to do next so if you guys have
any preference please leave in the
comments below which tag video you would
like to see me do next unless i would
happen to get tagged for something then
i would do that one first of course but
that is what today's video is going to
be and i will be tagging some of you at
the end as well so be sure to check at
the description box all of the questions
that will be there i really have no idea
of my answers yes i don't know i'm sure
i'll probably mentioned books along the
way but if anything i talked about i'll
leave linked below as well so let's just
get into the questions okay so the first
question is you have 20,000 books on
your TV are out in the world do you
decide what to read next honestly
because I run a book blog everything
that I read pretty much is scheduled for
me so I know when my reviews have to run
on chocolate plus so that is how I
decide which books I read next sometimes
I do feel like I have 20,000 books and
my reading list not gonna lie i feel
that way question two is you're halfway
through a book and you're just not
feeling it do you keep reading or do you
give up on it I
how I really can't stop reading a book
that's really hard for me to do I really
can't think of the last time that I just
like cold turkey dropped a book and was
like no I don't care how this one ends
but kind of what I do if I'm really not
enjoying a book as I will speed read
through it I realized I could speed read
and still comprehend a book like back in
grade school I think is what I realized
this talent of mine that interesting
came in handy a lot for my friends if
they would have they would be doing like
a reading essay and they would ask me
for help and I would literally speed
read and then be able to answer their
questions for me it was kind of crazy
but that's honestly what I do is I'll
just speed-read through something and
it's kind of funny when I'm like reading
an actual book and my husband will know
I don't like it because I'm just like
flipping the pages flipping the pages
needs like are you speed reading like
yes three is it's you're approaching the
end of the year and you're so close yet
so far from finishing your Goodreads
reading challenge do you try to finish
it and how do you do it I have never
done a good reads reading challenge I
usually have a personal goal to read and
review at least 100 books within the
year and i'm usually well over that so
that's pretty much my goal for myself i
keep a list of all the books that I
review on chiclet plus i have a huge
spreadsheet of all of the books that i
myself have read and reviewed and the
date that I review them and then that
way it helps me keep track of how many
books that I'm reading within the year I
have never taken the Goodreads reading
challenge though I guess I don't even
really know how you do it to be really
i'll be really honest I don't understand
Goodreads and I pretty much tend to
avoid it I know that authors appreciate
review is going on there so I will
always go on there and say what I'm
reading and i will leave the review on
the book right when I put the review on
Amazon I will immediately go over to
goodreads and put it on there but other
than that I don't really go on it I
think that's more geared toward the
other side of me it is like horrifying
to see some of the things that are being
said on Goodreads and it's really funny
because Amazon
goodreads our Amazon ohms goodreads on
amazon it's so hard for anybody to leave
a review like I think I've said this
before my channel my mom cannot review
my books so for some reason my best
friend cannot review my books on Amazon
my husband would not be able to review
my books on amazon and now it's even
getting to the point where author
friends are not being able to review for
each other because amazon is sending
like no that's an inappropriate review
you can't review for the people you know
which is I've said it before it's just
absolutely crazy this is why we make
connections in the world so we can have
people review for us and Amazon's like
no but anybody and everybody can review
on Goodreads and can write the most
horrible thing like I've seen death
threats on Goodreads I've seen the most
derogatory names being called about
people's personal character not the
characters in their books and good reads
to us nothing about it and I'm just like
now so I tend to stay off I don't look
at the reviews for my books on goodreads
I don't I don't participate in any
discussions because I just think it's a
crazy place I don't like it at all for
is the covers of a series of do not
match how do you cope oh that honestly
that really bothers me and I don't know
if it bothered me when I first started
out as much as it does like since I've
been getting into the marketing side
more these past few years and
understanding what it means to match
covers two series it really does bother
me doubt when they don't I mean it
there's very small ways that you can
have your covers match within the series
whether it's your name placement is the
same it's the same font it's the same
color a fond I I mean just like little
pieces that you can make it so people
will understand that these books are
tied together just I don't cope well
turns out the question number five is
everyone and their mother loves a book
that you didn't love who do you bond
with over your feelings I don't know um
let me think that one's kind of funny it
is really frustrating as a reader and a
reviewer when I didn't love a book and I
go on Amazon and there's like ten plus
positive reviews and I'm the only one
that's going to be negative and I have
to be that first negative
review I hate that the most I really do
but then I it makes me doubt myself and
makes me go back and think about the
book again like okay did I miss
something i'm reading everyone else's
reviews like okay they loved that that's
not what I loved or they love that I
didn't see that there it really does
make me second-guess myself but I've
been reviewing for so many years now I
understand the concept that we're all
not gonna like the same thing different
things are going to make different
people happy so I try not to get too
caught up in that anymore who do I bond
with over my feelings my dog I mean I
don't I don't have really any one
personally that I talked to about books
I mean sometimes I'll talk to my husband
or my mom or in passing a friend but I
don't really have like book lovers in my
life that I feel like I would bond with
them over but usually I can find someone
in my big virtual world that were like
you know we're the only two that didn't
like that aren't we yep britax as you're
reading a book and your buffs start
crying in public what do you do okay
this I'm this happen to be before I mean
please comment below we know if you
started crying in public over a book
because I sure have I've cried when i'm
out walking my dog listen to audiobooks
I've cried in my house like just sitting
next to my husband on the couch and next
thing we know I'm crying and he's like
what happened what how who what do you
recall crying like on public
transportation on a bus on time in high
school I was reading a welcome and
everyone liked me like I was the weird
girl yeah I've definitely cried in
public books make me cry they make me
cry how do I cope I to cry quietly and
not draw attention to myself and do the
whole plastic like hold your finger
under your eye to catch your tears so
they don't stream down your face I do
that that's how I cope but this nice one
is a long one a sequel to a book that
you love just came out but you've
forgotten a lot from the original book
what do you do do you re read the first
book do you skip the sequel do you just
try to read stuff on Goodreads to catch
up do you cry and frustration that's the
question I truly hate when that happens
to me when I feel like I love a book so
much but then a sequel is going to come
out and I
I'm trying to remember the first book
and I can't remember it because it makes
me feel like did I really love it that
much because how do you forget a book
that you love so much so then I start to
like doubt myself how much did I really
love that book and will the sequel be
worth it now typically what I do because
I review everything is if that were to
happen to me I will go back and read my
original review to see what I thought
see what my thoughts are and that
usually tends to help me out so yeah
that's pretty much what I would do
number eight is you do not want anyone
and I mean anyone to borrow your books
how do you say no when someone asks you
um that's tough because i don't think
i've ever said no to anyone borrowing my
books and i'm trying to think of why i
would say that and I like I'm someone
who I have an overflowing bookshelf all
of my butt books do not fit on my
bookshelf so usually like if I have
different people over I'm like look at
my bookshelf would you like to pick a
book out like here's your take-home
prize for coming to my house please take
a book and I gift books a lot for like
birthdays and holidays and things like
that so i don't know why i never tell
anyone i wouldn't want them to borrow a
book i truly don't think there's one
book in my collections and I'm like no
one can touch us because I like to
spread the joy of reading that's fun for
me fine is you have reading a TD you've
picked up and put down at least five
books in the month how do you get over
your reading slump I don't have time to
have reading slums I can't do that being
a reviewer and having such a set
schedule a lot of times my schedule is
so busy i'm reviewing books only two to
three days prior to what I'm needing to
review them so I don't have time to
struggle with reading a DD I just know
that I have a deadline and I made a
commitment to not there so I have to get
that book done when I said that I was
going to get it done so my schedule
dictates me to not have reading a DD
number ten is there are so many good
books coming out that you want to read
how do you choose which ones you want to
buy and that's really tough for me
because a lot of the books that I get
are
to me either from authors or publishers
or other review companies like blog
tours and things like that so that is
how I get the majority of my books I
will buy books to support an author like
a lot of times if an author that I'm
close with comes out with a new book out
i'll buy the book on the day of release
just in like support even if I'm not
reviewing the book or I haven't been
asked to review the book if just someone
that I know you know personally in my
virtual world and I'm just trying to
support them I will buy their books
there's you know a few big-name authors
that I want their books in my collection
and that's like emily giffin and sophie
kinsella are i'm just i'm looking at my
bookshelf right now and those are like
some of my hard covers that i have like
prominently displayed it's from them but
again i'm i'm super lucky to be able to
receive their books from their
publishers so I love my job number 11 is
after you buy these new books how long
do they sit on the shelf before you
actually review them I always have my
you know my review scheduled that tells
me what I need to read next when I need
to read books and then I have a fun book
collection and that is books that I via
their been sent but authors are like you
know I just want to send you my book you
don't have to review it you don't need
to there's no time frame things like
that or books that I by because I wanted
to buy them or books that friends give
me that I think that I want to read so I
always have that TBR pile too and
sometimes i do a really good job of the
review quests that come in to chiclet
plus i do a really good job to be like
hey review team how about you guys
review these and I give myself like
little breaks here and there so I can
keep up with that CBR imes like right
now I can't refuse anything and my
reading list in my reading schedule I
look at it
I'm really overwhelmed because I'm like
I have taken on too many books again
this is happening I need to cut back but
that's kind of how it's just really when
I have the little breaks in my schedule
because I'm usually always reading a
book I mean you'll never I'm never not
reading a book I'm usually you know
editing our proofreading or reading some
sort of manuscript or writing my own
book and then if I if I'm trying to read
too much at once that's so hard for me
it's hard to keep the book separate and
then it's hard to remember them because
I'll remember a book I'm reading but
then at the same time my thoughts are
intermingling with that with a book that
I was proofreading and then I'm getting
confused so I try to keep I try to keep
the amount i'm reading at one time to
minimum if i can ok so that is the
entire tag video was 11 questions i
believe so that was the readers problems
