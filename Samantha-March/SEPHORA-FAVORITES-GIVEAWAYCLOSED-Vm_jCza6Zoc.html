excited you are here today because I
won't be doing just a small little
giveaway for my subscribers I'm really
excited because this is coming at kind
of a cool time because i saw that we
just got to 700 subscribers the other
day and I was like that's so exciting I
remember being so excited when I got my
first subscriber I was like yes and then
I got to subscribers smells like no way
and I remember the day I got 100
subscribers I was like this is so crazy
I can't believe people actually like
want to listen to what I'm saying so
cool 500 I think is when I did the
giveaway and I want to do a really big
one once we get to 1000 and I mean like
I want to do a really really good
giveaway because I'm just I'm so
appreciative of everyone who has
subscribed to the channel or comments on
the channel or finds me in different
social media outlets I know a lot of you
have also been buying my books and I see
that and I'm so grateful for that like I
can't even I I cannot even tell you how
grateful I am for that so I wanted to
put together a really good big 1,000
giveaway 500 was when I believe we did I
was it 100 now I can't remember but i
did a really big book giveaway for that
milestone and so I want to do a really
big beauty giveaway for the 1000 I
haven't started buying for it yet
because I just wanted to get a little
closer to 1000 because i want to buy
stuff that's like really hot or new or
your not everyone's excited about it so
I've just been like kind of biding my
time but maybe once we get closer to 900
I'll start buying for it but I also
don't want to buy it all at once because
that might be really overwhelming from a
credit card and I've coming up though so
just thank you so much for everyone
who's subscribing if you're watching
this thank you so much it really means a
lot to me I just wanted to do a quick
little giveaway we're close to the
holiday time picked up like two little
things that I want to share with you
guys if you do follow me on snapchat
you've seen it was like a month ago that
I got this stuff in the middle and I
said it's what I was going to do for the
giveaway and now I'm finally getting
here finally getting to the giveaway so
if you want to see what you can win and
all the ways to enter in all those good
details please keep watch
such a fan of like mini sizes and
samples and that sort of thing and I
tell you guys about it on on YouTube and
Instagram and all that I thought I would
kind of go with that theme so I picked
up these two little sephora favorites
and one winner will win these is I will
have it international because I I think
that's fine like these are pretty light
I don't think that shipping what kill me
or anything like that so it'll be open
and international you do have to be
dinner over to enter or else have
parents permissions you know all that
all that good stuff this is not
sponsored by anybody this is not
sponsored by YouTube this is not
sponsored by Sephora about these with my
own money and I'm giving him way just as
like a little holiday giveaway so I feel
like you always have like get all these
disclaimers out there so I asked on I
think it was on snapchat I asked you
guys like out of the Sephora favorites
because they have like so many of them I
was like which one would you guys really
want and I'm not kidding literally
nearly everybody said the draw the line
I'm sorry hope that glare isn't like
killing you guys promised everyone said
draw the line so that was what it looks
like and so I mean I could've look like
I was getting so many snaps Sangala line
I'm like okay okay okay all right don't
worry you guys I'll bite for you so it
says it's an 88 US dollar value so it
comes with a sephora korean pencil you
got the Urban Decay 24-7 glide on pencil
with a Kat Von D tattoo liner I really
really like this stuff you got a tart
liner in there a stila waterproof liner
and the Smashbox always sharp waterproof
kohl liner so that's awesome it's really
cool actually that's really cool I
probably should have bought that for
myself because I i love high liner but
yeah so you will be winning this and
then you will also be winning the
sephora favorites it's the cleansing
ritual to go so this is what that one
looks like and I got this one because
