today's video going to be all about lips
lipstick lip swatches I am just going to
be going over the new Sephora favorite
set this is the give me some lip set it
has six different lippies in here I
absolutely love these sephora favorite
little collection kits here i think they
are amazing but a lot of people seem to
be really excited about this one
probably because we all love lipstick so
much so i decided to pick it up because
there are well i mean five out of six of
the products in here i have not tried
and so I thought what a good way to be
able to test out a few of these
different lippies I will swatch
everything and kind of give my first
impressions on each one so I'm super
excited for that there's also two
full-sized lip products in here which
makes me so excited i will go over
everything inside the value of the kit
why i think it's such an amazing value
and then also pick up an extra one
because like i said so many people seem
to be really excited about it in like
trend mood one had it on her instagram
and a lot of people were saying like how
amazing this kit looks and I was like
yes I completely agree these also can
sell out pretty fast because like I said
these these little Sephora favorites
that they come up with are so amazing i
have bought several i will continue to
buy them so people seemed excited about
it so i thought why not do a swatch
video and then also give one away so
i'll make sure you keep watching till
the end of the video and i will let you
guys know how one of you can win this
but why don't we go ahead and help into
the swatches so this is what the box
looks like it's super cute shaped like
lips I love it so again it's the sephora
favorites give me some lip this whole
thing is a twenty-eight dollars and like
I said you are getting six different
lipsticks we have to face nars kat von d
sugar lancome and Smashbox which is
crazy the Lancome juicy shaker and the
new Smashbox liquid lipstick are both
full-size products this entire kit right
here is twenty-eight dollars to buy
these Smashbox full-size lipstick on its
own is twenty-four dollars this is an
amazing steal this is an amazing seal I
will have a link down below in case you
don't want to wait and see if you won
the giveaway and you just know you want
this right now for yourself I say like
run out and get it I haven't even
started watching yet and I'm already
saying run out and get it but let's go
ahead and jump into it so the first one
that I picked up is from Too Faced it's
one of their melted liquefied long wear
lipstick in Chihuahua so this is what it
looks like this is the deluxe size of it
so to be honest I don't really like the
two face melted lipsticks i am going to
swatch this and try it on and then I
think I'll probably throw it into my bag
for my niece I'm collecting lippies that
I don't really love for myself because
she's like yeah I'll try them and I
don't really want to send anybody else
things that I've already put on my lips
that she's my niece she's cool with it
she signs that so i will probably end up
giving this to her unless for some
reason i truly love it but i have tried
out the melted lipsticks from to face
and I just think they believe too much I
will say all of the colors that i do
have from it are darker colors like a
really dark pink a dark red and then a
purple so maybe the nude will work out
better for me so this is what the
applicator looks like right there and
then I will swatch it on my hand really
pretty swatch very pretty nude color I
really like that and I'm gonna zoom you
in and then put it on my lips so here we
go two faced Chihuahua
you
okay so i have to wawa farm to face on
my lips right now I really like the
color I like I think everything in here
is more like on the nude / neutral side
which i really like it would really
prefer for myself because I tend to aim
towards more neutrals so this one looks
really pretty right now feels good on
the lips these don't drive Matt these
will continue to be more of a glossy
lipstick I do feel like the color on is
very long-lasting like I said when I
have the other colors from Too Faced
they just tend to bleed outside the lips
a lot so I might test this out you know
some night and where it a little bit
longer than in a swatch video and see if
I think this one does the same as the
others maybe if it's a nude color I
don't know maybe it won't be as bad or
as noticeable i guess but we'll have to
see so i'll hang on to this one for now
and check and see if i want it but this
color as well Chihuahua is very very
talked about probably because it's such
a beautiful nude color so I'm excited
for that and if you love these smell
that lipstick some to face because I
swear like everybody else does except
for me I think you'd be really happy to
get this in the kit we have is from NARS
it's their satin lip pencil and I really
have no idea how to pronounce the name
Rick yugen rakugahn not a clue ok so
there's what that one looks like and
then when you open it up okay so this is
what that looks like kind of like the
Korean type so let me go ahead boo that
feels that feels definitely very satiny
okay so there is that fudge right there
so it looks like a really pretty like
rose pink almost that is like glided on
so smoothly so let me go ahead do meu in
and I'll put on my lips
again this is the nars a satin
lip pencil this feels so good on the
lips is definitely not any sort of like
lip liquid lipstick it feels more like a
bomb like a moisturizing balm like it
feels moisturizing and hydrating on the
lips which I thought was really
interesting the color is really pretty
because it's not anything like super
overpowering but view of a day where you
just want to have like a little bit of
color to your lips but nothing dramatic
nothing that's going to bother you with
like the drying like a liquid lipstick
would this would be a really good choice
I'm kind of surprised at how much I
actually liked it when i swatched it I
was like I don't know you know it's kind
of sheer like I don't know if I will
love it on the lips but i really enjoy
how comfortable that feels what's really
interesting is that I never would have
bought this I just know it I don't buy
from NARS Ilan and seeing like satin lip
pencil I know I would never have gone
out and bought this for myself but I
know that I'm going to be really really
happy to have this in my collection so
that's awesome the next up we have a
deluxe size from Kat Von D is one of
these studded kiss lipsticks in let's
see in Lovecraft's ok so this packaging
is really cool if you can see that like
studs on here that's pretty cool ok this
looks like such a tiny little guy so
that is what it looks like there and
then i'll go ahead and swatch so i tried
Kat Von D's liquid lipsticks but I've
never tried like the regular lipsticks
so this one is the kat von d that is a
beautiful like pinky mob shade that's
really pretty and then if you like the
pinks and the mobs you're going to like
this one so I'll go ahead zoom you in so
you can see on my lips
you
so here is the kat von d studded
lipstick in Lovecraft lovesick Lovecraft
Lovecraft's on my lips beautiful pink
mauve color if you are a big fan of the
malls which I am I bet that you would
really like this upon putting it on like
my initial thoughts after putting it on
it feels really nice it feels very
creamy easy to rub my lips together the
pigmentation I think looks really
beautiful ok so I'm looking at myself
from the viewfinder obviously and i
really like this that's such a beautiful
neutral mom shade I really like this one
and again I'm such a fan of the liquid
lipsticks like I probably would have
just kept buying her liquid lipsticks
but I'm so excited to be able to try
this out because this color is gorgeous
from sugar it's there Rose a fresh
tinted lip treatment ok so this is what
it looks like I was really excited to
see this and I know maybe not
everybody's like the looks exciting but
I kept wanting to buy these and I
thought the packaging was super cute i'm
not going to lie and i just didn't do it
so now to be able to try it and see if I
would want to get one I think would be
really cool ok so this is what it looks
like that it's a sheer rosy tint oh man
yep I'm gonna like this ok so you might
not be able to see it really well ok so
this is it right here and again you
might be thinking like Samantha why
would that make you so excited but I
need things like this like this kind of
reminds me of my covergirl lip balm that
I have at the side of my desk because
you guys know like I wear lipsticks
everyday wear a lot of liquid lipsticks
I always try to have something on my
lips like not a lipstick like a lip balm
or something hydrating just to like keep
my lips in check because before that I
was doing that I was suffering so bad
with like peeling and cracked lips and
like getting like bumps on my lips even
like it was really bizarre so I've
always made sure to have like a lip balm
so I think this could be a really really
good option for my purse it has just a
very pretty tint like nothing like super
crazy just very subtle so this makes me
really excited now I just want to see
how it feels on my lips I'm going to zoo
me in and put it on
this feels amazing how this feels so
good and it also has an SPF in it SPF 15
well who knew this feels amazing on the
lips oh this makes me really really
excited and like you do like you can see
like there still is a tint to it but
nothing like super overpowering which I
really like because like when I'm just
sitting at home and I want something on
my lips like I don't really care if I'm
getting a lot of color payoff for it
because I'm just sitting here by myself
but mmm this is pretty it smells good
but it just it feels so nice on the lips
that has SPF I'm like super excited for
this one and that i'm super excited to
try because when they came out i was
seeing a lot different videos about it a
lot of people talking about it and I
just didn't buy any so to be able to get
a full-size product to this I'm
super-excited about it it is the Lancome
juicy shaker is in the shade boom
meringue which i think is really cute
and it says that it has a lemon meringue
flavor which I'm so curious about this
how cute is this packaging if freaking
kills me so I think you're supposed to
shake it right juicy shaker I think
you're supposed to shake it up first and
then when it comes off this is what the
applicator looks like again this is the
full-size product guys and these are
regularly $21 and the entire lip kit is
twenty-eight dollars which is awesome
what they say say that they're actually
a lip oil with a hint of shine so I
won't be able to like actually swatch it
on my hand for you guys because
technically it's just an oil but with a
little bit of shine to it but i'll go
ahead and zoom you in anyways and put it
on the lips and then give you my
thoughts i've never tried a lip also
super curious about these
okay so this is what it looks like on
the lips so you can see I mean there
definitely is shine and a little pop of
pink to it again this is the boomerang
and I think they have a couple different
like colors as well so it is a lip oil
and supposed to give you a little bit of
color I'm really excited to keep trying
this and see what I think over time like
I said I'm always trying to like nourish
my lips o Allah coil I think sounds
fantastic I know a couple different
companies were coming out with these
lipuls and I never was able to get my
hands on one so I'm really excited to
give this a try now like I said this is
a full-size product regularly $21 so I
think that's a great deal that you get
it in there especially because for maybe
something different you kind of want to
try it out like why not try it out with
five other products as well last one we
have is from Smashbox and it is their
new liquid lipstick so it is called
they're always on liquid lipstick and
the color is in stepping out I have been
hearing so many fantastic things about
this liquid lipstick and so many people
are raving about the formula and just
saying it is absolutely fantastic like
videos are still coming out about this
liquid lipstick and saying how good it
is again this is twenty four dollars and
this is a full-size product that you get
in this kit that cost you twenty eight
dollars it's crazy like what what a good
deal so I am so excited to try this on
and see what I think of it so I will go
ahead and swatch it real quick on the
hand so this applicator is definitely
very different that is what the
applicator looks like and it has like
this bend to it Christ so that's
interesting so there is the last one
here that is stepping out from Smashbox
looks very pretty it's a dusty mop
according to the website so zooming in
and then do the left's watch
you
okay so this is stepping out from a sash
max now it will dry down Matt so it is
still drying right now but initial
application I'm loving it so it says
it's a dusty mob and right now like when
I first put it on it definitely is more
Brown like almost kind of reminds me a
little bit of bow and arrow from kat von
d except and even kind of like darker
brown but me in that is gorgeous
application like I said I've never
really used that type of applicator
before so I was a little curious about
it the bend in it kind of gives you not
as much control as may be a regular
applicator but nothing like I didn't
paint outside the line is there anything
like that so it wasn't hard to put on
just was a little bit different at first
but it also went on very very smoothly
so this is one that I am so excited to
try out because everyone's been talking
about this liquid lipstick everyone's
been talking about this formula so glad
I'm able to test it out so glad i got
this color to the color that I want it
makes me so happy so again $24 you get
the full-size in the sephora favorites
kit I honestly don't think that you can
beat that especially with all the hype
around this product like this alone I
think makes it worth it and but then you
get another five products in there like
how amazing is that so hmm so happy
right now guys so those are all of the
swatches from the Sephora favorites give
me some lip kit this kit is amazing many
dollars obviously you can only buy it on
support because it is the Sephora
favorites I will go ahead and leave this
link down below honestly you guys I have
seen these favorites kits sell out
pretty fast so I would suggest if you do
want it to make sure that you get it a
lot of people are talking about the slip
one because obviously it's freaking bomb
thought that I made the decision to get
it again it will be linked below if you
are interested in picking it up for
yourself but why don't we go ahead and
happen to the giveaway for this okay so
I did decide to pick up an extra one for
a giveaway honestly I wasn't going to do
like a full likes watch a video of this
I was just going to purchase it for
myself and like included in an upcoming
hall and I thought maybe to grab this
one for like my 15k giveaway or
something and I was like you know what
there are so you know five out of the
six Livi's in here I've never tried
myself like maybe it would be
interesting to try them on for the first
time on camera give my initial
feedback let you guys see the swatches
because I'm not sure when I'll be able
to film that haul video so I was like
why not go ahead and just make a full
video on this you know I shouldn't be
too long of one I was like and I can
just do they give away right in this
video I've been doing that a little bit
more lately like I just did one with the
tart and Rouge palette where I make a
video on that certain product and then I
also pick up an extra one to give away
and it seems like you guys are really
seeming to enjoy it because I can't do
like the really big giveaway videos all
of the time because I simply am NOT able

I'm able to sprinkle in like a smaller
giveaway type of video I still think you
