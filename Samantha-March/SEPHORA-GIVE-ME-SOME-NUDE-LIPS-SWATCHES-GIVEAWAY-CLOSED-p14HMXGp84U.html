I'm super excited for today's video
because it's going to be all about the
new give me some lip collection from the
sephora favorites from sephora
and I'm excited because hey I love these
and I was super happy to get one and
it's nude lips which is completely me so
I'm gonna be going through each one and
swatching them and letting you know my
thoughts but then I also have two more
that I'm going to be doing a giveaway
with so I'm going to be doing a giveaway
and there will be one youtube winner and
then also one Instagram winner so if you
are interested in winning your own
Sephora give me some nude lip collection
then keep watching until the end I'm
gonna go through first and swatch
everything let you know what is inside
let you know why I think these are such
a great value and then the giveaway
details will be at the end but if you
would like to see what is inside this
cute little lip shaped box just keep
watching so again this is what the box
looks like super cute now I love these
Sephora favorite sets I especially love
the lip sets because I'm a lipstick
junkie I love it it's a really good
value and you're able to test out a lot
of different products which i think is
fantastic though for this whole set it's
28 dollars like we have lipsticks lip
pencils and then two of them are
actually going to be full-sized so four
of them are more like deluxe sized
samples but then two products are
full-size from the Sephora website it
says this is a multi branded nude hued
lip set again it's $28 it says it's an
$88 value that includes two full-size
and four deluxe sized nude lip
essentials so inside we have the bite
Beauty amuse-bouche lipstick in
honeycomb we have the buxom full-on lip
cream in white Russian which everyone
talks about so I'm super excited to get
that the Estee edit the fairest contour
lip liner in the buff Marc Jacobs Beauty
Lamarck lip cream in slow-burn I've
never tried one of those so very happy
from Too Faced the melted matte
liquefied matte long-wear lipstick in
Queen B everyone talks about those matte
lipsticks as well and have never tried
them super excited and then also the
Urban Decay vice lipstick in 1993
comfort matte
I'm going to be going through each one
I'll do some swatches on my hands and
then I'll also do swatches on my lips so
we can see what they look like a huge
fan
of nude lips I wear them the majority of
the time that's typically what I'm
reaching for so I'm excited maybe I'll
find some new ones and the only thing I
did get sent this bite beauty one in
honeycomb I did just get sent this in an
influencer box so I'm not gonna actually
swatch this one I'll grab up the ones
that I've already been wearing and this
will just go into a future giveaway but
other than that I've never even tried
like I said haven't tried the Too Faced
haven't tried the buxom haven't tried
the Marc Jacobs haven't tried the Urban
Decay haven't tried the Esther at it so
that's pretty darn good that I get to
try all these out for $28 so I'm gonna
jump in first with a honeycomb from by
beauty like I said this one is mine and
this is what I got sent from influencer
it also came with the lip liner and I
instantly fell in love with this I'm
pretty sure you're gonna see this in my
February favorites video instantly fell
in love with the shade such a gorgeous
nude and it's the it's kind of like that
beige nude that actually looks good on
me sometimes beige nudes pull a little
bit like to tan or to almost I don't
even know like to brown I don't know
they just don't look good on me and this
one this one I really really do like so
there is a swatch of honeycomb it's
super creamy and really comfortable on
the lips so here is honeycomb on my lips
I love this shade I seriously the first
time I tried it on I became obsessed
with it I'm okay I mean I know these are
just little guys that we got sent but
still I mean I feel like that's a lot of
product so I'm probably okay so giving
it away I probably don't need a backup
but honestly I feel like when I run out
of this I would repurchase it in the
full size I've never tried the amuse
bouche lipsticks from by beauty until I
was sent this from Influenster and I was
just immediately impressed so super
stoked to find a new nude that I
absolutely love I've been wearing it so
much lately because I just feel like the
snoot is just so flattering for my
particular skin tone and I just really
like it so first one up is honeycomb
from bite Beauty and this gets an A+
from me
so next time I'm gonna try the lip liner
I'll use it to line my lips but then
I'll actually fill it in as well and see
what we get so this is from the essay
Edit by Estee Lauder and it's the shade
in the buff so I'm gonna assume is this
a full size I mean I don't know I guess
I'm gonna assume this is a full side of
the lip liner because the
what it looks like so there is the
swatch of that sign my lips and then
fill it in and see what it looks like
okay so this is what the SA edit liner
and in the buff looks like again very
pretty nude color it's a bit of a darker
nude which I do not mind it's really
creamy and it went on easily but I
realized that because I used it to fill
in my lips as well which sometimes I do
with lip liners it's actually kind of
sticky which is surprising to me because
usually I guess I don't really feel like
lip liners are usually all that sticky
but I still love this color really
really pretty color so I'm not mad at
that I wish it wasn't as sticky as it
was but I probably won't use this to
fill in my entire lips in I'll just use
it as a lip liner but this will be a
really good lip liner for me because
these are the temperatures I wear so the
lip liner would fit in well with them I
don't wear a lip liners all the time
like every single time I wear lipstick
or liquid lipstick I don't always wear a
lip liner but they are nice to have the
option because there are some especially
liquid lipsticks where you simply need
to have a lip liner so I'm excited to
get a new nude one actually that sa edit
lip liner was really hard to get off
even a swatch on my hand I was like
scrubbing at it and I was like really
trying to scrub my lips I went for that
one second because I thought it would be
easier to get off but that was not easy
to get off and that is also one of the
full-size products the other full-size
is the Urban Decay but next I'm gonna
try this Marc Jacobs this is their
Lamarck lip cream in slow burn so this
is what the deluxe eyes looks like and
I've never tried these lippies so I'm
really excited about it there is what
that one looks like okay so here is the
swatch of the Marc Jacobs it's
definitely more of like like a nude pink
on the sephora website it describes it
as a new rose but it also says it's
creamy and this is super creamy like
immediately as I was putting on my lips
I was like this just feels comfortable
feels nice it's gliding super easily
across my lips so I'm super excited I'm
excited to see how this wears throughout
the day I can't wait to like really test
out these lipsticks and see how they do
so far this is definitely the pinkest of
the nudes that I have tried and again
with nude lipsticks it really depends on
your skin tone because nudes looked if
for everybody of course so I think in
this collection they did a good job of
kind of mixing up the tones at least so
far what I'm seeing
cuz first we had like a straight nude
like beige nude which I thought was
really pretty and then with the essays
edit it was a little bit of a darker
nude and then this one is more of a pink
nude so so far at least on my skin tone
like I'm seeing some different nudes
thrown in there which I really like that
idea so this Marc Jacobs a lip cream
this feels really nice so I'm pretty
excited about this one guys okay so next
up I want to try the urban decay
lipstick this is in nineteen and ninety
three and again this is a full-size
product everyday like the packaging on
this this looks really cool I don't know
if I have any Urban Decay lipsticks I'm
pretty sure I don't
so here is what that one looks like and
let's see ooh
this okay so the name 1993 makes total
and complete sense to me this is such a
90s color kind of like that Brown nude
like a grungy Brown I think I'm gonna
like this one but let's see it on the
lips I can definitely tell even after
only what does it been three lippies
that my lips are like sorry buddy come
raw and a little bit bigger and a little
bit harder to apply it excuse me of my
lipstick application from here on out
isn't the best it's it's kind of hard
when you're immediately scrubbing off
lipsticks but yeah this one's awesome I
love these type of grungy nudes I think
they are so cool so again I don't know
this isn't probably what I would think
of when I think of like a nude lipstick
because it is such a deeper Brown on me
but definitely again depends on your
skin tone but mmm I really like it I
think this would actually pair really
well with the essay edit lip liner I
think they would be a good combo again
it feels really creamy if you know as a
regular lipstick it's not a liquid
lipstick and I like that we're getting a
combination you know lip liners
lipsticks liquid lipsticks I like that
we kind of have it all in this
collection but I really like this color
again I'm excited to see how these wear
throughout the day I'm excited to have
an urban decay lipstick and a full-size
one at that that's so cool so this next
one is from buxom it's the full-on lip
cream in White Russian
and I feel like I've heard so many
people talk about this and I am Way
excited to try it so here's what the
packaging looks like the swatch I don't
know if you'll be able to see it great
because it's pretty light and sheer but
let's try it on the lips so this is wild
like I said I've never tried these
full-on lip creams from buxom and
immediately as I put it on I was like
that's weird my lips are tingling I'm
like oh maybe it's because I've just
been scrubbing at my lips but then I'm
like nope I'm pretty sure I'm gonna go
with this because my lips are still
tingling as soon as I put this on as
soon as you put it on your lips will
tingle and I swear to you they already
look bigger maybe it's just because I've
been scrubbing out of like I said but I
swear they already look bigger so these
lip creams from the Sephora website
reading the bottom it says they are a no
stick lip gloss and they're supposed to
have a tingling and plumping effect well
I just got even more excited about this
because I didn't even know that was a
thing until I put it on and I was like
why is this making my lips tingle I
really like it I mean it's just like a
clear lip gloss it has a little bit of
like a pink tinge to it again could be
because I've been doing some lip
swatches but this is I like this I like
this a lot if you don't like lip
plumpers or if you don't like having
tingly lips I mean this definitely it's
not gonna be for you but I like it so
far so I'm excited to try this one out
so again this is buxom White Russian I
saved a liquid lipstick for last because
these are always the hardest to get off
so this is the Too Faced melted matte in
Queen B so this is supposed to be like a
moth type pink and I heard a lot about
these melted mattes from Too Faced and a
lot of people seem to really like them
and I know Queen B it was a really
popular color there were several times I
went to my Sephora to swatch it and see
if I liked it and Queen B was completely
sold out like I couldn't even watch it
they had no tester so I'm excited
because I love these mathtype of shades
I was hesitant to get it because I
actually didn't like the Too Faced
they're like regular lipstick the melted
lipsticks I really didn't like them so a
little bit leery about these new ones so
there's a swatch of that one
so looks really nice but let's go ahead
and see what
looks like on the lips for our sixth and
final lip swatch but here is what queen
bee looks like on my lips the first
thing that I noticed was that this dries
super fast like really really fast by
the time I got done applying the product
my top lip and I kind of did like one of
those I could tell that the product was
already dry so definitely if you have
this you really want to work quick make
sure you get it on there I like the
shade it's almost a little like too
purple for my liking when it comes to
moths I like more maybe of like the pink
mauve versus the purple mob so it's a
little bit more purple on me but it's
still really pretty I still like it it
feels good so far but again I don't have
any thing to say I'm like the longevity
of it or the long lasting about or
anything like that but it's still a very
pretty liquid lipstick and I'm excited
to finally be able to try out of this a
formula so here's our final swatch Queen
B from Too Faced okay so those are all
of the swatches and kind of my first
thoughts on each of the lippies and they
give me some nude lip set from a Sephora
in the Sephora favorites collection if I
had to pick a favorite I don't know well
I love the honeycomb I love the bite
Beauty honeycomb but I knew that before
I got this set and then I really liked
both the Marc Jacobs and the urban decay
lipstick I think I like the Marc Jacobs
a little bit more but then I also really
liked that buxom lip gloss like I'm
actually really excited to keep trying
it the only one that I wasn't like a
huge fan of early was the Estee edit lip
liner and that's just because it was
really sticky when I put it all over my
lips but I think as just a lip liner
it'll work I just don't wear lip liners
a ton so I'm kind of bummed that that
was one of the full-size products versus
one of the lippies that I might get more
wear out of but that's totally okay I
can still make it work but yeah those
are my thoughts on those and then let's
get into the giveaway because like I
said I have two extra ones here I'm
going to be doing a giveaway there will
be one youtube winner in one Instagram
