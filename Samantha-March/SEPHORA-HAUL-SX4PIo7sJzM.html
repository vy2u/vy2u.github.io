super excited for today's video because
I'm finally doing my Sephora ha and this
is a collective haul so I think I've
placed for orders in november and
december so i'm going to be showing
everything that i got from these orders
I actually do have another order on the
way it's not here yet it's not going to
get here for another two days so I
didn't want to like delay filming this
so I'll just I'll talk about those other
things that are coming in but everything
else I have here to show you so I'm
super excited for this I haven't done a
Sephora haul in a long time and then I
just kind of went crazy with like the
vib sale going on and then like just the
other day I got an extra like $25 like
coupon code from them I was like okay so
yes if you would like to see what I have
recently gotten from Sephora please keep
watching a few things that i do want to
mention first off if you don't have a
Bates please get ebay I kind of can't
believe if you are like a regular
watcher of YouTube videos especially
with Beauty videos that you don't have
you Bates but I at one point to not have
you Bates myself I've now gotten it but
II Bates is basically just a cashback
website you go to the ebates website you
find the store that you want to shop at
you click on the link that takes you to
the store and you get cash back my
Sephora orders the lowest amount that I
got was four percent back but then one
day they had like a double day one day
only it was eight percent cash back at
sephora and you can bet your bottom
dollar that I bought some stuff that day
so that's a really big thing I will
leave ebates linked below if you don't
have it i really suggest you get it but
another like big reason why I do like
multiple sephora orders instead of
ordering all in one is because sephora
has like I feel like they have such a
great program not only did I have the
beauty insider and the vib vib rouge
loyalty program which is basically you
get points for like every dollar that
you spend if you're a beauty insider I
believe it is and you get
little perks along the way like you can
build up points and once you have a
hundred points they have 100 point perk
items that you can get for free and then
they have 250 and 500 dollars and then
you get like certain coupons and
discounts like I think the beauty
insiders just got a fifteen dollar gift
card for them for the holidays which I
thought was really cool and then if you
become a VIP member which basically
means that you spent a lot of money at
sephora in a year you get more perks and
bonuses you get like special items like
they had the tart contour palette at
sephora you could only get it I think if
you were a vib remember I don't think is
vib rouge but you get like special
little things for your birthday's things
like that we got a $25 gift card for the
holidays but you also get to take part
in the vib sale which is where you get
twenty percent off you know that sort of
thing for it was like a whole little
week or a weekend or like four days or
something you would get twenty percent
off anything at the Sephora site so they
have a really great loyalty program but
also in every online order that you
place you get three free samples so and
there's like 12 or 15 samples that you
get a pic from so that's really
important always make sure you're
getting your three free samples a lot of
times I like to get like perfume because
i like the little trouble perfume so
like throw in my clutch from going out
at night I have you know I don't have to
worry about having a big bottle perfume
or a big bottle body spray in my clutch
so I like to get those but they also
always have like a free deluxe mini with
your purchase and that's really why I
break it down into these different
orders you get free shipping for I think
it's fifty dollars so i always just make
sure I hit that fifty dollar limit but
then three free samples every time and
then you're free deluxe mini and they
usually have their different weekly
specials like they change every week so
one week I got a makeup clutch filled
with like 12 samples or something like
20 samples I don't know it was like a
million samples I remember doing it I
was doing the unboxing on snapchat and I
was like oh my gosh I kind of forgot how
many samples were in here it was crazy
but then another week you got aid a
clutch and
was filled with like I think it was
aight deluxe mini samples so like good
sized bottles not just like a sample
that you put on foundation once sort of
thing like it was good sized bottles to
try out for all these samples so there's
just so many good things my most recent
order that I did right now on safaris
website they're having like a merry mini
25 day celebration so every single day
they have a new deluxe mini that you can
get with your purchase each day another
one gets unwrapped and I kind of
wondered if you had to purchase that day
of the mini but that is not the case
because I just placed my order the other
day and when I went to check out i typed
in Mary mini I think it is in the code
and then it popped up all like I think
it was six at the time like all six
samples that had already come out and I
gotta pick which one I wanted so it
didn't have to be just that day but I
got a mask because I'm really test
skincare right now but if I do end up
placing another order through December
I'll probably have it be later in
December maybe I'll get a gift card for
Christmas okay I'll pick so i can have
like all those minis to pick from so i
don't know that's just a tip if you guys
aren't super familiar with sephora i
know not that long ago i really wasn't
that familiar and i was either placing
like big bulk orders thinking like oh
you know don't pay for shipping but
really it's only fifty dollars shipping
you get all your samples you get your
deluxe mini it's great let's get into
the hall oh I am really into like
sampling things I'm very much into
getting like smaller products and and
paying less money than buying a
full-size item and either a not liking
it or I think I've talked about this
before but it is really hard to go
through makeup and skincare and even
hair products like it just takes a long
time to get through everything and then
something new one hat comes out and then
we buy that and then you just have old
makeup sitting there so I'm I'm really
okay with spending less money getting a
smaller amount of product and maybe
actually going through it or if not
getting pretty far down there so kind of
a lot what I have to share with you guys
are like Minnie's of things or sample
kits or things like that but the first
one that I have
is this glam glow mask I've been really
interested in trying glam glow because
I've seen a lot of people on YouTube
talk about it and I was like I really
want to get them but a full-size product
is seventy dollars and I'm like seven
dollars that seems like a lot for a
skincare mask who knows how my skin is
going to react to it like should i do it
but you can get these little mini guys
for 19 which I thought was a much better
deal and so the one that I got is the
thirsty mud hydrating treatment so I am
all about hydrating right now my poor
skin it's very cold here in my skin is
just becoming dryer I've been talking
about how much i'm using my oils lately
and I've just been really into trying to
make my face stay hydrated and not like
flake off in the winter like it always
does so I got this I have used it
probably three or four times this is
what it looks like on the inside and
basically for this one like they have a
lot of different glam glow mass and they
do different things and they go on
differently this one goes on clear which
when I started to put it on I've just
watched a lot of videos on the glam glow
masks and a lot of them are like green
and black and you know things like that
I started to put this one on and it's
clear and I'm like am i doing something
wrong and so I had to run downstairs to
my computer and read the directions but
basically what it's what I think it's
really good for is to be used as an
overnight mask so you just put it on
before bed you sleep in it you get up in
the morning you wash it off and your
face is more hydrated you can also put
it on and leave it on for like 10 or 15
minutes and then wash it off but I'm all
about overnight masks I think that's
like I'm just super into them right now
so that's the four times that I've used
it I've used it as the overnight mask I
really like this because I feel like in
the morning when I wake up and I look in
the mirror I feel like my skin looks
better and sometimes when I wake up in
the morning and I look in the mirror
like I kind of look like red or splotchy
or you know I got like the dry areas are
kind of like starting to peel off when i
use this i can actually see a difference
in the morn
in the mirror and that to me is super
impressive so as of right now I am so
happy with this like I said the little
guy is nineteen dollars they have a lot
of different ones and I think I'll try
out a few more of those because really
happy with my first product they're like
mini thing that I got because I hear so
many people talking about it is the
cinema secrets the makeup brush cleaner
so I got this little guy they have like
a medium and then like a big kahuna as
well I got this little one I think it
was like eight dollars but I'm like uh
I'll test it out I'll see what I think
holy crap this stuff works so the whole
like premise behind this is that it's a
quick drying rinse free formula so
basically it's supposed to be really
good for like say you only have one
blending brush and you want to use four
different colors you can then use your
same brush clean it with this and it's
immediately dry it's not wet you don't
have to wait for it to dry nothing and I
was like this sounds like it's coming
too good to be true it really does work
now it's not a deep cleaner like I've
watched a lot of videos on this I've
seen like coffee break with Danny had a
really great like cyan't up Scientology
no scientific breakdown of this and like
how it works and how it you know clings
on to the bristles you know all the
thing I thought her video breakdown was
really good of it's not a deep cleaning
like you still need to deep clean your
brushes make sure there's no bacteria
and that sort of thing but if you just
need a clean brush quickly this works
really well mine is a spray bottle so
the little guy is a spray so you'll just
like sprite once I spray it right on my
brush and then I just take my brush and
I wipe it on a paper towel or a clean
like washcloth and it's amazing because
I mean you do you just see that project
to come right off the brush and you have
a clean brush oops I'm super impressed
with it I'm definitely going to get once
this runs out which I mean I know that I
will go through this but once it runs
out all by the bigger one of it and
those you like pour into a cup but they
don't have sprays I'm pretty sure so
yeah
Lee happy with that so another item that
I was really excited to get because
again I hear a lot about it is the laura
mercier I got the secret brightening
powder so I have been wanting a new like
setting powder especially for my like
under eye concealer and everyone talks
about Laura Mercier I hear a lot about
the secret brightening powder and then I
hear a lot about the just plain
translucent powder but I've also really
been into like brightening up my under
eye area I know like a lot of people
right now we're really into like making
it super bright under there and I'm like
yes I'm on that bandwagon let's do it so
that's why I got this so far i really
like it it is very bright like it
brightens and sometimes it almost makes
me too bright that I'm like what do I
need to calm it down so it's not like my
everyday setting powder but like special
occasions when I'm going out somewhere
then I reach for it the only like bad
thing I'm finding is like I literally
don't want to open this to show you guys
the product because it goes everywhere
it's very messy it's very sloppy now I'm
like I kind of can't wait like I want to
keep using it because I want to get it
down there so every time I open it it's
not like poof and just like powder goes
everywhere I mean my bathroom sink looks
like looks like something but but yeah
I've really been liking it so far I
thought this was a cute little bottle
and this bottle I believe was 25 or 26
dollars at Sephora this was actually a
100-point perk that I picked up and it's
the bosha boss boss skill I don't
actually know how to say that but it's
their purifying cleansing gel and I
actually was going to get a full size of
this I had it like on my love's list and
i think it was twenty-eight dollars for
a full size and I was like oh I just
don't know if I should pull the trigger
on it and I was putting in a different
sephora order and i liked at the point
perks and this was a 100-dollar one for
a little mini guy of it and I was like
it's like fate because those point for
exchanged I don't know if they change
every week every month whatever they do
but they do change often and so that one
was in there at that time I was ordering
so I just figured it was fate and I
should go ahead and order it I really
like it I will
purchase the full size of this when i'm
out which i'm about halfway down there
right now but i liked it um I don't love
the like how I would just pour it into
my hand but I don't know for sure what
the full size one is like but I mean
that's not really a big deal i have but
i like the way it feels on my skin it is
very cleansing but it feels very like
it's not abrasive or anything like that
it just I'm really liking it I've been
very loyal to it in the morning this is
especially what I've been using in the
morning and I think it's really helped
to improve my skin ok so I have been
really into skincare lately and I've
been wanting to like step my game up
when it comes to skin care when I first
got on youtube I did like my skin care
video and it basically is all like
drugstore and affordable products that I
use because I would try hyatt like
higher-end products and I would break my
skin out I have very sensitive skin and
so I'm like you know what I'm not going
to do it because why waste my money it
hurts me it makes my skin not very cute
at all like it's just not going to work
and I know a lot of times with skincare
they say like if something does break
you out it's probably good because it's
probably working and yes I do agree with
that to an extent but it shouldn't break
me out like i would use products that
would never clear up my skin i break out
when i started using them and then i
would continue to stay broken out like
it it clearly was not good for my skin
but been watching a lot more videos i've
been interested in trying something new
and getting like a good routine going
and I was started to see a lot about
first aid beauty and so I picked up this
kit and I already busted into it because
I couldn't wait so sorry I I definitely
did break into it but I didn't want to
wait I really wanted to start trying it
out but the good thing that I've heard
about first aid beauty is that it's
supposed to be good for people with
sensitive skin and that is me so I
thought you know why not give this a
shot so this was a five piece set and it
was for fifty four dollars on sephora
and i thought you know what that's
probably really good he came with the
facial radian
pads which I was really curious to try
it came with their sleeping cream a
vitamin hydrating mist the ultra Repair
Cream which I have started to hear a ton
about and then also their face cleanser
so I just thought you know this could be
really perfect and so i've been using
everything in here basically what i do
at night is i use their face cleanser to
get everything off of me again it is
like it's cleansing enough that it's
getting off my makeup and it's cleaning
my skin but it's not abrasive it does
not hurt me I've been using the sleeping
cream almost every single night I'm
sleeping in that and then when I'm not
sleeping in that I'm usually using the
glam glow mask great I think my skin
looks good in the morning the ultra
Repair Cream I've been using on my body
I times when i get out of the shower
i'll use my neutrogena body oil and then
on days when i'm not showering and like
i'm basically like changing out of one
pair of yoga leggings and to another
I'll use the ultra Repair Cream like on
my legs of my arms and things like that
the vitamin hydrating mist I truly don't
know if that is doing anything because
i'm using so many other things i'm not
quite sure but at night are in the
morning i'll just spritz my face like my
clean bare-faced l spritz that and
hopefully it's doing something the
facial radiance path i have been
super-impressed with I I really do like
these i'm using them every single night
sometimes I'll use like a lot of times
at night i'm using this first day beauty
cleanser other nights i will use a
different cleanser or an exfoliator
whatever it is i think my skin needs but
now i'm usually taking every single
night taking one of these paths and
running it over my face because if I've
missed any makeup these pads are taking
that off but it leaves me with like a
tingling sensation that I'm like I know
it's cleaning my skin it's exfoliating
it's getting down there it's it makes my
face feel so clean so so far I'm really
impressed with this I'm really happy i
picked it up $54 45 products i thought
was a good deal so far i'm very
impressed with it
I feel like first aid beauty is gonna be
like my calling okay so i just wanted to
share like a few samples that i was
particularly excited to get because with
all these orders I've been giving so
many different samples like there's no
way I could sit here and talk to you
about all the different samples that I'm
getting there's just no way but i
thought i would share a few with you and
this is one of like the little makeup
bags that came in with all my samples I
just thought it was so cute so sephora
like black and gold i really liked it so
just threw a few in here to chat about
but one sample that I got is the air
patrol from benefit so it says it's a BB
cream eyelid primer and helps lock on
eyeshadow Patrick protect hydrate and
color correct your eyelids I've been
hearing more and more about this on
youtube and so I thought it was really
interesting to get I just recently got
it so I haven't like this is the little
sample right here I haven't busted into
it yet but I'm crossing my fingers that
I'm really gonna like it because just
this past sephora order I ordered I like
took another sample of this so hopefully
I really like it so I got a sample of
the kat von d ink liner and i got mine
in trooper so it's just this little
sample guy that's what the eyeliner
looks like i've used this a few times
and holy crap i am so impressed with
this eyeliner I'm impressed with the
color I'm impressed with how easily it
glides on I'm impressed how like easy
the application was I'm not great with
these like felt tip yet like I don't
feel like I'm super good at them yet and
this just made it so easy it stayed on I
mean it stays on all day I'm so happy
with this I will definitely want this
runs out this will be getting a full
size this has to go in my collection got
the bite Beauty there agave lip mask and
it came in three different shades
champagne natural and smashed I've been
really liking this I they're pretty much
all empty um but it's just like a really
thick lip mask I really like it when I
need like hydration on my lips and my
lips are feeling extremely trapped I
just throw this on and I've been really
liking it so got the origins for
Shane I cream to brighton &amp;amp; D puff it
was just this little little sample guy
but i have been using it so much it
really like brightens the other I the
under eye and it's like almost like a
color corrector as well I've been really
i could really impressed with it i've
been using it almost every single
morning like as I prep my skin to put
makeup on I put this under my under eyes
and I've been loving it I'm almost out
of it thing is another like skin care
product it's from amore Pacific it's
their future response future response
age defense cream that's what it looks
like and I thought like it was kind of
interesting I don't know that's what the
actual product looks like it's just like
a white cream but you put it on your
face it's supposed to help you know fine
lines wrinkles all that sort of thing I
just like really like the way it feels
like it's like a thick cream but it's
not hard to blend into my face and again
I'm just like crossing my fingers that
it's doing some doing something to my
skin a few samples that I wanted to
share with you and I really like this
cute little bag so I wanted to share
that as well and I have two more
products that are coming I almost forgot
to tell you guys about that i have also
ordered the becca backlight priming
filter it is a primer but it's supposed
to be like incredibly luminous and just
make your skin look bright and fresh and
luminous and dewy and all that good
stuff it was thirty-eight dollars and so
I kept it being on the fence about it
and I just wasn't sure and then when I
got the $25 off at sephora I was like
this is the time to get it because I
just wasn't sure I didn't do it for the
vib sale and then I kind of hated myself
so I'm like that was really dumb you
should have just don't know I couldn't
get it because it sold out during the
sale that was why I didn't get exciting
in my head like I would have been a
really smart time to get it it was sold
out a lot of things sold out really
faster and that's that when I was kind
of bummed about it but it did come back
in stock so I got it very excited to try
it I'll let you guys know what I think
about it but then I also ordered myself
some eyelashes I'm so so excited for
these eyelashes so I have never owned
like a
I end pair of eyelashes I'm not really
sure what else you'd call it I basically
have only ever used our dell i have
tried i lure once and i actually ended
up not really liking them at all but
i've been looking into getting like a
classy pair of eyelashes and i went with
hooter beauty I'm not totally sure if
I'm saying that right but her eyelashes
are now in sephora in America and I'm
super excited if you guys aren't
familiar um with who to beauty she has a
YouTube channel I think she's in Armenia
and now I'm not totally sure i'm saying
that right but she's absolutely
beautiful she started her eyelash
company and if you guys see like the
eyelash for cases and like it looks like
a pair of eyes that's her lashes and
I've just been so excited to get out of
heard so many people say really good
things about them and now they're being
sold in the US stores at Sephora so I
thought why not just get it and then you
guys want me to tell you what's that i
bought i will about him and samantha i
mean like how perfect is that and they
looked like a pair of lashes i actually
wanted to get because they had like some
extreme lashes and then they had like
pretty natural lashes and Samantha was
kind of right in the middle and so I
thought let's go ahead and get them
they're more expensive there I believe
there were twenty dollars but again i
had my gift card and so I was like you
know what let's just do it I had a
really horrific experience with our dell
recently and I was very sad about it it
was during my holiday makeup tutorial I
thought you know what good time to get
some get some the eyelashes so I'm
really excited I'll definitely share a
picture with you guys and I'll let you
know okay so that has been my recent
sephora halls that I've done I hope you
guys enjoyed that video if you guys have
any things that I mentioned please do
comment below and let me know how you've
been liking them or oops you know
anything that I've mentioned that you've
been really wanting to get please let me
know I've you know some of these
products have been able to review for
you some of the reviews are yet to come
but I will definitely let you guys know
maybe some of them will show up in
favourites videos who knows some
information I gave you about sephora was
helpful
look maybe as some of you didn't know
that yet you know I'm pretty new to the
makeup and beauty world myself so a lot
of the knowledge that I've gotten has
come from YouTube so sometimes i feel
like i should skip it over because I
feel like you all probably already know
but there was a time that I didn't know
and maybe that youtuber was like maybe
people don't need to know but I'm going
to tell them so that's kind of how I
think of it but yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this video please do give it a
thumbs up if you liked seeing the halls
