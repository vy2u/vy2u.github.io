today's video it's going to be a little
bit different I'm going it to be
decluttering my Sephora love's list here
on camera with you guys so the vib sale
is going on the day I'm filming it is
started today
party placement order my hole will be
coming I've done a V IV recommendations
in wishlist video but around the time of
the vib sale that's when I go through my
loves list and I take off items maybe
I've already purchased items that don't
interest me anymore
things like that and I started doing it
the other day that I thought hello
you're a youtuber you should be filming
this I know I've seen other people do
this before as well I live from live
loves her makeup us done it I believe
I've seen Jessica Braun did the style of
video so I will link them down below of
course but I did us over in my Instagram
if you guys would want to see this video
and a lot of you said yes and one person
said that you thought it could be like a
support vib sale anti haul of sorts so
that's what we're gonna be doing today
I'm gonna let you know the items that
I'm removing from my Sephora loves list
but I decided not to pick up from this
sale so why don't I go ahead and get
started
alrighty so starting off with I just
have my love's lists pulled up here on
my phone okay so I have the fresh soy
face cleanser for $38 on my Sephora
love's list I constantly get the minis
of these I think I mentioned this in my
Sephora products that never make it out
of my cart video I'll have that listed
down below and my most recent Sephora
loves this video as well in case you
want to see more kind of on the same
vein of these videos but I somehow
always get a mini it's either in like a
kit that I'm buying I get a 100-point
perk I almost always have this cleanser
in my collection but I just cannot
purchase the full size because I just
always get the mini somehow so I'm just
gonna go ahead and remove that from my
love's list because it's just ridiculous
how long it has been on there little
silly okay also on here is the Becca the
shimmering skin Perfector in a prismatic
amethyst so this is a highlight I
actually did have a subscriber send this
to me
I've only tried it a couple times so far
but it's so beautiful I love Becca
highlights they're just so expensive
they're $38 so I really like buy the
highlights but I always try to get them
like during a sale or something or I
have my Ulta coupon or something like
that because
thirty-eight dollars for one highlight
is expensive so I was so excited when
not showing up in my peel box it's got a
beautiful like purple shift to it it's
so pretty but since I do have that one
in my collection I'm gonna go ahead and
remove that one all righty so next up I
think this also was in my items that
don't make it out of my cart or whatever
I call that a video and this one I
actually put in my recommendations in
wishlist video in my wishlist section
and I cut it out because that video is I
think those 28 minutes long
when I first like went through and did
my rough cut of everything it was at
like 38 minutes I think it was and like
this is too long I only ended up
removing one product that I was either
recommending or was on my wish list and
it was this guy because I'm like you're
not buying it I know you're not buying
it they know you're not buying it you're
not buying it don't even put it in your
wish list because it's stupid it's the
white I sell to chic lot blur primer
it's $52 for a primer I'm not buying it
like why I don't know it just continues
to sit here on my loves list and I'm
like get it together you're not buying
it I know a lot of people speak really
highly of this primer and you know what
maybe maybe down the road one day I'll
buy it but as of right now I can't see
myself buying a $52 primer I it hurts me
to buy like a $50 foundation I do it I
have the Dior forever skin on today that
I believe that foundation is $52 but
something about a $52 primer I'm just
not doing it I'm gonna go ahead and
remove it um I do have on here the Lula
Hendrickson at poor balance at facial
sauna scrub I'm gonna remove it because
I did purchase the full-size of it I had
a mini I fell in love with it purchase
the full-size one of my favorites I
recommended it in the sale the Clinique
take the day off cleansing balm for 2950
I'm gonna go ahead and remove this
because it's been on my list for a while
and I'm just now purchasing it and I
just I don't think I'm going to if there
are so many other makeup removers that I
really love I recommend it in that video
the Lula Hendrickson three-in-one
melting cleansing balm or whatever it's
called I really love that one there's
other ones that I just I prefer so much
more and for whatever reason the
Clinique one there was one time in
Sephora where I was in store and I had
it in my hand
and I was between I had a gift card so
it was either between the clinic or the
ulla Hendrickson
sauna scrub I could only get one and I
went with the EULA hendrickson
repurchase because I'm like you know I
know I have other ones of these that I
love like I know a lot of people enjoyed
this one but it's just unnecessary for
me to purchase right now so I'm gonna go
ahead I'm gonna remove that one next up
here I have the Natasha de Nona mini
sunset eyeshadow palette for $25 my
friend Candice did send it to me
I actually reviewed it recently in a
video I can leave a link down below if
you want to see my thoughts on this
palette but I do have it in my
collection so I'm gonna go ahead and
remove that so I ended up not purchasing
this is remember the anti haul part can
come in I said in my wish list video
that I was thinking about purchasing one
of the new huda beauty liquid matte
minis so you get four mini like mini
liquid lipsticks for $33 and there was
two sets that I had my eye on I decided
not to do it I purchased other lip
products and said for the sale I decided
not to do this one because I seriously
have I think it's 10 or 12 of the hooda
lipsticks and each set that I want it
had at least one minion that I do
already have so even though I think
they're a good value I was like well
technically now I'm paying thirty three
dollars for three minis because I
already have one in each of the sets so
it just it did seem worth it to me so I
decided not to buy that one so I'm gonna
go ahead and remove that one too still
think it's a great deal of though still
think it's great deal I gotta say the
Anasazi Beverly Hills a soft palette is
on my love's list I did get that sent to
me as a birthday gift from my friend at
Katie Marie from my vanity here I'm
youtube which I was so excited about
again I did review it in that same video
with the Natasha had to note appellate
so I'm gonna go ahead and remove it
because it now is in my collection but
yeah that was on my love so it's like
from the moment it came out I so wanted
that palette but I was on such a firm
low buy that I was like don't you do it
girl don't you do it so to give that as
a birthday gift was so freakin sweet so
a big thank you again to Katie for that
I feel like this might be a regret from
the sale and I know that the VIP Rouge
can shop again is it next weekend I
think it is we get to shop again yeah
next weekend we do get to shop a second
time and I still might purchase this but
I
in my Hall that I placed this morning it
was the Sephora collection 57 brush for
$24 and I think my problem is is I had a
number in mind that I wanted to spend on
the sale my first time through it was
way over and I went through and I cut
things down and I said no I'll to put up
their 20% coupon sneaky-sneak yes you
use so I also placed into harder with
Ulta I'll do that all in the haul video
too but I was right at the number where
I want it to be at and so the $24 is
gonna put me a little bit higher and I
was like you know I do have this brush
and I love it and it's still in such
good condition it's just one of those
things I'm like I feel like I should
retire this brush because I've had it
for so long but it's still in such good
shape and every time I wash it it's
completely fine it's not falling apart
so I was like so I didn't do it but I'm
not gonna take it off my list yeah no no
I'm not good singer - yeah because I
still I still might do it just because I
feel like I should but that's gonna stay
on that's gonna say I might look I can't
take it off yet no no okay
I was on here the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD invisible cover a stick foundation
for $43 this has been on my love's list
for the longest time and I keep telling
myself I'm gonna buy it because it's
like one of those cult favorites and so
many people absolutely love this
foundation but I just I don't think I'm
ever gonna do it it's been on my list
forever I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and
remove it I haven't tried the the
regular foundation with the pump and
everything the Ultra HD foundation and I
like that foundation just fine I have
two different shades of it but it's not
an absolute favorite of mine I didn't
get like as geeked out about it as I
thought maybe I would so I feel that
kind of goes into me not purchasing the
stick foundation and I'm not a huge fan
of stick foundations I'll say that too
so I think that also comes into play
there
the touch of water cream for $68 let me
just go ahead and remove that yeah okay
so $68 a for a moisturizer is incredibly
pricey now my friend live actually did
send me a little tatcha best sellers kid
I think it was around Christmastime I
want to say which I was so excited about
and I was trying all of the products in
the set and I realized what the water
cream that I like it but I don't
necessarily love it and to spend $68 for
a full sized like that
it's gonna be something that I'm not
gonna do I have other moisturizers that
I'm very loyal to that I repurchase that
I use all the time so to spend a luxury
price for a boy stur Iser
I'm just not gonna do it so I'm gonna go
ahead and remove that these next items I
mean I've had these on my loves list for
ever these are the makeup forever
artists face color highlight sculpt and
blush powder so there are 23 dollars for
a powder product and you can choose
which one you want and they have a bunch
of different shades and finishes and
such and you can also buy a little
palette to go with it and it's actually
a better deal like say you were to
purchase three face powders and then you
would purchase the three pan palette you
actually get a discount on them so I was
really curious about these I have a
contour shade I think it's s1 one two or
something like that
and I ended up getting a 100-point perk
of a blush which is great but what I
realized kind of what this is that I
really enjoy the contour powder I have I
really enjoyed the blush that I have as
a mini so it kind of doesn't make sense
for me to purchase one other face powder
and then purchase the three pan palette
on top of it because they don't go
together so the discount when it applies
on purchasing them each separately
otherwise I can just get the pants but
then I have to put them into my Z
palette and I'd rather make a little
palette it's all confusing and also I'll
say that those are the two shades that I
want the most there's not really any
other shades that really are calling to
me whether it be with the contour blush
or highlight just nothing is really
speaking to me so I've had these on my
loves list for the longest time and I've
gotten in and I've like tried to make
different combinations and it's kind of
one of those things where like I'm I'm
feeling like I'm just putting together a
three pan just because it's a good deal
not necessarily because I need it same
thing you know what I'm saying so I'm
just I'm gonna go ahead and remove that
the huda beauty foe filled our
foundation for $40 I'm gonna go ahead
and take that off my loves list this
would was a thing where maybe it was a
good thing all of the shades sold out so
quickly because I wanted to purchase it
and I remember making a Sephora purchase
like shortly after it came out and
fairly sure because I went to order it
and I was like oh no my shades are sold
not every shade was sold out at that
time but like the majority of shades
were sold out so I didn't do it and they
were constantly sold out constantly sold
out but it's one of those things where I
started watching review videos and like
you know what I don't think I would love
this foundation just hearing what people
are saying now that people are saying is
a bad foundation I think it's pretty
good but it doesn't sound like between
it being like super full coverage and
very mattifying it just doesn't sound
like a foundation that I would enjoy
that would be my personal preference and
a lot of people are saying it smells
really funky which is weird but I'm
gonna go ahead and remove that there's
other foundations that I was much more
interested in I picked up a foundation
in the spill as well so I'm pretty
excited about that I've had on here at
the Marc Jacobs beauty Highliner gel eye
crayon eyeliner for $25 in pink of me is
the shade that I want I mentioned this
in my recommendations in wishlist video
about the Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on
pencils are kind of like surpassing
these Marc Jacobs ones I typically
always recommend the Marc Jacob liners
in my sale videos but in which I said I
would still recommend them but $25 is
very expensive for an eyeliner and I
actually got one and now I can't
remember the shade of it in the Urban
Decay 1 but it looks really similar to
this pink of me from Marc Jacobs so I'm
happy about that so I'm gonna go ahead
and remove that liner so I don't think I
need it anymore oh yes this guy's still
here oh good the Tom Ford bronzer brush
this also was in my products that will
not come home with me
firm of that video the top board bronzer
brush is a hundred and fifteen dollars
for one brush one brush so the reason
it's even on my loves list is because I
hear so many people talking about it and
honestly not even so much anymore I'll
say that because I've watched a quite a
few of these recommendations videos and
I feel like last year watching these
videos somehow this brush was like
sneaking its way into so many different
videos and people are like I know it's
expensive but it's the best brush and
I'm like I want the best brush too so
it's been in my love list but I mean you
girl can't click YES on $115.00 brush
even though I love bronzing and it looks
like a nice brush I was not gonna do it
just constantly sitting here so you know
what bye I don't need you what did they
say but the kids say these days bye
Felicia
I don't even know that means no one has
ever explained that to me explain that
to me what does that mean
who is Felicia I don't we like her
Sephora collection at Sephora Pro born
palette for $68 yeah I just couldn't
never talk myself into this big ol $68
eyeshadow palette from Sephora
collection a lot of people said it was
just like so so yeah dia the hourglass
confession ultra slim high-intensity
refillable lipstick for $34 three or
four dollars for a little teeny little
lipstick girlfriend kids together you're
not buying that that's been on my loves
list forever
get out of here Giorgio Armani luminous
self foundation for $64 again this is
another one of those products that has
just been on my loves us forever when I
was first starting to watch YouTube
videos like everybody was wearing this
and talking about it and raving about it
but it was $64 and that might be the
highest priced foundation that I would
ever purchase I'm looking at my
foundations
I think the Dior at 52 is still my
highest priced foundation so $64 mmm
yeah outta here I haven't even seen that
the whole time thing is it could've on
my catchphrase and then just one more
one more product and then we are done
and we are de cluttered the Urban Decay
Naked skin and weightless altered
definition a liquid foundation for $40
this is one that I just I just have
never gotten myself to buy and I like
Urban Decay one of my favorite brands I
like a lot of their foundations but this
is always one where I think it's one of
those things that like new foundations
come out and I'm like I want to try the
new one I want to try the new one and
this is an older foundation just an
older release that I've just I've never
been able to do so it's been on my list
for a while I'm clearly not gonna buy it
boom removed ah my loveless is so small
now it's looking good it's looking too
cluttered so boom we are done okay so
that is everything for today's the video
decluttering my Sephora loveless kind of
giving you a sneak peak of items that I
decided not to purchase during the VI be
a sale like I said my haul video will be
coming up I did play some orders online
