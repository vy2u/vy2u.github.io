today's video is going to be all about
products that do not make it out of my
Sephora card my Sephora loves list this
video was recently posted by Thalia I
think is how you pronounce her name I
will have her video listed down below
she posted this a few days ago on her
youtube channel and also I had so many
people requesting on Twitter on snapchat
asking me if I would do this video as
well and watch her video and I was like
girl so relatable I understand so that
is what today's video is going to be so
I hope that you will go and check out
her video as well which will be linked
in the description box but if you would
like to see the products that have been
on my Sephora love's list they have made
it into my cart sometimes but I just
cannot click purchase why go ahead and
get started alright so one item that has
been on my love's list for so long I
know this has made it into my cart at
some point too and I just I've never
been able to purchase the full size of
this is from fresh and it's there soy
face cleanser I really enjoyed the space
cleanser I have gone through several
mini sizes of it I actually have a mini
sized in my skincare project pan that
I'm currently working on right now it's
one I love taking traveling with me and
I just for whatever reason I love that
cleanser but I cannot purchase the full
size it's $38 which that is pricey don't
get me wrong but it's not like extreme
crazy like some skincare brands I don't
know I just can't do it and what's so
funny is that I place the Sephora order
on like Black Friday and you could pick
a sample bag and I chose the sample bag
strategically they had a couple
different options in their actual is one
that had a mini in there boom got myself
another mini for when I finished this up
in my project man what does that say
about me I don't know but for some
reason the full size of the fresh a soy
face cleanser I don't think it's ever
coming home with me another item that's
been on my loves us for a very long time
and I've considered it so many times is
the Sephora collection make no mistake
foundation and concealer stick it's 20
dollars and I don't know I have this
thing for a while that I wanted to try
out a bunch of different Sephora
collection makeup products and I've
almost done that video so many times but
you guys want to see that video I don't
let me know I haven't tried a ton of
items from Sephora collection but
there's a few things that have come
tension including this foundation stick
and I have just not been able to
purchase it $20 is not a bad price for a
foundation but I don't know I can't do
it it's it's not making enough my love
sews for whatever reason mm-hmm and then
another one from the Sephora collection
this is their cream lip stain at liquid
lipsticks these are $14 I have had these
are my loves us for quite some time I've
had so many in my cart I was actually a
Sephora store during the vib sale a
couple of weeks ago so I was actually
going to return something and then I was
walking around the store trying to see
if there was anything else I could buy
because I still have the 20% I had one
of these lipsticks in my hand the entire
time walking around the store if you
follow me on snapchat
I shared a photo of my arm it was
covered in lipstick swatches because I
was trying to find the perfect one and I
had it and I was ready to go and there
was a couple other items that I wanted
to pick up and they were out of stock of
both of them and I was like whatever and
I put the lipstick back I don't think
it's ever gonna make it I don't know
what it is I watched Casey Holmes a
swatch video of all of the different
shades at least three times if not more
and actually is like taking notes on the
specific lipsticks I want and for some
reason I can't do it I can't complete
the purchase this next item this next
item is probably never coming home with
me I don't think I will ever hit
purchase on this but you know what it's
sticking right it's just gonna be on my
loves list to remind me you know like
hashtag goals maybe this is from Tom
Ford the bronzer brush it's $115
thunderin $15 for a brush I mean why is
it even on my loves list this is one
that not only has been it's never been
in my cart let me say that it has never
made it into my cart but it's been on my
love's list several times but I've
actually removed it from my love's list
like no guy you don't even put that on
your love's list and then I put it back
on my love so I was like maybe one day
you can justify $115 makeup brush and
then I would take it off but it
currently is on my love Zoe's right now
and it
probably just stay there forever and
look really nice my loves list and never
in my makeup brush collection another
item that I've had out there for quite
some time is from bite Beauty it's the
everyday agave lip mask for I think
these are $26
I hear really amazing things and
everybody is always recommending the
bite Beauty agave lip mask to me and
this is another one that I've kind of
put on my love's list I've taken off I
put it on a take it off I don't think
it's ever actually made it into my cart
I mean it's pretty pricey for $26
actually Thalia might have had this one
on her in her video - I know we had a
couple overlapping once when I was
watching hers and this this might have
been on there and just as kind of pricey
and I really love lip mass I love lip
scrubs I mean I love lip gels I like it
all because I can kind of deal with dry
your lips because I wear liquid
lipsticks a lot but still I don't know
$26 is always seems like a lot I've
actually gotten those sample cards of
them and I want to say I've gotten like
two or three do use those and I enjoy
those and I think they're really nice
but I just I cannot bring myself to
purchase the full-size other item I have
on my love's list that again this is
probably never not even probably let's
just say this is never gonna make it
into my card and into home with me and
this is some more skincare it is from
sk2 the one that I've had on my love's
list is called the welcome kit I don't
know it there it's a set I'm really
attracted to sets I just feel like
they're a good value and a nice way to
try like a variety of products it says
this regimen kit contains SK choose a
signature products to tone treat and
moisturize skin there's a facial
treatment clear lotion which is a skin
toner with a H a there's also the facial
facial treatment essence in SK 2's
highly awarded best seller and there's
also the RNA power cream SK 2's
best-selling anti-aging face cream but
for all three of these it's a hundred
and ten dollars mmm that hurts
I remember hearing about SK - I think
for the first time that I was really
like ooh I should check out that brand
was from desi Perkins I want to say it
was she was using some in her video or
she did a skincare video or something
but she was absolutely raving about SK -
and so that's when I went over to
Sephora and I looked
and then I saw the prices and I was like
hurt it hurts so bad but you know what
it sticks around on my loves this but I
don't think it's ever it's never gonna
come off of that if you keep it rolling
this one's been oh my love so for ever
this is the Sol de Janeiro brazilian
cream every time and like I have said
bum bum cream because that's how it's
spelled and people are like it's boom
boom and then I say boom boom cream and
people are like it's bum bum and I'm
like can we just call it a day because
we know what we're talking about so like
what one of what is going on here this
cream I feel like it gets really mixed
reviews and for some reason that just
like makes me want to try it myself and
just you know so I can like put my
opinion out into the YouTube world to
the YouTube vibes but I feel like
everybody has tried it and maybe that's
what's getting me maybe it's not just
that there's varying opinions but it's
like everybody has an opinion everyone
has tried it except for me but it's $45
and it's like mmm I love love Shannon's
I love body creams I love all of it I've
heard it smells really good it's like
$45 I don't know if I can do that um the
next one I have here is from another
Sephora collection this is the Sephora
Pro warm palette it's an eyeshadow
palette for $68 this palette like haunts
me I know I have mentioned this in past
videos where I talked myself into buying
it I talked myself out of it
I talked myself into buying it I talked
myself out of it and then there's been
times where I'm like definitely getting
that and then it's been out of stock
it's actually currently out of stock as
I'm looking at my love's list right now
so there's been with that one time that
I was like nope doing it out of stock
I'm like did that meant to be is it not
mad at me but Sephora collection came
out with these really thinking huge
eyeshadow pellets like a couple months
ago or so and people kind of went a
little bit crazy for him they have the
warm toned the cool tone and then like
the editorial when I believe the warm
tone definitely reminded me of a Natasha
did not a sunset palette but it was a
little bit cheaper so I was like trying
to decide do you do it do not do it and
again it's one that like sits on my
loves list I look at it from time
time I just don't know what to do about
that one already moving on I have a lip
product here and I thought it was kind
of funny I don't have a ton of lip
products that were on my loves list that
didn't make it home with me because
let's be serious I buy a lot of them I
buy a lot of them I'm a lipstick addict
but this is one that I do not know if
this one will ever come home with me
this is from hourglass it's the
confession ultra slim high-intensity
refillable lipstick these are like the
super super slim I mean it says it in
the name but that really celeb looking
lipsticks but they are $34 and that's
that's that's expensive for a regular
lipstick like not even a liquid lipstick
it's just regular lipstick so $34 that
is quite expensive they released fairly
recently they're not like a new new
release and when they did I was drawn to
them and I even when I was at Sephora a
couple weeks ago during the vib sale I
picked one up and looked longingly at it
and then put it back it didn't even make
it like I wasn't holding it like I was
the Sephora 14 dollar lipstick I didn't
walk around the store that I picked it
up and then I put it right back so not
sure that one will ever make it home for
me if anybody has it if you absolutely
love it it has good it looks like it has
4.5 star reviews on Amazon out of 619
reviews so that's pretty positive so
interesting another item on here that's
been on my love's list since the
beginning of time this is the laura
mercier translucent aloose a setting
powder for $38 everybody has always
raved about this this is everybody's
holy grail this is everybody's
recommended this is everybody's
everything setting powder and I just
have never done it I have purchased the
laura mercier secret brightening powder
I like kind of brighter under eyes and
that's just kind of been my thing for a
while and I like that one just fine and
so I just never really thought I would
need this setting powder but I don't
know it still stays on my loves list
I've kind of gotten away from setting
powders as of recently I think there's a
little bit too much for me and I
typically go for more of like an actual
like pressed powder for under my eyes
and things like that so I don't know if
this one will ever come home with me
about that one that one is one of my
loves list forever another one on here
is from Becca it's the shimmering skin
Perfector in a prison
like amethyst it's a highlight or
highlights are $38 and I know the back
of highlights are fantastic I own so
many of them and I think they are so
good but $38 for one highlight I'm like
oh don't know if I can do it but
prismatic amethyst has had my attention
since it came out like and I think this
one is limited edition but it's a really
cool like purple like iridescent II and
I just I want it so bad but I don't know
I don't know I can't even do it during
the vib sale like 20% off so I feel like
that says that it's probably never
coming home with me but I like it it's
just it's just really expensive
another item very expensive is a
foundation this is the Giorgio Armani
luminous a silk a foundation it's a $64
foundation I have had this one on my
loves list again forever especially when
I first started watching YouTube videos
I feel like this foundation was super
super popular and all of the big gurus
for wearing it always like in every
single tutorial everybody was wearing it
or putting it on raving about it in
favourites videos and I actually got a
sample of it once at Sephora and I mean
this was I can actually remember like
where our guys played slowpitch at and
this must have been at least two if not
three years folks they haven't played at
those fields in a while and I remember
wearing it one night and I looked at
myself in the bathroom mirror at these
slow pitch fields and I was like my face
looks fantastic I'm totally buying this
foundation I love it and then I went to
buy it and it was $64 and I was like no
out of my cart so I don't know if I'll
ever purchase it but I remember I tried
the samples I wore it several times and
I thought it looked really good on my
skin but I haven't been able to to buy
it so there's my story about that and
then the very last item I have on here
is another one from Sephora collection
this is the bright future gel ceramic
concealer I feel like some of these are
my ones I've been on here the longest
this one has been on here for so so long
it's $14 if I didn't say that
for the concealer this one went on my
loves list because Katie or lustre luxe
is seemed to love this at one point I
loved watching her tutorials I've been
watching her for so so long one of my
favorites and at one point she was
continually using this Sephora concealer
and I
it wasn't this past time I was at
Sephora it would have been a while like
at least a year ago I went in and I
found it in store and I looked at it I
had it in my hand I was like just buy a
girl just buy it
I love concealers and trying out new
concealers but nope I still I never was
able to actually purchase that one it
just still sits there on my loves list
like oh girl you know but me nah mine
maybe later not right now so if anyone's
tried that one do let me know but that
is the last item on my Sephora loves
list that have been on for a while that
just have not made it home with me okay
so that is going to do it for today's
video I really hope that you guys
enjoyed seeing it I thought it was such
a fun and just interesting idea and I
had a blast like looking over my love
list and seeing what items have been on
there for so long that I just cannot
make myself purchase I would love to
