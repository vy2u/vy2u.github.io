today's video it's gonna be good ol haul
video I have some orders that I place
with both Ulta and Sephora there was
some nice deals over Memorial Day
weekend I took advantage of it so if you
would like to see what I recently bought
from Sephora and Papa let's go ahead and
get started already my Ulta box I was on
top so I'm gonna go ahead and open this
one first
so the packages came last night but I
was so busy and they came so late that I
literally just cut them open and that
was that I haven't even looked in them
yet so hopefully everything is okay but
I knew I was gonna be filming this haul
video the very next day so I was like
why not okay so the big reason of why I
decided to place an order from altas
because they were having their gorgeous
hair event I think it's what it's called
and every single day there's like
another hot by with hair and one day
they were having a sale on the batiste
dry shampoo I was just talking about
wanting to try out the batiste dry
shampoo in my minis my mini wishlist
video and I said I was gonna get a
little mini of matisse to try it out but
they were having the clean and classic
original on sale for like it would have
been the same price to get the full size
as it would to get the mini I have the
packing slip right here oh it doesn't
say her price on it that's helpful I
think it was like $4 or something on the
sale so I was like I'm just gonna go
ahead and get it so I've got the batiste
dry shampoo I'm super excited about that
of course with my hauls I'll come back
in a couple weeks and give updates you
know check my Instagram I'll probably be
doing tutorials here and there with some
of the items that I'm getting but I will
come back in a couple weeks here and
give my thoughts on everything that I
ordered I also was really excited that's
kind of just waiting for you know a
boost to purchase something from Ulta
because I really really want this
product and it was finally being cared
at all carried at Ulta it is from morphe
it is their continuous a setting mist I
have wanted to try this setting spray
for the longest time and I finally
finally got it so many people say such
good things whew try see if it had a
smell you know it does it smells good so
many people say great things about this
they say it's a glue for your makeup
they love the like aerosol spray on it
I finally got it hasn't been available
at Ulta it's only been on the marquee
website and now that Murphy said I'll
town like I want to shop at Ulta I want
my points on my rewards and and all of
that so I was just kind of like waiting
for that okay I also got this is a
repurchase this is from L'Oreal I
finally finally am getting another True
Match Lumi a foundation this is one of
my all-time favorite foundations I ran
out of it it was probably like close to
last summer late last summer or
something like that
I wanted to repurchase it but I was like
get through some of your foundations
first I didn't do a great job about that
but I really wanted this foundation I
was like you know what I'm just gonna
buy it because his I especially loved
this foundation in the summer it's a
Lumi foundation and I don't deal with
dryness as bad in the summer but still
something about this this was my go-to
foundation last summer so I really
wanted to repurchase another one I did
pick up the shade what is it and four
which is buff beige so it's supposed to
be neutral a neutral undertone so
hopefully this will be pretty good it
also does have SPF 20 in it which i
think is great but one of my favorite
foundations like one of my favorite
drugstore foundations but one of my
favorite drugs one of my favorite
foundations in general you get what I'm
saying this is my second video I filmed
today the first one was the challenge
that went up on Friday so here I am
looking a little different from that
video okay I was also really excited
because this was another item that was
on at my mini wishlist and it is the
Laura Geller highlighter and this is in
gilded honey so this is the little mini
it was $12 I know a bunch of people were
tagging me that Laura Geller was on sale
as well the original highlights but it
was still like I can't remember what
they were on sale for was it like
seventeen dollars or fourteen dollars or
something like that so it's still gonna
be more than the mini and honestly like
I'm fine with the mini like like I said
in the mini wishlist video I don't hit
pan on things like I just don't I don't
go through highlights so I'm like truly
I am fine just getting the mini so
there's a swatch of gilded honey oh I
have some swatches on my hand from my
prior video still cuz that's the way
roll that looks so beautiful oh I feel
like I'm gonna like this one so much I'm
so excited to finally get this oh yeah
okay and then the last item that I
ordered from Ulta honestly I was like
eight dollars away from free shipping
which I'm sorry if you are like a
platinum member at Ulta I don't think
you should have to pay for shipping like
that's something that I feel like
Sephora does a better job at but I was
like eight dollars away from shipping
cuz I also had a coupon so it took money
off so I decided to purchase this
because I feel like people have said
this is a really good concealer but I
also don't hear a ton a ton about it so
I wanted to try it myself
it's from the uLTA Beauty line and it's
their full coverage liquid concealer
it's a waterproof concealer I think it
was like nine dollars so it hit the mark
perfectly for me for the free shipping
and it's something that I've wanted to
try out and I mostly have high-end
concealers in my collection so I try to
make sure I have a good balance of
drugstore as well so I'm excited I got
the shade light neutral we will see how
it goes hopefully it's not too late I'm
not a hundred percent but I feel like
people have said good things about this
and I don't try a ton from the uLTA
Beauty line so I will give that one a
try and see what I think ready then
moving over to my Sephora box we got the
nice round papers that they use to
protect all of my pricey pricey items
that I bought thank you so much Sephora
okay so a first step I decided to get
this and it's open so that's a little
dangerous this is from Urban Decay it is
the all nighter a long wear mattifying
weightless setting powder waterproof
setting powder it's a setting powder
okay alright so here is what it looks
like
hopefully it's not okay it looks good
looks good like I said I haven't opened
anything yet so it's hoping it came to
me okay alrighty
mmm today girl so I went back and forth
on this for a while so Alto was kind of
having some of their hot buys a couple
things were discounted I wanted to make
a purchase from Sephora because II
weights was eight percent cash back and
I was like when it went so far is that
eight percent cash back that's when I
typically will buy you know you save
things in your Lovelace Lovelace and you
wait up to buy something then when it
weights
stay first I'm I'm like okay feel better
now because basically it's you're
getting a percent off that's how I look
at it so you guys haven't joining bites
yet what are you waiting for
so I kept going back and forth on this I
was like I don't know I don't know and
then finally I decided to do it
the reason being why I wasn't sure is
because it also just bought the
Charlotte Tilbury her airbrush flawless
powder so I was like do I really need
another setting powder but it could be a
good thing to compare because a lot of
people are already asking me about
Charlotte Tilbury I do have that powder
today over the urban take it one and
done actually so that's kind of funny a
lot of people are asking me about that
so I thought I could compare them
because they're both a pricey I think
this is 34 Charlotte Tilbury is 45 and
you can get Charlotte Tilbury on Beauty
lish so I thought I could compare them
to let you guys know which one I would
recommend so that's that's how I talked
myself into it okay so it's this isn't
for me this is for you you are welcome
but we will see what I think about this
I really did want to try to put in a
will I buy a video and I was pretty
excited for it I like a lot of urban
decay products so I decided we're gonna
give it a shot okay I also decided to
get food this was an item that was also
for sale in alta but because before i
was having the 8 percent cashback and
also is only 2.5 percent cashback or
something like that i actually picked it
up from sephora it is the Anasazi
Beverly Hills blush trio I totally don't
need this item oh you know and another
reason obviously I was getting some
deals and discounts I'll probably do
another collective haul here because I
ordered a couple more like lifestyle
things too like Sundays and things like
that so I'll probably do that one coming
up but also last weekend was my book
release and it was so it was so beyond
anything that I could have imagined
and I just felt like I was like so
excited all weekend and I was like you
know what just do minute shopping
because book release time was super
stressful on Amazon actually the two
days before the book was gonna go live
they actually told me that they wouldn't
publish my book because they couldn't
verify I owned the publishing rights to
my book
only where they're not going to publish
my new book they were going to terminate
my entire account and take all my books
down so two days before I'm supposed to
release and I have everything ready to
go and everything set I'm on the phone
with Amazon like what are you talking
about because obviously I'm on the
rights
I own the copyright I owned my LLC which
the books are registered on there I'm
like what we got it figured out Thursday
night and so it was a very stressful
time so you know it's like you know
point I just serve this like I've put a
lot of into that book people seem
excited about it it seems to be going
well and I went through a lot of stress
also that week we lost our internet
monday through wednesday a book release
week we get our internet back in our
later I get the email from Amazon
we won't publish your book I'm like why
why does everybody hate me right now so
it needless to say I felt like I
deserved to do that little bit of
shopping okay so I got Anastasio blush
trio now that we like we can justify
anything right we can justify anything
so this is the blush a trio in a pool
party there you are originally in the
thirty dollar range and it was on sale
for twenty-one and this is the blush
trio and pool party from anastacio I
like that it has a mirror I like the
packaging I hope I hope that I like it
but I feel like people have been saying
good things about it so when I saw they
were going on sale I was like I'm just
gonna try it you know eight percent I
was like let's just do it okay so I also
got my finally from Hooda Beauty the
coral obsessions eyeshadow palette I
have been wanting this for quite some
time but I was just waiting you know as
casually casually waiting for some sort
of deal to happen whether it be like
Sephora slips this uh coupon which does
not happen very often or you Bates does
double cash back and I get eight percent
these pellets are twenty seven dollars
and I really really like the hood beauty
pellets this is now my fourth palette I
talked about this one in a boy buy it
video and I said I really really wanted
it so I'm really feeling this so that is
pretty beautiful I love these palettes
who are traveling I think that they're
so handy and this is just a color scheme
that I really like
so we'll go ahead
that one out all right what else did
they get oh this is another one from my
minis wishlist I got the Natasha J Nona
blush and glow a little mini guy so
these are $19 so here is what she looks
like so you know it is very small and I
knew that oh it's so cute
okay that's honestly the pan sizes are
not as small as I was expecting I mean I
truly was expecting smaller I mean the
packaging is very mirrored so it's
probably hard to see but honestly I was
expecting way smaller so those are the
swatches there of the highlight and then
also the blush so I'm really excited to
try this out again I don't like the or I
don't mind the minis I don't mind the
small palettes because I'm very light
handed and I'm rarely rarely hitting pan
on anything so I'm excited to give this
a try and see what I think oh yeah okay
so and then the last item that I got was
actually one of the what do they call it
bonus offers where you put in the code
and it is for the milk makeup cushion
mascara I also talked about this in a
while about video and I said I really
wanted to try out this mascara so once I
saw that I could get it with one of the
codes I was like perfect so that is what
I got so I'm excited to try out this
mascara and see what I think I feel like
it's been getting pretty good reviews
there's what the wand looks like I feel
like it's been getting pretty good
reviews so I'm excited to test it out so
yeah I always go through those two bonus
offers and see if there's anything that
I want to grab and when I saw this I was
like perfect but I wanted to try it out
I would rather get a mini mascara try it
out and see what I think before getting
the full size so perfect - but after
that does everything that from my latest
makeup all okay so that is everything
for my most recent makeup haul for my
orders from both of Sephora and Ulta I
hope you enjoyed seeing what I picked up
let me know what you thought about the
items that I decided to purchase again I
will come back in a couple weeks here so
I can review everything that I picked up
and I'm excited to test these out but I
hope you guys enjoyed it seeing a haul
