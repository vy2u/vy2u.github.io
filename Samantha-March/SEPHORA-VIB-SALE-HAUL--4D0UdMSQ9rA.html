excited for today's video because I'm
going to be sharing my Sephora vib sale
huh it's finally the time to share when
I picked up it during the vib sale so if
you are curious what I picked up why
don't we go ahead and get started with
the haul
so first up I'm actually gonna talk
about a product that I ended up
returning so I no longer have it with me
if you guys follow me on Instagram I did
post a photo of a Natasha Damona
eyeshadow palette that unfortunately got
to to me broken so I'll insert the photo
here that I took and I shared on my
Instagram I didn't purchase her holiday
palettes for some reason they weren't
really calling to me and I know that it
said it was a new formula and I don't
want to try a new Natasha generic
formula I wanted to try the one that
everybody raves about that everybody
says is fantastic so I went with one of
her like original regular 5 pan palettes
and I chose this one because it has the
purple shades in there and I've learnt
purple today I really love purple with
green eyes it's a color that I gravitate
towards quite a bit so I decided to go
with that one's a friendly try out the
Natasha to know in a formula it's $48
even for just a 5 pan eyeshadow palette
and Tasha did Nona's pretty pricey
and I was so disappointed when I opened
it up and saw that one of the shades was
shattered so I already went and returned
it I'm actually the day that I got my
order in I was going to our mall to
watch a movie with my girlfriend's that
night was a bad mom's too so I was like
I'll just go a little bit early and
return the palette and they said they
didn't even have that one in store like
they couldn't even do in exchange and I
was like you know what it's fine like
just give me my money back it's you know
it took me a lot to decide to get a
Natasha - no no palette because they are
so pricey and when it came to shattered
I was like you know what it's fine it's
just meant to be we we are not meant to
be together but actually the next week I
went into the Sephora store again with
the sale was starting again for Rouge I
actually went in store because maybe my
husband or at the mall doing some
holiday shopping and they had her
holiday palettes in there and then also
the sunset palette and i swatched the
palettes and I really was not all that
impressed and I kept her
tell myself I was like well maybe it's
just because other people have swatch it
you know it's not like a brand new
palette you know I can't really set my
expectations too high and that sort of
thing but they also had the visor warm
Matt's palette in there and i swatched
that and even though you could tell that
had been swatched over a bajillion times
that blew me away so I thought that was
kind of interesting try and I tried I
tried him with a Natasha - no no we
clearly weren't meant to be together so
I just went ahead and return that one
alrighty so I also decided to pick up a
foundation this one is from a Dior this
is the Dior forever skin foundation I
mentioned this one in my ageless and
recommendations video I was between this
one and the huda beauty foundation but
that one is like sold out in every
single color so I could not get that one
so I went ahead with this d'art one it
is at $50 for the forever foundation it
does have a nice pump on it it seems
like a pretty a nice foundation you get
your one fluid ounce I'm excited to try
this out I actually did post this on my
Instagram and a lot of people were
saying how much they love this
foundation as well so I'm excited to
give this one a try and see how I like
it
I also decided to pick up the offending
Beauty glossa balm the universal lip
Luminizer I think I mentioned this one
in my wish list of video as well as
trying to decide if I should get it or
not it's $18 for a lip gloss but I see
so many good reviews about this one and
a lot of people really talk it up so I
thought during the sale would be a good
time to give it a try oh it does have
quite a house like a fruitier I want to
say juicy juicy scent - I don't know if
that makes any sense there's a little
swatch of it is they lip gloss but that
is pretty pigmented it's supposed to
feel like really universally flattering
on a lot of people I've seen a lot of
good reviews about it so I thought I
would give it a try I know lip gloss is
like supposed to be trending and stuff
I'm not really a lipgloss person but I'm
trying so I'll see what I think of the
efendi beauty so I also did a pink of
the lip set from who - beauty this is
the nude love collection at the liquid
matte minis I'm so excited I've been
waiting for this collection to comment
to Sephora I love buying the hooda minis
I mean I feel
many lipsticks are just fantastic
anyways especially if you're someone
like me who has a huge lipstick
collection it's like impossible to get
their lipsticks I see no issue buying
little minis so the shades in here are
crush girlfriend white feet and sugar
mama $33 for the four minis and I think
a regular liquid lipstick from hooter is
20 so I thought that that was an awesome
deal so I will go ahead and swatch these
so the first one here is in white feet
there is white V of course it is a
liquid lipstick so it will be drying I
do have to have my ring light on today
because it is very dark outside
unfortunately so this next one is in
girlfriend which I await now I own
girlfriends so I'm not gonna swatch this
one that would have been bad so I do own
girlfriend in the full-size so I'll go
ahead and swatch my full-size because I
can always give girlfriend away if I
decide that I don't want to keep the
mini but there is girlfriend compared to
white feet and then next up we have a
sugar mama these are just all they're
just all my tone so that last one there
is a sugar mama and then the final one
is crush and it's definitely more pinky
so we have wifey girlfriend sugar mama
and crush from who - Beauty I'm excited
to have four new minis I love the huda
beauty it look what lipstick formula
it's one of my favorites I thought I got
four more nudes
what a good day also from huda beauty I
picked up a new pair of her lashes these
are in number 12 which is Farrah I don't
know if you notice we were puppy-sitting
the other day in the puppy I guess
decided that she wanted some lashes too
so she got a hold of a most like
eyelashes why but I thought I mean the
end sing wearing a Farrah's in one of
her recent videos and I just thought
that they were so beautiful so I added
them to my loves list and think you look
very gorgeous so I think these ones were
$23 I also have her at Samantha lashes
which I really love so I'm excited to
try out a new style so this is a little
random but I saw so many people
recommending this in their support of
the IB scale recommendation videos these
are from I should say though and they
are
the facial Cotton's you know so many
people were recommending them if you
guys have used them to let me know but I
feel like you've got a lot I can't
remember us now this whole thing was $10
and I feel like you got a lot of
different paths in here and then a lot
of people are saying to actually cut
them in half and you can like double
your usage so if they're just supposed
to be like really good so I had to give
it a try for myself please let me know
what you think so I was not gonna pick
up any skin care during the sale and I
even did a live vib sale anti column
before the sale started and everyone was
asking me about skin care and I was like
you know what I'm not gonna do it I'm
trying to use up my skin care and really
happy with everything that I have and I
have a ton of skin care because that's
one of my weaknesses so I was like not
gonna do it and then I watched my friend
live from the live loves her makeup and
she recommended this set and I was like
thank you so much thank you for doing
that cuz I ruined I ruined my anti haul
of not buying any skincare so this is
from Allah Hendrickson it's the three
glowing scrubs so it's a mini scrub a
trio I think one of the reasons I was
most drawn to this it's because I've
been trying this brain more and more
lately I used one of their cleansers and
it's one of my favorites I've been
trying their truth serum
their moisturizer I've been trying a lot
from this brain and I've been really
happy with it and I happened wanting to
pick up more products from them when I
saw this trio I was like I'm just gonna
do it so it comes with the transforming
walnut scrub but the poor balance of
facial sauna scrub which actually that
has been on my loves list for a really
long time and that's another reason why
I decided to get this set so I can make
sure I like it and then purchase the
full-size if I want to also be
transforming almond facial polish I
can't remember now how much exactly this
was like 20 or 25 dollars I can put it
on the screen here if anything it was
about twice for three minutes
especially scrubs because I know it'll
take me a while to get through them too
but I've been wanting to try out more
from the brand I've had my eye on the
green one in the middle here for quite
some time so I'm excited to have more
thank you live for the recommendation
next up I want to talk about something
that I actually haven't received yet so
I did place my first order the day that
the sale started for Rouge but we
actually got the shop twice so what I
did was that I placed an order for
everything that I really really wanted
knew I wanted to get and
there was a couple items in there that I
was like I'm not a hundred percent yet
so I said place your order and then if
you still want it when you know Rouge
starts again
then you can go ahead and get it but
that's how I decided to do it and when
the next week came around I still really
wanted this pair of lashes in particular
so I went ahead and ordered the blinking
beaut I believe they're called the bomb
basket lashes my package is set to
arrive today the day that I'm filming
which is Monday but I didn't want to
wait too long because sometimes they
don't come until later at night because
I do need to get those edit it and up
and ready to go for the morning in hell
of that so I'm excited for when they
finally come in because I tried a
blinking beaut for the first time once
they came to support they're kind of a
newer brand to Sephora believe they just
came in there a couple months ago and I
picked up the Coquette lashes and I
really really liked them and so I
decided to order another pair of balm
busk
the reason I was kind of on the fence
about them is because they are $25 for
lashes that's even more expensive than
the hooda lashes so I just thought it
was pretty pricey but with the 20% off
you know every little bit helps and all
of that
even though who else notice that eBay
it's played us during the sale not very
impressive that anybody else because
usually Sephora is at least 4% back at
eBay like I've never seen Sephora lower
than 4% and during the vib sale it's
been at 2.5% and I like interesting
anyways that's a whole different story
but you know of course I've every little
bit helps even only 2.5 percent cash
back at eBay
so I decided to go ahead and place
another order I'm such a lash lover and
I feel like lashes are something because
I go through them you know I wear them a
ton of times I wash my lashes I take
really good care of them
I wear them a ton but it's also kind of
a gratifying feeling when you do go
through your lashes and I feel like
that's why another reason why I don't
have a problem buying them and buying
more expensive ones because I wear them
the majority of the time I don't have
them on today I've been dealing with a
cold the past couple days that I just
don't don't feel my best and I know I'm
going to
take hot shower after this though I
didn't put my lashes on today but I did
pick those up so I'll have the photo
inserted in here enough of course I'll
link them down below but I'm very
excited to try a new pair from a
blinking Butte did pick up a little
100-point perk of skincare as well this
is from Sunday Riley it's the CEO I saw
a bunch of people recommending this in a
whole bunch of Sunday Riley of course
because San Gabriel is really expensive
I saw a lot of people mentioning that in
their recommendation videos so when I
saw this was a 100-point perk I was like
I'll go ahead and get I have so many
support points and like nothing to ever
use them on cuz Sephora rewards are
hello so just a little guy here a little
100-point perk I thought I would try it
out and try to use up some of my points
and you guys have tried the CEO from a
Sunday Riley let me know but figured I'd
give it a shot
righty I finally finally got it the
Tarte tartlet toasted palette oh yes
I've been waiting and waiting
I mentioned this palette in a will I buy
a video and I said I was so excited to
get it and I was gonna order it on the
Tarte website right away and then I kind
of explained myself I think it wasn't
another will I buy a video of why I
hadn't gotten it right away and where my
review was because Tarte had some sort
of like funky security thing on their
website and I got a little spooked like
a credit card numbers are being given
out to random people and like shipping
out dresses and stuff so I weighed it
and you know what I did and then it was
on Safari and it was 20% off so hey it
was all good but I do friendly have the
toasted palate so I'm really excited to
give this one a try this is just you
know like my type of eyeshadow palette I
love the warm tones so just makes a
sense of for me and I'm pretty pumped to
let me know what you guys want to see
with this I was thinking about maybe I
don't have anything in mind yet for
Friday's video I usually either do like
a flashback Friday for Friday videos or
I do some sort of like trying makeup
first impressions makeup tutorial
something like that would you want to
see a first impression using some of
these items from the vib sale we could
try everything on together so I kind of
been waiting to dip into everything
until I did my haul video mostly so I
don't like lose any think I've had it in
one little nice corner waiting to do
this video so if you do want to see
something like that let me know because
I could use the toasted eyeshadow
palette sorry that mirror
like so blinding I don't know what to do
about it but really gorgeous I'm excited
to play with it so let me know your
thoughts if you'd want to see a video
like that or any other type of video
with some of these items that from at
the hall but finally gather alright and
then the last item that I picked up
actually I purchased from Ulta because
it's not available at Sephora yet but I
thought I would put it in here just to
show you guys umm is from Tarte and it
is the park app at princess contour
palette I did notice that Tarte said
that it is coming soon at to Sephora so
I didn't see an exact date but I saw it
they commented back to someone on their
Instagram and so that will be coming to
Sephora so I'm not sure when but I
wanted it I mentioned it in a will I buy
a video and I was super stoked to get it
so I didn't want to wait and I have a
ton of points at Ulta so it ended up not
even costing me anything which was
awesome so well you know you know I
sometimes I say that and I'm like well
you know we got those points because we
spent money so it's not necessarily free
but you know what I mean I was really
excited
I love face palettes I'm obsessed with
them I don't I don't know what to say
like I want to own all of the face
palettes basically so inside we have
just a variety of different shades and
I'm just stoked to try this out and see
what I think of it I think it's
beautiful oh my like it's heavy it's
heavy duty the packaging is no joke on
it has a beautiful mirror so I'm excited
to try out these shades I think they
could work as I and fascias but I mean a
lot of different things can but like I
see my perfect contour shade I see a
good bronzer shade in here so I'm
excited to try it out again if you'd
want to see the first impressions video
I can for sure use this as my face
palette it was a $46 it's called the
parka princess chisel palette is the
full name for it but yeah I was so
excited to get this one I could not wait
for it to come to Sephora you've all the
points for it and I hope I don't regret
it we shall see
okay so after that that's gonna be
everything that I picked up at during
the Sephora VIP sales haul I hope that
you guys enjoyed seeing my haul and all
the items that I picked up let me know
what you thought of everything that I
got in the comments down below what did
you pick up what are you most excited
for have you had to return anything I've
actually heard a lot of people are
getting up their items broken because
the packaging isn't great I mean when my
package came personally it had bubble
wrap on the bottom and then everything
stacked on top of that and then that
like brown piece of paper was over it so
I was pretty bummed to get a broken
Natacha don't know on a pallet but a lot
of people are saying they're Natasha's
no notice are coming broken I've seen a
lot of glow kids are coming broken but
just a lot of pallets in general are
coming broken from the vib sale so that
is a bummer so let me know in the
comments of anything of yours came
broken as well that's other than that
and that's going to do it for today's
video I hope that you guys enjoyed seen
the hull let's have a video you'd want

at during the sale and of course if you
