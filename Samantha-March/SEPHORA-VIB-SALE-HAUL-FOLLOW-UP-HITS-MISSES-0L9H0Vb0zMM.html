today's video is going to be my Sephora
vib sale haul follow-up video so I have
reviews for everything that I purchased
her in the support vib sale
I've been trying them out like crazy so
I can get you a video up today it's
going to be so if you would like to see
my reviews my hits and misses from the
Sephora vib sale haul why we go ahead
and get started so I will have my
Sephora VAV self haul video a link down
below of course and then I also did a
Tryon video of it as well
testing out a bunch of the products in
there I think it was a first impression
video so I'll have the unlisted down
below as well but a lot of people said
they would want to see like a try on
haul style as well so I did that and
then I have been trying everything out I
have most of these items on my face as
well that's what I tried to do today and
so I'm just going to jump into it with
the foundation that I picked up and this
is from Dior this is the Dior skin
forever foundation and I picked mine up
in the shade zero three zero I really
like this foundation and when I was
doing the first impressions video like
you saw my face like as I was just kind
of like casually swiping it on with the
brush I was like oh my skin is looking
really nice and I was like you know I
don't get too excited though you guys
see how it lasts throughout the day you
guys see the wear time you gotta try it
again you gotta try it let the Beauty
sponge you gotta try it with a different
brush like oh there's lots of different
things that you got to do with this
foundation so don't get too hyped yet
you know bots still hyped still hyped
over here so that is fantastic whenever
I wear this foundation I love how my
skin looks and it's like it's so funny
because even if I do my eye shadow and I
feel like I'm not like on my eyeshadow
game that day I'm like doesn't even
matter because my face looks so freakin
nice is a $50 foundation so it is pretty
pretty pricy of horror foundation but I
absolutely love it you do get the 1
fluid ounce and it does have a pump I
have had no complaints with this
foundation I mean I like applying it
with a brush and I like applying it with
a Beauty Blender I think either way is
fine some foundations like one works
better than the other I think either way
is totally fine I do like to use and you
know I've tried different primers with
it as well I like to use something
that's maybe a little bit more hydrating
it feels just like a touch on the dry
side so if you have really dry skin this
be something that might not be the best
for you or if you can combat it what
they really like moisturizing or
hydrating primer it might be better it
doesn't bother me a ton but I've just
realized if I just use a hydrating or
moisturizing primer it's totally fine no
big deal so if you have a dry skin maybe
be aware of that one that's really the
only con that I could come up with this
one really nice foundation turned into a
favorite super happy about that so I
also picked up a gloss during the sale
and I picked up the Effendi Beauty
palasa balm this is $18 and I bought it
because I just saw so many good reviews
on it and everybody was saying how
beautiful it was and you know everybody
needs this gloss I'm like eighteen
dollars from lip gloss though you know
it's kind of pricey but I was like okay
I'm gonna do it because everybody is
raving about it so I'm just gonna go
ahead and do it I have it on today I
have it on underneath the lipstick that
I'll talk about and a bit here as well
so I have it on I've worn it in past
videos you know I've I've worn it alone
if worn it over lipsticks I've worn it
over liquid lipsticks you know I'm just
trying to get a feel for it and what I
think of it and what do I think of it I
think it's fine but I guess I don't
understand the hype around it because to
me it's a clear lip gloss and when I did
my first impressions video I tried it on
first because I was like it looks like
it has a nice pigment in here right like
I don't know to me it looks like it has
some sort of something in here it's not
just a clear gloss to me on me it's a
clear gloss I know they say this is
supposed to be like a universally
flattering shade so around maybe pulls
different on other people to me it's a
straight clear gloss and I was really
hoping for just something like some sort
of mmm-hmm you know and even like if I
look close like it looks like it has
some sort of like maybe gold shimmer in
it I don't see that at all I don't see
it when I put it on my lips over a
lipstick I don't see it when I put it on
with no lipstick so I'm like what what
did I do wrong and why don't I see the
hype
I considered returning it because it's
an $18 lip gloss and I just don't get
what the hype is but I don't know I
might keep it around I like the smell of
it I mean it's it's a nice looking gloss
but to me it's just a plain
lipgloss than $18 on I don't know what
do you guys have it what do you think of
it it just to me wasn't anything special
and there's a lot of other clear glasses
out there like I really like the NYX
butter glosses and I know those are not
$18 so I don't know this one was a bit
of a letdown to me just cuz I feel like
it had been so hyped up and I I don't
think it's bad but I don't get why all
the hypose around it the lips like that
I'm wearing I picked up a hooter beauty
lipstick said this is her nude lipstick
set and it has four mini nude lipsticks
in here I will insert a swatch photo in
here if you'd like to see some swatches
I believe I also watched it in the haul
video as well I have been trying these
out alike crazy I love the hood of
beauty liquid lipsticks they're one of
my favorite formulas I know they're
definitely not for everybody to me
they're a really unique formula I don't
feel like I have a lot like the huda
beauty lipsticks they're very very thin
they're a bit watery you don't need to
use a lot of product with this one and
it just you know it spreads really
easily over the lips with very little
product because of how the formula is
and I think it's very long-lasting I
think I own I already know like seven or
eight maybe of her liquid lipsticks now
I've purchased every single one myself
I've bought singles I've bought sets and
I just love them thar one of my
favorites so for this particular set you
got four of the mini lipsticks for $33
which I don't think is a bad price at
all the shades inside our crush wifey
sugar mama which is on my lips today and
then girlfriend girlfriend I actually do
on it full size of this one as well but
the other three were all new to me and I
love every single shade like I said
sugar mamas on my lips today crush I
absolutely love it is a beautiful like
very pale pink and I thought it was
going to be too light on me but the
first time I used it I was like oh I
love this lipstick I've been doing a ton
of different tutorials over on my
Instagram which is where I do most of
like my makeup looks and makeup
tutorials and you just saw me kind of
like move down the line from these
lipsticks because I wanted to try out
all of them and there's there's not one
in here that I dislike if you are a huge
nude lipstick fan I think that you would
absolutely love this set I know if
you're not a nude lipstick lover fan
you'll probably be thinking like those
all look really similar but they all
look different enough on the lips all
two nude lipstick lovers they'll get it
like you're like yeah those are really
similar but they're different but
they're different the nude lipstick
lovers get it and I get it I love all
four of these I'm super happy to add
three more new ones to my collection but
yeah this set this set has made me very
happy
from who WD I purchased some lashes so I
do own her lashes in Samantha there was
some of my favorite lashes and ivory
purchased them several times over I
don't really three or four times maybe I
need to try out another style from her
and I decided to pick up the fara and
number twelve lashes so those are what
her lash box looks like and then I have
the number twelve lashes in here now
these are a little bit different from
the Samantha lashes the Samantha lashes
are considered a classic lash and there
are $20 the feral lashes are considered
the faux mink lashes and these are $23
so they're more expensive and I
unfortunately really did not like these
lashes which surprised me because of how
much I love the Samantha lashes I just
assumed they would be really similar but
unfortunately the band is super thick
and super like stiff it is really really
hard to make this band work on the eyes
and to kind of have it fit the eye shape
I mean we all have a different eye shape
but it's just incredibly hard to make it
fit on there and I think I actually used
these in the first impression video and
you heard me say in the video I feel
like this band is thicker than the
Samantha lashes but if I was like no no
you know it must not be but then I went
over and I tried the Samantha lashes a
couple days later and I was like no the
bands are definitely very different and
even just the lashes in general are
different lashes are like stiff and hard
and they don't feel natural and I don't
really feel like they will look all that
natural on the eyes and I know we're
talking about false lashes they're not
really the most natural things in the
world anyways but I just feel like it
looked really obvious it's really hard
to hide the band you definitely have to
wear eyeliner with these what the
Samantha lashes I think that you should
wear eyeliner too there's a lot of
lashes though where the band is more
natural looking and you can get away
with not wearing any eyeliner with it
like I have on today but these ones like
you have to have eyeliner and it's just
hard I mean if you guys follow me on
snapchat you know I was struggling with
lashes for a while and I kept trying to
make these work and I kept trying to
make these work because I really wanted
to like them but unfortunately these are
not gonna be my favorites I will
not repurchase these that don't
recommend them and I don't think I would
purchase anything from the faux mink
collection from Kota Beauty because I
don't know they're just the band the
lashes everything about them I don't
really like them at all I do like the
classic lashes but unfortunately this
collection just did not do it for me so
wanted to love these but these are miss
for me and at $23 dozen expensive miss
alright let's move over to what you guys
have really came to this video for the
one item that I know you guys wanted to
see me review oh yeah it's the Sato
facial cause I have you been waiting to
see my review for this okay so I bought
these because everybody was recommending
them and in all the support
recommendation videos people were like
these are my favorite facial Cotton's
but I always purchase them during the
vib smell cuz they're so expensive above
I kept seeing everybody saying that and
I was like you're gonna order them
aren't you girl yep sure did
so it is $10 and you get I think it's
165 a different path in here which I
don't know how do when you break it down
I really didn't think it was like all
that terrible like I understand it's
expensive for cotton when people are
like it is so expensive I was like puffs
gonna be like 25 30 50 dollars and then
when I saw 10 I was like that's not that
bad no I guess 20% off eight I mean
eight isn't that terrible
cuz this is a lie and I don't use them
every single night or every single day
so I'll have these aroung for quite some
time well what do I think about them I
think there's a bomb I do
I love these I really don't even feel
like I've used that many either but I
really enjoyed these I get what people
are talking about though it's just a
little cotton pad like this and some
people even said that they actually cut
them in half but I'm not going to I
think this is a pretty good size for me
but I like it because one thing that I
think it does differently than the other
like regular cotton pads that I get or
cotton balls that I use is that when I
pump something onto here whether it be
you know a cleanser whether it be my
makeup remover liquid whatever it is it
doesn't sink into the cotton
and then you know and then I'm using
more product that way I can see that it
sits on top of it so when I go to put it
on my face I'm actually distributing
more product on my face instead of it
sinking into the cotton which I was like
okay first plus and then when I move it
around I have not had one sheet fall
apart on me there's the note cotton that
left on my face and a little like linty
things on my face which is fantastic
because there are times where I get like
the cotton buff stuck in my eyelashes
and I'm just like that's not cool so I
really appreciate that so I love using
these to remove my makeup I've been
reaching for them so much but another
really good use I found for them is
removing nail polish okay also really
good at removing nail polish because
again I would just use like a regular
cotton ball to remove my nail polish and
as you're removing it little fibers of
the cotton bubble are getting stuck on
your nails so then you have to get out
another cotton ball put more nail polish
remover on that one
to take off the nail polish and the
offending cotton that is now stuck on
your nails like it's time for that not
me anymore I'm not gonna waste my time
doing that because one pad takes it all
off and nothing gets stuck on my nails
boom totally worth it not mad at all
that I purchased these not mad at all so
next I might have a some as skin care I
purchased a little trio sent from Allah
Hendrickson and I was really excited to
try these out so this is the one that
I've put in at my shower so far so this
is really the only one that I can review
the other ones are the transforming
almond facial polish and the
transforming walnuts to krub so I will
be trying them out when I run out of
this one this is the pore balance a
facial sauna scrub and I love this I
love this scrub I will purchase the full
size of this one I feel like I'm
actually almost out of it I use it in my
shower so much I don't I don't wash my
hair every time I take a shower I only
wash my hair like twice a week or so and
the days that I wash my hair are the
days that I use whatever's in my shower
scrub a mask and exfoliator so that is
when I've been using it but there's
actually been days where I just go in
there to rinse
after my workout and I'm like I'm just
gonna just gonna reach for this scrub
because I love it that much it's a
really really cool house called the
sauna scrub when I squeeze it out onto
my fingers it feels like hot and then
when I rub my fingers together it
honestly feels not like hot like it
hurts me but it's not above warm and
then when you start to put it on your
face it is so warm and like luxurious
and it smells so nice and I feel like
I'm at a spa and then I leave it sit for
a while and I'll like put conditioner in
my hair things like that and over time
as it sits on the face it turns to like
a cooling effect I love this stuff I
think it is bomb I'm super happy with
this and I would totally most definitely
repurchase the full size of this one you
want to try these two out also to see if
you know maybe there's one that I like
absolutely love more but I don't know
that one's gonna be hard to beat but I
will be trying these minis also but this
little set was 25 dollars which I don't
think is a bad price at all so the other
pair of lashes that I had to chat about
are the ones I'm wearing today these are
from uplinking and beauty and these are
the bombastic lashes I have another set
of lashes they're called the Coquette
lashes from blinking beauty I got them
shortly after they came in to Sephora I
was really excited to see them coming
into safar because I'd actually been
eyeing the brand for a while I love
pasta lashes I love wearing false lashes
I love finding new lashes I think it's
awesome but I had never purchased it
from their website because their lashes
are like 25 I know they have $30 lashes
on there and that was just too expensive
for me so nice on coming to Sephora you
know now I can do eBay snow if I have
gift cards or you know if there's some
sort of special going on at Sephora I
won't feel so guilty about it so I
purchased the Coquette lashes and I
really really enjoyed them I thought
that they were really nice lashes so
I've been wanting to get another pair
but because they're $25 I was waiting
and so during the VIP sales when I
purchased another set so again these are
called the bomb best clashes there what
are on my lashes today and again really
liking these lashes I don't they have
four styles in total at Sephora not
everything from their website is on
Sephora I've been really eyeing the
Samantha lashes I mean do you think it's
a coincidence that so many brands have a
Samantha lash out there
or they F me I'm just kidding of course
but the Samantha lashes I have been
dying for a while those are the $30.00
lashes though and they're not Sephora
yet once I go to Sephora I will probably
be purchasing them but these are really
nice lashes I did mention them and they
make up I won't pay full price for
though because 25 dollars even though
I'm someone who uses lashes a ton I wear
lashes almost every single day of
whether I'm filming a video or not I
just I love them I think they complete
the look and I have teeny tiny little
lashes but even though I really love
them I still want to pay full price for
the next time I'm in the mood to buy
some lashes and I see a sale at Sephora
I would pick up the blinking beauty so
if you need a good lash recommendation
you could try out this brand there is a
sale I did pick up the Tarte tartlet
toasted eyeshadow palette I know a lot
of people have been very curious about
this one and my thoughts on this one so
this is the new eyeshadow palette from
Tarte it is $46 inside you do have the
mirror it's you know the pretty standard
Tarte lip palette and then you have your
shades this is a pretty monochromatic
warm toned eyeshadow palette and my
thoughts on it I do have it on my eyes
today I did this I did film this
tutorial for Instagram I have a latte in
the crease and then I have crackle all
over the lid and then I blended
everything in together with cashmere and
then I have cozy and warmth on my lower
lash line and then sunrise in my inner
corner and my grandpa does it though I
have been using this I think now I have
used every single shade in some way
shape or form on my eyes and I think the
palette is okay I think it's fine I
think it's nice I'm not overly blown
away by anything I'm not overly hyped
and I think what happened is kind of
like the same thing of what happened
with the naked heat palette is it's
almost like I feel like I'm limited and
in the looks that I can create I feel
like there's only a few different looks
that I'm gonna come up with and I try to
do something different today or like a
really dark smoky eye and I was really
attracted to this crackle shade up here
because it looks like like it's very
Brown and it looks like it's packed with
gold shimmer can you guys see any gold
shimmer on my lids because I can't when
I put it on the gold shimmer was there
so beautiful and then I blinked twice
and it all went over my face on my
cheeks everywhere on my nose I was like
oh okay and by the time I got done I
mean I have a completely matte eye look
right now and it looks like that shade
is just packed with gold shimmer so that
was super disappointing to me I was like
man I just wanted something like
different and fun and the that's not
really the case with this one I kind of
went back and forth on should I return
it should I keep it or not it was $46
and then with the 20% I mean that's
definitely better than the $54 with the
naked heat the reason I decided to keep
this one is because I like this eye
shadow formula and I like it more than I
like the naked heat the naked formula
I've talked about in past videos as well
it's just not my favorite I don't think
it's like fantastic the Tarte eyeshadow
formula I like much better
I liked the shimmers in here flame was
really beautiful all over the lid same
as simmer and the mats are really really
nice
they are the eyeshadow formula is what
is making me keep this eyeshadow palette
I just don't feel like I can get a ton
of looks out of it if you have the Naked
heat I don't think you need this one if
you have a lot of warm toned palettes I
don't think that you need this one
because there's not really anything in
here that to me makes this palette super
unique I really thought it was going to
be crackle I really thought it was going
to and it really it's not which bummed
me out so much I'm gonna keep it because
like I said I like the tartlet eyeshadow
palettes I like having it on hand for
like reviews and comparisons and things
like that and like I said I don't think
the formulas bad I just wish that maybe
there was like one other color in here
that maybe was a little bit more of a
pop and shade like I like these three
mats right here cashmere warmth and
latte but maybe swapping one of them out
for just something a little bit
different and then like simmer and
sunset these two shimmers right here
they're very very like similar to one
another maybe if we could have gotten
one other just more unique shade to the
palette I would have been a lot more
hyped over it so I mean it's still nice
if you don't have a lot of things like
this in your collection I would wreck
on the tart formula I think it's nice I
like the mirror I like packaging I like
the formula they're easy to blend and
all of that the shimmers are really
beautiful and you don't have to work
really hard for them but I just wish it
was a little bit more unique still a
really nice palette though just ended up
not being my absolute favorite which I'm
pretty bummed about but still nice and I
will still reach for it and last up I
did want to also review the target of
Park Ave apprentice a chisel palette I
did purchase this from Ulta versus a
Sephora because it wasn't in Sephora
stores yet but I did include it in the
hall and I thought I would include it in
here as well because I have been testing
it out to review and it is also now
available at Sephora so if you were
waiting for it to come in Sephora for
whatever reason you might have it is not
over there so I will have some links
down below so this is the chisel palette
you have a nice big mirror here and then
you have six different of face shades so
these two I have been using as as powder
underneath my eyes when I use a
concealer that doesn't crease a lot like
one concealer that I've been using this
palette with a lot for is the Urban
Decay all nighter concealer it's a newer
concealer and to me I barely have any
creasing with that one but that's
definitely concealer that I feel like I
don't need to like bake I don't need to
use like a heavy duty setting powder and
I just kind of use either of these two
shades I like them both one is more
pinky tone halos more pinky toned and
enhances more of a yellow base I just
kind of go back and forth depending on
the day I think that I can get away with
either halo is a little bit more
brightening I would say but I use them
under the eyes to brighten up the under
eyes or I will use it to clean up
contour on kind of like my jaw line if I
take a contour or bronzer too far down
I'll come in from those powders and just
kind of clean it up I really like both
of those I think they're very nice
carrot is what I use as a contour I do
have let's see I believe I have enhanced
on my under eyes today I have carrot on
as my contour and angle as the bronzer
that I have on today carrot as my
contour love it it's like my perfect
contour shade I think it's fantastic
right now I'm using angle as of my
bronzer which is the second to last one
here when I am not self tanned and I'm
like full-on winter pale I think a
princess cut will be a better bronzer
for me and then the only one that I
don't use for my face is crown I have
used this one
as a it's too dark to be like a
transition color on me but I've used it
on the outer part of my eye and it works
really well as an eye color it blended
out very easily and all of that so I
like this palette but I kind of had that
moment of do I need to keep this one as
well because this one is also $46 and it
is extremely similar has extremely
similar shades to it as the Tarte clay
play palette I know a lot of people are
wondering if I have the clay play do I
need the park a princess I don't think
you do I think the shades are gonna be a
little bit too similar I'll go ahead and
swatch some of these to the clay place
so you can see they're not exact dupes
in there they're not extremely similar
but I will say also that I actually like
the formula in the clay play for the
contour and bronzer shades I actually
like a butter in the clay play palette
than I do with this palette which was
interesting to me I didn't think that
was gonna happen so here are some
swatches the first one is from the clay
play app la this one is in desert next
this one is from Park Ave and this one
is in karat and then next we have
terracotta from the clay play and then
these last two are from a park AB and we
have angle and then princess cut and
then these two are the deeper tones from
the two and first one is from the clay
play palette and then the other one here
is from the park app which is in crown
so those who aren't very similar but I
mean you can see they're different
they're different tones like they
definitely have differences I do think
these two are pretty similar which is
terracotta from a clay play and then
angle from Park AB and those are what I
use as bronzers so I think that those
are pretty similar but I don't know if
you can even tell by the swatches like
the ones in the clay play are creamier I
feel like they're just easily like more
blendable and it just kind of surprised
me because I was like what I just I
would have thought it would be the same
formula in this but this one is doubly
lacking I mean you get different items
in each in the clay play you are getting
different eyeshadows and then in here
you have you know the different setting
powders and things like that but I
actually think I'm going to return park
of princess I just I don't feel like I
need to keep it it's really nice the
packaging
is really beautiful I like the mirror I
love face palettes so much but
especially when I compared it to the
clay play and I realize how much better
it seemed like the formula was in the
clay play palette I can't really justify
it to myself to keep this for the forty
six dollars and really between that and
like not overly loving the toasted
palette I was like you can't keep both
at $46 you have to pick one to return
because it just doesn't make sense and I
decided that I liked the toast of
palette more than keeping around the
park app princess and I feel like I
would get more uses out of the toasted
palette than I would the park app
princess
so it's still nice if you don't have a
lot of face palettes if the clay plate
didn't interest you like the eye shadow
part in there didn't interest you but
you still want some new face powders and
these would work for your skin tone so
unfortunately to me it's not bad but
it's just it's not worth it to keep
around at the $46 so I am actually gonna
go ahead and return this next time I go
to my Ulta I will be sending this back
so that kind of bummed me out but I'd
love to know if you guys tried this one
as well did you think the same thoughts
that I did if you have the clay play do
you think it's worth to keep both in my
personal opinion in my personal
recommendations I would say no if you
love your clay play or you picked it up
I don't think that you have to pick up
this one too so it was nice but not nice
enough chic hang on so I'm so sorry
I guess so after those that comparison
that is going to do it for my Sephora
