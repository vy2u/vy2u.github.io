today's video is going to be my Sephora
VAV self haul follow-up video so I am
back to share my reviews on the products
that I picked up during the vib sale so
if you're ready to give my feedback on
these products but I'm gonna go ahead
and get started
so if you have not yet seen my Sephora
vib sale hull of course we'll have that
video listed down below as always with
my house I like to come back in about
two weeks and just give reviews on all
of the products I will say one item that
I haven't tried yet because I kind of I
don't know if I would say I forgot that
I got this but I put it underneath my
like a bathroom sink and forgot that I
actually haven't tried this guy out and
I should have been trying him these are
the stuff that I bought from Lancome the
bi-facil for face and eye I have the eye
makeup remover and I love it so I was
getting this as like a backup but then I
thought that I could try out the face
remover as well because I love that eye
makeup remover so much but it was like
I'm not completely out of my iMac
remover so I was like I'll just put that
under my sink for when it's time I'm
like Hello it's there's two things you
could have opened this up and been using
the face one so I don't have a review on
that yet because I'm kind of an idiot so
there's that but I'm sure I'll break
through that in an upcoming video here
soon but I was like Hello
just together Samantha but I make
remover is fantastic
another item I've only been able to try
this one out once it's the haircare item
that I got this is from living proof
it's the curl enhancing styling mousse
so I actually have it in my hair now
I've only used it once because I don't I
don't do this a lot with my hair it's
not something I do in a fairly regular
basis by any means so if I kept waiting
for like the 3 to 5 times I was gonna
try this this video would be like 3
months in the future but what I do when
I use most is like if I'm being a rush I
don't have a lot of time to shower or
I'm showering before bed and I don't
want to go to bed with my hair really
what I will actually shampoo my hair at
skip conditioner and put mousse in it
and it just kind of helps dry my hair
faster than it would just leaving out
straight and I don't blow dry my hair
but it also just gives me like a little
bit of it always seems to be different
when I do this with my hair sometimes
it's like really wavy sometimes the
Bordeaux ends on curly but it typically
always gives me a little bit of like
just like a volume and
giorgia to my hair but again I just I
don't do it on a very like frequent
basis but when I want to do it when I'm
rush I want a skip conditioner I need to
have a mousse in my collection otherwise
my hair is just a hot mess so like I
said I've only tried this one out the
one time but it'll probably be a while
before I'd have a full review on it
but so far it seems pretty good I like
the way that it smelled it is very like
foamy moosie I noticed when I sprayed it
into my hand it really like Georgia up
right away or it seems to be performing
pretty well but again I'll have to give
this a try
down the road you know maybe you'll see
a review in like two months or so but
one product that was not featured in
that haul video but I thought that I
would put it in this review video is
from Marc Jacobs got it this is the
tantastic omega bronzer and I'm so
excited that I got this so this wasn't
available yet when I did my original
purchases it actually came available
after I think it was even after it
already filmed my haul video it came
available early for VIP Rouge members so
I went ahead and snagged it on that day
I think it is sold out right now like
then it came available for everybody but
I think it actually sold out I thought
it was supposed to be coming back as a
permanent item I think so it should be
coming back but I'm really excited to
get it once I got it on the vib rouge
day I actually was still able to use my
15% off it was still during the sale
time which I thought was pretty sweet so
I thought I would include it in here it
has a big old mirror on it it's a super
nice bronzer it's expensive so I was
glad that I got the 15% off because it
is a pricy bronzer I think it's like $49
but I have talked about this bronzer
before I'm sure I put it in makeup I
regret not buying video because I was
gonna purchase this and then I thought
it was too expensive and then all of a
sudden everybody everybody was like this
is the best bronzer ever this is the
best this is my holy grail I can't live
without this bronzer and it was gone it
was limited edition so it was gone
forever and Marc Jacobs finally brought
it back and I'm really happy about that
this is a balm bronzer it's the bomb I
don't know what else I have to say I am
so so happy with my purchase of this
browser without big she is I does a lot
it ya know I'm so happy with the
persistence bronzer I know it's more
pricy I'm glad that I got the discount
but still even if I paid full price for
it I think I would still be happy it's
beautiful it's really natural-looking on
the skin but gives you that nice bronze
it's one of those bronzers that like you
can just like keep piling it on and you
still don't look unnatural you don't
look crazy
it's so fantastic I'm so happy with it I
love the way it smells I would highly
recommend it like I said I'm pretty sure
it's supposed to be coming back as a
permanent item so when it does I would
highly recommend this I'm so glad I'm so
glad I got it already let's move on to
some makeup products so this first one
here is from Sunday of Riley and it is
the influencer foundation okay so I also
did not only did I do my fall video but
then I did like a try on haul style
video um after that where I was
basically trying the majority of these
products in this haul on my face in that
video most of them were first
impressions this Sunday Riley Foundation
included and I think that you can kind
of see from that video that I was like
I'm really sure what's going on here
it was kind of accentuating my dry
patches like at the end I still was like
I'm not sure if I don't really know
about the foundation I have been wearing
the crap out of it because it has been
really hard to get my full thoughts on
this so I keep wearing it and keep
wearing because I'm like I'm trying to
understand this foundation I do have it
on today I picked mine up in the shade
at 1:40 which is supposed to be a light
with neutral undertones I think it
definitely does have the neutral
undertones good it is light it's pretty
light on my skin once I like contour and
bronze and all of that I think that it
looks good but especially like entering
into summer or when I self tan a lot I
don't think the shade match would be
spot-on for me but it's still pretty
good for me okay so it says that it's
supposed to be natural-looking and I
would really agree with that I think out
of all of these claims I think the
natural looking is like the one that
they definitely nailed that is exactly
how I would describe my skin when I wear
this foundation I'm not mad I'm not dewy
I'm not anything I'm just it looks like
my natural skin just like ish better
like it like ish and I I do like some
natural finish
patience the covergirl one the healthy
vital is elixir I feel like that gives a
pretty natural finish as well but it
also makes my skin look better Sunday
Riley wouldn't like it struggles to make
my skin look better um it does say that
it's long wear and I don't agree with
that I feel like those transfers onto
basically everything I feel like by the
end of the day I look worse for wear
when I have this foundation on so I
don't agree with the long wear claim of
it it sounds a lightweight feel that
one's hard when you pump it out it
definitely is a very like liquidy almost
kind of like a watery type of foundation
when you're applying it yeah it feels
lightweight on the skin but also it says
that it's medium to full coverage and
it's like light to medium coverage on me
and I feel like it's not very buildable
as well because I realized like I kept
adding more foundation to my face and
more foundation to my face because I was
trying to get more coverage and I just
feel like it doesn't really cover a lot
for me like I have some redness around
my mouth it's not really covering any of
that sometimes I have like I have a red
mark under my eyes somedays that's more
prominent than others I feel like it
doesn't cover that so I don't know
medium is really pushing it for me I've
never been able to get full coverage out
of this foundation which i think is
strange satin to matte finish I would
agree with that because I feel like it
is fairly natural looking and I don't
feel like I really look super matte when
I wear this but this foundation is it's
just been so hard to get the hang of and
to get my thoughts on it because it's
like I wear it one day and I'm like oh
it's okay I wear the next day I was like
I hate it I'm definitely returning it I
tried it again I was like no maybe it's
alright I tried it again I was like ooh
no I don't think it works for me I think
I am going to return it but I've noticed
that with every single time I've worn it
and I've probably worn it maybe seven
times now I either think it's okay or I
don't like it at all
I there's never been a day where I'm
like I think that I like how this
foundation looks on me I have dry skin
right now and I feel like it's
definitely showing off my dry patches
and I noticed that right when I first
was trying it out says some dry patches
on my forehead and I felt like it was
like BAM I got a dry patch on my
forehead Here I am and I was like oh no
and it also was doing weird things
around my nose I mean after I wear this
for like five or six hours
completely broken up around my nose it's
completely broken up around my mouth I
don't really have very prominent Smile
Alliance like they're there but they're
not like they're not like there yet and
I've never really noticed or had an
issue with a lot of foundations settling
into those lines and this one does after
a couple of hours it's broken up it's in
any single line that I have the lines on
my forehead
after I wear those for a couple hours I
feel like I look older than I am and
your girl's 71 we don't need that
happening we're trying to reverse the
aging process here I'm not trying to
look older so that's been kind of rough
for me I like the pump applicator I
think that that's good I like the
packaging I would suggest applying it
with a brush I continually was applying
it with a Beauty Blender because that's
kind of I go on like phases between dáil
of Beauty blenders are brushes to apply
foundations right now I'm firmly on the
Beauty Blender train but once I started
applying this with a brush I felt like I
was finally like somewhat able to get
almost medium coverage in there so I
like applying it with a brush more but I
just don't think it's very long wearing
and I think that it just after a couple
of hours I don't feel like it looks very
nice on the skin for the first like
three to four hours I do genuinely think
that it looks pretty good - my dry
patches but after that it goes downhill
so that's pretty rough and what's
strange to me as I've been watching some
reviews for it and a lot of people who
have oily skin are saying that they do
not recommend it either and they feel
like it's sliding off their face by the
end of the day and I just haven't powder
so much you know to try to get it to
stay on and I have dry skin and I'm like
it's showing off my dry patches so I
don't know maybe if you have normal skin
you would like this but honestly it's
really hard to recommend this foundation
I feel like I don't know I feel like
I've tried it so many different ways
I've tried it with probably five
different primers trying to find like
that one primer that's going to make it
look good or make it stay I definitely
when I wear this I like to put powder
over it as well I've been really been
loving the covergirl healthy elixir
powder I like it better I wanted to put
it on today but I was like don't do it
because you know the point is that
you're wearing this on camera so don't
put powder over it that makes it a
little bit better and makes
last a little bit longer but I'm pretty
bummed about this so I'm actually I am
probably gonna take this back to Sephora
and maybe try to get a different
foundation instead so that really bummed
me out because I was really excited
about that foundation but next up though
I have the laura mercier this is the new
flawless of fusion ultra longwear
concealer I did mention in my trying
video that I had already tried it on I
think it was like two or three times and
that I was really impressed with it and
I continued to be really impressed with
it I will say that I another thing with
the Sunday Riley foundation is I don't
feel like concealers worked well with
that foundation which is weird
not only the Laura Mercier but at first
I was like is it just the Laura Mercier
because I've been wearing this one so
much to test to be able to review it but
I used my NYX and also my holy grail
over in decay and make it skin and it's
like something with that foundation just
does not mix well with a concealer like
powders and highlights and things like
that I think is fine but for whatever
reason when I put a concealer on with
that foundation it's odd it's just odd
so if my front it's if my concealer
looks crazy today it is this but I swear
to you it's the foundation because I've
worn this with other foundations as well
and I'm really really liking it and then
it's nice and full coverage
I like the wand on it it's kind of like
a like the Wan kind of like bends a
little bit which i think is nice when
you're applying it it's kind of like
bendy which is like a really random
thing but I like the applicator
I like the coverage that it gives it
makes it under eyes really smooth
looking I feel like it lasts really well
throughout the day as well I don't get a
lot of creasing with it I just I'm
really impressed with this one honestly
I've been reaching for it a lot not only
to review but once I was like okay I
have like what I want to say in my
review and like I would recommend it I
still keep reaching for it my Urban
Decay Naked skin is like I'm hey girl
you remember me and I'm like hold on
just wait one second I just want to try
Laura out just a little bit more okay
yeah I would definitely recommend this
one so next time let's talk about
another product that I don't really love
unfortunately this is from Anasazi
Beverly Hills and it's the bronzer in
Thani so I really like the packaging on
this bronzer I thought it was quite nice
I like that you get a mirror in here
when I did first open up this bronzer I
was like oh shoot I think this might be
too dark for me especially
right now so I was like oh I'm not sure
and I tried it before I tried it in my
Hall Tryon video
goodness gracious how many times since
they tried and I was like you know what
I think it pulls a little bit orange on
me I will say on camera I don't think
that it looked as bad but sometimes
especially when I have lights on and I
have two lights shining at me today I
feel like sometimes makeup isn't it
doesn't look the same in person as it
does on camera and I feel like this
definitely looked better on camera and
especially once I have the rest of my
face done again it's kinda like the same
thing with the foundation like once I
get it all done and put together I'm
like okay doesn't look as bad but I
still just don't really love the way
that this looks on me a lot of people
are saying that anastacio bronzers are
supposed to be more red toned which is
supposed to give you a more natural like
flushed look from the Sun which I can
totally understand that but to me it
still looks Orange especially just when
I'm first applying it and I'm kind of
like panicking like Oh No Oh No what's
going on um other than that I think it's
a nice bronzer I think it's pretty
smooth I think it's pretty easy to build
lend out but honestly what's so funny is
to compare this to the Marc Jacobs and
there's like zero comparisons like the
Marc Jacobs goes on so incredibly
smoothly it looks so natural like I said
I feel like it's one of those bronzers
that even if you go heavy hand it you're
not gonna look crazy if I go have a hand
it with this I'm going to look crazy so
unfortunately I feel like I'm going to
return it because I don't feel confident
when I wear it and I have not been
reaching for this lately and today I
even grabbed out the Marc Jacobs bronzer
to put on if you I list all my makeup in
my description box always you've been
seeing the market goes bronzer and
they're quite a bit because I've been
loving it and I was like you know what
you have to wear that Anasazi one again
today I was like you need to try it out
again before you make a final decision
if you're going to return it I was like
but I don't want to wear it and I mean
if I don't want to wear the makeup that
I bought that's pretty silly so I think
I'm gonna end up returning this one and
you know especially I have the Too Faced
palette I'll talk about next that has a
bronzer in it the Marc Jacobs bronzer
was a pricy bronzer and I mean this one
was - this is $28 for one bronzer that's
still fairly pricey and it
I don't feel like it looks the best on
me so unfortunately this one didn't
really work out for me and I know a lot
of people are also saying that they feel
like the Anasazi bronzers are pulling
orange on them and it just is one of
those things where if you don't feel
confident like why why would I continue
to to keep that around so it's good news
good news the Too Faced natural face
palette hello I've really been liking
this guy I have really been liking this
palette so it's a really nice face
palette you got a big ol mirror in here
it's very like shiny so it's hard to do
on camera but gigantic mirror though
it's really beautiful and then you have
these six different shades in here I've
been really impressed with this palette
the sunny honey is the bronzer that I've
been using mostly and I really enjoy
that the Tropic like it's hot it's kind
of a funny name and it has a bit of like
a sheen to it and it's also just a
smidge darker so I haven't really been
gravitating towards that one maybe as
the seasons change I might get into that
one a little bit more pinks and is a
beautiful blush I have it on my cheeks
today and I think it's a stunning blush
I was really excited when I open the
palette my eyes instantly went towards
that when it's a really nice kind of
like deeper neutral blush and I think
it's beautiful pink wink at the other
blush in here I haven't used that one
yet it's a little bit too pink and like
too bright for me right now but again a
seasons change I might get into it the
two highlights in here are actually kind
of interesting because I don't love
either one on their own but combined
together I really like them and that's
what I have on my cheeks today I think
it's a beautiful highlight I feel like
it's a very beaming but Starlight is a
little bit too pink for me like it's a
straight pink highlight when I put it on
and satin sheets is kind of like gold
and peachy at the same time but it's
almost like a little bit too gold for me
so I I just prefer to mix the two and
that's how I've been wearing them and I
think once I do that I love the
combination of the pink and the gold and
the peach and I love just how popping it
is um yeah I'm really happy with it
again there's just those two shades in
there that I I'm not using right now but
I think I will use in the next coming
months here or so but the other four
that I've been using I really enjoy
I'm really happy I actually got this at
20% off because I did pick it up from
Ulta when they released their 20% coupon
the day before the sale started at
Sephora and I'm really happy with this
purchase which is super exciting because
I haven't bought from Too Faced in a
very long time but this guy I think is
really good
all righty the eyeshadow palette that I
picked up it was it from Hooda Beauty
this is the mob obsessions palette I
talked about the obsessions palettes a
lot I mentioned her new ones in my most
recent bullabbai video and I said I was
probably gonna pick up the coral one I
really like these palettes you get a
mirror you get 9 different shades in
here I have three now warm Browns smoky
and then the moths one and I do want to
pick up the coral one as well I really
like the eye shadow palettes I feel like
these are really good quality I really
like the color scheme on this one
because I've been so into pinks lately
I've been wearing pink so much my vibes
right now so especially like I mean this
palette is just speaking to me I do have
it on my eyes today I've been wearing it
a lot lately I'm just really gravitating
towards this but I highly recommend the
hooda Beauty palette I think they're
fantastic and at $27 I honestly don't
think that they're a bad price either so
really happy with this one I did pick up
two lip products from the sale I tried
on the lawless Beauty lipstick and
Cameron in my Tryon video so what's
interesting to me is that this one when
i swatched it it definitely looked more
just like pink but on the lips it's
actually pretty light and again I do
have two lights going because
unfortunately we're having storms here
today poor Aires has her thunder shirt
on do have it on my lips today and I
actually ended up putting a gloss over
it I have on backtalk from urban decay
because it is very very light on the
lips which I wasn't expecting I thought
it would be more of like a light pink
which it's definitely a light pink but
it's just super super light so I think
when I wear this I'll either put a lip
liner underneath it to kind of give it
more of an oomph or top it with a lip
gloss or another way I wore it this way
the other night I put George on from
lawless which is more of like a true
nude I would say and then I kind of
doubted this one in the center of it to
kind of give it that kind of effect and
I really liked it that way but I love
the law of speedy lipsticks this is now
my fourth one they're really pricey at
$25 so I really only want to buy
during a sale because that's really
expensive for a liquid lipstick I think
the only ones that are more expensive
than that in my collection that I've
purchased myself are from Marc Jacobs
beauty and I really like those little
products too but I really like these I
think they're very long-lasting I think
that you need a very little product it's
gonna go a long way they're very opaque
I think they smell really good and they
last I was wearing George the other day
and I ate a huge burritos I lipstick
still looked phenomenal I posted a
picture on Instagram of it and bloodless
beauty actually reposted me with still
have the caption in there like just ate
a burrito lawless beauty is legit
because my lipstick all looked perfect
so I think that these are really legit
lipsticks I would recommend them I'm a
little thrown by the color but not
enough that I would even go in and
exchange it for another color cuz I
still do like it and I don't say I'm
probably just gonna buy the whole
collection one day like I'm gonna get
there I'm gonna keep buying all the
lipsticks slowly and surely one at a
time but I highly do recommend those
next up I purchased this one from a Kat
Von D this is one of the studded kiss
lipsticks right because I know I kept
saying it wrong
this is this has studded kiss creme
lipstick this is in bow and arrow it's
just a nice regular lipstick I was
wearing it in one of my previous videos
I'm still pre filming for when I'm gonna
be gone so I'm just confused as to what
video is what these days and when
they're going up because I'm just trying
to get everything so I don't miss a
video while I'm gone I was actually
wearing this in my first impression
follow-up video and I was going to a
concert
right after I was talking filming that
so I grabbed this and then I also
grabbed my Kat Von D liquid lipsticks in
both bow and arrow and Ludwick and I was
trying to decide which one I wanted to
put over it I went with bow and arrow
kiss you're wondering just like it made
more sense of course but I really like
these lipsticks I would highly recommend
them if you like regular old lipsticks
and bow-and-arrow is a beautiful shade I
know of the regular and the liquid
lipstick I love that shade last time I
just have to skincare items that these
are both from Lula Hendrickson one of my
favorite skincare brands I kind of
splurged a little bit on these I kind of
went back and forth on if I should do
order if I should not do it but I tried
a lot of la Hendrickson's products I
loved a lot of them and so I thought I
was going to go ahead and do it so I
picked up the new a/c rush brightening
gel creme
so this is what I've been using as
morning moisturizer it says it has three
sources of vitamin C and also Rose of
winter extract so this is what it looks
like I feel like a little bit definitely
goes a very long way like I said this
has been my morning moisturizer since
pretty much since I got it which it has
been two weeks now but a little bit goes
a very long way it smells so delightful
and it just feels incredibly
moisturizing on the skin and once you
put it on I feel like it really is one
of those that you can notice your skin
is looking brighter and so I really
enjoy that I will have an Instagram
video going up like I said I'm pre
filming so I got that filmed already
I'll have it going up on my Instagram if
it's up by the time this video goes up
I'll have it linked down below but I
will have a video showing these two and
also a few other products from Lula
Hendrickson so you can kind of see how
it makes my skin look right as I'm
applying them but this is also one of
those products where my skin just looks
so good after I use it when I actually
filmed yesterday filmed yesterday at the
skincare video and I had to take a
shower a couple hours after that and I
knew I had to but I kept looking at my
skin I was like I want to go shower it
goes like my skin looks really good and
I would like it to continue looking like
this it just looks like a little bit
like plumper and just more moisturize
and just it looks really nice when I use
this so I've really been loving this guy
and then I also picked up the banana
bright eye creme and this has vitamin C
and his collagen boost it so again I've
been using this in the mornings as well
I have a lot of my hendrickson products
in my morning skincare routine this is
another one where you can see a
difference and again it's why I wanted
to make that Instagram video so you can
see it thicker eye cream and it kind of
just like lifts the eyes a lot of times
in the morning I like to go with
something that has like a cooling or
like I do puffing effect but honestly
with this one even though it doesn't
have those properties it still is like
it's like it's like lifts your under
eyes and just makes you look a little
bit more awake and it brightens them and
I've been really impressed with this as
well I've been hearing really good
reviews on both of these products which
is why I decided to go ahead and do it
and especially with having the 15% off I
was like let's just do it and so far I'm
not mad in the slightest with these
products alright guys so that is gonna
do it for today's video and my follow-up
for my support vib sale haul
of course everything will be linked down
below including my haul video and my
Tryon video if you want to see those in
action I also will have an Instagram
video of a eye makeup look with the hood
of beauty products and also a bunch of
these products as well I wanted to also
have that on Instagram so if you don't
follow me over on Instagram I am having
a giveaway over there right now actually
shameless plug I am but I also like to
do a lot of mini tutorials over there
because I know I don't do a ton on
YouTube I definitely do more these days
but I try to do them pretty consistently
on my Instagram as well as you can see
how makeup is applying also but other
than that that's gonna do it for today's
video I hope that you found my reviews
helpful let me know what you thought in
the comments down below but otherwise if
you guys did enjoy this one I hope that
you'll give it a thumbs up I hope that
you'll also consider subscribing before
you go and I'll catch you guys in that
