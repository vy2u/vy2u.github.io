today's video I'm super excited for
because it is going to be my Sephora vib
sale haul follow-up video so if you did
not see my Sephora vib sale hull I will
leave that linked down below but it's
been a couple of weeks now I've been
testing everything out I have some
reviews and feedback for you guys let
you know what I thought about the
products that I decided to pick up
during the haul thank you guys for
letting me know that you really do want
to see abuse a follow up haul video I
did one for my last haul my birthday
haul I did a follow up video from that
and asked if you guys wanted to see
these types of videos and it was an
overwhelming yes I totally get it some
of my favorite videos to watch as well
so each time I do a haul I will a couple
weeks later do a follow-up video from
that and let you develop my reviews and
thoughts but if you want to see what I
thought about everything that I picked
up during the support VAV sale keep on
watching so first I want to talk about a
couple of items that I picked up
actually at Ulta when they had the 20%
off coupon I mentioned in my haul video
that rates for the vib sale where you
only got 15% off also released a 20%
coupon and it could be used on prestige
brands so I did use that first I picked
up just a few items from Ulta so one was
this TARDIS lash applicator I believe
this was $14 and it's just a tool to
help apply your lashes and yeah it's
fantastic I have not started using I
have not applied my lashes one time
since getting this without the /
applicator I always used to apply my
lashes either with my fingers or I would
use my tweezers which my tweezers are
like very sharp and I'd always get like
a little nervous about it fantastic it
is super super easy to align the lashes
up in this section right here and then
just place them on the lash line I have
been finding this super super simple if
you are a lover of lashes or even if
you're like a beginner of lashes I think
this tool can really help you out
because I've been loving it I did pick
up a couple brow products from at
benefit so this one is the Bravo
conditioning primer I said that I wasn't
sure i saw was kind of like mixed
feedback about it in my comment section
I did a Sephora vib recommendations in
wish list video also have that link down
below in case you're curious of what I
wanted to pick up
a lot of people were just mixed in my
comment section so I didn't know what to
do and really the only reason I decided
to go for it was because there was a
free gift with purchase as a really cute
pink benefit bag which I really love so
instead of just getting the precise in
my brow I added onto Bravo conditioning
primer so if you get the free bags
because loves like the world I live in
and that's what I do to myself so this
is very interesting to me this is what
the applicator looks like it is supposed
to help condition your browse and
supposed to help grow your brows and I
just wasn't really sure so on the back
it says nutrient-rich primer for fuller
looking brows so my thing is is that I
kind of already have pretty structured
brows as maybe what I would say this
brow is definitely a lot weaker it has a
lot of bear spots in it should i snow
because it's all made for a while I'm
not a big brow person I never really
understood the brow trend and I received
so much hate for it and it was still
freaking annoying I'm always open to
experimenting and trying new things and
whatnot and so I thought maybe I could
get the conditioning primer to like so
in the little spots that I don't have in
my brows and then it would be easier to
take some sort of brow pencil and just
like filled them in because I don't need
to draw on my full brows they're there
like I have bro so that is kind of what
I wanted to buy this guy for and also a
lot of people are saying like I don't
have enough hair light in between my
eyebrows because apparently people want
me to have unibrow I have no ideas
people are just crazy when it comes to
eyebrows I yes so I thought maybe I
could use this as well from the front of
my brow holy crap I think it works I
have to say I think it worked
I showed like a close-up of my eyebrows
on my snapchat the other day and there
is like hair everywhere I literally
stopped using this because I feel like
it is like making my eyebrows so
overgrown that I want to go to the
benefit brow bar and get a damn brow wax
because the most holy bucket if you do
not have a lot of eyebrows and you
really want fuller looking eyebrows I
seriously honestly I'm telling you that
I think that this worked
I like 'whoa product it was definitely
very very interesting to me I was a
little bit skeptical if it works but for
me seriously it did I was very surprised
like I said I've actually kind of
stopped using it because
is I feel like I'm kind of having like
the overgrown eyebrows and I need to go
get him like groomed a little bit but
yeah if you want more brows check out
the Bravo conditioning primer because I
do think it worked in addition to that
product I also bought the precisely my
brow pencil from Benefit Cosmetics I
wanted to see the difference between
this and the goof proof because I have
the abuse proof pencil and I really do
like it but the precisely my brow is
just a very precise brow pencil this is
what the tip looks like so you can see
just a very tiny little pencil there
what I've been using this for is to
create the hair like strokes at the
front of my brows that's kind of why
another reason I brought the precisely
my brow but it's definitely super super
different from the goof proof what I've
been doing a lot lately is like just
using this for the beginning of my brows
and then filling in the rest of them
what the goof proof just to make them a
little bit darker and to fill in any
bare spots so that's what I've been
using the precisely my brow for and I
actually really do like it there what I
picked up from Alton kind of my feedback
on them for the brow pencils for the
precisely my brown the disprove ominous
shade - I have no idea if that's my
correct shade but I think it looks good
enough and I roll with it so that's when
I picked up from Ulta for my Sephora vib
sale but now let's jump into the rest of
the items that I actually purchased from
Sephora and got my 15% off one that I
just want to touch on because I believe
this was just mentioned in my favorites
video or was in my favorites video I
don't remember but I know that I was
just talking about these might have been
in my follow birthday haul envelope but
I bought another one of the Marc Jacobs
highliners I bought this one in green
shade it's like a shimmer green and it's
called overt and it is beautiful my
friend Lisa sent me a couple of these
and which I featured in my birthday haul
and I love them so much I ended up
purchasing another one these are I
believe $25 which is super expensive for
an eyeliner but if it is an amazing
eyeliner then I'm just going to go ahead
and do it and this really was I was
super happy to get the 15% off of course
because I like 100 makeovers just a
little bit cheaper that's lovely but
seriously I want so many more these Babs
Beauty have been raving about the really
like light pink one so now I need that
one I'm kind of upset
myself that I didn't purchase it during
the hall as well but this green one is
really beautiful really the best part of
these are how long they last in the
water line it is in complete insanity so
yeah I definitely love these want to get
more super super impressed with them
pick up a couple more things from Marc
Jacobs Beauty one of being the dewdrops
coconut gel highlighter now this is
forty four dollars and I went back and
forth on this so much they said in a
while I buy a video that's going to skip
over it because I thought it was too
much funny
and I just didn't think I needed it I've
been on a highlighter know by for a
while but I broke my rule for this guy
so I was like you know what I'm going to
save some money
it's beautiful packaging I love
highlighting and Marc Jacobs has just
been really really impressing me lately
so I decided to just go for it and you
know know that no one will judge me
because we're all in a Josh my free zone
here that is what I like to think of as
my channel okay so this is what the
packaging looks like and it does have a
pump on it and oh my goodness
I just pumped out way too much on my
hand because that is going to be like
extreme you need like the tiniest
tiniest drop of this like this is way
too much this is like probably even too
much for both sides of my cheeks you
need the tiniest amount of product this
is not going to last me one lifetime
this is going to last me for lifetimes
like this could be some things that I
pass down to my children and they could
pass on to their children I mean you
know that's disgusting and you know it's
really not going to happen but if makeup
didn't expire and it didn't go bad like
that would be what I was passed down to
my children and they could pass down to
their children look at that highlight
look at that tiny drop and what it did
like it is absolutely insane it is
binding when I first put it on my cheeks
the first time I use it I was like oh my
gosh you know what sometimes your
highlight can look like when you're like
taking a photo or you're on snapchat and
then your face like hits the Sun the
right way and it is like that blinding
glow that is what this highlight looks
like all of the time that's what this
highlight is I'm not mad that I got this
I really am not mad I think it is
beautiful I haven't tried mixing it in
with my foundation yet I know a lot of
people like to mix
in what the foundation I haven't tried
that yet but I definitely well so far
I've just been wearing it as a highlight
and I absolutely love it I think it's
stunning yeah I am totally not
regretting this this was one where I
thought maybe I would and if I didn't
love it I was going to return it because
I get to this $44 so I was like if I
don't love it I'm taking it back but
nope nope I'm keeping it right here
I'm keeping it right here the item that
I got from Marc Jacobs is a lipstick now
this is the LaMarca liquid lip creme in
truther bear and I was very curious
about this I got the Marc Jacob Lamarck
regular lipstick in a give me some nude
lip from Sephora and I loved it like
sell them up with it so hard so when I
saw these I was like you know what I
want to try like the liquid lip version
of that as well and see how much I like
it and yeah yeah it's no joke I'll go
how to do is to watch such a me color it
is so stunning I have this color on in
my morphe collection video I'm pretty
sure so if you haven't seen that one
I'll leave it linked down below and I
was getting a lot of comments about my
lip color and that is this one and it is
beautiful I love the formula it goes on
so well I just makes your list look good
like it doesn't I have been having dry
lips really bad I've been trying to do
oils on them and like exfoliating
treatments and things like that I'm just
having really dry lips right now and I
have was a really gnarly bruise on my
lip I think I must like fit my lips when
I was sleeping I did just get a wisdom
tooth extracted so seriously like my
mouth my lips my gum my tongue
everything like it's just been in like a
state of disarray for the past like two
weeks or whatever so I don't know what
something happened and I was putting on
a lipstick the other day and it did not
hide the thrus I could see the bruising
through it I'll take on me and there's
other lipsticks that like cling to your
dry patches on your lips and emphasize
them or days like settle into your lines
around your lips and it's not good
looking this looks amazing
on the lips it looks amazing I love the
color I love the formula it's super
comfortable it's not like a traditional
liquid lipstick that dries down
completely matte like there is a little
bit of train tour with this but just a
little bit to me after you let it dry
down for a while just a little bit of
transfer but super comfortable but soup
long lasting like it has the longevity
of a regular liquid lipstick but it's so
much more comfortable it's like I really
enjoyed this formula if you're looking
for a liquid lipstick but in a much more
comfortable formula and one that still
looks really good on the lips and gives
you that long-lasting feeling this Marc
Jacobs one I thought was fantastic again
my shade was in truth art there is a $28
so they were crazy but I know I'm buying
more like I know I will buy more so
impressed - sick with lipsticks I also
picked up Ludovic from Kat Von D lewd
Zig I was saying Ludwig because that is
how it felt never let me know and is
losing I'm pretty sure Ludwig you can
let me go from Sarah but now I just
enjoy saying it that way so this is from
her everlasting liquid lipstick line I
have bow and arrow and I absolutely love
it I love the formula so much I decided
that I wanted to pick up another one so
I picked up blue big and I am entirely
obsessed I actually already mentioned
this one in my April makeup monthly and
I mentioned in the favorites section
because like I knew I knew I was going
to get along with this lipstick I put it
on right when I got the box because I'm
so excited for it it's like that your
lips the better a beautiful nude pink it
just mmm it's stunning I really like a
formula I think it sticks around for a
very long time it's not super drying on
me I know some people complain that the
Kat Von D lips are a little bit drying I
do not find them drying on me personally
but I just really love this formulas and
very impressed with it I really wanted
to get another one from the line and
Ludwig it's such a beautiful color this
from Tarte cosmetics it's their
rainforest of the state color splash
lipstick I got mine in the shade Colaba
first of all the packaging like it's
absolutely amazing I thought that was
balm and then this is what the lipstick
looks like so colada was described as a
peachy brown nude and producer which is
like basically me in a bottle so I
thought that was amazing
this one is colada right here a lot of
people have been raving about these
lipsticks so that's what I really want
to get them I want to be able to test
them out on my own and see if the hype
was real the hype is so real these are
so good I want more so bad I actually
watched Hart snapchat and one of the
gals did all of the lip swatches on her
like the other day and I sat there with
my pen and pencil and wrote down the
shades that I wanted I think I wrote
down four or five shades that I like
knew what absolutely had to get so yeah
these are super comfortable again very
long-lasting that like lipsticks are
really stepping up their game where
they're still a comfortable looks like
they still look good on the list but
they have a better longevity too then
they're not liquid lipstick you know
they're not that long-lasting but
definitely very long-lasting I thought
this one really held up very well I
loved the color on me I'm just super
pretty I'll definitely get more these
hang onto the last few items here so I
caved in had bought the afar Sallie rose
gold elixirs are 24 karat gold infused
Beauty oil and I said that I bought it
basically just to be a part of the
beauty community you know like people
tell me I can't be a beauty blogger
because like I don't do eyebrows I
definitely also felt but I wasn't
welcome in the community because I was
on Instagram dropping this all over my
face I now and I'm checking it all over
my face and apparently Pharsalia thought
I looked a good job on my face because
they actually Reshard one of my makeup
tutorials it was like super exciting day
so that was very cool thank you so much
for Sally so yeah this little guy is $54
you get one fluid ounce of 24 karat gold
infused Beauty oil so this is what it
looks like in there so a lot of people
have been curious in my feedback for
this first off it smells really good I
love the way it smells it smells very
like refreshing hydrating like it just
feels really nice on the skin and we're
not even dropping it all over my face
and I have to say it feels really nice
it's an interesting oil to me because
when I start to rub it in it's almost
like it's a little bit thicker like it
hasn't moved to it like it has 24 karat
gold flakes inside of it or something
crazy like that you know but it just
feels a kind of feel nicer than other
oils that I've tried in the past okay
I'm saying it I use it before my makeup
I use almost kind of like a moisturizer
I don't use it as a primer I think that
other one can be used as a primer
but what I do is I put this on first I
put out my lips and put all over my face
I really like it I let it sit for a
while dry hey now I think about how
amazing I am cuz I just like 24 karat
gold likes on my face and then I put my
primer and I do my makeup and I think it
looks really nice I do like how it helps
look at lipsticks I think it helps with
the longevity of look it looks like
something it makes them a lot more
comfortable when I'm going to put on one
of my lip lips that I don't find to be a
super comfortable formula I will try to
put this on first also what I like using
this on is full coverage foundation like
one that I'm going to mention here
shortly from hourglass sometimes when I
use that one without the oil it just
looks like a little bit too much on my
face and not that it's like really hard
to blend out but I just feel like the
foundations blend out easier when I have
the oil line and again for me I'm not a
huge full-coverage girl because
sometimes I think you can look too cakey
on my skin and just feel heavy and when
I use the oil in combination with my
full coverage foundations I like it way
more on the skin so I am actually glad
that I pop this it was $54 like I was
not sure but I watched that girl Shea I
washed her Sephora vib sale haul and she
said the same thing about this she
bought this and she says because she was
feeling left out in the beauty community
and I was like yes I was not the only
one but I actually do really like it I
don't think it's like 100% needed though
because it's $34 for like a moisturizer
basically I don't think it's 100% needed
unless you need it for the reasons that
I mentioned why I really like it or you
know cheaper alternatives out there
though but for me I have been liking
this one so I'm actually really glad
because this was another one that I
thought if I don't like it like I hate
this I put it on my face it's a key it
smells bad it's anything look I'm taking
it back cuz that's $54 like that was
expensive I used a lot I'm gonna keep it
so this actually worked out for me so at
last minute I did decide to buy the
Tarte make believe in yourself as rush
said this is $39 for five different
brushes I send of will i buy it videos I
was going to pass over them because I
didn't think I like really needed them
and then during the báb sale I was like
you know what whatever I'm just going to
do it they look really cool they have
like the Unicorn gold handle
obviously really colorful these I kind
of have like mixed feelings about
because I like them I don't know if I
love them
I actually thought at first that I might
return them and then I use them a little
bit more and I was like no they're
actually good makeup brushes I think so
I don't know okay let me try to explain
so like for example this pink brush when
i salted I was like oh that's kind of
like really flimsy like surely that's
not going to do anything and I remember
the first time I used it I like was
jabbing it like crazy and my blush and
applying it because like it's not going
to pick up any products all blah no this
brush is actually really good with
lending brush though I don't think is
fantastic like it's just definitely not
the best blending brush that I've ever
owned an eye blending brush this is what
it looks like you can tell I've been
using it I've been trying it feels very
light and like again it feels kind of
flimsy and I feel like when I'm trying
to blend out the eyeshadows it's almost
like the brush is like dragging on my
eyes so it's not blending the best so
this one this one I didn't really love
so much the flat shader brush is just
kind of like I don't really know how you
can like go wrong with a flashing your
brush I don't that brush is just pretty
standard to me and then these brushes
this one is okay it's just not I guess a
brush that I feel like I really need and
I have like three other brushes like
this I think it's fine I've been using
it to stamp in contour on my face and
it's it's fine
again it's fine like it's a good brush
but it just didn't like blow me away and
then this guy I have used it again for
contour or to kind of buff in bronzer I
also used it for a highlight one day
just because I was trying to find
different reasons to use it for and
again it was fine to really this brush
was the only one that like really blew
me away
but the blending brush was the only one
that really disappointed me oh I don't
know those were kind of my thoughts on
it and I kind of thought for a second I
was like maybe I should return it
because $39 but I was like you know what
I like makeup brushes and you know
sometimes when you will lack and
cleaning your makeup brushes you just
really need like your backups to come in
handy and these could definitely be like
good back
well I don't help us to get enough
reason to keep them but they also do
look really cool but again this brush is
definitely my favorite as the bunch I
really do like it overall I just I
thought it was okay I don't think it's
like a must need rush set but I don't
think it's bad so I know if you like
crew unicorns if you loved her if you
love colorful things like yes you'll
probably get along with it just fine I
just don't think it's like the best
brush that I've ever owned
alright I'm from Tarte that I got this
is the rainforest of the sea water
foundation again I'll try to run quickly
through it because I'm pretty much
positive I mentioned this in my makeup
monthly for April and I put it in my
favorites section because I absolutely
love it I've been obsessed with it the
first time I tried it I bought it for
the next three days in a row or
something have a dropper type applicator
which it isn't my favorite but it's okay
just sometimes it can take me a while to
get the actual amount on my brush that I
want so that's like really the only
downfall but I love this foundation I
got mine in light/medium honey it's a
little dark for me right now but with
summer coming I figured this would be a
good summer foundation for me it's super
lightweight on the face again so water
foundation so it feels lightweight but
it gets a solid like medium coverage I
would say it has really really good
coverage it looks good gives my skin a
nice healthy glow I've been really
obsessed with this foundation so happy I
got it and the final item I got is
another foundation this is the hourglass
vanish to stick foundation I got mine in
the shade nude I knew I wanted another
stick foundation I mentioned a couple in
my wishlist video and I felt like a lot
of people had really good things to say
about this foundation and I'm really
happy with it this was another one that
I was a little unsure about in it I
think it was $42 versus the Tarte one
which I think was 39 so I was like or
you know if I don't love it I can take
it back or you can all that's not like
my perfect shape match but I think I did
a pretty good job actually picking out
my shade again it's probably like a
shade too dark but again for summertime
I think it will be fine but I really do
like this the only part that I don't
like is when I don't mix it with my oil
or like a really hydrating primer
because then I think it can look a
little bit too cakey on me but that's
just because I really don't like full
coverage like if you are a full coverage
girl
I think that you would like this but
it's not my favorite look on me but if I
mix up the hydrating primer or my first
olive oil I love it like love it love it
love it I've been wearing this a lot
lately it has great coverage and I think
it's a very very long-lasting I have no
problems wearing this all day so I've
been very happy with this foundation as
well and I'm super stoked because I
wanted to add a couple new high-end
foundations to my collection I have a
large drugstore foundations and I wanted
to test out a few high-end ones and I've
been very very pleased with both that I
picked up with the sale so yeah the
hourglass Spanish stick foundation was a
big win for me as well this will
definitely be sticking around in my
collection again so there's everything
