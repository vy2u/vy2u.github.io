excited to do today's video because it's
my support vib sale hall so excited to
show you guys a what I picked up during
the sale I just got my packages in so if
you're curious to see what I picked up
why don't we go ahead start hauling some
makeup so I'm not gonna lie I do have a
box here from Ulta as well so I am a
platinum member at Ulta and the day
before bab rouge could start shopping
platinum members got a 20% off coupon
sent out from office' that's also
available on prestige brands and I was
like yep I'm gonna do that 20% is
greater than 15%
I prefer all the rewards still is able
to use my Ebates got my package the same
day that I got my Sephora one that I
made my purchased the following day so I
thought that was pretty good I only
picked up the items that I could get at
all tub that were on my Sephora loves
list so I will go ahead and share those
first but I mean if you're gonna get an
extra 5% off and like I said I think the
rewards are better and Ulta I was like
yeah I'm gonna go ahead and do that okay
so the first item that I have here is
from Anasazi Beverly Hills this is one
of the bronzers that I was saying that I
wanted to pick up during my wishlist
video so it took me a bit to pick out my
shade because I think they have six
different ones and I finally found it
was it on the anasazi website they had a
nice little description like oh you know
if you're light to medium maybe use this
if you're medium to dark use this so
that kind of helped me out the packaging
is really beautiful I just got these
packages so I'm super excited about this
there is what the Anastasio bronzer
looks like I'm filming with lights today
because it's snowing obviously it's
April 18th
of course it's snowing so I picked up
the shade Thani and oh boy okay hold on
let me see oh there we go
okay so ooh okay so I think the
packaging looks really nice on these I
like that it comes with a mirror so
there is a tani
I think it's coming across a little bit
lighter on camera probably because of my
lights but it actually looks pretty dark
so hopefully this will be a good match
for me I mean I can swatch it but I
don't know I mean it's watching a
bronzer but okay it feels really soft so
there is
of taani so I'm excited to try these I
feel like people have been saying really
good things about the Anastasio bronzers
so I will try out
Thandi here shortly it's so excited and
then I also did pick up oh yes I got I'm
not kidding I just got these packages
okay but I did grab the mousse that I
wanted to pick up this is from living
proof it's the curl enhancing styling
mousse this was a recommendation from
Jessica Braun I've been seeing her
recommend this quite a bit saying that
she absolutely loves it and I do always
have a mousse in my hair collection and
I'm almost out of the one that I have
and I've never found one that I actually
wanted like repurchase so I figured I'd
give this a try and get the discount
with it I have been kind of
straightening my hair lately but if I
skip conditioner and put mousse in
that's when I can get curly hair if you
see me with like lion mane hair and
that's typically what I've been doing so
I wanted to get a new mousse some days
I'm just like lazy and I don't want to
be in the shower for a long time I don't
want to condition my hair and like oh
who has time for that so that's when I
like to just put mousse in it and then
my hair it's good to go for a couple
days so I'm excited to try that out and
then next appear the final item that I
grabbed from Ulta is the Too Faced
natural face valid I'm so excited for
this I feel like this is getting really
good reviews so packaging is really nice
on it I feel like this is getting good
reviews and I love face palettes and
this is kind of a big deal this is my
first to face purchase since and 2016 I
went on a little I don't want to say
boycott but I just I just went on like a
no buy from Too Faced for a while I
wasn't feeling a lot of their vibes I
wasn't feeling a lot of their releases
even so I just kind of stopped
purchasing from them but I've been
saying the past couple months that
they're intriguing me more with some of
their releases and I don't really see
any like weirdness going on anymore with
social media I don't think so that's
good when I saw the natural face palette
come out I put it in a way like video
and I was like I don't think I'm going
to be able to resist this one I almost
purchased it when it did like first
release and I was like don't do it
because you know the vib cell is going
to be coming up you might as well get it
with a discount so to get it with the
20% off at Ulta I was pretty excited
about that the packaging looks beautiful
very nice
it kind of has this like like a dome not
a dome but like a hump has a hump to it
which is interesting okay so let me see
hmm
that looks nice okay so we've got a nice
mirror here and then you have your six
different shades so we have some blushes
and highlights and bronzer shades this
looks really really nice okay I do want
to do some swatches just because you
know just just go by I'm curious ooh
there are the swatches from the face
palette everything swatched really well
it felt really good I guess that I feel
like I've been hearing good reviews on
it which definitely played a part in to
me deciding to purchase six I think this
guy's like forty six dollars I want to
say again packaging is beautiful on the
shades I look really nice the highlight
shades look really beautiful there's
like a pinky highlight and then also
more of a gold highlight it almost looks
like it might have some peach in it as
well umm the bronzer looks really
beautiful the sunny honey bronzer is a
matte bronzer that looks really nice I'm
not sure if this one is supposed to be a
bronzer it does have a lot of shimmer to
it so I'm not sure if that was just
supposed to be like a shimmer bronzer or
what I have a feeling I'm going to love
this blush it's kind of what I've been
into with my blushes lately it's like
it's like a deep neutral almost so I'm
excited the only the only one that I'm
not sure that I would play with a ton is
this pink one right here the pink wink
cuz that's a really really pink but
maybe in the summer time or maybe to
kind of mix it in with another blush
maybe I could make that one work but
other than that this looks really dies
so I'm excited so we will we will see
we'll see how I like the natural face
palette from Too Faced already so those
are all the items that I got from also
that we're off my Sephora loves list
now I have my Sephora bucks get into as
well I guess that these did come on the
same day no it's so funny because I
didn't know the UPS or FedEx or whatever
it was had come like the doorbell don't
ring or anything like Aries didn't alert
me and I actually walked out with areas
to get the mail because I was like I
think it said that they were coming
today I was like they must just been
delivered sometimes with Ulta it goes in
the mail box versus the like coming to
my door and I opened up the door there
was actually
packages on the step of Sephora Ulta and
then another package was there I was
like why didn't anyone from the Bell
come on man these packages have been
sitting out there let's just mean okay
so from a Sephora I did decide to pick
up this Lancome duo so it's the bi-facil
face makeup remover and also i makeup
remover I said in my recommendations
video that this is one of the best I
make removers I've ever tried ever and
I'm almost out of my bottle so when I
saw this duo I was like maybe I should
try the face makeup remover too if the
eye makeup one is that good
so they come in like the little mini
sizes here and this was $20 but I'm
excited to have another one of the eye
makeup removers I'll be curious to try
out the face makeup and see how it goes
okay so I did also get some skincare I
went back and forth so long over these
and at one point I had at one point I
had one out of my car and then I put it
back in my car but I removed the other
ones but at the end of the day I was
like you know what girl
you have been on I think I figured out
that between January and April I spent
$60 on makeup which i think is pretty
good and the majority of that purchase
came from me doing a video where I was
doing a collab video with a friend and
way of testing at each other's drugstore
favorites and I still was able to get
like a bunch of discounts on that makeup
and stuff so I have not spent a lot of
money on makeup and I worked really hard
and I said go for it girls so I got
these and I didn't purchase anything
from the Alta 21 days of beauty which I
thought was pretty good too so I ended
up purchasing at two items from Lula
Hendrickson they've been on my wishlist
I wanted to get them so I went ahead and
did it so this is the C rush brightening
gel creme this is their new moisturizer
so here is what she looks like
so it says three forces three forces
three sources of vitamin C and Rose of
winter extract Rose of winter that's
nice and supposed to be spring but I've
just been hearing a lot of people say
really good things about this
moisturizer and that it is nice and
brightening so I really I really wanted
to try it so I decided to pick that one
up and then the
that guy that I got this came back in
stock thankfully there was a bunch of
things that I wanted that was out of
stock when I was making my wishlist
video but they came back and stock right
before the sale this is the banana
bright eye cream I'm a big fan of eye
creams I'm a big believer in eye creams
so when I was hearing people say really
good things about this one and
especially how brightening it is on the
under eyes as well
I really wanted to give it a try and
like I said I don't know if I said it in
this video but if you're not new I
really enjoy Allah hendrickson skincare
I'm a big fan purchase and repurchase at
products from Lula Hendrickson
so to stock up on some of their skincare
and try some of their new products out I
was pretty into so this is the banana
bright eye cream with vitamin C and
collagen boost it so excited to have
some new goodies to try out from
electric s'en so next up I did get an
eyeshadow palette this is from huda
beauty it is the mob obsessions I'm so
excited about this I have the smokey
obsessions and also the warm Brown
obsessions and I really really wanted to
get the BOK because these are just like
my shades these are my tones I mean it's
something similar I have pretty simple
makeup on right now but again it's like
the pinky tones pink vibes so I was
super super attracted to this palette I
have the two other ones and I think that
they're really great quality I love how
small and compact they are I love that
they come with a mirror I think they're
super easy to travel with
big fan of these my camera was
overheating so I went ahead and did some
swatches when I was waiting for it to
come back so again I am filming I have
three lights on in my office right now
so I don't even like can you even see me
am I completely washed out I might be
but I've been trying to improve my my
lighting so I now have three lights in
my office but here are what the swatches
will look like everything's watched
really well these shimmers I'm so
excited to play with but I'm just really
excited to add another of the obsessions
palette and I saw a sneak peak that
apparently they're coming out with some
more so I will be keeping my eye on that
but pretty stoked to add this new
eyeshadow palette okay so I also picked
up from a Sunday Riley the influencer
foundation came in stuck I'm so excited
or it came it released on Sephora right
before the sale I thought it was
supposed to release at the end of
March and then it didn't look like it
did and then it finally came back I
think again it was like the day before
or two days before the sale it came back
and is so funny I had so many people
tagging me on Instagram and on Twitter
like girl that the foundation is here I
was like I'm gonna get it I'm super
excited about this so it's the
influencer foundation from Sunday try
lay it says clean along where foundation
I talked about this in a will about
video and I said I was attracted to this
foundation over a couple other new
releases because Sunday Riley is most
well known for their skincare and let's
see on the flap that says your skin your
results your brand so this is supposed
to be a foundation but it's supposed to
have like good skincare benefits I'm
pretty sure with something along those
lines and I was like okay I'm interested
in this one so here is what the bottle
looks like I picked up mine in the shade
140 it says light with neutral
undertones so hopefully that will be a
good match for me it says
natural-looking a long wear lightweight
feel set in matte finish and medium to
full coverage I'm so excited about this
to try it I so with everything that I
got what you guys want to see me do a
full face trying the majority of these
products because I got like foundation
concealer bronzer blush highlight
eyeshadow lip products like I feel like
I can do a pretty full face with
everything that I'm hauling this would
want to see that let me know it could
either be a first impressions or I don't
know if I would be able to hold off
though so I might have like some
feedback in it but if you'd want to see
that style of video just let me know so
it has a pump on here which is nice so
I'm excited hopefully the shade match is
OK for me but got it got it got it I
will be testing it out
so the concealer that I picked up is a
from Laura Mercier again I mention this
on at my wish list and this is the
flawless a fusion ultra longwear
concealer I picked mine up in 2n which
is supposed to be too neutral so this is
one that I actually took out of my cart
for a while I was like you don't need a
new concealer I'm testing you know a
couple new ones out so I was like you
don't need it you don't need it but then
when I was reading comments on my
recommendations in wishlist video a lot
of people said that they've been
- and they think it's really really
phenomenal so I was like I'm gonna put
it back in my cart so that's on you guys
but I'm excited to give this a try so
here is what the bottle looks like again
I got the 2n so we will see how this
works out I'm excited to try it looks
like a pretty standard kind of like flat
on both side doe foot applicator so
ready and then I just have a couple lip
products to share and that is it so I
have a lipstick here this is from a Kat
Von D it's one of the studded kiss
lipsticks and it is in bow and arrow
I've had this on my wish list for it the
longest time I really enjoyed her
studded creme lipsticks and she's
apparently now just kind of switched up
the formula but people were saying that
they still thought it was good so it
looks the same as the other studded
cremes I wanted to get bow and arrow
because I have the bone arrow liquid
lipstick and it's one of my favorite
shades so I wanted to see how similar
this one would be to bow and arrow oh
that looks nice that looks nice I still
have some eyeshadow swatches on here but
oh it feels creamy oh it feels nice okay
so there we go there is a bone arrow
from Kat Von D feels nice and creamy
it looks like bow and arrow the other
lipstick that I picked up was from well
as Beauty I knew I was gonna do it so
these are pretty expensive at 25 dollars
for a liquid lipstick but they're
phenomenal
they are super long-lasting they're
super comfortable and I'm really happy
with them I have three other shades
right now and I really wanted to pick up
another one at a discount so I got the
shade Cameron which I believe was a
light pinky nude the packaging on these
are pretty like no jokes and then here
is what the bottle looks like it's
really really nice really nice packaging
I'm gonna go ahead and do a swatch and
see what I think I love this shade oh
man that's so pretty
Oh Cameron you dog you okay there's
Cameron gonna love it gonna love it look
look look at my vibes look at my vibes
on my head Smitha
what shades do you like to wear I don't
know can you tell I'm way too
it over makeup you guys okay but so yes
this one is Cameron from a lawless
Beauty big fan of their liquid lipsticks
highly recommend but highly recommend
getting them at a discount because it is
pretty pricey so I'm excited to have
Cameron in my life right now but other
than that that's gonna do it for my
Sephora VIP smell haul I guess that's
gonna be everything I picked up during
this for Vav sale both from Sephora and
also those niggas may get a little of
that I like what they did there I hope
that you guys enjoyed it seeing what I
picked up again let me know if you'd
want to see that full face using all
these items as always with my house I'll
come back in about two weeks it might be
2 or 3 weeks and I will review
everything that I've been hauling so I
gotta get to trying these items out but
I'm really excited with my purchases I'm
excited to try everything out and see
how it all works for me but other than
