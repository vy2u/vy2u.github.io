today's video is going to be a full-face
get ready with me trying out the
products that I hauled from the Sephora
vib sale I posted this video a few days
ago I will have it linked down below and
I asked because I have basically
everything to complete a full face
I asked if you would want to see like I
get ready with me a style video and the
overwhelming majority of people said yes
so that's gonna be doing today so why
don't we go ahead and get started so I
guess I'd if you missed my haul video I
will have it linked down below but I'm
going it to be using the hooded Beauty
mob obsessions palette I have the new
Too Faced natural loves face palette a
new bronzer from Anastasia Beverly Hills
I'm also gonna be trying out of the
influencer foundation from Sunday Riley
at the flawless fusion concealer from
Laura Mercier and then I have two lip
options I'm not sure which one I'm going
to go with yet depending on how the eye
look turns out but those are some of the
products I'm gonna be testing out mostly
everything is gonna be a first
impression in today's video because I
just got my package in the other day I
have tried the anastasi bronzer once and
also the Laura Mercier concealer twice
so I can give ish feedback on it but
like with all of my hauls I come back in
a couple of weeks and I do review
everything so I know some people are
saying I think a follow-up review video
would be more helpful than the first
impressions but I will do that I do that
automatically with my hauls or first
impression videos I thought it could be
fun to just kind of get my thoughts on
it apply on camera show you guys how
they're applying and all of that so I'm
actually gonna start off with the eyes
and I'm using the huda beauty mop
obsessions palette like I said here's
what she looks like these are $27 you do
get a mere with it this is my third one
from Hooda Beauty I really really like
these palettes I think they're a great
value I really like the colors in here
and I know I want to play with some of
the shimmers so I want to go ahead and
do my eyes first I already got you
seemed in and got my ears on and I do
have eyelid primer on so coming into the
palette I'm just gonna take this white
shade down here with my mode of super
crease brush and I'm just going to apply
that all over the lid to set the primer
and then I'm gonna come in with this
pinky shade right here and the Sigma
e-40 everything that I'm using will be
linked down below brushes in
included so I'm going to work this into
the crease and I'm gonna try something a
little bit different if you watched my
last kind of tutorial style ish video I
don't really call my videos tutorials
does I don't know what I'm doing but I
was trying shades from a palette that
I've never used before and I was also
trying a technique that I'm not super
familiar or comfortable with and
honestly I got so much good feedback on
that video i but w almost did not get
posted I was really nervous about it
just because I was so not sure of what I
was doing so I was uncomfortable so I
was just kind of nervous about it but I
got a lot of good feedback on it really
that feedback kind of gave me like
encouragement and motivation to continue
to try new things
even if I'm on camera and even if I
don't really know what I'm doing sort of
thing so thank you guys because I'm
gonna try something a little bit
different today I've kind of been doing
this style a little bit more off camera
but I'm gonna see how I can do it on
camera and though I'm nervous because it
looks don't always turn out how I think
they're gonna turn out but we're just
we're just gonna go ahead and give it a
try so actually what I'm going to do
next is I'm going to grab this deeper
shade right here and I'm gonna use a
small brush this is a pencil brush from
bdellium tools and what I'm gonna do is
kind of like draw a line and the crease
here might look harsh for a little bit
but I come in and blend a little bit
later so I'm just kind of adding that
deeper color into the crease I'm gonna
take the same as Sigma brush I'm gonna
grab out this middle shade here the
brown and I'm just gonna kind of come a
little bit higher than I put that pink
then I'm just gonna kind of blend that
this is where I get a little bit nervous
so I'm going to come back in with my
concealer and I'm gonna kind of like cut
the crease I'm not great at this yet I'm
still learning but I'm gonna give it a
try so I'm using the colour-pop no
filter concealer and the morphe g20 so I
just put a bit of concealer on the brush
and then I'm gonna put the concealer
middle of my eye here I'm gonna look up
like everyone
those to do and then I'm gonna take the
concealer all the way to the inner part
of my eye and kind of drag it over to
where I meet that market that I made I'm
just gonna kind of fill it in here and
then I'm gonna put a shimmer on top of
that concealer that's about where I'm
gonna keep the concealer again I I don't
think I'm like an expert by any meetings
like this I wouldn't even say I'm like
advanced yet but I'm having fun doing
this and I feel like it makes the
shimmers like pop even more and I just
feel like it makes a cool effect here so
go ahead and do the other eye as well so
once I have the concealer placed on I'm
gonna come over with the shimmer trying
to decide which shimmer I want to do I
think I'm gonna do this one right here
and I'm gonna take my Sigma e55 and I do
have it sprayed with a some setting
spray and then I'm just gonna place that
over where I have the concealer feels a
little funny if you're doing an all pink
look because I'm currently watching the
live stream of the Royals they just had
their baby boy so exciting but I mean I
don't really know what what I really
know how I would not do a pink look with
this palette so there's that but I'm
just kind of taking my time here and
just making sure the concealer is fully
covered with this shimmer and then just
to make sure everything's blended I'm
just going to come back in with that
Sigma brush and do a little blending
that's where I'm gonna leave the eyes
for now I have just a little bit of
fallout underneath my eyes but nothing
too crazy but again that's why I wanted
to do my eyes first before my face so
I'm just gonna wipe that away and add
some face primer and then I'll keep it
moving but I do like to do some of my
face before I finish off the eyes so
we'll come back to that in a little bit
but I like to have like my foundation
with concealer I like to use my
concealer to help like clean up these
outer edges here and have it down before
I do any lower lash line work so I have
my face primed and now I'm going to come
in with the influencer foundation from
Sunday Riley I have mine in the shade
140 says it's clean long wear foundation
it's natural-looking long wear
lightweight feel science matte finish
and medium to full coverage does have a
pump on it so I'm just using a this is
an original beauty
under actually and I'm just gonna do a
few pumps there I don't know what this I
haven't tried this one yet so I'm not
sure how the shade match is going to be
but we'll go ahead and see so I'm just
gonna start to blend that onto the skin
this is a new foundation from Sunday
Riley and I just intrigued me because
Sunday Riley is known for their skincare
and this is supposed to be it supposed
to have like good ingredients as well
for your skin and all of that so I was
curious to give this a shot
cut I haven't used this yet so see when
I think of it I think the shade yes
especially on camera because I do have a
ring light on it looks really really
light so might not be the best shade
match just like one small pump more okay
it's kind of like a runny like it's a
very liquidy foundation if you can tell
my sponge there but I'm just gonna try
to build it up a little bit and see how
that goes I kind of struggled a little
bit with the shade match because I think
this one is like light with neutral
undertones or something like that but I
can't find a light medium with neutral
undertones everything else had an
undertone that I think wouldn't have
worked for me so I went with this one
but I might have to exchange a shade
especially if we're gonna enter uh you
know warmer weather and whatnot but I
don't know we'll see we'll see it's
blending out really easily on the skin
you know I came back just to build it up
just a little bit more it says it's
medium to full some dry skin and I'm
kind of noticing that it looks kind of
drier up here it's a little dry around
my nose as well I don't usually have
that huh it's a satin matte finish and
usually I stay I typically stay away
from Matt's foundations cuz they don't
love the way that they look on my skin
but when this one says satin matte I
thought I would still be able to give it
a try but um but I'll have to say you'll
have to say this is first time trying it
on and all that fun stuff and like I
said I'll come back in a couple weeks to
give my full review on everything so
I'll just have to see how it lasts and
all of that fun stuff I don't think the
shade match looks quite as intense
when I'm not in front of my ring light
but I do have that going so I think it's
kind of like making me look a little bit
lighter it's still pretty light for me
again I had the shade 140 if that helps
for shade match but we'll just go ahead
and see but I'm gonna put my concealer
on next so I got the Laura Mercier a
flawless a fusion concealer I've tried
this one twice and I really really like
it so here's what the applicator looks
like it's flat on both the sides there
and yeah I've been really liking this
one I have the shade 2n which is
supposed to be too neutral kind of is a
little bit yellow for me but that's okay
I'm just gonna do one side at a time
here but this was one I was saying in my
haul that I kind of I decided to take
out of my cart but so many people had
commented in that video saying either
you tried this concealer or someone you
know tried this concealer and they
really liked it so I put it back in my
cart and so far I'm really glad that I
did and use it just kind of clean up
these eyeshadows out here it looks to be
very full coverage which I like in a
concealer I like the shade I'm like I
feel like the shade match works pretty
well for me I didn't notice a lot of
creasing but it makes the under eyes
look very smooth so again this is just
gonna be my third time at trying it on
but so far what I've been able to tell I
think it looks really good and I think
it lasts a long time I got ready the
other morning at 9 o'clock to get ready
for my friend's baby shower and I didn't
come home until after 10:00 and my under
well and my under eyes still looked
really good but weird thing but I feel
like the wand is kind of bendy like did
you see when I did that like the want a
little bit on the bendy side and I feel
like it I feel like it's nice for
applying it to the skin it's kind of a
weird thing but there's something that I
noticed yes that's pretty good at
covering up blemishes as well so I'm
just gonna put a little bit over the red
marks and get one here my forehead too
but my camera was cooling down I went
ahead and set my under eyes with the
Laura Mercier translucent powder I've
been testing this one out so like I said
I'll keep trying out the concealer but
so far so good for me so I'm going to
bronze next there is a bronzer in the
Too Faced palette but I want to try this
one from Anastasia Beverly Hills I
picked up my shade and tawny and like I
said I did
try this once before so far just over
the weekend I gave it a shot
and I felt like it looked a little
orange on me so I want to try again just
just to see what's going on here I'm
going to use my sigma f30 and just go
ahead and bronze up the skin here and I
definitely need it cuz I do feel like
that foundation is pretty light so I did
feel like when I use it though I felt
like it was pretty pigmented I also felt
like it blended it fairly smoothly I
just wasn't quite sure on the coloring
I'm gonna be really sad if it's too
orange for me though because I was
really excited about these bronzers and
it's $28 for bronzer you know of course
I got the actually this one I ordered
from Auto so I got it for 20% off which
is awesome but still my makeup so good
on me not orange yeah I don't know I
just feel like the shade is not not
looking good
so other than the coloring which I'm
unsure about I like it
I'm just not sure if it's pulling two
armed on me but you want to move on to
blush and next I am going to come into
the Too Faced and natural face palette I
haven't used this one yet I think she is
a beauty so like I said we do with
bronzer shades in here but I really
wanted to give that Anasazi one another
try I'm gonna use a blush and a
highlight out of this one I want to use
this blush here in pinks and it looks
like a really pretty like deep neutral
blush I'm gonna use the Sigma f40 well
that's a really pretty blush it's
pigmented without being like too
overbearing and it's pink without being
like soup ink mmm I like that one one
who likes to do my highlight last like I
always do highlight and the lip and
that's how I finish off my look so I'm
gonna go ahead and apply my brows
off-camera I didn't pick up any new brow
pencils or anything so I'm gonna let my
camera cool down for a little bit and
then we'll come back to finish off the
eyes they browser on it so I'm going to
go ahead and finish off the eyes I'm
going to put some of this Urban Decay
24/7 glide on pencil in a heartless
ensue my waterline it's just a really
pretty like soft pink kind of metallic
pink and coming back into the
- palate I'm gonna use the first shade
that I put into my crease and I'm just
gonna use that same del iam tools pencil
brush and I'm just going to sweep the
slightly on the lower lash line I don't
mind if those two colors mix which is
why I'm using the same brush then I'm
going to grab a more feet and 5:07 and
I'm gonna pick up the shade here on the
end and I'm just going to also sweep
that on the lower lash line and kind of
blend those colors together then I'm
going to pick up this at first a shimmer
here with the morphe 36 and I'm gonna
pop that into the inner corner then take
the same brush and the white shade and
I'm just gonna kind of lightly run that
along the brow bone because sometimes
when I'm blending I can make the crease
shades go pretty high I am going to add
some lashes but that takes me a while
and I haven't picked out my style of
lashes and my camera has a little bit
more juice to it before it's gonna
overheat again so I'm gonna come back
into the Too Faced and natural face
palette and I am going to highlight
before I finish off the look so I'm
gonna go ahead and use a little bit of
satin sheets from the Too Faced palette
I'm gonna use at Delia tools I think
this is a tapered contour brush yeah
it's the 944 but I like to use it for
highlighting I'm just gonna go ahead and
add this to the cheekbones whew that has
a lot of gold in it actually more than I
would've thought maybe a little bit
extra I'm gonna add some starlight to it
as well and see mm-hmm that's pretty I
do have some texture over here which
it's it's highlighting because that's
its job it's okay because otherwise I
feel like that's showing up a really
well that looks really nice it doesn't
seem like it is too powdery or anything
mmm I like that I slide the brush down
the bridge of my nose and then the tip
of my nose mm-hmm mm-hmm I really like
that highlights nice so I'm going to pop
on some lashes spur my face and then
we'll come back and finish it off with a
lip color already so I added the morphe
chummy lashes one of my favorite pair of
lashes and I'm gonna finish it off with
a lip color so it was between Kat Von D
bow and arrow and then lawless Beauty
Cameron but Cameron is
of a pink nude little Kat Von D is more
of like a brown nude so I'm gonna go
with Cameron these lawless beauties
lipsticks are some of my favorites
they're super pricey though so I only
want to purchase them when I'm gonna get
some sort of discount on them but I'm
gonna go ahead and apply camera into the
lips after the lip color this is going
to do it for my get ready with me trying
out all the items that I picked up
during the Sephora vib sale to kind of
run through everything I love the action
of palette again the hood of beauty
obsessions palettes are not new to me
but I'm excited that the mauve palette
lives up to the smoky and also the warm
Browns I really like this pink look if
you are into pinks right now because I
am like it's just my vibe at the moment
pinks and mauve then that's gonna be a
great palette for you nation I'm a
little bit unsure about it kind of
looking a little bit dry in some areas
the color match I don't think is
absolutely like 100% but I don't think
it's like the worst thing either but
I'll just kind of have to see how it
wears throughout the day and of course
try it more than one time but I thought
it blended out easily on to the skin I
just kind of got to see you know I just
I just got to try it more of course the
the Laura Mercier concealer i'm really
loving today it's gonna be the third
time that i'm trying it out but i think
it's full coverage it smooths out the
under eyes i don't see a lot of creasing
with it i don't think i need to bake
with a loose powder i've just used the
laura mercier because i'm trying that
one out right now but even if i just
said it was like a pressed powder really
lightly i'm not finding much with
creasing and it seems to hold up really
well throughout the entire day the
anastasi bronzer and what do you guys
think i know like i said i have my ring
light on which sometimes can make the
lighting funny but i don't i feel like
when i first apply it it looks orange on
me but then like once i do the rest of
my face i feel like it's not as
noticeable but i'm not sure you can let
me know if you think I'm crazy and
you're like no girl but it's an orange
bronzer I would love to know again I
have the shade tawny I'm just a little
unsure about that one definitely needed
to give it a few more tries right off
the bat the Too Faced and natural face
palette really really impressed me I
thought the blush was really beautiful
and the highlights I think is super
stunning so I'm excited to try out more
in that palette and the lip color again
lawless beauty I am NOT new to their
liquid lipstick
and I think it's a fantastic formula and
I'm loving it the color of Cameron but
that's gonna do it for today's video
of course I'll be back in a couple weeks
here to give my full review on
everything that I purchase from the hall
I have a couple other skincare items as
well that I'll be reviewing in that
video that I am a testing out but I
thought it would be fun to try
everything on today and come up with
this pink makeup look other than that
that's going to do it for today's video
I really hope that you guys enjoyed it
and if you did make sure to give this
video a thumbs up I hope that you'll
also consider subscribing before you go
and I'll catch you guys in my next video
