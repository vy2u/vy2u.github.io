so excited for today's video because it
is finally gonna be my Sephora vib sale
haul knocking my camera over this box is
quite large but I'm so excited I finally
got my package in the mail it has been
so long
I ordered it since I was was just a vib
member not a Rouge member myself started
November 11th I placed my order right
away in the morning and then I freaked
out because I never got an order
confirmation which normally you get from
Sephora I didn't get my Ebates email
saying like about my cash back I never
even got a shipping confirmation email
and I'm like I know right right when I
got down into my office on Friday
morning I had my cart ready to go
everything was ready I checked out and I
was like did I hit like then I forget to
hit checkout was I sleepwalking like
what did I do wrong but I was able to
track it through Sephora and I got my
ebay it's nobody panic I just contacted
them but I know that you know when they
do the VIP sales that they get you know
really behind and you know they even say
on their like shipping will probably be
delayed so I get it but I was freaking
out so it took seven days to get my
package and I was so sad but I just got
it it is severely beat up it's crazy
because it sounds fragile on it and this
box is beat up but I'm so excited I'm
gonna show you guys everything that I
picked up at the VIP sale some things
are for me some things will be for a
giveaway some things I'm not sure if
it's for me or for a giveaway so I'm
just gonna show you everything that's in
my box because I'm not quite sure yet
what we're gonna do with all of it but
I'm so excited
I love the vib sale so excited to get
some good stuff and I know I have some
goodies in here for an upcoming giveaway
so I'm so excited so how we go ahead and
hop into it just gonna grab out from the
top hide the Box on the floor now it
does not fit on my lap I'm gonna keep
knocking my camera over if I keep trying
to do that but I was really excited to
get these I talked about them in my
Sephora VIP sale like a recommendations
video and it is from Tarte cosmetics
it's their pack your bags under eye
rescue patches I love under eye patches
I love them and everybody like raves
about these and since they're so good so
I was excited to get them so I picked up
a pair
only for me but I did pick up an extra
pair for it giveaway because I thought
if everybody loves them so much I might
as well put him in a future giveaway too
so really excited to try these out and
then I wanted to try this for a while
and I'm a big fan I'm like sets and
value sets you know what I'm saying so I
decided why not give it a try this is
from huda beauty it's the lip contour
set so inside it comes with a lip liner
and then two mini liquid lipsticks I
haven't tried any of her liquid
lipsticks yeah but I've been hearing
good things about them so I thought why
not so I got the shades trendsetter and
bombshell see if I can open this oh my
so the packaging you actually just slide
it open okay okay then so this is what
the inside looks like so you get like
the full-size lip liner and then too
many liquid lipsticks I'm a big fan of
mini liquid lipsticks because you don't
go through them all that quickly but I'm
just excited to be able to try them out
so I can do some swatches this one is in
trendsetter ooh that looks oh that looks
nice and they did have a couple
different colors on there that you could
choose from I think there was three
different like color combinations that
you could choose from so that one was in
trend center and then the other one is
in bombshell they're like these are just
like my colors you know so we have
trendsetter and bombshell they are
liquid lipsticks so they should dry down
matte but they obviously are still wet
right now
and then the lip liner is also in
trendsetter okay so this is what the lip
contour looks like so it's a lip liner
but they call it a lip contour and this
is in trendsetter as well that's really
creamy it feels nice I'm not a huge a
lip liner person I don't wear it a ton
but I like that I have the option and
I'll definitely try it with the trend
setter liquid lipstick as well but I was
just really excited to get I've been
wanting to try the hooda lipsticks I
think it's like twenty dollars for a
full sized liquid lipstick so I got two
minis plus the full-size lip liner and I
think this was $24 so figured that'd be
a good deal try it a couple different
shades and see what I think for these
next two are both gonna be for a given
so stay tuned but one is from Becca
cosmetics it's the blushed was a light
blush palette so I did talk about this
in my Sephora vib sale anti haul but
that's not for me I picked it up for the
giveaway but I even sent in the video
that I really would like this and I
think it's a great value and a great way
to be able to try out Becca blushes
which so many people love but I had my
eye on a different blush palette that I
wanted to get and so that's why I passed
over this one but I was like I truly do
think this looks pretty freakin bomb so
why not put it into a giveaway so this
will be in a future giveaway so stay
tuned for that and then also going into
the giveaway I picked this up from bite
Beauty it's the perfect bite a mousse
bouche lipstick set so it comes with
four mini lipsticks and I just hear
really good things about these from bite
Beauty I've never tried them myself but
again I love steps if you can't tell so
I thought to be able to get four in here
that would be really cool to try out so
it comes with fig pepper honeycomb and
nori again I'm not gonna do any like
swatches or anything because this will
be in a giveaway but yeah these two
items will both go into the giveaway
pile as well which is this in my
recommendations video but you know
stocking up during the support of VIP
sale and stuff that you really love is
always good because you're getting 20%
off in case you're not familiar with the
VIP cell is Sephora gives 20% off to
their VIP and vib Rouge members and so I
wanted to stock up on some of my
favorite skincare these are the facial
radiance pads from first day Beauty I
love these I got the big guide 60 pads
and I think it's $30 for the big guy I
love it I'm almost out of mine right now
so I was wanting to wait for the sale to
purchase them to get a bit of a discount
but these are just these are just life
so another set that I picked up this is
from Stila it's they're naturally nude
stay all day liquid lipstick set so this
is what it looks like if you can see it
through the glare so it comes with three
of their mini liquid lipsticks I can't
find what the colors are in here it
doesn't seem to say anywhere but I know
patina is one of them and Stila patina
like everybody was going crazy for and
so when I saw this set I was like you
know I've never tried any Stila liquid
lipsticks so I originally picked it up
for me but I think I'm
maybe put one into a giveaway I'm not
sure yet so I'm not gonna swatch
anything because I'm not positive I'm
pretty sure I'm gonna keep this for
myself or at least keep like one or two
for myself I don't know but I'm not
gonna swatch anything for that reason
we'll see it one of these might be in a
giveaway I might get selfish and keep
them all I don't know though this just
would be a really fun way to try out
some Stila liquid lipsticks okay and
then also some more from tarts I got
there friction stick again this was one
that I mentioned in my recommendations
video and I said that I really want it
so basically I mean I can open it up
because I know that I'm keeping it for
myself so this is what it looks like
when you take it out of the packaging
and I've just heard a lot of people say
really good things about it so that's
what it looks like that's like black it
looks kind of intimidating but it says
you twist basis stick until exfoliating
gel appears applied directly to damp
skin and then use your fingertips gently
massage all over the face and then rinse
thoroughly so I don't know I've seen a
lot of people using this and I've seen a
lot of people really liking it and I
need something new for my shower I'm
about to run out of like my exfoliator
that I usually have in my shower and I
like to always do some sort of like
skincare in my shower it's just like
time saver and it's easier to wipe
everything off and especially if this is
like black then it's kind of nice to
just be able to do it in the shower and
get it all rinsed away and done with but
really excited to try this out think
that I picked up for a giveaway is some
skin care for you guys and this is from
origins so again I love sets can you not
tell but the vib sales are really good
time to to pick up stuff for giveaways
because for the giveaways 90% of every
giveaway that I do is stuff that I have
bought like sometimes it's you know if I
get doubles that a company sent me but
it's not very often or sometimes like if
I get a beauty box and I know I'm not
gonna use everything I'll put it in a
giveaway but like I said 90% of my
giveaways are things that are buying
with my own money and they can get
expensive so that's why I wanted to pick
up quite a few items for the for my next
giveaway after the IV sale but this is
from origins and let's see it comes with
the Maximizer which is a skin optimizing
mask primer the original skin which is a
texturising mass with rose clay the
clear improvement active charcoal mask I
have used that and I loved it so much so
that I was really excited that it came
in there and then the drink up which is
an intensive overnight mask to quench
skin's thirst I've always wanted to try
the drink up but again this is what it
looks like so this will be included in a
future giveaway and I'm so excited
because like I said I did try the
origins charcoal mask and I loved it
I've heard great things about the drink
up mask - so look for this one in a
future giveaway ok we're starting to get
down there I wanted to pick up a Beauty
Blender
I mentioned this in my recommendations
video as well Beauty blenders are $20 so
if you can get them at a bit of a
discount I think that's a good thing I
decided to pick up the black one just
because I've never used the black one
and Ready Set glamour says that this is
her favorite one that's Michelle from
Ready Set glamour
she said that she thinks the black one
is like the bounciest or something and
that's what I really love about Beauty
blenders is how bouncy it is if you
watched my video on the Real Techniques
diamond sponge then I recently got I
talked about how my dog now has an
obsession with Beauty blenders and is
eating them so I've been waiting so
anxiously to get a new Beauty Blender in
because the only one I have right now is
my Real Techniques one and my peer one
which is she still took a bit of a bite
out of that one too so I need to throw
that one away but really excited and I'm
excited to try out the black one does
anyone else have the black one where you
think about it is it your favorites let
us know I've only ever tried the nude
one I haven't even tried the original
Beauty Blender all right you guys I'm so
excited are you ready I'm so excited I
don't know if you're ready I don't know
if I'm ready I can't believe I got this
she's here the modern renaissance
palette from august usnea i Ã´m g when i
saw this in stock when i was filming my
recommendations video i was like there's
no way this is still on stock it's
always out of stock there's no way right
and then the VIP room sale happened and
it was still on stock and I was like
okay by the time it gets to my cell it's
not it's not still gonna be that right
and it was and I was like no way but I
have ordered this modern renaissance
palette from Ulta before ordered it that
charged for it and
my order ships there was a note at the
bottom of my shipping confirmation that
said we're actually out of stock so they
refriended me my money back but I was
like why so I have not like I've told a
few of my friends like I ordered it but
you know we'll see I want to make sure I
actually get it in my box before I get
too excited about it but she's here and
it's like it's so soft I'm so excited so
many people love this palette this is a
very very very hyped about palette but
it seems to be for a very good reason
everybody says they love it it's not
limited edition I'm just so excited I'm
so excited to get it okay so to open it
up oh wow it looks beautiful okay I mean
I'm sure you guys have never seen this
palette before right like this is your
first time seeing it yeah okay it just
looks beautiful like I feel like I could
just sit and stare at this it comes with
a mirror which I absolutely love it does
come with a double sided brush which I
don't know if I've heard much about the
brush sometimes I like brushes and
palettes like the actual brushes and
sometimes I'm not very fond of them but
I'll give this one a shot and it does
come with the double-ended brush but be
doing you know my own makeup tutorial
with this I don't feel like anybody
needs like a swatch video on this
because it's not new and everybody's
gotten it I'm like the last person in
the world to get it but I'm so excited I
finally got it I'm so happy
oh I'm just I'm so happy so yeah my new
Renaissance and a 20% off I mean that is
a win okay so another thing that I got I
don't know if I'm proud of this or
ashamed might be ashamed but as I was
putting my car together for the vib sale
it said if you buy everything that's in
your cart now you're gonna be a vib
Rouge and I was like okay cuz it's
that's awesome to be a vib Rouge you do
get a lot of great benefits you get the
free like flash shipping which I believe
is the two-day shipping you get a shop
first at the VIP sales you get like
special events that you get to go to and
that sort of thing you get certain items
that
the Vav Rouge members can purchase on
Sephora there is a lot of great benefits
to being a VIP Rouge member but to be a
vib Rouge member means that you have
spent a thousand dollars in the year
that's the fora I just really hope my
husband does not watch this video and
hears me say that please don't watch
this Mitch if you're watching don't just
just forget I said just forget I said
that okay because that's kind of
horrifying when you break it down that
way you're like thousand dollars at
Sephora this year like wow that's a lot
of money and I'm you know I'm not really
trying to be one to complain because
free gifts are great free gifts are very
nice but you do get a VIP ruch gift when
you hit VIP rouge which again is
fantastic that's very nice the floor it
doesn't have to do anything for people
who hit vib rouge I mean they really
don't so inside this little guy let's
see it comes with a piece of paper and I
don't think there's really anything on
it it talks about so the vib rouge
benefits unlimited free makeovers at the
Beauty Studio first access to special
products and offers free shipping
private comes here phone number I can
call a vib Rouge exclusive events and I
have the Ivy Rouge status until all the
way through 2017 which is nice I do wish
this would have come with like I'm not
that coupon or something I mean it comes
with it sounds it comes with a free
makeover but don't I get in it just say
I get a free makeover for being a VIP
Rouge so why do I need a coupon for it I
don't know okay whatever whatever that's
fine so then they send you this gift and
what the VIP rears get is this NARS
blush in ghuli go lay I have no idea how
to pronounce it but this this is what
you get for spending a thousand dollars
at Sephora you get a blush that is that
big I mean again I'm not trying to
complain a free gift is great again
Sephora doesn't have to do anything for
people but this is just a very tiny tiny
little gift for spending $1,000 I mean
okay I mean it looks very pretty but one
thing that I kind of wish Sephora would
do if you hit vib Rouge or something
like that is like maybe half three
options and you get to pick like they do
for your birthday gifts like because I'm
not a huge blush person I've never tried
it NARS blush and this color doesn't
exactly scream me in blush so I'm not
even sure I'm really ever going to use
this I thought about giving it away and
I was like no don't give it away you
spent $1,000 for that blush girl don't
give it away like okay but so I'm gonna
try to use it at some point but I'm just
saying like I don't know I'm probably I
just I probably would have preferred
like a lipstick or something but I mean
that's fine it's thank you Sephora for
my vib Rouge gift you're welcome
we're spending $1,000 at your store oh
man that's a lot of money especially vib
Rouge all the way through 2017 I've also
hit all the platinum member this year as
well that's never happened before either
I have a problem and it is called
YouTube Thank You YouTube but yeah I
wanted to show you guys that so that's
what happens if you hit VIP Rouge status
at Sephora you get the NARS blush okay
and then the final item that I got I was
really really excited for it now I was
really hoping it was gonna stay in stock
I was worried it was gonna sell out but
it's one of the Sephora favorites and
it's the extravagant eyes so the Sephora
favorites I've talked about it on my
channel before but basically Sephora
will like pick and choose things like
this one is all about eyes so they pick
and choose like some like the best
selling products and they put it all
together and you can get it out of good
discount and so this one says it's a 134
dollar value and you got it all for $42
I'll be honest the reason why I wanted
them was for the huda beauty lashes and
then also the Urban Decay glitter liner
and I believe both of these are $20 on
their own and so to get them in here and
the whole thing is 42 and the glitter
liner is a full-size liner so I just
thought it was a really really good deal
so and then when you open it up this is
what everything looks like now some of
the things I know for sure I'm gonna
keep her myself so I'm not sure I might
do in a giveaway but like I said I knew
I was going to keep the Buddha lashes
they're in number seven Samantha so this
is what they look like and I actually
have the lashes already there on my eyes
today but they're like on their last
limbs so I knew I needed to replace them
so I figured why not to get this set you
get a bit of a discount and then also
the other thing that I was really
excited for in here like I said was the
Urban Decay it's their heavy metal
glitter liner and it comes in Midnight
Cowboy so this is what it looks like
I hear really good things about these
this was in my Sephora vib
recommendations video so when I saw it
in this set I was like okay I don't have
a lot of glitter liners because they
tend to burn my eyes but people have
been saying this one is a really good
one so we'll see I don't know if you can
see a swatch of that super great but I
will definitely be trying that out and
then also in here is from NARS it's a
dual intensity eyeshadow in Himalaya
this is what that one looks like again
I'm not a hundred percent I think I
might keep that one just cuz I've never
tried anything from NARS I haven't tried
their eyeshadow so not a hundred percent
but I'm leaning on keeping that one also
in here from milk cosmetics is an eye
pigment in silent disco I haven't tried
anything from milk it's a really like
hot upcoming brand it seems like I
haven't tried anything yet from them
there's also a mini Marc Jacobs mascara
this is their blacker
mascara so that's what that looks like
I'll probably keep it cuz I like my
scare of minis a lot and I haven't tried
that one from Marc Jacobs okay I can't
get anything out but there's also a
Sephora eyeliner in here as well looks
like a deluxe I think it's a Kohl
eyeliner that you get and it's in black
lace I'll probably keep that because I
always really like having black for my
waterline and I've recently lost my
other one I don't know where it went and
I'm very sad about that I can't get that
eyeliner out but then also from Laura
Mercier there's a caviar stick and plum
so I don't know that's what the
packaging looks like and there's what
that looks like I'm not gonna swatch it
again I'm not sure if I'll keep it for
myself or not but I've never tried one
of those
ether and then the last thing in there
from Smashbox is their 24-hour photo
finish shadow primer I have this and I
have a fairly new one it still has a lot
of product in it so I know I will put
this in an upcoming giveaway but a lot
of people really like it I like it
myself just trying to actually just used
it yesterday
it's a really good primer but I just
thought this was a really good deal I
really loved the Sephora favorites I buy
the kits quite a bit from them but I
just thought with especially needing new
lashes I'm wanting to try the glitter
liner and if I bought them separately
it'd be 40 dollars and spend an extra
two dollars and be able to try out a few
more products and have some for a
giveaway I thought that was just a
really great deal so that is the
extravagant I set from Sephora again
