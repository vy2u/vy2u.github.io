today's video is going to be all about
to the upcoming a Sephora vib sale I'm
going to be taking you through what is
on my love's list my wishlist what I am
hoping I can pick up at during the sale
or dissipating that I will be buying
during the sale and also giving a couple
of my recommendations as well and what I
would suggest for you guys to pick up
you know these videos I have so much fun
watching them I've currently been
watching all of the videos I love making
them a beginning asks a lot of questions
as I was making this video and I was
like yes of course some of my favorites
to make because everybody goes bananas
over the Sephora vib sale I got to my
card in the mail today so if you are not
familiar
during the vib sale you basically get a
percentage off during a certain amount
of dates so I am a Bab Rouge so my dates
start for me on Tuesday April 18th and
runs to the 24th if you are a VIP member
the sale will start for you on the 19th
and run through the 24th and if you are
a beauty insider the sale will start for
you on the 20th run through the 24th and
beauty insiders do get 10% off vib and
VIP rouge gets the 15% off i will have
all that information in the description
box down below as well as the codes for
all of the sales the only thing that you
need to do to be able to be a part of
the sale is to be a part of the Sephora
beauty insider program if you are not
yes i enough for that you do need to be
signed up in order to take advantage of
the sales and then there are the
different tiers the top tier gets to
shop first and then so on and so forth I
said I'm gonna take you through my loves
list what I want to pick up during the
sale and a few things that I would
recommend for you as well so why don't
we go ahead and hop into this I'm gonna
go through like categories I don't
really have a specific a way I'm gonna
do this I'm literally just going to take
you through my loves list and talk to
you guys about what I want to pick up
during the sale so we're gonna start at
the very bottom so one item that I've
been really interested in buying and I
feel like I do the Sephora vib sale I
try to buy things that I really love and
want to repurchase and I can get a bit
of a discount or buy things that are a
little bit more pricey to me and I've
been holding off on buying them so I can
buy them during the sale now 50% truly
isn't that much money off I mean it's
just not but everybody goes bananas over
the sill anyways I think a big reason is
because the four doesn't really do
they don't they're not like Ulta we're
very frequently you'll cup that 20% off
coupon or you have to 350 off $10 or
whatever Sephora doesn't really do that
they just have the VIP sales so people
go get pretty excited for it so I'm in
that category so one thing that I have
on my love's list is the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD invisible cover stick
foundation and you also have the
hourglass stick a foundation on there
and everything will be linked down below
I really didn't want to start getting
more into stick foundations I've been
hearing some good things about them the
only one that I have right now is the
Anastacio stick foundation and I want to
be able to try a couple other ones these
are both more pricey so I thought maybe
the sale would be a good way to be able
to try them out the hourglass foundation
is 46 hours 46 dollars and the make up
forevers is 43 dollars now I don't feel
like I need both so I'd love to get some
of your guys's opinions have you tried
either one of these would you recommend
either one I haven't tried a lot from
Make Up For Ever and I don't really
think I've tried anything from hourglass
so it's another reason why I would like
to expand and be able to try these I
just I don't think I'm gonna need both I
would need to pick one or the other but
they're both of my loves lists right now
and they're both kind of similar so I
thought I'd mention them together but
let me know if you've tried either one
if you'd recommend either one because I
would love to know your feedback another
foundation that I think I'm really gonna
pick up even if I buy the other
foundations I also I really want to try
more high-end foundations I mainly stick
with drugstore foundations because I
really like them I have the one Wilde on
right now and it was like 5 or 6 dollars
or something like that but I definitely
do want to try more high-end foundations
and I think it is important to step
outside my comfort zone and just be able
to try more and be able to give more
reviews and better feedback and I get
asked a lot of like comparison questions
does this compare to that and a lot of
times I have to say I don't know so it's
one of my goals to to get into more
high-end foundation but the one that I
really do want to try is the Tarte
rainforest of the sea it's the water
foundation and it is $39
I loved hard I'm such a huge fan of
Tarte I really like them as a brand I
like following them and seen their
snapchats and I just think I just am
very attracted to the brand I have the
rainforest of the sea Aqua concealer and
I really like it I think it's really
nice and I feel like a water foundation
for like spring/summer is going to be a
really good choice for me I think I'm
really going to get this one and then
maybe
one or two other foundations but the
Tarte rainforest of the sea this
foundation has been on my radar for a
very long time I've had it in my loves
us for a very long time so I think I
might as well just buy it
Oh items that I have on here that like I
said I like to repurchase as some of my
favorites during the sale just to get a
bit of a discount on them a Beauty
Blender i will probably repurchase a
Beauty Blender the nude and the black
are some of my favorites the beauty
blenders are $20 so definitely more
pricey so if you can get them out of it
but discount I think that's great the
cap on the everlasting liquid lipstick I
really enjoy those and I've been wanting
to pick up another color I know she just
released a bunch of nudes and I was
thinking about picking up one of the new
nudes
I have going arrow which is a beautiful
brown nude and I love it so I think I
want to get another one
again those are twenty dollars a little
bit more pricey the first day Beauty
facial radians pads I talked about these
like all of the time I'm always a
stocked up on these some of my absolute
favorite like has to be in my skincare
all the time if there's ever a sale at
first sight Beauty like sometimes they
go on sale Ulta or during the vib sale I
typically I'm always buying like the Big
Kahuna bottle because I really go
through these when I travel I take them
with me I just I've been using them for
so long and I always recommend them
couple of other liquid lipsticks that I
absolutely love the Smashbox always on
matte liquid lipstick I have only one
shade right now since stepping out it's
a beautiful brown but it is such a good
liquid lipstick formula super
long-lasting super comfortable I've been
wanting to pick up a second shade for a
very long time so I think during the vib
sale would be a good time to do that the
other liquid lipstick is the hood of
beauty and liquid lipsticks I have
bombshell on my lips right now and I
just adore this formula it's it's very
liquidy I don't like liquidy liquid
lipsticks then you're not going to like
this formula because it's definitely
like the most watery like what lipstick
foundation that I've tried but I think
that they will just work really well for
me and what I look for they're very
comfortable they're long lasting like I
said I have bombshell on right right now
I also own trendsetter
I love them both she also just released
a bunch of new nudes and I think there
was the one in
wifey that I'm thinking about picking up
but kind of one another nude as well so
those are a couple of liquid lipsticks
there and
the tart under eye rescue patches I
still have some I haven't gone through
my box completely but I know that I love
them I'm a big fan of anything like
under the eye so they're $22 and they're
just a bit expensive for under eye
patches during the sale could be a good
time to get a refill of these and
another item that I still have on my
love's list I never actually took it off
as the anastacio Beverly Hills and
Modern Renaissance palette it's in stock
it's for right now this has been such a
hyped about palette it's not new or
anything like that but everybody still
loves this palette I love this palette I
would still recommend it it's $42 if you
guys have not jumped on the modern
renaissance palette train yet the vib
sale is gonna be a great time to do it
it was actually the last vib sale I
think it was unlike November that I
picked up the modern renaissance palette
at 20% off and I was super happy about
that so this is a great time if there's
any like eyeshadow palettes more
expensive pellets anything like that
that you've been eyeing but you feel a
little bit guilty about the price don't
feel as bad because you're getting
you're getting a discount and then
you're getting your points and you know
it's all good it's all good I know I'm
usually the one over here saying like
will I buy it and I'm not gonna buy it
for this reason I'm not gonna buy for
that reason and then the VIP sale comes
and I'm like let's just buy it all yes I
need for more liquid lipsticks in one
trip why not recently was able to try
out some sheet masks from too cool for
school I believe they're kind of a newer
brand to go into Sephora they have a
couple different face mask options and
there's six dollars apiece for each
sheet mask which i think is kind of
pricey so if i can get a bit of a
discount I'm not gonna be mad at that
though they have an egg cream mask for
firming and then also a egg cream mask
for pore tightening I have both of them
in my loves list might right now I might
just grab them both because I really did
like these sheet masks I was very drawn
to them or skincare that I am super
interested in but it's super expensive
is from Sunday Riley it's the good jeans
all-in-one lactic acid treatment it's
one hundred and fifty eight dollars I
mean even at 15% off that's still quite
pricey but so many people have been
saying really good things about it a lot
of people have been saying it's really
good for texture which I can that
struggle with texture at times and I
don't know but I saw my friend Katie
from my vanity I think she used this
and she wasn't having like a great
experience with it so I'd really love to
get your guys to speak back to you has
anybody else tried it it just seems like
a lot of money to spend on skincare and
if I don't like it that's gonna suck
really bad so I would love to know I
just I feel like I've been hearing
really good things about it from like
the really big Beauty tubers but I feel
like I haven't really heard a lot else
from anybody else so I don't know let me
know if anybody else has tried this but
I mean I'm definitely gonna have to buy
it during some sort of sale because I'm
I'm not about to pay full price for that
that's insane but that's that's on my
list so more skincare is from coke re so
Sephora has a coconut multitasking kit
on there
it's $38 and I'm just I'm super curious
about this I've been hearing a lot about
cope re especially I think I first
started hearing desi Perkins talk about
it and then a lot more people have
mentioned it it comes with the coconut
sheer oil a coconut body glow a coconut
balm and a coconut minnie melts you know
might be something interesting to try
out you get to try out a couple of
different products in there for $38 like
I said I've just been hearing a lot
about the brand and if I can buy some
sort of set like this where I can kind
of be able to try a bunch from the brand
but without spending as much money I'm
into that idea so has anybody else tried
coke REE and what did you think of them
this is a total and complete Instagram
buy if I'm going to purchase this it's
because Instagram made me buy it but the
brand for Sally totally and probably not
saying that correctly but they have a
couple of elixirs so they have a rose
gold elixir and then a unicorn essence
okay let's just like take a moment and
think about that one is $54 and then oh
they're both $54 okay I don't really
know the difference between them one is
it rose gold a lexer one is a unicorn
essence I'm assuming like someone found
the guy unicorn horn
and then like shaved it and then put it
in this that's what that's like my best
guess so looking at this for website on
the unicorn essence it says it's an
innovative water-based dual purpose
serum which helps protect the skin from
free radical damage while preparing it
for makeup application just everybody's
been using this on Instagram like you
just see people like spread
all over their face and putting it all
over the beauty blenders like bathing in
it like dropping it on their head I
don't know it's just like crazy
it's definitely blown up on Instagram so
of course I put it on my loves list
right away I don't know why I think I
need this I probably I probably don't
need this but I feel like I should have
it to be a part of the community I feel
like I shouldn't put this in a will I
buy a video maybe I could have talked
myself out of it has anybody used these
do you think I need them do you think of
being crazy I mean just holler at me
just let me know feel like I've been
seeing so many people use it and that's
when I put it on my love's list and it's
just been sitting there because I'm like
I don't want to spend $54 for something
that I'm really like very unsure what it
is but now that the vib sales coming up
I've gone back to and I've been like
should I just go ahead and buy that
should I
I have a couple of items from tatcha on
here because tatcha is super expensive
so like yes please I need a discount if
I'm going to buy something once again
they have a set on there and I'm telling
you guys I truly feel like sets are a
really good way to go
not only with skin care but also makeup
or if you can buy like minis travel
sizes it's so hard to go through items
like it really is really hard to go
through things so a lot of times if you
can get something smaller and save a
little bit more money it just it just
seems like a win-win you know so Tasha
has the bestseller set which is $59 and
it's an exclusive four piece set of
bestsellers that offers a timeless
beauty ritual to reveal brighter
smoother baby soft skin okay but inside
it has the pure one-step chamomile
cleansing oil which I've heard good
things about the polished classic rice
enzyme powder and the supple moisture
rich silk cream and then the luminous
dewy skin mess which everyone's loving
the dewy skin mist as well again I mean
it's a little bit more expensive for
four products but tatcha is definitely
like I would say more of like a luxury
brand they're super super pricey so to
be able to try out a couple different
items I feel like that would be a good
thing and then the other item that I had
from Tasha on here was the water cream
which is $68 for a cream okay it says
it's an oil-free anti-aging water cream
that releases a burst of skin improving
Japanese nutrients powerful botanicals
and optimal hydration for poreless
looking skin I've been seeing everybody
like desi and Katy and they would have
in there
hotcha facials and then they're freaking
out over this water cream and everybody
loves the water cream it's like so
amazing and I'm like obviously I need it
do I really need it I don't know but
like I just turned 30 so when I hear
things like anti-aging and I'm gonna
make your skin baby smooth I'm like I
haven't been a baby in a really long
time so maybe I should think about it
but again I would definitely need to
purchase from tatcha during some sort of
sale I would not be able to pay full
price for it because I just can't do
that to myself I love myself and my
wallet way too much so I'm thinking
maybe during the sale I can try out some
tatcha so another skincare brand that is
more pricey but I've been interested in
trying is drunk elephant they have a
rising glow set and then also a nitrite
set the rice and gloves $23 the nitrite
is $28 you get two products in each and
again I believe they're smaller products
and you just get it a way to test them
out so I put both of my love's list
because I haven't decided which one I
would want to pick up probably the
rising glow maybe I don't know
I hear really good things about drunken
elephant again but again they're just
more pricey but this is why I'm
considering it during the vib sale if
anybody's tried drunk elephant there's
anything that you love from them please
let me know and I'm definitely
considering them so I put this on my
love's list as well but Sunday Riley has
a what is it called The Sunday school
skincare set it's $60 but it includes
the thing that I had on my love's list
from like way back so this set includes
micro dissolved cleansing oil a protect
and repair moisturizer at the good jeans
all-in-one lactic acid treatment and the
luna sleeping night oil so I think I
would definitely get this instead of
just getting the 158 dollar treatment or
whatever I would get a set so that
actually has me really excited see this
is what I did like my loveless is so big
that I forget what is on my love's list
and I just like double add things like
that's a lot of control my list is that
has me really excited so I feel like
maybe I could just try that instead and
then be able to see how much I like the
brand moving back to some makeup I think
that's gonna be everything for skincare
so moving back to some makeup that I'm
interested in I put the Kevin Kwan
contour duo on the bow on my love's list
a while back it's $25 I recently got
really really amazing a PR package from
Kevin a Quan and I mentioned it I
believe it was in a video that I talked
about it and I got a lot of really good
recommendations from people but a lot of
people said this contour duo is is
really really good so I put it on there
it's only $25 I mean I think it's more
of a little guy if you get yeah you get
a contour and then a highlight so a
bronzer and a highlight and I'm really
interested in trying more Kevin a Quan
like I said what when they sent me the
package I was able to try out a few
items and I was really impressed with
everything that I was sent so I know
it's definitely more of a luxury brand
but $25 I didn't think is like a really
bad price and then you get the discount
too so I love contour and bronzer and
highlighting and all of that so I just
feel like we would get along really well
so I think I'm going to pick that up I
had on my love's list the Tarte make
believe in yourself I had cheek palette
it's $40 it's new from Tarte cosmetics I
had it on my loves list I almost bought
it during the Tarte friends and family
sale like I really wanted to pick it up
I just knew I wanted it to like maybe be
at a discount cuz I've so many eyeshadow
palettes lately I actually received it
as a birthday gift from my friend Lisa
if you guys saw my latest haul video I
went through some of the birthday gifts
that I received from some of my sweet
sweet friends and social media family so
I have the palette which has me so
excited but like I mentioned if there's
any pals that you've been eyeing and you
just weren't sure about the price maybe
consider them during the sale totally
random but I have on here at the Tarte
Pro little lash helper lash a p-- Lakai
tur it's $14 for a lash applicator
basically and I just feel like I need
one I'm using my tweezers but my
tweezers are so sharp that I'm seriously
afraid I'm gonna poke my eyeball out one
of these times so I've been wanting to
get some sort of actual lash application
because especially with me having nails
now I just feel like it's easier to have
a tool and I feel like a lot of people
talk about this Tarte guy like have you
guys heard of it do you have it do you
think you need to have it it's been on
my loves list for a very long time
because I've heard people talk about it
and I think I'm gonna get it I think we
are nearing the end guys I told you like
I don't play around with my loves list
so this was a recommendation from racial
love so I was watching one of her videos
the other day and she I think she did a
first impression
the YSL shock volumizing mascara and she
says she loved it she was totally blown
away by it her lashes looked fantastic
$29 so been expensive her mascara by
nacelle but I'm really attracted to
higher-end mascaras I don't buy mascaras
a ton because I normally wear false
lashes but what I'm not I tend to
gravitate towards higher-end mascaras I
just think that they work better versus
drugstore so I'm seriously considering
adding this to my mascara collection on
here the Stila magnificent medals the
Magnificent medals glitter and glow
liquid eyeshadow the Stila glitters that
everybody's gone crazy about I mentioned
this in a past reliant video and I said
that I wanted to buy them but I wasn't
sure because there seemed to be such
mixed feedback about it and I said maybe
I would wait for the vib sale so I have
it on my loves list and I'm still trying
to decide I just feel like it's so hit
and miss and you know the really nice
thing was Sephora is if you buy
something and it doesn't work out you
can return it I mean it has to be within
so many days with your receipt you know
you can't return a foundation and it
only has this much left that sort of
thing but that makes me feel a little
bit better especially when you're buying
something that's twenty four dollars and
it's like what if it doesn't work out
for you and you just hate it no I don't
know I just feel like it's so mixed
people either love them or hate them so
I don't know but it's on my love's list
I have on here a set from Tarte I love
sets this is the mother nature's miracle
discovery set its $38 and inside you get
seven items the deep dive cleansing gel
which I hear really amazing things about
the rainforest of the sea setting mist
which I've never tried the underlying
rescue patches which I've already said I
loved the maracuja aisle which I've been
wanting to try for a really long time
one of their splash hydrating lipsticks
which I'm hearing phenomenal things
about that should be on my love's list
those splash lipsticks because I'm
hearing amazing things about them and
Amazonian clay blush I recently just
finally tried out my first her blush and
it was fantastic and also one of their
lights camera lashes four and one
mascara I definitely have my eye on this
I need more tart in my life so I think I
need to get that one more thing I put on
here from Tarte two is the make believe
in yourself' magic wands brush set it's
thirty nine dollars instead of my will I
buy a video that I wasn't going to buy
the
and then for some reason I can't get
them out of my head like I I I don't
know what my problem is I love makeup
brushes I love buying makeup brushes
like I just feel like makeup brushes are
good buy
because you use them all of the time and
I don't mind having extras of the same
brushes because girl can't clean makeup
brushes every single day I love having
extras or duplicates or Dubes or
whatever of my favorite makeup brushes
so these come with five they just look
they just look cool like I said I liked
art and now gonna have the eyeshadow
palette I feel like I should have the
brush set to go with it right we are
down to our last few items so one thing
that I did have on here was the Marc
Jacobs beauty that there Highliner matte
gel eye crayon pencil they're $25 apiece
I love eyeliners send it in a lot of my
videos that I just really like eyeliner
because it's what I wear every single
day like some people you know you need
that certain thing for your eyelid to be
complete you need something on that you
know you you'll be a comfortable leaving
the house with for me it's eyeliner so I
love eyeliner when I saw these come out
from Marc Jacobs I wanted them so bad
$25 for an eyeliner it's really pricey
again I mentioned in my haul video that
my sweet friend Lisa
gifted two of them to me so I think I'm
actually just gonna wait try those out
I'm saving them for a first impressions
video but I'm gonna use those so now I
don't need to purchase them for myself
but I had my eye on them
I hear fantastic things about them so
definitely a recommendation to you guys
I have a couple brow items on here from
benefit one is the Bravo conditioning
primer nutrient rich eyebrow primer it's
$28 and it's supposedly it's supposed to
help make your eyebrows grow and you
guys know I'm not a big brow person I've
complained about brows so often in the
past like we probably all know that
story but it's so funny to me because of
the comments that I'm getting lately is
that like I over plucked my eyebrows in
the middle I do not pluck my eyebrows
like I don't I can I truly cannot recall
the last time I plucked my eyebrows
besides like if they are right in the
middle at unibrow style or if they're
like way over here or something crazy
like sure I'll pluck them but otherwise
I just leave my friends alone but people
are like oh you don't have enough I
don't whatever
one of the most of random comments to me
with someone said for your eyebrows to
look more natural you should fill them
in and you
dupa mate and you should make these
strokes and you should do this then you
should do that and I'm like so so not
natural is what you're saying
like I just I don't understand when
people are like you need to look natural
and by doing that you need to completely
change yourself that is not natural I do
not understand nobody will keep saying
that so I'm like I don't know maybe if I
use the primer that helps your eyebrows
grow like maybe like this brow is super
sparse compared to this brow so like
maybe it would help fill this in and
maybe I could get some hairs in the
front here so people can stop telling me
that I don't natural so that's how my
list and then the other thing is that
precisely at my eyebrow pencil I hear a
lot of really good things about this I
got the goof proof pencil but I've been
wanting to try the precisely my brow so
I can understand and let people know
what the difference is between the two
and I've also heard precisely my brow is
good for like filling in the front of
the brows which apparently is what I
need to do so thank you for everybody
for letting me know I have those on my
loss list so thank you very last thing I
put on my loves list is from it
cosmetics it's the your skin but better
CC cream
I just recently tried a deluxe sample of
this guy and freaking loved it it came
on my caller ID on vacation with me and
it's what I wore very frequently because
it's lighter than a regular foundation
but it still gives amazing coverage and
looked really good on the skin that was
