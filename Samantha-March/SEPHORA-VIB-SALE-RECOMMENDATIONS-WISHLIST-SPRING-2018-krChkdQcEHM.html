during the sale and then if you also
want to hear a few of the items that are
on my wish list for the sale won't we go
ahead and get started so first up in
case you have not heard the dates and
I'll put this into my description box

it just kind of depends on your tier
within the Sephora rewards program I'm
pretty excited for the sale I've been on
a pretty firm a low buy for almost four
months now so the vib sale is gonna be
like one of the first times I'm really
letting myself shop again so I'm excited
to share my wishlist but first I do want
to share some recommendations I feel
like sometimes these videos I love doing
them but it's so hard to narrow down
what I want to recommend because there
are so many recommendations I could give
but I narrowed it down to well I mean I
have quite a list here so let's let's
just get into it but a lipstick that I
want to recommend these are from the
Sephora collection so these are their
lip stains or their other cream lip
stain I have the shade here in pink tea
and I'll do a swatch of it I love it
I've been wearing this one recently and
I think that it's really beautiful these
are $14 there is pink tea I am filming
with ring lights because it's dark
outside of course and snowing because
it's spring time but please liquid
lipsticks I have found to be really
long-lasting there are $14 which I don't
think is a bad price and I've just been
very impressed with these I've been a
raving about them recently a foundation
that I've had on my love's list for
quite some time myself as the Laura
Mercier a flawless a fusion foundation
it is a $48 I actually got a mini of
this I think it was actually last summer
and I wore it out a ton and I absolutely
love that foundation it's a very full
coverage which I personally don't enjoy
a ton but I got on with that foundation
so well I thought it wore really nicely
I thought it looked really nice on the
skin especially for our full coverage of
foundation I was really impressed with
it so I've had it on my loves us for a
while to possibly purchase a full-size
whenever a vib sale comes up I always
look at that foundation like should I go
ahead and get that that full size but I
think what holds me back is that I don't
wear full coverage a ton so I'm like
should I spend forty eight dollars for a
full size I'm just not sure but if you
love full coverage foundations I would
highly recommend that one from Laura
Mercier I thought it was great another
foundation that I would recommend and
that I have on my personal lovelace is
at the new NARS radiant long wear
foundation I believe is what it's called
I have mine in the shade right now doula
fill I think is how you pronounce it and
it's a little light for me and
especially going into warmer months I've
considered picking up I think it's is it
Punjab but that is my color match from
Sephora I can't remember now but I
really do like this foundation and I
would recommend it and like I said I
think I want to pick up a second shade
because I feel like I would wear this a
lot especially in the warmer months it
is full coverage but I think it looks
really nice on the skin it wears really
well once again I like the way it
applies and I just like the finish of my
skin when I wear this foundation the
only thing is that I wish I had like a
slightly better color match even even
just a little bit better of a color
match so it's $49 but I really think I
should get I really think I should get
my shade because I do like this
foundation quite a bit some eyeshadow
palettes that I would recommend are the
huda beauty obsessions Palace these are
her little mini pellets which are twenty
seven dollars each I have two right now
I have the smoky and then also the warm
brown and I love both of these I think
that they are so pretty if you love
these warm tones and these beautiful
like orange e and red shades and that
beautiful gold glitter I think that you
would love the warm brown and then smoky
obsessions I think this was the first
one that I got I actually got it for
Christmas and has so many beautiful
shimmers in there and a ton of matte
brows and you even have a black this
silver like shimmer glitter is really
really beautiful I would highly
recommend these they have a mirror
they're easy to travel with but they're
very pigmented
was on the fence about these actually
got these both as a gift I was on the
fence about these for a while but I'm
really glad that I have them and I
actually do have the moths palette on my
wish list I really want to pick it up
during the sale but as of right now it
is sold out so I'm like please come back
please come back for the sale cuz these
are really good be more eyeshadow
palettes that I would recommend to I did
review of fairly recently it was in a
video this week the Natasha Dena mini
sunset palette this is 25 dollars not 24
like I kept saying in that video but I
have been so impressed with this
eyeshadow palette someone who has
similar makeup vibes to me and a you
love these colors but you like being
able to go into a palette and kind of
know immediately what look you're gonna
create things that you would really like
this palette
they're very pigmented the shimmers are
absolutely beautiful I love all the
colors in here and I love that this is a
palette that I will use all of the
colors in here like that that to me is
really cool so this palette for the $25
and then especially with the 10 to 15
percent off I think that would be a
great steal and then also from that same
video the Anastasi Beverly Hills a soft
glam palette I mean soft glam modern
Renaissance I would recommend both from
Anastasia Beverly Hills but I have been
loving the soft glam palette these are
totally my tones I'm getting on so well
with this eyeshadow palette between the
mattes the shimmers I love the color
selections in here I think it's a
beautiful palette it's $42 so if you can
get it at a discount I think that would
be pretty sweet primer that I have to
recommend I've been raving about this
one you know I'm gonna talk about the
Smashbox the photo finish primer Iser
I have a little mini size here I don't
know if you can get the mini on Sephora
if you can it's $15 and it's actually
better to get the mini if you think
about like cost per ounce or something
like that people were telling me but I
purchased my mini on the Alta website
and the last time I looked at Sephora I
couldn't find the mini the full-size is
in the $40 range I want to say let me
have it on my list
yes $42 for the full size but this is
just a bomb primer it makes your skin
look so hydrated and just so good and
just with every foundation that I wear
practically combine it with this primer
it just everything looks so good on me
so one of my favorite primers I did
notice that Marc Jacobs has quite a few
sets I always recommend like sets during
the vib sale to are just in general
so for favorites
has really good collection sets out
there with their lip products also with
mascara if you're a perfume person they
usually have a perfume collection out
and I think it's a great way to try out
products try out new brands try out new
formulas new scents and things like that
so I always recommend those or any other
sets you can find that are maybe like
more like brand sets but Marc Jacobs
Beauty they have the cream and sugar
nude lip trio so you get three lip
products for twenty-five dollars and
then they also have one other set here
that I thought I wrote down maybe I'm
crazy yes the enamoured gloss set where
you get four of these mini lip glosses
and it's $32 I would highly recommend
this set too because I love these Marc
Jacob lip glosses I have this one here
in sugar sugar and that's it like I said
you get four minis for the $32 these are
really expensive for the full-size I
know because I've purchased the
full-size during a VIP sale one year
they're very expensive and honestly you
get so much product and if you're not a
huge lipgloss lawyer like me it would
take you a long time to run through
these minis and if you get four for the
$32 I think that's a great price so I
love my sugar sugar glass keeping on the
mini theme one of my favorite liquid
lipsticks formula is from hooda beauty
and she puts out a lot of minis as well
so right now there are new sets that she
just released their $33 for four mini
liquid lipsticks and again I love this
liquid lipsticks I have so many minis
because I purchased the sets so often
again I have a really large lipstick
collection I'm very rarely going through
an entire lipstick so minis being able
to try more colors I just think is a
great deal so there is a new one new
sets that she just came out with and I
have my eye on two of them I want to say
it's the pink and the nudes that I'm
pretty hard but I I just enjoyed these
liquid lipsticks so much I'll do some
swatches here of some of my favorites so
I have one in whyphy where if you watch
any of my lipstick videos like lipstick
favorites my lip picks videos you're
usually seeing a lot of food a beauty
mentioned and then this one is in sugar
mama these are just two of my favorites
at the moment I think they're beautiful
and again I just really like this
formula so we have a wifey and then also
a sugar mama another newer favorite
liquid lipstick formula of mine that I
would recommend but
I would recommend buying when you can
get it for a discount so the vib sale is
a great time these are the lawless of
beauty at liquid lipsticks I really
enjoyed this formula I put it in a
makeup Bunkley in my favorite section I
am just like super hyped about these
lipsticks in my lip pics video I think
you saw me there was like five different
days I think it was for February where I
wore a lawless Beauty lipstick and then
even in March I think lawless booty was
mentioned at least twice in there so I'm
a big fan of these lip products so I'll
do some swatches of these as well so you
can see what I have but these are $25
liquid lipsticks which is why I say to
get them at a discount because $25 that
is really really high and honestly once
a lawless Beauty came into Sephora I was
like yes I'm totally gonna buy a liquid
lipstick and then I was like just think
about it you know that the IV sales
coming up though that you can save some
money and just just wait for the sale
like you're not short on lipsticks by
any means because $25 is just pretty
pricey so here we have Leo which is a
nice peachy nude and then we have George
which is more of like a true nude and
then over here is Dane which is kind of
like that vampy dark burgundy color but
they are really beautiful they smell
great
apply great and they last for a really
really really long time so I think that
these are great liquid lipsticks I wish
they weren't so pricey but I want to
pick up another shade at least one other
shade during the VIP sale as well cuz I
really do like them but I just like I
just don't want to pay $25 for a
lipstick you know I just don't
almost finished up with my
recommendations I have a two more
foundations I would recommend one is the
Lancome this is the tinted Zola
foundation and this one runs for forty
seven dollars this is one of my favorite
foundations I got it because people who
are raving about it on YouTube and I
totally understand why it's a really
nice medium coverage at foundation it's
very long-lasting and it's just one of
my absolute favorites I have it in two
different shades because I love it so
much
another one that I actually purchased
during I think it was the last div sale
or the one before that this is from a
Dior this is the Dior skin forever
foundation this one is more pricey it is
$52 I believe so this one is definitely
pricey I've been wanting to get it
because again I was hearing people talk
about it so much but I
really wanted to wait for the VIP sale
this one is more medium to full coverage
but again it is super long-lasting and I
think it looks so good on the skin this
is another big favorite foundation of
mine so both are pricier both I'd
recommend getting for a discount also on
my list I want to recommend at these
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on pencils now
typically in my Sephora VIP
recommendations video I am always
recommending the Marc Jacobs highliners
there are $25 they're very expensive
there's still some of my favorites and I
would still recommend them but seriously
these are like a surpassing those liners
for me they're not that much of a
discount at only $20 but still there are
little bit cheaper than the Marc Jacobs
they have a ton of different colors and
I just I am so impressed with it deep
end is the one that was chosen as the
winner in my March find the series if
you watch that when I did a full face
using my subscribers most voted on
makeup products and a deep end won they
are just so beautiful and I just
recently got this one here in heartless
and I feel like it's gonna be really
similar to the Marc Jacobs that I had
been wanting to pick up it was called
like soft pink or something like that I
feel like this one is gonna be fairly
comparable to it so I'm really excited
about that but again these are just a
little bit cheaper than the Marc Jacobs
ones so they glide on so easily onto the
waterline and they stay and they stay so
I really do recommend these ones from
Urban Decay I would also like to
recommend the Shiseido facial Cotton's I
am officially that youtuber that
recommends these in recommendations
videos yes so it's like $10 a for the
big guy and I purchased mine during the
last vib sale I'm fairly sure it was and
I haven't even gotten halfway through it
and I used those almost every single
night there are so many facial Cotton's
in there that it's like it's crazy to me
but I love them because they don't they
don't like disintegrate on your face you
don't get cotton fibers and your lashes
and they're just they're just my
favorite I know people say $10 is
overpriced for cotton but seriously you
get so many in there it's crazy I don't
even need to repurchase it I thought
like oh should i repurchase it during
the sale and I went and looked at my
pack in the bathroom and I'm like no I
can wait till the next sale totally
gonna be fine
highly recommend and then I want to
recommend a brush also this is the
Sephora collection at 57 brush
it is the airbrush concealer I think I
might actually pick another one up
during the sale as well because I have
seriously had this for years use it
almost every single day which means it
gets washed a ton and it looks it looks
the same as when I bought it all those
years ago it's just my favorite brush
for concealer it's small it gets right
up in there this is just one of my
favorite brushes I recommend it a ton
but Sephora brushes are pricey this one
is $24 so again having a sale helps and
I feel like I should pick another one up
like I feel like I it's time to say
goodbye to that one because I've had it
for so long let me recommend it some
skincare and then hair products real
quick and then I'll move on to my wish
list
Lula Hendrickson has quickly become one
of my favorite skincare brands I
purchased a trio from them I believe
again in the last VIP sale or around
Christmas time and just like fell in
love the brand ivory purchased an item
from that set and I've gone on and
bought a lot more from the brand also
this one the one that I repurchase is
the poor balance of facial sauna scrub I
have the mini of this and I went out and
bought the full size which is $28 I love
this stuff especially in the shower
it applies really hot like really warm
on the skin and then by the time you let
it sit and you take it off it's actually
cooling oh man I just really enjoyed
this I have dry skin right now and I
also have sensitive skin and this one I
feel like like I had to go out and buy
the full size of it I also really
enjoyed this is there uncover the truth
three-in-one melting cleanser I talked
about how I really enjoy taking my
makeup off with an oil or a cleansing
balm and that is exactly what this is
and this works so well it also smells
really good so you can see I've been
making some progress on this cleanser
right here but it just takes everything
off it smells good it's nice and gentle
on the skin this guy is $32 also the
truth serum the full-size I think is $72
is that the full size or the big guy it
might be the big guy that's $72 but it's
expensive if you can get the little mini
I suggest getting a little mini cuz I've
had this for a while I even took it on
my Arizona vacation and I still am not
even halfway down there so I love minis
especially when it comes to skincare
really anything because it's easier to
use minis above but the truth serum is
really nice as well you can either use
it in the more
I also like to use it overnight I feel
like my skin looks really nice and just
like hydrated and dare I say youthful in
the morning but this one is really good
did not grab this but there is a product
from Lancome it is their eye makeup
remover that I absolutely love they
actually have a duo that I'm considering
buying myself it's called the bi-facil
sure I'm saying it wrong instant makeup
remover duo so you get the eye my eye
makeup remover and then the face makeup
remover the eye makeup remover is one of
the best eye makeup removers I have ever
used hands down it always sits by my
sink because if I use either a balm and
oil a makeup remover wipe whatever it is
that I used to remove my makeup and I
don't think it gets off all my eye
makeup or if I remove my makeup before
the shower but I didn't do a good enough
job and I get out and I'm like streaked
with black and like raccoon eyes and
everything I will just grab I should say
the official cotton and I will put some
of this product on here from Lancome and
I just boom it takes everything off I
don't have to rub up my eyes it's
freaking amazing I don't know why I
don't hear more people talk about it
because once I started trying it I was
like what is this miracle nosov this eye
makeup remover so you can get the set
which I believe it's gonna be - like
mini sizes for $20 or the regular full
size for the eye makeup remover is 30 so
if the eye makeup remover is that good
I'm seriously considering getting the
duo and trying out the face product as
well but I'm almost out of the eye
makeup remover so I'm doing that thing
we're like I try not to use it a lot cuz
I don't want to run out of it because
it's like if you're having an emergency
and you really need to get all this eye
makeup off just go with the Lancome it's
gonna take it all off it's amazing drunk
elephant let me recommend just a few
products just just my two favorites two
favorites then I'm gonna recommend from
drunk elephant this is a very pricey a
luxury skincare brand but if you did
want to try them out you need to
repurchase any items doing it during a
sale is the best time to do it like I
feel like that would be the only time
that I would purchase something from
drunk elephant because even though I do
like a lot of their skincare products
and I would recommend them for me
personally I still would want to
repurchase with a discount because it's
expensive but the TLC is Sakaki baby
facial is seriously one of my favorite
products I use this religiously every
single Monday
the son of Monday and your girls excited
because that means I get to use this bad
boy tonight this retails for $80 soles
very expensive but it will last you a
long time especially because I mean it
is powerful it works when you put it on
you're gonna feel tingling
they really suggest it for once a week
maybe twice a week I believe is what it
is because I do have sensitive skin I'm
firm on sticking with that once a week
because again I can feel it working on
my skin so I keep it very strictly at
once a week on a Monday it's like my
luxury at-home facial that I give myself
but I do enjoy it and then I follow it
up with the Virgin marula luxury of
facial oil now this retails for $72
again which is very pricey but I believe
with every purchase of a full-size of
this you actually get a mini of this so
I would recommend doing that and trying
out the oil and seeing if you like it
before just going and spending the full
the full amount on this full-sized
product I believe that's the same way it
is at Sephora as well so I think that
that's a great deal because these do
pair really nicely together because when
you take this off you can tell that your
skin just got a pretty intense facial I
was gonna say workout so that'd be weird
but a pretty intense facial so to put on
a really nice like thick luxurious oil
it just I mean these pair together so
well I totally understand why they put
the mini in with this facial but again I
really enjoy this and it's gonna get you
a long ways so I don't think the mini is
bad as well but I know that $72 is
really expensive to spend on oil if
you're not an oil person you don't like
to put oil on your skin don't even think
about buying it for $72 but if it's
something that you've reached for and
you have in your skincare routine a lot
it is really good I have to be honest
though three haircare recommendations
and then I'll be done with my
recommendations
the current dry shampoo that I use is
from dry bar this is the detox at dry
shampoo I have a mini and a full-size
the mini is $13 and that's what I
started out with I would suggest gain
the mini seeing if it works for you I've
tried so many different dry shampoos and
I was just getting so tired of having
all these like full-size products that I
only used five times and realized
hate it so I got the mini for 13 and
it's fantastic I have a full-size
already because I'm really almost out of
this but I just think it's a great dry
shampoo it really sucks all the oils up
it just rejuvenates my hair it doesn't
leave any sort of white cast or any
anything at all like some other dry
shampoos can so this one isn't my
current favorite dry shampoo I also want
to talk about this is from a verb it's
the C texture spray for light hold dry
volume and weightless grip this stuff is
really awesome as well it's sixteen
dollars I think all four products are
sixteen dollars which is pretty cool but
you do get a pretty big bottle of this
and if you're someone who has really
thin or fine hair like I do I highly
recommend this I'm even just putting my
hair I just have it kind of like in a
sloppy bun today it was so fine I could
not get it to stay in my ponytail like I
could not get my bun to work so I just
grabbed out a bunch of this just sprayed
it all over my hair's judged it with my
fingers and then I was finally able to
actually pull my hair up so again if you
have fine thin hair this really helps to
just give it a little bit of grit if you
wear extensions I put this in before my
extensions a lot because it just kind of
helps my extensions hold to it instead
of the clip just sliding right out
because of my fine hair but this stuff I
think is fantastic and then one more
item from VirB you're also gonna see
listen to upcoming makeup monthly it's
their sea spray windswept waves and the
light dry texture I like to spray this
on my damp hair when I get out of the
shower this just really emphasizes the
waves in my hair it gives us a little
bit of volume it also smells really good
but it just gives it it just gives it a
little bit more life and I notice like
how I was complaining about my hair
today I did not use this yesterday when
I got out of the shower and I can tell a
difference when I don't it just again it
just helps if you have fine thin hair
it's just gonna help give it a little
something and again this one is sixteen
dollars but also recommend that but
after that that is gonna do it for my
recommendations a portion of this video
and what we're going to hop over to my
wish list alrighty so moving on to my
wish list I don't feel like it's too
crazy but I definitely have some items
on here so again I talked about the
hooda Beauty mob obsessions palette for
$27 if it comes back in stock I'm
probably gonna buy it because I've been
pretty excited for that one so I have a
Kat Von D a studded kiss
lipstick it's one of her new like
regular lipstick formula they used to be
the start at creme and now they're the
studded kiss they're only $19 for a
lipstick which I don't think it's
terrible and I really want to pick up
the shade bow-and-arrow and see how it
compares to the liquid lipsticks that's
one of my favorite shades I also have on
here at the cover FX Foundation which is
$44 I really wish the Sunday Riley
foundation would be out I was really
wanting to try that one over the cover
FX but I might just get the cover FX
just because I really want to try a new
foundation and I want to purchase it
during the vib sale to get a discount so
it's $44 you know I've been seeing some
reviews come out so far they look pretty
positive but I really want to test it
out for myself so I might try that one I
also have on my wish list the Too Faced
natural face palette that they just
released it's $44 I talked about the
collection in a will i buy it video
recently and i said that i was actually
excited for the face palettes on my
friend ashley Clady do a review on it
and she said that she thought it was a
pretty darn good palette as well so I
thought $44 50% off I'm also thinking
about picking up the Laura Mercier
flawless fusion concealer which is $28
I've just started seeing the reviews
come in for this one but I'm a big
concealer fan I wear it every single day
it's just a staple in my skincare
routine and I love finding new ones that
I love and because I enjoy the
foundation so much I've just been really
tempted to purchase the concealer and
give it a try but let me know if you
have tried it out as well
I mentioned the lawless liquid lipstick
for $25 also the hood of meeny miny is
set for 33 and then I've just put on
there one of the anastasi Beverly Hills
new bronzers that just released for $28
honestly you know what I reorganized
this weekend I have a bookshelf that's
like in front of me as I film and I have
a bunch of my makeup stored on it and I
reorganized it this weekend if you
follow me on like Instagram stories or
snapchat you are seeing it and I do not
have a huge bronzer collection I really
don't so once I kind of realized that I
was like you know what I don't even
think I'd feel all guilty adding another
bronzer to my collection and getting it
on sale you know what I don't even think
I would feel that bad but I feel like
the bronzers are getting a lot of really
good reviews as well so I'm definitely
thinking about that one and that's all I
have on my list actually right now for
makeup products but I will also say that
I haven't watched a ton of
recommendation videos yet so
see what happens after I start really
binging on them because things could get
a little bit crazy but I don't think
that's too bad and I'm definitely not
gonna buy everything on the list for
makeup but there's quite a few items
that I'm really thinking I'm not gonna
pass up I do have some skincare on there
as well that Willa Hendrickson the
bright eye a banana cream for $38 it is
sold out as of right now I really hope
it comes back I love I creams I'm a big
fan of them and I've been hearing really
good things about this one also from
Allah Hendrickson I just I love their
skincare what can I say this is their C
rush brightening gel cream for $44 I'm
pretty sure I talked about this one in a
will about video and I've just always
had it on my wish list since then and
also on here I've had this one on my
wish list for a while too this is the
fresh rose deep hydration a facial toner
for $44 I feel like I see a lot of
people using this toner and recommending
it and I'm interested in it it says it's
good for dryness pores dullness and
uneven texture let me know if you've
tried this one let me know if you'd
recommend it but I'm really thinking
about getting it and then I just have
one hair care product for me on there
like I said I 20:18 like one of my goals
of 2018 oh wait I forgot I forgot to
recommend one product no how could this
happen okay looking at my phone the Vita
Liberata body blur instant HD skin
finish for $45 I highly recommend I'll
put it in my list for my recommendations
I love this stuff especially come
summertime it kind of like smoothes out
the legs and helps kind of hide any
imperfections on there it gives you a
little bit of a shimmer as well I go
through this stuff like crazy in the
summertime it's currently out of stock
which is not good I hope it comes back
in stock but I would highly recommend
that one oh I was just scrolling through
my list trying to find this hair product
and I realized I didn't talk about that
and that would be a shame if I did not
recommend that to you guys but the hair
product that I have on my list Oh like I
was saying I'm all over the place
2018 I was really gonna try to work on
my hair I've never been good at styling
my hair or just knowing what products to
put in my hair but I found this
recommendation from Jessica Braun or Jam
Beauty 89 she's been raving about the
living proof curl enhancing styling
mousse so like I said that I can
sometimes make my hair curly what I do
is I skip conditioner and then I put
them
in my hair I get a lot of volume I get a
lot of curls with it and I really like
if you ever see me with like big lion
mane hair that's what I have done but
I'm almost out of my mousse and I've
never found a mousse that I am really
loyal to I just haven't
so she's been raving about that one it's
$28 so I think I'm gonna get it Jessica
sounds good I'm gonna go ahead and give
it a try I like how her hair looks when
it's curly so that one's definitely
gonna make it into my cart after that
though that is everything on my wish
list I of course will be doing a haul
video I have been on a pretty firm low
buy it for about four months here after
my husband lost his job he's working
again I worked my ass off these past
four months you guys Wow put my all into
not only my work here on YouTube but my
work as a freelance proofreader an
editor I took on so many projects I
really worked extremely hard during
these these past few months here and you
know what I feel like I deserve to have
a little haul so my haul video will be
coming up but that will be it for my
recommendations and wish list for the
upcoming vib sale I guess that's gonna
be everything for my recommendations and
also my little wish list for the Sephora
vib sale everything of course it will be
linked down below everything that I
mentioned and also do not forget to use
Ebates when you are shopping online so
you can get your cash back that's one of
my favorite things with the vib sale is
seeing how much money I actually get
back because I just include it as like
another discount which is awesome so
don't forget to use Ebates also have a
link down below in case you are not yet
signed up but it's really easy to just
get some a free money back but other
than that that's gonna do it for today's
video let me know what you're planning
on getting in the sale let me know if
any my recommendations are gonna make it
into your cart but as always if you guys
did enjoy this one I hope that you'll
give it a thumbs up I hope that she'll
