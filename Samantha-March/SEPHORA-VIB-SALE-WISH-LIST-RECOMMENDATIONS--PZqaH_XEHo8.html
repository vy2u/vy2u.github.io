today's video is going to tell about the
upcoming of Sephora vib sale I'm going
to be taking you through my wishlist and
also my recommendations for the upcoming
sale so we have a lot to talk about
today so I'm gonna go ahead and get
started if you are not familiar with the
Sephora vib sale it happens twice a year
typically in April and November and
basically you get a certain percentage
off for a specific amount of days now
Sephora has the rewards program which
out how this have just you joined
because it is free and then it has
different tiers inside you start out as
a Beauty Insider once you spend I think
it's three hundred and fifty dollars in
the calendar year you go to vib and then
once you spend a thousand dollars in a
counter year you get to be the VIP Rouge
I won't tell you which one I have you
guys get it yes for yourself and then
typically what we see during the VIP
sales is that Rouge gets to shop first
and they typically get the highest
discount and then it goes to the VIP
members sometimes they get the same
percentage off sometimes it's a little
bit smaller than the Rouge but they shop
next and then the next amount of days is
for the beauty insiders and they to do
typically get a lesser percentage off
now we don't have the full information
yet but I've been getting asked so many
questions about making this video
especially last night after trend mood
did post some information I thought I
would just go ahead and get the video
filmed but I will have any other dates
percentages any information like that
that will also be in the description box
down below
but what trend mood posted I'll have her
Instagram link down below as well is
that Rouge the first access starts
November 3rd through six so that's very
very soon and they get 20% off in stores
and online using the code 24 Rouge but
then it says that there's a holiday
bonus Rouge first access event in
November 10th through 15 another 20% off
in stores and online and again with the
code 24 Rouge this is very curious to me
I don't know if I've ever seen anything
like this to events like this
back-to-back but if you are a Rouge
member which again not saying if I am or
not
then you apparently get to have two
deals all within the same month that's
crazy
and there isn't information yet that I
have seen or vib Rouge and the beauty
insider again I will have that
information down below but I know a lot
of people wanted to see this video so I
trying to put it out as quickly as I can
I'm gonna take you first through my
recommendations what I wouldn't
recommend it that you pick up from the
sale and then I will switch over to my
wishlist and share what I am eyeing and
what is already in my loves list during
the sale so I'm not gonna go in any
particular order here I was making my
list this morning and I was just writing
things down as they were in my love's
list or as I thought them as I was
looking through my collection so really
no like a rhyme or a reason for how I'm
going to be suggesting these but one of
the first items that I put on my list is
from a Kevin at Quan and is the
sculpting powder I talked about the
Kevin of Quan products a lot on my
channel I love a lot of them but in
particular I love the sculpting powder
you can buy the sculpting powder as a
single for $44 or there's also a lot of
different sets that you can buy that
actually might be a better value
considering what it is that you need for
your collection the contour book has the
sculpting powder it has some cream
powders and their highlights and it also
does have a shadow shades and that is
$65 or there's also the making faces at
Beauty book which has three separate
books all inside this one big book you
get an eyeshadow palette in there you
get blushes in there the sculpting
powder bronzer highlights and all of
that is $75 there's also a little duo in
there it's called the contour on the go
it's $25 that was on my loveless from
the Alaska VIP sale and it actually did
sell out right away
but that could be another thing to think
about Kevyn Aucoin is definitely more of
an expensive brand higher prices so I
definitely suggest you know going after
something like this when you are getting
a some sort of percentage off depending
on your tier but getting a percentage
off I think is really helpful and then
also from Marc Jacobs I want to
recommend the highliners the oh my gosh
these eyeliners okay I feel like these
eyeliners kind of took over when they
first came out but they are really good
I have three or four different eyeliners
and I've been wanting to pick another
one up it's $25 for one eyeliner which
is pretty pricey but they are awesome i
glide on very easily they're super
smooth you know especially on the
waterline you don't want anything like
pulling our tugging and they're very
very long lasting but $25 is definitely
expensive for one eyeliner so getting it
out of discount is a great idea
I've been trying out more from Marc
Jacobs Beauty lately and I've just been
so
pres with so many products I'm trying
but to at different lip products I think
I actually purchased these both during a
PID sale but one is the liquid lip creme
which is $28 so pretty pricy it's not
quite a liquid lipstick but it has you
know better lasting power than a regular
liquid lipstick but it's still pretty
comfortable on the lips and also the lip
creme lipsticks which are $30 apiece
these are more of a regular lipstick but
the formula on these are just they're
just so good and definitely worth the
higher price tag but like I said I
bought these during the vib events to be
able to get a percentage off because
it's super super pricey for a lipstick
so if you watched my video on Friday I
did a full face trying out some of your
favorite makeup some of my subscribers
favorite makeup products and I have a
couple items in here that I would
recommend in the VIP sale this first one
is from a makeup forever I tried out a
contour and also a blush and I actually
have the contour and blush on my cheeks
today but I have been eyeing this from
Make Up For Ever for a while and ended
up purchasing for that video but they
have these customized your artist based
color palettes you can buy singles of a
contour blush highlight shade you can
buy duo's or you can buy trios and they
also have the pants to go along with
them but for example if you filled a two
pan palette you bought two singles and
you can buy two contour shades two
blushes two highlights mix-and-match
whatever if you were to buy it with the
pan it would be $35 which it would be 48
if you bought all buff separately and
then for the three pan palette if you
buy the three singles and the pan its
$45 which is originally a $71 value I
think that's awesome and I used a
contour shade and also a blush shade in
that video and I've been very impressed
with all of them actually considering
doing another duo or even a trio because
I was so happy with the two that I
originally purchased so I'm considering
it because I think it's a good deal
anyways and then on top of that getting
a discount
I would suggest check them out you know
we always hear you know kind of being a
little frustrated when it comes to
buying face palettes because there's
always that shade in there that doesn't
quite work for your skin tone and I
really enjoyed this one from makeup
forever because you get to mix and match
and pick your own and customize your own
palette so I would look out for those
foundation that I would recommend if you
like a full coverage foundation is the
laura mercier flawless fusion ultra long
wear foundation it's $48 for a full size
I actually got a sample a couple months
back when I place of Sephora order they
were having free deluxe sized samples so
I selected one I wanted to try it
because I've been hearing good things
about it but I'm not a huge full
coverage fan myself sometimes it's just
a little too much for me but I was
trying to be open-minded I wasn't
hearing good reviews and I tried it out
and it's a really good foundation this
is another one I'm actually considering
getting the full size during the sale
because my sample is almost gone and I
still really enjoy that foundation so
I'm I get because $48 know that's pricey
for a foundation get it with a discount
could be good Laura Mercier foundation
or if you don't like as full coverage
but used to like a good like medium you
can build it up to medium the
full-coverage foundation that I would
recommend for the sale is from Lancome
it's the 10th Idole ultra long wear
foundation this one is $47 again the
coverage isn't quite as full as the
Laura Mercier so if you're someone like
me who prefers more of the medium
coverage foundation I would check out
the Lancome one this has become one of
my favorite foundations I have multiple
shades in it because I just love this
foundation I wear it so often I think it
looks so good on the skin and is also
very long-lasting it's same as the Laura
Mercier so $48 for the Laura Mercier
forty seven dollars for the Lancome if
you're looking for a new good high-end
at foundation I would check those two
out they threw us some more
recommendations I recently tried out the
blinking beaut false eyelashes blinking
view is a new brand into Sephora and
I've been eyeing this brand for quite a
while so when I saw they came into
Sephora I was pretty excited about that
I picked them up when a Sephora was
having a double cashback and I'm pretty
sure I had a gift card too because they
aren't $25 for one pair of lashes I
picked up the style in cokehead I've
been wearing them a lot recently and I
really do like them I kind of want to
get a backup pair of the Coquette lashes
and then maybe try another style I'm not
sure which one's balm best I think is
how you say it I think that's the other
style that I have been eye but $25 is
definitely a lot of money for a pair of
so I'm gonna be excited to try another
pair with the 20% off did I just give
myself away as Rouge another said that I
would recommend this is a holiday set
that has come out and definitely I would
say look at the sets look at the holiday
sets because this is the time of year
that a lot of them are coming out so
then if you can get them as a discount
I feel like sets are usually a discount
anyways and then to get another discount
that's even better but the Stila the
glitter eyeshadows that they have out I
put him in a recent favorites video and
I was like yep they got me I didn't
think I would really enjoy them all that
much but I absolutely fell in love with
them but they have a lot of really cool
sets out they have one that has three
mini glitters for $25 which is awesome
because one full size is $24 and that's
a lot of glitter I mean you're gonna
have to wear glitter basically all over
your body every single day for months on
end to be able to go through one and I
don't really know who all does that so
there's that but they also have ones
that have I think this one has six minis
and that one's $45 or you know if you
just do want to pick up one which is $24
at least you could be getting it for a
discount you know that's still a good
thing and then a highlighter that I want
to recommend this is another one that I
used in my trying out subscribers
favorite makeup this highlight was the
most like unanimously voted on highlight
for me to put in that video and it's
called sin from Urban Decay it's what I
have on my face again today because I
haven't stopped wearing it since I tried
it out in that video and I was like huh
oh my goodness it's $26 for one
highlighter so when I saw that everybody
was recommending it for that video I was
like guys he want me to spend twenty six
dollars on one highlighter and now I'm
like thanks guys cuz I love this
highlight so $26 that's definitely
pretty pricy for a highlight so I wanted
to mention it because I think getting it
for a discount would be awesome but this
is a pretty bangin highlight I'm not
pretty obsessed with it so a few
different palettes that I would
recommend checking out to during the vib
sale one definitely would be from a huda
beauty a lot of people have been really
raving about her second you know larger
eyeshadow palette which is the desert
dust eyeshadow palette it's $65 so it's
definitely pretty pricey for an
eyeshadow palette the first one I didn't
hear great reviews on but the second one
I'm hearing really good things on
I still haven't done it myself I don't
think I'm gonna buy it during the vib
sale I really don't do I know that a lot
of people were getting pretty excited
for it so I would say if that was on
your list and you've been wanting to
check it out you know why don't you go
ahead and purchase it for a discount
that's probably a better time because
$65 is definitely pretty pricey another
very pricey palette is from a Kat Von D
it's the saint and sinner I showed
appellant it's a 62 dollar I shadow
palettes I did get that one sent to me
from my friend live from live loves her
makeup I used it in a trying out a new
holiday video that I did a couple weeks
ago I'll post that down below and also
let's channel I was so grateful to get
that palette because I had said I wasn't
going to buy it I just wasn't super
interested in it I thought maybe the
colors the color scheme inside kind of
throw me off I've been testing it out
because I'm doing a full review video on
it very soon and let me tell you that my
review is gonna be a good one I've been
very happy with this palette very happy
with the shades inside I like the looks
that I've been coming up with so I'm
super grateful for Lib for sending that
to me because otherwise I totally would
have passed on it but it is a $62
eyeshadow palette so to get it for a
discount I do not think it's going to be
a bad thing at all if you like the can't
run the eyeshadows and if this one was
catching your attention I know the
packaging is definitely super unique and
then a face palette that I wanted to
recommend is the Becca a / a ski glow
face palette $54 again that's very
pricey for a pellet but I just bought
this one recently for myself from Ulta
actually when they were having a 20% off
coupon on prestige brands I went ahead
and purchased this one I had it in a
will i buy it video and I said I wanted
to get it I also used it and they trying
out a new holiday makeup so if you want
to see that one in action like I said
that video will be linked down below but
I've been super super happy with this
palette I like the packaging I like the
mirror but I love all the shades inside
as well rose quartz has become one of my
new favorite highlights I think it's
absolutely beautiful
3/4 dollars is definitely very expensive
for a face palette with the six shades
inside but you know during the vib sale
this is when we don't feel as bad when
we splurged on those items that we've
been eyeing I have one more product in
particular that I would recommend and
it's because I saw that they actually
came out with some of the minis of these
which i think is pretty cool these are
from far Sally they kind of took over
Instagram you know like a last year a
couple months back the rose gold elixir
and also the unicorn essence and the
ones that you like you see people like
dropping all over their face I mean I've
been on Instagram dropping it like it's
hot all over my face I have the rose
gold elixir and I love it I'm actually
getting down on my bottle which shocks
me I like to use it under full coverage
foundations especially like the Laura
Mercier the hourglass advantage stick
foundation those are very full coverage
and I like to have that extra boost of
moisture that oil under those
foundations because I think it pairs a
lot better with my skin so I actually
reached remind quite a bit but they are
pretty pricey for a full size it's $54
so I think that's quite a bit for a full
size but again if you're getting a
discount you know that might be more
friendly for your wallet and your bank
account but they also just release some
mini sizes and these are only $20 so
this could be a way for you to try it
out and see if it's worth the hype in
your opinion if it works for your skin
tone you know get the mini size and see
if it works for you and get it at a
discount or you could just go ahead and
purchase the full size at the discount
too so those are some of the specific
items that I wanted to recommend in the
vib sale but I definitely suggest don't
forget about the weekly vows that's a
four it has I think that they'll be
going on during the vib sale as well
every Thursday they drop new items in
their weekly Wow section that are
heavily discounted don't forget to look
at the sets just type in the search bar
sephora favorites they have a ton of
different sets in there and different
kits and those are typically a very good
value as well so don't forget about
those don't forget a bunch of three free
samples if you're into that but that is
all for my recommendations so let's hop
over and I'll share with you what's on
my personal wish list for this VIP sale
you know I got some eyeshadow palettes
on my wish list specifically from a
visor and then also Natasha de Nonna
fazer recently released the golden hour
a shadow palette is $49 it looks really
beautiful for nine shades but also some
of their older pellets that have been on
my wishlist for so long and I haven't
been able to do it because they're $80
$80 but they always looked so good so
those have definitely caught my
attention and then also Natasha - Nonna
she just relates to holiday eyeshadow
palettes those are $48 for five shades
or of course her larger eyeshadow
palettes that cost 129 dollars
Sephora website I don't know guys I
don't know if this is gonna be the vib
sale that I do it because I probably
mentioned these two brands in past VIP
wishlist videos and I haven't been able
to pull the trigger but maybe this time
it'll be it but definitely advise arts
and Natasha Genoa I'm looking at you a
couple items from hood a beauty that I
have on my personal wish list I do still
want to try the faux filter foundation
it's $40 for the foundation I've been
watching the review videos pretty
closely a lot of people are saying it is
very full coverage and very matte so I'm
kind of nervous I don't know if I would
love it but for some reason I'm still
drawn to it I mentioned it in a will i
buy it video and said that I did want to
pick it up and I've almost placed my
order a couple times but I've been kind
of waiting and kind of waiting because I
knew the VIP sale was coming up and I'm
just like oh maybe I should just wait
$40 is kind of pricey so if I could get
a discount especially if it's not
something that I'm like know for sure is
for me I don't know I might do it I
might do it I've even like I've picked
out my shade and everything I've shade
match myself watching other people's
videos and swatches and stuff so I think
I might try to do that one I did just do
a foundation to clutter and I got rid of
quite a few foundations so I wouldn't
feel as that getting a foundation but
also I really enjoy the Hooda liquid
lipsticks and she has some really
awesome sets and I just saw that fine
I've been waiting for this set to come
we knew it was going to come some time
and it's finally here so it is called
the nude love Edition and it has the
shades crush girlfriend wifey and sugar
mama so they're minis up the liquid
lipsticks and it's $33 for the four
shades they also have like a red edition
pink edition and then the brown Edition
and I've actually purchased some of
these as sets before as well the kind
that came with a mini and then also a
lip liner and I just really enjoyed the
hooda lipsticks I have full sizes as
well but I've been waiting for these
nude shades just waiting for them
because I've seen the swatches of them
I've seen them on people and I love
these nudes I think they're just like
speak to me so to get the four minis for
$33 like this I almost I almost bought
it the other day when I was like no wait
for the sale just wait for the sale
Samantha too soon so yeah those are
definitely going in my cart so another
lip
thank to that I almost have ordered for
myself so many times I think I'm gonna
do it during the sale though is from a
senti beauty and it's the gloss balm
universal lip Luminizer the lip gloss
from Venky Beauty I've been hearing such
good things about this lip gloss I did
try out the foundation from Fendi beauty
which unfortunately didn't work out the
best for me and so far I haven't really
been drawn to a lot of items but of
course I've been watching the reviews
and a lot of people are saying really
good things about the gloss so I think
I'm gonna do it I'm not a big gloss
person I feel like in every single video
where I say that I'm wearing lip gloss I
swear to every single video I am wearing
the loss today but I know that lip gloss
is like making the comeback and it's
supposed to be the big trend coming up
here so I think I think I'm going to do
it who has the Fendi lip gloss would you
recommend it it's $18 which I don't
think it's terrible and then you know of
course with the 20% discount on top of
it I don't think that would be bad so I
think I'm gonna go ahead and get the
Fendi lip gloss I found this set from
belief I actually tweeted about the
other day and then I was like really
curious about this set for myself it's
the Holly Jolly hydration set it's going
to be a $38 and it has in there the true
cream moisturizing balm also the
Hungarian water essence and the
moisturizing eye balm I've been trying a
sample size of the eye balm recently and
I've been like all about it really been
enjoying it so when I saw this I was
like hmm and it has the Hungarian water
essence which I've tried at least two
different samples of and I really
enjoyed that I should just buy the full
size but I haven't so I think I kind of
want to get this one I buzzed I was kind
of looking at different skincare to get
live also sent me at the touch of best
sellers kit because if she hadn't I
might have actually put it on my VIP
list I talked myself out of it but I
still kept it on my loves list and I was
like should I do it shouldn't like that
she sent that one to me too which was so
so kind of so I've been trying that one
out so I was looking for other skincare
items if I'd be interested in them and I
think this one the holly-jolly hydration
said am I on that one violet Voss is a
new brand into Sephora so I've been
checking out of the eyeshadow palettes
that they have in there and trying to
decide
I need to pick any of them up the new
eyeshadow palette is their top-notch I
talked about that in the last will i buy
it video they do have the collab that
they did with nicole can see leo who is
a youtuber the holy grail is available
to for $45 i would recommend that one I
love that palette I use it all the time
but the matte about you as an all matte
eyeshadow palette I've been eyeing that
one for $45 they also do have the write
our diet which is like the mega palette
with a lot of different shades in there
475 but I think the one that I would
really be considering is the matte
palette because I really really like the
mattes in my Holy Grail a shadow palette
so I'm trying to decide if I need to get
the matte about you I'm thinking about
it it's on my loves list but that's
another brand you've been wanting to try
out violet boss they now are at Sephora
they have a handful different eyeshadow
palettes in here so you can check those
out but yeah I'm pretty curious about
those as well and then another eyeshadow
palette is from Make Up For Ever I
mentioned this one in either a will I
buy it or a holiday type of will I buy a
video that I was doing but they just
released a new eyeshadow palette as well
for the holiday it reminds me of the
Vice art one so I think I would have to
choose between the two the one from
makeup forever is $49 I feel I think you
get like three more shades than you
would with the advised art one but this
one looks really pretty too and I've
been so impressed with what they make up
forevers face powders that I've been
trying to I'm almost kind of leaning
this route but I'm not sure because I
feel like the shades look pretty similar
I don't think it would make sense to buy
both but they're on my love's list both
right now I just need to make a decision
so let me know what would you guys do
buy their makeup forever then finally I
have another foundation I just added
this one pretty recently to my love's
list so it's at the very top but this
one is from a Dior it's called the Dior
forever perfect foundation it's $50 I've
just been hearing a lot of good reviews
on that keep seeing people use it in
tutorials $50 for her foundation is
pretty pricey so I would have to do it
during some sort of sale or like awesome
coupon so with the 20% off I think that
would help me out a lot but let me know
so I have two foundations on my love's
list I don't know if I need both I'm
kind of on a foundation kick or a
now I don't know if I would need both if
I should get both I don't know what do
you think the hooter the D or has
anybody tried the D or what do you think
but those are my two foundations on my
love's list that I need to try to decide
between but then other than that that's
everything that I have on my love's list
right now I feel like I don't have quite
as intense list that sometimes I do but
I've been actually working pretty hard
on my list the past like couple weeks
here knowing that the sale was coming up
and just trying to be really like what
do I actually need you know what do I
really want in my collection what are
the items that I've been wanting to try
out but I've been waiting for the sale
so I feel like I have a pretty good list
I'm you know I'm of course I'm not gonna
get everything on there and some things
are like if I get this I don't need that
sort of thing but I'm excited to see
what I do end up picking up I of course
will be doing a haul video after this
for a vib sale but after that that's
gonna do it for the recommendations and
also my wish list for the upcoming sale
alright guys so that's going to be
everything for this video I know it's
probably a long one but I did want to
fit in at both my recommendations and
also my wish list I hope that you guys
enjoyed the video and I hope that I did
help you out everything that I mentioned
will of course be linked down below let
me know what you are excited for what
