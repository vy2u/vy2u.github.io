today's video is going to be my
September favorites I have a lot to make
up to talk about I have a piece of
clothing to talk about and I also have a
book that I will touch on as well so
kind of a diverse month of favorites
here but why don't I go ahead and jump
into it talk about is a book so if you
guys don't know I am also a book blogger
I run the blog chiclet plus and I do a
lot of book reviews over there so I will
leave that link down below but I'm
constantly reading I'm also an author so
I'm just you know constantly constantly
reading but I read a book of this month
that I really wanted to recommend to you
guys here so the book is called power
your happy and it is by Lisa sugar and
Lisa sugar is the founder of the website
pop sugar so many of you might be
familiar with pop sugar but pop sugar is
a really cool website I mean it talks
about a lot of different things makeup
Beauty fashion celebrities etc and Lisa
sugar is kind of like the woman behind
it all
so she wrote the book power you're happy
and you know it's about finding your
happiness finding your path it's you
know covers how if she started pop sugar
and the environment that she wanted to
create with her website and her business
and I mean it goes into family life how
she balances everything and I just
thought it was super intriguing it was a
really really quick read I wouldn't call
it like self-help or anything like that
but you know almost kind of it was along
those lines she has a lot of really good
questions in there that you can ask
yourself you know if you're not happy in
your job or you want to move up or start
something new she has a lot of really
good questions in there that you can ask
yourself and good advice and I just was
so impressed with it I sent out a tweet
and I said you know I'm only 15% into
this book I'm already taking notes like
I just thought it was super interesting
and I really wanted to recommend it to
you guys here because I thought a lot of
you might be interested in giving them
in a read so I will leave it linked down
below on Amazon I run it on my Kindle
I'm sure it'll be a really good audio
book as well but I was actually like
taking pictures of like her quizzes and
questions along the way I was taking
pictures on my phone so I could come
back to it it's probably a book that I
will agree
at least one more time maybe even two
more times because I just found it very
very motivating so I wanted to share
that with you guys I want to talk about
is a pair of pants this is from tough
love clothing I recently did a clothing
haul and I featured a lot up left in
their top left is a boutique that I was
running to buy my sister-in-law stuff
she has a physical store in Carroll Iowa
and you can also order things online as
well and so I went in there a couple
weeks ago bought a bunch of clothes I
filmed a haul for it but I wanted to
touch on this pair of pants because I
have been so impressed with these pants
so the they are like the olive green I
think they're called like moto leggings
molo leggings something like that and I
am just loving on them so they're not
really like jeans like they kind of look
like jeans when you have them on but
they're not really jeans they're like
stretchy they don't have a button or a
zipper or anything like that they don't
even have like real pockets like there's
like a lining that maybe looks like
pockets that they're not real pockets
they have some zippers on the end here
obviously I love the olive color he
can't tell just my nails I love the
color but I just love how comfortable
they are
I can't stop recommending them to people
we were just out of party last night at
her friend's house and so many people
ask me about my likings and where I got
them and I'm like top loft they're the
best leggings ever they kind of look
like you're wearing jeans so you're not
just wearing leggings you kind of open
it up a notch but they're also really
super super comfortable so I will leave
them link down below there's a ton of
different colors I just picked up the
olive ones because that's like my
favorite color right now super trendy
color as well also I do have a discount
code stuff gave me a coupon code for my
subscribers so if you do order anything
from Topalov you can you know use the
code Samantha and it gets you 15% off
and you do also get free shipping for
orders over $25 I believe it is so I
just thought that was a really good deal
but once again these are just the
leggings that I love they got some like
texture on the legs here as well I just
thought they're really cool and I wanted
to mention them so I cannot stop wearing
them so palette that I have just been
loving on lately I feel like this is
going to come as no surprise but it is
from Tarte cosmetics and styled by her
brush it is there
i shadow and blush palette that Hruska
lab dwith tart floor so this is what it
looks like on the inside and has six
different eyeshadows and then it does
have a blush shade as well I did a first
impression on this I've done a fall
makeup look with this I'm doing a ton of
tutorials on Instagram with this I love
this palette so much I cannot stop using
it I love the eyeshadows they are so so
incredibly pigmented they are all
beautiful I've used all six shades in
here I think they're amazing the blush
color is really really nice and goes on
so well so pigmented I've just been
loving it it comes with a big mirror as
well which is awesome done a few trips
out of town the past couple weeks and
this is just the only thing that I'm
bringing it's just all I need and I just
love it if you haven't got your hands on
this yet I definitely do recommend it
eyeliner junkie I just eyeliner it's
just my thing and I have one that I
really want to talk to you guys about
because I've absolutely been loving it
it's from colour-pop and it's in collab
with kathleenlights and it is the mr.
bang eyeliner and this is what it looks
like and it's just a really nice like
deep rich chocolate brown eyeliner so
that is what it looks like on my hand
I'm just wearing this all the time I
really love brown eyeliners I have quite
a few in my collection but this is the
one that I've been reaching for the most
because it's not like a is a very warm
brown I just think it's beautiful but
colour-pop eyeliners are my favorite for
my waterline because they stay all day
super super pigmented and this one is no
different and I've just been loving it
these are like six dollars I think five
dollars six dollars
super super affordable and the mr. bang
gotta love it
item from a tart that I want to talk
about is the shape tape concealer so I
was just a little bit late to the game
on this just like just like this much
late in the game because I saw that Tara
was coming out with it and I was like
okay that's fine even though I like
concealers and I own quite a few of them
I was like I don't know if I need it and
then everybody was talking about it and
everybody loved it as being mentioned in
so many different favorites videos and
then it was sold out all the time I was
getting so frustrated but I
they saw or it was finally on the Tarte
website I don't usually order from the
brands websites directly I usually do
Sephora and Ulta to get points but I
finally saw my shade was back on the
Tarte website and I'm like you know what
I'm going for it like I have to have
this my shade is in a light medium this
is an amazing concealer it is giving the
hype because it is very well deserved it
has a big Daddy doe foot applicator it's
amazing it is a full coverage concealer
it covers everything and fliends out
easily it stays all day it does not
crease this concealer is worth all of
the hype I am so glad that I didn't make
myself wait too long to get this if it
is available in your shade I say pick it
up I also saw that I believe they're
coming out with more shades they only
launched like maybe five shades or
something like that but I thought that
they were coming out with even more
shades which is amazing has to keep
telling myself not to keep using this
and tutorials because I just want to use
it every day
the last few products this one has been
like in every day staple since I got it
is from Benefit Cosmetics it is the soft
and natural brow kit so benefit known
for their brows they came out with I
think they have three different of these
brow kits I picked up the soft and
natural because this is what I
gravitated towards the most not only is
that what I like with my brows but when
you open it up inside you get three
different products and these were the
products that I were most interested in
getting from benefit anyways
so each kit I don't know I don't know if
each kit comes with it but this kit does
come with some eyebrows stencils to help
with your brows I haven't used them and
I probably won't use them but if you are
in dye bra stencils that comes with it
if that's helpful for you but what I
like it comes with a full-size goof
proof pencil I've tried like a little
sample of the goof proof pencil and
immediately found that with it I'm very
very new to doing my brows I don't
really have one done today I just have
some tinted eyebrow gel in them but the
goof proof really makes doing your brows
so very simple so I was really excited
that it came with the full size of this
it has product on one end and the
spoolie on the other it also does come
with the hybrid
so this is what this one looks like so
it's just to place underneath the brow
to help clean it up
and to highlight the brow bone and this
is a full-size as well and then it also
comes I believe this is the mini size of
the Ready Set brow which is just a clear
brow gel to hold the brows in place and
the total for this is $34 and I think if
you were to purchase everything
separately it's gonna be like $60 or
something like that so there is a really
really good deal and I'm just obsessed
with this and these kits are selling out
very quickly and I know that benefit
keeps making more so even if it is still
about right now they will keep coming
back but these have been so popular like
I'm sure benefit expected that they
would be popular but they are incredibly
incredibly popular the soft and natural
so the one that I have it is exclusive
to Sephora the other ones you can also
get on alte as well but the soft and
natural is only available at Sephora and
that benefit of course and they also
only come in certain shades so like mine
is in a shade too but I think the
benefit selection I think they have like
six different shades and not each kit
comes in every shade so that's something
to make sure that you pay attention to
when you do get it as you know make sure
whatever it is you're buying that your
shades available in it but these are
amazing
I cannot recommend these enough the lip
products to talk about and then we are
done so both of the lippies that I'm
going to talk about did come in my give
me some lip collection that I picked up
from Sephora I did a full video about it
it was one of the Sephora favorites sets
where they have a variety of different
products in there and you can get them
all bundled together I actually had it
on my list to include the give me some
lip collection but it sold out very
quickly and once they sell out they are
sold out so I didn't want to put it in
there because it's not coming back you
can't get it but if you got your hands
on it
Congrats to you because it was a really
amazing kit but these two products were
in there and you can buy them separately
on their own but the first one is the
Lancome juicy shaker it looks like that
and the shape that came in it was
boomerang so I was really curious to try
this because I wasn't quite sure what
the concept was but basically when you
open it up this is what the applicator
looks like and that kind of what you do
is when you open
you shake it up and then you would apply
it to your lips and it's actually a lip
oil and I figured I was like you know I
like lip I have some lip scrubs like
sure I'll probably like this no I love
it
I love it I talked about on Instagram
I've talked about it on my snapchat I am
obsessed with this I can't stop wearing
it it feels so good on the lips it's
very nourishing very moisturizing it
does give you a little bit of color to
like that much but it gives a little bit
of like this pinky tone color it's been
absolutely amazing I'm really glad that
it did come in that kit because I
probably wouldn't have tried it
otherwise because I think this is $24
and for me being like oh you know maybe
I'll like it
I probably wasn't going to spend that
money on it but it's really really good
so if you've been interested in the
juicy shaker's I say go for it product
that I want to talk about is from
Smashbox it's one of their always on
liquid lipsticks and the shade that came
in there I believe this is stepping out
yeah stepping out is the shade this is
what it looks like I have worn this very
frequently as well I've used in a lot of
different tutorials on Instagram because
I love it it's a very like it's a pretty
deep brown like everything in there was
if into give me some blood collection it
was kind of on the nude side but this is
definitely more like brown versus nude
if that makes sense but the actual
formula of these are amazing they stay
on all night like this is right up there
like Kylie cosmetics is one of my
favorite liquid lipstick formulas and
this is now right up there I think
they're amazing I actually was able to
try out another color I think it was
called dream huge maybe it was a pink
shade it's in my social ah unboxing I
got it in there and I tried that on and
at the same thing lasts all night super
super comfortable not drying on the lips
doesn't even feel like you're wearing a
lipstick like I'm so impressed with
these I think these are like 21 or 24
dollars somewhere in the $20 range and
totally totally worth it the applicator
is a little bit different up shake is
what the applicator looks like so a
little bit on the different side and I
don't sometimes it's been a little bit
hard to maneuver around the lines
my lips I've actually just the other day
when I board this I went in with some
concealer around my lip line to kind of
clean it up so table care I wouldn't say
is my absolute favorite but the formula
definitely is this color I love if you
look Browns super pretty the dream huge
is actually a bright pink I thought it'd
be more of a mauve it's more of a bright
pink but I definitely want to get more
of these because I'm so impressed with
this lipstick everything for my
