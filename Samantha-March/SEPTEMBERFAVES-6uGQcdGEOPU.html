guys don't know what that was but
welcome back today's video is going to
be at my September beauty and lifestyle
favorites and I almost didn't do this
one just because I don't actually have a
whole lot of products to mention but
then also I did the fall favorites tag
so I mentioned a few favorites and there
and then my whole october schedule just
kind of got pushed back and rearranged
because i added in the fall favorites
tag which obviously i didn't put on my
schedule until jacqueline hell came out
with a tag video and then i also did the
Jackie Collins video which of course was
an unexpected video as well but
everything else kind of got pushed back
and then I was trying to decide whether
to do this but I do have a few products
to talk about so i thought that i would
so if you would like to see my September
beauty and lifestyle favorites please
keep off first I have a skincare product
to talk about and I can't remember if
I've mentioned this on video if I only
did it on my snapchat hall I don't think
I put it in favorites but I'm going to
talk about it because i'm currently
obsessed with it and this is the
Neutrogena ultralight cleansing oil i
picked this up at target i want to say
it was maybe like seven or eight dollars
it's just a little pump and this is all
oil in here and i said it effortlessly
and completely removes dirt oil and
waterproof makeup and it rinses clean
without stripping I am just truly
obsessed with this I swear I talked
about this on camera but even if I put
it in a favorites video I don't care
because I'm using it and like look how
much is gone like you can't even tell
that I've been using this every night
but I got it because I've been wearing
you know a lot more makeup when I did
like the days that I film for YouTube I
usually have a fairly full face of
makeup on and at night I've just been
feeling like I'm not getting all the
makeup off so i thought i needed to step
up my game and so when I saw those that
target i thought i would pick it up it
feels so good I what I do is I pump it
three times but i do very small pumps I
mean I'd pump it but then it would just
be a big mess but i do like half pumps
so i probably do one full pump but i do
like three just teeny tiny pumps
then you just put the oil at your hands
should be dry and your face should be
dry when you put it on and I put it all
over my face I also bring it down onto
my neck but I literally will just sit
there and like keep rubbing my face
which maybe I shouldn't do but that's
what I do because it feels so good but I
also can tell that it is removing my
makeup because I will always wash my
face at night and then I wash my face in
the morning as well and sometimes even
in the morning when I would take like a
little like cotton and be like rubbing
my face with it I was still getting
makeup off knowing that it wasn't coming
off from the night before and then once
i started using this I don't see any
makeup residue the next morning so
loving this the next product I have to
talk about is an oldie and one that you
know when you get new makeup products
and you're just excited to be using him
like I've been using the cap on d
palette it seems like every single day I
can't stop using it but you start using
new makeup and then you kind of forget
about your old makeup but then I decided
it just randomly a few weeks ago to dip
back into my to face and natural eye
palette and then I was like why did I
stop using this because I love this and
you can see that it has clearly been
very loved you can see a close-up of
that but like yeah I hit pan on push up
honey pot has a huge dip in it silk
teddy has a lot of products taken out of
it like I just love this palette this
packaging is very different because this
is like the old to face packaging their
natural eye palette that they have now I
think it has different shades in it but
it's also just like the packaging is
totally different but I got this like
way back in the day when to face first
came out I actually was like on their
blogger list or something I don't know
but I got a lot of free stuff from Too
Faced they would send it to me to review
which I thought was pretty cool and then
all of a sudden they like blew up and I
was left in the dust so two-faced come
back because I still love you and I buy
all your projects hello but yeah so I've
definitely been doing this one a lot
more like my favorite shades obviously
you should be able to tell are the
push-up and the honeypot I just used
this actually
in a video i just use this in my was it
might get ready with me makeup but i
think i use this but yeah i love it i
also love velvet revolver heaven is a
really good um like I brow highlight I
just I'm so glad that I rediscovered
this one I just I love it I'll have a
pigment to talk about and this is from
Mac these are what their pigments look
like and this is in vanilla so that's
what that looks like and I bought this
vanilla peg pigment I believe it was
from with a carli bybel video she I just
found that she kept using the vanilla of
mac pigment over and over so I was like
okay I'll go see what this is all about
so I went to mac and bought it I don't
know if you guys can see like that's
it's just loose pigment so you do kind
of have to be careful but I can try to
put some on my hand here you guys see
that okay that's what it looks like and
basically what i use this for is I'll
put it in my like inner tear duct in a
recorder of my eye for like a pop of
color right there sometimes I'll use it
as a eyebrow highlight it's just it's so
beautiful and now I can't remember
exactly how much the pigments are but I
can list it up here but seriously I've
had this for probably over a year and
I've used it multiple times I mean it's
not like I've just used it two three
four times I've used it several times
but you only need a little bit and it
goes a long way I mean I'm probably
gonna have this forever I can't imagine
going through a full thing of pigment so
I definitely want to pick up some more
from back another one I have to talk
about this month is a nail polish it's
not the color I'm wearing because you
know that would make two cents but I too
much sense but I honestly I thought
about wearing it was between these two
colors and I just decided I wanted the
brighter pink before like people really
yelled at me that I can't wear bright
colors anymore because it's fall and I'm
like hello I'm what I'm glad today this
is the only thing of plaid I think I own
and I didn't even buy it it got sent to
me by a company so I think I mentioned
this in a video
Oh before to maybe a halt but I got this
at target and this is the sally hansen
miracle gel polish and the color is
totally yours and it's just a very
beautiful like nude brown shade and I
absolutely love it I picked it up a
target Sally Hansen maybe it was like
eight dollars or so but also what really
impresses me about the miracle gel line
I was a little nervous to pick it up
because I was like mmm and it's not
really gonna work is it this nail polish
did not budge I was so impressed with it
it truly was like I had gotten a gel
manicure with the lasting power but I
was also really impressed that it dried
fast I put this on when I was visiting
when my family was up here from Alabama
and I was visiting them and was saturday
morning we were in the hotel room we had
like a full day of like we were meeting
other family members we were going to
lunch like we're doing all these things
and my nails just looked so janky
because I had on a really dark purple
polish before and before I drove up to
dubuque to see them I took the polish
off but you know when you have like dark
nail colors like you can still like kind
of see it like in the corners are like
my nails were like peeling off and you
could still see some oh my gosh it just
it looked so bad so I had thrown this in
my purse before I left to do that drive
and I took it out and in the hotel room
talking to my family we're eating
breakfast I'm over there like painting
my nails like oh my god little gonna
paint my nails so fast not like there's
no way I'm totally gonna screw these up
they dried within minutes I was so
impressed because I also do have the
sally hansen 3d gel shine which I really
like and I really think it does a good
job but it takes a really long time to
dry and your nails are just kind of
always a little moist if you know what
I'm saying so I worried that would be
the same with this but it's not I am
picking up I'm gonna pick up a lot of
colors from this line because i was so
impressed with it have a lip combination
to talk about and this has just been my
favorite lip combo for a while now and
of course i'm not wearing it because
once again that would make too much
sense I'm
today i'm wearing midi from colour-pop
but the two that i have been loving
together is a mac lip liner and then a
Gerard cosmetics lipstick so the mac lip
liner is in world I've talked about this
on my channel before I really need to
sharpen it can someone please send me a
pencil sharpener I don't have one and
every time I go to alter Sephora are the
friggin grocery store I forget to pick
up a pencil sharpener but we're all from
Mac absolutely love the lip liner in
general but then when I pair it with
underground from Gerard cosmetics it's
just like a match made in heaven
underground is like that cool grey shade
oh I love it I love it i'll swap them
both on my hand so this is underground
from drawer cosmetics and then next to
it is a world from mac i love this
combination i wore it in my empties
video which i will leave in the card up
here warden my empties video got so many
comments and feedback on it put it on
Instagram a lot of people are asking me
what I was wearing it is macworld
android cosmetics underground if you
ever see me with some sort of a grey lip
it is probably underground from droid
cosmetics i am like obsessed with this
lipstick love it i have to kind of like
random things to talk about and the
first one is a purse and it's like a
cross body purse this is what it looks
like that's what it looks like this is
from forever 21 and the reason why I got
it is back in August we took a chicago
trip for the whole weekend me and seven
of my friends including my husband went
to chicago we went to a Chicago Cubs
baseball game we went to a slipknot
concert at tinley park it was so much
fun but before we left on our trip I was
like I really need to borrow a crossbody
from somebody because my purse is a
giant it's it's right next to me I'll
show it hearse is this giant of michael
kors first and i don't want to be
carrying that around the whole time my
purse is so drying it literally knocked
my camera right off the stand that's how
giant thought michael kors Bertha's it
carries everything but I didn't want to
be carrying it like into the baseball
game especially with like house
jerk the rules are and what you can and
cannot bring in I really didn't want to
bring it to the concert and just be like
having to deal with it the whole time
and forgot to borrow a crossbody as we
were in Chicago the first day we went on
the magnificent mile and I was trying to
find one I didn't want to spend a lot of
money because I was like I'm probably
never gonna wear a cross body again it's
just not me it's not what I where I
don't really want one I just know that
it's practical why do I not borrow one
like I was just berating myself all I
could seem to find was like the coach
purses and the michael kors and they
were like 150 dollar so this little tiny
thing and I'm like no then we went to
forever 21 and I've had this $21 I was
like yes but I've been using it a lot
more than I thought I would like I've
been taking it nice that we just go out
you know say a bart we had a girls night
a few weeks ago we're just a bunch of
the girls went out and I have this it's
so much easier than carrying my big
purse I'm so impressed with it and it
fits a lot I think I'm yeah I always
have like a travel perfume in all of my
clutches because you never know but like
it's really big on the inside obviously
it fits money my ID I mean my makeup
brushes any lipsticks that I want and it
has this little pocket up here that this
is usually where i keep my ID and money
because I put so much makeup in here
that it's like hard to get out you're
trying to get ID'd you know my goon I
can't find it and then it even has this
little compartment back here I just I
love it I'm very impressed with it
forever 21 if you're looking for a
crossbody and you don't want to spend a
lot of money really like it and I love
the gray color obviously this is the
same color as my regular purse I really
enjoy gray okay the last thing that I
have to talk about I guess maybe I had a
little bit more than then I thought I
was going to but the last thing I have
to talk about is another random but I'm
so grateful for this and I literally
have had this for like maybe three days
and I'm completely obsessed with this so
I mean I guess maybe I am cheating cuz i
got this in October I'm cheating I'm
sorry I'm admitting it I'm cheating but
totally obsessed with it right now and
it is a sin see now it's plugged in
and it's working so i didn't want to
grab it but I grabbed like the three
senses that I got sent as well and what
happened if you guys watched my I think
it was my fault favorites tag there was
a point where like the UPS man came and
he was going to give me a package and
then he wouldn't give it to me and it
was right in the middle of filming so I
was like explaining what was going on
well I finally got the package and it
was a sin see and i'm so glad i got it
and he gave me the package that was
seriously still the weirdest thing ever
but what happened was an author that I
know I did some marketing work for her a
little while ago a few months ago or
something and she's a sense a consultant
and as like a thank-you gift she sent me
a sin see how cool is that I was totally
blown away I just think that's amazing
so not only did she send me like the
scentsy warmer which is really cute it
has like cut um pencils all over it
which I just think is so cute especially
for my author world but she also sent me
these three cents I was like who does
that that's the nicest thing so her name
is Isabella Louise Anderson she's the
author of the right design which I have
read and reviewed and of course I loved
it loved Isabella i will leave the link
to her book below and his on amazon i
hope you'll check it out because it's
really great women's fiction but i was
just totally blown away by how nice this
was I just thought that was the coolest
thing what I have burning now is the
coconut pumpkin pie scent and I have two
of the little guys in the pot but then
she also sent me guava honey oh that
sounds like it would be good and also
toffee butter crunch like how cool is
that like I just think that's amazing
but honestly I knew what sensei's were
I'd heard of them and I just I guess I
never really thought that they would
work and I also mentioned this in my
fault favorites tight that i'm not a big
candle person like i've just never
really big a been a big candle person
and i think it's because to me and at
least the candles that I've been buying
I don't really seem to smell like you
light a candle and for the first 10
minutes really oh yeah that smells good
and then it's like oh it looked a
candlelight hmm I don't smell anything I
mean even I mentioned the fall wreath
candle in the fall favorites video I
don't smell that
all to the point where I can't remember
the last time we burned it because I'm
like what's the point it doesn't make my
house smell like fall anymore I plugged
in the sun sea and I put the two bars in
it it immediately melted the wax and it
lit up like our entire house my husband
said he could smell it when he was
halfway up the stairs from the basement
he was coming upstairs he's like I could
already smell it even when like I turn
it off when we sleep or like if I leave
I I don't have it on I will come home
and I can still smell it it's amazing it
totally works I can't believe it I don't
belong away I will also leave Isabella's
links to her son see I know she has like
a sense a page or something but if you
guys want to check it out or if you've
never checked out cincy or you need to
reorder anything I definitely suggest
Isabella because like that was like the
kindest thing ever and no I just know
I'm going to be obsessed with sensi okay

thought it was going to but yeah those
