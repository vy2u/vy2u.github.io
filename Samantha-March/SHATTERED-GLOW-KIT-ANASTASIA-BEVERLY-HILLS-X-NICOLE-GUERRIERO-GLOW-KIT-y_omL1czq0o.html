today's video is a sad one I feel like I
usually suck most of my videos been like
oh I'm so excited for this video but I'm
pretty bummed about this video it's
going to be about the new Anasazi of
Beverly Hills and Nicole Guerrero blow
kit and unfortunately it's it's kind of
a bummer of a video because I got my
palette on Thursday I did the special
release like it released early on the
sephora app exclusively so I purchased
it through there I got it on Thursday I
was so so excited so this is the palette
but when I opened it up oh my goodness
when I opened it up this is what it
looked like if you can tell this pan is
completely shattered it's the one for
three impossible for me to hold up this
palette to show you guys because that
highlight is so broken and it's
everywhere I'm filming with a towel on
my lap because this highlight is getting
everywhere wasn't really sure what to do
you know obviously I got this palette
and I got it early because I wanted to
get a review video up for you guys and
you know show you the swatches and talk
about what I think about it and you know
this is gonna be a good purchase am I
happy that I got it etc and now I'm
having to do a whole different type of
video and I kind of wondered and went
back and forth do I make a video on it
or what do I do
I don't know what to do but I decided to
go ahead and and make the video and just
kind of give you guys my experience my
feedback what's happening to me because
there's a lot of issues around this glow
kid and I'm so I'm I'm very sad if you
guys watch my will I buy up video I just
featured this one in last week's will I
buy it and I was so excited about it and
that was another reason why I wanted to
film this video was to kind of follow up
on that because I don't think you could
take my excitement in that will I buy a
video and then just like never hear
about this palette again that's like
what's what's happening unless you're on
my snapchat you want
really No so I got the palette and when
I opened up the Sephora box there was no
bubble wrap the palette was not bubble
wrapped the only thing that was inside
the Sephora package as like a protection
was this like this sheet of paper and
just this one this was it this is the
only thing that was in the box
besides send like my my packing slipper
or whatever that was all so I see that
and I'm just I immediately knew I just
thought there is no way that Glock it is
intact there's no way if you guys are
new to my channel or you've never been
here then you might not know this story
but this is not my first broken glow kit
this is not my second broken glow kit
this is not my third broken glow kit
this is not my fourth broken glow kit I
mean do I sound like a broken record
this is my fifth shattered glow kit in a
row that I have received so when I saw
the way that this had come packaged I
just knew there's no way that thing's
intact and sure enough a panelist was
shattered I was super excited when the
anastacio sweet school kit was coming
out I was so excited about that one
couldn't wait to get it and I was so
excited it released on the UH Nastasia
website first before it even hit Sephora
and I had never ordered from the
anastasi a website before I normally
purchased from Sephora so I can do like
the points and rewards and whatever but
I was like oh my gosh I'm so excited I
ordered one and I ordered an extra one
for a giveaway that's how pumped I was
and they both came shattered and I was
seeing a lot of other people saying
their sweets came shattered as well I
contacted a Nastasia they sent me two
more glow kits they both came shattered
the contact Anasazi again they told me
they couldn't do anything because the
product was now out of stock so they
just refund at me for both but they did
let me keep all four glow kits
I liked that I didn't have to worry
about shipping anything bag and I'd have
to worry about anything I gave some away
you know I let people know this is this
is broken but if you want to try the
alcohol thing on it you can but I don't
need for glow kits I kept one for myself
I tried the alcohol thing it didn't work
my sweets glow kit looks a hot mess I
barely use it because it looked so bad
so that was a bummer so
so one of the reasons why I'm so upset
is because this is my fifth third Glo
kit fifth like at what point do I throw
the towel in on Glo kits and say we are
just not meant to be together
it's like at one point at what point am
I going to learn my lesson my situation
I open it up I see that it's broken I'm
very upset I start live chatting with
Sephora and they tell me that they can
give me the refund but because the
product is out of stock they can't send
me a new one and they put in there that
I needed to send my glow kid back
and then I also make sure to put a note
in there to say I needed to package it
carefully so it doesn't get damaged
during transit and I'm like like you
packaged it carefully like you threw it
in a box and put a sheet of paper over
it but I need to go out and buy a bubble
wrap to make sure it doesn't break any
more what and I'm like okay so if I send
them back my cloak it and it comes
damaged are they not gonna give me my
money back I'm very confused right now
I'm very confused I'm very upset so I
email I use the email and email them at
the same time I'm calling my local
Sephora explaining what's going on I'm
like do you have any glow kits there I
could come in and exchange it for no
we're not gonna get the glow kits in
until either March 9th or March 13th the
gal don't even know and I'm like but do
you have any there if I just come and do
an exchange do you have any secret
pallets because you know I'm here in
these pallets we're already in the back
rooms like they weren't out yet but if
you asked Sephora they had to give them
to you and so I'm like do you have any
of those I just want I just want a
pallet I just what the heck man and
they're like no we don't have any not
until the 9th of the 13th so I'm like ok
so I get an email back from Sephora and
they tell me you know the product is out
of stock so all they can do is refund me
but I need to ship it back and I'm like
ok so I ordered this early because you
had an early promotion going on Sephora
it comes shipped to me poorly packaged
just putting a sheet of paper on top of
anything no matter what it is I'm
ordering - that'd be the packaging is
really upsetting to me that's
unacceptable to me
no matter what was in that package there
should have been more to that you know
what I'm saying just silly so you guys
packaged it incorrectly and now it's
coming to me broken and now not only do
I have to give up my glow kit I have to
send it back to you the glow kits out of
stock I can't get another one so I have
to go without my Glock it now and I have
to package this thing up and then I have
to drive to my post office to send it
back to you why do I have to go through
all that time and energy and effort for
your mistake and then still I'm without
my glow kit because on Friday it sold
out at like 3 a.m. or something like
that I'm not sure the exact time but
people are saying it was supposed to
launch it like 5:00 a.m. but it went out
early and then it was already sold out
by the time I woke up Friday morning it
had already launched and sold out on the
sephora website boom it's gone and it's
not coming into my stores for another
two weeks so what am I supposed to do
and how is that fair to me as the
customer and then I posted on Instagram
I share a photo of the broken pallet and
I say how upset I am and I say how it
came packaged and all of a sudden these
comments start coming in and people are
saying mine came broken too I mean so
many people have come broken it's crazy
but people start saying I called Sephora
and they gave me a refund but they're
letting me keep the glow kit and I'm
like well how come I have to waste my
time and effort and I have to send it
back and then be without a glove that
doesn't seem fair
how come some people are getting treated
this way and some people are getting
treated another way that's not OK
so I emailed Sephora again on the email
that they sent back to me and I said you
know look and I explained everything
that I just said why do I have to go
through this and why do I have to take
my time and why do I have to give up my
glow kit that now I can't get again and
go to my post office and send something
back to you when other people are in the
same situation and you're letting them
keep their glow kit and give them a
refund that's not fair you can't treat
people differently what's that about at
the current time that I'm filming I'm
still waiting for Sephora to get back to
me so this is
stone unresolved issue I'm not sure
what's gonna happen but that's where we
are right now I can put it in the
description box if something changes but
that's where we are right now and I'm
very sad I'm very upset about this and
I'm also upset because it's my fifth
glow kit that's come broken and I would
have assumed from the sweets palette
debacle because so many sweets glow kids
came broken that the Anastacio
highlights are very soft
you know they clearly don't all make it
in transit that they need to be packaged
better when they're being shipped I
would have assumed that somehow that
would have been let known to Sephora or
any other retailers hey these are prone
to breaking make sure you put it in
bubbler I mean something not just throw
it in a box and throw sheet of paper
over it and you know I don't know maybe
the Anastasio brand said that maybe
that's well known and maybe a Sephora
employee just didn't do that I don't
know what happened I don't know anything
like that but it's just shocking to me
that I'm hearing a lot of people say
that that's how theirs came packaged you
know basically not packaged and that so
many gold kids are coming broken to me
it's just so sad I'm very sad for Nicole
Guerrero because I know she said on her
snapchat she's seeing the tweets and
she's seen that Instagram post about all
of these broken palates it's such a
waste of money it's a waste of people's
time I feel bad for Nicole because you
know her names on it I'm sure she feels
responsible in some way and she wants to
make people happy and now she's having
to deal with this I don't know but
that's what that's what happened to my
glow kit guys we have some breaking news
I was setting my camera cool down and I
just got an email back from Sephora so
reading word for word dear Samantha
thank you for contacting Safaricom
regarding your order we apologize for
any inconvenience this may have caused
do not worry about mailing the glow kit
back you can keep it if we can further
assist you please contact us so okay so
I get to keep the glow kit which is good
news that makes me that makes me happy
because I just I was I was very confused
when I was seeing on Instagram that
people are saying they're getting trade
differently from Sephora and I don't
think that's okay
so what I was actually going to talk
about next in my video is that now I've
been seeing I'm filming this on Friday
and I think this video will go up on
Sunday I'm seeing a lot of people say on
Instagram on snapchat that their palates
are coming broken from Sephora
blar saying there's no packaging some
people are saying there's minimal
packaging some people are getting their
palates just fine I've had plenty of
friends get their palates and they are
perfectly okay good for you no I'm just
kidding no really I would not I would
not wish for someone to get you know
they pay for something and it comes
broken like that's not okay there's
videos coming out of like what's the
scandal who's behind this
etc etc I don't know and you know I
don't I don't like to make negative
videos I feel like you guys can probably
tell that my energy is low because this
sucks man you know I'm bummed I was so
excited and my will I bet video I was so
excited for this glow kit
I was excited too poor to support Nicole
Guerrero and you know I'm just bummed
and then so you know what Sephora was
saying back to me kind of put me in a
worse mood and then seeing that they
were treating other people differently
I'm like wait a second I'm confused and
you know if this is such a widespread
problem that so many people are getting
broken glow kits there would be one
resolution everybody should be getting
the same resolution it shouldn't be
different you know you you contacted
this person as for you talk to this
person at Sephora and they're telling
people different things that's not fair
and you know obviously in the world of
social media we're gonna find out
so that's not fair so what I was going
to say about my glow kit is that only
the one Panda shattered the 143 I'm
seeing some pallets every single shade
of shattered or three shades are
shattered or haven two shades are
shattered which is such a bummer and
what I was thinking about doing was just
basically taking one for three out and
just having a five pan highlight shade
which I mean still I shouldn't have to
pay full price for that because I'm not
getting the full product and then after
all this like run around and all this
crap time that I've had to spend
contacting Sephora to try to make it
right like I don't know I feel like I
should get my money back for that but
out of all of the shades to break I
guess maybe I'm not upset about that one
cuz that
probably in my mind would have been one
that I used the least because it was so
dark I don't know if it would have
looked great especially when I'm paler
like I am now
so I'm like you know out of everything
it was relatively unscathed or whatever
you know this is all such
firstworldproblems I understand I
understand that I know people are gonna
come after me that I'm super dramatic
about makeup but it sucks you know I
paid for it I got on the side early I
used the app early I paid for the fast
shipping so like yeah you know of course
I'm upset about this I wanted to get a
review video up and instead I have to
sit here and tell you guys what happened
and then you complain about it that's
not fun for me this isn't a fun video to
make so I know a lot of you guys are
probably like why don't you just do like
the alcohol trick I'm getting tons of
snaps and on Instagram just do the
alcohol thing just do the alcohol thing
I don't think I have the patience to do
that because when my sweets glow kit
came they all came shattered off our
pants were shattered and so I tried to
do it and this is what my sweets glow
kit looks like I mean that doesn't look
right right like I mean I don't know in
this shade like this the color of this
highlight like changed completely I
don't think I'm doing it right I don't
think I have the patience for it like I
said I like never put this on camera
because like that doesn't even look that
doesn't even look okay that doesn't even
look right so I don't want to do that
again like that has that's time that I
tried to do it with this palette like no
no I'm probably not gonna do that again
I clearly was doing something wrong so I
don't want to mess up this palette so
honestly I'm probably just gonna throw
the pan away and you know have a 5 shake
glow kit that's what I'm thinking at
this time but I I'm bummed but you know
all things considered at least not every
shade is broken at least it's only the
one that I thought I was going to get
the least amount of use out of you know
I'm grateful for all those things and
now I'm glad that I get to keep the
palette because like I said it's sold
out
so I can't get it replaced or it's gonna
take two weeks to replace it and then
what's gonna happen I'm gonna have to
ship it again is it gonna come broken
again or am I gonna have to go to my mom
hate go to the mall hate go all of all
oh like when I think about having to go
to the mall oh I just like cringe and
it's not my friend
so I'd either have to do that
and then who knows how fast they're
going to sell out in the store do I have
to be there right when the store opens
the day they comment like I shouldn't
have to do that you know what I'm saying
I shouldn't have to so I'm really
grateful that Sephora wrote me back and
said that I'm very I'm happy about that
I am happy that I get to keep my glow
kid even though it's gonna be it's gonna
be one band down but that's okay but I
wanted to tell you guys know what
happened and want to try to do the
swatches of the five other highlights in
there so I can show you guys and let you
know what i think i didn't play around
with them a little bit last night
they're really beautiful they're kind of
glittery which i'm not like the biggest
fan of but it's not something that turns
me off too much but I thought I would at
least go through show you some swatches
of the five and then maybe put like two
on my face or something I don't have any
highlight on right now so I thought I
could apply them so you could see what
they're like on my face and like maybe
trying to do a review video I mean not
really but at least try to give you my
feedback on it but that's my experience
with the glow kit and like I said I'm
just really sad I'm frustrated that it's
my fifth glow kit I don't know if I'll
purchase a glow kit in the future I
don't think so I said it on my snapchat
I'm not going to so I need you guys to
hold me accountable but it just they
can't get to me not shattered I don't I
don't know and like I said the other
four that I ordered from anastasi is
website directly so it's not just the
flora they also came from Anastasio
shattered now they're coming from
Sephora shattered like I just don't I
don't feel like I have a lot of trust in
anybody right now I have trust issues
right now you guys are getting broken
ones I urge you to call or email Sephora
and let them know and hopefully what
they would do was refund you and let you
keep the palette and hopefully you have
at least a few shades out of there that
are manageable I don't really recommend
getting these shipped to you I guess I
really I can I'm so sorry if you don't
have you know Sephora in your town but I
don't know I can't say I would recommend
getting these shipped to you because I
don't know how they're gonna come
packaged and you know there's really no
guarantee even if there is bubble wrap
there's no guarantee it's not gonna come
shattered so I don't know guys I'm so
sorry
it looks like such a nice pallet um I'll
go ahead and do the swatches next okay
so here are the first three spot is so
this
is kitty cat forever young and then
daydream daydream was really hard to get
because so much of one four three has
gone into it but give it a try
so there are some siwash is there like
super metallic again that is the first
three and these shades like especially
the first two I think that I'll
definitely get a lot of use of out of so
I'm excited about that but then let's
try the next ones so we have forever
licked and then glow getter so this is
forever lit and then glow getter so that
is a what they look like I really like
forever lid it's such like a cool like
frosty type of blue I think that looks
really neat and then glow Gator is more
gold which it's more of a like a warm
gold - I would say so again like the
last two shades in the palette I wasn't
sure I would get a ton of use out of I
actually thought I could wear them more
as eyeshadows so that's why one for
three being the one that has broken like
it's at least it's not you know some of
the first two that have more like the
pinky shades that I think would be
better for my skin tone and I was really
excited about forever lit the blue one
so you know I can at least be grateful
about that but those are the other two
swatches I obviously can't swatch one
for three because it's completely broken
and there's that so I'm gonna pick up my
Sigma fan brush and just this is kitty
cat and apply it to my cheeks like
highlights are no joke guys they're so
pretty it's like that's I'm just like so
bummed
so that is kitty cat it's gorgeous and
beautiful I'm gonna flip the brush over
and go into forever lips we'll see what
this one looks like on this side I think
I think it's really pretty look at that
oh so pretty I just wanted to come on
here and explain what happened and you
know let you guys know if you get your
palettes in from Sephora and they come
broken what you can do and what the
options are and what I think should
happen and I just I don't think it's
fair that people are being treated
differently in this situation that's
really frustrating but that's kind of my
feedback on the palette I plan on doing
a full face tutorial using new high-end
and I'm gonna include the glow kit and
I'll give my reviews in that video as
well but I know the time I'm filming it
sold out on this for a website but it is
supposed to be coming back or at least
becoming in stores so there's that I
would just I would just say good luck if
you order it from Sephora online I don't
I don't know what else to say but again
I'm just very sad that this happened I'm
sad that you know people are screaming
scandal I'm sad that so many people are
getting broken products I'm sad that you
know money's gonna be lost like it's
such a bummer initial feedback on the
palette is I think that it's really
beautiful just super metallic and
beautiful and I think that they're
really stunning shades a huge
congratulations to Nicole on her
collaboration with Anasazi a-that's it's
super cool I was really excited to
support her and I'm sorry I'll you know
so many people are getting broken
palates it just sucks but that's kind of
my initial feedback on the palette is
that I really like it if I would have
gotten everything would have been okay
and I would have tested it out you know
I don't have anything in my mind like I
would return it that I didn't like it
anything like that
so you know my overall first impression
was that I really do like this palette
and hopefully I can get it cleaned up so
I can show it better on camera for when
I do my next video when I figure the the
palette but we know in the comments down
below did you guys get your glow kit did
you get it early did you get it from
Sephora I didn't come broken what's the
for and say like what just let me know
your experiences but I know that I do
need to wrap up this video I'm sorry I
know I've probably been talking for so
long but I there's been there was like
no real structure to this video I didn't
really know what even to say or what
order to say anything in but I just
thought I would share with you guys my
experience and be able to share my
initial thoughts on the Nicole Guerrero
and Nastasia glow can't so bummed that
crappy stuff is happening but still a
really pretty glow kit for $40 I
definitely thought it was worth it and I
just wish they weren't coming broken
that's all and I wish people were being
treated the same that's really one of my
my big issues now once I found out
people are being treated differently
that really didn't sit with me very well
so I'm glad that's before I got back and
you know said they'll treat me like how
they're treating other people so that's
good but thank you guys so much for
watching I really do appreciate it I'm
sorry I couldn't do a better video with
this palette I'm sorry I really wanted
to get this to review I know a lot of
you guys were saying that you were
bummed because you wanted me to review
it as well but I'll try to give my
palette cleaned up so I can do some
butter swatches and you know share on
Instagram and things like that and have
my next video where I can talk more in
depth about it but I apologize I feel
like I wasn't able to do my job very
well so I'm sorry about that you guys
it's going to be it for this video thank
you guys so much for watching if you did
enjoy it or you're just sad it sounds
like me give this video a thumbs up
