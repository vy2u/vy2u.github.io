the classic red lip I'm so excited to
bring you guys this tutorial I know that
I promised a more like simple glam look

hope that you guys like this like I said
it's super easy not using a lot of eye
products and it's pretty quick as well
so I really hope that you guys love how
this one it came out if you're new here

subscribe button down below if you post
videos almost every single day because i
love what i do is so i hope that you
will hit the subscribe button and hang
around and be notified for my future
videos but if you would like to see how
I got this simple glam classic holiday
look please keep watching so I'm going
to start with the face for this one
because my face is like freaking out it
is that time of the month where I
purchase Chips Ahoy chocolate ice cream
and swiss cake rolls all in one grocery
trip it's just that time so don't judge
me but I'm going to start off with
priming my face I'm going to use the
make up for ever step 1 this is the
smoothing a primer
for a foundation i'm going to use the l
oreal pro glow i am in 207 sand beige
i'm just going to put some of that on my
morphe and 439 one of my favorite
foundation brushes what the foundation
is good to shake it up but then you got
to be careful when you open it because
it'll like come out right away so it's
going to put some directly on to my
brush you feel so weird because I have
curly hair i'm actually going somewhere
right after I get done with this look
and it's like kind of like a nicer event
dinner type of thing and so I was just
sitting here alone in my house I was
like oh I'll call my hair and like try
to do something fancy and now I'm like
Who am I I never do anything with my
hair I'm so boring with her probably
because I have no idea how to do
anything with my hair for a concealer
i'm going to use the Maybelline fit me
concealer one of like my all-time
favorites I'm in the shade can light so
I'm apply this to the under eyes
and then also the center of my face to
highlight and also conceal few areas too
then to buff that in I'm going to use my
new favorite brush for this it's the
sigma f 79 I love this brush
then i also like once i get like done
doing the concealer i also bring it on
to my eyelids to act as a eyeshadow
primer as well to set the under a powder
i'm going to use the new brightening
Rumaki powder from kat von d i'm in the
shade peach this is a new purchase for
me but since I've got it I've just been
obsessed with it I cannot stop using it
so I'm just using a damp Beauty Blender
to apply this to my under eyes and then
while that's setting just because I'm
having some like face issues right now
and because I know I'm going somewhere i
want my foundation to stay in place i'm
just going to take my better skin skin
transforming powder from maybelline it's
just like a pressed powder and i'm going
to use the little like applicator it
comes with and I'm just going to apply
this for the other areas of my face to
help set the foundation
I really like this powder and I think it
helps give the skin like a really
flawless airbrushed finish is like what
I think when I think of this powder I
thought I'd hit pan in a spot I was like
what no no you don't i'm not ready good
funny how we like complain like oh we
don't go through make up fast enough and
then it just sits there and then we buy
new things but then we hit pan and
something I'm like ooh it's like no
should be a good thing to cream contour
i'm going to use the knicks sculpt and
highlight duo i'm going to use the
contour side to do some cream contouring
so i just start up like towards my ear
and then bring it around you don't want
to bring a contour too low you kind of
want to like hug it around your
cheekbone and then I also just do a
little bit on the forehead not a ton now
the time because I don't feel like I
need it so you do you then I'm just
going to take my makeup sponge to blend
that out this is the sponge that came
and with the pier cosmetics cameo
contour if you purchased the Cameo
contour stick it comes with its own
blending sponge so that is what this one
is honey if someone called me out I said
something about how I've never tried
like the original pink beauty blender
and someone said like no I've seen you
use a pink beauty blender and I'm like
have I and I thought I was like oh it's
the one from here so it's not like the
Beauty Blender Beauty Blender but it's
like peers version of the Beauty Blender
and then two bronze i'm going to use the
physicians formula butter bronzer and my
morphe m530 my favorites brush to bronze
the skin with this is such a pretty
bronzer a lot of times when I cream
contour I don't feel like I need to go
look quite as heavy on the bronzer and
this is just such a pretty like like a
lighter bronzer I mean it's still a
bronzer and it's still going to show up
but it just is more like natural looking
in my opinion so I really like the
sainted stroke story even though
physicians formula to me is always on
like the higher end of drugstore prices
but still still can get it at the
drugstore
and then I'm just going to wipe away the
excess powder with my morphe III in the
cap on the powder I haven't noticed
anything like flashback wise I've been
testing it out I've probably use the
smell like five or six times I keep
trying to use it so I can get a full
review going for it but I've been
testing it and taking photos taking
photos with flash I haven't noticed
anything yet so just been really liking
this powder but you always want to make
sure that you dust away all the excess
powder and so I know that I've done
boulder makeup tutorials in the past
couple of weeks here and I promise like
a super simple look so that is exactly
what this is we're doing something very
super super soft and subtle on the eyes
and I'm really excited to try this out
so I'm going to dip into some makeup
geek shadows I have my little makeup
geek z pellet right here and let's see
I'm going to grab my morphe m4 for one
and a little bit of creme brulee it's
similar to like Anastasio Beverly Hills
Birkin just a really soft brown color
I'm going to apply this into the crease
and towards the outer part of the eye
and just really like all over I mean I'm
just going to be really sloppy with this
color and just kind of get it all over
the eye I did fill in my brows off
camera I used the benefit cosmetics goof
proof penciled in shade number two and
then I also used the Ready Set brow to
set them and it's dark here it's it's
it's nighttime here and by night time I
mean it's five o'clock but its pitch
black in Iowa so I'm doing this only by
the light of my soft box that I have and
I'm like I think I went kind of hard on
my eyebrows but I can't sometimes I
can't tell when you're doing something
with such a bright light it's like what
in the world am I going to look like in
the end I don't know but sometimes I
also think brows look funny if you do
them before you have like your completed
makeup look on so hopefully this makeup
look look
everything all together
that is it fri shadow not even played
around this is one of my favorite I
looks to do and like when I'm just
having like a really casual simple day I
truly will just put creme brulee all
over my eyelids and call it a day but
we're gonna spice things up a little bit
site I'm going to do a wing this is
going to be my first time using the
TARDIS double-take liner I mentioned
this in my recent haul video I picked
this up from Sephora so it's double
ended so as gel liner on one side and
then a liquid liner on an other and this
is the side I'm going to do to create a
wing now I don't want a super super bold
wing I just wanted a really pretty like
classic simple winged liner look will
that be how this turns out I don't I
don't know you just really never know
with your wings what in the world that
they're gonna do but that's what we're
aiming for let's see how it turns out
and let's see how this pencil works i'm
so nervous i hope it's good this bed is
a lot of pigment okay good to know good
start so with my winged liner I always
spill in the eye first and then I come
in with the wing home so nervous
you
okay so that one was definitely not the
best thing I've ever done in my life I
might actually need to go fix that off
camera but this is super super pigmented
like I feel like you have to be really
really careful at this one it could be
just because you know it's brand new and
everything but who a little bit goes a
long way let's try the other ID and see
if we have better success
you
I thought I was a little bit better I
feel like this liner is going to be good
for like really bold liner I don't feel
like it's as good for more precise liner
which is weird because it has such a
thin tip like you would think it'd be
fine either way but i don't know i just
find when i lay it down and especially
to like draw the line back it was kind
of like going everywhere so mmm I don't
know I'm why not to play around with
this one I mean this is the first time
that I'm using it but that's just kind
of like what I saw out of this but ok I
mean it's very is very black it's very
black and I like that ok so I did decide
to fix this wing real quick off camera
and then I applied a lash and have my
other lation but up put on as well I do
like the liner I'm definitely going to
have to get used to it but once I fixed
it up i just took a small makeup wipe
and wiped off the wing and then did it
again I just had to hold my lid pretty
tight and draw it along and then it was
fine I don't typically like to do that I
don't want to pull around my under eyes
because it can cause to like wrinkles
and all that fun stuff so but that one I
don't know I think I just think maybe
it's like super super pigmented and its
brand new so it's got lots of product
ready to go but yeah I don't know I'll
keep trying it I'll let you guys know
what I think but i am applying these I
lower lashes in gilded it's some of
their Luck's lashes that are new I got
mine at alpha I did mention them in my
previous haul video and they are like
there's super glamorous I wasn't I mean
I knew that they were going to be glam
but I was like oh dang when I put a bomb
like okay and then I just have some of
my duo dark tone adhesive so I'm just
going to pop this other one on so when I
do my lashes I like to come from the top
and then place them on
and then I make sure the middle is down
first and then I work on the ends then
I'll just take my finger and kind of
press everything in brand new lashes are
usually pretty easy to pop right on so
these are I lower and gilded so now i'm
going to go ahead and finish off the
eyes so even though we kept the I look
pretty simple and you know a pretty
simple wing this is a pretty simple wing
for me but then we have some really like
pretty ba-ba-boom eyelashes going on so
I really like the way though this is
turning out ok so I'm going to take the
same liner I'm going to use the gel side
of it now we'll see how this goes I'm
not apply this into the water line
I'm pretty well those really smooth so
yeah that one was nice so far that would
be good because i don't have a gel black
liner at the moment so i'm glad that i
liked that one and then I'm going to
come back into my makeup geek palette
I'm going to grab out cocoa bear with my
morphe 36 this is just kind of a richer
brown color and this is what I'm going
to place on my lower lash line and just
kind of smoke it out a little bit
nothing likes super dramatic but I
typically will always have something on
my lower lashline I just feels like it
kind of like ties everything together
and I wanted to use something a little
bit darker than just creme brulee so
that's why it won't cook over
do you finish off the face I'm going to
jump into my Smashbox blush and
highlight trio this is in which one is
this Culver City coral I'm going to use
this first shade right here in my morphe
efore brush and just dust this on to the
cheeks then into that same palette I'm
going to take the highlight shade here
on the end so my morphe m 501 brush and
then i'm going to apply this to the tops
of my cheekbones I do not think these
blush and highlight palettes have gotten
enough love from Smashbox they are
really good i've tried a couple
different of the palettes and look at
that that's so pretty and i just think
they're phenomenal so i really wanted to
bust into it then i'm also going to take
some highlight down the bridge of my
nose like about halfway down my nose and
also just a little bit on the tip of my
nose and then a little bit on the
Cupid's bow so to finish off a simple
and classic holiday look I feel like I
would need to go into some red lipstick
so this is from giorgio armani it's one
of the new lip magnets and this one is
in shade 400 for all it's supposed to be
a good universal red shade so we'll go
ahead and try it out I haven't been sure
what I've really thought of these yet so
I'm going to try out the second one that
was sent to me from Influenster this is
what the wand looks like we'll go ahead
and see I haven't tried this red on my
lips yet so let's see what it looks like
and these applicators like I don't know
if it's just me but I have to go back in
and get more product like I can't just
do my bottom lip with one swipe that's
pretty color I like the color so far I
like it better than the other color that
was sent to me it was a pink one I used
it in which my purple smokey eye
tutorial and I just did not like that
color on me yeah I gotta go back in for
some more product to finish off the top
lip so this is the georgia armani lip
magnet in 404 all so far I like it I
feel like it kind of goes on just a
little bit like streaky but so far I
like the color so I don't know where it
throughout the night and see what I
think but I just felt like I needed to
pair this with a nice classic red lip
that's exactly what we did so there we
go once you have the lip on I'm just
going to go ahead and spray my face with
some skin to Navia their makeup
finishing spray and then this look is
complete alright guys I was going to be
it for this tutorial I really hope that
you guys enjoyed it and found it helpful
I really love the way that they look
came out which is good because I am on
my way to a dinner right now I gotta go
get changed but I have my hair curled
which makes me feel weird because I
never do anything with my hair but had
some time on my hands today so I thought
why not curl my hair but I'm getting
ready to go off to event and it's a
holiday to dinner and I feel like I have
like the holiday look nailed down pretty
