video is going to be a makeup tutorial
on this very simple basic makeup look
right here I want to show you guys my
like simple basic everyday makeup look
maybe I only have a few minutes to get
ready but I still want a really like
fresh look this look is mainly focused
on like making sure i have a very
flawless space but also a very
highlighted face if you can see my
highlight the eyes are super super super
simple if you want you can pop false
lashes on with this one but because this
is like my everyday look I don't wear
lashes every day so I don't have any
lashes on in this look I am also very
excited because I tried out a new
product for the lips in this tutorial I
did do a first impression but my camera
was not filming so you get like my
second impression but I tried out the
new Smashbox insta matte lipstick
transformer which takes a glossy or
creamy lipstick and turns it Matt and as
you can see it did a good job but you'll
see in the video the befores and afters
when using that product so yeah if you
would like to see my simple basic
everyday makeup look back and do my face
which normally I would do my eyes but
because the eyes are so so simple in
this look figure I might as well just do
my face first I'm going to use the clean
slate timeless smoothing primer this is
from Tarte I got a little deluxe sample
with my latest tart order so that is
what it looks like I've used it a few
times it was very similar to the Makeup
Forever smoothing primer I thought so
I'm just going to put that all over my
face
for foundation I'm going to use the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation looks
like this and I'm going to apply that
with my Sigma flat kabuki brush it is
the f80 brush of course I brought
everything down here and forgot to bring
like hair clip bobby pins anything like
that I never can remember put my hair
back when I do these drives me crazy
since this look is mostly like being
about like fresh face that's why i use a
looming foundation i have quite a few
but i really really do like this True
Match Lumi I also do like the l'oreal
cushion foundation the new cushion
foundation but I honestly feel like I've
been using it so much that I'm like kind
of running low so I tried to switch it
up for today especially because after I
finished filming this makeup tutorial
I'm just immediately taking it all off
because I need to shower and wash my
hair tonight in sealer I'm going to use
the Maybelline better skin concealer and
then I'm going to use my morphe g2 brush
to buff that in I have said several
times this is like my favorite brush for
this definitely recommend it since this
is just like basic makeup I'm just
concealing I'm not really going to do a
whole lot of like highlighting for this
today so I'm just going to mainly focus
this on my under eyes kind of take that
concealer and buff it over my eyelids as
well and have that act as my eyelid
primer
to set that I'm going to use the wet and
wild mega glow contouring palette and I
use the shade right here to set the
under eyes this wet and wild palette has
just given me so much life I get so many
questions now like on my Instagram
photos like the contour that i'm using
and I swear I thought on my nose like
nearly every single photo I'm like it's
the wet and wild contouring palette if
you guys followed me on snapchat you
know the struggle was so real trying to
find this I had to go to all these
different stores and I was like driving
around town one day trying my hardest to
find this palette and in the shade that
I need it I finally found it and I was
like this better be worth it and it is
so worth it next I'm going to work the
eyes a little bit and the eyes are so so
simple this is my little makeup geek Z
palette these are the makeup geek
shadows that I own I only on 7 nothing
crazy but I'm going to mix peach
smoothie and creme brulee I'm going to
mix those together sometimes I use one
or the other sometimes I mix them
together it's just whatever I'm feeling
today I want to mix them both together
I'm just going to apply this on the
crease of my eyes kind of blending it
out and up when there's a little bit
less product i kind of like swoosh it
all over my eyes but mainly i'm just
putting this in my crease to have some
sort of color on my eyes but nothing too
crazy
I just love this look because it's so
fast it's so simple I feel like I'm
using a lot of affordable products is
this all affordable this like might be
very close to being all affordable i
think my mascara is going to be high end
but that's all but it's just so fast so
easy if i'm going to hurry i need to get
going i go and i just love it because
when the eyes are so simple if you make
your face look absolutely like fresh
flawless and you have like a bang and
highlighter going on you still get so
many compliments even though it's so
easy for my under i'm going to put a
little bit of a darker shade under there
i'm going to come in with cocoa bear
from makeup geek it's just a really
great brown and i'm going to put that on
this like big pencil brush from BH
Cosmetics and just smudge that into my
lower lashline nothing crazy here make
it like pretty smudgy I'm not being very
precise I'm not putting it down with a
precise like a flat definer brush this
kind of making it a little messy and on
my waterline I'm going to use the Rimmel
exaggerated in the shade in wait in the
nude is the shade so it's just a beige
nude eyeliner pencil and I'm going to
put that into my bottom waterline I like
using nude or beige or even i use
crybaby a lot from colour-pop for this
and it's a really like light purple
lavender shade and when you use lighter
colors like this on the waterline it
just makes your eyes look more awake and
a little bit bigger so that's a trick
that I like to do I'm just going to run
through my eyebrows real crook real
quick using the Maybelline brow drama
it's just a wand and so when I'm in a
hurry but I still want my brows to look
like a little bit decent i won't use my
NYX micro brow pencil I'll just run the
gel through these it is blonde so it's
not a clear gel so kind of like fills
them in just a little bit even though i
need to get my brows waxed here soon but
it fills in like some of the sparse
wats and then since it is a gel it kind
of keeps them in place as well so that's
what we're going to do back to the face
real quick I'm going to go back to the
wet and wild contouring palette I'm
going to take it the contour shade this
time and this is an angled brush from
bhcosmetics it's my favorite one to use
for contouring because of the angle on
it I just feel like it makes it really
easy to get into the cheekbones and then
I'm just going to contour away with this
look since again the eyes are so basic
like I want the contour to be really
noticeable as well so what I do for my
contour is basically like start at the
top of my ear and go down I don't go all
the way down I don't go all the way to
my lip but I go about three-fourths of
the way down just rub back and forth and
then start to bring it up you never want
to bring your contour down because then
you're defeating the purpose of a
contour which is to create the
cheekbones so that's what I'm going to
do I'm just so you guys know I get a lot
of questions about the wet and wild
palette and it is very very pigmented so
you want to go in with a light hand and
build it up so that's why I'm coming
back a few times because if you go in
with a heavy hand it can be really hard
to blend out and then your face will
kind of look like muddy and not really
not really what we're going for
so my husband and I finally got netflix
we have never had netflix and my little
brother was down here a few weeks ago
and he was like i'll have netflix i'll
give me my password units can you know
try it out if you like it and so it was
like a week after John gave us the
password we finally went into it and we
watched new girl because everyone was
like you have to watch new girl it is so
good it's so funny blah blah blah so
we're like all right you know we'll
watch new girl that shows role finding
that yeah we were having a great time we
left while we were eating popcorn the
dog was sleeping it was a good night but
if you guys have any other shows to
recommend like everyone said that we
have to watch that making a murderer or
making a murderer whatever it's called
but you guys have any other shows you
like on netflix let us know because
let's start trying that out i'm also
going to take this contour shade and put
it on my forehead like super super super
close to my hairline but keeping the
center for you want to keep the center
of your forehead light and then i'm also
going to put that on my jawline this is
just your your contouring spots and then
I just kind of use like what's left over
my brush and hit the sides of my nose if
I want to contour my nose I would use
like a very small precise brush to
contour it out but because I don't hate
my nose and because this is a simple
look I'm not going to go through like
that kind of contouring blush I swear is
like key in this look this is from
Milani and it is the luminoso blush and
it is just so freaking gorgeous all my
subscribers told me when I said I was
looking for a new drug store blush
everyone told me Milani Luminoso and I'm
like I don't know why didn't have this
before it's so beautiful especially with
a look like this when we're trying to be
just like really illuminated and glowy
and fresh we're like ready for the
spring weather this is gorgeous it has
it's like a peach blush and it has some
shimmer to it but nothing like too
overwhelming and I swear I could sit
here all day and just keep loading up on
this blush and it like would not look
bad like it would
totally fine so because it is like
focusing on the face I do put quite a
bit on here and because it has the
shimmer and there are two I think it
helps as well so just applying this to
apples on my cheeks and blending it back
towards my hairline and I'm just using
another brush from bhcosmetics one of
their I think it's just a regular old
blush brush but I actually have so many
BH Cosmetics sets of makeup brushes that
that's where like all these bh brushes
come from i know i need to order some
more brushes so if you guys have any
favorites just in general please let me
know go in with my mascara now for some
reason I always like tend to put mascara
on like mascara and highlighters of the
things that I always put on last and
sometimes I forget about them but
because this look again is just very
simple very basic I'm not doing fake
eyelashes I'm not doing eyeliner on top
I'm not messing around trying to get a
wing trying to make my liner perfect you
nobody got time for that when we're
doing our simple makeup so the eyes are
very very simple but i am going to come
in with the two-faced of better than sex
mascara i absolutely love this mascara I
think it's bomb highly recommend it I
have this big one of it i have many of
it and i love it
then we move on highlighter which I feel
like just makes this look and this
highlighter combination I just think
it's amazing I've mentioned in favorites
videos when I want a really fierce
highlight this is what I go for and I
mixed two products the first is the
Watts up highlighter and this is from
Benefit Cosmetics mine is a little
deluxe sample because it came in a
benefit box but they have like bigger
ones as well you can either either use a
brush I don't really recommend like
putting it right to your skin because
that might be weird I typically just go
in with my finger I go in with my ring
finger I get some product on there and
then I put it where I want it so where I
want my highlight is right at the tops
of my cheekbones and this what's up is a
cream highlighter so I put it on tops of
my cheekbones I kind of bring it in a
little bit to the center of my cheek so
you get that like pop of shine right in
the center of your cheek and then I'll
kind of bring out the highlighter as
well around my temples a little bit
above my eye rose like I said this look
is like all about the highlighter so I
get a little crazy do the same thing on
the other side
and I'm also going to take that
highlighter and put some down the center
of my nose a little on right at the tip
of my nose in on my Cupid's bow and then
over top of that I'm going to use my
mary-lou manizer this is from the bomb
it's a very very pretty like pearlized
highlighter and i'm using a fan brush
this one is from morphe i'm just going
to hit the fan brush in there and then
go on top of that highlight like like
can you see that like I hope you can see
that I can see it in my mirror I hope
you guys can see that too so we're just
going to make like a big sea around your
face that's how I think of it just a big
sea oh I mean even my dog is looking up
from her spot sitting in the Sun she's
like girl I see you I see you
people read and see me coming for like
miles and we like you see that girl I
see that girl now we move on to lips and
then we're done okay guys so I'm super
bummed because I filmed the lip segments
and i did a first impression and
apparently I didn't hit record and none
of it recorded so I actually win and
wipe the lipstick off and I'm going to
do it again on camera because I want you
guys to see this but I'm so frickin
bummed because I feel like my first
impression was pretty funny I don't know
what happened i went to look at the
footage it was gone and I was like
really so we're gonna do it again so
what I wanted to show you guys is that I
have the new Smashbox insta Matt
lipstick transformer this is a little
sample that I got my latest sephora
order and i wanted to show it to you
guys so you can see like i put some on
my hand here and used it and I put too
much out and I was like bummer but now
we're going to do it again so you know
but basically what this is is that it
says that it will take any like creamy
lipstick and make it mat with the
product now they did say that it's
nothing like if you have a super super
creamy lipstick it doesn't work for like
lip glosses you know that sort of thing
but just like a basic glossy creamy
lipstick this should be able to make it
Matt and so I asked my snapchat family
if you guys wanted to see a first
impressions video on it and some people
responded back and said yes but it
wasn't anything overwhelming like how
like sometimes when i passed other
questions about videos and etc like I
get like an overwhelming response I
didn't feel like I was overwhelmed with
the yeses so I decided to just put this
in my makeup tutorial and we could do a
first impression that way but that is
what i'm going to do again hopefully
we're actually recording this time are
we I like to do when I do simple looks
like this like very simple eyes simple
face that sort of thing i like to use a
bold lip I don't like to use a bold lip
when I do like a smoky eye a cut crease
lots of sparkle or glitter I usually
keep the lips more like new
or pinks but for a simple look I think a
bold up is the way to go so what I'm
going to do is use rum Richie this is
from Maybelline so that is what the
shade looks like it is a glossy lipstick
so I'm going to put this on first let
you guys see that it's glossy and they
use the instant matte lipstick
transformer so you can see that my lips
are kind of like already a little bit
red because I just wiped it off and
gonna do it again alright so the
lipstick is on if you got if you guys
can tell it is definitely a glossy
lipstick hopefully you can see the glass
from here i can assume two guys out for
this part but it is a glossy lipstick so
that i'm going to take the little bit of
the intimate transformer and i've
watched videos on it and basically what
people are doing is putting it like on
their skin and then dabbing it on to
their finger and putting that on the
lips and it I have seen people use it
with actual like full-size product and I
think it says on there like in the
directions like don't take that and put
it directly on your lips so I'm just
going to take a little bit on my ring
finger and dab it on
and I mean can you guys already tell the
difference for my top lip and my bottom
lip like this stuff really work those so
cool and this is it after the instant
Matt transformer like can you guys tell
it's matt it's no longer glossy isn't
that cool and i'll show you my finger
right this is what my finger looks like
so there is a little bit of light color
transfer but it doesn't really take
anything off your lips so i just think
that is so very cool so if you guys like
the matte lipstick look but you don't
like how liquid lipsticks feel and you
don't like that they're you know a lot
of the formulas are very drying on the
lips and you get kind of cakey and
crusty if you still want the matte look
but the comfort of a regular lipstick
then this product could be very very
cool for you guys I know there are a few
like DIY is out there as well so you can
always look up the DIY versions if you
want but this product seems pretty darn
cool so I will make sure that I link
that in the description box below for
you guys of course with all the products
that I've used as well will be down
there below but I don't know I thought
it was pretty darn cool my first
impression was a lot more exciting than
the second time around himself on my
camera wasn't filming but still very
cool I'm very excited I got a sample of
this because a lot of times I have a lot
of like regular bold lip sticks I'm a
whole lot because I like the liquid
lipsticks so much more but now that I
can get a matte look with them I think I
could be using them a lot more so this
is very cool very excited super happy I
got a sample if you guys can get this
sample anywhere you cannot maybe get
that because I feel like there's
actually quite a bit in this little guy
so I feel like I could get quite a few
uses out of it and i'm pretty happy good
way to end a makeup tutorial and this is
the final luck did you guys think that
was pretty simple I thought it was
pretty simple this might have been one
of the easiest micro tutorials I have
yet to film probably gonna be pretty
simple so that's why I did like the more
chattiness even though I felt like I
really didn't chat all that much because
then i got so focused and what I was
doing that I forgot that I could
actually talk to you guys in this one
I wasn't going to do a voiceover avi
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial please do give it a thumbs up
if you did because that would be amazing
tutorials are still kind of hard for me
to film I'm not super comfortable doing
them yet but something like so easy and
simple like this helps me out a lot
mention all of the products that I used
will be in the description box below I
think only was it only the mascara that
I used that I think was high end I do
use a sigma brush and that is a little
bit more on the pricey side but other
than that this is also a very affordable
makeup tutorial look which is awesome
but of course you know you have a
favorite drugstore mascara you use it
you have favorite affordable brushes you
want to use use them I heard wet'n'wild
has come out with new brushes and it
seems like everyone and their mother is
like raving over these brushes so if you
need some more affordable brush options
check out what wild I feel like they're
really stepping up their game I love
that contour palette so so much because
I really hope you guys did enjoy this
video please make sure you subscribe
before you go and I will catch you guys
real soon in my next one I
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
