see some of my skincare favorites let's
go ahead and get started
so first up I do want to say that this
video is sponsored by patch ology which
is to me is a really big deal to me and
it makes me really excited I recently
just posted a Beauty empties video I'll
have that link down below and I have a
lot of Pathology featured in that video
I have been trying their skincare for
several several months now and there's
really not anything from pathology that
I've tried that I haven't loved that
hasn't worked for me first off I'm going
to run through some of my favorites a
book by geology between o how I use them
and how they benefit me touch ology also

here that's for 25 percent off at patch
ology calm and you can find it pathology
at Ulta so I will have everything a link
down below but to start one of the
things that I want to start with and I
know this was mentioned in my empties
video as well is one item that just
impressed me so very much it is their
smart mud no mess mud mask this was
really cool to me because I'm a big fan
of mud mask charcoal laughing of things
like that big fans of them but they are
so messy that it can get really annoying
and sometimes I don't do those masks
because I get frustrated at
let's see they are hummus II you know I
give them out in my hair and I have mud
all over my sink and I have to clean so
these are super cool because they are
mud masks but in a sheet mask so there
is no less of them which i think is
amazing so this is what the outer
packaging looks like and then when you
open it up I mean it is a dark grey mud
mask that you put on your face you leave
it sit for 10 minutes and then when you
take it off you have some residue left
on your face but not usually too much
and you just rinse your face and boom
you are done I loved it I thought it was
so very cool I will say that this sticks
to your face a lot too and when you
unfold it it comes in two different
sections for the top half of your face
and the bottom half of your face when
you unfold it you just need to be really
careful because it is so sticky that it
can also stick to itself don't want to
go back to like any other type of mud
mask because these are just is so
helpful and I just really appreciate
them I also like that it's only a 10
minute mask which i think is very cool
because sometimes I don't have time to
spend 20 and 30 minutes on a sheet mask
or mud mask I really really love more
sheet masks also if you guys watched my
empties video you know that I am
obsessed with sheet masks these at two
masks from pressure ology one is the
hydrate flash mask and then the other
one is the illuminate flash mask so they
kind of do is exactly what they say so
the hydrate comes in this blue one and
it is for if you have very dry skin dry
patches things like that it is really
going to put a bunch of hydration back
into your skin and moisture back into
your skin
and also what I like about these is that
they're only five minute masks and they
truly do work in five minutes it's not
just like five minutes you take them off
and you're like unless what you think
you can tell the difference when you put
these on for only five minutes and again
who's someone who is very busy and
constantly on the go
sometimes I just don't have the 30
minutes to spend with a mask on my face
so these five minute masks are so great
this one says it's for intense
moisturize and has hyaluronic acid and
vitamin b5 in it I also love hyaluronic
acid it is like the best for putting
hydration back into your skin recently
discovered hyaluronic acid and I'm like
where has this been my whole life is
amazing so the sheet mask is still
Raunak asset as well which is incredible
and then the other sheet mask is the
illuminate flash mask this is for if you
struggle with like dull skin and you
need to brighten your skin back up you
need to illuminate the skin I would say
it check out the illuminate a flash mask
again it is a 5-minute mask so you can
get it done in plenty of time so some of
the ingredients in here that I thought
were interesting the licorice extract is
to brighten and even your skin come skin
tone and then as a great food seed
extract provides antioxidant protection
from environmental toxins there's also
vitamin C in here which is one of my
favorite parts of the mask because that
encourages collagen production and
improves the skin elasticity so I think
that is amazing these two masks I mean
are really they're really good it just
depends on what you need like in the
winter especially that was when I
discovered these hydrate masks and
that's an I became obsessive em because
I struggle with dry skin and dry patches
so much in the winter but then also when
I found the illuminate and loved the
ingredients in here this one is a really
good - so these are awesome sheet masks
muscles I mentioned that I obviously a
makeup free in this video I am skincare
videos in the past and I typically and
makeup free and them because I'm like
why not we're talking about skincare you
can see my skin I have no fears about
going makeup free on camera and it
actually kind of fun I could just sit
down and film I didn't have to worry
about getting ready or anything thing
we're going to talk about it's actually
not for our face it's for our feet oh
yes it is
the pathology posh peel so this is
actually a peel for your feet and I just
do this a couple days ago I don't know
if I will be able to have all of the
footage in this video but I am filming
it for Instagram so what is this you
want to soak your feet in water for a
bit and then this little guy comes in
each of them this is the activating
essence and you have these little socks
I'm not going to open them up fully on
here because I guess there will be the
video on Instagram there is a pair of
like booties in here like plastic
booties and you would pour the essence
in here and then you would pull up your
feet into them now this guy you do have
to hang out for a while a lot of
Pathology is like the 5 to 10 minutes
but this one you do for 60 minutes so
you just leave them on your feet but I
mean it isn't about living you can walk
around and all that stuff so you leave
it on for 60 minutes and take it off and
then within three to seven days you'll
see your feet start to peel I have done
this a couple times in the past and I
remember I did it last summer and it is
crazy but you do have to remember that
it does take a few days so I just did it
three days ago I believe it was so my
feet are not peeling yet but they feel
very tight so that's kind of first thing
that you'll notice within a couple of
days is your feet feel very tight and
then you will notice the peeling and it
basically is peeling off like the dry
dead skin on your feet it is super gross
but it is super cool and it basically is
like giving you new feet it's like when
you go for a pedicure and they're like
scraping the dead skin off your feet
that's what this is doing at home it's
really cool like I said I've done it in
the past and I just did it a couple days
ago to struggle with kind of like achy
feet I would say check out the posh feel
it doesn't hurt it's not painful or
anything like that but I do think it is
very effective
these two are both masks for your under
eyes these are mars-like the regular
ones I guess you could call them there's
a five-minute hydrogels again five
minutes but they are gels for your under
eye area and I love these I wear high
gel so much especially Monday mornings
to have caffeine which food circulation
and after the hydrolyzed collagen to
moisturize and you only have to put them
on for five minutes and then you
instantly notice you don't have to put
these like in a fridge or anything like
that they're just very cooling on their
own and have gone through one full box
of these and another half box and oh I
have another full box or two makes me so
excited so I think that's very cool and
then these are more like your nighttime
i jealous which I thought was really
interesting that they have that anti
aging retinol and peptides in them which
I was like tell me more because I also
recently learned about retinol this year
and since then I've also been obsessed
with that ingredients a lot of good
ingredients in here for anti-aging and
again these are only five minute masks
so when you're doing your nighttime
routine to blue what I'll do is like
remove my makeup and clean my face do a
mask that's what I'm doing and then when
I brush my teeth I put these
on and then after I'm brushing my teeth
I only have a couple more minutes to
wait and I can take these off put my
night cream on and go to bed some of
these very very handy so these are both
eye gel mask class I don't from
pathology that I want to talk about this
you saw so many of these in my at these
videos these are their five-minute
hydrogel like renewal patches I love
these things you guys might know that I
love liquid lipsticks I wear a liquid
lipstick almost every single day it can
be a little dry and cracked from how
much a liquid lipstick that I wear and
these are like an instant refresh to my
lips they're just a lip gel so they are
shaped like a pair of lips and you just
put them over you leave them on for the
five minutes so it's super quick and
easy because obviously you can't be
doing any talking while you have your
lip mask on but it's only for five
minutes I take them off they're very
cooling as well I just rub the sermon
and I'm good to go it's an instant
refresh for your lips which i think is
absolutely amazing yes you saw my
empties videos a ton of these I've been
through at least two full boxes these
slippery notes because I wear them so
much very youtuber if you do lip swatch
videos do this before you do the lip
swatches because it will really save
your lips but I'm just obsessed with
these I wanted to jump into some of my
other favorite sheet masks as well
because I've been getting absolutely
about my favorite sheet masks so we have
the pathology sheet mask that I love and
then also bio bell I have been loving
their sheet masks I like to get this
it's called my diary of beauty secrets
basically inside you get six different
sheet masks so you can get bio Bell on
their website and then they are also
bought at Ulta you open it up like this
you have all of the different sheet
masks in there and you can choose which
one you want we have one to smooth them
brighten skin enhance your skin's
natural glow diminish the appearance of
fine lines to hydrate and vitalize I
mean they have a lot of different
options in here you can of course buy
all of their sheet masks separately but
I just think it's like a better deal to
buy those set and then I can kind of
take into because you know your skin's
not always the same from day to day
you're like oh this is what I want to
focus on today I can go into my diary of
Secrets and picked my favorite sheet
masks so bio bell definitely up there
for my favorite sheet masks and some of
my other favorite sheet masks these are
from
and P I have been using these for a very
long time and I've gone through a lot of
them as well these are super cute
because the sheet masks is actually like
looks like an animal so it's just kind
of funny when you put them on like this
one is the dragon and it's a soothing
mask and then this one is the otter and
this is for moisture and hydration they
have a lot of these as well and they can
also be found at Ultra but yes ecology
bio bell and S&amp;amp;P are my favorite sheet
masks very kind of brand loyal person I
would say with my makeup with my skin
care even with like clothes of what I
thought I would do is go through my
brand's first where I have multiple
products and then at the end I can go
into the items that I only have you know
one thing from each brand so one brand
that I have been loyal to for a very
long time is Feli CLE I'm still not even
sure I'm saying this correctly but
silica Li I've been using for probably
two years and I've gone through a lot of
their products when I really loved them
one of my absolute favorites though is
their moisturizer this is the olestra
referring ultra texture perfecting
treatment moisturizer it's for
lightweight luminous finish clarifying
and anti-wrinkle I've been through one
other Jarvis and then I'm almost gone
out of this one as well one of my
favorite moisturizers it is super
lightweight on the skin it smells so
good it just like peps me up in the
morning I think that they really release
nice moisturizer I also really love
their loonie bright seeds this is their
multi faded Firma corrective complex
that has vitamin C and b3 and orange
stem cells
I love vitamin C it's great for the skin
a lot of my skincare you'll see will
have vitamin C in it you saw that from
technology as well I think it's a really
important ingredient for skincare so
this I think is fantastic and then the
other item that I've really been loving
from selling CLE is a mask this is their
detox tea break cream to foam
effervescent masks to because it's only
a 5 minute mask you put it on and it
kind of looks like shaving cream on your
face but it will bubble in it's like an
oxygen facial I think dr. Brandt has an
oxygen facial this is really similar to
a start to bubble on the skin and kind
of tingle and it kind of just like
scissors and disappears it's really
crazy but I love it and it's so
hydrating and kind of like instantly I
would say brightness
your skin does it say that on here that
for oxygenating and brightening stuff
exactly what I would say that it does to
the skin and it's one of those instant
results things which I know we live in
an instant gratification kind of society
and that I feel like you definitely get
with this mask so I use this at least
once a week but these are some of my
favorites from selling crease so that
website will be down below
I mentioned it this brand recently in a
video but I have a couple items here as
well from Ella Frieda so one that I use
almost every single morning is the
facial moisturizer it's really
lightweight just very hydrating
moisturizer I don't know if you'll be
able to tell how much I have used in
there but we are getting down there I
just feel like it just feels so nice on
the skin and it almost is kind of
cooling which I also really enjoy so I
used to some every single day and then I
also have the retinol moisturizers I do
only use this a couple times a week I
did some research on retinol and it
suggested not to use it every single
night
so when I stand there throughout the
week this is what I use as my night
moisturizer retinol is also really good
for the skin and good for anti aging but
it can be it can kind of be don't want
to say like skin thinner so especially
in the summertime I'm really watching
how much retinol putting on my skin
because initely really good for your
skin at the same time and I do enjoy
this moisturizer the other end of my
house from Ella Frieda is there a
hyaluronic acid serum I was talking
about hyaluronic acid sooner I have no
idea about the instant product until I
was actually sent this from Ella Frieda
and then I did my research on hyaluronic
acid and saw how amazing it was and how
hydrating and how full of what I mean
it's just insane to me
what hyaluronic acid is and I'm so
pumped that I didn't know about it
sooner
I am almost out of this but all of these
items you tend to find on Amazon and I
will repurchase this I take this
everywhere with me even when I travel I
just think hydration for the skin the
face is so important and I love my
iconic assets there are only three items
from Ella Frieda our big time favorites
of mine a couple items here from Pixie
Beauty I've been getting more and more
into the pixie skin cares one is the
double cleanse this is in collaboration
with Carolyn Perron
and I love this and I am getting down
there but these can be found at Target
as well fight is a cleansing oil to take
off your makeup and the other side is a
cleanser to clean your face I love the
two on one idea it makes me reach for it
so much I just I use this so very often
and the other item for pixie that I use
every single night is their 24k I eat
elixir and I like this because it's just
like a little roll-on for the under eyes
which I just appreciate it's super easy
to use easy to travel with super cooling
no matter what it's always really
cooling on the eyes and I like the
effect it gives and like I mentioned in
my SDS video I use eye cream every
single night I've done it for a very
long time so I'm always using an eye
cream and I do really like this eye
elixir so these two from Pixie I enjoy
it very much
I recently mention these products in my
last makeup monthly in my favor is this
section these are from milk makeup I
have just been loving on these like I
mentioned in the video which I'll be
linked down below I feel like I really
like the packaging - I like how
convenient they are how easy to use they
are when it comes time for me to travel
and I'm throwing items in my skincare
bag I keep taking these with me because
they're so easy to travel with so this
is there Machoke cleanser is what the
matcha cleanser looks like it does have
beads I'm like you know some granules on
the inside so it's kind of like a
cleanser and very light exfoliator I do
have sensitive skin but it doesn't
irritate my skin at all but I can tell
that it's really cleaning my skin and I
enjoy it I also love the smell of it and
then this is also be much a toner so
this is what I use after the cleanser
and I have just been loving on these I
continually reach for them I kind of
went back and forth and if I should
include them because they are newer to
me but honestly I have used them a ton
since first getting them and I just felt
like I would have to mention them and
then the other items that I keep using
and mention in my makeup monthly that I
wasn't sure if I could really categorize
it as a favor but I wanted to throw it
out there but seriously this hydrating
oil stick is incredible and I got burned
on the town my chest on the fourth of
July I was using this because like I
said it's hydrating oil stick and I did
not peel from my sunburn from
for the July I did not feel and I do
appeal when I get sunburns and I think
it is because of that I put on my face I
put it on my chest I put it on the top
of my shoulders where I got burned and I
did not peel at all it's very cooling
very hydrating a lot of times what I'll
do is I will put this on just before I
go to bed instead of doing a night cream
I will put just as hydrating oil on and
I've been loving it I'm super impressed
with this I'm really really happy that I
got this because and I feel like it has
saved me over and over so these from
milk makeup the more I try some of those
my guilt the more I am impressed with
you can also kind of these pet Sephora
so they will be linked down below other
brands I want to chat about is
Dermalogica I have done I love skincare
videos I've mentioned Dermalogica in the
past I do live skincare videos on
Instagram and you see Dermalogica on
there so I'll run through these pretty
quickly this is the pre cleanse this is
just a cleansing oil to take off your
makeup it works so well it smells
amazing it smells like a spa this is the
daily super foley and again I've talked
about this product a lot in the past it
is actually powder when you pour it out
it is powder and then you mix it with
water to activate it and it is kind of a
cleanser for your face art items from
Dermalogica this is what I use every
single morning to start off my skincare
this is their special cleansing gel I
just really enjoy this I started using
it after Irene I was my celly CLE
cleanser actually and I didn't have a
replacement for it yet I started using
this and now I'm like I actually really
love this like I said I use it to take
my morning off with I think it's super
gentle on the skin but also gives it a
very clean feeling the Dermalogica
antioxidant Hydra mist this is for like
when I'm feeling a little bit lazy
usually in the evenings after I take off
my makeup if I don't want to deal with
like a lotion or a night cream or
anything like that I just spray this all
over my face it's super hydrating and
it's filled with antioxidants as well so
it's really good for your skin so I love
this and I love the convenience of it my
last two items here are going to be from
brands that I don't have like multiples
of in my favorites yet but this one is
from number 7 I have been raving about
number 7 recently I really love their
makeup and now I've been getting into
their skincare
but this is something that I've been
finding myself using almost every single
night this is their protect and perfect
intense advanced serum so glues number
seven is really known for their serums I
just happen to be trying their makeup
first and it says that you can use
morning and evening and you just apply
it all over your face it is a facial
serum I typically use this at night
because in the mornings I use my
hyaluronic acid serum so this is what I
use at night after taking my makeup off
and cleansing my face all right and that
I love but I know I have talked about in
the past this is the Tarte of friction
that stick so this is an exfoliator
stick from part again I love the
convenience factor of it it's super easy
to use so this is what it looks like on
at the inside I actually keep this in my
shower and I just put it on when I'm
like conditioning my hair and like
letting it sit for a while I put this on
in the shower and it's really easy to
wash off in the shower
I love this guy i refresh mended it a
lot in the past and I know I would
totally revise this since I ran out item
that you might have to me talk about a
lot in the past because I've been
through several of these guys it's from
a first name beauty it's their facial
radiance pads highlight by the big jars
of it they are just these little round
has right here but they are to exfoliate
tone and brighten the scan their
alcohol-free and they're safe for
sensitive skin again I mean I don't even
know how many of these I've been survey
beauty can be found on both the Sephora
and Ulta and I just you we will not
touch me without my facial gratings pads
I always have them if that's gonna be
everything for my parents at skincare
