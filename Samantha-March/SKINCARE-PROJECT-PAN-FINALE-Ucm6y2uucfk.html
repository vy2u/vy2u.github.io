today's video I'm really excited to do
because it's going to be my project pan
skincare finale video so my friend Lisa
Stevens and I started a skincare project
pan two months ago and today is our
final video so we're gonna check in and
let you know how we did trying to use up
these 10 products that we chose for this
uh skincare project pan this is my very
first project pan and it's kind of crazy
that it's over I of course will have
Lisa's at Channel and her videos a link
down below as well we did our kick off
video and then we also did a one month
check-in and now we are here at the
finale so make sure to go check out
Lisa's channel as well and her video but
if you would like to see my ten products
and how I did why don't we go ahead and
get started already so when I did the
one month check-in I said that I wasn't
feeling super confident because I had
only finished one item I was like this
is actually harder than I thought when I
did the kickoff video there were so many
products that I was like oh you know
these just have like three four five
more uses out of them no it was like ten
fifteen oh my gosh I'm not gonna finish
any of these type of reactions that I
was having but I actually did end up
finishing at nine out of the ten
products of for this project pan which I
was pretty excited about so the first
one this is what I mentioned in my
check-in video the one that I had
finished up right yeah the eye cream
this is the totally I cream I did finish
this one off pretty quickly I really do
enjoy this eye cream but I know it's
super pricey and I don't think that I
would repurchase it because there's
other eye creams that I just like a lot
more and that I feel like kind of give
me benefits like cooling or do puffy you
know things like that and while I do
like this one and I travel with it quite
a bit if I were able to get like a
deluxe size again like maybe like a
100-point perk I would snatch it up but
I don't think I would pay for the full
size but that one is done I also did
just to finish up the number seven
protect and perfect intense advanced
serum this one I finished just like four
days ago I was like know how I thought
for sure so I started here and then at
my check-in I went to here and then I
finally did just finish it off I really
enjoy number seven skin
care and especially the serums I already
do have another one of this which I'm
very happy about that's a really nice
theorem I use this in the morning like
after I cleanse my face and I really
enjoy it
next up here from Kate Somerville this
is the exfoliate intensive exfoliating
treatment or the two-minute Hollywood
facial I also really enjoy this one I do
have another one of this as well another
like mini sample of it because I do like
getting it I can't use it super often
because it's definitely very intense and
I do have sensitive skin I have
sensitive skin / normal skin right now
I'm pretty dry because of our like crazy
intense Midwest weather but typically
I'm more just like straight normal but
very sensitive not very acne prone as
well but sensitivity is definitely one
thing that I really do deal with and
because this is such an intense
exfoliator I can really only use it
about one time a week but I really do
like it and like I said I do have the
backup of it so I think this is where I
started the project pan and then I was
able to finish it off within the two
weeks so I was a glad about that like I
said I do have another one so I will be
opening that one and next up here I have
this one from Pacifica this is the sea
foam a complete face wash this was
another one that took me longer than I
thought to get through it so this is
where I started at and somehow like like
do you see where I was coming from being
like oh only a few uses left no it took
forever this is another one that I
finished like maybe a week ago like
maybe 10 days maybe 10 days ago it took
forever I think it's because it's very
it's very liquidy and you really do not
need a lot and it foams up considerably
on the face so you really don't need a
lot with this product so it took me a
while to finish up but I did really like
this one it can also remove makeup so a
lot of times like if I use like a makeup
wipe and I felt like I didn't quite get
all my makeup off I would come in with
this cleanser because it helps to get
everything else off the skin so I do
like this one I'm not sure if I would
repurchase I know you can get Pacifica
skincare at like uLTA Beauty and Target
maybe if I saw it on sale I might get it
but it does it takes a really long time
to get through that I did not realize
how long it would take one here I don't
know if this is kind of cheating because
I used the majority of the product
and then I realized that I don't like it
anymore and so I kind of just let myself
give up on it this is from botanics it's
the hydrating day cream but I mean it's
basically gone right like I mean yes I
could definitely be scraping the sides
to get more out but it's pretty much
completely used up and I think because I
noticed this I was using it as my
moisturizer and I used up the other
moisturizer in this project pan and so I
was like okay like this is your go-to
moisturizer now and there would be so
many mornings where I went to reach for
it and I was like maybe I'll try this
one today and then finally I was like
okay you don't like this moisturizer
like if you don't like it anymore you
can stop using it it will be okay
especially because it's basically gone I
think what I don't like about it anymore
is that the smell is just too much for
me I it's always had a very intense
scent to it a very like I could like
it's right here at and I can smell it
has a very intense fragrance but for
whatever reason it didn't bother me as
much when I first got this but now it
just really bothers me so I've basically
used it all the way up so I think that
still counts but I was like okay girl
you you don't have to keep forcing
yourself to use this moisturizer if you
really don't like it but I found that
out with the project pan who knew and
then the other one this was my sleeping
cream that I picked out from first aid
beauty this is the ultra Repair Hydra
firm sleeping cream and this was one
that I really did like scrape the sides
on because I really did like this
product so this one is completely empty
I do like a lot of first aid beauty
products I really like the sleeping
cream it did last me a very long time
it's a very thick very hydrating
sleeping cream it great for overnight
great for the winter bumps I used this
one last winter and it really did come
in handy with this winter as it's been
so dry here so I really do enjoy this
guy and I also have to use it up
all righty so next up in here was the
clean and clear morning burst a facial
cleanser and I mean you can see that
there is like some left and I know
people said I could like cut it open to
get the rest of it out but I don't I
don't do that anyways I don't know it's
just it's something that I truly have
never done so I was like ah we're just
going to go ahead and call it so I
started here I got to here and now I'm
I can't pump it out I tried to like have
it tilt it down for a while and that
still don't really help so I just I just
went ahead and called it on this one too
and again this is one that I enjoy but I
wouldn't repurchase and it's not it's
not like my go-to cleanser at the moment
so when I got as far down as I couldn't
continue pumping it out I said I was
gonna go ahead and call it - so I know I
enjoyed this one in college so much I
used it super frequently but I think I
just need a little bit maybe more with
my cleansers these days but I did enjoy
this one for for several years so glad
that I used that one up this one here is
another cleanser that I had this was the
freshest soy face cleanser I have talked
about this quite a bit recently I feel
like it was in my Sephora wishlist video
my loves list video I also talked about
it in like Sephora products that never
make it out of my cart because I like
this guy but I always seem to find a
deluxe sized sample somewhere and that
is what I get whether it be a 100-point
perk or it's in a sample bag or
something like I already have another
one wide ready to go I really enjoyed
this cleanser I think it's fantastic but
for some reason I can't get myself stuff
like pay for the full size of it but I
really do like this one and I'm happy
that I already have a backup on hand
next up this is a moisturizer from
Garnier skin active the ultralift
miracle wake up crema for all-day
hydration I really enjoyed this guy and
honestly like now that I'm done with it
I'm really truly kind of thinking about
getting it again for some reason it does
say that it's for all-day hydration
which you would think like in the winter
time that's what I really want but I
remember I reach for this a lot over at
like the spring summer months the warmer
months that we have here and because
it's almost kind of like cooling at the
same time I don't know but I really did
like this guy if you're looking for a
good drugstore moisturizer I do suggest
this one from Garnier that's where I
started out and that was my check-in and
now it is completely gone it does have a
pump is how you get the product out and
I can no longer pump any product out and
then the very last product in here this
was the one that I did not finish but I
kind of felt like that was probably
going to happen this is from Dermalogica
and this is the special cleansing gel
this is my favorite cleanser at the
moment I included it in the skincare
project pan because even though I
included other
sirs I was pretty sure I was gonna be
able to use them up and then I wanted to
go back to my favorite at the moment
which is this one from Dermalogica so
since I have finish up two other
cleansers this is the one that I've been
going back to so I don't know if that's
cheating or not but that's what I did so
this is where I start it and you can see
at the check-in I hadn't made very much
progress because I was using up all of
the other cleansers and really since I
just started using them up I mean I
would say I'm about right there so still
like for this actual project pan I
haven't used up a ton of it but I really
enjoyed this cleanser and I wanted to be
able to keep using it on a consistent
basis but other than that that's the
only one out of the other products that
I chose that I did not finish and yeah
but other than that that is it for my
project pan at skincare finale I guess
oh that's everything for my skincare a
project and a finale video I hope that
you enjoyed seeing it and seeing my
first project pan video come to an end
like I said I will have Lisa's videos
and her channel linked down below and I
hope that you'll go over and check her
out if you have not yet and see how she
did on her skincare project and I'm
really excited to watch her video as
well and see how she did I feel like I
definitely learned a lot through this
project pan and by doing this one I
actually got excited and inspired to do
a project pan 2017 video so I will have
that one linked down below as well and
that one is mostly focused on makeup
though I do have a couple skincare
products in there as well but it
definitely inspired me to be able to use
stuff up because like I mentioned in my
intro video when I start to get down on
a product for some reason it like freaks
me out and I would stop using it and
then I would just let it sit there I and
so many people said you were the same
way too so I didn't feel as bad when I
saw that doing the project pants
inspired me to keep using things up and
now I'm kind of like now I'm more
excited to use up the products I thought
it was cool so I have an empties video
coming out very soon that you'll see a
bunch of empty sin and I'm really proud
to be using up some products but if you
do want to see another project pan or
any other project pan video ideas please
do let me know but other than that
that's gonna do it for this video and if
you did enjoy it I hope that you'll give
it a thumbs up I hope that you will also
consider subscribing before you go and I
will catch you guys in tomorrow's video
